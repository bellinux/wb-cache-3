40|$|The {{programmable}} cores on SoCs {{can perform}} on-chip test generation, measurement, response analysis, and even diagnosis. This software-based approach to self-testing enables at-speed testing and incurs low DFT overhead. WITH THE GROWING popularity of system-ona-chip (SoC) architectures, demands for short {{time to market}} and rich functionality have driven design houses to adopt a new core-based SoC design flow. A core-based SoC incorporates multiple complex, heterogeneous components on {{a single piece of}} silicon; these can include digital, analog, mixed-signal, RF, micromechanical, and other kinds of systems. This blurring of the boundaries between different types of devices, together with rapidly increasing operational frequencies and shrinking feature sizes, has introduced {{a whole new set of}} testing challenges. Not only are high-speed testers costly, but also their performance is increasing more slowly than device speed. Thus, externally testing SoCs translates into increasing yield loss, because guardbanding to cover tester errors results in the loss of increasingly more good chips.

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{discusses}} {{the merits of}} temporal testers, which {{can serve as a}} compositional basis for automata construction corresponding to temporal formulas in the context of LTL, PSL, and MITL <b>logics.</b> Temporal <b>testers</b> can be viewed as (non-deterministic) transducers that, at any point, output a boolean value which is 1 iff the corresponding temporal formula holds starting at the current position. The main advantage of testers, compared to acceptors (such as Büchi automata) is their compositionality. Namely, a tester for a compound formula can be con-structed out of the testers for its sub-formulas. Besides providing the construction of testers for formulas specified in LTL, PSL, and MITL, the paper also presents a general overview of the tester methodology, and highlights some of the unique features and applications of transducers including compositional deductive veri-fication of LTL properties. ...|$|R
30|$|Furthermore, {{the set of}} {{proposed}} programming concepts is not exhaustive and especially the provisioning and governance APIs are in an active state of development and refinement. However, as we have shown {{on a set of}} real-life examples, SDG-Pro offers programming support sufficient to express many common behaviors of IoT cloud applications. Although our programming model has many important traits such as readability and simplicity, as well as facilitates writing reusable and <b>portable</b> application <b>logic,</b> in SDG-Pro’s programming model, we trade flexibility and expressiveness for more intuitive and efficient programming of the IoT cloud applications. Finally, although developers utilize the well-known Java programming language, SDG-Pro introduces a number of new concepts that require an initial learning effort. However, by explicitly enforcing main design principles of software-defined IoT cloud systems, we believe that in the long-run our framework can reduce development time, potential errors and eventually the costs of application development.|$|R
40|$|The rapid {{progress}} made in integrating enormous numbers of transistors {{on a single}} chip is {{making it possible for}} hardware designers to implement more complex hardware architectures in their designs. Nowadays digital telecommunication systems are implementing several forms of SOC (System-On-Chip) structures. These SOCs usually contain a microprocessor, several DSP cores (Digital-Signal-Processors), other hardware blocks, on-chip memories and peripherals. As new IC process technologies are deployed, with decreasing geometrical dimensions, the probabilities of hardware faults to occur during operation are increasing. Testing SOCs is becoming a very complex issue due to the increasing complexity of the design and the increasing need of a test mechanism that is able to achieve acceptable fault coverage in a short test application time with low power consumption without the use of external <b>logic</b> <b>testers.</b> As a part of the overall test strategy for a SOC, functional self-testing of a DSP core is considered in this project to be applied in the field. This test is used to verify whether fault indications in systems are caused by permanent hardware faults in the DSP. If so, the DSP where the fault is located needs to be taken out of operation, and the board it sits on will be later replaced. If not, the operational state can be restored, and the system will become fully functional again. The main purpose of this project is to develop a functional self-test of a DSP core, and to evaluate the characteristics of the test. This project also involves proposing a scheme on how to apply a functional test on a DSP core in an embedded environment, and how to retrieve results from the test. The test program shall run at system speed. To develop and measure the quality of the test program, two different coverage metrics were used. The first is the code coverage metric achieved by simulating the test program on the RTL representation of the DSP. The second metric used was the fault coverage achieved. The fault coverage of the test was calculated using a commercial Fault Simulator working on a gate-level representation of the DSP. The results achieved in this report show that this proposed approach can achieve acceptable levels of fault coverage in short execution time without the need for external testers which makes it possible to perform the self-test in the field. This approach has the unique property of not requiring any hardware modifications in the DSP design, and the ability of testing several DSPs in parallel...|$|R
40|$|Individuals with walking disability, as {{a result}} of {{pathological}} conditions or traumas, show a reduction in left ventricle end diastolic volume (EDV). In fact EDV is closely related to the blood pressure gradient between the postcaval vein and the right atrium which, during locomotion, is partially due to the calf veins squeezing caused by the rhythmic contraction of the triceps surae and the crushing of the sole of the foot's veins. In this study, a mechatronic device was applied to nineteen healthy voluntary participants' lower limbs to test cardiodynamic response to a mechanical intermittent stimulation. The device consisted of inflatable bladders embedded in two shells and acting on the skin of the calf and foot of both legs. The pressure trend on the legs was regulated by a <b>portable</b> programmable <b>logic</b> controller. During the compression protocol to the legs, which involved some sequences of activation-deactivation following a peristaltic compression having a caudal-rostral trend, EDV, assessed by the impedance cardiography technique, increased of about 10 % up the pre-test value. The legs compression protocol imposed by means of our pneumatic device might be useful to avoid the negative consequences for cardiovascular performance caused by de-conditioning status linked to walking disabilities...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- Often {{implementation}} of the program will change. Implementations are changed to reduce running time and/or to reduce memory consumption (space complexity) of the program. Often there is need to test the two version of the software, one current and another newer version. Newer version will be having some extra methods/functions, but the remaining methods/functions will be {{same as that of}} current version. We {{need to make sure that}} these methods of current version have not been affected by the changes done in new version. (Regression Testing), and also often the methods will be refactored to different prototypes/signatures to offer abstraction. These new prototyped methods (signature changed methods) will intern invoke the previous method (before to new prototyping), i. e. newer prototyped methods are just wrappers around the previous methods. For instance APIs are wrapped around by corresponding methods. In this situation, it becomes important to test the newly prototyp ed methods that are wrappers around the old methods/APIs, as we need to verify the correct bindings/mappings of the older and newly prototyped methods. Usually developers write the unit tests to test their <b>logic.</b> But the <b>testers</b> cannot write them as tester lacks the knowledge of <b>logic</b> implemented, and <b>tester</b> may not have any knowledge of coding, but tester knows what each method does and what is it’s expected behavior/return type. Thus we need to offer new way to test each method. We propose a novel framework, which addresses these important issues. Framework takes three input parameters namely, class to be tested, variable initialization values (test data), and expected results. From this information, framework automatically builds test driver class at runtime; on the fly on running the framework. Test driver class is used to test the class under test. This test driver class is compiled and executed to get the actual results for class under test. These generated actual results are compared with expected result to find methods different behaviors. Methods whose actual result is not matching with the expected result, then this implies that methods have different behavior, thus the test is failure, an...|$|R
40|$|Oxide {{semiconductors}} {{are considered}} {{to be one of the}} forefront candidates for the new generation, high-performance electronics. However, one of the major limitations for oxide electronics is the scarcity of an equally good hole-conducting semiconductor, which can provide identical performance for the p-type metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors as compared to their electron conducting counterparts. In this quest, here we present a bulk synthesis method for single crystalline cuprous oxide (Cu 2 O) nanowires, their chemical and morphological characterization and suitability as active channel material in electrolyte-gated, low-power, field-effect transistors (FETs) for <b>portable</b> and flexible <b>logic</b> circuits. The bulk synthesis method used in the present study includes two steps: namely hydrothermal synthesis of the nanowires and the removal of the surface organic contaminants.

The characteristic electrical properties of individual nanowire FETs are found to be quite interesting including accumulation-mode operation and field-effect mobility of 0. 15 cm(2) V- 1 s(- 1) ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores missionary training pedagogies {{among the}} Assemblies of God (AG), a global pentecostal fellowship. Tensions between systematicity and the sensory manifesting via meticulous pedagogies, <b>portable</b> body <b>logics,</b> and evental ruptures contributed to AG's growth {{from a few}} thousand to over 67 million in the past 100 years. "Missionary conversions" meant US missionaries transformed political-theology through encounter with postcolonial interlocutors and came home to provoke AG with newfound cultural sensitivity and compassion ministries. Similarly, pedagogy at AG's Bethany University inoculated students against secularism via encounter with it. Thus, AG shifted from rigid fundamentalism to a more fluid evangelicalism with kingdom theology challenging previous pessimistic premillenialisms. Bethany was closed through a schism between evangelical-pentecostals and fundamentalist-pentecostals in 2011. Tracing techniques that render bodies capable of mystical experience from 1800 s radical evangelicals to current AG practice and its training manuals suggests that instead of "discipline" or the "Age of Mobilization," cultivating tension between systematicity and the sensory characterizes modern evangelicalism, perhaps modernity itself. For pentecostals "cultivation" signals collective self-fashioning that aspires towards skilled yielding to the Holy Spirit. As such, modern religiosity might be less about turning inward, than about inhabiting modern rationality. Further, pentecostal practice provides a foil for post-structural mobilization theories responding to similar tensions within modernity. Resonances between pentecostal missionary strategies and post-structural "agency," "resistance," and the "event" when thought with the pentecostal penchant for right wing politics suggests such strategies are politically empty. That pentecostals incite Western agency-anxiety with collective and yielded practices stretches agency to include explicit rendering of relational hierarchies and the recognition of scale effects and scale battles. In all, pentecostal volitional affect involves sedimenting practices of mutability into the bodies of practitioners via the rhythmic cellular thrumming of flesh, church, and doctrine. Here, ephemeral sensations and testimony solidify into durable sensibilities, aptitudes, and rites, congeal as tradition tied to training texts or scripture, and the crystalline structures enabling rupture - conversion, experience of spirit, and schism - emerge to catch the edges of modern capitalist proliferation and suggest a model for mobilization effective {{in a period of}} neoliberal globalization...|$|R

In the past few years, some {{work has been done}} on exploiting techniques from test to solve problems in verification and vice versa. Adding to that this research is to provide success in providing an ideal environment for cross-examination of test and verification experiences and innovative solutions for testing Microprocessor using logic analyzer. This thesis is about design of inexpensive method for testing environment that simplifies functional testing of Microprocessor and complete circuit tester. This environment consists of the tester hardware and its corresponding software which enables engineers to experience the challenges of testing and debugging without the expense of costly commercial hardware testers. Simple digital circuits can be constructed using breadboards, wires, and DUTs, then tested using switches and LED's. However, advanced Microprocessor are often too complex to be tested, and debugged in this way, due to the large amount of state they may require and the larger number of input and output signals compared with simple projects.

40|$|The {{major problem}} of {{robotics}} research {{today is that}} there is a huge barrier to entry into Robotics research due to system software complexity and need for a researcher to learn more about details, dependencies and intricacies of the complete system. This is because a robot system needs several different modules to communicate and execute in parallel. Today there are not much controlled comparisons of algorithms and solutions for a given task, which is the standard scientific method of other sciences. There is also very little sharing between groups and projects, requiring code to be written from scratch over and over again. This paper is to describe exploratory research on the design of a modular autonomous mobile robot controller. The controller incorporates a fuzzy logic [8] [9] approach for steering and speed control [37], a FL approach for ultrasound sensing and an overall expert system for guidance. The advantages of a modular system are related to portability and transportability, i. e. any vehicle can become autonomous with minimal modifications. A mobile robot test bed has been constructed in university of Cincinnati using a golf cart base. This cart has full speed control with guidance provided by a vision system and obstacle avoidance using ultrasonic sensors. The speed and steering fuzzy logic controller is supervised through a multi-axis motion controller. The obstacle avoidance system is based on a microcontroller interfaced with ultrasonic transducers. This micro-controller independently handles all timing and distance calculations and sends distance information back to the fuzzy logic controller via the serial line. This design yields a portable independent system in which high speed computer communication is not necessary. Vision guidance has been accomplished with the use of CCD cameras judging the current position of the robot. [34] [35][36] It will be generating a good image for reducing an uncertain wrong command from ground coordinate to tackle the parameter uncertainties of the system, and to obtain good WMR dynamic response.

This design, in its modularity, creates a <b>portable</b> autonomous fuzzy <b>logic</b> controller applicable to any mobile vehicle with only minor adaptations...|$|R
