40|$|ABSTRACT: Large {{amplitude}} {{free vibration}} analyses of thin-to-moderately thick angle-ply laminated rectangular <b>plates</b> <b>with</b> <b>edges</b> rotationally restrained against rotation are investigated using the differential quadrature method (DQM). The governing equations {{are based on}} two different theories: thin or classical plate theory and the first order shear deformation plate theory. In both theories, Green’s strain {{in conjunction with the}} von Karman assumption is employed. The boundary conditions are implemented precisely at boundary grid points and are built into the equations of motion without any extra efforts. After transforming the governing equations from temporal to frequency domain, a direct iterative method is used to solve the nonlinear eigenvalue system of equations. The convergence of the method is shown and its accuracy is demonstrated by comparing the results with those for limit cases, i. e., laminated <b>plates</b> <b>with</b> classical boundary conditions and also for linear free vibration analysis of laminated <b>plates</b> <b>with</b> restrained <b>edges.</b> Finally, the effects of different parameters on the ratio of nonlinear to linear natural frequency of plates are studied.

For small deflections the results coincide with those obtained by Hencky from the linear theory. The maximum stresses and center deflection at high pressures differ less than 3 percent from those derived by Bostnov for an infinitely long <b>plate</b> <b>with</b> clamped <b>edges.</b> This agreement suggests that clamped <b>plates</b> <b>with</b> a length-to-width ratio greater than 1. 5 may be reared as infinitely long plates for purposes of design...|$|R

40|$|The bending {{solutions}} of rectangular thick <b>plate</b> <b>with</b> all <b>edges</b> clamped {{and supported}} were investigated in this study.

These equations are coded in terms of deflection of the plate and the mentioned functions. By solving these decoupled equations, the analytic solutions of rectangular thick <b>plate</b> <b>with</b> all <b>edges</b> clamped and supported have been derived.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to determine the relative proportions of the flange angles necessary to make an axially compressed plate reach any buckling strength up to 60, 000 psi. ^ The principal variables which were investigated were the L/b ratio for the plate, the b/t ratio for the plate, and the size of edge angles. Steel of various yield points was used, with the maximum being about 75, 000 psi. The range of the variables was so chosen as to cover the current practice and extend considerably above the values now being generally used. ^ Eighty column specimens have been tested under axial compression with lateral support so arranged as to simulate the effect of lacing bars as used in column design. The specimens were built up channels each consisting of a web <b>plate</b> <b>with</b> <b>edge</b> angles on one face. The test columns are arranged in fifteen series such that the only variable for a given series is the size of edge angles used. ^ SR- 4 strain gages were used to determine the stress distribution throughout the member and to measure the stresses during buckling. Mechanical dial indicators were used to determine the overall change in length of the specimen and the lateral deflections due to the axial loading. ^ Lateral support for the specimens was provided at the third points along each edge of the plate. ^ Principal results and conclusions are as follows: (1) It is possible to stiffen <b>plates</b> <b>with</b> <b>edge</b> angles so that they will carry the stress given by the Bryan formula for an axially compressed <b>plate</b> <b>with</b> simple supports along the longitudinal edges. (2) Present methods of analysis do check the experimental results. (3) With proper care the current limit of b/t for web plates may be considerably exceeded.
