5000|$|Bentley {{wrote in}} her 1951 {{autobiography}} {{that she had been}} [...] "able through Harry Dexter White to arrange that the United States Treasury Department turn the actual printing plates over to the Russians". Bentley had not previously mentioned this to the FBI or to any of the committees, grand juries or prosecutors before whom she had testified earlier, and there was no evidence at the time that Bentley had any role in this transfer. Some questioned Harry Dexter White's role in it.

During the performance, word arrives that the French have recaptured the fort. Maréchal interrupts the show, and the French prisoners spontaneously burst into [...] "La Marseillaise". As {{a result of the}} disruption, Maréchal is placed in solitary confinement, where he suffers badly from lack of human contact and hunger; ironically, the fort changes hands once more while he is imprisoned. Boeldieu and Maréchal also help their fellow prisoners to finish digging an escape tunnel. However, just before it is completed, everyone is transferred to other camps.

[...] John Eames turned away and shook his head. Nevertheless, the words of his friend were grateful to him.

Both ships were lost after a fierce battle. On the morning of 24 November Aquitania en route to Sydney from Singapore spotted and picked up twenty-six survivors of the German ship but maintained radio silence and did not <b>pass</b> <b>word</b> until in visual range of Wilson's Promontory on 27 November. The captain had gone against orders not to stop for survivors of sinkings. There were no survivors from Sydney.|$|E
5000|$|Espionage {{is illegal}} in the UK under the Official Secrets Acts of 1911 and 1920. The UK law under this {{legislation}} considers espionage as actions [...] "intend to help an enemy and deliberately harm {{the security of}} the nation". According to MI5, a person will be charged with the crime of espionage if they, [...] "for any purpose prejudicial to the safety or interests of the State": approaches, enters or inspects a prohibited area; makes documents such as plans that are intended, calculated, or could directly or indirectly be of use to an enemy; or [...] "obtains, collects, records, or publishes, or communicates to any other person any secret official code word, or <b>pass</b> <b>word,</b> or any sketch, plan, model, article, or note, or other document which is calculated to be or might be or is intended to be directly or indirectly useful to an enemy". The illegality of espionage also includes any action which may be considered 'preparatory to' spying, or encouraging or aiding another to spy.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the evening}} of 1 April, Douro passed Spain′s Cape Finisterre under a full moon. Her fourth officer noticed the Spanish steamer [...] about two {{nautical}} miles (2.3 miles; 3.7 km) away but assumed that the officer on the bridge had also spotted her and did not <b>pass</b> <b>word</b> of the sighting to him. The officer on the bridge only sighted Yrurac Bat later, when {{it was too late}} to avoid a collision, and at 22:45 hours on 1 April Yrurac Bat rammed Douro. Yrurac Bat′s bow cut two deep gashes in Douro′s starboard side. The passengers and crew of Douro abandoned ship in a great hurry, and Douro sank 30 minutes after the collision in 1,500 feet (457 meters) of water. There were six fatalities - her captain, Ebenezer C. Kemp, and five other officers who went down with the ship - among those aboard Douro, but the other 32 members of her crew and all 112 of her passengers survived. Yrurac Bat sank soon after Douro with the loss of another 53 lives. The survivors were rescued soon after the disaster by the British Hull-registered steamer , which took them to A Coruña, Spain.|$|E

5000|$|Harris knew gunman Ben Thompson {{from their}} {{service in the}} army. In 1880, Thompson spent some time at the Vaudeville, {{gambling}} heavily alongside Harris' partner, Joe Foster, and with Thompson losing. Thompson left in what {{was referred to as}} a [...] "bad mood", and although it was reported he made threats, that has never been substantiated. Thompson returned to Austin, where in addition to being Chief of Police, he owned the Iron Front Saloon. Harris and Foster sent word to Thompson that he was no longer welcome in their establishment. Had Harris simply told Thompson that, rather than vocally expressing that Thompson was not welcome in his business in public, the matter would have likely stopped there. However, upon receiving word that Harris was telling many people that he told Thompson he wasn't welcome and he wasn't to return, Thompson simply returned on July 11, 1882. Vaudeville Variety Theater manager Billy Simms met Thompson on the street, and tried to persuade him to avoid the Vaudeville, but was unsuccessful. Thompson entered, and approached the bartender, and told him to <b>pass</b> <b>word</b> to both Foster and Harris that he intended to [...] "close this damn whorehouse". Although it can be taken different ways, he likely meant that he intended to stay all night there, rather than meaning it literally.|$|E
50|$|In a {{disaster}} or emergency situation, {{there is a}} need for hospitals to be able to communicate with each other, and with other members of the emergency response community. The ability to exchange data in regard to hospitals’ bed availability, status, services, and capacity enables both hospitals and other emergency agencies to respond to emergencies and disaster situations with greater efficiency and speed. In particular, it will allow emergency dispatchers and managers to make sound logistics decisions - where to route victims, which hospitals have the ability to provide the needed service. Many hospitals have expressed the need for, and indeed are currently using, commercial or self-developed information technology that allows them to publish this information to other hospitals in a region, as well as EOCs, 9-1-1 centers, and EMS responders via a Web-based tool. Systems that are available today do not record or present data in a standardized format, creating a serious barrier to data sharing between hospitals and emergency response groups. Without data standards, parties of various kinds are unable to view data from hospitals in a state or region that use a different system - unless a specialized interface is developed. Alternatively, such officials must get special passwords and toggle between web pages to get a full picture. Other local emergency responders are unable to get the data imported into the emergency IT tools they use (e.g. a 9-1-1 computer-aided dispatch system or an EOC consequence information management system). They too must get a <b>pass</b> <b>word</b> and go to the appropriate web page. This is very inefficient. A uniform data standard will allow different applications and systems to communicate seamlessly.|$|E
