60|$|A {{different}} story {{has to be}} told {{with regard to the}} language. To begin with, there are no fewer than 34 species of which no sound-impressions were received. These include the habitually silent kinds--the stork, which rattles its beak but makes no vocal sound, the <b>painted</b> <b>snipe,</b> the wood ibis, and a few more; species which were rarely seen and emitted no sound--condor, Muscovy duck, harpy eagle, and others; species which were known only as winter visitants, or seen on migration, and which at such seasons were invariably silent.|$|E
50|$|All {{three species}} of painted-snipe {{generally}} inhabit reedy swamps and marshes, usually in lowlands. Outside of the breeding season painted-snipes are generally solitary in habits. <b>Painted</b> <b>snipes</b> are crepuscular or even slightly nocturnal in their habits.|$|R
50|$|Other birds {{recorded}} as sometimes occurring on the wetlands in relatively substantial numbers include black swans, Pacific black ducks, grey teals, Australian shelducks, Australasian shovellers, pink-eared ducks, hardheads, black-backed bitterns, Australian white ibises, hoary-headed grebes, Eurasian coots, sharp-tailed sandpipers, red-necked stints, marsh sandpipers, white-headed stilts, double-banded plovers, red-kneed dotterels, red-capped plovers and whiskered terns. Australian <b>painted</b> <b>snipes</b> {{have been recorded}} from Hird Swamp in the IBA.|$|R
5000|$|The {{site has}} been {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because the riverine red gum forest constitutes one of three breeding areas of the vulnerable superb parrot. The boundaries of the IBA are broadly defined as known superb parrot breeding habitat with a 10 km buffer zone of foraging habitat. It supports from 2000 to 4000 individual birds. [...] Other notable birds recorded in the IBA include black-backed and Australasian bitterns, Australian <b>painted</b> <b>snipes,</b> bush stone-curlews, diamond firetails, flame robins and painted honeyeaters.|$|R
60|$|Coots, however, {{were common}} everywhere, but this water {{was the only}} breeding-place of the grebe in our neighbourhood; yet here we could find scores of nests any day--scores with eggs and a still greater number of false nests, and we could never tell which had eggs in it before pulling off the {{covering}} of wet weeds. Another bird rarely seen at any other spot than this was the <b>painted</b> <b>snipe,</b> a prettily-marked species with a green curved bill. It has curiously sluggish habits, rising only when almost trodden upon, and going off in a wild sacred manner like a nocturnal species, then dropping again into hiding at a short distance. The natives call it dormilon--sleepy-head. On {{one side of the}} lagoon, where the ground was swampy and wet, there was always a breeding-colony of these quaint birds; at every few yards one would spring up close to the hoofs, and dismounting we would find the little nest on the wet ground under the grass, always with two eggs so thickly blotched all over with black as to appear almost entirely black.|$|E
60|$|Two {{miles from}} my home there stood an old mud-built house, {{thatched}} with rushes, and shaded by a few ancient half-dead trees. Here lived a very old woman with her two unmarried daughters, both withered and grey as their mother; indeed, in appearance, they were three amiable sister witches, all very very old. The high ground on which the house stood sloped down to an extensive reed- and rush-grown marsh, the source of an important stream; it was a paradise of wild fowl, swan, roseate spoonbill, herons white and herons grey, ducks {{of half a dozen}} species, snipe and <b>painted</b> <b>snipe,</b> and stilt, plover and godwit; the glossy ibis, and the great crested blue ibis with a powerful voice. All these interested, I might say fascinated, me less than the tame geese that spent most of their time in or on the borders of the marsh in the company of the wild birds. The three old women were so fond of their geese that they would not part with one for love or money; the most they would ever do would be to present an egg, in the laying season, to some visitor as a special mark of esteem.|$|E
60|$|The largest aquatic {{order is}} that of the Limicolse--snipes, plover, and their allies--which has about twenty-five species. The vociferous spur-winged lapwing; the {{beautiful}} black and white stilt; a true snipe, and a <b>painted</b> <b>snipe,</b> are, strictly speaking, the only residents; and it is astonishing to find, that, of the five-and-twenty species, at least thirteen are visitors from North America, several of them having their breeding-places quite away in the Arctic regions. This is one of those facts concerning the annual migration of birds which almost stagger belief; for among them are species with widely different habits, upland, marsh and sea-shore birds, and in their great biannual journey they pass through a variety of climates, visiting many countries where the conditions seem suited to their requirements. Nevertheless, in September, and even as early as August, they begin to arrive on the pampas, the golden plover often still wearing his black nuptial dress; singly and in pairs, in small flocks, and in clouds they come--curlew, godwit, plover, tatler, tringa--piping the wild notes to which the Greenlander listened in June, now to the gaucho herdsman on the green plains of La Plata, then to the wild Indian in his remote village; and soon, further south, to the houseless huanaco-hunter in the grey wilderness of Patagonia.|$|E
50|$|The {{core of the}} wetland {{system has}} been {{identified}} as an 1186 km2 Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports over 200,000 waterbirds when extensively flooded. It has periodically supported over 1% of the world populations of Australian pelicans and straw-necked ibises, their breeding colonies being among the largest recorded in the Australian tropics. Other birds which have bred in the IBA in relatively large numbers include freckled ducks, great and intermediate egrets, glossy ibises, gull-billed terns, magpie geese, plumed whistling-ducks, grey teals and hardheads. Nationally vulnerable Australian <b>painted</b> <b>snipes</b> bred at Tarrabool in 1993.|$|R
50|$|The {{wetlands}} {{have been}} identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because they support more breeding waterbirds than any other Australian site when they adequately flooded. Of {{more than half a million}} nesting waterbirds the wetlands may hold over 1% of the world populations of Australian white (up to 160,000 birds) and straw-necked ibises (up to 230,000), nankeen night herons (up to about 100,000) and intermediate egrets (up to about 45,000). Other waterbirds that have bred in the area in relatively large numbers include royal and yellow-billed spoonbills, little and great egrets, and glossy ibises. Australasian bitterns, Australian <b>painted</b> <b>snipes</b> and <b>painted</b> honeyeaters have been recorded.|$|R
5000|$|The Macquarie Marshes {{have been}} {{identified}} by BirdLife International as a 2378 km2 Important Bird Area (IBA), defined by the maximum extent of the 1990 floods.

6000|$|It took us an {{hour and}} more to cross the cup of the {{volcanic}} plain, and another half-hour or so to climb the edge on the farther side. Once there, however, the view was a very fine one. Before us was a long steep slope of grassy plain, broken here and there by clumps of trees mostly of the thorn tribe. At {{the bottom of this}} gentle slope, some nine or ten miles away, we could make out a dim sea of marsh, over which the foul vapours hung like smoke about a city. It was easy going for the bearers down the slopes, and by midday we had reached the borders of the dismal swamp. Here we halted to eat our midday meal, and then, following a winding and devious path, plunged into the morass. Presently the path, at any rate to our unaccustomed eyes, grew so faint as to be almost indistinguishable from those made by the aquatic beasts and birds, and it is to this day a mystery to me how our bearers found their way across the marshes. Ahead of the cavalcade marched two men with long poles, which they now and again plunged into the ground before them, the reason of this being that the nature of the soil frequently changed from causes with which I am not acquainted, so that places which might be safe enough to cross one month would certainly swallow the wayfarer the next. Never did I see a more dreary and depressing scene. Miles on miles of quagmire, varied only by bright green strips of comparatively solid ground, and by deep and sullen pools fringed with tall rushes, in which the bitterns boomed and the frogs croaked incessantly: miles on miles of it without a break, unless the fever fog can be called a break. The only life in this great morass was that of the aquatic birds, and the animals that fed on them, of both of which there were vast numbers. Geese, cranes, ducks, teal, coot, snipe, and plover swarmed all around us, many being of varieties that were quite new to me, and all so tame that one could almost have knocked them over with a stick. Among these birds I especially noticed a very beautiful variety of <b>painted</b> <b>snipe,</b> almost the size of a woodcock, and with a flight more resembling that bird's than an English snipe's. In the pools, too, was a species of small alligator or enormous iguana, I do not know which, that fed, Billali told me, upon the waterfowl, also large quantities of a hideous black water-snake, of which the bite is very dangerous, though not, I gathered, so deadly as a cobra's or a puff adder's. The bull-frogs were also very large, and with voices proportionate to their size; and as for the mosquitoes--the [...] "musqueteers," [...] as Job called them--they were, if possible, even worse than they had been on the river, and tormented us greatly. Undoubtedly, however, the worst feature of the swamp was the awful smell of rotting vegetation that hung about it, which was at times positively overpowering, and the malarious exhalations that accompanied it, which we were of course obliged to breathe.|$|E

50|$|The seedsnipes {{are a small}} family, Thinocoridae, {{of small}} gregarious waders which have adapted to a herbivorous diet. The family {{is divided into two}} genera, Attagis and Thinocorus, each {{containing}} two species. The family has a South American distribution, in the Andean and Patagonian regions. The relationships with other families within the order Charadriiformes are uncertain, {{it has been suggested that}} the plains wanderer of Australia, the jacanas and the <b>painted</b> <b>snipes</b> are their closest relatives. The plains wanderer in particular has a similar feeding ecology, although differs markedly in breeding biology. The family's common name is misleading, as they do not resemble true snipe, having short bills on small heads, and seeds do not form a major part of the diet.|$|R

60|$|The {{females of}} the three species of <b>Painted</b> <b>Snipes</b> (Rhynchæa) “are not only larger, but much more richly {{coloured}} than the males.”[244] With all other birds, in which the trachea differs in structure in the two sexes it is more developed and complex in the male than in the female; but in the Rhynchæa Australis it is simple in the male, whilst in the female it makes four distinct convolutions before entering the lungs.[245] The female therefore of this species has acquired an eminently masculine character. Mr. Blyth ascertained, by examining many specimens, that the trachea is not convoluted in either sex of R. Bengalensis, which species so closely resembles R. Australis that it can hardly be distinguished except by its shorter toes. This fact is another striking instance {{of the law that}} secondary sexual characters are often widely different in closely-allied forms; though it is a very rare circumstance when such differences relate to the female sex. The young of both sexes of R. Bengalensis in their first plumage are said to resemble the mature male.[246] There is also {{reason to believe that the}} male undertakes the duty of incubation, for Mr. Swinhoe[247] found the females before the close of the summer associated in flocks, as occurs with the females of the Turnix.|$|R
50|$|The Paroo River {{wetlands}} in north-western New South Wales {{are important}} for threatened species such as the freckled duck and the Australian <b>painted</b> <b>snipe.</b> They lie within the Paroo Floodplain and Currawinya Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance, when conditions are suitable, for large numbers of waterbirds.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the land}} covered by the two {{wetlands}} has been identified by BirdLife International as a 328 ha Important Bird Area because it supports significant numbers of the endangered Australasian bittern and over 1% of the world populations of glossy ibis and sharp-tailed sandpiper. The wetlands also provide habitat for the Australian <b>painted</b> <b>snipe</b> and Tuckerbil serves as an important flocking area for brolgas.|$|E
50|$|In charadriiform birds, recent {{research}} has shown clearly that polyandry and sex-role reversal (where males care and females compete for mates) as found in phalaropes, jacanas, <b>painted</b> <b>snipe</b> and a few plover species is clearly related to a strongly male-biased adult sex ratio. Those species with male care and polyandry invariably have adult sex ratios with a large surplus of males, which in some cases can reach as high as six males per female.|$|E

5000|$|An area of 593.2 km2 {{located at}} the {{northern}} of the wetland system and that is specifically associated {{with a number of}} water bodies has been identified as an important bird area by Birdlife International because it supports “more than 1% of the world populations of 12 species of waterbird and shorebird” as well as “populations of the vulnerable Australian <b>painted</b> <b>snipe,</b> the near threatened blue-billed duck, the restricted-range Eyrean grasswren and five species restricted to the arid biome.” ...|$|E

Tanks and other water bodies at places like Janawada, Elaspur, Solpur, Papnash, Hallikhed, and Tripurant in the district, which have large quantities of fish and other aquatic animals, provide feeding grounds to various migratory birds like, black-necked stork, great stone plover, marsh sandpiper, and <b>painted</b> <b>snipe.</b>|$|E
50|$|A snipe is any {{of about}} 25 wading bird species in three genera {{in the family}} Scolopacidae. They are {{characterized}} by a very long, slender bill and crypsis, or camouflage, plumage. The Gallinago snipes have a nearly worldwide distribution, the Lymnocryptes snipe is restricted to Asia and Europe and the Coenocorypha snipes are found only in the outlying islands of New Zealand. The three species of <b>painted</b> <b>snipe</b> are not {{closely related to the}} typical snipes, and are placed in their own family, the Rostratulidae.|$|E
50|$|The {{wetlands}} {{contain a}} wide range of vegetation types, primarily determined by the frequency and duration of flooding. The dominant types are river red gum forest and woodland, as well as extensive beds of common reed. Various vegetation associations are found throughout the wetlands, providing habitat for many species of waterbird, as well as other wildlife including 211 bird species, 8 species of native mammal, 15 frog, 56 reptile and 24 native fish species. The wetlands {{are one of the most}} important breeding sites in Australia for intermediate egret and straw-necked ibis. A number of birds are listed as vulnerable or threatened including the magpie goose, blue-billed duck, freckled duck, Australasian bittern, brolga, <b>painted</b> <b>snipe,</b> osprey, glossy black cockatoo, turquoise parrot, square-tailed kite and Major Mitchell's cockatoo.|$|E
5000|$|It was {{formerly}} {{believed to be}} related to the buttonquails and thus placed in the gamebird order Galliformes or with the cranes and rails in Gruiformes. DNA-DNA hybridization and RAG-1 sequence data places it as a wader related to the jacanas (Sibley & Ahlquist 1990, Paton et al. 2003, Thomas et al. 2004, van Tuinen et al. 2004). It thus represents a remarkable case of morphological convergence, or perhaps it is simply extremely plesiomorphic in morphology (the buttonquails, meanwhile, having turned out to be a very basal offshoot of the wader radiation). In the latter case, this would mean that the jacanas, <b>painted</b> <b>snipe</b> and seedsnipes [...] - [...] all ecologically very different birds [...] - [...] all evolved from birds very similar to the living plains-wanderer.|$|E
50|$|The flood plains are {{especially}} important for the diversity and richness of their avifauna, particularly migrant birds. The rare species lesser adjutant Leptoptilos javanicus and variety of other species inhabit the floodplains. It {{has been estimated that}} around 75 species winter in the swamps of the flood plains. Frequently seen residents are marsh sandpiper Tringa stagnatilis, wood sandpiper T. glareola, Asiatic golden plover Pluvialis dominica, garganey Anas querquedula, osprey Pandion haliaetus, and black-tailed godwit Limosa limosa. Common residents are eastern large egret Egreta alba, cattle egret Bubulcus ibis, Painted stork Ibis leucocephala, pond heron Ardeola grayii, eastern grey heron Ardea cinerea, pheasant-tailed jacana Hydrophasianus chirurgus, purple coot Porphyrio porphyrio, Indian darter Anhinga rufa, little cormorant Phalacrocorax niger, Indian shag P. fuscicollis, Indian cormorant P. carbo sinensis, brahminy kite Haliastur indus, <b>painted</b> <b>snipe</b> Rostratula benghalensis, black-winged stilt Himantopus himantopus, and red-wattled lapwing Vanellus indicus.|$|E
50|$|The {{wetlands}} {{located in}} the park are important in the region because they provide a refuge for many species during times of drought. After floods when the lakes are full {{they are able to}} support large numbers of aquatic species and waterbirds. Arial surveys counted 35900 waterbirds comprising 42 species on Peery Lake in 1993 and 28000 waterbirds comprising 35 species on Poloko Lake in 1990. The numbers of waterbirds that the lake supports is highly variable fluctuating in response to water levels. Peery and Poloko Lake also provide important habitat for migratory shorebirds that are covered by international bird agreements JAMBA, CAMBA and ROKAMBA. There have been five waterbird species listed under the NSW TSC Act recorded in the park. They are freckled duck (Stictonetta naevosa), blue-billed duck (Oxyura australis), brolga (Grus rubicunda), <b>painted</b> <b>snipe</b> (Rostratula benghalensis), and black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa).|$|E

40|$|D. J. Opperman, one of {{the most}} {{prominent}} Afrikaans poets of the 20 th century, often used birds as symbols and metaphors to describe or reinforce human emotions or conduct. This is especially evident in Heilige beeste (1945), Negester oor Ninevé (1947), Komas uit 'n bamboesstok (1979), and a volume he was working on before he suffered a debilitating stroke, Sonklong oor Afrika. With reference to two unfinished poems from Sonklong oor Afrika, "Die goue snip van Afrika" and "Arende broei adellik", and without arguing for or against the posthumous publication of unfinished work, it is concluded that - a. Opperman is not a traditional nature poet; his poetry is anthropocentric rather than ecocentric; b. the alternative text proposed for "Die goue snip van Afrika" provides a more accurate ornithological description of the behaviour of the <b>painted</b> <b>snipe</b> (goudsnip) than the Kannemeyer text; and c. the descriptions of the behaviour and habits of the <b>painted</b> <b>snipe</b> and the eagles in these two works are bio-regionally accurate.

40|$|The diverse {{breeding}} bird fauna of Israel comprises elements from various zoogeographical regions. This is predominantly {{attributed to the}} zoogeo-graphic position of Israel and its high habitat diversity. In this article I provide information on six bird species new to breeding in Israel since 1995 : green-backed heron (Butorides striatus), purple gallinule (Porphyrio porphyrio), <b>painted</b> <b>snipe</b> (Rostratula benghalensis), thick-billed lark (Rhamphocoris clotbey), wallcreeper (Tichodroma muraria), and common mynah (Acrido-theres tristis). The data provided here on the breeding habits of each species vary in extent. A recently fledged wallcreeper comprises the only indication of the species ’ breeding in the country, or near its borders. In the cases of the purple gallinule and the <b>painted</b> <b>snipe,</b> adults were found rearing their young, while the green-backed heron and, especially, the thick-billed lark were studied throughout their entire breeding period. The common mynah is a recently introduced species whose local breeding features {{have not yet been}} thoroughly studied. The wallcreeper has a Central Palearctic distribution, while the remaining species or subspecies have a desert distribution within the Palearctic or a Paleotropic distribution. It is striking that most of the local breeding events of these species are closely connected to human-induced habitat modifications.
