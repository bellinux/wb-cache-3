A spectroscopic, {{photometric}} {{and evolutionary}} study is presented for HD 112989, an active <b>peculiar</b> <b>giant</b> <b>star.</b> The present spectroscopic observations show a significant CaII K&H emission core variability, whereas the UBV photometry shows that HD 112989 has a variable brightness.

The percentage of binaries with periods from those allowed by the Roche lobe limit {{and up to the}} limit set by dynamical disruption is about a factor five smaller than among G dwarfs in the solar vicinity in the same period range. Assuming a similar period distribution in ! Cen as for the nearby G dwarfs, we estimate the global binary frequency in ! Cen to be as low as 3 [...] 4 %. In contrast to similar stars in the field, the rich population of chemically <b>peculiar</b> <b>giant</b> <b>stars</b> (Ba, CH, S) in ! Cen seems to have a rather low binary frequency.

40|$|Principles of coronal heating via basic {{electrodynamic}} effects, viz., resonant {{absorption of}} Alfven surface waves (quiescent) and magnetic tearing instabilities (impulsive), are detailed to argue three principles {{which may have}} application to late-type evolved stars. First, if one observes that B-squared/ 8 pi {{is much greater than}} rho times v-squared in a stellar atmosphere, then the observed magnetic field must originate in an interior dynamo. Second, low mass-loss rates could imply the presence of closed magnetic flux loops within the outer atmosphere, which constrain hydrodynamic flows when the magnetic body forces exceed the driving forces. Third, given that such magnetic loops effect an enhancement of the local heating rate, a positive correlation is predicted between the existence of a corona and low mass-loss rates. Application of these principles is made {{in the case of the}} <b>peculiar</b> M <b>giant</b> <b>star</b> HD 4174, which is purported to have a kilogauss magnetic field.

40|$|IUE low {{dispersion}} observations {{were made of}} the T(sub c) -deficient <b>peculiar</b> red <b>giant</b> (PRG) <b>star,</b> HDE 332077, {{to test the hypothesis}} that T(sub c) -poor PRG's are formed as a result of mass transfer from a binary companion rather than from internal thermal pulsing while on the asymptotic red giant branch. Previous ground-based observations of this star indicated that it is a binary, but the secondary star was too massive for an expected white dwarf. A deep, short wavelength prime (SWP) exposure was needed to search for evidence of an A-type main-sequence companion. We obtained a 120 minute LWP exposure (LWP 23479), followed by a collaborative 1230 minute SWP exposure (SWP 45113).

40|$|While {{the search}} for exoplanets around main {{sequence}} stars more massive than the Sun have found relatively few such objects, surveys performed around <b>giant</b> <b>stars</b> {{have led to the}} discovery of more than 30 new exoplanets. The interest in studying planet hosting <b>giant</b> <b>stars</b> resides in the possibility of investigating planet formation around stars more massive than the Sun. Masses of isolated <b>giant</b> <b>stars</b> up to now were only estimated from evolutionary tracks, which led to different results depending on the physics considered. To calibrate the theory, it is therefore important to measure a large number of <b>giant</b> <b>star</b> diameters and masses as much as possible independent of physical models. We aim in the determination of diameters and effective temperatures of 5 <b>giant</b> <b>stars,</b> one of which is known to host a planet. AMBER/VLTI observations with the ATs were executed in low resolution mode on 5 <b>giant</b> <b>stars.</b> In order to measure high accurate calibrated squared visibilities, a calibrator-star-calibrator observational sequence was performed. We measured the uniform disk and limb-darkened angular diameters of 4 <b>giant</b> <b>stars.</b> The effective temperatures were also derived by combining the bolometric luminosities and the interferometric diameters. Lower effective temperatures were found when compared to spectroscopic measurements. The <b>giant</b> <b>star</b> HD 12438 was found to have an unknown companion star at an angular separation of ~ 12 mas.

We performed a spectral analysis of 145 bright <b>giant</b> <b>stars</b> (luminosity class II) spanning the spectral range from F 3 to K 5. All these stars have homogeneous rotational velocity measurements {{available in the}} literature. Results:. For all {{the stars of the}} sample, we provide consistent lithium abundances (A_Li), effective temperatures (T_eff), projected rotational velocity (v sin i), mean metallicity ([Fe/H]), stellar mass, and an indication of the stellar multiplicity. The gradual decrease in lithium abundance with T_eff is confirmed for bright <b>giant</b> <b>stars,</b> and it points to a dilution factor that is at least as significant as in <b>giant</b> <b>stars.</b> From the F to K spectral types, the A_Li spans at least three orders of magnitude, reflecting the effects of stellar mass and evolution on dilution.

40|$|A {{growing number}} of solar-like {{oscillations}} has been detected in red <b>giant</b> <b>stars</b> thanks to CoRoT and Kepler space-crafts. The seismic data gathered by CoRoT on red <b>giant</b> <b>stars</b> allow us to test mode driving theory in physical conditions different from main-sequence stars. Using a set of 3 D hydrodynamical models representative of the upper layers of sub- and red <b>giant</b> <b>stars,</b> we computed the acoustic mode energy supply rate (Pmax). Assuming adiabatic pulsations and using global stellar models that assume that the surface stratification comes from the 3 D hydrodynamical models, we computed the mode amplitude in terms of surface velocity. This was converted into intensity fluctuations using either a simplified adiabatic scaling relation or a non-adiabatic one. From L and M (the luminosity and mass), the energy supply rate Pmax is found to scale as (L/M) ^ 2. 6 for both main-sequence and red <b>giant</b> <b>stars,</b> extending previous results. The theoretical amplitudes in velocity under-estimate the Doppler velocity measurements obtained {{so far from the}} ground for red <b>giant</b> <b>stars</b> by about 30 %. In terms of intensity, the theoretical scaling law based on the adiabatic intensity-velocity scaling relation results in an under-estimation by a factor of about 2. 5 with respect to the CoRoT seismic measurements. On the other hand, using the non-adiabatic intensity-velocity relation significantly reduces the discrepancy with the CoRoT data. The theoretical amplitudes remain 40 % below, however, the CoRoT measurements. Our results show that scaling relations of mode amplitudes cannot be simply extended from main-sequence to red <b>giant</b> <b>stars</b> in terms of intensity on the basis of adiabatic relations because non-adiabatic effects for red <b>giant</b> <b>stars</b> are important and cannot be neglected.
