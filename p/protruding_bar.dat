50|$|The {{decline in}} {{popularity}} of convertibles in the US was partly caused by concern about lack of protection in rollover accidents, because most convertibles have no protection beyond the windshield frame. Some convertibles provide rollover protection using two <b>protruding</b> curved <b>bars</b> behind the headrests. Some Mercedes-Benz convertibles have a retractable roll bar which deploys {{in case of}} an accident. Race cars almost always have roll cages, since racing is very likely to result in a rollover. In addition, the roll cage's chassis-stiffening effect is usually seen as a benefit to the car.|$|R

50|$|Another {{interesting}} reversal {{effect was}} observed in 1928 by Verhoeff in which the red bars were perceived as farther away and the blue <b>bars</b> as <b>protruding</b> when the <b>bars</b> are paired on a white background instead of a black background. Verhoeff proposed that this paradoxical reversal can {{be understood in terms}} of the pupil's luminance contours (see: Illusory Contours). The pupil has lines of constant luminance efficiency, with each subsequent line marking a 25% decrease in efficiency. Around 1998, Winn and co-workers confirmed Verhoeff's interpretation of this reversal using experiments on different colored backgrounds. Other research has also suggested that border contrast changes could lead to color depth reversal with the switch from black to white backgrounds.|$|R

50|$|When {{a column}} {{is too long}} to be built or transported in one piece, {{it has to be}} {{extended}} or spliced at the construction site. A reinforced concrete column is extended by having the steel reinforcing <b>bars</b> <b>protrude</b> a few inches or feet above the top of the concrete, then placing the next level of reinforcing bars to overlap, and pouring the concrete of the next level. A steel column is extended by welding or bolting splice plates on the flanges and webs or walls of the columns to provide a few inches or feet of load transfer from the upper to the lower column section. A timber column is usually extended by the use of a steel tube or wrapped-around sheet-metal plate bolted onto the two connecting timber sections.|$|R

30|$|To {{verify the}} {{validity}} of the proposed model, it is necessary to compare the obtained results with those already published in the literature. Experimental data that have been elaborated by Wu and Gilbert (2009) are chosen. In this case, the applied load versus average axial strain curve is shown in Figure  2. Wu and Gilbert have tested several reinforced concrete prisms submitted to an axial tension having a square cross-section of 100 [*]×[*] 100  mm and 1, 100  mm of long and containing a single reinforcing bar longitudinally running through the centroid of each cross-section. Material properties and dimensions of specimens are regrouped in Tables 1 and 2.

Four of the specimens were tested under monotonically increasing deformation until yielding of the reinforcing steel bar (the short-term tests) (Wu and Gilbert 2009).|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} the firing of biomass at {{existing}} or new power plants has been widely adopted {{as one of the}} main technologies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from power generation. The particle size distribution of pneumatically conveyed biomass correlates closely with combustion efficiency and pollutant emissions and should therefore be monitored continuously. In this paper, an instrumentation system based on a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) piezoelectric film sensor is proposed, to achieve on-line continuous measurement of biomass particle size distribution. The sensor is attached to an impact <b>bar</b> <b>protruding</b> into the biomass particle flow. The relationship between the resulting impact signals and particle size is modelled mathematically, allowing particle size distribution to be inferred. Experimental work, undertaken with willow chips and miscanthus chips, has allowed both the effectiveness of the on-line particle sizing system and the validity of the mathematical model to be evaluated. The results indicate that the system has good linearity and repeatability. ...|$|R

30|$|Positioning {{of the six}} {{reinforcement}} bars and the centre cathode bar {{was done with the}} help of a wooden base, where bars were slotted in pre-drilled holes. The specimens were cast in the inverted position such that each <b>bar</b> <b>protruded</b> out of one end of the specimen by 15  mm when in the upright position. The protrusions of the bars were meant to allow connection of the electric circuit from the power supply to the specimens. After the main bars were put in place, spiral reinforcements were then tied to the main bars. Subsequently, epoxy coating was applied to both ends of the region of each specimen to prevent corrosion to these regions. Spacer blocks were also put along the spiral reinforcements to ensure required concrete cover. Large pipes of 208  mm diameter were also cut which formed the moulds of the specimens. A slit was made along the longitudinal direction of each pipe to facilitate the removal of the formwork upon demoulding. The slit was then closed by tying wires around the pipe. After that, the pipes were placed onto the wooden base and sealed along the circumference using silicone. Silicone was also applied along the slit to close up the gap.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTIn recent practices, a half {{circular}} prismatic <b>bar</b> <b>protruding</b> {{beyond the}} concave {{surface of the}} horn facing the gap has been formed along the centerplane of a rudder to lessen the gap flow between the horn and the movable portion of the rudder system. If a flow through the gap of a rudder is reduced considerably through this approach, previous numerical studies indicate that not only the gap flow but also the rudder cavitation can be noticeably diminished. In the present study, numerical simulations on two-dimensional rudder sections were performed {{to show that the}} blocking ability of the single centre bar can be improved by the proper choice of sectional shape. Moreover, a pair of blocking bars attached symmetric to the centerplane on the opposite convex surface of the movable portion is suggested in the study as well, to circumvent the difficulties arising from the practical application of the single centre bars. The bars are placed near the outer edges of the gap easily accessible at the maximum rudder angle to allow simple installation of the device during a maintenance period of a ship. It is found that the pair of blocking bars further improves the blocking effects and application to a practical three-dimensional rudder also backs up the fact...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} an {{experimental}} campaign concerning full-scale tests on precast reinforced concrete column-to-column connections made with grouted sleeve splices are presented. The precast column units had a square cross-section with the side of 500 mm. Eight 20 mm-diameter <b>bars</b> <b>protruding</b> from one unit were grouted into corrugated steel sleeves encased in the other unit. The column-to-column connections were subjected to four monotonic tests (axial tension, bending with and without axial compression, and shear) and to one cyclic bending test. In the tension test failure took place far from the interface between the precast units and highlighted {{the effectiveness of the}} stress transfer along the splice region. In all other tests, damage developed at the interface between the two units. In the bending tests with and without axial compression significant over-strengths with respect to design resistances computed for equally-reinforced monolithic members were attained. Because of the reduced thickness of the interface between the precast units, the rotation that concentrated at the interface led to a moderate reduction of the global bending stiffness. In the shear test the pure shear capacity of the bars crossing the joint was achieved. The cyclic bending test showed a ductile and stable hysteretic behavior of the connection...|$|R
40|$|Laing O’Rourke (LOR) have {{developed}} and patented a novel form of connection between precast concrete panels utilising lapped headed bars, {{known as the}} “E 6 joint”. Headed reinforcement <b>bars</b> <b>protrude</b> from adjacent faces of precast lightweight concrete panels, such that a reduced lap length {{can be used in}} the cast-in-situ joint region, thereby decreasing the joint width, when compared to straight bar lap splices. Confining reinforcement in the form of vertical shear studs and transverse bars is also installed in the joint. The aim of this research, funded by LOR, is to study the mechanical behaviour of this novel form of connection, at the serviceability and ultimate limit states, by means of numerical analysis, experimental testing and reliability analysis. The experimental results are used to validate a three dimensional non-linear finite element (NLFEA) model of the joint. A strut-and-tie model (STM) developed by LOR and reviewed by Arup, is used to determine the E 6 design joint strength. Analysis shows that the STM gives conservative results compared with numerical and experimental results whilst not fully capturing the observed joint behaviour. More refined alternative design approaches will be considered to overcome these shortcomings. Improved understanding of joint behaviour will enable the joint design to be optimised and facilitate the development of an improved simplified design method. Furthermore, a more widespread use of this system would lead to improvements in buildability, sustainability and health and safety in construction of concrete structures...|$|R

Shortly after one of the coolies rushed back, so frightened he could hardly articulate, and reported that a party of mounted Hung-hutzes had swooped down on the Sikhs, who had carelessly neglected to take their arms, and had carried them off and stolen their ponies.
