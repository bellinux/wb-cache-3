5|$|Marsupials such as opossums and {{the common}} brushtail possum have also {{developed}} noticeable sublingua with a <b>plica</b> mediana and a less specialized, but conspicuous, <b>plica</b> fimbriata.|$|E
5|$|A rigid {{structure}} {{called the}} <b>plica</b> mediana or lytta {{runs from the}} front to the back, {{down the center of}} the sublingua to give it support. The <b>plica</b> mediana is usually made of cartilage and attaches the sublingua to the underside of the tongue. In lemuriforms, the sublingua mostly consists of two plicae fimbriatae (singular: <b>plica</b> fimbriata), which run along the sides of the <b>plica</b> mediana and end in comb-like serrated edges that are hardened with keratin. The plicae fimbriatae move freely over a limited range. The <b>plica</b> sublingualis, which is found in all primates, but is particularly small in lemuriforms, attaches the tongue and sublingua to the floor of the mouth. Tarsiers have a large but highly generalized sublingua, but their closest living relatives, monkeys and apes, lack one.|$|E
5|$|Only the {{serrated}} {{and often}} keratinized {{tip of the}} sublingua is free to move small distances along {{the underside of the}} tongue, while the majority of its length adheres to the underside of the tongue. These free-moving folds or filaments are called the <b>plica</b> fimbriata and attach {{to the base of the}} sublingua and are supported at the midline by the <b>plica</b> mediana. The <b>plica</b> fimbriata is highly developed and specialized in lemurs, and makes up the majority of the sublingua.|$|E
40|$|Synovial <b>plicae</b> {{are normal}} {{anatomical}} {{structures of the}} knee that may become symptomatic. MRI is an established technique for evaluating the anatomy of the knee, {{and it is a}} valuable tool for detecting <b>plicae</b> because of its high resolution resulting in increased tissue characterisation. At MRI, knee <b>plicae</b> appear as low-signal-intensity structures of variable size and thickness, and they are better visualised at fluid-sensitive sequences with or without fat suppression. The combined use of clinical examination and MRI may also facilitate the diagnosis of fibrotic or inflamed <b>plicae</b> that may be symptomatic. Arthroscopy remains the gold standard for recognition and repair of knee <b>plicae</b> in cases of knee dysfunction...|$|R
40|$|VON LINDEN (1895 - 96) {{makes the}} prononncement {{that the first}} cliffereiitiation of the surface of gastropods-beginning in pre-Cambrian time as smooth shells-was the {{modification}} of the growth lines. Such a modification would be the devel-opment of longitudinal ribs technically spoken of as <b>plicae.</b> Whe~i <b>plicae</b> arc present, they ordinarily appear early in shell growth, and frequently they persist after the disappearance of other sculpture. On these two counts, orthodox assump-tion ~ ~ o u l c l grant <b>plicae</b> the standing of a primitive character. Graban (1907; 1912) has shown that scnlpture in several groups of the Gastropoda begins after a smooth embryonic stage, and that where <b>plicae</b> and revolving spirals both occur on the sanie shell the <b>plicae</b> are {{in advance of the}} spirals. Further, the sculpture is plicate in instances of acceleration wherein sculpture has advanced into the nuclear whorls...|$|R

5|$|Down {{the middle}} of the sublingua is a thick {{strengthening}} rod called the <b>plica</b> mediana or lytta, which connects the sublingua to the underside of the tongue, and is part of the lingual septum (septum of the tongue). The thickness and size of the <b>plica</b> mediana can vary between species, and except in treeshrews, it is cartilaginous and provides support for the sublingua.|$|E
5|$|In tarsiers, the sublingua {{does not}} have {{serrations}} along its tip and is much simpler and generalized in structure, making it clearly distinguishable {{from that of the}} lemuriform primates. The tarsier has a distinct <b>plica</b> mediana and its plicae fimbriatae are large and stick to the entire underside of the tongue. The <b>plica</b> sublingualis is also prominent.|$|E
5|$|The fold {{that connects}} {{the back of the}} sublingua and tongue to the rear floor of the mouth is called the <b>plica</b> sublingualis. In lemurs, this is an {{underdeveloped}} structure consisting of only a tiny outgrowth {{on the floor of the}} mouth. The point where the <b>plica</b> sublingualis attaches to the rear floor of the mouth marks the location of the submandibular salivary glands.|$|E
50|$|The Plectopylidae {{differ from}} the Corillidae by the {{presence}} of one or two vertical (= perpendicular to the suture) lamellae on the parietal wall, approximately a quarter to a half whorl behind the aperture. In contrast, the Corillidae have only horizontal (= parallel with the suture) parietal <b>plicae</b> (in Corilla all <b>plicae</b> may be absent).|$|R
50|$|Most {{species have}} massive shells {{with three or}} four {{prominent}} columellar <b>plicae.</b>|$|R
50|$|Rugae {{are only}} evident when an organ or tissue is {{deflated}} or relaxed. For example, rugae are evident within the stomach {{when it is}} deflated. However, when the stomach distends, the rugae unfold {{to allow for the}} increase in volume. On the other hand, <b>plicae</b> remain folded regardless of distension as is evident within the <b>plicae</b> of the small intestine walls.|$|R
5|$|The sublingua in lemuriform {{primates}} {{is fully}} developed and particularly unique. Tarsiers, which are most {{closely related to}} monkeys and apes (collectively called simians), also have a well-developed but non-specialized sublingua. Simians, however, {{do not have a}} sublingua, although some, such as titis have a highly specialized frenal lamella (<b>plica</b> sublingualis). All primates have a <b>plica</b> sublingualis, and the fimbria linguae (<b>plica</b> fimbriata) found under the tongue of apes may be a vestigial version, although that is still disputed. The structure and appearance of the sublingua, frenal lamella, lingual frenulum, and other sublingual tissue vary greatly between primates, and as a result, their terminology is often confused.|$|E
5|$|In the aye-aye, the sublingua is not {{shaped like}} a brush like it is in most lemurs. Instead, there is a {{thickened}} area along the <b>plica</b> mediana or lytta which has a hook-shaped structure on the end. Within cheirogaleids, the sublingua lacks cartilage, and the sublingua of the gray mouse lemur has a distinct <b>plica</b> mediana and ends in two lobe-like projections that lack keratinized serrations, but have three keratinized ridges which make the sublingua rigid.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{also have}} a third eyelid known as a nictitating membrane, whereas most other {{primates}} have a lesser developed <b>plica</b> semilunaris. The nictitating membrane keeps the cornea moist and clean by sweeping across the eye.|$|E
50|$|The jejunum {{contains}} {{very few}} Brunner's glands (found in the duodenum) or Peyer's patches (found in the ileum). However, {{there are a}} few jejunal lymph nodes suspended in its mesentery. The jejunum has many large circular folds in its submucosa called <b>plicae</b> circulares which increase the surface area for nutrient absorption. The <b>plicae</b> circulares are the best developed in the jejunum.|$|R

5|$|Most {{veins and}} crossveins {{occur in the}} {{anterior}} area of the remigium, {{which is responsible for}} most of the flight, powered by the thoracic muscles. The posterior portion of the remigium is sometimes called the clavus; the two other posterior fields are the anal and jugal ares. When the vannal fold has the usual position anterior to the group of anal veins, the remigium contains the costal, subcostal, radial, medial, cubital, and postcubital veins. In the flexed wing the remigiumturns posteriorly on the flexible basal connection of the radius with the second axillary, and the base of the mediocubital field is folded medially on the axillary region along the <b>plica</b> basalis (bf) between the median plates (m, m') of the wing base.|$|E
5|$|The {{axillary}} {{region is}} region containing the axillary sclerites has {{in general the}} form of a scalene triangle. The base of the triangle (a-b) is the hinge of the wing with the body; the apex (c) is the distal end of the third axillary sclerite; the longer side is anterior to the apex. The point d on the anterior side of the triangle marks the articulation of the radial vein with the second axillary sclerite. The line between d and c is the <b>plica</b> basalis (bf), or fold of the wing {{at the base of the}} mediocubital field.|$|E
5|$|Up to 60 {{helminth}} {{species are}} known to infect foxes in fur farms, while 20 are known in the wild. Several coccidian species of the genera Isospora and Eimeria are also known to infect them. The most common nematode species found in fox guts are Toxocara canis and Uncinaria stenocephala, Capillaria aerophila and Crenosoma vulpis, the latter two infect their lungs. Capillaria <b>plica</b> infect the fox's bladder. Trichinella spiralis rarely affects them. The most common tapeworm species in foxes are Taenia spiralis and T.pisiformis. Others include Echinococcus granulosus and E.multilocularis. Eleven trematode species infect red foxes, including Metorchis conjunctus.|$|E

40|$|A {{new species}} of the Plectopylidae, Gudeodiscus longiplica is {{described}} from northern Guangxi Province, southern China. The shell, anatomical and radular characters are figured and described. This new species is characterized by long <b>plicae</b> on its parietal shell wall, which have not been observed in any other Gudeodiscus species. In contrast, the long parietal <b>plicae</b> are characteristic for the genera Plectopylis and Chersaecia, which mainly inhabit Thailand and Myanmar. These two genera are, however, only distantly related to the new species, as other characters (anatomy, protoconch sculpture, parietal <b>plicae)</b> suggest. The male portion of the genital structure of the new species is characterized by two separate penial caeca with different lengths, but similar in outer and inner structure. The relevance of this anatomical character is discussed. Gudeodiscus longiplica sp. n. occurs sympatrically with Gudeodiscus soosi Páll-Gergely, 2013.
