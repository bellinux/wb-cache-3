50|$|On December 3, 2005, the US {{was blamed}} for another incident, in which alleged al-Qaeda #3 man (operations chief Abu Hamza Rabia) was {{reportedly}} killed in Pakistan by an airborne missile, together with four associates. However, Pakistani officials claim {{the group was}} killed while <b>preparing</b> <b>explosives,</b> not from any targeted military operation., The US has made no official comment about the incident.|$|R
5000|$|Terrorist {{activities}} have persisted from 2004 {{to the present}} day. In 2004 there was an unsuccessful shooting attack on a US Marine visiting the Saudi American Bank and an attempt to simultaneously explode car bombs at Saudi American Bank and Saudi British Bank branches in Jeddah {{on the anniversary of}} the 2001 [...] "9-11" [...] terrorist attacks on the U.S. On 26 August 2012, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry announced that terrorists were arrested in Jeddah who had been <b>preparing</b> <b>explosives</b> for attacks within the kingdom.|$|R

He was wanted in Lebanon for 200 cases of murder, assassinations, attempted assassinations and explosive attacks. [...] On 9 July, Al Jazeera reported that the Free Syrian Army recaptured the town hall, which had served as the main command center for Syrian troops in the area, and demolished {{it in order to}} prevent the Syrian government from recapturing it. [...] It was then reported that the Free Syrian Army controlled all of the town except for a few checkpoints and the city's main hospital.|$|R

50|$|In August 2016, Israel's {{security}} service, the Shin Bet, {{reported that}} it had arrested nine Palestinians who had been recruited by the Lebanon-based Hezbollah terrorist organization. Operatives of Hezbollah in Lebanon and Gaza Strip recruited residents of the West Bank, Gaza and Israel through Facebook and other social media sites. After recruiting cell leaders on Facebook, Hezbollah and the recruits used encrypted communications to avoid detection, and the leaders continued to recruit other members. The terror cells received Hezbollah funding and planned to conduct suicide bombings and ambushes and had begun <b>preparing</b> <b>explosive</b> devices for attacks, said the security service, which claimed credit for preventing the attacks. The Shin Bet said it also detected multiple attempts by Hezbollah to recruit Israeli Arabs through a Facebook profile.|$|R
5000|$|Iraultza (Basque for Revolution) {{was a small}} Basque militant {{armed group}} of leftist tendency. Seven of its own members died <b>preparing</b> <b>explosive</b> devices. On June 27, 1986, a bomb claimed by Iraultza mangled a young worker called José Miguel Moros Peña in Portugalete. The victim {{eventually}} died in Cruces Hospital (Barakaldo) on August 13, 1986. The group is also known for being described by the United States Government as [...] "probably having committed more bombings against American business interests than any other European terrorist group". Soon after, the group, which had been active for about a decade with small attacks of explosives that never aimed to cause any personal injuries, announced its dissolution. When the group was operational, {{it is estimated that}} it had approximately 20 members.|$|R
50|$|The {{boiler house}} was a steel framed {{building}} with the boilers suspended from the superstructure and above ground level to allow for their expansion.

50|$|Jewish, Kabos was interned for {{at least}} five months in a forced labor camp during World War II, He was called up in June 1944 to serve as a forced {{labourer}} in labour camps for Jews to the village of Felsöhangony, where he was teaching some army officers the use of sabre fencing. Later he was transferred to Budapest and was given two horses and a cart to transport food and provisions for others in camp. On 4 November, he was on Margaret Bridge (Margit-hid) while German soldiers were <b>preparing</b> <b>explosives</b> to blow up the bridge prior to it being used by the advancing Red Army which at that time was about 150 kilometers to the East of Budapest. Kabos died with many others and only some non-identifiable skeleton parts were found in 2011, when the bridge was being extended.|$|R
60|$|Out of her hearing {{there was}} a view largely entertained {{that he was a}} {{criminal}} trying to escape from justice by wrapping himself up so as to conceal himself altogether from the eye of the police. This idea sprang from the brain of Mr. Teddy Henfrey. No crime of any magnitude dating from the middle or end of February was known to have occurred. Elaborated in the imagination of Mr. Gould, the probationary assistant in the National School, this theory took the form that the stranger was an Anarchist in disguise, <b>preparing</b> <b>explosives,</b> and he resolved to undertake such detective operations as his time permitted. These consisted for the most part in looking very hard at the stranger whenever they met, or in asking people who had never seen the stranger, leading questions about him. But he detected nothing.|$|R
50|$|He was {{the subject}} of an FBI {{investigation}} through January 1993, at which point the investigation was called off, shortly before the World Trade Center bombing. On February 26, 1993, the day of the WTC bombing, he was seen by several witnesses with Mohammed A. Salameh at the Jersey City storage facility allegedly used to <b>prepare</b> the <b>explosives.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many of the Marines of Task Force X-Ray {{had little}} or no urban combat experience, and the US troops were not trained for urban close-quarters combat, so this battle was {{especially}} tough for them. Due to Huế's religious and cultural status, Allied forces were ordered not to bomb or shell the city, for fear of destroying the historic structures. Also, since it was still monsoon season in that area of the country with heavy rain and low clouds on many days during the battle, it was virtually impossible for the U.S. forces to use air support. But as the intensity of the battle increased, the policy was eliminated. The communist forces were constantly using snipers, hidden inside buildings or in spider holes, and prepared makeshift machine gun bunkers. They organized local counterattacks and, during the night, they <b>prepared</b> <b>explosive</b> booby traps. Sometimes booby traps were even placed under dead bodies.|$|R
50|$|Though Natalie {{is excited}} at the {{prospect}} of being the first to publish that sensational find, Emmet is substantially more pragmatic and chooses the commercial rewards made possible by the longevity potential evidenced by the reformed alien. Drawing the remaining two members of the team on his side, he stages a coup, holding Natalie, Curtis and the reformed alien at gunpoint and <b>preparing</b> <b>explosive</b> charges to seal off the tomb until he can return with a science team to reap his reward. Shielded from view by his benefactors, the alien quietly creates a spear by attaching a flint spearhead to a hollow metal pole the team had brought into the chamber. Using the weapon to defend the three of them, the alien thwarts the coup, but Natalie is critically wounded when Emmet looses a stray shot. Dean panickedly fires a gun at the creature, but a bullet hits and sets off the charges, collapsing the entrance and killing the perpetrators.|$|R
5000|$|In 1941, {{after the}} Axis {{attack on the}} Soviet Union, Panet {{received}} the task from the Romanian Communist Party to <b>prepare</b> <b>explosive</b> material for use in sabotage actions against German troops stationed in Romania. He organized a laboratory in the bathroom of his house in Bucharest. In October, he was arrested along with his wife, Lili, by the Siguranţa Statului (Romania's secret police) and all explosives were confiscated. On November 5, 1941, the couple {{was brought to the}} Jilava prison. The next day, after a two-hour-long summary trial by the Court Martial of the Military Command of Bucharest, the Panets were sentenced to death for membership in the Communist Party and for [...] "subversive activity against the security of the state". On November 7, they were executed by a firing squad in a forest near Jilava. According to a sergeant who participated in the execution, quoted by Vasile Vaida (a cellmate), Francisc Panet began to sing [...] "The Internationale" [...] before being shot.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the parade}} of the Zünfte (guilds), {{the climax of the}} holiday is the burning of Winter in effigy, {{in the form of the}} Böögg, a figure of a snowman <b>prepared</b> with <b>explosives.</b> The custom of burning a rag doll called Böögg predates the Sechseläuten. A Böögg (cognate to bogey) was {{originally}} a masked character doing mischief and frightening children during the carnival season.|$|R
50|$|According to Dekkushev's {{confession}} he, {{together with}} Krymshamkhalov and Batchayev, <b>prepared</b> the <b>explosives,</b> transported them to Volgodonsk, and randomly picked {{the apartment building}} on Octyabrskoye Shosse to blow up. Abu Omar had promised to pay him for the job, but Dekkushev never got a single kopeck. According to Dekkushev, it wasn't the FSB that ordered the bombing, as Boris Berezovsky later claimed, but the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).|$|R
5000|$|The {{largest of}} the mines at Messines was at St Eloi, dug by the 1st Canadian Tunnelling Company, {{consisting}} of 95600 lb of explosive. This allowed the capture of St Eloi by the British 41st Division. Another large mine was at Spanbroekmolen. Found and counter-mined by the Germans {{a few weeks before}} the attack, the British were forced to dig a second entrance tunnel into the already <b>prepared</b> <b>explosive</b> chamber, (which consisted of 41 tons of ammonal explosive 88 ft below ground), to reconnect the detonation wires. Although tested fully just a few hours before the attack, officers used torch batteries to prove the circuits. As instructed, soldiers of the 36th (Ulster) Division had already left their trenches and begun to move across No-Man's Land when the mine exploded a few seconds late, leading to some being killed by falling debris. They are buried in Lone Tree Cemetery nearby. The [...] "Lone Tree Crater" [...] formed by the blast was approximately 250 ft in diameter, and 40 ft deep.|$|R
50|$|Outside, Doug {{kills the}} mutant Cyst (Gregory Nicotero) and {{continues}} to search for Catherine. After ordering Lizard to kill Catherine, Big Brain is mauled to death by Beast. Lizard takes a cleaver and prepares to kill Catherine, but finds that Ruby has taken her. Doug sees Ruby running through the hills with Catherine and follows her. At the trailer, Brenda and Bobby <b>prepare</b> an <b>explosive</b> trap, which destroys the trailer, apparently killing Papa Jupiter.|$|R
25|$|The {{attack was}} carried out using a white Renault van hired earlier on the same evening in Harold Hill, Havering by Khuram Butt. He had {{intended}} to hire a 7.5 ton truck, but was refused due to his failure to provide payment details. The attackers were armed with 12-inch (30cm) kitchen knives with ceramic blades, which they tied to their wrists with leather straps. They also <b>prepared</b> fake <b>explosive</b> belts by wrapping water bottles in grey tape.|$|R
50|$|The {{police arrested}} the two women. More than 50 improvised {{explosive}} devices were recovered. The police also seized large numbers of wrist watch dials, SIM cards and tools used to <b>prepare</b> improvised <b>explosive</b> devices. Micro SD cards containing propaganda songs, Taliban training videos were recovered. Fake Indian documents like elector's card and passport were found. Maps and half burnt books in Arabic too were recovered. The CID detonated the {{improvised explosive devices}} {{on the banks of}} Damodar.|$|R
50|$|Two {{days after}} the attack, in a joint {{operation}} {{carried out by the}} Shin Bet, the Israeli police, and the IDF, Muhammad Mafarji, 18, of Tayibe, a West Bank-born Palestinian originally from Beit Liqya who had received Israeli citizenship for family reunification purposes, was arrested. Mafarji confessed to carrying out the attack and to having <b>prepared</b> the <b>explosive</b> device, chosen the target of the attack, and purchased a mobile phone which he used to remotely activate the explosive device.|$|R
5|$|In 1995, Oklahoma City was {{the site}} {{of one of the most}} {{destructive}} acts of domestic terrorism in American history. The Oklahoma City bombing of April 19, 1995, in which Timothy McVeigh detonated a large, crude explosive device outside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, killed 168 people, including 19 children. For his crime, McVeigh was executed by the federal government on June 11, 2001. His accomplice, Terry Nichols, is serving life in prison without parole for helping plan the attack and <b>prepare</b> the <b>explosive.</b>|$|R
50|$|Around 48 {{hours after}} the attack, Internal Security Forces arrested eleven people, mostly Syrians, over the attack. It later {{announced}} the arrest of two other Syrian and Lebanese suspects. They were arrested in a Palestinian refugee camp located in Burj al-Barajneh and a flat in the capital's eastern district of Achrafieh, which had allegedly been used to <b>prepare</b> the <b>explosive</b> belts. The initial plan was apparently to send five suicide bombers {{to a hospital in}} the neighbourhood, but heavy security forced them to change the target to a densely populated area.|$|R
30|$|Our {{experiment}} {{uses the}} standard uniaxial loading system commonly employed in rock physics: a column-shaped rock specimen is sandwiched between two steel platens and the load is applied until the specimen undergoes the final brittle fracture. Fracture in the uniaxial test is always explosive, {{but when the}} apparatus and specimen are carefully <b>prepared,</b> such <b>explosive</b> fracture accompanies faulting planes in the specimen (Yanagidani et al., 1985), which is the key technical aspect in our study. Typical size of our specimen is 5 cm in diameter and 12 cm in height. Our experiments are conducted in the ambient atmosphere at room temperature and humidity.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} with the aim of investigating the effect of magnetic fields on the carbon diffusion in pure iron. The Fe/Fe- 0. 87 mass% C diffusion couples <b>prepared</b> by <b>explosive</b> welding were annealed at temperatures from 850 to 1200 K without and with a uniform magnetic field up to 6 T and with a magnetic-field gradient of 45 T/m. We evaluated the carbon diffusivity in iron from the penetration profiles of carbon into iron measured by secondary ionization mass spectroscopy. The diffusivity of carbon in α-Fe decreased under a magnetic field, while it increased by twice under a magnetic-field gradient...|$|R
5000|$|On November 17, 1999, Ressam and Dahoumane {{traveled}} from Montreal, Quebec to Vancouver, British Columbia.
