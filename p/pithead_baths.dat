5|$|Much {{like many}} architects of his generation, {{following}} the British victory Hollamby pursued {{a career in}} local authority offices. He first worked as an architect for the Miners' Welfare Commission from 1947 to 1949, in this position designing <b>pithead</b> <b>baths</b> and a colliery extension at Lofthouse, Yorkshire. After gaining further qualifications from the Royal Institute of British Architects, he proceeded with a three-year evening course in town planning, run by William Holford and Arthur Ling at the Bartlett School of Architecture, London.|$|E
50|$|The {{colliery}} {{became part}} of Manchester Collieries in 1929 and the National Coal Board in 1947. In 1954, 1000 men were employed producing 440,000 tons of coal per annum. After closure most colliery buildings were demolished and the site landscaped. The <b>pithead</b> <b>bath</b> house built by the Miner's Welfare Committee in the 1930s survived and was converted to other uses. The pit {{was the subject of}} a painting by local artist, Roger Hampson.|$|R
5|$|Women {{were not}} {{explicitly}} banned from voting in Great Britain until the 1832 Reform Act and the 1835 Municipal Corporations Act. In England the suffrage movement existed {{before and after}} the 1832 act, but did not form a national organisation until the creation of the National Society for Women's Suffrage in 1872. Although there were notable exceptions such as the working-class areas of Lancashire, the women's suffrage movement in England was predominantly a middle-class movement. In Wales there were only two narrow bands of wealthy society in the Anglicised north and south coastal areas. Much of the female population of an emerging 19th century Wales was based in the low-waged, densely-populated, industrialised valleys of the south. At first women found work in metalworking and coal extraction, but then faced mass unemployment after the 1842 Mines and Collieries Act had prohibited them from working underground. The coal mining industry, with its absence of <b>pithead</b> <b>baths,</b> led to unpaid women's employment as the need to keep both their homes and the family's menfolk clean became a never ending task. This led to the image of the stoic Welsh Mam, a matriarch of the home, but little {{could be further from the}} truth in a society controlled by men.|$|E
25|$|Within a {{few years}} of nationalisation, a number of {{progressive}} measures had been carried out which did much to improve conditions in the mines, including better pay, a five-day working week, a national safety scheme (with proper standards at all the collieries), a ban on boys under the age of 16 going underground, the introduction of training for newcomers before going down to the coalface, and the making of <b>pithead</b> <b>baths</b> into a standard facility.|$|E
25|$|Work was {{commenced}} at Tilmanstone in 1906. An {{accident in}} 1909 killed {{three men and}} destroyed the pumping system, causing the mine to flood and work was abandoned for nine months. The site {{was connected to the}} East Kent Light Railway in 1912 and coal first brought to the surface in March 1913. An accident at the pit on 27 February 1931 resulted in Sydney William Padfield being awarded a bronze Edward Medal, the only one awarded in the Kent Coalfield. An aerial ropeway was built in 1930 to link the pit with Dover Harbour. This included tunnelling through the cliff at Dover to deliver the coal to a 5,000 ton bunker at the harbour. It wasn't used much after 1935, and was dismantled in 1954. In 1945, the workforce was 914, with 631 being employed sub-surface and 283 above. The colliery closed in 1986, having produced over 20,000,000 tons of coal. A system of tokens was used in the <b>pithead</b> <b>baths</b> and canteen and a lamp check was operated, in common with the majority of pits. All buildings have been demolished.|$|E

50|$|Mining was a {{dangerous}} industry but Manchester Collieries aimed to make the job as safe as possible, and training was a major priority. Some entrants attended local technical colleges and after 1942 some were sent to university. The company {{was considered to be}} a generous employer; workers at its pits were on average 1s 6d per shift better off than miners working for other employers, and it built <b>pithead</b> <b>baths</b> and canteens at its pits.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pithead</b> <b>baths</b> and an {{administration}} block were built around 1937 and surface buildings upgraded between 1943 and 1946.

In 1978 the colliery employed 230 men winning 4,000 tons of coal per week from the Beeston Seam. The coal reserves were exhausted by 1985 and the colliery closed. It reopened as the Yorkshire Mining Museum in 1988.|$|E

5000|$|The museum {{features}} {{a range of}} above ground attractions including a winding house, saw mill, <b>pithead,</b> <b>baths.</b> Visitors are also taken below ground to the pit bottom where they tour the mine workings. In 2000, the Blaenavon industrial area, including Big Pit National Coal Museum, was named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

50|$|The canteen {{was opened}} {{and at the}} same time a new fitting and {{electric}} shop replaced the old one under the Middle Pit Power House which had become inadequate. In 1938 a new boiler house containing twelve Lancashire boilers fuelled by pulverised coal and considered to be one of the best in Britain was brought into use. In the same year, the <b>Pithead</b> <b>Baths,</b> containing 3,817 ‘clean’ and 3,817 ‘dirty’ lockers was brought into use on Saturday, January 29th. The canteen was also opened in 1938.|$|E
50|$|During {{its peak}} period the {{colliery}} employed around 1500 people directly {{although most of}} the 6000-7000 village community relied upon the pit in one way or another. In 1935 the colliery was employing 142 men on the surface and 949 underground. In 1931, Lady Windsor was among the first collieries in Wales to provide a <b>pithead</b> <b>baths</b> and first aid/medical treatment room, with the residents of the village were also allowed to use the baths for a small fee (3d to 6d). In 1935 the colliery was employing 142 men on the surface and 949 underground.|$|E
50|$|In 1939, <b>pithead</b> <b>baths</b> were {{installed}} at the mine; it meant miners no longer needed to walk home dirty and wet, risking illness. The baths were also beneficial to miners' families; women no longer needed to carry hot jugs of water to fill tin baths and children were no longer accidentally scalded during this process. During the Second World War, surface extraction of coal began at Blaenavon in November 1941 using equipment and skilled men from the Canadian Army. On nationalisation in 1947, the National Coal Board took over the mine from the Blaenavon Co. Ltd, which employed 789 men.|$|E
5000|$|The headstocks and {{nineteenth century}} pithead {{buildings}} of the former Snibston Colliery form a prominent feature {{to the west of}} the town and in 2012, work commenced on a £1.4 million restoration scheme, the buildings having appeared on English Heritage's annual [...] "at risk" [...] register due to the state of the pithead structures, which had reached an advanced state of decay.The colliery was sunk in 1831 and closed in December 1983. The <b>Pithead</b> <b>Baths</b> on the north side of Ashby Road are by J W M Dudding and date from 1940. These have now been used to accommodate local business ventures.|$|E
5000|$|Lancashire {{was at the}} {{forefront}} of innovation in coal mining from James Brindley's 1756 water wheel at Wet Earth Colliery to the Duke of Bridgewaters's underground canals. Edward Ormerod patented a [...] "Butterfly" [...] safety link to improve cage safety in 1867 that is used globally. Lancashire had the first <b>pithead</b> <b>baths</b> in the country at Gibfield Colliery in Atherton and the first mines rescue station at to cover an entire coalfield at Howe Bridge in 1908. The Anderton Shearer Loader invented by James Anderton produced more than half the total output of British coal in the 1960s.|$|E
5000|$|On 1 January 1947, {{along with}} the rest of the coal industry, Bersham was nationalised and placed under the control of the National Coal Board. The {{colliery}} was immediately modernised, completed in 1954 with a new block housing new <b>pithead</b> <b>baths,</b> canteen and offices designed to cater for up to 1,100 men. The pit ponies at Bersham numbering near 100, which had been underground for most, if not all of their lives, were retired in the same year and replaced with mechanical traction. The colliery reached its largest size in 1958, with 1,011 recorded at the site.|$|E
5000|$|Caphouse Colliery was sunk in the 1770s or 1780s and the Hope Pit in the 1820s. Sir John Lister Lister Kaye of Denby Grange {{took over}} James Milnes' leases the mineral rights in 1827 and his pits became the Denby Grange Colliery. The boiler house and stone and brick chimney {{at the museum}} are Grade II listed {{structures}} built around 1876 for Emma Lister Kaye along with the steam winding engine house, boiler yard, heapstead and ventilation shaft which are Grade II* listed. The boiler house has two Lancashire boilers and powered the winding engine. The timber headgear at Caphouse and the wood framed screens building at Hope Pit date from between 1905 and 1911. <b>Pithead</b> <b>baths</b> and an administration block were built between 1937 and 1938.|$|E

In 1946, at the invitation of the Minister of Fuel and Power, Emmanuel Shinwell MP, he was invited to join the newly nationalized National Coal Board and given a welfare role for its then 700,000 or so miners (<b>pithead</b> <b>baths,</b> Summer Schools and machinery for joint consultation). He served for a year until Shinwell again recommended his appointment as Chairman of the British Electricity Authority (from 1955 the Central Electricity Authority),and in 1947, Prime Minister Attlee confirmed this ‘romance’ appointment for the former electrician. He served in this capacity for ten years (remaining on the Board until 1962 in a part-time capacity. In this role, he embarked on an entirely new career, hence the second volume of his memoirs title, Two Careers.|$|E
