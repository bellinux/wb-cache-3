500|$|Despite being morphologically identical, some {{specimens}} supposedly {{belonging to}} three species, namely [...] Amphidromus semitessellatus, A. xiengensis and A. areolatus, apparently had polyphyletic origins of mtDNA haplotypes. This {{resulted in the}} same species simultaneously appearing in distinct clades along the topology: for instance, A. areolatus {{can be found in}} two different clades in Sutcharit and colleague's (2007) cladogram, clustered respectively with A. xiengiensis and also with A. semitesselatus. According to the authors, these results could be explained by convergent and <b>polymorphic</b> <b>shell</b> color patterns (e.g., the shells of the specimens had very similar colors and shape, though the mtDNA markers showed significant differences). Alternatively, they could also be the result of introgressive hybridization or ancestral polymorphism of mtDNA. In any case, analyses of phylogeography using other markers (nuclear markers or other mtDNA markers) or additional morphological characters would still be necessary to further clarify these issues.|$|E

30|$|Perhaps, we must {{discuss this}} case {{in the context of}} phenotypical {{polymorphism}}. Many years ago, Diver ([1939]: 101) defined polymorphism in non-marine snails as a situation when a species ‘…contains two or more distinct forms in the same colony’. One must find a discontinuity in variation of shell character(s) to acclaim a species to be <b>polymorphic.</b> Typically, <b>shell</b> polymorphism of this kind is rarely demonstrated by lymnaeids despite their great intrapopulation variation in shell shape, size and ever texture (Diver [1939]; Hubendick [1951]). In the studied instance, we are dealing with polymorphism of another sort that may be called ‘statistical polymorphism’. It is characterized by statistically significant differences between mean values of all or some standard morphometric indices of syntopic morphs with parallel absence of phenotypical discontinuity (full hiatus) between them (see Table  2). The ‘typical’ individuals of each morphs may be visibly different (see Figure  1) but a portion of specimens in a mixed sample cannot be unambiguously ascribed to either of morphs due to the absence of hiatus.|$|R

We report here a novel genetic characterization of a prehistoric exchange network involving an endemic Pacific island tree snail, Partula hyalina. It occurs in the Society (Tahiti only), Austral and Southern Cook Islands. Our genetic data, based on museum, captive and wild-caught samples, establish Tahiti as the source island. The source lineage is <b>polymorphic</b> in <b>shell</b> coloration and contains a second nominal species, the dark-shelled Partula clara, in addition to the white-shelled P. hyalina. Prehistoric inter-island introductions were non-random: they involved white-shelled snails only and were exclusively inter-archipelago in scope. Partulid shells were commonly used in regional Polynesian jewellery, and we propose that the white-shelled P. hyalina, originally restricted to Tahiti, had aesthetic value throughout these archipelagoes. Demand within the Society Islands could be best met by trading dead shells, but a low rate of inter-archipelago exchange may have prompted the establishment of multiple founder populations in the Australs and Southern Cooks. The alien carnivorous land snail Euglandina rosea has recently devastated populations of all 61 endemic species of Society Island partulid snails. Southern Cooks and Australs P. hyalina now represent the only unscathed wild populations remaining of this once spectacular land snail radiation...|$|R

Besides those modal forms there are little frequent variants characterized by narrower shell with less rapidly expanding, regularly curved whorls directed forward.

40|$|Variation in the {{abundance}} {{and distribution of}} two species of mangrove littorinid was investigated using a nested sampling design at different spatial scales, in the two dominant seasons, in Hong Kong. The abundance of Littoraria melanostoma, which was less abundant than L. ardouiniana, showed large-scale spatial variation whilst abundance of L. ardouiniana varied on both large and smaller spatial scales and interacted with seasons, indicating that {{the abundance}} of this species varied between mangroves in summer and winter. Small-scale variation suggested a patchy distribution of littorinids within a mangrove, whilst the large-scale variation might reflect changes in physical factors possibly associated with habitat fragmentation. Investigation of the vertical distribution of the littorinids on the mangrove trees revealed that L. melanostoma were located at a lower overall level than L. ardouiniana. This zonation pattern may {{be a result of}} the morphological differences of the two species, as L. melanostoma has a thick shell, whilst L. ardouiniana has a thinner, but colour <b>polymorphic</b> <b>shell.</b> Both species of mangrove littorinid showed patchy distributions at a variety of scales and these patterns highlight the importance of using a hierarchical sampling approach when investigating spatially fragmented habitats. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{occurrence}} of Sarcophaga megafilosia and S. meiofilosia, two flies that are parasitoids of littorinid snails, along {{the east coast of}} Australia from Cooya, Queensland (16 ° 27 'S) to Settlement Point, New South Wales (31 ° 24 /S). Shells of attacked snails containing larvae and pupae of these parasitoids remain attached to the substratum by a dark ring of dried mucus that forms around the aperture, so the leaves and branches of mangroves, Avicennia marina, were searched for such shells, and flies that subsequently emerged were identified. The majority of snails attacked by S. megafilosia and S. meiofilosia were Littoraria filosa, but both flies emerged from L. luteola, and S. megafilosia also emerged from L. philippiana. The two parasitoids were found at the most northern site sampled and extended south to approximately 27 °S, beyond which L. filosa became uncommon. Littoraria filosa is strikingly <b>polymorphic</b> for <b>shell</b> colour. Since S. megajilosia selects for crypsis in L. filosa and was found at most sites sampled, we suggest {{it is likely to be}} important in maintaining this polymorphism. We also suggest the wider distribution of these parasitoids may be similar to that of L. filosa and thus extend both westwards and northwards into the Indo-Pacific below the equator, and that other sarcophagid parasitoids of littorinid snails may be found in the central Indo-Pacific...|$|R
40|$|Variation in ontogenetic {{development}} {{among individuals}} {{may be a}} major contributor to morphological variation within species. Evolution of different growth trajectories might, for example, evolve as a response to varying ecological contexts of individuals living in different environments, or by life-stage or gender differences. The intertidal periwinkle Littorina saxatilis is strongly <b>polymorphic</b> in <b>shell</b> shape. We compared ontogenetic trajectories between life stages, local populations, and sexes to understand how different morphological end points are reached during ontogeny and what might cause these differences. Applying landmark-based geometric morphometrics, we captured shell shape variation for four Swedish populations of this species. We also derived a method to visualize ontogenetic trajectories described by the relationship of size to the multivariate shape space. We found that growth trajectories differed between individuals living in different habitats, as well as between sexes and maturity stages. Males living on rocky cliffs grew isometrically throughout life, whereas females from the same habitat switched from isometric growth as juveniles to allometric growth as adults. In contrast, males and females living on boulders grew allometrically as juveniles but changed to isometric growth at sexual maturity. Thus, in this species, ontogenetic growth seems influenced by habitat-associated selection as well as by gender and age-specific selection. These differing selection regimes result in ontogenetic shifts in allometry in three of the four groups examined...|$|R

40|$|International audienceBecause {{of their}} highly <b>polymorphic</b> <b>shell</b> patterns, Cepaea land snails {{have been the}} subject of {{numerous}} studies in ecological genetics. Here, we investigated the spatial structure of polychromatism in Cepaea hortensis in agricultural landscapes with zones from low to high hedgerow densities. Our main purpose was to search for a relationship between landscape composition and spatial structuring of chromatism. Despite significant spatial heterogeneity in the three landscapes sampled, only the high hedgerow density landscape showed a significant spatial structuring of shell polymorphism. In order to understand this result, an investigation of daily movement patterns in relation to habitat form was carried out on a mark-release experiment under semiartificial conditions. This experiment revealed a strong influence of a linear corridor on snail dispersal. In the field, spatial heterogeneity of shell polymorphism, related to the effects of genetic drift, was shaped by restricted dispersal in narrow corridors. In the more enclosed one, i. e. where hedgerow density was the highest, the significant spatial structure we detected involved a balance between local genetic drift and environmentally mediated gene flow. This isolation by distance pattern resulted from direct gene exchange through fields between neighbouring populations. When applying landscape distances based on hedgerow length, no significant spatial correlation with polychromatism was found. In the more fragmented sites, random genetic drift seemed to be the prevailing force and, at the scale of the whole sampled area, selective pressures potentially interfere with these genetic drift-dispersal events...|$|E
40|$|Subject relevance. The {{process of}} mental {{pathology}} pathomorphosis {{leads to the}} polymorphism of its clinical manifestations and, as a consequence – to difficulties in identification and differential diagnosis. The {{solution to this problem}} is in the adaption of diagnostic methodology to clinical realities by including into their structure instruments formed basing on pathomorphosis factors and trends. In this perspective, the most prominent example is endogenous catatonia, which in the academic tradition is conventionally affiliated with the form of schizophrenia with the same name. According to the classical understanding, endogenous catatonia, or, in the narrow sense – catatonic syndrome, is a group of intermittent motor disorders, arranged with <b>polymorphic</b> <b>shell</b> constellation of neuropsychiatric manifestations. The aim is to develop pathomorphosis adapted clinical algorithm of endogenous catatonia differential diagnostics. Materials and methods: 236 patients of Zaporizhzhia Regional Psychiatric Clinic were examined. Patients were divided into groups due to their mental disorders: – core group: patients with elements of endogenous catatonia in the structure of different clinical forms of schizophrenia (there were 144 patients in this group); – comparison group # 1 : 69 patients with late neurotropic effects of neuroleptic therapy (LNENT); – comparison group # 2 : 103 patients with catatonia-morphic dissociative disorders (CDD); – comparison group # 3 : 90 patients with organic catatonic disorder (OrCD); Results. Using Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating scale as an instrument of clinical analysis and statistical research of results with A. Wald’s sequential analysis (modificated by E. V. Gubler) an algorithm of differential diagnostics of endogenus catatonia which includes 3 steps of Recognition Scale for Endogenous Catatonia is developed. Conclusion.

40|$|Many {{species of}} {{arboreal}} marine snails in the genus Littoraria are <b>polymorphic</b> for <b>shell</b> colour, with morphs that correspond in both colour and frequency to those predominant in the habitat. Although the combined effects of selection for crypsis and apostasy {{have been suggested}} as the most likely reasons for this, {{they have not been}} demonstrated directly in the field. We investigated whether two parasitoid flies, Sarcophaga megafilosia and Sarcophaga meiofilosia, select for crypsis in Littoraria filosa. It was possible to compare the proportions that matched and did not match the background between samples of live and dead snails because the shells of individuals killed by these parasitoids, within which the larva and pupa develop, remain attached to the substratum. This comparison was necessary because these snails frequently move among different coloured microhabitats, which will tend to obscure any effect of selection for crypsis if only live individuals are censused. The method appeared reliable since there was no change in background colour and very little loss of shells between larviposition and emergence of flies. S. megafilosia killed a significantly greater than expected proportion of snails that did not match their background. In contrast, {{there was no evidence of}} selective attack by S. meiofilosia. These results are discussed in relation to previous work on polymorphisms in Littoraria species. We also suggest that the role of parasitoid insects as selective agents contributing to the maintenance of colour polymorphisms in terrestrial molluscs may have been overlooked. © 2002 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2002, 77, 367 - 377...|$|R
40|$|Gastropods have {{an unusual}} genetic {{mechanism}} {{in which the}} mother's genotype determines the shell phenotype of her offspring. Experiments have shown that these unknown, maternal-effect genes determine shell chirality, the direction each snail shell coils, with dextral or right handed having a clockwise spiral, and sinistral or left handed having a counterclockwise spiral. Most snail species consist only of dextral individuals, while some species are entirely sinistral, and some species are <b>polymorphic</b> for <b>shell</b> chirality, producing both dextrals and sinistrals in the same species. This particular genetic mechanism implies a lack of homozygous-dominant (R/R) individuals in the alternative shell phenotype, while the primary phenotype can {{have any of the}} genotypes of homozygous dominant, heterozygous (R/r), or homozygous recessive (r/r) in snails. In humans, the hair-whorl rotation, the direction in which the hair spins {{at the back of the}} head, is generally either clockwise or counterclockwise and has been associated with handedness, cerebral laterality, and sexual orientation. As such, direction of hair-whorl rotation is thought to be a phenotypic marker underlying the genetics of various behavioral phenotypes in our species. Previous research has already associated handedness with sexual orientation, psychosis, and autism spectrum disorders (ASD), but to the best of my knowledge, hair-whorl rotation has not been tabulated in autistic individuals. A recent theory has proposed that maternal-effect genes are involved in determining handedness and hair-whorl rotation in humans, in addition to various behavioral phenotypes in our species. These genes (possibly RHD and RHCE) predict a lack of homozygous-dominant individuals among the alternative phenotypes in humans, analogous to shell chirality in snails. If maternal-effect genes are interacting with biparentally-expressed genes to cause some cases of ASD and other behaviora...|$|R
40|$|The marine snail, Littoraria filosa, is <b>polymorphic</b> for <b>shell</b> colour, with yellow, {{brown and}} pink morphs that {{correspond}} in both appearance and frequency to the predominant background colours of its habitat. Previous {{research on this}} polymorphism has found indirect evidence of apostatic selection and selection for crypsis by unknown agents, probably crabs, and direct evidence of selection for crypsis by the parasitoid fly Sarcophaga megafilosia. Here we report on field experiments to investigate whether (a) S. megafilosia and (b) shell crushing predators, exert apostatic selection on L. filosa. For S. megafilosia seven experimental treatments containing yellow and brown snails in the proportions of 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 5, 0. 6, 0. 8 and 0. 9 of each colour were established on mangrove trees and used to separately quantify the proportions of each colour attacked on grey/brown trunks and yellow/green leaves. Results confirmed an earlier finding of selection for crypsis, but only showed slight, but significant, anti-apostatic selection by S. megafilosia. For shell crushing predators, seven experimental treatments containing yellow and brown snails in the proportions of 0. 08, 0. 17, 0. 33, 0. 50, 0. 66, 0. 83 and 0. 92 were established on two types of trees that differed in their background proportions of brown and green: (a) trees which had been pruned of about 90 % of their foliage and (b) unpruned trees. Results showed both selection for crypsis and apostatic selection. Furthermore, a selectively neutral frequency for yellow L. filosa was found for each background, and was less on pruned trees than unpruned ones (and vice versa for brown L. filosa), which can therefore account {{for the maintenance of}} a colour polymorphism where the proportions of each morph tend to resemble and correspond in frequency to the colours of the background...|$|R
40|$|Pulmonate {{land snails}} are often <b>polymorphic</b> in their <b>shell</b> {{coloration}} pattern. To quantify {{the contribution of}} environmental parameters to the nondirectional change in phenotypic variation, we used a historic dataset on Theba pisana morph frequencies and climate data for statistical modelling. We found significant correlations {{of the degree of}} phenotypic diversity between juveniles and corresponding adult individuals within the same and the subsequent generation. Among climate parameters, the phenotypic diversity of adults correlated significantly and positively with the mean and maximum ambient temperatures in the winter and spring only. There was no correlation between high or low temperatures and the frequency of distinct morphs. Akaike's information criterion-based model selection revealed the particular importance of only parental phenotypic diversity for next generation juvenile phenotypic diversity. By contrast, phenotypic diversity of the juveniles of the preceding year and the mean temperatures in winter and spring were important for the phenotypic diversity of adult snails. Approximately two-thirds of the explicable variation in phenotypic diversity of adults was explained by inheritance and approximately one-third was expained by ambient temperature. The present study shows that genetics and temperature interact to generate nondirectional changes in phenotypic variation within populations, which also can be reflected by changes in the phenotype of individual...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1980 Thais (Nucella) emarginata is {{a common}} predatory {{gastropod}} of the rocky intertidal system of western North America. It is usually found at low tide on top of its sedentary prey, barnacles and mussels. Thais is also highly <b>polymorphic</b> for <b>shell</b> color, and breeding of isolated females {{has shown that the}} polymorphism has a genetic basis. This study of the Thais polymorphism is divided into two parts. In the first part, I describe the variation, its genetic basis, consider patterns of variation and change for ten Oregon populations, and assess micro- and macrohabitat relationships of the different morph types. The second part is a study of snail movement and its relationship to morph frequencies at one of the sites. Of the eight shell color categories examined at the Oregon sites, a solid colored Black morph and a striped Grey-Black morph are clearly the most common types. There were no consistent patterns of shell color frequency change associated with any environmental variable recorded. These included latitude, wave action, subtidal type (sand, gravel, or solid rock), relative abundance of any prey type, direction of facing (N, S, or W), Thais density, or Thais distribution. One pattern did emerge from this investigation. Six of the ten sites had significant shell color frequency change between 1978 and 1979, and three others had marginally significant change, indicating the polymorphism is a very dynamic one [...] There was a significant association between shell color and microhabitat type. However, Black and Grey-Black snails did not show such an association, and the causes of this relationship in the minor categories remains obscure. There were also a significant association between shell color and macrohabitat (reef versus cobble type habitats). A comparison of the frequencies of Black and Grey-Black snails at seven of the sites (those having both habitat types) exhibited a slight, but very consistent relationship between shell color and macrohabitat. I postulate that this relationship is due to a differential response to wave action in the two macrohabitat types. The study of movement was carried out at Cascade Head on the north central Oregon coast. Preliminary experiments with a marking method de signed to minimally disturb the animals suggested that movement was responsible for the high losses of tagged animals reported in the literature. Snails on a particular boulder at Cascade Head were painted with nail polish and their shell color frequencies were recorded. When a painted snail moved off that rock, it was given a numbered tag. Comparisons of the frequencies of painted snails, tagged snails, and overall frequencies of Black and Grey-Black snails in the population show a close concordance indicating that movement plays a role in the dynamics of shell color frequency change in the population. There was no association between probability of movement and shell color frequencies of those that moved and were tagged. Black and Grey- Black tagged snails were not different in size, nor was there any difference in mean distances moved. There was, however, {{a significant difference in the}} directions the two morphs moved, which when taken within the context of the geography of Cascade Head, predicts a net loss of Black snails from the population. There was, in fact, a significant negative regression of the frequencies of Black snails over time, consistent with the idea that movement is very important in the dynamics of the polymorphism. In the discussion of these results, voluntary versus involuntary movement is contrasted, and I note that Thais has the ability to find suitable habitat after a move. Differential directions of movement by the two morphs is postulated to be a response, as with the macrohabitat correlations, to wave action. I suggest that shell color, or genes closely linked to shell color loci, are causing the response in both cases. This movement study suggests that delineation of a population of Thais is a formidable task, and the question of what a biological population of Thais emarginata is remains obscure...|$|R
