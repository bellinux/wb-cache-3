Intuitively, compared with state 1, state 2 and 3 harbor a longer structure in the vertical direction. An amphipathic tunnel between <b>pore</b> <b>filter</b> region and PMD enlarges the cave pocket and contributes to the vertical extension (Fig.  4 C). This tunnel enlargement {{was due to the}} movement of the outer PMD and accompanied by a twist between VSD region and <b>pore</b> <b>filter</b> region. The main difference between state 2 and state 3 lies in the transmembrane filter region with a slight twist occurring in the helix S 5 and S 6 (Fig.  4 C).|$|E

The polyurethane foam filter is an in depth multiple <b>pore</b> <b>filter</b> of variable pore size. This filter allows many aggregates to escape through the pores {{in the beginning of}} a transfusion and these aggregates were seen in a Dacron wool filter downstream. As aggregates become trapped, the pore sizes decrease, filtration improves, and flow through the filter becomes reduced. The Dacron wool filter absorbs the particulate material to the fibers of wool. This filter has a large capacity and was not observed to leak aggregates even when subjected to high filtration pressures...|$|E

40|$|Stromal {{fibroblasts}} {{modify the}} initial recruitment of leucocytes by endothelial cells (EC), but {{their effects on}} subsequent transendothelial migration remain unclear. Here, EC and dermal or synovial fibroblasts were cultured on opposite surfaces of 3 -lm <b>pore</b> <b>filters</b> and incorporated in static or flow-based migration assays. Fibroblasts {{had little effect on}} tumour necrosis factor-a-induced transendothelial migration of neutrophils,but tended to increase the efficiency of migration away from the endothelium. Surprisingly, similar close contact between EC and fibroblasts strongly reduced lymphocyte migration in static assays, and nearly abolished stable lymphocyte adhesion from flow. Fibroblasts did not alter endothelial surface expression of adhesion molecules or messenger RNA for chemokines. Inhibition of attachment did not occur when EC-fibroblast contact was restricted by using 04 -lm <b>pore</b> <b>filters,</b> but under these conditions pre-treatment with heparinase partially inhibited adhesion. In the 3 -lm pore co-cultures, inhibition of metalloproteinase activity partially recovered lymphocyte adhesion, but addition of CXCL 12 (SDF- 1 a) to the endothelial surface did not. Hence, the ability of EC to present activating chemokines for lymphocytes may have been enzymatically inhibited by direct contact with fibroblasts. To avoid contact, we cultured EC and fibroblasts on separate 3 -lm <b>pore</b> <b>filters</b> one above the other. Here,fibroblasts promoted the transendothelial migration of lymphocytes. Fibroblasts generate CXCL 12, but blockade of CXCL 12 receptor had no effect on lymphocyte migration. While stromal cells can provide signal(s) promoting leucocyte migration away from the sub-endothelial space,direct cell contact (which might occur in damaged tissue) may cause disruption of chemokine signalling, specifically inhibiting lymphocyte rather than neutrophil recruitment...|$|R

A simple pumping efficiency test was conducted for all five pore diameters where it was observed that evacuation times were adversely affected by reducing the pore size below 5 {micro}m. Common test conditions for the zinc trapping efficiency experiments were used. These conditions resulted in some variability, to ascribe different efficiencies to the filter media. However, the data suggest that there is no significant difference in trapping efficiency for filter media with pores from 0. 2 to 20 {micro}m with a thickness of 0. 065 -inch. Consequently, the 20 {micro}m <b>pore</b> <b>filter</b> media that is currently used at SRS is a suitable filter material for to utilize for future extractions.

40|$|HCV NS 3 helicase {{exhibits}} activity toward DNA and RNA substrates. The DNA helicase {{activity of}} NS 3 {{has been proposed}} to be optimal when multiple NS 3 molecules are bound to the same substrate molecule. NS 3 catalyzes little or no measurable DNA unwinding under single cycle conditions in which the concentration of substrate exceeds the concentration of enzyme by 5 -fold. However, when NS 3 (100 nm) is equimolar with the substrate, a small burst amplitude of ∼ 8 nm is observed. The burst amplitude increases as the enzyme concentration increases, {{consistent with the idea}} that multiple molecules are needed for optimal unwinding. Protein-protein interactions may facilitate optimal activity, so the oligomeric properties of the enzyme were investigated. Chemical cross-linking indicates that full-length NS 3 forms higher order oligomers much more readily than the NS 3 helicase domain. Dynamic light scattering indicates that full-length NS 3 exists as an oligomer, whereas NS 3 helicase domain exists in a monomeric form in solution. Size exclusion chromatography also indicates that full-length NS 3 behaves as an oligomer in solution, whereas the NS 3 helicase domain behaves as a monomer. When NS 3 was passed through a small <b>pore</b> <b>filter</b> capable of removing protein aggregates, greater than 95 % of the protein and the DNA unwinding activity was removed from solution. In contrast, only ∼ 10 % of NS 3 helicase domain and ∼ 20 % of the associated DNA unwinding activity was removed from solution after passage through the small <b>pore</b> <b>filter.</b> The results indicate that the optimally active form of full-length NS 3 is part of an oligomeric species in vitro...|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of cell contacts in transfilter mouse kidney tubule induction by spinal cord was investigated.

There was an inverse correlation between pore size and minimum time of transfilter culture required for induction to occur. The differences in the diffusion rates through these filters do not support long range diffusion as a mechanism for induction. Electron microscopy of the cultures showed abundant cytoplasmic penetration deep into filters with 0 - 2 /tm or larger pores. Processes from mesenchymal and spinal cord cells were closely apposed within the filter channels. No extracellular matrix or membrane vesicles were seen between the processes. In a few instances shallow penetration was seen in 01 /tm type filters, but no contacts were observed.

50|$|Each subunit {{consists}} of two related halves oriented in opposite directions, forming an ‘antiparallel’ structure. These halves come together to form the anion pore.

The names of these binding sites correspond to their positions within the membrane. Sint is exposed to intracellular fluid, Scen lies inside the membrane or {{in the center of}} the filter, and Sext is exposed to extracellular fluid.4 Each binding site binds different chloride anions simultaneously. In the exchangers, these chloride ions do not interact strongly with one another, due to compensating interactions with the protein. In the channels, the protein does not shield chloride ions at one binding site from the neighboring negatively charged chlorides. Each negative charge exerts a repulsive force on the negative charges next to it.

The method {{is based on the}} lyophilization of double emulsions containing disaccharides as lyoprotectants in both the inner and outer aqueous phase. Using various phospholipids or mixtures of lipids as emulsifiers, the double emulsions can be prepared by a two-step emulsification, including hydrophilic agents in the inner aqueous phase or lipophilic agents in the oil phase. Then, the double emulsions are lyophilized after sterilization by passing them through a 0. 22 -μm <b>pore</b> <b>filter.</b> Rehydration of the lyophilized products results in liposomes with a relatively high encapsulation efficiency (for calcein, 87 %; 5 -fluorouracil, 19 %; flurbiprofen, 93 %) and a size below 200  nm measured by the dynamic light scattering technique (DLS) and the atomic force microscopy (AFM). The liposomes were found to be unilamellar from freeze-fracture electron micrographs and X-ray diffraction patterns. In addition, the liposomes can be reconstituted just before use by rehydration of the lyophilized products which are relatively stable. Thus, this reproducible and simple technique can be used to prepare sterilized, submicron unilamellar liposomes with a relatively high encapsulation efficiency, and excellent stability during long-term storage...|$|E
40|$|Circulating {{inflammatory}} mediators spilling {{into the}} circulation from sites of active inflammation {{are considered the}} source of remote tissue injury and associated organ dysfunction in sepsis. Hemofiltration has been proposed as a therapy for sepsis based {{on its ability to}} remove circulating inflammatory mediators by sieving or by adsorption, or both. Designing devices and methods for sepsis therapy will require optimization of these two mechanisms. In the present issue of Critical Care Forum, Kellum and Dishart report the relative effects of sieving and adsorption on plasma IL- 6 following cecal ligation and puncture in rats. The authors conclude that hemoadsorption is the main mechanism of removal, and discuss some possible implications for filter design but hemoadsorption is well dependant on hemofiltration (the so-called hemofiltration filter adsorption/synergistic effect). It is important to recognize the limitations of conventional systems; Kellum and Dishart have extended our knowledge of hemofiltration filter adsorption, which is quite different from conventional hemoadsorption. If sepsis is a manifestation of a nonlinear dynamic control system out of control, then filtration at modest doses with a large <b>pore</b> <b>filter</b> may succeed as well as high-volume hemofiltration with a conventional cut-off filter.

Airborne particles were collected with a tandem filter system sampler composed of a 5 μm <b>pore</b> <b>filter</b> and a 0. 3 μm pore Millipore filter in springtime at the Stockholm University campus in Stockholm. A fairly good correlation was observed between numbers of birch pollen and the amount of birch pollen antigens above 5 μm in diameter.

The appearance of a maximum value of birch pollen antigens collected on Millipore filters seemed to be delayed a few days after a maximum values had been obtained for birch pollen on a Burkard sampler or birch pollen antigens on 5 μm pore filters. Almost all birch pollen antigens were found during the birch pollen season and recognizable amounts of birch pollen antigens were not detectable after the birch pollen season. Most of the birch pollen antigens collected on 5 μm pore filters originated from birch pollen grains. In contrast, the antigens passing through 5 μm pore filters and collected on Millipore filters did not originate from pollen grains themselves, but were micronic particles, and appeared a few days after maximum values of birch pollen had been obtained...|$|E

The exosome-enriched fraction was obtained by filtration of total extracellular vesicles through a 0. 1 μm <b>pore</b> <b>filter.</b> Transmission electron microscopy showed that cell-free urine in both groups contained vesicles from 20 to 230 nm. Immunogold staining after ultrafiltration demonstrated that 95 % and 90 % of extracellular vesicles in healthy individuals and cancer patients, respectively, were exosomes. Protein, DNA and RNA concentrations as well as size distribution of extracellular vesicles in both fractions were analyzed. Only 75 % of the total protein content of extracellular vesicles was associated with exosomes which amounted to 90 - 95 % of all vesicles. Median DNA concentrations in total extracellular vesicles and exosome-enriched fractions were 18 pg/ml and 2. 6 pg/ml urine, correspondingly.

The increase of TMP offered poor oil rejection by both filters and this was also true for slots-helix configuration...|$|R
40|$|Background: Circulating {{tumor cells}} (CTCs) are {{released}} in {{blood from the}} primary tumor, but although very heterogeneous both in size and marker expression, are very rare and provide information not available from the primary tumor. The identification of CTC cells and clusters could advance our understanding of metastasis and help personalize therapy. 1, 2 Notably, CTC clusters were shown {{to have a higher}} metastatic potential than single cells 3 but the process remains poorly understood. We present a multistage filtration system with pore sizes from 20 down to 8 3 ̆bcm for the size-selective enrichment of Ov 90 ovarian cancer cells and clusters from blood. Each captured cell population was released, cultured and characterized independently. Methods: We developed a 3 D printed multistage filtration cartridge and polymer filters with 20, 15, 12, 10 and 8 3 ̆bcm-diameter <b>pores.</b> <b>Filters</b> were stacked from 20 (top) to 8 3 ̆bcm (bottom) and used to enrich and sort Ov- 90 cells spiked in 1 : 6 mL of blood:PBS. Captured cells were released by removing individual filters from the cartridge, reverse flowing OSE medium, and then cultured separately. Results: Ov- 90 clusters were found mostly on the top filter (20 3 ̆bcm) and interestingly, few small clusters (3 - 4 cells) were found on the 8 and 10 3 ̆bcm filters, suggesting alignment of cluster cells as they pass through the pores. 2 ̆ 074 Cell and nucleus diameters were measured, and a general correlation was found between <b>filter</b> <b>pore</b> size and cell and nucleus size. Interestingly, nucleus size was found to be the single most significant parameter in determining passage of single cells and small clusters through pores. Following cell culture, two distinct phenotypes were observed: cell captured on small <b>pore</b> <b>filters</b> (8 - 12 3 ̆bcm) grew primarily in a monolayer. Cells captured on <b>filters</b> with larger <b>pores</b> (15 - 20 3 ̆bcm) first grew as monolayer, but rapidly formed cell aggregates that subsequently detached from the surface. Staining for E-Cadherin, a cell-cell adhesion protein, revealed a loss of expression of cells from <b>filter</b> with larger <b>pores.</b> Conclusion: We developed a new multistage filtration method and selectively enriched and sorted cells based primarily on their nucleus size. We identified two Ov- 90 populations with different growth behaviors with low E-cadherin expression on the cells forming clusters, which is known to correlate with metastasis. The application of multistage filters may also reveal different CTC populations based on nucleus and cell size. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
