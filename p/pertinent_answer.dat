Several alternative explanations have been proposed {{in order to provide}} a more realistic description of the financial markets ’ inner mechanisms. This debate’s importance consists in the implications of the adopted point of view on the assessment of the financial markets ’ predictability degree. [4], [5] proposed a unified approach labeled as Adaptive Markets Hypothesis. Thus, from a practical point of view, the main issue consists in providing a <b>pertinent</b> <b>answer</b> to the next question: Is an active portfolio management able to provide better results that a passive “follow the market on long-run ” strategy? If in adaptive models the markets are considered to display, at least in a certain sense, a degree of predictability, then, one of the major difficulties in supplying empirical evidences is the requirement of knowing ex ante the “exact ” forecast model used by the economic subjects. The aim of this study is providing a solution to this problem inspired by the transduction’s (supervised learning) algorithms. Our main output consists in the thesis that the forecasting errors matter for price formation in financial markets. So, despite the fact that nor the theoretical foundations nor the empirical evidences are conclusive, we argue that the nature of the “exact ” learning mechanisms can be seen as one of the key variables in investors ’ decisions and markets evolution. There is a significant positive payoff of a more detailed study of such mechanisms inside an extended framework of financial markets as complex systems...|$|E

40|$|ISSN 1613 - 0073 International audienceIn this paper, {{we present}} SHIRI-Annot, an {{automatic}} ontology- driven and unsupervised approach for the semantic annotation of doc- uments which contain {{more or less}} structured parts. The aim {{of this approach is}} to build an integration system called SHIRI 3 which allows the user access to documents related to a specific domain. In this sys- tem, the querying process is guided by an ontology of the domain and the answers are only made of the pertinent parts of the documents unlike keywords-based search engines. The ontology is described using RDFS (Resource Description Framework Schema) language. The SHIRI-Annot approach consists of locating and then annotating concept instances and their semantic relations. The locating step combines existing annotation approaches in order to locate instances in the text. The annotation step exploits a set of metadata and a set of logical rule patterns which are automatically instanciated from the domain description. These metadata are provided from the ontology or are defined specifically for the annota- tion task. The resulting annotations are represented in RDF (Resource Description Framework) language. We show through a preliminary study made on a corpus of HTML documents the usefulness of these specific metadata to represent the heterogeneity of documents. We also illus- trate through examples how the SHIRI system exploits the metadata to approximate the user queries in order to provide more <b>pertinent</b> <b>answers...</b>|$|R

Ideally we would like the mediator to retrieve such possible answers and gauge their relevance by accessing their likelihood of being <b>pertinent</b> <b>answers</b> to the query. The autonomous nature of web databases poses several challenges in realizing this objective. Such challenges include the restricted access privileges imposed on the data, the limited support for query patterns, and the bounded pool of database and network resources in the web environment. We introduce a novel query rewriting and optimization framework QPIAD that tackles these challenges. Our technique involves reformulating the user query based on mined correlations among the database attributes. The reformulated queries are aimed at retrieving the relevant possible answers in addition to the certain answers. QPIAD is able to gauge the relevance of such queries allowing tradeoffs in reducing the costs of database query processing and answer transmission. To support this framework, we develop methods for mining attribute correlations (in terms of Approximate Functional Dependencies), value distributions (in the form of Naïve Bayes Classifiers), and selectivity estimates. We present empirical studies to demonstrate that our approach is able to effectively retrieve relevant possible answers with high precision, high recall, and manageable cost. 1...|$|R
40|$|International audienceHuge {{repositories}} of pedagogical {{resources such}} as the French initiative of digital thematic libraries are now accessible by both students and professors. This high quantity of data makes their access difficult to the students, as they cannot get easily pertinent pedagogical resources that fit their needs. One way to make this access easier is to add annotations to these resources and to exploit these annotations to find <b>pertinent</b> <b>answers.</b> Of course, these annotations can be semantic. Semantic wikis are a new approach that automatically processes semantic annotations {{and that can be}} used to find the adequate resources given the requests of students. However, annotating semantically resources is not an easy task for human. Despite of their high potential, semantic wikis suffer from a lack of human provided semantic annotations, resulting in a loss of their efficiency. We propose a system (called HCA) that suggests automatically computed annotations to users in semantic wikis. In this paper users are students and professors. Users only have to validate, complete, modify, refuse or ignore these suggested annotations. Therefore, the annotation task becomes easier, and we assume that more users will provide annotations, leading to an improvement of the system and a facilitated access to pertinent pedagogical resources. The HCA system is based on collaborative filtering recommender systems, it does not exploit the content of the pages but the usage made on these pages by the students and the professors. The resulting semantic wikis contain several kinds of annotations, with different status: human, computer or human- computed provided annotations...|$|R

The first topic is Mangoni’s own reflection {{on the work of}} fellows historians of culture, as Delio Cantimori or Leone Ginzburg, from which can be drawn a main theme in Mangoni’s views since the very beginnings of her studies: that the efforts to achieve philological precision in the analysis and interpretation of texts, by connecting them to the historical context, ought to be intended as a form of commitment, albeit unaffected by ideological motives. The second topic is her conception of culture as very characterised field of knowledge, in which pressing social and political questions are reflected, and which produces very <b>pertinent</b> <b>answers</b> to them. In this perspective is considered Mangoni’s reading of Antonio Gramsci, conveyed in four essays, where it is pointed out the central importance of the State in Gramsci’s meditation of Fascism after 1929.

40|$|Within the {{conceptual}} framework of WLC 2016 we have chosen to explore a transdisciplinary approach of postmodern clothing. Fashion {{has always been a}} domain in which sociological, philosophical, political, cultural approaches have spoken about its contents and contexts. Recent sociological studies of fashion have revealed the deep meanings of conceptual clothing and the interwoven network of thoughts that is the starting point for such intellectual approaches. Fashion scholars such as Bradley Quinn, Caroline Evans, Valerie Steele or Malcolm Barnard have underlined the role of conceptual clothing in casting a light upon various social issues and symptoms. Through this paper we want to argument how layers of social meaning transform certain fashion projects in reflexions of the Zeitgeist. In the current socio-political context such investigations do not necessarily offer <b>pertinent</b> <b>answers,</b> but certainly raise more questions and awareness. By focusing on the works of Lucy and Jorge Orta, and Hussein Chalayan, our aim is to explore the different ways in which social changes, urban reconfigurations, and geographical dislocation question our notions of space, form, mobility, and identity.

40|$|While the World Trade Organization (WTO) {{system remains}} {{faithful}} to the long-standing traditional paradigm of state-to-state dispute resolution, dispute resolution mechanisms {{in the area of}} international investment are undergoing a radical change. Traditionally, the paradigm of 'diplomatic protection' has served as a basis for the settlement of investment disputes among states. In earlier commercial agreements, including the Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation Treaties (FCNs) concluded from 1940 s to 1960 s, the resolution of international investment disputes took the form of state-to-state dispute resolution. This paradigm shifted in the 1970 s when direct investor claims, modelled on treaties that European countries had been putting forward since 1959, were allowed under a series of bilateral investment treaties initiated by the United States. This shift has been reflected in subsequent efforts to reach a multilateral agreement on investment (MAI) and in many free trade agreements (FTAs). Also, in the area of international human rights law, it is an increasing trend to allow an individual to have direct recourse to international human rights protection bodies, such as the Human Rights Committee established under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, after the exhaustion of domestic remedies. The allowance of direct claims has helped {{to make up for the}} typical shortcomings of the diplomatic protection mechanism where, the espousing state has frequently exercised excessive discretion in deciding whether to advance claims due to considerations of a political nature, unrelated to the particular case, so that this mechanism can increase international friction. On the other hand, the strong point of diplomatic protection has been its capacity to screen out frivolous or dishonest claims by individuals. The question whether various international dispute settlement mechanisms may eventually converge into an effective system based on a direct claim procedure is a vexing one. It is uncertain whether the model of investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) can play a pioneering role in this ongoing process. Any <b>pertinent</b> <b>answers</b> to such questions require a thorough comparison of the benefits and drawbacks of such a development. Lessons from the experiences under the ISDS system and its modification efforts should be fully taken into account so the newly emerging dispute resolution system will not lead to tension between nations in an area where precedent is scant, but the need is great., Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
