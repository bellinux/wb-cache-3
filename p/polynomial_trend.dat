40|$|Time-series Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) {{models were}} {{employed}} to model tree crown profiles for two California hardwood species (blue oak and interior live oak). There are three major components of these models: a <b>polynomial</b> <b>trend,</b> an ARMA model, and unaccounted for variation. The <b>polynomial</b> <b>trend</b> was used to achieve a stationary series. For these crown profiles, {{the use of a}} quadratic trend resulted in a stationary series for 60 % of the profiles. A cubic trend was used for another 23 %, and a quartic for 7 %. It was found that 80 % of the tree crown profiles could be modeled using a first order ARMA model [AR(1), or MA(1) ] in conjunction with a <b>polynomial</b> <b>trend</b> and another 10 % as a <b>polynomial</b> <b>trend</b> with white noise. When the coefficients of the ARMA models were statistically significant, the models proved to be both visually and statistically an improvement over the <b>polynomial</b> <b>trend.</b> Using a binary classification scheme it was possible to relate the type of ARMA model needed for a crown profile series to tree size and stand characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Singular {{spectrum}} analysis (SSA) is considered for decomposition of time series into identifiable components. The Basic SSA method is nonparametric and constructs an adaptive expansion based on singular value decomposition. The investigated modification {{is able to}} take into consideration a structure given in advance and therefore can be called semi-nonparametric. The approach called SSA with projection includes preliminary projections of rows and columns of the series trajectory matrix to given subspaces. One application of SSA with projection is the extraction of <b>polynomial</b> <b>trends,</b> e. g., a linear trend. It is shown that SSA with projection can extract <b>polynomial</b> <b>trends</b> much better than Basic SSA, especially for linear trends. Numerical examples including comparison with the least-square approach to polynomial regression are presented...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Median filters {{with larger}} windows offer greater {{smoothing}} {{and are more}} robust than the median filters of smaller windows. However, the larger median smoothers (the median filters with the larger windows) fail to track low order <b>polynomial</b> <b>trends</b> in the signals. Due to this, constant regions are produced at the signal corners, leading {{to the loss of}} fine details. In this paper, an algorithm, which combines the ability of the 3 -point median smoother in preserving the low order <b>polynomial</b> <b>trends</b> and the superior noise filtering characteristics of the larger median smoother, is introduced. The proposed algorithm (called the combiner algorithm in this paper) is evaluated for its performance on a test image corrupted with different types of noise and the results obtained are included. Keywords—Image filtering, detail preservation, median filters, nonlinear filters, order statistics filtering, Rank order filtering. I...|$|R

30|$|Using {{exhaustive}} {{regression analysis}} over the captured data shown in Fig.  9, {{it is observed}} that the linear and <b>polynomial</b> <b>trends</b> are the ones that better fit with the statistical data. The correlation coefficient is higher for the polynomial approximation than for the linear trend of data which are 0.994 and 0.947, respectively [42].
