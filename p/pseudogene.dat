5|$|Most {{other mammals}} studied, {{including}} the pig, cow, cat, dog, bushbaby, macaque, chimpanzee and orangutan, {{have a single}} Mup gene. Some, however, have an expanded number: horses have three Mup genes and gray mouse lemurs have at least two. Insects, fish, amphibia, birds and marsupials appear to have disrupted synteny at the chromosomal position of the Mup gene cluster, suggesting the gene family may be specific to placental mammals. Humans are the only placental mammals found {{not to have any}} active Mup genes; instead they have a single Mup <b>pseudogene</b> containing a mutation that causes missplicing, rendering it dysfunctional.|$|E

25|$|The CYP21A2 {{gene for}} the P450c21 enzyme (also known as 21-hydroxylase) is at 6p21.3, amid genes HLA B and HLA DR coding {{for the major}} human {{histocompatibility}} loci (HLA). CYP21A2 is paired with a nonfunctional <b>pseudogene</b> CYP21A1P. Scores of abnormal alleles of CYP21A2 have been documented, most arising from recombinations of homologous regions of CYP21A2 and CYP21A1P. Differences in residual enzyme activity of the various alleles account for the various degrees of severity of the disease.

50|$|Some gene {{families}} also contain <b>pseudogenes,</b> sequences of DNA that closely resemble established gene sequences but are non-functional. Different types of <b>pseudogenes</b> exist. Non-processed <b>pseudogenes</b> are genes that acquired mutations over time becoming non-functional. Processed <b>pseudogenes</b> are genes {{that have lost}} their function after being moved around the genome by retrotransposition. <b>Pseudogenes</b> that have become isolated from the gene family they originated in, {{are referred to as}} orphans.|$|R

25|$|Isozymes {{are usually}} the result of gene duplication, but can also arise from {{polyploidisation}} or nucleic acid hybridization. Over evolutionary time, if {{the function of the}} new variant remains identical to the original, then it is likely that one or the other will be lost as mutation accumulate, resulting in a <b>pseudogene.</b> However, if the mutations do not immediately prevent the enzyme from functioning, but instead modify either its function, or its pattern of gene expression, then the two variants may both be favoured by natural selection and become specialised to different functions. For example, they may be expressed at different stages of development or in different tissues.|$|E
2500|$|Each form of CAH is {{associated}} with a specific defective gene. [...] The most common type (95% of cases) involves the gene for 21-hydroxylase, which is found on 6p21.3 as part of the HLA complex. [...] 21-hydroxylase deficiency results from a unique mutation with two highly homologous near-copies in series consisting of an active gene (CYP21A) and an inactive <b>pseudogene</b> (CYP21P).

40|$|The gene-dense {{chromosomes}} of archaea {{and bacteria}} were long {{thought to be}} devoid of <b>pseudogenes,</b> but with the massive increase in available genome sequences, whole genome comparisons between closely related species have identified mutations that have rendered numerous genes inactive. Comparative analyses of sequenced archaeal genomes revealed numerous <b>pseudogenes,</b> which can constitute up to 8. 6 % of the annotated coding sequences in some genomes. The largest proportion of <b>pseudogenes</b> is created by gene truncations, followed by frameshift mutations. Within archaeal genomes, large numbers of <b>pseudogenes</b> contain more than one inactivating mutation, suggesting that <b>pseudogenes</b> are deleted from the genome more slowly in archaea than in bacteria.

40|$|<b>Pseudogenes</b> {{are defined}} as {{fragments}} of once-functional genes that have been silenced {{by one or more}} nonsense, frameshift or missense mutations. Despite continuing increases in the speed of sequencing and annotating bacterial genomes, the identification and categorisation of <b>pseudogenes</b> remains problematic. Even when identified, <b>pseudogenes</b> are considered to be rare and tend to be ignored. On the contrary, <b>pseudogenes</b> are surprisingly prevalent and can persist for long evolutionary time periods, representing a record of once-functional genetic characteristics. Most importantly, <b>pseudogenes</b> provide an insight into prokaryotic evolutionary history as a record of phenotypic traits that have been lost.

40|$|A simple {{kinetic model}} is {{developed}} {{that describes the}} accumulation of processed <b>pseudogenes</b> in a functional gene family. Insertion of new <b>pseudogenes</b> occurs at rate ν per gene and is countered by spontaneous deletion (at rate δ per DNA segment) of segments containing processed <b>pseudogenes.</b> If there are k functional genes in a gene family, the equilibrium number of processed <b>pseudogenes</b> is k(ν/δ), {{and the percentage of}} functional genes in the gene family at equilibrium is 1 /[1 + (ν/δ) ]. ν/δ values estimated for five gene families ranged from 1. 7 to 15. This fairly narrow range suggests that the rates of formation and deletion of processed <b>pseudogenes</b> may be positively correlated for these families. If δ is sufficiently large relative to the per nucleotide mutation rate µ (δ > 20 µ), processed <b>pseudogenes</b> will show high homology with each other, {{even in the absence of}} gene conversion between <b>pseudogenes.</b> We argue that formation of processed <b>pseudogenes</b> may share common pathways with transposable elements and retroviruses, creating the potential for correlated responses in the evolution of processed <b>pseudogenes</b> due to direct selection for control of transposable elements and/or retroviruses. Finally, we discuss the nature of the selective forces that may act directly or indirectly to influence the evolution of processed <b>pseudogenes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Processed <b>pseudogenes</b> {{result from}} reverse {{transcribed}} mRNAs. In general, because processed <b>pseudogenes</b> lack promoters, {{they are no}} longer functional from the moment they are inserted into the genome. Subsequently, they freely accumulate substitutions, insertions and deletions. Moreover, the ancestral structure of processed <b>pseudogenes</b> could be easily inferred using the sequence of their functional homologous genes. Owing to these characteristics, processed <b>pseudogenes</b> represent good neutral markers for studying genome evolution. Recently, there is an increasing interest for these markers, particularly to help gene prediction in the field of genome annotation, functional genomics and genome evolution analysis (patterns of substitution). For these reasons, we have developed a method to annotate processed <b>pseudogenes</b> in complete genomes. To make them useful to different fields of research, we stored them in a nucleic acid database after having annotated them. In this work, we screened both mouse and human complete genomes from ENSEMBL to find processed <b>pseudogenes</b> generated from functional genes with introns. We used a conservative method to detect processed <b>pseudogenes</b> in order to minimize the rate of false positive sequences. Within processed <b>pseudogenes,</b> some are still having a conserved open reading frame and some have overlapping gene locations. We designated as retroelements all reverse transcribed sequences and more strictly, we designated as processed <b>pseudogenes,</b> all retroelements not falling in the two former categories (having a conserved open reading or overlapping gene locations). We annotated 5823 retroelements (5206 processed <b>pseudogenes)</b> in the human genome and 3934 (3428 processed <b>pseudogenes)</b> in the mouse genome. Compared to previous estimations, the total number of processed <b>pseudogenes</b> was underestimated but the aim of this procedure was to generate a high-quality dataset. To facilitate the use of processed <b>pseudogenes</b> in studying genome structure and evolution, DNA sequences from processed <b>pseudogenes,</b> and their functional reverse transcribed homologs, are now stored in a nucleic acid database, HOPPSIGEN. HOPPSIGEN can be browsed on the PBIL (Pole Bioinformatique Lyonnais) World Wide Web server ([URL] or fully downloaded for local installation...|$|R
50|$|Scientists {{from all}} over the world studied and {{recognized}} a plenty of <b>pseudogenes.</b> They have launched several projects which are worldwide to identify and study the potential roles of <b>pseudogenes.</b> ENCODE is one of such projects. Even though the <b>pseudogenes</b> accelerate the issues formolecular analysis, they are still regarded as genome fossils that provide a sound record of evolution since they offer a plethora of diverse information for molecular analysis. The worldwide researchers are building different ways to identify the <b>pseudogenes</b> by various scheme and criteria for computation such that they give a set of <b>pseudogenes</b> that are consistent. Sometimes, the resurrected <b>pseudogenes</b> have been identified as functional and they may also be altered back to be non-functional, which again can be reversed. Not all the <b>pseudogenes</b> in a genome should be considered as a “junk DNA”. The evidence for functional <b>pseudogenes</b> strengthens their significance, and they have also become a hotspot in research due to their significance and possible resurrection.

Characterization of <b>pseudogenes</b> {{is important to understand}} genome dynamics and evolution, and its significance increases when several genomes of related organisms can be compared. Among yeasts, only the genome of the S. cerevisiae reference strain has been analyzed so far for <b>pseudogenes.</b> Results: We present here the first comparative analysis of <b>pseudogenes</b> within the fully sequenced and annotated genomes of eight yeast species, spanning the entire phylogenetic range of Hemiascomycetes. A total of 871 <b>pseudogenes</b> were found, out of which mutational degradation patterns and consequences on the genetic repertoire of each species could be identified. We found that most <b>pseudogenes</b> in yeasts originate from mutational degradation of gene copies formed after species-specific duplications but duplications of <b>pseudogenes</b> themselves are also encountered. In all yeasts, except in Y. lipolytica, <b>pseudogenes</b> tend to cluster in subtelomeric regions where they can outnumber the number of functional genes from 3 to 16 times. <b>Pseudogenes</b> are generally not conserved between the yeast species studied (except in two cases), consistent with their large evolutionary distances, but tend to be conserved among S. cerevisiae strains.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{characterization}} {{in the human}} genome of 966 <b>pseudogenes</b> derived from the four human Y (hY) RNAs, components of the Ro/SS-A autoantigen. About 95 % of the Y RNA <b>pseudogenes</b> are found in corresponding locations on the chimpanzee and human chromosomes. On the contrary, Y <b>pseudogenes</b> in mice are both infrequent and found in different genomic regions. In addition to this rodent/ primate discrepancy, the conservation of hY <b>pseudogenes</b> relative to hY genes suggests that they occurred after rodent/primate divergence. Flanking regions of hY <b>pseudogenes</b> contain convincing evidence for involvement of the L 1 retrotransposition machinery. Although Alu elements are found {{in close proximity to}} most hY <b>pseudogenes,</b> these are not chimeric retrogenes.
