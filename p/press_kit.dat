25|$|Sin and Punishment grew a cult {{following}} in western territories among import gamers, and {{was regarded as}} one of the best Nintendo 64 games to never see localization. Nintendo's 2001 E3 <b>press</b> <b>kit</b> mentioned that it would be on display at Nintendo's booth, but was not shown. With the release of Nintendo's Virtual Console for the Wii, Sin and Punishment became one of the most demanded titles. The game featured English voice acting, which also made it a good candidate for re-release. It was finally released on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan on September 20, 2007, in PAL regions on September 28, 2007, and in North America on October 1, 2007. The localized releases featured English menus.

The <b>press</b> <b>kit</b> also claimed that MacArthur supported the film.|$|E

500|$|The {{special edition}} diskette, a Macintosh <b>press</b> <b>kit</b> {{entitled}} [...] "Billy Idol's Cyberpunk", was an industry first. It included album clip art, sample sound bytes, a biography by Mark Frauenfelder, lyrics, and a cyberculture bibliography by Gareth Branwyn. Frauenfelder {{appeared on a}} segment of MTV News to describe the diskette's features. Plans were considered by EMI/Chrysalis to re-release the album in the following fall with an updated CD-ROM if the album was successful. As CD-ROMs were prohibitively expensive {{at the time of}} production, this was anticipated as a potential benchmark event for the music industry.

The trailer featured The Ink Spots song [...] "I Don't Want to Set the World on Fire", which the previous Fallout developer Black Isle Studios originally intended to license {{for use in the}} first Fallout game. The trailer, which was completely done with in-engine assets, closed with Ron Perlman saying his trademark line which he also spoke in the original Fallout: [...] "War. War never changes". The trailer showed a devastated Washington, D.C., evidenced by the partially damaged Washington Monument in the background as well as the crumbling buildings that surrounded a rubble-choked city thoroughfare.|$|E
500|$|... "All Things Must Pass" [...] {{was not a}} {{track that}} Harrison ever played in concert, {{although}} it appeared on his preliminary setlist for the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh shows. He twice performed the song live in front of TV cameras during {{the final years of}} his life, beginning with his appearance with Ravi Shankar on VH1's Hard Rock Live, filmed in New York on 14 May 1997. The pair were on the show to promote their recent collaboration, Chants of India, but at host John Fugelsang's urging, Harrison accepted an acoustic guitar and performed a brief rendition of [...] "All Things Must Pass".
