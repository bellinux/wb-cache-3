5|$|Honey {{bees are}} used commercially to produce honey. They also produce some {{substances}} used as dietary supplements with possible health benefits, pollen, <b>propolis,</b> and royal jelly, though {{all of these}} can also cause allergic reactions.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have kept}} honey bee colonies, {{commonly}} in hives, for millennia. Beekeepers collect honey, beeswax, <b>propolis,</b> pollen, and royal jelly from hives; bees are also kept to pollinate crops and to produce bees {{for sale to}} other beekeepers.|$|E
5|$|Human {{beekeeping}} or apiculture {{has been}} practised for millennia, {{since at least}} the times of Ancient Egypt and Ancient Greece. Apart from honey and pollination, honey bees produce beeswax, royal jelly and <b>propolis.</b> Bees have appeared in mythology and folklore, through all phases of art and literature, from ancient times to the present day, though primarily focused in the Northern Hemisphere, where beekeeping is far more common.|$|E
5|$|Practical uses include as food (entomophagy), in medicine, for the {{valuable}} textile silk, for dyestuffs such as carmine, in science, where the fruit fly {{is an important}} model organism in genetics, and in warfare, where insects were successfully used in the Second World War to spread disease in enemy populations. One insect, the honey bee, provides honey, pollen, royal jelly, <b>propolis</b> and an anti-inflammatory peptide, melittin; its larvae too are eaten in some societies. Medical uses of insects include maggot therapy for wound debridement. Over a thousand protein families {{have been identified in}} the saliva of blood-feeding insects; these may provide useful drugs such as anticoagulants, vasodilators, antihistamines and anaesthetics.|$|E
25|$|<b>Propolis,</b> or bee glue, {{is created}} by bees from resins, balsams, and tree saps. Some species use <b>propolis</b> to seal cracks in the hive. Dwarf honey bees use <b>propolis</b> to defend against ants by coating the branch from which their nest is suspended, to create a sticky barrier. <b>Propolis</b> is {{consumed}} by humans as a health supplement in various ways and also used in some cosmetics.|$|E
25|$|Strained honey {{has been}} passed through a mesh {{material}} to remove particulate material (pieces of wax, <b>propolis,</b> other defects) without removing pollen, minerals, or enzymes.|$|E
25|$|Beekeeping was {{traditionally}} practiced for the bees' honey harvest, although nowadays crop pollination {{service can}} often provide a {{greater part of}} a commercial beekeeper's income. Other hive products are pollen, royal jelly, and <b>propolis,</b> which are also used for nutritional and medicinal purposes, and beeswax, which is used in candle making, cosmetics, wood polish, and for modelling. The modern use of hive products has changed little since ancient times.|$|E
500|$|Honey bee {{products}} are used medicinally in apitherapy across Asia, Europe, Africa, Australia, and the Americas, {{despite the fact}} that the honey bee was not introduced to the Americas until the colonization by Spain and Portugal. [...] They are by far the most common medical insect product both historically and currently, and the most frequently referenced of these is honey. It can be applied to skin to treat excessive scar tissue, rashes, and burns, and as an eye poultice to treat infection. Honey is taken for digestive problems and as a general health restorative. It is taken hot to treat colds, cough, throat infections, laryngitis, tuberculosis, and lung diseases. Apitoxin (honey bee venom) is applied via direct stings to relieve arthritis, rheumatism, polyneuritis, and asthma. [...] <b>Propolis,</b> a resinous, waxy mixture collected by honeybees and used as a hive insulator and sealant, is often consumed by menopausal women because of its high hormone content, and it is said to have antibiotic, anesthetic, and anti-inflammatory properties. Royal jelly is used to treat anaemia, gastrointestinal ulcers, arteriosclerosis, hypo- and hypertension, and inhibition of sexual libido. [...] Finally Bee bread, or bee pollen, is eaten as a generally health restorative, and is said to help treat both internal and external infections. One of the major peptides in bee venom, Melittin, has the potential to treat inflammation in sufferers of Rheumatoid arthritis and Multiple sclerosis.|$|E

2500|$|The use of {{adjunctive}} antibiotics {{is usually}} uncalled for when proper debridement procedures can be executed {{in a conventional}} periapical lesion of endodontic origin; however, they can be centrally important {{to the treatment of}} a progressive or persistent infection. [...] It has been proposed, however, that disinfection of the root canal by means of an antibacterial agent, such as <b>propolis</b> [...] or otosporin, can lead to improved healing by reducing and controlling pulpal and periapical inflammatory reactions. [...] This would, in turn, promote the healing process as well as provide for better control, prevention and reduction of post-treatment pain and discomfort.|$|E
2500|$|Workers of the Cape {{honeybee}} (Apis mellifera capensis) 'socially encapsulate' the parasitic {{small hive beetle}} (Aethina tumida). A. tumida {{feeds on}} the brood, pollen and honey, but due to its robust exoskeletal armour and habit of remaining motionless in small gaps (with its head tucked turtle-like underneath its pronotum), honeybee workers {{find it difficult to}} decapitate and kill. Instead, workers seal the small hive beetles in using 'bee glue' (<b>propolis).</b> Construction of the 'propolis prisons' by some workers takes 1–4 days but is accompanied by other workers guarding the small hive beetle to prevent it escaping. Guards have been observed remaining day and night for up to 57 days and attacking the small hive beetle if it tried to escape.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "waggle dance" [...] is used {{to relay}} {{information}} about more distant food sources. In order to do this, the dancing bee moves forward a certain distance on the vertically hanging honeycomb in the hive, then traces a half circle {{to return to her}} starting point, whereupon the dance begins again. On the straight stretch, the bee [...] "waggles" [...] with her posterior. The direction of the straight stretch contains the information about the direction of the food source, the angle between the straight stretch and the vertical being precisely the angle which the direction of flight has to the position of the sun. The distance to the food source is relayed by the time taken to traverse the straight stretch, one second indicating a distance of approximately one kilometer (so the speed of the dance is inversely related to the actual distance). The other bees take in the information by keeping in close contact with the dancing bee and reconstructing its movements. They also receive information via their sense of smell about what is to be found at the food source (type of food, pollen, <b>propolis,</b> water) as well as its specific characteristics. The orientation functions so well that the bees can find a food source {{with the help of the}} waggle dance even if there are hindrances they must detour around like an intervening mountain.|$|E
60|$|There {{is indeed}} in Piso, a very odd History, which this {{relation}} {{may make the}} more probable; and {{that is in the}} 2. Chapter of the 4. Book of his Natural History of Brasil, where he says, Porro præter tot documenta fertilitatis circa vegetabilia & sensitiva marina telluris æmula, accidit & illud, quod paucis à Paranambucensi milliaribus, piscatoris uncum citra intentionem contingat infigi vadis petrosis, & loco piscis spongia, coralla, aliasque arbusculas marinas capi.

50|$|<b>Propolis</b> {{is another}} {{byproduct}} of the bee hive. Certain races of bees {{are more prone to}} using <b>propolis.</b> <b>Propolis</b> can be collected on special plastic <b>propolis</b> screens. The tendency of the bees is to use <b>propolis</b> as a glue to seal openings that are too small for a bee to crawl through. A <b>propolis</b> screen is usually put in place of an inner cover. It has small openings that are propolized by the bees. The <b>propolis</b> screen can be frozen which hardens the <b>propolis.</b> Once the <b>propolis</b> is frozen it can be easily knocked off and collected. Bee races that propolize heavily are usually not desirable as it makes other hive manipulation more difficult. There is a good market for <b>propolis</b> in medicinal and pharmacological industries.|$|E

50|$|Honey and <b>propolis,</b> a glue like {{substance}} that bees use as sealant, collected by T. angustula have some health benefits for humans. The honey and <b>propolis</b> contain various chemicals that show antibacterial activity towards an infection causing bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus. Honey and <b>propolis</b> gathered from different geographical areas have different chemical compositions yet they all exhibit {{some type of}} antibacterial activity. Another bee, Apis mellifera, produces honey and <b>propolis</b> with very similar qualities.|$|E
50|$|<b>Propolis</b> is a {{resinous}} mixture {{collected by}} honey bees from tree buds, sap flows or other botanical sources, {{which is used}} as a sealant for unwanted open spaces in the hive. Although <b>propolis</b> is alleged to have health benefits (tincture of <b>Propolis</b> is marketed as a cold and flu remedy), it may cause severe allergic reactions in some individuals. <b>Propolis</b> is also used in wood finishes, and gives a Stradivarius violin its unique red color.|$|E

50|$|While T. iridipennis gathers <b>propolis</b> to {{reinforce}} its nest, people have harvested it and discovered {{it to have}} {{a wide spectrum of}} pharmacological activities. <b>Propolis</b> exhibits notable antibacterial and antiviral properties. The pharmacological properties of <b>propolis</b> are dependent on a variety of factors including plants visited by the T. iridipennis hive and the amount of pollution present in their environment. A study by Kothai et. al. showed that T. iridipennis hives in highly polluted environments collected <b>propolis</b> which exhibited markedly reduced activity against various gram positive and gram negative bacteria.|$|E
50|$|In neotropical regions, in {{addition}} to a large variety of trees, bees may also gather resin from flowers in the genera Clusia and Dalechampia, which are the only known plant genera that produce floral resins to attract pollinators. Clusia resin contains polyprenylated benzophenones. In some areas of Chile, <b>propolis</b> contains viscidone, a terpene from Baccharis shrubs, and in Brazil, naphthoquinone epoxide has recently been isolated from red <b>propolis,</b> and prenylated acids such as 4-hydroxy-3,5-diprenyl cinnamic acid have been documented. An analysis of <b>propolis</b> from Henan, China found sinapinic acid, isoferulic acid, caffeic acid, and chrysin, with the first three compounds demonstrating antibacterial properties. Also, Brazilian red <b>propolis,</b> largely derived from Dalbergia ecastaphyllum plant resin, has high relative percentages of the isoflavonoids 3-hydroxy-8,9-dimethoxypterocarpan and medicarpin. Other flavonoids commonly present include galangin and pinocembrin. Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) is also a component of some varieties of <b>propolis</b> from New Zealand.|$|E
5000|$|The National Institutes of Health rates <b>propolis</b> as [...] "possibly effective" [...] for {{treating}} cold sores, genital herpes, and post-surgery mouth pain. Currently, there is [...] "insufficient evidence" [...] {{to rate the}} effectiveness of <b>propolis</b> in treating other conditions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Propolis</b> {{is used by}} some string {{instrument}} makers (violin, viola, cello and bass) as a varnish ingredient. Some workers use it to seal the surface of newly made bridges. <b>Propolis</b> was purportedly used by Antonio Stradivari in the varnish of his instruments.|$|E
50|$|The {{walls of}} the hive are covered with a thin coating of <b>propolis,</b> a {{resinous}} substance obtained from plants. In combination with enzymes added by the worker this has antibacterial and antifungal properties. <b>Propolis</b> is used to aid with ventilation and at the entrances of hives.|$|E

50|$|<b>Propolis</b> or {{bee glue}} is a {{resinous}} mixture that honey bees produce by mixing saliva and beeswax with exudate gathered from tree buds, sap flows, or other botanical sources. It {{is used as}} a sealant for unwanted open spaces in the hive. <b>Propolis</b> is used for small gaps (approximately 6 mm or less), while larger spaces are usually filled with beeswax. Its color varies depending on its botanical source, the most common being dark brown. <b>Propolis</b> is sticky at, and above, room temperature (20 C). At lower temperatures, it becomes hard and very brittle.|$|E

50|$|Scaptotrigona postica creates <b>propolis</b> with plant secretions, saliva, and wax. It seals {{the nest}} {{but also has}} {{significant}} antiviral properties. The <b>propolis</b> from S. postica reduces production of pocornavirus 64-fold, production of influenza virus 32-fold, and production of measles virus 8-fold. It can decrease the replication of rubella virus {{at a rate of}} 103.|$|E
5000|$|The {{composition}} of <b>propolis</b> varies from hive to hive, from district to district, and from season to season. Normally, {{it is dark}} brown in color, {{but it can be}} found in green, red, black, and white hues, depending on the sources of resin found in the particular hive area. Honey bees are opportunists, gathering what they need from available sources, and detailed analyses show that the chemical {{composition of}} <b>propolis</b> varies considerably from region to region, along with the vegetation. In northern temperate climates, for example, bees collect resins from trees, such as poplars and conifers (the biological role of resin in trees is to seal wounds and defend against bacteria, fungi and insects). [...] "Typical" [...] northern temperate <b>propolis</b> has approximately 50 constituents, primarily resins and vegetable balsams (50%), waxes (30%), essential oils (10%), and pollen (5%). <b>Propolis</b> also contains persistent lipophilic acaricides, a natural pesticide that deters mite infestations.|$|E

50|$|Occasionally, worker bees {{will even}} gather various {{caulking}} compounds of human manufacture, when the usual sources {{are more difficult}} to obtain. The properties of the <b>propolis</b> depend on the exact sources used by each individual hive; therefore any potential medicinal properties that may be present in one hive's <b>propolis</b> may be absent from another's, or from another sample in the same hive.|$|E
