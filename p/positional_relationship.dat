40|$|For an {{accurate}} assessment of jaw movement, {{it is crucial}} to understand the comprehensive formation of the masticatory muscles with special reference to the relationship to the disc of the temporomandibular joint. Detailed dissection was performed on 26 head halves of 14 Japanese cadavers in order to obtain precise anatomical information of the <b>positional</b> <b>relationships</b> between the masticatory muscles and the branches of the mandibular nerve. After complete removal of the bony elements, the midmedial muscle bundle in all specimens and the discotemporal muscle bundle in 6 specimens, derivatives of the temporalis, which insert into the disc were observed. On the anterior area of the articular capsule and the disc of the temporomandibular joint, the upper head of the lateral pterygoid, the midmedial muscle bundle of temporalis and the discotemporal bundle of temporalis were attached mediolaterally, and in 3 specimens the posterosuperior margin of the zygomaticomandibularis was attached to the anterolateral area of the disc. It is suggested that these muscles and muscle bundles contribute to various mandibular movements. Although various patterns of the <b>positional</b> <b>relationships</b> between the muscles and muscle bundles and the their innervating nerves are observed in the present study, relative <b>positional</b> <b>relationships</b> of the muscles and muscle bundles and of nerves of the mandibular nerve are consistent. A possible scheme of the developmental formation of the masticatory muscles based on the findings of the <b>positional</b> <b>relationships</b> between the muscles and the nerves is presented...|$|R

In the paper, he showed that muscle mechanisms account directly for the quantity of blood pumped by the heart. Among other things, this finding provided justification for therapeutic afterload reduction. In 1963, he began investigating heart cell muscle contractions using quantitative electron microscopy. Sonnenblick argued that the <b>positional</b> <b>relationship</b> between filaments within heart muscle cells affects the force of those cells' contractions.

5000|$|Shackleton was a {{key figure}} in the field of paleoceanography, {{publishing}} over two hundred scientific papers. He was a pioneer in the use of mass spectrometry to determine changes in climate as recorded in the oxygen isotope composition of calcareous microfossils. Shackleton also found evidence that the Earth's last magnetic field reversal was 780,000 years ago. He became internationally known, in 1976, with the publication of a paper, with James Hays and John Imbrie, in Science entitled [...] "Variations in the Earth's orbit: Pacemaker of the ice ages". Using ocean sediment cores, Shackleton, Hays and Imbrie demonstrated that oscillations in climate over the past few million years could be correlated with variations in the orbital and <b>positional</b> <b>relationship</b> between the Earth and the Sun (see Milankovitch cycles).|$|E
40|$|Abstract This {{investigation}} assessed prospective {{bases of}} non-human primate cognitive operations that support serial list memory. Four macaques learned 3 -, 5 -item ordered lists of objects (as two-choice problems) and then either {{did or did}} not (in a within-subject design) receive training on pairs that linked the three original lists into a 15 -item serial order. Next, subjects experienced selective exposure trials on object pairs that either maintained or contrasted to the serial position relationships seen during original learning. Subsequent comprehensive tests assessed the interactive eVects of linking and exposure conditions on choosing in accord with a combined 15 -item serial order. Linking read-ily induced monkeys to merge lists into a 15 -item order, but restricting early exposure to pairs with the same <b>positional</b> <b>relationships</b> as original training slowed, but did not pre-vent, list combination. Exposure to <b>positional</b> <b>relationships</b> congruent with the combined (15 -item) list and diVerent from those of original 5 -item training aided both expression of the linking eVect and acquisition after no link training. Thus, list linking facilitated serial reorganization by induc-ing release from error derived from memory for prior learned <b>positional</b> <b>relationships.</b> The task was recom-mended as a prospective evaluator of continuity of cogni-tive processes among species...|$|R

Here, the numbers in the figure (see the numbers within the parentheses) respectively indicate: (1) = an object; (2) = the parallel beam light source; (3) = the screen; (4) = transmission beam; (5) = the datum circle; (6) = the origin; and (7) = a fluoroscopic image (a one-dimensional image; pθ(s)). Two datum coordinate systems xy and ts are also imagined in order to explain the positional relations and movements of features (0)-(7) in the figure. In addition, a virtual circle centered at the above-mentioned origin (6) is set on the datum plane (it will be called “the datum circle” henceforth). This datum circle (6) represents the orbit of the parallel beam irradiation optical system. In the figure above, X-Y plane rotates around the point of origin in the plane {{in such a way}} “to keep mutual <b>positional</b> <b>relationship</b> between the light source (2) and screen (7) passing through the trajectory (5).” Rotation angle of this case is defined as θ.

It {{is important}} to provide reliable curative treatment after determination {{of the extent of}} resection by preoperative imaging evaluation. Methods. Ten patients were treated for inverted nipples with subareolar abscess. Sonography and high-resolution MRI were used as preoperative imaging modalities. The endpoints of preoperative imaging evaluation were defined as the identification of the abscess site, isolated fistula site, and extent of inflammation. Results. In all patients, sonography confirmed the presence of abscesses but their locations could not be identified. Sonography could not confirm the presence of isolated fistula or inflammation.

30|$|Source {{separation}} is being actively studied for signal processing. Some methods use {{the source and}} microphone locations. Delay-and-sum beamforming and null beamforming are methods that emphasize or suppress the signal from a specific direction. These methods can be implemented with less computational complexity.

GHDSS separates mixed signals by using a higher-order decorrelation between the sound source signals and geometric constraints derived from the <b>positional</b> <b>relationships</b> among the microphones. The weak point of these methods is that they require the source and microphone locations. This prior information cannot easily be obtained in advance.|$|R
