40|$|A {{commercial}} {{color scanner}} with high resolution {{is used for}} picture processing. The scanner is modified and additional electronic instruments {{are connected to the}} built-in color computer. The operations are carried out in an on-line process, simultaneously with the scan of the picture a <b>processed</b> <b>picture</b> is recorded on a special scanner film. Because there is no storage of image datas short processing times are obtained. The image datas are handled in a color computer, a gradation processor, an operational amplifier and a comparator to realize various 2 ̆ 7 procedures of picture operations. The procedures are classified here in global, local and point operations. Global operations refer to the whole picture, these are for instance 2 ̆ 2 rectification, enlargement, density transformations. Local operations are mostly used for texture and pattern recognition and are related to the scanned picture element and its surrounding area. Point operations manipulate the information of a single picture element. The scanner generates three color signals from each picture element, which are handled in the color computer for color and signature recognition. Several operations may be carried out in the same scan. The <b>processed</b> <b>picture</b> is displayed on a b/w transparency or on a color film. A suitable display for thematic mapping is essential for a correct interpretation of the <b>processed</b> <b>picture...</b>|$|E
40|$|For {{meteorological}} research a picture processing equipment was built up to handle picture data from scanning radiometers {{on board the}} weather satellites of the NOAA 3 type. The received analog signals are digitized and stored on computer compatible tapes for processing by a computer. Simultaneously the data are fed to a picture-printer to get quick-look pictures. The picture-printer is an opto-mechanical scanner of high precision, {{the rotation of the}} film-drum of this device is synchronized with the rotation of the scanning mirrors on board the satellite. AS well pictures of the scanning radiometer system (SR) as pictures Of the very high resolution scanning radiometer-system (VHRR) can be printed with the same film-writer.

40|$|A pipelined {{architecture}} is proposed, {{based on the}} C-MOVE microprocessor design to efficiently implement structural decomposition, W-H transforming and encoding of images. To this objective, a dynamically reconfigurable multi-microprocessor architecture is proposed, realizing concurrently the regular decomposition and the W-H transformation of digital images and the resulting image subquadrants. The C-MOVE architecture {{is used for the}} implementation of the transformation, because the numerical simplicity of the W-H transform operations can be efficiently implemented by a small set of microprocessor instructions, something inherent in the C-MOVE architecture. The {{pipelined architecture}} of the proposed design is very efficiently to the simultaneous implementation of the regular decomposition and the orthogonal transformation of the resulting subquadrants of the pictures. This task is performed by dynamically adjusting to the subquadrants dimensionality, as the processing progresses through the various hierarchies of nodes of the quadtree which is associated with the <b>processed</b> <b>picture,</b> according to the regular decomposition procedure. © 1984...|$|E

40|$|The {{valuation}} of ambient services {{given by the}} forests has as objective to quantify {{the costs of the}} benefits that the diverse functions of these ecosystems bring in general for life, as creation and regulation of microclimates, water retention and regulation, control of the ground erosion and maintenance of its fertility, CO 2 absorption and the diverse recreational uses, among others. The objective of the present work is to valuate in these services given for the Billings Reservoir Watershed. For such, three different areas will be analyzed, one located in a total degraded region (urban area), another one in spread occupation region and the last in an area considered conserved. Geoprocessing tools and remote sensing techniques will be used to produce land use and occupation maps for all the Billings Dam Watershed. The results obtained singularly in each studied area could be generalized, through the replication of its attributes. Also a component of environmental education is foreseen to disseminate the obtained results for the civil society. We expect that this actions help to base public politics of valuation in water spring areas, as much for the cities as for the particular owners, who keep the integrity of its properties. For now, the Landsat- 5 /TM <b>processed</b> <b>picture</b> pointed that, approximately 43, 8 % of the watershed land use is classified as conserved areas.

Geneticists meanwhile have identified complexities relating to the nature of genetic variation and its architecture, and the importance of epigenetic variation is under debate. In this review, we highlight how complexity in both ecological ‘demands’ and the evolutionary ‘supply’ influences organisms’ ability to climb fitness landscapes that themselves change dynamically as evolution proceeds, and encourage new synthetic effort across research disciplines towards ecologically realistic studies of adaptation...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy at Loughborough University. Computer systems with all their potential could be employed as powerful tools to assist the artist during the creative <b>process</b> of <b>picture</b> making. The complex <b>process</b> of <b>picture</b> making is tentative, indeterminate, explorative and unpredictable. Perceptual uncertainty of patterns on the canvas may {{have an important role}} during such a process. For the artist, the perception of a new or alternative structure in an already structured image is plausible, his subsequent interaction with the media being consistent with this revised view of the image. Therefore, it is essential for the computer system to be able to structure and restructure the image in terms of the interpretations perceived by the artist. [Continues. ...|$|R
40|$|Three {{configurations}} of block edge detections {{based on the}} third level of the conjugate classification for binary images of the hexagonal grid, are investigated in this paper. Constructing an operation of three configurations, {{it is necessary to}} collect a state set contained 48, 66 and 90 states as the structuring patterns respectively. To represent the selected state set in equivalent detecting functions, cellular logic and conjugate computations are illustrated and compared. Because a conjugate expression uses a class representation for structuring patterns, its real implementation is very efficient. For three {{configurations of}} 0 (or 1) block edge detections, a speed-up ratio 6 - 15 compared with the same activity performed by a standard implementation in a cellular logic expression, can be measured.
