5|$|The debris disk around Beta Pictoris is seen edge-on by {{observers}} on Earth, and is orientated in a northeast-southwest direction. The disk is asymmetric: in {{the northeast}} direction {{it has been observed}} out to 1835 astronomical units from the star, while the southwest direction the extent is 1450 AU. The disk is rotating: the <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northeast of the star is moving away from Earth, while the <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southwest of the disc is moving towards Earth.|$|E
5|$|After the season, disaffection {{within the}} Southern Conference {{prompted}} seven former members, including Maryland, {{to form the}} Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). The schism was due in <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ban on bowl participation, and the vast geographic dispersion of and disparity between the sizes of member schools. Clemson, another founding ACC member, had likewise been forced to play outside the Southern Conference in 1952.|$|E
5|$|After traffic issues {{during the}} 2008 {{reconstruction}} {{work on the}} Wheeling Tunnel, local politicians suggested closing the twin tunnels altogether and building the freeway over Wheeling Hill instead. After opposition from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which represented the affected Wheeling Hill residents, the suggestions were dropped. The cost of completing the tunnel replacement project was estimated at between $60 and $80million. The total $13.7million cost of the tunnel reconstruction project was over double the original bid of $5.7million, due in <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> work delays.|$|E

5|$|At {{no point}} during The Wrath of Khan are Khan and Kirk {{in the same}} location; they {{speak to each other}} only over {{communication}} links such as view screens. This was due in <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact that the set of the Reliant was a redress of the Enterprise bridge, and the two actors' scenes were filmed four months apart. Montalb√°n recited his lines with a script assistant instead of to William Shatner.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the war, Australia's {{military}} forces were focused upon the militia and what Regular forces existed were mostly serving in the artillery or engineers and were assigned in most <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> task of coastal defence. Due to the provisions of the Defence Act 1903, which precluded sending conscripts overseas, upon the outbreak of war it was realised that a totally separate, all volunteer force would need to be raised. This force was known as the Australian Imperial Force (AIF).|$|E
5|$|Attendance for Toronto FC dipped during 2012 and 2013 due to {{continued}} poor results by the team.

5|$|By the 15th century, English {{was back}} in fashion among all classes, though much changed; the Middle English form showed many signs of French influence, both in {{vocabulary}} and spelling. During the English Renaissance, many words were coined from Latin and Greek origins. Modern English has extended this custom of flexibility, {{when it comes to}} incorporating words from different languages. Thanks in large <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> British Empire, the English language is the world's unofficial lingua franca.|$|E
5|$|Due in <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{diffusion}} {{of national and}} Republican ideas across France {{during the second half}} of the Third Republic, the Bastille lost an element of its prominence as a symbol by the 20th century. Nonetheless, the Place de la Bastille continued to be the traditional location for left wing rallies, particularly in the 1930s, the symbol of the Bastille was widely evoked by the French Resistance during the Second World War and until the 1950s Bastille Day remained the single most significant French national holiday.|$|E
5|$|Due in <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{political}} conditions {{in what would}} become a united Kingdom of Italy only in 1861, the variation of apothecaries' systems and standard weights in this region was enormous.

5|$|During {{the decline}} of the Roman Empire and the Early Middle Ages, much of the quality {{breeding}} stock developed during the classical period was lost due to uncontrolled breeding and had to be built up again over the following centuries. In the west, this may have been due in <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> reliance of the British and Scandinavians on infantry-based warfare, where horses were only used for riding and pursuit.|$|E
5|$|From {{national}} hospital admission databases {{it appears}} that the need for neurosurgical intervention for IIH has increased markedly over the period between 1988 and 2002. This has been attributed at least in <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rising prevalence of obesity, although some of this increase may be explained by the increased popularity of shunting over optic nerve sheath fenestration.|$|E

5|$|Historian Nancy Bristow {{has argued}} that the pandemic, when {{combined}} with the increasing number of women attending college, contributed to the success of women in the field of nursing. This was due in <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> failure of medical doctors, who were predominantly men, to contain and prevent the illness. Nursing staff, who were predominantly women, felt more inclined to celebrate the success of their patient care and less inclined to identify the spread of the disease with their own work.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, Ford {{tried to}} revive the Continental brand as a {{standalone}} line of ultra luxury automobiles, but abandoned the attempt after the 1957 model year, by which time around 3000 Mark II cars had been built. The failure was due in <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> price tag of $9695, {{an extraordinary amount of}} money for the time. The Continental thereafter became a successful car model under Ford's Lincoln brand.|$|E

The investigation eventually proved inconclusive in 1993, when Attorney General Sir Nicholas Lyell decided that proceeding with the investigation would not serve the public, due in <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> excessive time that had passed since Hendrix's death.|$|E
