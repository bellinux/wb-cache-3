The rotavirus vaccine is recommended in children. Treatment involves getting enough fluids. For mild or moderate cases, this can typically be achieved by drinking oral rehydration solution (a combination of water, salts, and sugar). In those who are breast fed, continued breastfeeding is recommended. For more severe cases, intravenous fluids may be needed. Fluids may also be given by a nasogastric tube. Zinc supplementation is recommended in children. Antibiotics are generally not needed.|$|E

25|$|Sterilization: <b>Proper</b> <b>disposal</b> and {{treatment}} of all materials that may have {{come into contact with}} cholera victims' feces (e.g., clothing, bedding, etc.) are essential.

25|$|Prevention is by {{improved}} sanitation, {{which includes}} improving access to toilets and <b>proper</b> <b>disposal</b> of feces. Handwashing with soap appears protective. In areas {{where more than}} 20% {{of the population is}} affected, treating everyone at regular intervals is recommended. Reoccurring infections are common. There is no vaccine. Treatments recommended by the World Health Organization are the medications albendazole, mebendazole, levamisole, or pyrantel pamoate. Other effective agents include tribendimidine and nitazoxanide.|$|E

Chelation for those with long-term exposure is of unclear benefit. In certain communities that survive on fishing, rates of mercury poisoning among children have been as high as 1.7 per 100.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, 25 {{states have}} {{implemented}} laws {{that require the}} recycling of electronic waste. Of those, 23 have incorporated some form of extended producer responsibility into their laws. According to analysis done by the Product Stewardship Institute, some states have not enacted EPR laws {{because of a lack}} of recycling infrastructure and funds for <b>proper</b> e-waste <b>disposal.</b> In contrast, according to a study of EPR legislation done by the Electronics TakeBack Coalition, states that have seen success in their e-waste recycling programs have done so because they have developed a convenient e-waste infrastructure or the state governments have instituted goals for manufacturers to meet. Essentially, these EPR programs have included some driver for increased collection of e-waste, and that is why these states have seen a greater impact on <b>proper</b> e-waste <b>disposal</b> than others.|$|R

Roman Catholic churches will usually have a special basin (a Sacrarium) that leads directly into the ground for the purpose of <b>proper</b> <b>disposal.</b> A hinged lid is kept over the holy water basin to distinguish it from a regular sink basin, which is often just beside it. Items that contained holy water are separated, drained of the holy water, and then washed in a regular manner in the adjacent sink.|$|E
25|$|Hunting {{often had}} {{elaborate}} preparations, such as fasting and religious rituals performed by medicine men {{before and after}} the hunt. In Lipan culture, since deer were protected by Mountain Spirits, great care was taken in Mountain Spirit rituals in order to ensure smooth deer hunting. Also the slaughter of animals must be performed following certain religious guidelines (many of which are recorded in religious stories) from prescribing how to cut the animals, what prayers to recite, and <b>proper</b> <b>disposal</b> of bones. A common practice among Southern Athabascan hunters was the distribution of successfully slaughtered game. For example, among the Mescalero a hunter was expected to share as much as one half of his kill with a fellow hunter and with needy people back at the camp. Feelings of individuals concerning this practice spoke of social obligation and spontaneous generosity.|$|E
25|$|Control of {{outbreaks}} requires coordinated medical services, {{alongside a}} certain level of community engagement. The medical services include rapid detection of cases of disease, contact tracing of those who have come into contact with infected individuals, quick access to laboratory services, proper healthcare for those who are infected, and <b>proper</b> <b>disposal</b> of the dead through cremation or burial. Samples of body fluids and tissues from people with the disease should be handled with special caution. Prevention includes limiting the spread of disease from infected animals to humans. This may be done by handling potentially infected bushmeat only while wearing protective clothing and by thoroughly cooking it before eating it. It also includes wearing proper protective clothing and washing hands when around a person with the disease. No specific treatment or vaccine for the virus is available, although a number of potential treatments are being studied. Supportive efforts, however, improve outcomes. This includes either oral rehydration therapy (drinking slightly sweetened and salty water) or giving intravenous fluids as well as treating symptoms.|$|E

2500|$|Depending on {{the source}} and ingredients, there are various {{ways in which the}} public can dispose of {{pharmaceutical}} and personal care products. In the case of pharmaceutical products, the most environmentally safe disposal method is {{to take advantage of a}} community drug take-back programs that collect drugs at a central location for <b>proper</b> <b>disposal.</b> [...] Several local public health departments in the United States have initiated pharmaceutical take-back programs. In addition, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) periodically promotes local take-back programs as well as a program called the National Take Back Initiative. Currently, take back programs are funded by state or local health departments or are volunteer programs through pharmacies or health care providers. In recent years, the proposition that pharmaceutical companies should be responsible for their products “from the cradle to the grave,” has been gaining traction. [...] This philosophy suggests that the manufacturers should fund the <b>proper</b> <b>disposal</b> of pharmaceutical products. Take back programs should exist in every community, and if further information is required on the matter the city officials should be contacted. The Environmental Protection Agency and the Office of National Drug Control Policy further emphasize that if no program is available to follow the subsequent measurements: ...|$|E
2500|$|... 80% {{of pills}} {{in the world}} are packed with blister packaging, which is the most {{convenient}} type for several reasons. Blister packs have two main components, the “lid” and the “blister” (cavity). Lid is mainly manufactured with aluminum (Al) and paper. The Cavity consists of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polypropylene (PP), polyester (PET) or aluminum (Al). If users employ <b>proper</b> <b>disposal</b> methods, all these materials can be recycled and the harmful effects to the environment can be minimized. However, a problem arises with the improper disposal either by burning or disposing as normal household waste.|$|E
2500|$|Within {{a year of}} operations, a Bomarc-A with {{a nuclear}} warhead caught fire at McGuire AFB on 7 June 1960 after its {{on-board}} helium tank exploded. While the missile's explosives did not detonate, the heat melted the warhead and released plutonium, which the fire crews spread. The Air Force and the Atomic Energy Commission cleaned up the site and covered it with concrete. This was the only major incident involving the weapon system. The site remained in operation for several years following the fire. Since its closure in 1972, the area has remained off limits, primarily due to low levels of plutonium contamination. [...] In 2002, the concrete at the site was removed and transported to Lakehurst Naval Air Station for transport by rail to a site for <b>proper</b> <b>disposal.</b>|$|E
