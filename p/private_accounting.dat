50|$|Auditing as a {{tool for}} {{effective}} governance has been recognized and practiced since the Spanish colonial era. One proof of this was the residencia, an inquiry into the administration of an outgoing Governor General and consequently of other officials. Conducted by the Royal Audiencia, it was designed to hold colonial officials to strict accountability for all acts during their term of office. Another was the visita de tierra, a visit of inspection made every three years, which often revealed glaring anomalies in the handling of local government accounts.Colonial officials also performed investigations akin to audit at the time. One was a fraud audit of sorts for galleon trade conducted in the early 1700s. Another, which involved the inspection of the Misericordia de Manila in 1751, had shades of financial audit.In 1739, a Royal Decree by the King of Spain established the royal exchequer which was the national treasury of that era. All books of accounts of the Spanish colonial government were required to pass through the scrutiny and certification of the contador or the accountant and that of the oidor, a representative of the Spanish crown, who by the nature of his duties may be considered as the precursor of the auditor.By mid-19th century, the Tribunal de Cuentas was created. It functioned as the supreme auditing institution of the islands {{until the end of the}} Spanish rule in 1898. Staffed by a president, two auditors, a fiscal, accountants and examiners, the Tribunal had exclusive jurisdiction over the audit of all financial matters affecting the colony. These personnel, all appointees of the King, were required by law to review all vouchers and to cross-check them against corresponding entries in the books of accounts. The Birth of an InstitutionNurturing a nascent government requires a mixture of boldness and prudence. And at a time when the early Philippine government was being zealously fleshed out by its American rulers emboldened by their newfound power, then President William McKinley ensured a healthy dose of prudence in these activities.An unnumbered memorandum signed on May 8, 1899 by McKinley gave birth to the Office of the Auditor for the Philippine Islands.By 1900, the Office had become a fixture of government. The civil government was formally ushered in 1901 under William Howard Taft. The major change in the nature of government had ripple effects in the structure of government. One result of such change was the conversion of the Office of the Auditor of the Philippine Islands to the Bureau of the Insular Auditor.However, it was more than a mere change of name. A provincial audit division was created for the Bureau. Moreover, double-entry bookkeeping was introduced which accounted for fuller analysis of settlements and ensured a higher degree of correctness.In 1905, a change of guard took place. Taft resigned as Civil Governor and was replaced by Luke E. Wright who led as Governor General. Under his administration, Act No. 1402 was passed whereby the Bureau of the Insular Auditor was renamed the Bureau of Audits. Growth and Changes: Becoming A Stronger InstitutionAs the nation celebrated its independence with the promulgation of the 1935 Constitution, the institution also reached a milestone. The 1935 Constitution expressly provided for a General Auditing Office, thereby elevating the audit institution to a constitutional body. Renamed as the General Auditing Office or GAO, it now embarked on a full Filipinization of the institution as a reflection of the government-wide transition to self-governance. For the first time, the institution was headed by a Filipino Auditor General in the person of the Hon. Jaime Hernandez.As a major stride towards the independence of the audit institution, the GAO was explicitly placed under the direction and control of an Auditor General to separate it as an organization from the Executive and other departments of the government.In 1972, the country was placed under Martial Law. Government experienced a major upheaval, and the GAO was not exempted. The GAO was renamed the Commission on Audit (COA) and was granted broader powers under the new Constitution promulgated in 1973. Under this Constitution, COA was given a broader area of audit coverage by including the accounts of all subdivisions, agencies, instrumentalities of government and government-owned-and-controlled corporations among those to be examined, audited and settled.As opposed to having an Auditor General single-handedly leading the GAO, the new Constitution provided for a three-man collegial Commission on Audit. This change aimed to strengthen the independence of the auditing office and improve the quality of its decisions, given the rationale that a three-man body was less susceptible to pressure than an office held by a single person. It worked as a built-in internal check within the Commission and encouraged opposing views to surface thereby resulting in earnest consultation and better deliberation.In the years that ensued, the Commission was a hub of activity. A landmark legislation on auditing, Presidential Decree 1445 or the Government Auditing Code, was promulgated in 1978. A Standard Government Chart of Accounts was likewise issued which greatly facilitated financial audit for computerization purposes. The Commission also implemented its comprehensive audit program focusing on the 3Es: economy, efficiency and effectiveness. Installation of this program represented a break from tradition that laid undue emphasis on compliance and voucher audit. And on top of all these, the Commission embarked on a massive reorganization and professionalization of its personnel.This era will also be remembered for the significant involvement of COA in international events such as initiating the establishment of the Asian Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (ASOSAI), on to sponsorships of trainings for Asia’s auditors and culminating with the hosting of the XI International Congress of Supreme Audit Institutions (INCOSAI) in 1983. It was also during this time that a COA Chairman was first elected to the United Nations Board of Auditors.Years later, the world witnessed the 1986 EDSA Revolution. It was truly a historical event that highlighted the need for reforms in government as a whole. It provided everyone a chance for introspection and created an avenue towards change. As fate would have it, the COA again found itself working under a new government, under a new Constitution and with an even broader scope of authority.The 1987 Constitution maintained the independence of the Commission on Audit as the supreme auditing arm of the Philippine government. Moreover, the Constitution reiterated COA’s role as the sole official external auditor of government agencies as well as government-owned- and-controlled corporations (GOCCs). In other words, the previous practice of some GOCCs and other government agencies of hiring <b>private</b> <b>accounting</b> firms as a requirement of foreign funding institutions to act as their auditors for foreign-assisted projects was no longer allowed.Change, it seems, is the inescapable destiny of the Commission. But as history proves, whatever the nature of change brought about by national political events, the Commission manages to make it for the better.|$|E
40|$|Proposals {{to allow}} <b>private</b> <b>accounts</b> under Social Security were {{introduced}} long before George Bush was elected President, {{and support for}} privatization in some form will survive his administration and the economic downturn that followed. This paper studies the impact that <b>private</b> <b>accounts</b> would have on risk/return investment tradeoffs available to Social Security participants who save and invest {{on an ongoing basis}} outside the Social Security system. For such investor/participants, we show that the reduction in total diversifiable risk afforded by traditional Social Security accounts would be more than sufficient in many cases to compensate for the opportunity cost of opting-out of a privatization program if one were enacted. The risk of financing <b>private</b> <b>accounts</b> by diverting mandatory contributions away from guaranteed benefit accounts, on the other hand, would be proportionately higher for those with little or no private savings or investments outside the Social Security system. The paper concludes, therefore, that privatization would lead to imprudent risks being borne by those who can least afford to do so, and would offer no significant advantage to others.

40|$|This article explores {{whether the}} {{attitude}} of preparers towards lobbying to a <b>private</b> <b>accounting</b> standard setter is different depending on the regulatory background of the preparers’ home country. Prior literature examined the preparers’ incentives and preparers’ characteristics as drivers {{to participate in the}} due process of international accounting standard setting, but it did not investigate the impact of the preparers’ national regulatory background on participation. As a result of the acceptance of the International Financial Reporting Standards promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) in different countries, preparers who are traditionally accustomed with an accounting standard setting process initiated by governments with few opportunities for formal participation, are now able to participate in a <b>private</b> <b>accounting</b> standard setting process characterized by several possibilities for participation. Comparing survey evidence of Belgian preparers with existing survey evidence of UK preparers, we notice that the participation methods used, the perception on the effectiveness of the participation methods and the reasons for non-participation differ across both groups of preparers. This finding suggests that the national regulatory background of the preparers may affect the behaviour of preparers in their decision to participate in <b>private</b> <b>accounting</b> standard setting. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Usually the big {{question}} among accounting students is tax or audit. However, {{there is a third}} option. Accounting students may find a carer in <b>private</b> <b>accounting</b> a better fit for them.

It was easier for me to decide which field I wanted to peruse after experience public and <b>private</b> <b>accounting</b> through internships. The fields of private and public accounting are vastly different. These fields have different education requirements, encouraged certifications, working environments, day-to-day schedules, and future career opportunities. In addition to these factors, recruiting for a public accounting firm requires extra involvement including: networking events, summer leadership programs, and internships. Looking back on my experiences through the recruiting process, I hope to provide useful tips for meetings professionals, and what to expect during a summer leadership experience and internship. As I was searching for <b>private</b> <b>accounting</b> opportunities, I noticed most positions required previous work experience. I found several opportunities while finishing school to gain the experience employers require once students graduate. I hope sharing these potential opportunists will encourage students to take advantage of the work experiences available to them while they are still in school. Lastly, I hope to clarify for future students the requirements for the CMA and CPA, and the value these certifications provide. I enjoyed both my internship experiences and the opportunities they provided for me to learn about public and <b>private</b> <b>accounting.</b> I hope by comparing the differences I noticed in these two field, I can help future accounting students determine which field of accounting they want to pursue and identify the step necessary for them to reach their ultimate career goal...|$|E

The trustees of the Social Security Trust Funds project that Social Security will become insolvent in 2041 (Board of Trustees 2005).

Isn’t 2041 a long time from now? Why not wait for a while before making a change to such an important government program? The {{purpose of this article is}} to provide an introduction to Social Security private accounts—what they can and cannot do for those who choose to use them and for looming Social Security deficits. The discussion will also explore why it is expedient to introduce these accounts now to deal with a problem that will not become acute for decades. Several different precise proposals about <b>private</b> <b>accounts</b> for Social Security have been put forward. These proposals vary in terms of the amounts that can be contributed, permissible investments, and the way funds can be used.

How Would <b>Private</b> <b>Accounts</b> Operate?
