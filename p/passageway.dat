40|$|AbstractCross <b>passageways</b> {{have been}} {{commonly}} {{applied in the}} evacuation system of tunnels, and the width and spacing of the cross <b>passageways</b> decide the evacuation capacity of the tunnel. In design, increasing {{the width of the}} cross <b>passageways</b> and reducing their spacing can improve the evacuation ability of tunnels. However, it will certainly increase the cost of the project. Under the precondition of meeting evacuation requirements, an optimization model was established in this article, which aimed at reducing the cost of the project. Finally, discussions on the application of this optimization model were carried on, and this method may provide reference for designing cross <b>passageways...</b>|$|R

5|$|Originally, the {{transept}} chambers {{would have}} been covered with one large (or several smaller) capstones, enclosing the chambers containing human remains. The earth covering and {{the upper part of}} the cromlech have been removed, leaving the <b>passageway</b> and lateral chambers fully exposed. There is no record of a capstone having been discovered.|$|E
5|$|The Keppel <b>passageway</b> {{was used}} by Asian and early European sailors and traders for {{hundreds}} of years to sail past Singapore. Between 1405 and 1433, Zheng He made seven voyages to more than 30 countries, travelling in fleets of up to 300 ships to the South Pacific, Indian Ocean, Persian Gulf and Africa. The admiral travelled on the order of the Chinese Emperor to establish trade relations with countries west of China. He is believed to have sailed through the waters off Labrador Park, though whether he landed in Singapore is uncertain. In the 17th century, the <b>passageway</b> was abandoned in favour of the wider and more open Main Straits, that lies south of Pulau Satamu, where Raffles Lighthouse stands today.|$|E

40|$|A sensor for {{force is}} formed from an {{elastomeric}} cylinder having a region with apertures. The apertures have <b>passageways</b> formed between them, and an optical fiber is introduced into these <b>passageways,</b> where the optical fiber has a grating for measurement of tension positioned in the <b>passageways</b> between apertures. Optionally, a temperature measurement sensor {{is placed in}} or around the elastomer for temperature correction, and if required, a copper film may be deposited in the elastomer for reduced sensitivity to spot temperature variations in the elastomer near the sensors...|$|R
5|$|Britain {{captured}} Acadia from France in Queen Anne's War (1702–1713), but the Treaty of Utrecht left Cape Breton Island in French hands, and did {{not clearly}} demarcate a boundary between New France and the British colonies on the Atlantic coast. To protect the crucial <b>passageway</b> of the Saint Lawrence River {{into the heart of}} New France, France built a strong fortress at Louisbourg on the Atlantic coast of Cape Breton Island.|$|E
5|$|Following a lead, Sora, Donald, and Goofy enter a <b>passageway</b> through Twilight Town. There they {{encounter}} Axel, who sacrifices himself {{to create a}} <b>passageway</b> to the World That Never Was, the headquarters of Organization XIII, with Kingdom Hearts looming overhead as a heart-shaped moon. Sora finds Kairi and Riku, the latter of whose appearance has been changed to that of Xehanort's Heartless. King Mickey encounters DiZ, who reveals himself to be the true Ansem, Xehanort's mentor. Ansem uses a device that dissipates some of Kingdom Hearts' power, but a system overload causes the device to self-destruct, both engulfing Ansem and miraculously returning Riku to his original form. At {{the top of the}} Castle That Never Was, Sora and company battle Xemnas, who uses what remains of Kingdom Hearts to power his multiple forms. After Sora and Riku destroy Xemnas, the two are reunited with their friends at their home, Destiny Islands. A post-credits scene shows Sora, Kairi and Riku read a letter from Mickey, which is hidden from the player.|$|E
5|$|In {{conjunction}} with {{the reconstruction of the}} main line station above, a new ticket hall was excavated below the concourse with two sets of escalators replacing the lifts. The escalators provide access to and from an intermediate passenger circulation level, which, in turn, gives access to the Northern line Charing Cross branch platforms and two further sets of escalators; one set each serving the northbound and southbound Victoria and Northern line Bank branch platforms. Interchanges between the northbound and southbound Victoria and Northern Bank Line platforms are made via a <b>passageway</b> at the lower level so as to avoid the need to use the escalators. An emergency stair to the intermediate interchange level is located midway along the <b>passageway.</b> The Victoria line platforms opened on 1 December 1968 when the second section of the line was opened between Highbury & Islington and Warren Street. Disused passages remain with tiling and posters from the 1960s.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, {{a decade before}} the tunnel was {{actually}} constructed, a rumor circulated that such a <b>passageway</b> already existed connecting the White House to the Treasury Building. According to one account, the rumor started as a joke among journalists covering the White House, but gained serious traction, with some accounts even suggesting that Ogden L. Mills was secretly accessing the White House via the purported passage to meet with President Herbert Hoover.|$|E
5|$|The Euston to Moorgate section reopened on 20 April 1924, {{along with}} the new tunnels linking Euston to Camden Town. The rest of the line to Clapham Common reopened on 1 December 1924. At {{the same time as}} the tunnels were being enlarged, the {{stations}} were modernised, with longer platforms, a new tiling scheme on platform and <b>passageway</b> walls and new frontages to the surface buildings. Some stations also received escalators to replace the original lifts.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} had two main entrances: a main entrance {{at ground level}} that faced east onto Queen's Park Drive, and a connecting <b>passageway</b> from the Royal Ontario Museum from {{what used to be}} the Mineralogy Gallery. On the wall opposite from the ticket booth and coat check was an evocative quote from Dante Alighieri Divine Comedy. Admission to either facility allowed visitors to see exhibits in both buildings, though a planetarium show cost extra.|$|E

50|$|At {{the middle}} level, the station site is crossed {{north to south}} by four {{pedestrian}} <b>passageways.</b> The eastern three of these, the Passage Bahnhofstrasse, the Passage Löwenstrasse and the Passage Gessnerallee, form an interconnected complex with the ShopVille shopping complex and give direct {{access to all the}} station's platforms {{as well as to the}} surrounding streets. An intermediate underground level, immediately below the Haupthalle, connects these <b>passageways</b> with the concourse. The westernmost passage, the Passage Sihlquai, lies to the west of the Sihl, which passes under the station from north to south at the same level as the <b>passageways.</b> Because of the presence of the river channel, the Sihlquai passage has no direct connection to the other <b>passageways,</b> but it connects to streets to the north and south of the station, and to all platforms except that serving tracks 21 and 22.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} lifts {{and emergency}} {{stairs to the}} platforms were inside the vertex of the V, leading to four <b>passageways,</b> one {{to each of the}} platforms, with return <b>passageways</b> back to the lifts. With growing patronage and increasing congestion the lifts were later replaced by escalators that came into service on 7 October 1929 with an escalator heading from the station building to a circulating area at the northern end of the platforms. This has only two pairs of parallel <b>passageways,</b> one for each branch (northbound), with a small side passage on each leading to the lower southbound platforms. One set of the original lift <b>passageways</b> became part of the ventilation system, but the remaining one adds to the confusion of the station. The west façade was bomb damaged in 1940 and only partially was rebuilt.|$|R
5|$|The inner bailey {{is reached}} using a {{bridge over the}} moat. The {{original}} castle bridge was constructed from wood but this was rebuilt with stone facades and piers in the late medieval period, and then subsequently replaced with an earth bank, further improved in the early 19th century; the current timber bridge dates from the 1960s. A gate house originally protected the entrance, with an arched <b>passageway</b> made from Roman brick, flanked by guardrooms; only the foundations now survive.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} station {{building was}} a temporary structure positioned over {{the tracks and}} the platforms were sheltered with individual awnings rather than the all-over glazed roof provided at the DR's other stations. Access to the station was via a <b>passageway</b> from Bridge Street and a pedestrian subway under the road. On 30 May 1870, the railway was extended to Blackfriars.|$|E
5|$|Between the Octagon and {{the main}} {{gatehouse}} in the north wall was a barbican, of which little survives– {{just a piece of}} the west wall– although the structure was originally two storeys high. The surviving fabric includes a slot for a portcullis for the barbican's north gate, although there are no hinges for gates. The base of a garderobe demonstrates that second storey would have provided space for habitation, probably a guard room. Drawings from the late 18th century show the ground floor of the barbican still standing and includes detail such as vaulting inside the <b>passageway.</b>|$|E

5|$|Communication {{with the}} outside world on the land side was {{maintained}} with the city through two main well-protected city gates, one placed on the western side {{of the city and the}} other placed on the eastern side. These entrances were constructed so that communications with the city could not be carried out directly; the messenger had to enter through multiple doors and walk down a winding <b>passageway,</b> which is evidence of the security measures taken as a last defense against the possibility of a surprise breach or entrance of unexpected visitors.|$|E
5|$|Concentric castles {{were widely}} copied across Europe, for {{instance}} when Edward I of England– who had himself been on Crusade– built castles in Wales {{in the late}} 13thcentury, four of the eight he founded had a concentric design. Not all {{the features of the}} Crusader castles from the 13thcentury were emulated in Europe. For instance, it was common in Crusader castles to have the main gate in the side of a tower and for there to be two turns in the <b>passageway,</b> lengthening the time it took for someone to reach the outer enclosure. It is rare for this bent entrance to be found in Europe.|$|E
