40|$|This thesis {{develops}} {{and demonstrates}} an innovative method for adsorbing metals from metal mine drainage in mid-Wales and northern Italy using dealginated seaweed (DS) as a biosorbent. The chemical composition of 15 mine drainages and two receiving waters in Wales was determined over a two year period {{in relation to}} precipitation and season. The waters were circum-neutral, iron-poor (< 1 mg/L) but metal-rich, dominated by Zn (42 mg/L), Cu (188 ?g/L), Cd (99 ?g/L) and Pb (2. 7 mg/L). The chemical composition varied throughout the year, but did not necessarily show clear seasonal variation, with Zn, Cd and Pb tending to show a winter maximum. The <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>adsorption</b> characteristics of the DS were determined. Over 80...|$|E
40|$|A very {{preliminary}} {{approach for}} grossly tuning the antibacterial activity of cellulosic fibers {{has been developed}} and its preliminary findings are described herein. The approach is universal for cellulosic-based substrates and first involves a <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>adsorption</b> phenomenon between fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) and cellulose. The cellulose biomaterials were {{in the form of}} disks 2 cm in diameter that were subjected to standard agar growth plates containing a gamut of gram positive and gram negative bacteria. Zones of inhibition were measured around the biomaterials which displayed a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. This activity could be tuned simply by grossly changing the surface area of the cellulosic surface topology as indicated by the surface fibrillation of the microfibrils and hence the bioactive availability of the fatty acids. Thus, the potential application of these materials in the biomedical field appears promising...|$|E
40|$|The uptake of arsenate (As(V)) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMAA) by aquatic {{macrophyte}} Spirodela polyrhiza L. {{was investigated}} {{to determine the}} influence of arsenic interaction with PO 43 - and Fe ions. Plants were grown hydroponically on standard Murashige and Skoog (MS) culture solutions. Arsenic concentrations in Fe-oxide (Fe-plaque) on plant surfaces were determined by citrate-bicarbonate-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (CBE) technique. S. polyrhiza L. accumulated 51 -fold arsenic from arsenate solution compared to that from DMAA solution with initial concentrations of 4. 0 and 0. 02 μM of arsenic and phosphate, respectively. The arsenate uptake was negatively (p 0. 05) with iron accumulation. The results suggest that adsorption of arsenate on Fe-plaque of the surface of S. polyrhiza L. contributes to the arsenic uptake significantly. Thus, arsenate uptake in S. polyrhiza L. occurred through the phosphate uptake pathway and by <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>adsorption</b> on Fe-plaques of plant surfaces as well. The S. polyrhiza L. uses different mechanisms for DMAA uptake. © 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. This article has not been published yet...|$|E

30|$|According to the results, mosses {{are able}} to {{concentrate}} heavy metals, {{which is a great}} advantage for urban areas where these species grow naturally and can be used as biomonitors to assess the air pollution level. Trace elements are deposited on the surface of mosses, as dry particulate matter or dissolved material. The heavy metals are retained by <b>adsorption,</b> <b>physico-chemical</b> processes such as ion exchange or passive-active intracellular uptake and {{it has been suggested that}} this latter mechanism is the dominant process in the bryophytes (Onianwa 2001).

40|$|Several N-containing organic {{compounds}} of anthropic origin, namely dyes, pesticides/herbicides and pharmaceuticals, are responsible of water pollution, {{due to their}} high solubility in water and low adsorption in soil, leading to a high mobility in the aquifer. Besides pesticides and dyes, widely recognized as water pollutants, environmental contamination by pharmaceuticals is an emerging issue, since both drugs and their metabolites may act as water pollutants, and most of water potabilization plants do not treat them. Removal of such species by <b>physico-chemical</b> methods (<b>adsorption</b> and coagulation; sedimentation; filtration; use of membranes and chlorination) suffers from several drawbacks, including high operating costs, and formation of secondary pollutants that are then released in the environment. Nonetheless, currently employed biological methods do not allow removing nonbiodegradable pollutants. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), which imply the in situ production of highly reactive species (i. e., H 2 O 2, OH, O− 2, O 3 under relatively mild experimental conditions, allow the degradation (and eventual mineralization to CO 2 and H 2 O) of refractory organics into readily biodegradable compounds and may be used either before or after biological treatments. This review addresses the most common catalytic and photocatalytic AOPs that can be adopted {{for the removal of}} some N-containing compounds of different origin and nature...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePhysico-chemical {{interactions}} between nanoparticles and cell membranes {{play a crucial}} role in determining the cytotoxicity of nanoparticles, which may thereby vary depending on the nature of the target microorganisms. We investigated the responses of two different models of unicellular bacteria to cerium oxide (CeO 2) nanoparticles. These organisms are: Synechocystis PCC 6803 a representative of environmentally important cyanobacterial organisms (producer of biomass for aquatic food chains), and Escherichia coli a representative of intestine-colonizing bacteria. Coupling <b>physico-chemical</b> (<b>adsorption</b> isotherms and electrophoretic mobility), biological (survival tests), microscopical (SEM, TEM and EDS) and spectroscopic (XANES) methods, we enlightened two distinct mechanisms for the CeO 2 nanoparticles toxicological impact: A 'direct' mechanism that requires a close contact between nanoparticles and cell membranes, and an 'indirect' influence elicited by the acidity of nanoparticles stabilizing agents. We showed that E. coli is sensitive to the 'direct' effects of nanoparticles, whereas Synechocystis being protected by extracellular polymeric substances preventing direct cellular contacts is sensitive only to the 'indirect' mechanism. Consequently, our findings demonstrate the importance of the 'direct/indirect' effects of nanoparticles on cell fitness, a phenomenon that should be systematically investigated with appropriate techniques and dose metrics to make meaningful environmental and/or health recommendations...|$|E
40|$|Porous silicon has a {{particularly}} {{large surface area}} available in a limited volume, tens or hundreds of square meters in a cubic centimeter. This attractive property is used to concentrate {{a large number of}} surface reactions (such as <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>adsorption</b> of gases) in a small volume. With a simple and cheap fabrication, the porous silicon is an ideal candidate for gas sensing applications. In this work, new gas sensor architecture in macroporous silicon is presented. The development of this new architecture, based on chemiresistor principle has led to several technological innovations. Three aspects were particularly studied: 1. Integration of miniaturized metal electrode on macroporous silicon to improve the sensitivity of measurement and to enable miniaturization of the sensor. The fabrication process has focused on standard microfabrication techniques to enables the transfer of the sensors to an industrial valorization. 2. A masking technique for localized formation of macroporous silicon to eliminate the mask underetching during the anodization of the porous silicon. 3.

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates the {{possibility}} of using leaf, bark and seed of Moringa stenopetala as alternative adsorbents for removal of Ni(II) from aqueous solutions. The optimum adsorption conditions for removal of Ni(II) were found to be 30, 20 and 50 mg/L initial concentration, 1. 5, 2 and 2. 5 g adsorbent dose, 250, 250 and 300 rpm agitation speed, 90, 120 and 90 min contact time, 40, 30 and 23 o C temperature and pH of 5, 6 and 6 using leaf, bark and seed as adsorbent, respectively. At optimum experimental conditions the percent adsorption of synthetic wastewater sample was found to be 93. 90, 96. 25 and 97. 50 for leaf, bark and seed, respectively. The tested experimental data best fits to pseudo-second order (R 2 > 0. 98) than pseudo-first order, Elovich and intraparticle diffusion kinetic models indicating rate limiting step to be chemisorption. It also fits to Langmuir (R 2 > 0. 895 using adsorbate variation and also R 2 > 0. 998 using both time and temperature variation data) than Freundlich, Temkin and D-R isotherm models. D-R isotherm and thermodynamic study reveals formation of physical adsorption. Hence the adsorption mechanism could be regarded as <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>adsorption</b> process. The adsorption results of industrial wastewater also reveal that for removal of nickel 83 % and 85 % was obtained using bark and seed adsorbents, respectively.

40|$|Different <b>physico-chemical</b> {{properties}} (eg <b>adsorption</b> kinetics, thickness, viscoelasticity, {{and mechanical}} stability) of adsorbed salivary pellicles depend on different factors, including the properties (eg charge, roughness, wettability, and surface chemistry) of the substratum. Whether {{these differences in}} the physico-chemical properties {{are a result of}} differences in the composition or in the organization of the pellicles is not known. In this work, the influence of substratum wettability on the composition of the pellicle was studied. For this purpose, pellicles eluted from substrata of different but well-characterized wettabilities were examined by means of sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The results showed that substratum hydrophobicity did not {{have a major impact on}} pellicle composition. In all substrata, the major pellicle components were found to be cystatins, amylases and large glycoproteins, presumably mucins. In turn, interpretation of previously reported data based on the present results suggests that variations in substratum wettability mostly affect the organization of the pellicle components...|$|R

The technology to obtain active carbons from agricultural crop residues has been developed, active carbon <b>physico-chemical</b> and <b>adsorption</b> properties, textural characteristics have been studied, new functional carbon (nano) materials with antibacterial activity containing (nano) particles of silver have been obtained, their influence within (nano) chip composition on rape crop growth, development and yield has been studied. In the conducted field tests, the highest activity was noted when using the (nano) chip whose structure included RAC - camelina and silver nanoparticles.

The aim of this thesis is an in-depth analysis of the magnetic separation of pollutants from water {{by means of a}} continuous-flow magnetic filter subjected to a field gradient produced by permanent magnets. This technique has the potential to improve times and efficiencies of both urban wastewater treatment plants and drinking water treatment plants.

40|$|The {{adsorption}} of quinoline by Na +- and CaZ+-montmorillonite, llite, and kaolinite {{in water}} suspensions was studied for varying physico-ehemical conditions. The {{shapes of the}} adsorp-tion isotherms depended upon these imposed environmental conditions, which were quino-line concentration, pH, salinity, time, and temperature. In order {{to be in the}} range of concentrations of organic materials in natural waters, these studies covered the concentration range, from 0 to several hundred ppm. Of the variables tudied, pI-I was critical. Throughout he pH range 8. 5 - 6. 0, adsorption i creased as p i t decreased. The change in adsorption as salinity increased epended on pit, clay mineral, and quinoline concentration. In our experiments, amples reached equilibrium within 2 - 3 hr, and moderate temperature changes made little difference in adsorption amounts. Under the same conditions, Na+-montmorfllonite adsorbed the most quinoline, kaolinite the least, and Ca 2 ~-montmorillonite and illite intermediate amounts. Two mechanisms seem to control this adsorption: ion exchange and molecular adsorption.

Batch trials showed these four adsorbents hold 70 - 80 % adsorption efficiency at dose of 0. 5 g, pH 4. 5, and at 35 mg L- 1 of metal concentration. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) explored amine (-NH 2) and hydroxyl (-OH) as a predominant contributor in binding of Cr(III) on to adsorbents biomass.

40|$|A {{significant}} {{challenge in}} large scale industrial production of butanol is its low product titer. Butanol {{needs to be}} purified to higher than 99 % purity {{in order to be}} used for fuel applications. The focus {{of this study is to}} selectively remove water from butanol-water vapor to achieve fuel grade butanol in a pressure swing adsorption (PSA) system using biosorbents developed from agricultural byproduct canola meal (CM). CM was characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) that CM contains polar groups such as hydroxyls, carboxyls, and amines in cellulose, hemi-cellulose and protein that have the potential for water <b>adsorption.</b> <b>Physico-chemical</b> characterizations were also done to understand the major composition, elemental make-up, devolatilization characteristics and particle size distribution of the CM used. The results demonstrated that biosorbent based on CM was able to successfully dry lower grade butanol and generate fuel grade butanol of over 99 v/v%. Five operating parameters were studied at two different levels to get the optimum process conditions for butanol drying, including temperature (95 and 111 °C); pressure (135 and 201 kPa); feed butanol concentration (55 and 95 v/v %); feed flow rate (1. 5 and 3 mL min- 1) and particle size of adsorbent (0. 425 - 1. 18 mm and 4. 7 mm pellets). Orthogonal array design (OAD) tool was used to design experiments and to evaluate the effects of these parameters. The performance of butanol dehydration was evaluated using five indices - water uptake; butanol uptake; water selectivity; butanol recovery; and maximum effluent butanol concentration in the effluent. The results demonstrated that feed butanol concentration, temperature and pressure were found to be the most significant factors overall, affecting most of the indices. The effects of individual operating parameters on each butanol dehydration index were determined and a set of optimum operating conditions were proposed by the range analysis of the orthogonal array design at 111 oC, 135 kPa, feed butanol concentration of 55 v/v%, feed butanol-water liquid flowrate of 3 mL/min and biosorbent particle size of 0. 43 - 1. 18 mm. The experiments conducted at the above mentioned optimum conditions resulted in water uptake of 0. 48 g/g-ads, water selectivity of 5. 4, butanol recovery of 90 %, and the maximum butanol concentration in the effluent being over 99 v/v%, which are better than that obtained at any other conditions investigated in this work. The Dubinin–Polanyi model based on adsorption potential theory displayed a goodness of fit to the water adsorption isotherm data with a r 2 value of 0. 95 and average relative error of just 3. 5 %. The mean free energy determined from the model was 0. 02 kJ/mol indicated the adsorption is physical. Thermodynamic parameters were also evaluated which revealed that the water adsorption is exothermic and spontaneous. Water saturated adsorbent was regenerated at 110 °C under vacuum and reusability was studied. The contribution of two major components of CM namely cellulose and protein were also examined for their capability to selectively remove water from butanol. The results showed both of them were able to dry water, however cellulose was found to have a higher water uptake and water selectivity than protein, indicating that it plays a major role in drying butanol. In order to compare the performance of CM on drying of butanol with other biomaterials, adsorption experiments were done using corn meal as adsorbent, which is one of the most common starch based biosorbents for ethanol drying. The results demonstrated that canola meal had a higher water uptake and water selectivity than corn meal. Use of CM over corn meal adsorbent is also desirable so as to avoid placing pressure on food consumption. In addition, drying of butanol using other cellulose based biosorbents such as oat hull was also explored. Oat hull demonstrated a potential to adsorb water and dehydrate butanol, which requires further in-depth investigation...|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} focuses {{on the fate of}} hydrophobic micropollutants in a membrane bioreactor (MBR) and their removal in it. MBR represents {{one of the most promising}} innovations in the field of wastewater treatment because of the high efficiency in removal of organics and nutrients. The high quality of the effluent is obtained by the complete retention of suspended solids, the almost complete removal of pathogens, and the possibility to increase biodegradation of micropollutants because of the higher sludge retention time in MBR, in comparison to the conventional activated sludge treatment. For the micropollutants which have hydrophobic properties the challenge is to distinguish the real biodegradation from abiotic <b>physico-chemical</b> phenomena like <b>adsorption</b> and volatilisation during the membrane bioreactor treatment. In order to achieve it, the application of radiolabelled hydrophobic model markers is considered to be a powerful technique. In this study the possible fate of NP during wastewater treatment by using a lab-scale MBR was investigated. After a single pulse of the 14 C-labelled-NP isomer (4 -[1 -ethyl- 1, 3 -dimethylpentyl]phenol) as radiotracer, the applied radioactivity was monitored in the MBR system over 34 days. The balance of radioactivity at the end of the study showed that 42 % of the applied radioactivity was recovered in the effluent as degradation products of NP, 21 % was removed with the daily excess sludge from the MBR, and 34 % was recovered as adsorbed in the component parts of the MBR. A high amount of NP was associated to the sludge during the test period, while degradation products were mainly found in the effluent. Partial identification of these metabolites by means of HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry coupled to radio-detection showed that they were alkyl-chain oxidation products of NP. The use of a radiolabelled test compound in a lab-scale MBR was found suitable to demonstrate that the elimination of NP through mineralization and volatilization processes under the applied conditions was negligible (both less than 1 %). However, the removal of NP via sorption and the continuous release of oxidation products of NP in the permeate were highly relevant. The fate of two differently labelled radioactive forms of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE 2), one with the ring and the other one with the ethinyl group labelled was studied during the membrane bioreactor (MBR) process. The system was operated using a synthetic wastewater representative for the pharmaceutical industry and the activated sludge was obtained from a large-scale MBR treating pharmaceutical wastewater. Before the five days radioactive experiment, the activated sludge was adapted for 29 days continuously to non-labelled EE 2. Balancing of radioactivity could demonstrate that mineralization amounted to less than 1 % of the applied radioactivity. The EE 2 residues remained mainly sorbed in the reactor, resulting in a removal of approximately 80 % relative to the concentration in the influent. The same metabolite pattern in the radiochromatograms of the two differently labelled 14 C-EE 2 molecules led to the assumption that the elimination pathway does not involve the removal of the ethinyl group from the EE 2 molecule. The bioaugmentation of membrane bioreactor in order to improve the degradation of recalcitrant nonylphenol during the wastewater treatment was studied. The 14 C-labelled NP isomer 4 -[1 -ethyl- 1, 3 -dimethylpentyl]phenol was applied as single pulse to the membrane bioreactor bioaugmented with the bacterium Sphingomonas sp. strain TTNP 3. The effects of five successive inoculations of the membrane bioreactor with this strain able to degrade NP were investigated in comparison to a non-bioaugmented reactor. Results showed that the radioactivity spiked in the bioaugmented system was retrieved mostly in the effluent (56 %), followed by fractions sorbed to the system (25 %), associated with the excess sludge (9 %) and collected from the gas phase as CO 2 resulting from mineralization (2. 3 %). The degradation products identified in the treated effluent and in the MLSS were specific metabolites of catabolism of the NP by Sphingomonas, e. g. hydroquinone resulting from ipso-substitution. The capacity of this bacterium to excrete biosurfactants and to increase nonylphenol bioavailability was investigated.
