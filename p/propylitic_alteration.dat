50|$|Intrusive volcanics form much of {{the exposed}} complex. In Bayo de la Alumbrera, a dacite complex is {{embedded}} within pyroclastic rocks and trachyandesites. Bayo de la Alumbrera was originally buried beneath a 2500 m high volcanic pile. Around the Alto de la Blenda monzonite a number of stocks (0.1 - 1 km wide) and dikes originate, which indicates {{it may be a}} remnant of the conduit. In some stocks magma mixing appears to have occurred during formation; in Alto de la Alumbrera first felsic and at the end mafic rocks were formed. Several dykes and stocks were injected into andesite during the formation of Bajo de la Alumbrera. Many of these stocks have suffered hydrothermal alteration extending into surrounding rocks shortly after their formation including <b>propylitic</b> <b>alteration,</b> but the later stocks show no evidence of alteration. This pattern probably occurred because strong volcanic activity during the earliest intrusions did leak away fluids before they could trigger alteration. When volcanic activity dropped, trapped fluids could then initiate hydrothermal alteration. This probably coincided with a change in the local stress regime that reduced volcanic activity. Faults and fractures have influenced the alteration. In Bajo de la Alumbrera, this alteration has given place to magnetite and anhydrite inclusions which indicated the rocks were highly oxidized. Phyllic (pyrite-quartz-sericite) and potassic (biotite-orthoclase) alteration is noticeable in satellite images of Bajo de la Alumbrera. Agua Rica, another exposed deposit, is cut by the Quebradas Mina valley. It is subdivided in the Seca and Trampeadero porphyries. Two diatremes are also found, one of which is named El Espanto.|$|E

The main {{objective}} is to obtain the metallogenetic map of the area located between S 290 to S 300 and W 690 to W 70030 ´, in the NW of San Juan Province, Argentina. Taking advantages of high spatial resolution and the wide spectral range of ASTER data, alteration zones are identified, also its distribution and gold epithermal mineralization relationships. Tertiary volcanism of Valle del Cura region belongs to the physical continuity of Chilean tertiary stratigraphy and volcanism, which include the Cerro Tórtolas Formation and the Tilito and Escabroso formations from Doña Ana Group. These units form the El Indio-Maricunga Belt, which overlaid the basement integrated with Permian Triassic volcanic rocks and granitoids and other carboniferous rocks. There are three main structural systems: NS, WNW and NNE. In the intersection of these lineaments with WNW structures, are located the regional eruptive-explosive complexes like Cerro Veladero, Cerro Colorado and Cerro Pelado. It was extracted the digital elevation model (DEM) from 25 ASTER stereo data to orthorectify the images, then they were mosaiked.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to use {{airborne}} imaging spectrometer data to discriminate hydrothermal alteration mineral assemblages associated with silver and gold mineralization at Virginia City, NV. The data is corrected for vertical striping and sample gradients, and converted to flat-field logarithmic residuals. Log residual spectra from areas known to be altered are compared to field spectra for kaolinitic, illitic, sericitic, and <b>propylitic</b> <b>alteration</b> types. The areal distributions of these alteration types are estimated using a spectral matching technique. Both visual examination of spectra and the matching techniques are effective in distinguishing kaolinitic, illitic, and <b>propylitic</b> <b>alteration</b> types from each other. However, illitic and sericitic alteration cannot be separated using these techniques because the spectra of illite and sericite are very similar.

The district comprises four porphyry deposits (Ridgeway, Cadia Quarry, Cadia Hill, and Cadia East) and two iron–copper–gold skarn deposits (Big Cadia and Little Cadia). Almost 1, 000 tonnes of contained gold and more than four million tonnes of copper have been discovered in these systems, making Cadia the world’s largest known alkalic porphyry district, in terms of contained gold. Porphyry gold–copper ore at Cadia is associated with quartz monzonite intrusive complexes, and is hosted by central stockwork and sheeted quartz–sulfide– (carbonate) vein systems. The Cadia porphyry deposits are characterized by cores of potassic and/or calc–potassic alteration assemblages, and peripheral halos of <b>propylitic</b> <b>alteration,</b> with late-stage phyllic alteration mostly restricted to fault zones. Hematite dusting {{is an important component}} of the <b>propylitic</b> <b>alteration</b> assemblage, and has produced a distinctive reddening of feldspar minerals in the volcanic wall rocks around the mineralized centers. Sulfide mineralization is strongly zoned at Ridgeway and Cadia East, with bornite-rich cores surrounded by chalcopyrite-rich halos and peripheral zones of pyrite mineralization. The Cadia Hill and Cadia Quarry deposits have chalcopyrite-rich cores and pyrite-rich halos, and Cadia Hill contains a high-level bornite-rich zone. Distinctive sulfur isotopic zonation patterns have been identified at Ridgeway, Cadia Hill, and Cadia East. The deposit cores are characterized by low δ 34 Ssulfide values (− 10 to − 4 ‰), consistent with sulfide precipitation from an oxidized (sulfate-predominant) magmatic fluid at 450 to 400 °C. Pyrite grains that occur in the <b>propylitic</b> <b>alteration</b> halos typically have δ 34 Ssulfide values near 0 ‰. There is a gradual increase in δ 34 Ssulfide values outwards from the deposit cores through the propylitic halos. Water–rock interaction during <b>propylitic</b> <b>alteration</b> caused magmatic sulfate reduction and concomitant oxidation of ferrous iron-bearing minerals, resulting in enrichment of 34 S in pyrite and also producing the distinctive reddened, hematite-rich alteration halos to the Cadia deposits.

40|$|International audienceThe Linares deposit is an intrusion-hosted {{gold deposit}} {{located in the}} NW of the Iberian Variscan Belt. The igneous rocks hosting the ore are the Linares adamellite and the Arganzúa leucogranite. They are high-K, calc-alkaline and {{slightly}} peraluminous post-collisional igneous rocks, a mixture of I- and S-types, the Arganzúa leucogranite representing a late-stage fractionated phase. The intrusions have a reduced to intermediate oxidation state which spans {{the boundary between the}} ilmenite and magnetite series. The gold mineralization occurs disseminated or along a network of microfractures and veins of variable size, commonly in sheeted vein array. The alteration observed includes both potassic, with K-feldspar and secondary biotite developed mainly in the Arganzúa leucogranite, and sericitic and <b>propylitic</b> <b>alterations.</b> A sericite–chlorite–carbonate alteration, related to hairline fractures, is broadly distributed but rarely pervasive. Wolfram-bearing mineralization is followed by sulphide precipitation, mainly pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, pyrite, arsenopyrite, molybdenite and galena, with minor löllingite and sphalerite. Gold is commonly associated with Bi–Te-bearing minerals with Bi/Te(S + Se) ≥ 1, consistent with a pyrrhotite-buffered environment. This is reflected in the strong correlation observed between Au and Bi. The fluids involved in the sulphide precipitation are aqueous-carbonic (CO 2 and ± CH 4), with low salinity (0. 5 – 6. 3 wt. % NaCl eq.) and variable amounts of other volatiles (N 2 and H 2 S). The fluid inclusion study registered an adiabatic drop from a lithostatic pressure of 1. 8 – 2. 6 kbar to a hydrostatic pressure of 0. 3 – 0. 9 kbar, at temperatures of 300 – 400 °C. The fault-valve phenomena could explain the pressure drop producing a volatile release from an early CO 2 -rich fluid. A later trapped fluid with a wide-ranging CO 2 /CH 4 ratio suggests an isothermal mixture with a CH 4 (± N 2) -rich fluid external to the granitoid (metamorphic). The effervescence and the fluid-mixing could be the possible mechanisms of ore precipitation in this system. The Linares deposit presents a number of features in common with intrusion-related gold deposits elsewhere in Phanerozoic orogenic belts.

40|$|International audienceThe Archean granitoids in the Kiéné area, Gabon, are overlained by the Paleoproterozoic sediments of the Franceville basin (2. 1 Ga). The basin {{is known}} for its {{high-grade}} uranium deposits among which some have been forming natural nuclear fission reactors. Most of the studies were dedicated to the FA-FB Paleoproterozoic sediments hosting these uranium deposits. Little is known on the Archean basement itself and specifically on the hydrous alteration events it experienced before and after the sediment deposition. The present work is focused on their petrographical, mineralogical and geochemical characterization. Dating the successive alteration events has been attempted on altered monazite crystals. Rocks in different alteration states have been sampled from eight drill cores crosscutting the Archean - Paleoproterozoic unconformity. The Archean granitoids observed in the deepest levels exhibit typical petrographical features of a <b>propylitic</b> <b>alteration</b> while they are intensely illitized up to the unconformity. The <b>propylitic</b> <b>alteration</b> is mainly pervasive but the original texture of the granitoïds is conserved in spite of the formation of new minerals: Mg-chlorite, allanite and epidote forming a typical paragenesis. The illitic alteration is much more invasive near the unconformity. The illitization process leads to the replacement of feldspars and the corrosion of quartz crysals by an illitic matrix while the ferromagnesian minerals are pseudomorphosed by a Fe-chlorite + phengite + hematite assemblage. The final fluid-rock interaction step is marked by fissural deposits of calcite and anhydrite. The δ 13 C isotopic data show that the fissural carbonates precipitated from diagenetic fluids enriched carbon products deriving from the maturation of organic matter. The U-Pb isotopic analyzes performed on monazite crystals have dated three distinct events: 3. 0 - 2. 9 Ga (magmatic), 2. 6 Ga (<b>propylitic</b> <b>alteration)</b> and 1. 9 Ga (diagenetic illitization). The calculation of geochemical mass balances suggests that the water-rock ratio during the <b>propylitic</b> <b>alteration</b> event was weak. On the contrary, it was much higher during the overprinted illitization which is characterized by an intense leaching of Na, Ca, Mg, Sr, REE and an enrichment in K, Rb,Cs. Neither the petrographic features nor the geochemical data militate for an Archean weathering event (paleosol). In the present case, diagenetic fluids have percolated from the unconformity into the basement where they overprinted the illitization processes upon the previously propylitized rocks. These fluids were probably oxidant as they are also responsible of the U mobilization which {{led to the formation of}} the ore deposits close to the FA-FB interface...|$|E

30|$|These models {{commonly}} {{involve a}} silica-rich zone (vuggy silica), with accompanying aluminous hydrous sheet silicate minerals (kaolin and pyrophyllite) and alunite (advanced argillic alteration zone, lithocap) {{in the center}} top of a system. As applied to the porphyry copper model (Sillitoe 2010), the silica–pyrite, silica–pyrite ± alunite ± kaolin, and silica–pyrophyllite zones are correlated with vuggy residual quartz/silicification, quartz–alunite and quartz–kaolinite zones, and the quartz–pyrophyllite zone, respectively. The association including K-feldspar implies hydrothermal alteration at near-neutral conditions, which can occur at different locations in hydrothermal systems. Some studies on volcanoes have found that neutralization of hydrothermal fluid tends to progress outward from the silicic core (vuggy silica alteration zone) through advanced argillic and argillic zones to <b>propylitic</b> <b>alteration</b> zones (Mt Shimokura: Ohba and Kitade 2005; Mt Rainier: John et al. 2008) by analogy to the zonation in geothermal areas and epithermal ore fields (e.g., Henley and Ellis 1983; Kimbara 1983; Stoffregen 1987; Heald et al. 1987; Hedenquist et al. 2000). In those contexts, the <b>propylitic</b> <b>alteration</b> zone represents near-neutral conditions. On the other hand, neutralization in porphyry copper systems occurs below the advanced argillic alteration zone, and this type of alteration {{is referred to as}} potassic alteration (Giggenbach 1997; Sillitoe 2010). The paragenesis of alkali feldspar and hydrothermal biotite in the volcanic ash indicates high-temperature neutralization. This seems more likely to reflect the potassic alteration typical of porphyry copper systems, rather than neutralization at low temperature to form <b>propylitic</b> <b>alteration</b> that accompanies chlorite precipitation (Giggenbach 1997). According to the geologic models for porphyry copper systems, the potassic zone is located under the advanced argillic alteration zone (Giggenbach 1997; Sillitoe 2010). The Ontake volcanic ash contains few grains indicating the K-feldspar-bearing alteration (colloform texture) that potentially represents low-temperature conditions typical of epithermal ore deposits (Fournier 1985; Saunders 1990). The low-temperature neutral alteration might be locally distributed at shallow levels. The common occurrence of the silica-muscovite association supports a correlation between the volcanic ash and deep-seated neutral zones. In porphyry copper models, this association can be correlated with the sericite zone located between the silica-pyrophyllite zone and the potassic zone. We conclude that the volcanic ash of the 2014 Ontake eruption was derived from the magmatic-hydrothermal system that correlated well with the models for the porphyry copper system.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The Baturappe {{prospect}} {{situated in}} southernmost part of Sulawesi island, Indonesia, is a hydrothermal mineralization district which {{is characterized by}} occurrences of epithermal silver-base metal mineralizations. The mineralizations hosted in basaltic-andesitic volcanic rocks of the late Middle-Miocene Baturappe Volcanics. This paper discusses {{a recent study of}} relationships between alteration mineralogy and whole-rock geochemistry, which focused on elemental mass balance calculation, of the hydrothermal alteration zones within the prospect. Hydrothermal alteration is zoned around the mineralizations from proximal quartz-carbonate and illite-quartz (argillic) to vein-related propylitic (epidote-chlorite-calcite) to distal-district <b>propylitic</b> (chlorite) <b>alteration.</b> Mass balance calculation indicates that in the vein-related propylitic altered zone there is a little decrease in bulk composition of the altered rock with respect to the least-altered rock.

The gains and losses of the major oxides and trace elements in the both alteration zones are generally consistent either with the hydrothermal alteration mineral assemblages of each alteration zone, indications of the hydrothermal alteration processes such as destruction of primary minerals and absorption of certain elements in altered minerals, and the behaviours of early metal-bearing sulphides...|$|R
40|$|The Qulong {{porphyry}} {{copper and}} molybdenum deposit {{is located at}} the southwest margin of the Lhasa Terrane and in the eastern region of the Gangdese magmatic belt. It represents China’s largest porphyry copper system, with ∼ 2200 million tonnes of ore comprising 0. 5 % Cu and 0. 03 % Mo. The mineralization is associated with Miocene granodiorite, monzogranite and quartz-diorite units, which intruded into Jurassic volcanic units in a post-collisional (Indian-Asian) tectonic setting. Field observations and core logging demonstrate the alteration and mineralization at Qulong are akin to typical porphyry copper systems in subduction settings, which comprise similar magmatic-hydrothermal, potassic, <b>propylitic</b> and phyllic <b>alteration</b> assemblages. Molybdenite Re-Os geochronology confirms the relative timeframe defined by field observations and core logging and indicates that the bulk copper and molybdenum at Qulong were deposited within 350, 000 years: between 16. 10 [*]±[*] 0. 06 [0. 08] (without and with decay constant uncertainty) and 15. 88 [*]±[*] 0. 06 [0. 08] Ma. This duration for mineralization is in direct contrast to a long-lived intrusive episode associated with mineralization based on previous zircon U-Pb data. Our fluid inclusion study indicates that the ore-forming fluid was oxidized and contained Na, K, Ca, Fe, Cu, Mo, Cl and S. The magmatic-hydrothermal transition occurred at ∼ 425 °C under lithostatic pressure, while potassic, <b>propylitic</b> and phyllic <b>alteration</b> occurred at hydrostatic pressure with temperature progressively decreasing from 425 to 280 °C.

Several IOCG {{deposits}} such as Tanourjeh Au-bearing magnetite deposit and Kuh-e-Zar Specularite-rich Au deposit have been explored in KKBB. Geology, alteration, mineralization, geochemistry and fluid inclusion results in Kashmar suggest the IOCG type Au-bearing magnetite mineralization. These IOCG deposits at KKBB form at an active continental arc related to SSZ-type Sabzevar oceanic subduction. Materials and methods Use of Landsat 7 +, IRS and Aster satellites. Petrography and alteration Studies in 150 thin sections of volcanic and intrusive rocks. Sampling of ore-bearing quartz vein and mineralography. Preparation of 28 geochemistry samples by the chip composite method of ore-bearing quartz vein and analyzing them in the ACME laboratory by Aqua Regia 1 DX 1. Fluid inclusions studies of 14 samples of quartz and barite related to the ore minerals of ore-bearing quartz vein by THM 600 stage of Linkam company. Results Magmatic events in Kashmar occur at Paleocene-Eocene and include: (1) old mafic - intermediate volcano-plutonic series; (2) felsic volcanic and granitoids; and (3) parallel swarm dykes which are youngest (Almasi et al., 2016). Geochemically, Kashmar rocks are metaluminous to highly peraluminous and Tholeitic to calc-alkaline and shoshonitic in composition (Almasi et al., 2016). The field characteristics, together with isotope and geochemical analyses show that all rock types are essentially co-magmatic and post-collisional I-type (Almasi et al., 2016). Alteration of Kashmar is described in two ways: (1) intense ellipsoidal-linear Argillic-Sillicification and low sericitic with Silica caps and with medium widespread and <b>propylitic</b> <b>alterations</b> in triple regions, next to Dorouneh fault; and (2) Medium Hematite-Carbonate-Chlorite-Silicification alterations in Kamarmard heights. In parts of near the Doruneh fault, sometimes fractures of rocks are filled with tourmaline (Dumortierite type) and iron oxides. Kashmar surface mineralization is described in the ore-bearing quartz veins. Principal mineralization textures are layered, comb and Brecciation. The most important types of veins are those containing Chalcopyrite - Quartz veins, Specularite-rich veins – Quartz-Galena veins accompany with hydrothermal Breccias. Barren barite veins also exist in the region. The Chalcopyrite - Quartz veins occur on the main fracture zone and next to the Argillic alterations and silica cap in three regions (Bahariyeh, Uch Palang and Sarsefidal).

40|$|Graduation date: 1988 The Seaman Gulch area {{is located}} {{approximately}} 20 {{miles east of}} Redding, California and {{is part of the}} eastern Klamath lithotectonic belt. Rock units of the area are chiefly mafic and silicic volcanics of island arc affinity and shale that are Permian to Triassic in age. Volcanic rocks of Tertiary and Quaternary age unconformably overlie the pre-Tertiary rocks. All pre-Tertiary rocks have been altered by hydro-thermal and(or) metamorphic processes. Stratabound epigenetic mineralization is hosted by metadacitic pyroclastics of the Bully Hill Rhyolite. The hypogene sulfide minerals present are pyrite, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, tetrahedrite-tennantite and galena. Minor amounts of supergene chalcocite are found. These sulfides occur as disseminations, stringer veinlets, massive pods and an irregular network around pyroclastic fragments. Controls that localized the occurrences of sulfides are intrusive rock-country rock contacts, permeability and porosity of pyroclastic rocks, faults, and fractures. The gangue mineralogy of the stringer veinlets consists of quartz, carbonate, and anhydrite. The distribution of sulfide minerals is zoned vertically and from bottom to top as follows: pyrite - chalcopyrite as disseminations and stringer veinlets; pyrite - sphalerite - chalcopyrite as disseminations, stringer veinlets, and networks; and pyrite - sphalerite - chalcopyrite - tetrahedrite-tennantite - galena as disseminations, stringer veinlets, and massive pods. Hydrothermal alteration assemblages are chloritic alteration, quartz - white mica alteration, <b>propylitic</b> <b>alteration,</b> silicification, argillic alteration, and carbonate alteration. These alteration assemblages display both vertical and lateral zonations. A central zone of chloritic alteration grades laterally into <b>propylitic</b> <b>alteration,</b> and upward into quartz-white mica alteration. The quartz - white mica alteration in turn grades laterally into <b>propylitic</b> <b>alteration.</b> Argillic alteration and carbonate alteration are genetically related but slightly later events that overprint the earlier assemblages. The mineralization in the Seaman Gulch area is similar to the stockwork zone that underlies Kuroko-type volcano-genic massive sulfide deposits. The sulfides and their associated products of hydrothermal alteration were deposited during submarine geothermal activity that was operative during the latest Permian time. The economic potential of the Seaman Gulch area is considered to be low because of the paucity of base metalbearing sulfides, their occurrence as chiefly disseminations and veinlets, and the restricted distribution of economic assays...|$|E

The Sarcheshmeh deposit {{belongs to the}} southeastern part of Urumieh-Dokhtar magmatic assemblage (i. e., Dehaj-Sarduyeh zone). Intrusion of Sarcheshmeh granodiorite stock in faulted and thrusted early-Tertiary volcano-sedimentary deposits, led to mineralization in Miocene. In this research, the mass changes and element mobilities during hydrothermal process of potassic alteration were studied relative to fresh rock from the deeper parts of the plutonic body, phyllic relative to potassic, argillic relative to phyllic and <b>propylitic</b> <b>alteration</b> relative to fresh andesites surrounding the deposit. In the potassic zone, enrichment in Fe 2 O 3 and K 2 O is so clear, because of increasing Fe coming from biotite alteration and presence of K-feldspar, respectively. Copper and molybdenum enrichments resulted from presence of chalcopyrite, bornite and molybdenite mineralization in this zone. Enrichment of SiO 2 and depletion of CaO, MgO, Na 2 O and K 2 O in the phyllic zone resulted from leaching of sodium, calcium and magnesium from the aluminosilicate rocks and alteration of K-feldspar to sericite and quartz. In the argillic zone, Al 2 O 3, CaO, MgO, Na 2 O and MnO have also been enriched in which increasing Al 2 O 3 may be from kaolinite and illite formation.

This mine is {{situated}} within Khaf-Bardascan volcanic plutonic belt. Based on recent exploration along this belt, several IOCG type system plus Kuh-e-Zar deposit are discovered. In the study area, several type of tuff and lava having acid to intermediate composition are identified (upper Eocene). Oligo-Miocene granite, granodiorite, synogranite and monzonite intruded upper Eocene andesite-dacite-rhyolite. Intrusive rocks are meta-aluminous, medium to high-K series I-type. Based on spider diagram, intrusive rocks show enrichment in LILE = K, Th, Rb and depletion in HFSE = Nb, Sr, Ti. Based geochemistry of igneous rock, they formed in continental margin subduction zone. <b>Propylitic</b> (chlorite) <b>alteration</b> is dominated and covers large area. Silicification is restricted only to mineralized zones. Argillic and albitization {{is found in}} certain location and cover small areas. The style of mineralization was controlled by the type and geometry of fault zones. Mineralization is found as vein, stockwork and breccias. Hypogene mineral Paragenesis include: specularite-quartz-gold-chlorite ± chalcopyrite ± pyrite ± galena ± barite. Secondary minerals formed due to oxidation are: goethite, limonite, lepidocrucite, Malachite, Azurite, Covelite, Cerucite, hydrocerucite, Pyrolusite and Smitsonite. In a few localities, chalcopyrite and minor pyrite and galena are found. Based on SEM analysis gold is present as electrum. Mineralization appeared in different type such as vein, stockwork and Hydrothermal breccia in strike sleep fault zone which are hidden inside volcano plutonic rocks. The average gold grade is between 3. 02 ppm and ore reserve is estimated more than 3 million tons (cut off grade = 0. 7 ppm). ...|$|R

Fluid inclusions found in variably deformed quartz segregations associated with propylitic (chlorite + epidote + clinozoisite + albite + maguetite t pyrite) and phyllic (quartz + sericite + pyrite) altera-tion assemblages record a minimum temperature of 335 'C for the associated PGE mineralization. Types of fluid inclu-sions include, in chronological order of trapping, N 2, CO 2 (tH 2 O) and H 2 O-NaCl-CaCl 2. The latter inclusions have been separated iilo high-salinity and low-salinity subgroups. The close temporal and spatial association of high-salinity H 2 O-NaCl-CaCl 2 fluid inclusions with <b>propylitic</b> and phyllic <b>alteration</b> assemblages supports PGE transport as chloride complexes.

The pyrite halo that surrounds porphyry deposits typically extends part way through the propylitic halo, and provides strong responses to conventional geochemical and geophysical exploration techniques. When exploring outside of the pyrite halo, porphyry deposits {{have proven to be}} difficult to detect based simply on the presence of weak epidote-chlorite alteration. Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) analyses of epidote from <b>propylitic</b> <b>alteration</b> zones around porphyry and skarn deposits in the central Baguio district, Philippines, have shown that low-level hypogene geochemical dispersion halos can be detected at considerably greater distances than can be achieved by conventional rock chip sampling of altered rocks. Epidote chemistry can provide vectoring information to the deposit center and potentially provides insights into the potential metal endowment of the porphyry system, providing explorers with both vectoring and fertility assessment tools. Epidote chemistry varies with respect to distance from porphyry deposit centers, with the highest concentrations of proximal pathfinder elements (e. g., Cu, Mo, Au, Sn) detected in epidote from close to the potassic alteration zone. Distal pathfinder elements (e. g., As, Sb, Pb, Zn, Mn) are most enriched in epidote more than 1. 5 km from the deposit center. Rare earth elements and Zr are most enriched in epidote {{from the edge of the}} pyrite halo. The lateral zonation in epidote chemistry implies that at Baguio the geochemical dispersion patterns were produced by lateral outflow of spent fluids from the porphyry center, rather than from ingress of peripheral, non-magmatic waters...|$|E

Previous work in the Kiene region investigated the nature of the fluids responsible for these natural nuclear reactors. The present work focuses {{on the top of the}} Archaean granitic basement, specifically, to identify and date the successive alteration events that affected this basement just below the unconformity separating it from the Palaeoproterozoic basin. Core from four drill holes crosscutting the basin-basement unconformity have been studied. Dating is based on U-Pb isotopic analyses performed on monazite. The origin of fluids is discussed from the study of fluid inclusion planes (FIP) in quartz from basement granitoids. From the deepest part of the drill holes to the unconformable boundary with the basin, <b>propylitic</b> <b>alteration</b> assemblages are progressively replaced by illite and locally by a phengite + Fe chlorite Fe oxide assemblage. Illitic alteration is particularly strong along the sediment-granitoid contact and is associated with quartz dissolution. It was followed by calcite and anhydrite precipitation as fracture fillings. U-Pb isotopic dating outlines three successive events: a 3. 0 - 2. 9 -Ga primary magmatic event, a 2. 6 -Ga <b>propylitic</b> <b>alteration</b> and a late 1. 9 -Ga diagenetic event. Fluid inclusion microthermometry suggests the circulation of three types of fluids: (I) a Na-Ca-rich diagenetic brine, (2) a moderately saline (diagenetic + meteoric) fluid, and (3) a low-salinity fluid of probable meteoric origin. These fluids are similar to those previously identified within the overlying sedimentary rocks of the Franceville basin. Overall, the data collected in this study show that the Proterozoic-Archaean unconformity has operated as a major flow corridor for fluids circulation, around 1. 9 G...|$|E
40|$|Copperstone is a mid-Tertiary "detachment gold" deposit that is herein {{classified}} as a new subtype of epithermal deposit. Copperstone is similar to many active geothermal systems in terms of host lithology, temperature, and related siliceous alteration mineralogy, except in the hypogene oxide assemblages, the high salinity, {{and the lack of}} sulfides and the pathfinder toxic elements. The host rock is mainly Jurassic quartz latite porphyry and Tertiary sedimentary breccias. Early stages of alteration were K-metasomatic and <b>propylitic,</b> and <b>alteration</b> that accompanied gold mineralization was mainly chloritization and silicification. Mineralization is structurally controlled and is restricted along the Copperstone Listric Fault with minor mineralization along high-angle NE and NW faults, as with many other deposits in west-central Arizona. The gold stage of mineralization was superimposed on previously K-metasomatized rocks. Hypogene mineralization can be divided into 3 paragenetic stages: early amethyst-quartz-Fe-rich-chlorite-specularite-hematite-Au° of stage C; late-stage fine-grained euhedral quartz-adularia-chrysocolla ± malachite ± magnetite ± chalcopyrite-pink fluorite-barite-ankerite-calcite-Au° of stage D; and barren quartz-pale green fluorite-barite-calcite-hematite of stage E. Gold occurs as free particles or is encapsulated in amethyst and late fine-grained euhedral quartz. The time of mineralization is Miocene or younger and the depth of mineralization was 1 Km. Gold mineralization was related to boiling such that a hot spring system did operate at Copperstone. Copperstone is a hydrothermal system created during the last stages of detachment faulting, with mineralization controlled by boiling, and "second boiling" was the principal trigger of Copperstone gold deposition in an environment of falling temperatures and pressures on chloride-rich brine fluids. Variation in δ³⁴S indicates that two different fluids are involved in this system, and that a deeper, "lighter" hydrothermal fluid mixed with a "heavier" basin brine. δ¹⁸O values from carbonates confirm the extent of isotopic exchange with an aqueous reservoir and indicates that oxidation accompanied gold deposition...|$|R

This prospect comprises a broad N-S, subvertical mineralized envelope formed in a synvolcanic fault-related environment. This envelope is at least 300 m long, up to 30 m wide, and is known to a depth of 950 m, where it remains open. It exhibits two contrast-ing mineralized zones that are representative of the varying styles of mineralization in the area. The Auriferous zone consists of both ubiquitous pyrite disseminations and Au-bearing silicate-sulfide veins in strongly fractured intrusive, effusive, and volcaniclastic rocks showing <b>propylitic</b> and chloritic <b>alteration</b> assemblages. The Polyme-tallic zone, on the other hand, is characterized by discrete, Cu-Ag-Au−rich magnetite-sulfide veins and lesser pyrite disseminations within distal propylitic and proximal potassic to sodic alteration zones.

Several lines of evidence, including the spatial distribution pattern and nature of the alteration and mineraliza-tion assemblages, metal associations, mass-balance calculations, pyrite composition, and crosscutting relation-ships are indicative of a preregional deformation, synvolcanic origin for the hydrothermal activity.

Most of the springs in the study area surface out from the boundary between fractured aquifer (silicified zone) and impervious boundary (argillic zone). This study focuses on two such springs in KirazlI area (KirazlI and Balaban springs) with a distinct quality pattern. Accordingly, field parameters (temperature, pH, and electrical conductivity), major anion and cation (sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chloride, bicarbonate, and sulfate), heavy metals (aluminum, arsenic, barium, chromium, cobalt, cupper, iron, lithium, manganese, nickel, lead, and zinc), and isotopes (oxygen- 18, deuterium, and tritium) were determined in water samples taken from these springs during 2005 through 2007. The chemical analyses showed that aluminum concentrations were found to be two orders of magnitude greater in KirazlI waters (mean value 13813. 25 μg/L). The levels of this element exceeded the maximum allowable limits given in national and international standards for drinking-water quality. In addition, Balaban and KirazlI springs are > 55 years old according to their tritium levels; KirazlI spring is older than Balaban spring. KirazlI spring is also more enriched than Balaban spring based in oxygen- 18 and deuterium values. Furthermore, KirazlI spring water has been in contact with altered rocks longer than Balaban spring water, according to its relatively high chloride and electrical conductivity values. TÜBİTA...|$|R
40|$|Southern Peru {{contains}} important epithermal Au-Ag (+/- base metals) deposits, such as Canahuire, Tucari, Santa Rosa, Caylloma, Shila and Paula. The Chapi Chiara gold prospect {{is located}} in this region and {{is part of a}} paleo-stratovolcano of the Upper Miocene-Pliocene. The hydrothermal alteration of the prospect was characterized based on spectroradiometric data, geochemistry and petrography. The mineralogical data, interpreted based on reflectance spectroscopy, were spatialized using the sequential indicator simulation technique for producing probabilistic maps of alteration. The inner part of the paleo-stratovolcano (SW sector) is marked by three main cores of advanced argillic alteration (AAA) (quartz-alunite supergroup minerals-kaolinite-dickite +/- topaz +/- pyrophyllite +/- diaspore) associated with topographic highs. The AAA 1 core is surrounded by argillic alteration (quartz-illite-paragonitic illite-smectite +/- pyrite) and <b>propylitic</b> <b>alteration</b> (quartz-plagioclase-chlorite-calcite-epidote-smectite +/- kaolinite +/- pyrite +/- chalcopyrite +/- magnetite). The central sector of the prospect, situated in the NE flank of the paleo-stratovolcano, is characterized by hydrothermal breccias structured towards N 65 E. The main mineral phases comprise quartz and abundant pyrite, sometimes with traces of As. Anomalous geochemical values of Ag, As, Bi, Hg, Se, Sb and Te coincide with high gold contents in this sector of the prospect Jarosite and goethite are evidence of a subsequent supergene event. Based on the mineralogical characterization, we conclude the existence of a high sulfidation epithermal system in Chapi Chiara. Hypogene minerals of higher temperature in the SW sector of the prospect, such as diaspore, pyrophyllite and topaz in the AAA zone, and epidote in the <b>propylitic</b> <b>alteration</b> zone, can reveal that the system is currently in a relatively deep erosion level, suggesting its proximity in relation to the interface between a deep epithermal system and a mesothermal system.

Ardestan is located in part of Central Iranian Volcanic Belt that hosts many well-known porphyry copper deposits. This research investigated the <b>propylitic</b> and argillic <b>alteration</b> zones and outer mineralogy zone in part of Ardestan region. The two mentioned approaches were applied to discriminate alteration zones from igneous bedrock using the major absorption of indicator minerals from alteration and mineralogy zones in spectral rang of ASTER bands.

These high levels of Al were found to exceed the maximum allowable limits (0. 2 ppm) depicted in national and international standards of drinking water quality. Therefore, the effect of high Al in water resources on human health was evaluated in this research. A total of 273 people aged above 18 years and living in the Kirazli region (whose water supply is from springs emerging from these alteration zones) and in the Ciplak-Halileli region (whose water supply is provided from an alluvium aquifer) were selected as the research group. For this group, a questionnaire was completed that contained questions on descriptive characteristics of humans and a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was administered by the authors using the face-to-face interview technique. A neurological examination was then performed by the neurology specialist as a second-stage investigation. Finally, 10 ml of venous blood samples were obtained from these people as a third-stage analysis to determine the serum Al levels together with vitamin B 12, folic acid, and thyroid-stimulating hormone parameters. The result typically revealed that the MMSE score was less in 31. 9 % and there was no statistically significant difference between the two regions. However, the result also showed that neuropathy in the history (including a careful past medical history) was significantly higher in the Kirazli region. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.
