The field of GRB 100418 A was observed with FOCAS on Subaru 8. 2 m telescope under a <b>photometric</b> <b>condition</b> (seeing 0. 3 "- 0. 4 ") on 2010 May 14 (UT). The date corresponds to 25. 6 days after the burst trigger (15. 8 days in the restframe). We did imaging observations in V, Rc, and Ic bands, and two hours of spectrophotometric observations. We got the resolved host galaxy image which elongated 1. 6 " (= 11 kpc) from north to south. No point source was detected on the host galaxy. The time variation of Rc-band magnitude shows that the afterglow of GRB 100418 A has faded to Rc ∼ > 24 without SN like rebrightening, when we compare our measurement to the reports in GCN circulars. We could not identify any SN feature such as broad emission-lines or bumps in our spectrum. Assuming the SN is fainter than the 3 σ noise spectrum of our observation, we estimate the upper limit on the SN absolute magnitude MIc,obs > - 17. 2 in observer frame Ic-band. This magnitude is comparable to the faintest type Ic SNe. We also estimate host galaxy properties from the spectrum. The host galaxy of GRB 100418 A is relatively massive (log M_star/M_sun = 9. 54) compared to typical long GRB host galaxies, and has 12 +log(O/H) = 8. 75.

The zenith-corrected values are 21. 98, 22. 81, 21. 81, 20. 82 and 19. 78 mag/arcsec^ 2 in U, B, V R and I, respectively. In <b>photometric</b> <b>conditions,</b> the sky background is ~ 0. 1 mag/arcsec^ 2 higher than the median when observing toward Tucson and Phoenix but it may be up to ~ 0. 5 mag/arcsec^ 2 higher in non-photometric conditions. The sky at Mt. Graham is ~ 0. 32 mag/arcsec^ 2 brighter at airmass ~ 1. 4 than at zenith but no significant trend was found with the time of the night. We demonstrated the dependence of the sky background at Mt. Graham on the solar activity for the first time. In fact in 2008, at B and V bands, the sky was ~ 0. 3 mag /arcsec^ 2 darker than in 1999 - 2002. With these results we conclude that Mt.

Here, we describe the photometric calibration of the PTF data products that allows the PTF magnitudes {{to be related to}} other magnitude systems. The calibration process utilizes Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) r ∼ 16 mag point-source objects as photometric standards. During <b>photometric</b> <b>conditions,</b> this allows us to solve for the extinction coefficients and color terms and to estimate the camera illumination correction. This also enables the calibration of fields that are outside the SDSS footprint. We test the precision and repeatability of the PTF photometric calibration. Given that PTF is observing in a single filter each night, we define a PTF calibrated magnitude system for the R band and g band. We show that, in this system, ≈ 59 % (47 %) of the photometrically calibrated PTF R-band (g-band) data achieve a photometric precision of 0. 02 - 0. 04 mag and have color terms and extinction coefficients that are close to their average values. Given the objects' color, the PTF magnitude system can be converted to other systems. Moreover, a night-by-night comparison of the calibrated magnitudes of individual stars observed on multiple nights shows that they are consistent to a level of ≈ 0 : 02 mag. Most of the data that were taken under nonphotometric conditions can be calibrated relative to other epochs of the same sky footprint obtained during <b>photometric</b> <b>conditions.</b> We provide a concise guide describing how to use the PTF photometriccalibration data products, as well as the transformations between the PTF magnitude system and the SDSS and Johnson-Cousins systems. © 2012.
