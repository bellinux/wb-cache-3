5|$|Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809– April 15, 1865) was an American statesman {{and lawyer}} {{who served as}} the 16th President of the United States from March 1861 until his {{assassination}} in April 1865. Lincoln led the United States through its Civil War—its bloodiest war and <b>perhaps</b> <b>its</b> greatest moral, constitutional, and political crisis. In doing so, he preserved the Union, paved the way to the abolition of slavery, strengthened the federal government, and modernized the economy.|$|E
5|$|The 181-room hotel, {{opened in}} 1902, was {{designed}} by architect Goldwin Starrett. It was originally conceived as a residential hotel but was quickly converted to a traditional lodging establishment. Its first owner-manager, Frank Case (who bought the hotel in 1927), established many of the hotel's traditions. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>its</b> best-known tradition is hosting literary and theatrical notables, most prominently {{the members of the}} Algonquin Round Table.|$|E
5|$|The University {{offers a}} variety of {{professional}} and specialized programs, including the only schools of law and medicine in the state of North Dakota. Its best known college is <b>perhaps</b> <b>its</b> John D. Odegard School of Aerospace Sciences, which is the first in the country to offer a degree in unmanned aircraft systems operations, and is competitively ranked as one of the world's top schools of aviation and aerospace.|$|E

5|$|Between 1946 and 1949, {{the average}} {{size of the}} design team working on the Mark 1 and its predecessor, the SSEM, had been about four people. During that time 34patents were taken out based on the team's work, either by the Ministry of Supply or by its successor, the National Research Development Corporation. In July 1949, IBM invited Williams to the United States on an all-expenses-paid trip to discuss the Mark 1's design. The company {{subsequently}} licensed several of the patented ideas developed for the machine, including the Williams tube, {{in the design of}} its own 701 and 702 computers. The most significant design legacy of the Manchester Mark 1 was <b>perhaps</b> <b>its</b> incorporation of index registers, the patent for which was taken out in the names of Williams, Kilburn, Tootill, and Newman.|$|E
5|$|ETNC's {{relative}} success {{during this}} period led to rivalry with other nearby colleges such as T. Henry Bridges' Henry College in Campbell, a 1904 attempt by Denison to entice Mayo to relocate the college there for {{a considerable amount of}} financial aid, and praise from <b>perhaps</b> <b>its</b> most famous alumnus, future Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Sam Rayburn. By the time the 35th Texas Legislature voted to buy the college in 1917, it had educated more than 30,000 students, including more public school teachers than any other college or university in Texas during the same period.|$|E
5|$|The Australian squadrons {{played a}} limited {{role in the}} allied advance from Amiens on 8 August 1918, with No. 3 Squadron engaged in {{reconnaissance}} and contact patrols to help identify the locations of forward troops. They also undertook extensive aerial photography to aid in remapping and the locating of German artillery positions. During this period Nos. 2 and 4 Squadrons were in the Ypres–Arras area and were involved in patrols and raids on the railways {{in the vicinity of}} Lille. With the Germans in retreat during September 1918, the squadrons felt considerable pressure just keeping up. Regardless, No. 4 Squadron took part in, <b>perhaps</b> <b>its</b> most spectacular action, in the very last weeks of the war. On 29 October, 15 Australian Sopwith Snipes encountered more than 60 German Fokkers, in an action which became one of the largest air battles of the war. The Australians gained the upper hand and 10 Fokkers were shot down for the loss of one Snipe, and the damage of several others.|$|E

It contains over 70 specific initiatives {{that range from}} growing diversity to increasing student involvement in service learning projects. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>its</b> most visible development {{is the creation of}} academic and student life buildings, as well as roads, parking, utilities, and landscapes to support those buildings.|$|E
25|$|Captained by Lt. (sr.g.) R.E. Donegan, USCG, LST-21 {{arrived at}} Norwalk Harbor for Navy Day {{celebrations}} 27 October 1945. The ship arrived on Thursday, 25 October, coming from Casco Bay, Maine, {{with a crew}} of 100. The LST made what is <b>perhaps</b> <b>its</b> last beach landing at Calf Pasture Beach in Norwalk, and {{over the course of}} Saturday and Sunday welcomed up to 20,000 visitors.|$|E

25|$|The Mercury's smaller {{size was}} aimed at fighter use and it powered the Gloster Gauntlet and its successor, the Gloster Gladiator. It was {{intended}} that the larger Pegasus would be for bombers but as the power ratings of both engines rose, the Mercury found itself being used in almost all roles. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>its</b> most famous use was in a twin-engine light bomber, the Bristol Blenheim.|$|E
25|$|The {{book was}} not an {{enormous}} success, but has persisted. In 1965 a review by Bryan Magee for Encounter observed that the book had hung on in libraries as an adventure tale for children, but regretted that it was neglected by adults. The review recognised that <b>perhaps</b> <b>its</b> greatest interest was now the insight it gave as to Churchill's beliefs as a young man. The character of Savrola identified precisely with Churchill himself, with what he wished to be and what he later became.|$|E
25|$|After 50 years, {{during which}} {{solid-state}} electronic components have largely displaced the vacuum tube, the photomultiplier remains {{a unique and}} important optoelectronic component. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>its</b> most useful quality is that it acts, electronically, as a nearly perfect current source, owing to the high voltage utilized in extracting the tiny currents associated with weak light signals. There is no Johnson noise associated with photomultiplier signal currents, {{even though they are}} greatly amplified, e.g., by 100 thousand times (i.e., 100dB) or more. The photocurrent still contains shot noise.|$|E

25|$|The KU men's {{basketball}} team has fielded a team {{every year since}} 1898. The Jayhawks are a perennial national contender, coached by Bill Self. The team has won five national titles, including three NCAA tournament championships in 1952, 1988, and 2008. The basketball program is currently the second winningest program in college basketball history with an overall record of 2,070–806 through the 2011–12 season. The team plays at Allen Fieldhouse. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>its</b> best recognized player was Wilt Chamberlain, who played in the 1950s.|$|E
25|$|Luna 10 {{conducted}} {{extensive research}} in lunar orbit, gathering important {{data on the}} strength of the Moon’s magnetic field, its radiation belts, and the nature of lunar rocks (which were found to be comparable to terrestrial basalt rocks), cosmic radiation, and micrometeoroid density. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>its</b> most important finding was the first evidence of mass concentrations (called “mascons”)areas of high density below the mare basins that distort lunar orbital trajectories. Their discovery has usually been credited to the American Lunar Orbiter series.|$|E
25|$|Maiasaura were herbivorous. They {{were capable}} of walking both on two (bipedal) or four (quadrupedal) legs. Studies of the stress {{patterns}} of healed bones show that young juveniles under four years old walked mainly bipedal, switching to a mainly quadrupedal style of walking when they grew larger. They appeared to have no defense against predators, except, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>its</b> heavy muscular tail and their herd behavior. Herds were extremely large and could have comprised as many as 10,000 individuals. Maiasaura lived in an inland habitat.|$|E

25|$|Combining {{elements}} {{of many of}} AP Bank's projects, Yoyogi Village is <b>perhaps</b> <b>its</b> most open to the general public, aiming to break the perception that environmentally friendly products are bland or boring. It was built in order to reinvigorate Yoyogi on the old site of the 19th century Yoyogi village, before {{the rise of the}} neighboring districts Shinjuku and Harajuku led to the areas decline. Yoyogi Village consists of the two zones surrounding a central landscaped garden by Seijyun Nishihata featuring trees from Spain, Chile, Brazil and Mexico.|$|E
25|$|Asplenium ×gravesii, {{commonly}} known as Graves' spleenwort, is a rare, sterile, hybrid fern, named for Edward Willis Graves (1882–1936). It is formed by the crossing of Bradley's spleenwort (A.bradleyi) with lobed spleenwort (A.pinnatifidum). It is only found where its parent species are both present; in practice, this proves {{to be a few}} scattered sites in the Appalachian Mountains, Shawnee Hills, and Ozarks, reaching <b>perhaps</b> <b>its</b> greatest local abundance around Natural Bridge State Resort Park. Like its parents, it prefers to grow in acid soil in the crevices of sandstone cliffs.|$|E
25|$|The Avro 707B {{joined the}} R.A.E. in September 1952 {{and was one}} of the {{aircraft}} used by the Empire Test Pilots School from January to September 1956, when it was damaged on landing, and broken up at R.A.E. Bedford. The two-seat 707C joined the R.A.E. January 1956; <b>perhaps</b> <b>its</b> most substantial research contribution was to the development of fly-by-wire control systems, one of the first of their kind, and fitted with a side stick controller. This aircraft was flying with the R.A.E. until September 1966 when it achieved its full airframe time.|$|E
