500|$|The {{band has}} named the group Melvins as an {{influence}} on its development, but the most-publicized influence is progressive rock <b>pioneer</b> <b>group</b> King Crimson. Longtime King Crimson member Robert Fripp has downplayed any influence his band had on Tool. In an interview, Fripp touched on how the two bands relate to each other, stating [...] "Do you hear the influence? There's just one figure where I hear an influence, just one. It was a piece we were developing that we dropped. And it's {{almost exactly the same}} figure: three note arpeggio with a particular accent from the guitar. So I do not think you could have heard it. That's the only thing." [...] He also said, [...] "I happen to be a Tool fan. The members of Tool have been generous enough to suggest that Crimson has been {{an influence on}} them. Adam Jones asked me if I could detect it in their music, and I said I couldn’t. I can detect more Tool influence in King Crimson, than I can hear King Crimson in Tool." [...] In describing their wide range of styles, critics have noted that they are [...] "influenced as much by Pink Floyd as by the Sex Pistols". Other reported influences of the band include Rush, Helmet, Faith No More and Jane's Addiction.|$|E
2500|$|New shapes {{include the}} psykter and the pelike. Large krater and amphorae became popular at this time. Although {{there is no}} {{indication}} that the painters understood themselves as a group in the way that modern scholarship does, there were some connections and mutual influences, perhaps in an atmosphere of friendly competition and encouragement. Thus, a vase by Euthymides is inscribed [...] "as Euphronios never [...] ". More generally, the <b>pioneer</b> <b>group</b> tended to use inscriptions. The labelling of mythological figures or the addition of Kalos inscriptions are the rule rather than the exception.|$|E

2500|$|The {{artists of}} the {{so-called}} [...] "Pioneer Group" [...] made the step towards a full exploitation of the possibilities of the red-figure technique. They were active between circa 520 and 500 BC. Important representatives include Euphronios, Euthymides and Phintias. This group, recognised and defined by twentieth-century scholarship, experimented with the different possibilities offered by the new style. Thus, figures appeared in new perspectives, such as frontal or rear views, and there were experiments with perspective foreshortening and more dynamic compositions. As a technical innovation Euphronios introduced the [...] "relief line". At the same time new vase shapes were invented, a development favoured {{by the fact that}} many of the <b>pioneer</b> <b>group</b> painters were also active as potters.|$|E

5000|$|Phintias was {{an ancient}} Greek vase painter; along with Euphronios and Euthymides, {{he was one}} of the most {{important}} representatives of the <b>Pioneer</b> <b>Group</b> of Athenian red-figure vase painters. Ten works from the period between 525 BC and 510 BC bearing his signature survive: seven vase paintings and three pottery works. Since his career began before the time of the <b>Pioneer</b> <b>Group,</b> his paintings look somewhat more old-fashioned than those of the other Pioneers; and the influence of earlier red-figure painters such as Psiax or Oltos is strong. Even during the <b>Pioneer</b> <b>Group</b> period he continued to use certain techniques of the black-figure style, e.g. outlines reinforced by scratching and black-figure ornamental borders. His paintings have been called clear, concise, and exact, but also static and somewhat stiff. Phintias' repertoire, however, is rich. He drew everyday scenes such as hetaerae, symposia and music lessons, but also mythological scenes. Like the other major members of the <b>Pioneer</b> <b>group,</b> he frequently wrote on his vases, and depicted some of his [...] "colleagues".|$|E
