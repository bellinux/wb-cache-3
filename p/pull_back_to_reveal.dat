On Metacritic, the film received a rating of 18 out of 100, based on 9 critics, indicating [...] "overwhelming dislike". New York Times film critic Ben Kenigsberg said that Cameron's acting [...] "sounds so forced you half-expect the camera to <b>pull</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> hostage takers". Billings Gazette named it the worst Christmas movie of all time in 2016, and Will Nicol of Digital Trends included it on his list of the ten worst movies ever made.

40|$|Long {{hidden from}} {{academic}} scrutiny, children of prisoners have recently become {{the subjects of}} much academic study, {{through a variety of}} disciplines and methods. However many issues within this topic remain under-examined. This study aimed to explore two such issues: the self-reported experiences of children of prisoners, and children in the Canadian context. This thesis analyses the results of qualitative interviews with children aged 6 - 17 who currently have a parent in prison (N= 22). Employing a ‘sociology of childhood’ framework, this project seeks to centre the voice of children themselves, privileging their own views and meaning-making. These data are supplemented with other findings to provide context to children’s narratives, including: interviews with these children’s caregivers in the community (N= 12); interviews with a variety of key informants; observations gathered during extensive recruitment efforts with families of prisoners; and reviews of existing policy documents and service provision specific to parental incarceration. The thesis begins with a review of the existing literature, followed by a description of the methods used in the present study. The analysis then begins in Chapter 4 with a discussion of the context of these children’s lives, with a particular focus on poverty. Moving to the data from children themselves, Chapters 5 and 6 explore children’s inner lives and immediate relationships, specifically their emotions about parental incarceration and relationships with their parents. Chapters 7 and 8 <b>pull</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> children’s interactions with their communities, and Chapter 9 widens the lens further to explore their experiences within the social policy context. Through a variety of empirical findings and by telling the story of parental incarceration in Canada from a critical and child-centred perspective, this thesis contributes to the scholarly understanding of parental incarceration...|$|E

50|$|The film concludes {{the next}} day, with the {{survivors}} rigging up a radio receiver and listening for {{news of the}} attacks. To their surprise, the radio broadcast doesn't mention the attacks, indicating that the outside world is oblivious to what has happened.

50|$|Rosefeldt’s work {{consists}} {{primarily of}} elaborate, visually opulent {{film and video}} installations. In most cases, these installations are shown as panoramic multi-channel projections. They range in style from documentary to theatrical narrative. In Lonely Planet (2006), for example, the artist portrays a hippie-ish Western backpacker on a trip through India; as he moves {{through a series of}} clichéd sequences, including a frenetic Bollywood-inspired dance number, the camera periodically <b>pulls</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> spotlights, dressing rooms and other filmmaking necessities. Rosefeldt primarily uses 16-mm and 35-mm film and has often worked in close cooperation with the cinematographer Christoph Krauss.|$|R

5000|$|Though {{a film of}} Taras Bulba did not follow, Lewton {{was hired}} by MGM {{to work as a}} {{publicist}} and assistant to Selznick. His first screen credit was [...] "revolutionary sequences arranged by" [...] in David O. Selznick's 1935 version of A Tale of Two Cities. Lewton also worked as an uncredited writer for Selznick's Gone with the Wind, including writing the scene where the camera <b>pulls</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> hundreds of wounded soldiers at the Atlanta depot. Lewton also worked for Selznick as a story editor, a scout for discovering literary properties for Selznick's studio, and a go-between with the Hollywood censorship system.|$|R
5000|$|The movie {{ends with}} a pair of monologues. First, Munson is seen in a {{shopping}} mall narrating the events of {{the rest of his life}} [...] - [...] his wife will leave him in five years; in eight years, he will drunkenly collapse and fall asleep in a snowbank after a wedding reception in Alaska and be discovered and successfully thawed the following spring. Then, Soderbergh returns in front of a blank movie screen and asks if there are any questions. After offering several responses ("Yes." [...] "Yes." [...] "Foot-long veggie on wheat." [...] "Thank you."), he walks offstage as the camera <b>pulls</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> he's been talking to an empty auditorium.|$|R
2500|$|The {{regeneration}} [...] "effect" [...] {{was accomplished}} during the series' original run from 1963–1989 primarily {{through the use}} of video mixing. Originally, the plan was to have Hartnell collapse at the end of The Tenth Planet with his cloak over his face, which would then be <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> Troughton in the next serial. However, vision mixer Shirley Coward discovered and took advantage of a malfunction in the mixing desk which allowed Hartnell's image to be overexposed to the point of almost whiting out the screen, then fading <b>back</b> in <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> Troughton's face. This also meant that the regeneration scene could take place with both actors at the conclusion of The Tenth Planet, and Troughton was accordingly signed up to participate.|$|R
50|$|Geoffrey {{gets the}} money, and then tricks Elizabeth of taking it from him. Elizabeth is then arrested for {{possession}} of the illegal money, but Tim also comes after Geoffrey. When he does, Geoffrey happily gives him the stolen jewels, but only with the condition that Tim agrees to marry Corky, and that the couple adopt Susan as their daughter. The last scene shows Geoffrey writing a new birthday card to Susan, for her sixth birthday this time, telling her how much he loves her, {{and that he is}} happy {{to have been able to}} give her new parents. The camera <b>pulls</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> that Geoffrey and Sam are sitting playing cards on a prison transport train. Beside them sits Geoffreys cousin Elizabeth.|$|R
50|$|The UKTV Documentary {{identity}} focused around {{scenes from}} the landscape of Britain. The ident would first feature a close up shot, for example of a person or a stone, before <b>pulling</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> the bigger picture: such as a busy rail station or a stone circle. This was then overlaid with the UKTV Documentary logo, consisting of the UKTV logo on top, and an upper case 'DOCUMENTARY' tag below, aligned {{to the left of}} the screen. Alongside the idents, the channel had a Digital on-screen graphic (DOG) of the same design and also featured a generic UKTV design for all promotions for the channel. The channels house colour was a blue, similar in shade to Azure, and would feature in numerous changing shades on the end boards of promotions.|$|R
50|$|The {{apparatus}} {{consists of}} a substantial table {{with an array of}} menacing metal spikes suspended above it. The basic premise is that the performer will be restrained on the table and must escape before the spikes are released and allowed to fall. A curtain is drawn around the apparatus to obscure the performer from view while he or she attempts the escape. The sequence of events is arranged so that it initially appears the spikes fall before the performer has had time to get out from under them; however, the curtain is then <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> the performer free and unharmed. Sometimes a scrim is used instead of a curtain and, with back lighting, it is arranged that the audience see the silhouetted shadow of the performer struggling to escape before the spikes fall.|$|R
50|$|Tommy and Julie ride to {{the prom}} in a rented stretch limousine; Randy and Fred arrive shortly after and sneak backstage. Randy becomes {{increasingly}} annoyed with watching the Valley High kids dance, but Fred assures him all is going according to plan. Julie and Tommy are escorted backstage, waiting to be introduced as king and queen of the prom. Randy confronts Tommy, and the two begin to brawl. When the prom king and queen are announced, the curtain <b>pulls</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> Randy beating up Tommy. Randy knocks Tommy out, then escorts a thrilled Julie from the stage through the crowd. Tommy recovers and storms through the crowd towards Randy and Julie, who start a food fight to slow Tommy down and facilitate their escape from the venue in Tommy's rented limousine.|$|R
50|$|Kevin {{passes out}} and awakes {{in his bedroom}} to find it filled with smoke. Firefighters break down the door and rescue him as they put out a fire in his house. One of the firemen finds that his parents' new toaster oven caused the fire. As Kevin recovers, he finds one of the firemen resembles Agamemnon and {{discover}}s that {{he still has the}} photos from his adventure. Kevin's parents discover a smouldering rock in the toaster oven. Recognizing it as a piece of Evil, Kevin warns them not to touch it. Ignoring him, they touch it then explode, leaving two piles of ash. Kevin tentatively approaches the smoking ash and is seen from above as his figure grows smaller, the camera <b>pulling</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> the planet and then outer space, before being rolled up in the map by the Supreme Being.|$|R
5000|$|As {{a cartoon}} {{character}} dressed in prison stripes (and holding a peace-logo flower which {{turns into a}} tiny parasol and then a helicopter blade) executes a few dance steps {{to the music of}} Nilssons Skidoo theme, the words [...] "Otto Preminger" [...] appear below him. Additional words [...] "presents SKIDOO starring" [...] can also be seen as the camera <b>pulls</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> that this image is on a TV screen, while Carol Channings voice is heard exclaiming, [...] "No, Harry, not that. No, I dont wanna see that", with the channel suddenly switching to show a US Senate hearing conducted by (fictional) Senator Hummel, portrayed by Peter Lawford, who asks a series of organized crime figures various questions to which they invariably reply, [...] "I refuse to answer on the grounds it may tend to incriminate me".|$|R
5000|$|Film critic Steve Schneider calls Jones' {{version of}} Daffy [...] "a kind of {{unleashed}} id." [...] Jones {{said that his}} version of the character [...] "expresses all of the things we're afraid to express." [...] This is evident in Jones' Duck Amuck (1953), [...] "one of the few unarguable masterpieces of American animation" [...] according to Schneider. In the episode, Daffy is plagued by a godlike animator whose malicious paintbrush alters the setting, soundtrack, and even Daffy. When Daffy demands to know who is responsible for the changes, the camera <b>pulls</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> none other than Bugs Bunny. Duck Amuck is widely heralded as a classic of filmmaking for its illustration that a character's personality can be recognized independently of appearance, setting, voice, and plot. In 1999, the short was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.|$|R
5000|$|Hitchcock's {{emerging}} {{style is}} well demonstrated in this film. He {{used a variety}} of screen techniques to tell the story with a minimum of title cards, preferring instead to allow the film's visual narrative tell the story. A good example is the scene after Roddy leaves home. It opens with the title card [...] "The world of make-believe". This is followed by a closeup of Roddy in a tuxedo. The camera <b>pulls</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> Roddy is actually playing a waiter on stage in a theatre. Hitchcock also incorporated shots of a descending escalator at Maida Vale tube station as a visual metaphor for Roddy's downhill descent. He experimented with dream sequences by shooting them in super impositions and blurred images. He played with shadow and light {{in much the same way}} as directors of German expressionist films of the time.|$|R

50|$|The video {{begins with}} Lisa Lopes at her {{apartment}} receiving a phone call, presumably from Jones, informing her that the music video for the song is being aired on TV. She turns to the TV screen behind her playing the video, which shows Jones at a hotel party, and proceeds to watch it. As it turns out, Lopes {{is not the only}} person watching the video, as the video pans across the building showing Usher and his girlfriend at his apartment, and Big Boi hosting a music video premiere at his apartment. Midway through the video, Lopes leaves her apartment and recites her verse in the song while walking across the corridor, presumably to join Jones at a similar party {{at the back of the}} building, which is revealed as the camera <b>pulls</b> <b>back</b> from the corridor. At the end, the video <b>pulls</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> Jones watching it at his apartment with his girlfriend.|$|R
2500|$|The {{video for}} the song was filmed near Slough, Berkshire, during November 1981 and has {{the theme of the}} filming and editing of a murder-mystery film, {{featuring}} the band members as characters and production staff. [...] Due to it being a [...] "making of" [...] video, both crew and camera apparatus appear throughout. It was conceived and directed by filmmaker Steve Barron, and has at its core the interaction between a successful actress (also a 2nd negative cutter) played by Susan Ann Sulley walking out on [...] "film director" [...] Philip Oakey on a film set. [...] It is loosely based on the film A Star Is Born. Near the end of the video, Wright, who also plays a film editor, has an expression on his face, while the camera <b>pulls</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> that the negative room where Oakey, Wright, and Sulley were working in is yet another set (the camera {{can be seen in the}} mirror's reflection).|$|R
