40|$|Dynamical {{decoupling}} (DD) is {{an efficient}} tool for preserving quantum coherence in solid-state spin systems. However, the imperfections of real pulses can ruin {{the performance of}} long DD sequences. We investigate the accumulation and compensation of different <b>pulse</b> <b>errors</b> in DD using the electron spins of phosphorus donors in silicon as a test system. We study periodic DD sequences (PDD) based on spin rotations about two perpendicular axes, and their concatenated and symmetrized versions. We show that <b>pulse</b> <b>errors</b> may quickly destroy some spin states, but maintain other states with high fidelity over long times. Pulse sequences based on spin rotations about $x$ and $y$ axes outperform those based on $x$ and $z$ axes due to the accumulation of <b>pulse</b> <b>errors.</b> Concatenation provides {{an efficient way to}} suppress the impact of <b>pulse</b> <b>errors,</b> and can maintain high fidelity for all spin components: <b>pulse</b> <b>errors</b> do not accumulate (to first order) as the concatenation level increases, despite the exponential {{increase in the number of}} pulses. Our theoretical model gives a clear qualitative picture of the error accumulation, and produces results in quantitative agreement with the experiments. Comment: 13 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} method {{for the design of}} low {{complexity}} tim-ing <b>error</b> <b>detectors</b> in orthogonal space-time block coding (OS-TBC) receivers. A general expression for the S-curve of timing <b>error</b> <b>detectors</b> is derived. Based on this result, we obtain suffi-cient conditions for a difference of threshold crossings timing estimate that is robust to channel fading. A number of tim-ing <b>error</b> <b>detectors</b> for 3 - and 4 -transmit antenna codes are pre-sented. The performance is evaluated by examining their track-ing capabilities within a timing loop of an OSTBC receiver. Symbol-error-rate results are presented showing negligible loss due to timing synchronization.

40|$|We {{perform a}} {{detailed}} theoretical-experimental {{study of the}} dynamical decoupling (DD) of the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. We investigate the DD sequences applied to suppress the dephasing of the electron spin of the NV center induced by the coupling to a spin bath composed of the substitutional nitrogen atoms. The decoupling efficiency of various DD schemes is studied, including both periodic and aperiodic pulse sequences. For ideal control pulses, {{we find that the}} DD protocols with the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) timing of the pulses provides best performance. We show that, as the number of control pulses increases, the decoupling fidelity scaling differs qualitatively from the predictions of the Magnus expansion, and explain the origin of this difference. In particular, more advanced symmetrized or concatenated protocols do not improve the DD performance. Next, we investigate the impact of the systematic instrumental <b>pulse</b> <b>errors</b> in different periodic and aperiodic pulse sequences. The DD protocols with the single-axis control do not preserve all spin components {{in the presence of the}} <b>pulse</b> <b>errors,</b> and the two-axis control is needed. We demonstrate that the two-axis control sequence with the CPMG timing is very robust with respect to the <b>pulse</b> <b>errors.</b> The impact of the <b>pulse</b> <b>errors</b> can be diminished further by symmetrizing this protocol. For all protocols studied here, we present a detailed account of the <b>pulse</b> <b>error</b> parameters which make the strongest impact on the DD performance. In conclusion, we give specific recommendations about choosing the decoupling protocol for the system under investigation. QN/Quantum NanoscienceApplied Science...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{computer}} scaling {{trends in}} pursuit of larger component counts and power efficiency have, unfortunately, lead to less reliable hardware and consequently soft errors escaping into application data ("silent data corruptions"). Techniques to enhance system resilience hinge {{on the availability of}} efficient <b>error</b> <b>detectors</b> that have high detection rates, low false positive rates, and lower computational overhead. Unfortunately, efficient detectors to detect faults during address generation (to index large arrays) have not been widely researched. We present a novel lightweight compiler-driven technique called PRESAGE for detecting bit-flips affecting structured address computations. A key insight underlying PRESAGE is that any address computation scheme that flows an already incurred error is better than a scheme that corrupts one particular array access but otherwise (falsely) appears to compute perfectly. Enabling the flow of errors allows one to situate detectors at loop exit points, and helps turn silent corruptions into easily detectable error situations.
