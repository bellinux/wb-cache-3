50|$|One sperm fertilizes the {{egg cell}} {{and the other}} sperm {{combines}} with the two <b>polar</b> <b>nuclei</b> of the large central cell of the megagametophyte. The haploid sperm and haploid egg combine to form a diploid zygote, while the other sperm and the two haploid <b>polar</b> <b>nuclei</b> of the large central cell of the megagametophyte form a triploid nucleus (triple fusion). Some plants may form polyploid nuclei. The large cell of the gametophyte will then develop into the endosperm, a nutrient-rich tissue which provides nourishment to the developing embryo. The ovary, surrounding the ovules, develops into the fruit, which protects the seeds and may function to disperse them.|$|E
50|$|The two central cell {{maternal}} nuclei (<b>polar</b> <b>nuclei)</b> {{that contribute}} to the endosperm, arise by mitosis from the same single meiotic product that gave rise to the egg. The maternal contribution to the genetic constitution of the triploid endosperm is double that of the embryo.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn Bombyx mori, <b>polar</b> body <b>nuclei</b> are {{observed}} until 9 h after egg lying, however, {{the fate of}} <b>polar</b> body <b>nuclei</b> remains unclear. To examine the fate of <b>polar</b> body <b>nuclei,</b> we employed a mutation of serosal cell pigmentation, pink-eyed white egg (pe). The heterozygous pe/+pe females produced black serosal cells in white eggs, while pe/pe females did not produce black serosal cells in white eggs. These {{results suggest that the}} appearance of black serosal cells in white eggs depends on the genotype (pe/ +pe) of the mother. Because the <b>polar</b> body <b>nuclei</b> had +pe genes in the white eggs laid by a pe/ +pe female, <b>polar</b> body <b>nuclei</b> participate in development and differentiate into functional cell (serosal cells). Analyses of serosal cells pigmentation indicated that approximately 30 % of the eggs contained polar-body-nucleus-derived cells. These results demonstrate that polar-body-nucleus-derived cells appeared at a high frequency under natural conditions. Approximately 80 % of polar-body-nucleus-derived cells appeared near the anterior pole and the dorsal side, which is opposite to where embryogenesis occurs. The number of cells derived from the <b>polar</b> body <b>nuclei</b> was very low. Approximately 26 % of these eggs contained only one black serosal cell. PCR-based analysis revealed that the polar-body-nucleus-derived cells disappeared in late embryonic stages (stage 25). Overall, polar-body-nuclei-derived cells were unlikely to contribute to embryos...|$|R
50|$|Males {{are unknown}} in this species and the adults are all females. During reproduction, the eggs remain unfertilised {{and thus have}} half the number of {{chromosomes}} of a normal cell.

50|$|Fertilisation or {{fertilization}} (see spelling differences), {{also known}} as generative fertilisation, conception, fecundation, syngamy and impregnation, is the fusion of gametes to initiate {{the development of a}} new individual organism. The cycle of fertilisation and development of new individuals is called sexual reproduction. During double fertilisation in angiosperms the haploid male gamete combines with two haploid <b>polar</b> <b>nuclei</b> to form a triploid primary endosperm nucleus by the process of vegetative fertilisation.|$|E
50|$|In {{flowering}} plants, the megagametophyte (also {{referred to}} as the embryo sac) is much smaller and typically consists of only seven cells and eight nuclei. This type of megagametophyte develops from the megaspore through three rounds of mitotic divisions. The cell closest to the micropyle opening of the integuments differentiates into the egg cell, with two synergid cells by its side that are involved in the production of signals that guide the pollen tube. Three antipodal cells form on the opposite (chalazal) end of the ovule and later degenerate. The large central cell of the embryo sac contains two <b>polar</b> <b>nuclei.</b>|$|E
50|$|The germinated pollen tube {{must then}} drill {{its way through}} the nutrient-rich style and curl {{to the bottom of the}} ovary to reach the ovule. Once the pollen tube {{successfully}} attains an ovule, it delivers the two sperm cells with a burst. One of them fertilizes the egg cell to form an embryo, which will become the future plant. The other one fuses with both <b>polar</b> <b>nuclei</b> of the central cell to form the endosperm, which serves as the embryo's food supply. Finally, the ovary will develop into a fruit and the ovules will develop into seeds.|$|E

40|$|Oogenesis and {{spermatogenesis}} {{were studied}} in populations of M. graminicola and M. naasi {{from which the}} species were originally described. Maturation of oocytes and spermatocytes in both species was by normal meiosis. The haploid chromosome number determined during {{the first and second}} maturation divisions was n = 18 with no variation. The somatic chromosome number determined in early cleavage divisions and, to a limited extent, in oogonial divisions was 2 n = 36. Reproduction was regularly by meiotic parthenogenesis in both species. Re-establishment of the somatic chromosome number in mature oocytes, apparently took place through fusion of the second <b>polar</b> <b>nucleus</b> with the egg pronucleus. Occasional reproduction by cross-fertilization was demonstrated in M. graminicola and it is suspected in M. naasi in cultures with abundant males.

5000|$|In {{flowering}} plants, one sperm nucleus fuses {{with the}} egg cell {{to produce a}} zygote, the other fuses with the two <b>polar</b> <b>nuclei</b> of the central cell to give rise to the polyploid (typically triploid) endosperm. This double fertilization is unique to flowering plants, although in some other groups the second sperm cell does fuse with another cell in the megagametophyte to produce a second embryo. The plant stores nutrients such as starch, proteins, and oils in the endosperm as a food source for the developing embryo and seedling, serving a similar function to the yolk of animal eggs. The endosperm is also called the albumen of the seed.|$|E
5000|$|Flowering plants {{generate}} gametes using {{a specialized}} cell division called meiosis. Meiosis {{takes place in}} the ovule (a structure within the ovary that is located within the pistil {{at the center of the}} flower) (see diagram labeled [...] "Angiosperm lifecycle"). A diploid cell (megaspore mother cell) in the ovule undergoes meiosis (involving two successive cell divisions) to produce four cells (megaspores or female gametes) with haploid nuclei. [...] One of these four cells (megaspore) then undergoes three successive mitotic divisions to produce an immature embryo sac (megagametocyte) with eight haploid nuclei. Next, these nuclei are segregated into separate cells by cytokinesis to producing 3 antipodal cells, 2 synergid cells and an egg cell. Two <b>polar</b> <b>nuclei</b> are left in the central cell of the embryo sac.|$|E
50|$|Double {{fertilisation}} is {{the process}} in angiosperms (flowering plants) in which two sperm from each pollen tube fertilise two cells in a female gametophyte (sometimes called an embryo sac) that is inside an ovule. After the pollen tube enters the gametophyte, the pollen tube nucleus disintegrates and the two sperm cells are released; {{one of the two}} sperm cells fertilises the egg cell (at the bottom of the gametophyte near the micropyle), forming a diploid (2n) zygote. This is the point when fertilisation actually occurs; pollination and fertilisation are two separate processes. The nucleus of the other sperm cell fuses with two haploid <b>polar</b> <b>nuclei</b> (contained in the central cell) in the centre of the gametophyte. The resulting cell is triploid (3n). This triploid cell divides through mitosis and forms the endosperm, a nutrient-rich tissue, inside the seed.|$|E

40|$|Nuclear {{structural}} changes during fertilization and embryogenesis in mice and in sea urchins have {{been followed by}} using antibodies against the nuclear lamins A/C and B and against antigens at the periphery of nuclei and chromosomes. Lamins are found on all pronuclei and nuclei during mouse fertilization, but with a diminished intensity on the second <b>polar</b> body <b>nucleus.</b> On sperm in both systems, lamins are reduced and detected only at the acrosomal and centriolar fossae. In sea urchin eggs, lamins are found on both pronuclei. Unlike in other dividing cells, the mitotic chromosomes of sea urchin eggs and embryos retain an association with lamins. The peripheral antibodies delineate each chromosome and nucleus except the mature mouse sperm nucleus. A dramatic change from the expected lamin distribution occurs during early development. In mouse morulae or blastocysts, lamins A/C are no longer recognized, although lamin B remains. In sea urchins both lamins A/C and lamin B, as detected with polyclonal antibodies, are lost after the blastula stage, although a different lamin A/C epitope emerges as recognized by a monoclonal antibody. These results demonstrate that pronucleus formation in both systems involves a new association or exposure of lamins, that the <b>polar</b> body <b>nucleus</b> is largely restricted from the cytoplasmic pool of lamins, and that mitotic chromosomes in the rapidly proliferating sea urchin egg retain associated lamins. They also suggest that changes in the expression or exposure of different lamins are a common feature of embryogenesis...|$|R

50|$|In eudicot plants, {{the entire}} process happens inside the ovule of a plant. The details of the process vary by species, but the process {{described}} here is common. This process starts with a single diploid megasporocyte in the nucleus. This megasporocyte undergoes meiotic cell division to form four cells that are haploid. Three cells die {{and one that is}} most distant from the micropyle develops into the megaspore. This megaspore becomes larger and the nucleus of it undergoes mitosis three times until there are eight nuclei. These eight nuclei are then arranged into two groups of four. These groups both send a nucleus {{to the center of the}} cell which then becomes the <b>polar</b> <b>nuclei.</b> The three cells left at the end of the cell near the micropylar become the egg apparatus with an egg cell in the center and two synergids. A cell wall forms around the other set of nuclei and forms the antipodals. The cells in the center develop into the central cell. This entire structure with its eight nuclei is called the embryo sac.|$|E
50|$|The female gametophyte, the megagametophyte, that {{participates in}} double {{fertilization}} in angiosperms {{is sometimes called}} the embryo sac. This develops within an ovule, enclosed by the ovary {{at the base of}} a carpel. Surrounding the megagametophyte are (one or) two integuments, which form an opening called the micropyle. The megagametophyte, which is usually haploid, originates from the (usually diploid) megaspore mother cell, also called the megasporocyte. The next sequence of events varies, depending on the particular species, but in most species, the following events occur. The megasporocyte undergoes a meiotic cell division, producing four haploid megaspores. Only one of the four resulting megaspores survives. This megaspore undergoes three rounds of mitotic division, resulting in seven cells with eight haploid nuclei (the central cell has two nuclei, called the <b>polar</b> <b>nuclei).</b> The lower end of the embryo sac consists of the haploid egg cell positioned in the middle of two other haploid cells, called synergids. The synergids function in the attraction and guidance of the pollen tube to the megagametophyte through the micropyle. At the upper end of the megagametophyte are three antipodal cells.|$|E
50|$|These {{plants are}} hermaphroditic, with {{anemophilous}} or hydrophilous pollination. The flowers are ebracteate, small, and regular. Commonly, {{the flowers are}} aggregated in ‘inflorescences’, but sometimes they are solitary. Often, they grow in racemes, spikes, or umbels. The scapiflorous inflorescences are terminal, in short spikes, or subumbelliform racemes, sometimes one- or few-flowered. They do not have hypogynous disks. These flowers do not have perianth absent, except when small staminal appendages are regarded as perianth segments. The androecial members are all equal. The androecium just presents two fertile stamens with sessile anthers dehiscing by longitudinal slits. The pollen is polysiphonous and its grains are three-celled and nonaperturate.The gynoecium (2-)4(-16) is superior, carpelled, and euapocarpous. The carpel is not stylate, apically stigmatic with the stigma peltate, or umbonate. These flowers only present one ovule pendulous, nonarillate, campylotropous, bitegmic, and crassinucellate. The placentation is apical and embryo-sac development is of the polygonum type. Before fertilization, they fuse <b>polar</b> <b>nuclei.</b> The fruit is drupaceous and fleshy, forming an aggregate. The fruiting carpel is indehiscent, commonly on a long, spirally twisted peduncle, with each drupelet becoming very long-stalked. The fruit contains one nonendospermic seed with starch. The embryo can be straight or slightly curved. Membranous testa do not have phytomelan.|$|E
40|$|RNAs are {{localized}} by microtubule-based {{pathways to}} both the anterior and posterior poles of the developing Drosophila oocyte. We describe a new gene, wispy, required for localization of mRNAs to both poles of the egg. Embryos from wispy mothers arrest development after abnormal oocyte meiosis and failure of pronuclei to fuse. Our analysis of spindle and chromosome movements during meiosis reveals defects in spindle structures correlated with very high frequencies of chromosome nondisjunction and loss. Spindle defects include abnormally shaped spindles, spindle spurs, and ectopic spindles associated with lost chromosomes, as well as mispositioning of the meiosis II spindles. The <b>polar</b> body <b>nuclei</b> do not associate with their normal monastral arrays of microtubules, the sperm aster is reduced in size, and the centrosomes often dissociate from a mitotic spindle that forms {{in association with the}} male pronucleus. We show that wispy is required to recruit or maintain known centrosomal proteins with two types of microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs) : (1) the central MTOC that forms between the meiosis II tandem spindles and (2) the centrosomes of the mitotic spindle. We propose that the wispy gene product functions directly in several microtubule-based events in meiosis and early embryogenesis and speculate about its possible mode of action...|$|R

40|$|The {{promoters}} of MEA (FIS 1), FIS 2, and FIE (FIS 3), genes that repress seed {{development in the}} absence of pollination, were fused to β-glucuronidase (GUS) to study their activity pattern. The FIS 2 ∷GUS product is found in the embryo sac, in each of the <b>polar</b> cell <b>nuclei,</b> and in the central cell nucleus. After pollination, the maternally derived FIS 2 ∷GUS protein occurs in the nuclei of the cenocytic endosperm. Before cellularization of the endosperm, activity is terminated in the micropylar and central nuclei of the endosperm and subsequently in the nuclei of the chalazal cyst. MEA∷GUS has a pattern of activity similar to that of FIS 2 ∷GUS, but FIE∷GUS protein is found in many tissues, including the prepollination embryo sac, and in embryo and endosperm postpollination. The similarity in mutant phenotypes; the activity of FIE, MEA, and FIS 2 in the same cells in the embryo sac; and the fact that MEA and FIE proteins interact in a yeast two-hybrid system suggest that these proteins operate in the same system of control of seed development. Maternal and not paternal FIS 2 ∷GUS, MEA∷GUS, and FIE∷GUS show activity in early endosperm, so these genes may be imprinted. When fis 2, mea, and fie mutants are pollinated, seed development is arrested at the heart embryo stage. The seed arrest of mea and fis 2 is avoided when they are fertilized by a low methylation parent. The wild-type alleles of MEA or FIS 2 are not required. The parent-of-origin-determined differential activity of MEA, FIS 2, and FIE is not dependent on DNA methylation, but methylation does control some gene(s) that have key roles in seed development...|$|R
50|$|After megasporogenesis, the {{megaspore}} develops {{into the}} female gametophyte (the embryo sac) {{in a process}} called megagametogenesis. The process of megagametogenesis varies depending on which pattern of megasporogenesis occurred. Some species, such as Tridax trilobata, Ehretia laevis, and Alectra thomsoni, can undergo different patterns of megasporogenesis and therefore different patterns of megagametogenesis. If the monosporic pattern occurred, the single nucleus undergoes mitosis three times, producing an eight-nucleate cell. These eight nuclei are arranged into two groups of four. These groups both send a nucleus {{to the center of}} the cell; these become the <b>polar</b> <b>nuclei.</b> Depending on the species, these nuclei fuse together before or upon fertilization of the central cell. The three nuclei at the end of the cell near the micropylar become the egg apparatus, with an egg cell in the center and two synergids. At the other end of the cell, a cell wall forms around the nuclei and forms the antipodals. Therefore, the resulting embryo sac is a seven-celled structure consisting of one central cell, one egg cell, two synergid cells, and three antipodal cells. The bisporic and tetrasporic patterns undergo varying processes and result in varying embryo sacs as well. In Lilium which has a tetrasporic pattern, the central cell of the embryo sac is 4N. Therefore, upon fertilization the endosperm will be 5N rather than the typical 3N.|$|E
40|$|An ultrastructural {{study on}} the {{development}} of the central cell was carried out on rice (Oryza sativa L.). The results showed that following the formation of the eight nuclei in the embryo sac, cellularization took place resulting in the formation of seven cells. One of the cells situated in the centre of the embryo sac was the central cell. The central cell contained a large vacuole, two <b>polar</b> <b>nuclei</b> (located in micropylar part and chalzal end, respectively) and a large number of cytoplasmic organella. Further development of the central cell mainly involved changes in the orientation of the <b>polar</b> <b>nuclei</b> and the distribution of the cytoplasm. Changes in the orientation of the <b>polar</b> <b>nuclei</b> involved the following stages of developments a. The two <b>polar</b> <b>nuclei</b> increased in size and became elliptical in shape. On both sides of the <b>polar</b> <b>nuclei</b> the cytoplasm showed an asymmetrical pattern of distribution. b. The two <b>polar</b> <b>nuclei</b> moved to the central region of embryo sac. At this stage the two <b>polar</b> <b>nuclei</b> were close to each other and they were lying ('one on top of the other') in parallel to the long axis of the embryo sac. When the <b>polar</b> <b>nuclei</b> moved to the central region of the embryo sac, a thick strand of cytoplasm (forming a cytoplasmic 'bridge') became associated with the <b>polar</b> <b>nuclei.</b> The cytoplasm 'bridge' ran from one end of the embryo sac to the other. c. The two <b>polar</b> <b>nuclei</b> began to move towards the egg cell and finally 'sat' themselves on the top of the egg cell. The two <b>polar</b> <b>nuclei</b> had by now changed from a parallel (one on top of the other) to perpendicular (side by side) orientation (with respect to the long axis of the embryo sac). The side of the nuclear envelope of the two <b>polar</b> <b>nuclei</b> facing each other produced a lot of protrusions and fusion bridges throughout the different stages of development and reorientation of the <b>polar</b> <b>nuclei.</b> The cytoplasm surrounding the <b>polar</b> <b>nuclei</b> also went through some changes e. g. starch grains disappeared and smooth ER increased. UP till stage c the size of the embryo sac did not change much. But immediately after the completion of stage c the embryo sac greatly increased in size. The embryo sac then reached full maturity and apparently did not undergo any further changes. 本文通過透射電鏡對水稻受精前胚囊中央細胞發育過程中超微結構的變化進行觀察。結果表明，八核胚囊形成后很快就進行細胞化形成 7 個細胞，其中剛形成的中央細胞由 1 個大液泡、 2 個極核（珠孔端和合點端各 1 個）和一些含有豐富細胞器的胞質組成。中央細胞以后的發育主要是極核的發育和極核周圍胞質的變化。極核發育經歷以下過程：a． 2 個核都膨大呈“橢圓”形。核周圍胞質呈不對稱分布。b． 2 個核分別向胚囊中央移動并相互靠近。之后 2 個極核調整排列方式，由縱排（即與胚囊縱軸平行）變成橫排。此時期有細胞質“橋”聯結珠孔端卵器、 2 個極核和合點端反足細胞器。c．橫排的極核移向卵器，并排列于卵細胞之上。此時胚囊未明顯膨大，但極核相靠近的兩邊核膜有許多處已形成“融合橋”，核周圍的胞質也起較大的變化，如質體內淀粉消失和光面內質網增加等。極核進一步發育直至胚囊成熟期間，極核排列方式及其周圍胞質組成未觀察到明顯的變化，但胚囊體積明顯增大...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe atomic {{electrostatic}} potentials {{calculated by}} the CHELPG method {{have been shown}} to be sensitive indicators of the gas phase and solution properties of the statins. Solvation free energies in water, n-octanol and n-octane have been determined using the SMD solvent model. The percentage hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity (or lipophilicity) of the statins in solution have been determined using (a) the differences in solvation free energies between n-octanol and n-octane as a measure of hydrophilicity, and the solvation energy in octane as a measure of hydrophobicity (b) the sum of the atomic electrostatic charges on the hydrogen bonding and <b>polar</b> bonding <b>nuclei</b> of the common pharmacophore combined with a solvent measure of hydrophobicity, and (c) using the buried surface areas after statin binding to HMGCR to calculate the hydrophobicity of the bound statins. The data suggests that clinical definitions of statins as either "hydrophilic" or "lipophilic" based on experimental partition coefficients are misleading. An estimate of the binding energy between rosuvastatin and HMGCR has been made using: (a) a coulombic electrostatic interaction model, (b) the calculated desolvation and resolvation of the statin in water, and (c) the first shell transfer solvation energy as a proxy for the restructuring of the water molecules immediately adjacent to the active binding site of HMGCR prior to binding. De-solvation and re-solvation of the statins before and after binding to HMGCR are major determinants of the energetics of the binding process. An analysis of the amphiphilic nature of lovastatin anion, acid and lactone and fluvastatin anion and their abilities to cross the blood brain barrier has indicated that this process may be dominated by desolvation and resolvation effects, rather than the statin molecular size or statin-lipid interactions within the bilayer. The ionization energy and electron affinity of the statins are sensitive physical indicators of the ease that the various statins can undergo endogenous oxidative metabolism. The absolute chemical hardness is also an indicator of the stability of the statins, and may be a useful indicator for drug design...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Cell nuclei are {{important}} indicators of cellular processes and diseases. Segmentation {{is an essential}} stage in systems for quantitative analysis of nuclei extracted from microscopy images. Given {{the wide variety of}} nuclei appearance in different organs and staining procedures, a plethora of methods have been described in the literature to improve the segmentation accuracy and robustness. Materials and Methods: In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method for cell nuclei detection and segmentation in two-dimensional microscopy images. The nuclei in the image are detected automatically using a matching-based method. Next, edge maps are generated at multiple image blurring levels followed by edge selection performed in <b>polar</b> space. The <b>nuclei</b> contours are refined iteratively in the constructed edge pyramid. The validation study was conducted over two cell nuclei datasets with manual labeling, including 25 hematoxylin and eosin-stained liver histopathology images and 35 Papanicolaou-stained thyroid images. Results: The nuclei detection accuracy was measured by miss rate, and the segmentation accuracy was evaluated by two types of error metrics. Overall, the nuclei detection efficiency of the proposed method is similar to the supervised template matching method. In comparison to four existing state-of-the-art segmentation methods, the proposed method performed the best with average segmentation error 10. 34 % and 0. 33 measured by area error rate and normalized sum of distances (× 10). Conclusion: Quantitative analysis showed that the method is automatic and accurate when segmenting cell nuclei from microscopy images with noisy background and {{has the potential to be}} used in clinic settings...|$|R

Soybean partial-sterile mutants 1, 2, 3, and 4 (PS- 1, PS- 2, PS- 3, and PS- 4) are characterized by reduced number of seed per pods. The objectives were to study the inheritance, linkage, allelism, and reproductive biology of the PS 2 ̆ 7 s mutants. For inheritance and linkage tests the PS 2 ̆ 7 s mutants were crossed to Harosoy-w[subscript] 4, and to chlorophyll-deficient mutants CD- 1 and CD- 5, also {{recovered from}} the tagging study. For allelism tests reciprocal crosses were made between PS 2 ̆ 7 s mutants. The gene in PS- 1 is a single recessive gene, which was inherited in a 3 : 1 ratio. The genes in PS- 2, PS- 3, and PS- 4 were inherited in a 1 : 1 ratio. Reciprocal crosses made between normal plants from PS- 2, PS- 3, PS- 4 with 2 ̆ 7 BSR 1012 ̆ 7 indicated that the PS 2 ̆ 7 s were homozygous for normal chromosome structure. Linkage results from F[subscript] 2 and F[subscript] 3 generations indicated that the gene for partial sterility in the PS 2 ̆ 7 s was not linked to the w[subscript] 4 locus or to the CD- 1 or CD- 5 mutants. Allelism test showed that the gene in PS- 1 was nonallelic to the gene in PS- 2, PS- 3, and PS- 4. The allelism test also indicated that the gene for partial sterility in PS- 2, PS- 3, and PS- 4 was not transmitted to the next generation when PS- 2, PS- 3 and PS- 4 mutants were used as female parent. Results of pollen grains stained with iodine potassium iodide, differential staining, and fluorescein diacetate, from partial-sterile plants of PS 2 ̆ 7 s mutants, indicated no difference in stainability, morphology, and fluorescence compared to pollen grains from normal plants. These results suggested that the pollen grains from PS 2 ̆ 7 s mutants were fully viable. Megagametogenesis indicated that the ovule abortion in PS- 1 mutant was due to abnormalities associated with <b>polar</b> nuclei/secondary endosperm <b>nucleus.</b> The failure of double fertilization, the absence of endosperm development and lack of nutrients in the PS- 1 ovule mutant lead to early embryo abortion. PS- 2, PS- 3, and PS- 4 had normal megagametogenesis which was identical to ovule development in normal plants. At anthesis, the embryo sac had the egg apparatus, with two synergids and egg cell, and the secondary endosperm nucleus. Thus the lack of fertilization in these mutants was probably due a specific gene already imprinted in the gametes and it was not due to failure of pollen-tube growth...|$|R
30|$|The {{distance}} between the <b>polar</b> <b>nuclei</b> decreased until they were beside each other, and their membranes entered in contact getting fused, and sometimes a single nucleus with two nucleoli inside could be observed (Fig.  4 b). Finally, {{as a result of}} the <b>polar</b> <b>nuclei</b> karyogamy the nucleus of the central cell was generated (Fig.  4 a). The nucleus of the central cell was of a semicircular or ovoid shape with an average size of 15.85  ±  1.11  μm long by 16.41  ±  1.21  μm wide.|$|E
30|$|According to Tilton (1978), in angiosperms, antipodals are {{cells that}} {{vary in their}} {{behavior}} in the mature megagametophyte and the only trait they share with each other is their location in the chalazal end of the sac; the antipodals can be ephemeral, degraded shortly after their formation or persist even after fertilization (Williams and Friedman 2004). In Tofieldia glutinosa, antipodals can even proliferate in the maturation stage of the embryo sac, being up to eight antipodal nuclei (Holloway and Friedman 2008). <b>Polar</b> <b>nuclei</b> in Agave tequilana were observed close to the antipodals remains and being similar in shape and size as reported by Maheshwari (1950) and Tilton and Lersten (1981). The position of the <b>polar</b> <b>nuclei</b> {{is similar to that}} observed in Hemiphylacus alatostylus (Rudall et al. 1997) which are located in the chalazal end within a tube or neck (chalazal haustorium), and in Tofieldia glutinosa where <b>polar</b> <b>nuclei</b> are located at a two-thirds distance from the micropylar end of the embryo sac (Holloway and Friedman 2008).|$|E
40|$|During {{the life}} cycle of the {{flowering}} plant, there are normally three occasions when nuclei fuse: (1) when the two <b>polar</b> <b>nuclei</b> of the mature megagametophyte fuse; (2) when one of the two male nuclei fuses with the egg nucleus; (3) when the second male nucleus fuses with the combined <b>polar</b> <b>nuclei.</b> Observations on the actual fusion of the nuclei made with the light microscope are vague and conflicting (Maheshwari, 1950; Sharp, 1943; Vazart, 1958). Recent observations made with the electron microscope and reported here have revealed the basic method of nuclear fusion in the cases mentioned above...|$|E
30|$|It was {{observed}} that in Agave tequilana, karyogamy of the <b>polar</b> <b>nuclei</b> {{to form the}} diploid nucleus of the central cell occurred before the process of double fertilization, similar to that observed in ovules of Capsella bursa-pastoris (Schulz 1973) and Tofieldia glutinosa (Holloway and Friedman 2008). This diploid nucleus remained {{at the same place}} where both <b>polar</b> <b>nuclei</b> were observed at the chalazal extreme of the embryo sac. This chalazal position of the central cell nucleus has been observed in Yucca rupicola (Watkins 1937), Persea americana (Tomer and Gottreich 1976) and Tofieldia glutinosa (Holloway and Friedman 2008) among others. However, Piven et al. (2001) reported for Agave fourcroydes and A. angustifolia that the position of the <b>polar</b> <b>nuclei</b> and finally the nucleus of the central cell were located {{in the center of the}} embryo sac; or close to the egg apparatus at the micropylar end, a pattern that is present in almost all angiosperms (Tilton 1978; Russell 1993), particularly in Zea mays (Huang and Sheridan 1994) and in Arabidopsis thaliana (Olsen 2004).|$|E
40|$|The central cell is the binucleate cell of the {{angiosperm}} megagametophyte {{which contains}} the <b>polar</b> <b>nuclei</b> and participates in double fertilization. The {{structure of the}} mature central cell, the fusion of the <b>polar</b> <b>nuclei</b> and the primary endosperm nucleus were studied with the electron microscope. The central cell cytoplasm appears very active and has an extensive ER, many mitochondria, dictyosomes, microbodies, polysomes, chloroplasts with well developed grana and starch and lipid reserves. A single, giant mitochondrion appears in the cytoplasm near the <b>polar</b> <b>nuclei</b> {{at the time of}} fertilization, but its origin, fate and function are not known. Cyto-plasmic aggregates of dense, granular material are associated with the primary endosperm nucleus and structurally resemble the nucleolus and similar aggregates in the nucleoplasm. ft is suggested that these cytoplasmic perinuclear bodies may represent extruded nucleolar material. The central cell cytoplasm does not undergo any notable structural reorganization as a result of fertilization. The relationship of the central cell to the other cells of the mature megagametophyte and its possible role in embryogenesis is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The female {{gametophyte}} plays {{a central}} role in the sexual reproduction of angiosperms. We previously isolated the maa 3 (magatama 3) mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana, defective in development of the female gametophyte, micropylar pollen tube guidance, and preventing the attraction of multiple pollen tubes. We here observed that the nucleolus of <b>polar</b> <b>nuclei</b> is small, and that the fusion of <b>polar</b> <b>nuclei</b> often did not occur at the time of pollination. The MAA 3 gene encodes a homolog of yeast Sen 1 helicase, required for RNA metabolism. It is suggested that MAA 3 may regulate RNA molecules responsible for nucleolar organization and pollen tube guidanc...|$|E
