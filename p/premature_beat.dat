50|$|A {{premature}} ventricular contraction (PVC)—also {{known as}} a premature ventricular complex, ventricular premature contraction (or complex or complexes) (VPC), ventricular <b>premature</b> <b>beat</b> (VPB), or ventricular extrasystole (VES)—is a relatively common event where the heartbeat is initiated by Purkinje fibers in the ventricles {{rather than by the}} sinoatrial node, the normal heartbeat initiator. The electrical events of the heart detected by the electrocardiogram (ECG) allow a PVC to be easily distinguished from a normal heart beat. Although a PVC can be a sign of decreased oxygenation to the heart muscle, often PVCs are benign and may even be found in otherwise healthy hearts.|$|E
50|$|On an {{electrocardiogram}} (ECG), PACs {{are characterized}} by an abnormally shaped P wave. Since the <b>premature</b> <b>beat</b> initiates outside the sinoatrial node, the associated P wave appears different from those seen in normal sinus rhythm. Typically, the atrial impulse propagates normally through the atrioventricular node and into the cardiac ventricles, resulting in a normal, narrow QRS complex. However, if the atrial beat is premature enough, it may reach the atrioventricular node during its refractory period, in which case {{it will not be}} conducted to the ventricle {{and there will be no}} QRS complex following the P wave.|$|E

50|$|Any part of {{the heart}} that initiates an impulse without waiting for the sinoatrial node is called an ectopic focus and is, by definition, a {{pathological}} phenomenon. This may cause a single <b>premature</b> <b>beat</b> now and then, or, if the ectopic focus fires more often than the sinoatrial node, it can produce a sustained abnormal rhythm. Rhythms produced by an ectopic focus in the atria, or by the atrioventricular node, are the least dangerous dysrhythmias; but they can still produce {{a decrease in the}} heart's pumping efficiency, because the signal reaches the various parts of the heart muscle with different timing than usual and can be responsible for poorly coordinated contraction.|$|E
50|$|The Gallavardin {{phenomenon}} is a clinical sign found {{in patients with}} aortic stenosis. It is described as the dissociation between the noisy and musical components of the systolic murmur heard in aortic stenosis. The harsh noisy component is best heard at the upper right sternal border radiating to the neck due to the high velocity jet in the ascending aorta. The musical high frequency component is best heard at the cardiac apex. The presence of a murmur at the apex can be misinterpreted as mitral regurgitation. However, the apical murmur of the Gallavardin phenomenon does not radiate to the left axilla and is accentuated by a slowing of the heart rate (such as a compensatory pause after a <b>premature</b> <b>beat)</b> whereas the mitral regurgitation murmur does not change.|$|E

A linear relationship could be demonstrated between the prematurity of the extra beat and the amplitude of the postcompensatory contraction. The increase of amplitude of the postcompensatory contraction was found to counterbalance the decrease of the <b>premature</b> <b>beat.</b> At a constant net rate, whether the rhythm was regular or not, the average contraction height was constant.

Thirty-two {{patients}} (10 male, 22 female; age 37 - 82 years) undergoing maintenance haemodialysis or haemofiltration {{were studied}} {{by means of}} Holter device capable of simultaneously analysing rhythm and ST-changes in three leads. Twenty-five patients were on haemodialysis, seven on haemofiltration, mean duration of haemodialysis/haemofiltration being 3. 4 + 3 years. Incidence of ventricular tachycardia was low, being detected only in 1 of 32 patients.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} role of {{caffeine}} restriction {{in the management of}} patients with symptomatic idiopathic ventricular premature beats. DESIGN: A randomised, double blind, 6 week intervention trial incorporating dietary caffeine restriction, caffeinated coffee, and decaffeinated coffee. SETTING: Cardiac outpatient clinic. PATIENTS: 13 patients with symptomatic frequent idiopathic ventricular premature beats. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Weekly measures of serum caffeine concentration, coffee consumption, visual analogue score of palpitations, and 24 hour ventricular <b>premature</b> <b>beat</b> frequency. RESULTS: The interventions achieved significant alterations in serum caffeine concentrations (P < 0. 001) which correlated with coffee consumption (r = 0. 70; P < 0. 001). Visual analogue palpitation scores showed a small, but significant correlation with ventricular <b>premature</b> <b>beat</b> frequencies (r = 0. 34; P = 0. 003).

40|$|Primary {{ventricular}} fibrillation {{was seen in}} 20 of 450 consecutive patients (4 - 4 %) admitted within 24 hours after the onset of acute myocardial infarction. Compared with patients without primary {{ventricular fibrillation}} they showed a lower mean age group and {{a higher incidence of}} anterior infarction. Warning ventricular arrhythmias preceded primary ventricular fibrillation in 58 % of cases. However, warning arrhythmias were also present in 55 % of patients without primary ventricular fibrillation. The following mechanisms of initiation of primary ventricular fibrillation were seen. 1) In one patient, it was initiated by supraventricular premature beats showing aberrant intraventricular conduction. 2) In 2 patients, ventricular tachycardia degenerated into primary ventricular fibrillation. 3) In 17 patients, it was initiated by a ventricular premature beat; in 10 of these, the <b>premature</b> <b>beat</b> showed early coupling (RR/QT less than 1 [...] the R-on-T phenomenon).

The study suggests that warning arrhythmias and the R-on-T phenomenon are poor predictors of primary ventricular fibrillation in acute myocardial infarction.

40|$|Abstract- The atrial {{activity}} {{of the human heart}} is normally visible in the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal as a P-wave. In patients with intermittent artery heart disease, a different P-wave morphology can sometimes be seen, indicating atrial conduction defects. The {{purpose of this study was}} to use a supervised neural network (NN) -based algorithm to discriminate between an atrial premature beats (APB) and normal ones. The performance of the method was measured using eight recordings of each type from MIT-BIH database, based on the morphology of the P-wave and the duration of the QS segment between the Q-wave of the APB beat and the previous S-wave. The method achieved a sensitivity of 92 % and a specificity of 89 % in discrimination of APB beats from normal ones.

Mid ventricular short-axis tomographic images obtained during regular sinus rhythm and subsequent premature ventricular beats provided comparative measurements of global and segmental systolic changes of cross-sectional luminal areas and myocardial wall thickness. Computer-assisted standardized analysis of segmental systolic fractional area change and wall thickening was used to map left ventricular contraction during normal rhythm and premature beats of 70 % coupling interval, induced alternately from anterior and lateral aspects of the mid-left ventricular short-axis cross-sectional plane. A characteristic pattern consisting of early systolic contraction and wall thickening was followed by paradoxical motion and wall thinning in late systole in segments corresponding to the region of direct electrical stimulation.
