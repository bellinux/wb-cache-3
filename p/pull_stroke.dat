5000|$|The Japanese saw or nokogiri (...) {{is a type}} of saw used in {{woodworking}} and Japanese carpentry {{that cuts}} on the <b>pull</b> <b>stroke,</b> unlike most European saws that cut on the push stroke. Japanese saws are the best known pull saws, but they are also used in Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Nepal. Among European saws, both coping saws for woodworking and jewelers saws for metal working also cut on the <b>pull</b> <b>stroke</b> like Japanese saws. Cutting on the <b>pull</b> <b>stroke</b> is claimed to cut more efficiently and leave a narrower cut width (...) [...] On the other hand, a <b>pull</b> <b>stroke</b> does not easily permit putting ones body weight behind a stroke. This can be readily solved by using a vise or clamping. Another disadvantage, due to the arrangement and form of the teeth , is that Japanese saws do not work as well on hardwoods as European saws do. Japanese saws were originally intended for comparatively soft woods like cypress and pine whereas European saws were intended for hard woods like oak and maple.|$|E
50|$|Some saws, such as Japanese saws {{and those}} used by the ancient Egyptians, are {{designed}} to cut only on the <b>pull</b> <b>stroke.</b> Western saws, on the other hand, are designed to cut on the push stroke.|$|E
50|$|On {{the vast}} {{majority}} of saws throughout the world, the teeth are designed to cut when the saw is being pushed through the wood (on the push stroke or down stroke). However, some saws (such as Japanese saws and the saws used by Ancient Egyptians) are designed to cut on the <b>pull</b> <b>stroke.</b>|$|E

50|$|On hacksaws, as {{with most}} frame saws, the blade can be mounted with the teeth facing toward or away from the handle, {{resulting}} in cutting action on either the push or <b>pull</b> <b>stroke.</b> In normal use, cutting vertically downwards with work held in a bench vice, hacksaw blades should be set to be facing forwards. Some frame saws, including Fret Saws and Piercing Saws, have their blades set to be facing the handle because {{they are used to}} cut by being pulled down against a horizontal surface.|$|E
5000|$|Dōzuki [...] - [...] a Japanese backsaw, {{used for}} centuries by {{carpenters}} and cabinetmakers in Japan. Although this saw {{does not share}} an ancestry with the other backsaws in this group, the concept is the same. Like most Japanese saws, the dōzuki cuts on the <b>pull</b> <b>stroke,</b> allowing for much straighter and narrower cuts than those achieved with push-stroke saws. This is due to tension on the blade during the cut (versus compression for a western saw), so less thickness is required to keep the saw blade straight.|$|E
50|$|Vises of {{any sort}} are used far less in {{traditional}} Japanese carpentry than {{would be the case}} for equivalent tasks in the traditional crafts of the West. Many tasks in Japanese carpentry associated with building, involve very large pieces of timber, and in general the weight of the timber and of the carpenter are used to stabilize the piece on which the carpenter is working. For this reason the carpenter's horses used in Japan are much lower than their Western counterparts, and carpenters must always position themselves over their work.Much of the work on smaller pieces of material can be done in the seated position, and relies {{on the fact that the}} saws and planes both cut on the <b>pull</b> <b>stroke,</b> enabling stabilization of the work using the body or shooting board.|$|E

50|$|The {{coping saw}} blade is {{installed}} with the teeth pointing towards the handle. Unlike a hacksaw, {{which has the}} teeth pointed away from the handle, the coping saw cuts on the <b>pull</b> <b>stroke.</b> The coping saw blade is removable by partially unscrewing the handle. The blade is prevented from rotating {{by means of the}} short, steady bar provided where the blade is attached. Loosening the handle also allows the blade to be rotated relative to the frame as desired. Carefully aligning the finger with the steady bars at {{the top and bottom of}} the blade ensures that the thin blade is straight and not twisted along its length. Retightening the handle tensions the blade and locks it at the desired angle relative to the frame. The short steady bar nearest the handle is held securely between finger and thumb while the handle is tightened to ensure the blade remains at the desired angle. Unlike the fretsaw the coping saw blade has holding pins which lock securely into the angled slots of the rotatable blade holders.|$|E
50|$|Saws were {{at first}} {{serrated}} {{materials such as}} flint, obsidian, sea shells and shark teeth.In ancient Egypt, open (unframed) saws made of copper are documented {{as early as the}} Early Dynastic Period, circa 3,100-2,686 BC. Many copper saws were found in tomb No. 3471 dating to the reign of Djer in the 31st century BC. Saws have been used for cutting a variety of materials, including people (see Death by sawing). Models of saws have been found in many contexts throughout Egyptian history. Particularly useful are tomb wall illustrations of carpenters at work that show sizes and the use of different types. Egyptian saws were at first serrated, hardened copper which cut on both pull and push strokes. As the saw developed, teeth were raked to cut only on the <b>pull</b> <b>stroke</b> and set with the teeth projecting only on one side, rather than in the modern fashion with an alternating set. Saws were also made of bronze and later iron. In the Iron Age, frame saws were developed holding the thin blades in tension. The earliest known sawmill is the Roman Hierapolis sawmill from the third century AD and was for sawing stone.|$|E
5000|$|Japanese saw (nokogiri 鋸), which cuts on the <b>pull</b> <b>stroke,</b> {{rather than}} the European style push stroke. This allows the blades to be quite thin in {{comparison}} to the Western saw. There are two main kinds of cutting teeth on Japanese saws: rip (yoko noko-giri)and crosscut (tate-noko-giri). The rip and crosscut are combined in one blade, known as a ryoba (lit. [...] "dual edge":; 両刃). The rip and crosscut patterns are also made in single-edged saws, kataha nokogiri 片刃, both with stiffening back pieces and without. The stiff-backed saws, known as douzuki　(lit. [...] "with guide"; 導付き) are typically used in cutting fine joinery. There are many other types of Japanese saws as well: osae-biki 押さえ引き鋸 (lit. [...] "press-cut saw"), used for flush-cutting pegs to a surface without marring the surface. The saw teeth have no set to one or both sides to accomplish this feat. There is the azebiki (lit. ridge saw; 畔挽き), which has cutting both rip and crosscut teeth, and is short and rounded in profile. It is used for sawing in confined areas and starting cuts in the middle of surfaces. There are many other types and sub-types of saw. Most saws sold in the West are mass-produced items with induction-hardened teeth and relatively cheap replaceable blades. The handmade forged saws are very laborious to make and involve more manufacturing steps in the forging to complete than planes or chisels.|$|E

40|$|Witness marks {{produced}} on bone {{by the use}} of saws have traditionally been examined using stereomicroscopy. The marks are typically found on the kerf wall or floor and give important information about the implement that made them. This paper describes a new approach to the analysis of witness marks left on kerf walls and floors from crimes involving dismemberment. Previously, two types of marks have been identified: deep furrows formed during the <b>pull</b> <b>stroke</b> and fine striations formed on the push stroke. These types of striation allow the class of saw to be identified, but not an individual saw. With the advent of environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM), insulating materials can now be examined without the need for conductive coatings to be applied. This allows materials to be examined at higher magnifications than those available with stereomicroscopy. Here we report on a new, third type of striation that is visible at higher magnifications on ESEM images. These striations are formed from the imperfections on the cutting teeth of saws and give real possibilities of uniquely identifying whether or not a particular saw was used to cause the mark. In blind trials conducted on sawing of nylon 6. 6, different individual saws could be successfully identified even if different people used the saw. We discuss ways in which these results can be extended to bone and how this may assist in the investigation of the act of dismemberment. 1059...|$|E

5000|$|The act of <b>pulling</b> <b>strokes</b> has a {{particular}} association with Irish politicians. For instance the former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern has {{a long list of}} questionable financial deeds to his name, yet maintains a popular public perception amongst many. His ability to survive in political life whilst maintaining high approval ratings, and stepping down as Taoiseach on his own terms quantifies a stroke. County Galway politician Michael Fahy is known publicly as [...] "Stroke Fahy", or simply [...] "the Stroke". After being convicted for illegal <b>stroke</b> <b>pulling</b> his popularity actually increased and he topped the polls in the Loughrea electoral area in the 2009 local elections. Many have even argued that Stroke Fahy was somehow wronged, even though he was convicted of misappropriating County Council funds and attempted theft, for which he served 7 months in jail and was fined €75,000.
