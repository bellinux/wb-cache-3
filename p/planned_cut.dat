40|$|Canadian {{education}} {{has traditionally been}} financed by two major sources: (1) transfer payments {{from the federal government}} to the provinces; and (2) residential and business property tax revenues levied by municipalities. The Canadian federal government has recently announced a <b>planned</b> <b>cut</b> of 750 million dollars a year for 3 years in transfer payments for education to the provinces. As a result, school board administrators must make stringent use of budgeting resources that have also recently been reduced at the provincial level. This paper examines the impact of incremental resource reductions on the Wentworth County Board of Education (Ontario), with a focus on maintaining teacher support and service quality in schools while retaining equity of educational provision. It is recommrInded that Ontario carefully restructure {{the way in which the}} resource interface is managed at provincial, school board, and school levels. Measures taken at the school board level will not deliver efficiency, effectiveness, economy, and equity. The continuation of existing administrative structures will result in an unraveling of educational provision, disparities in both the level and quality of services for students, and an inability to address a growing range of professional issues related to equity. The appendix contains the Wentworth County Board of Education budget for fal...|$|E

40|$|No {{research}} has analysed {{the influence of}} ankle muscle activity for joint mobility and stability on preferred directional cutting. Twelve basketballers completed the Y-Shaped agility test, requiring 45 ° cuts {{to the left or}} right, to assess planned and reactive cutting. In planned conditions, participants knew the cutting direction. In reactive conditions, participants responded to a randomly illuminated gate. Legs were defined as the outside (furthest from target gate) or inside (closest to target gate) cut legs. The preferred outside cutting leg was determined from the fastest <b>planned</b> <b>cut.</b> Electromyography measured peak normalised (against 10 - meter sprint performance) activity of the tibialis anterior, peroneus longus (PL), peroneus brevis (PB), and soleus. Paired t-Tests (p > 0. 05) compared preferred and non-preferred cutting legs; effect sizes (d) were calculated. There were no differences in muscle activity between the preferred and non-preferred legs in the planned (p = 0. 218 - 0. 828) or reactive (p = 0. 092 - 0. 862) cuts. There were moderate effects for a 28 % higher PL (d = 0. 51), and 27 % lower PB (d = 0. 57) activity, for the reactive outside cut leg. Due to the synergistic nature of these muscles, there was likely no effect to agility. Irrespective of preferred cutting direction, ankle muscles respond similarly...|$|E
40|$|The 2012 {{election}} gave Japan’s LDP {{control of}} both houses of the Diet, with Shinzo Abe as the new leader promising to provide decisive and energetic leadership out of the malaise {{of the past two}} decades. The vision incorporated in his economic policy program, Abenomics, is to end the two decades of economic stagnation and resignation, revitalize Japanese enterprise, and halt population decline; these go hand‐in‐hand with his political/security desires to restore Japanese self‐confidence and national pride, and make Japan an internationally‐ respected country. The three arrows of Abenomics [...] fiscal policy (the government’s purview), monetary policy (Bank of Japan), and structural reform (private sector and government) [...] have had some initial success, but implementation will take years. Monetary policy has successfully halted deflation, but achieving and then sustaining an annual 2 percent increase in consumer prices will be a major challenge. Fiscal policy’s major challenge persists: achieving sufficient private consumption and investment demand growth so that fiscal consolidation can be implemented. Structural reform to achieve growth requires a wide range of policies, so it is a thousand darts, not a single arrow. Abe’s immediate challenge is how rapidly and how well the economy rebounds from the consumption tax increase, as he faces major policy decisions by year‐end or early next year. Perhaps the most important are whether to pursue the 2 percentage point consumption tax increase scheduled for October 2015, the <b>planned</b> <b>cut</b> in the corporate income tax rate, and whether an agreement can be reached in the Trans‐Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade agreement negotiations...|$|E
