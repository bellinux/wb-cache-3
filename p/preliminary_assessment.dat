5|$|During {{the early}} {{afternoon}} of 3 April, Moore considered conducting a further raid on Kaafjord the next day. He decided against doing so as the <b>preliminary</b> <b>assessment</b> of photos taken during the attack had concluded that Tirpitz was badly damaged. Moore was also aware that his aircrew were fatigued, and was reluctant to expose them to what would now be alert defences. Accordingly, he ordered that the fleet return to base, and it arrived at Scapa Flow in the afternoon of 6 April. King George VI and Prime Minister Winston Churchill sent congratulatory messages to the fleet, but both Churchill and Cunningham were concerned that Tirpitz could be returned to service. Cunningham also regretted Moore's decision not to launch a further strike on 4 April.|$|E

40|$|The Red List Categories and the {{accompanying}} five criteria developed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) provide an authoritative and comprehensive methodology to assess the conservation status of organisms. Red List criterion B, which principally uses distribution data, is {{the most widely used}} to assess conservation status, particularly of plant species. No software package has previously been available to perform large-scale multispecies calculations of the three main criterion B parameters [extent of occurrence (EOO), area of occupancy (AOO) and an estimate of the number of locations] and provide <b>preliminary</b> conservation <b>assessments</b> using an automated batch process. We developed ConR, a dedicated R package, as a rapid and efficient tool to conduct large numbers of <b>preliminary</b> <b>assessments,</b> thereby facilitating complete Red List assessment. ConR (1) calculates key geographic range parameters (AOO and EOO) and estimates the number of locations sensu IUCN needed for an assessment under criterion B; (2) uses this information in a batch process to generate <b>preliminary</b> <b>assessments</b> of multiple species; (3) summarize the parameters and <b>preliminary</b> <b>assessments</b> in a spreadsheet; and (4) provides a visualization of the results by generating maps suitable for the submission of full assessments to the IUCN Red List. ConR can be used for any living organism for which reliable georeferenced distribution data are available. As distributional data for taxa become increasingly available via large open access datasets, ConR provides a novel, timely tool to guide and accelerate the work of the conservation and taxonomic communities by enabling practitioners to conduct <b>preliminary</b> <b>assessments</b> simultaneously for hundreds or even thousands of species in an efficient and time-saving way...|$|R

25|$|The sponges of the Houtman Abrolhos {{are poorly}} studied, {{although}} 109 species of demosponge {{have been collected}} there.
