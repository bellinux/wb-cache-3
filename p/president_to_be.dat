5|$|McCain {{was born}} in the Panama Canal Zone. Had he been elected, he would have become the first {{president}} who was born outside the contiguous forty-eight states. This raised a potential legal issue, since the United States Constitution requires the <b>president</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a natural-born citizen of the United States. A bipartisan legal review, and a unanimous but non-binding Senate resolution, both concluded that he is a natural-born citizen. Also, if inaugurated in 2009 at age 72years and 144days, he would have been the oldest U.S. president upon ascension to the presidency, and the second-oldest <b>president</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> inaugurated.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, {{prosecutors}} {{opened an}} investigation into charges of corruption dating to Pérez Balladares' time in office. He was placed under house arrest the following year, making him the first former Panamanian <b>president</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> arrested, and in October 2010 was charged with money laundering. A judge dismissed the charge against him in April 2011. In February 2012, Pérez Balladares was convicted of slandering comptroller Alvin Weeden by calling him a narcocriminal, and sentenced to a $3,000 fine or a year in prison.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln was {{the first}} American <b>president</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> assassinated and his death had a {{long-lasting}} emotional impact upon the United States. Over the three weeks after his death, millions of Americans participated in a nationwide public pageant of grief, including a state funeral, and the 1,700-mile (2,700km) westward journey of the funeral train from Washington, through New York, to Springfield, Illinois.|$|E

50|$|With such {{conflicting}} perspectives, it can {{be argued}} that a certain polarization between both supporters and opponents of <b>President</b> Uribe seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> forming both inside and outside the country. Uribe was reelected in 2006 after a change in the constitution allowed <b>presidents</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reelected.|$|R
5|$|At {{the time}} McKinley was nominated, {{it was not}} clear who his Democratic rival would be. Cleveland's opponents within his party had mobilized into an {{organized}} effort to take over the Democratic Party and pass a platform supporting free silver. The platform was deemed of highest priority, and only once that fight was won was a candidate for <b>president</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> considered. Despite this resolution, several Democrats sought the nomination, with the foremost being former Missouri representative Richard P. Bland and former Iowa governor Horace Boies. Others either seeking or spoken of for the nomination included South Carolina Senator Benjamin Tillman, Senator Joseph C. Blackburn of Kentucky, and former Nebraska representative William Jennings Bryan.|$|E
5|$|George Walker Bush (born July 6, 1946) is an American {{politician}} {{who served as}} the 43rd President of the United States from 2001 to 2009. He was also the 46th Governor of Texas from 1995 to 2000. After graduating from Yale University in 1968 and Harvard Business School in 1975, he worked in the oil industry. Bush married Laura Welch in 1977 and ran unsuccessfully for the House of Representatives shortly thereafter. He later co-owned the Texas Rangers baseball team before defeating Ann Richards in the 1994 Texas gubernatorial election. Bush was elected president in 2000 after a close and controversial win over Democratic rival Al Gore, becoming the fourth <b>president</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> elected while receiving fewer popular votes than his opponent.|$|E
5|$|Grant won the {{election}} by 300,000 votes out of 5,716,082 votes cast, receiving an electoral college landslide, of 214 votes to Seymour's 80. Grant, {{at the age of}} 46 became the youngest president on record. His election was a triumph of principles that included sound money, efficient government, and the restoration of Southern reconstructed states. Grant was the first <b>president</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> elected after the nation had outlawed slavery and granted citizenship to former slaves. Implementation of these new rights was slow to come; in the 1868 election, the black vote counted in only 16 of the 37 states, nearly all in the South. Grant lost Louisiana and Georgia primarily due to Ku Klux Klan violence against African American voters.|$|E

5|$|John Calvin Coolidge Jr. {{was born}} in Plymouth Notch, Windsor County, Vermont, on July 4, 1872, the only U.S. <b>president</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> born on Independence Day. He was the elder of the two {{children}} of John Calvin Coolidge Sr. (1845–1926) and Victoria Josephine Moor (1846–85). Coolidge Senior engaged in many occupations, and developed a statewide reputation as a prosperous farmer, storekeeper and public servant. He held various local offices, including {{justice of the peace}} and tax collector and served in the Vermont House of Representatives as well as the Vermont Senate. Coolidge's mother was the daughter of a Plymouth Notch farmer. She was chronically ill and died, perhaps from tuberculosis, when Coolidge was twelve years old. His younger sister, Abigail Grace Coolidge (1875–1890), {{died at the age of}} fifteen, probably of appendicitis, when Coolidge was eighteen. Coolidge's father married a Plymouth schoolteacher in 1891, and lived to the age of eighty.|$|E
5|$|The presidential {{election}} of 1977 was necessitated {{by the death}} in office of the incumbent Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed. Although Prime Minister Morarji Desai wanted to nominate danseuse Rukmini Devi Arundale for the post, she turned down the offer. Reddy was elected unopposed, the only <b>President</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> elected thus, after being unanimously supported by all political parties including the opposition Congress party. At 64, he became the youngest ever person to be elected President of India. He was also the only serious presidential candidate to have contested twice – in 1969 against V V Giri and in 1977. 37 candidates had filed their nominations for the presidency of whom 36 were rejected by the returning officer. Following these disqualifications, Reddy remained the only validly nominated candidate in the fray which made elections unnecessary. Reddy thus became {{the first person to}} be elected President of India without a contest and remains the only President to have been elected unopposed.|$|E
5|$|While the Commission is the {{executive}} branch, the candidates are chosen individually by the 28 national governments, which means {{it is not possible}} for a Commission Member or its <b>President</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> removed by a direct election. Rather, the legitimacy of the Commission is mainly drawn from the vote of approval that is required from the European Parliament, along with Parliament's power to dismiss the body, which, in turn, raises the concern of the relatively low turnout (less than 50%) in elections for the European Parliament since 1999. While that figure may be higher than that of some national elections, including the off-year elections of the United States Congress, {{the fact that there are}} no elections for the position of Commission President calls the position's legitimacy into question in the eyes of some. The fact that the Commission can directly decide (albeit with oversight from specially formed 'comitology committees') on the shape and character of implementing legislation further raises concerns about democratic legitimacy.|$|E
50|$|The Congress {{drew up a}} new constitution, {{which was}} promulgated in 1993 after being {{approved}} in a referendum. The new constitution allowed for <b>presidents</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> re-elected, as well as making the Congress a unicameral legislature.|$|R

5|$|William Henry Harrison {{holds the}} record for {{shortest}} term served, holding the office of presidency for 31 days before dying. Harrison was the first president to die while in office when he caught pneumonia and died on April 4, 1841. On July 9, 1850, Zachary Taylor died from acute gastroenteritis. Abraham Lincoln was the first <b>president</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> assassinated. He was shot by John Wilkes Booth on April 14, 1865. Sixteen years later, on September 19, 1881, President James A. Garfield was assassinated by Charles J. Guiteau. Nearly twenty years after that, President William McKinley died from complications after being shot twice by Leon Czolgosz. President Warren G. Harding suffered a heart attack, and died on August 2, 1923. On April 12, 1945, Franklin D. Roosevelt collapsed and {{died as a result}} of a cerebral hemorrhage. The most recent president to die in office was John F. Kennedy, who was assassinated with two rifle shots on November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas.|$|E
5|$|Before {{a person}} can be {{detained}} under the ISA by the Minister for Home Affairs, the President must be satisfied that such detention {{is necessary for the}} purposes of national security or public order. In the landmark case of Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), the Court of Appeal sought to impose legal limits on the power of preventive detention by requiring the Government to adduce objective facts which justified the President's satisfaction. Two months after the decision, a series of legislative and constitutional amendments was enacted that effectively reversed the Chng Suan Tze decision. These amendments were subsequently confirmed to be valid by the High Court and Court of Appeal in Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs (1989–1990), which held it is sufficient for the <b>President</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> subjectively satisfied that a detainee is a threat to national security in order for a detention order to be issued under the ISA. Notable ISA cases include Operation Coldstore in 1963 which led to the arrest of some 100 left-wing politicians and trade unionists, including members of the socialist opposition party, the Barisan Sosialis. Chia Thye Poh, an alleged Communist, was detained and subject to other restrictions on his liberty under the ISA from 1966 to 1998. The Chng Suan Tze and Teo Soh Lung cases resulted from a 1987 security operation called Operation Spectrum in which 22 Roman Catholic church and social activists and professionals accused of being members of a Marxist conspiracy were detained under the ISA.|$|E
