6000|$|This, my lord, is the {{character}} of a courtier without wit; and therefore that which is a satire to other men, must be a panegyric to your lordship, who are a master of it. If the least of these reflections could have reached your person, no necessity of mine could have made me to have sought so earnestly, and so long, to have cultivated your kindness. As a poet, I cannot but have made some observations on mankind; the lowness of my fortune has not yet brought me to flatter vice; and it is my duty to give testimony to virtue. It is true, your lordship is not of that nature, which either seeks a commendation, or wants it. Your mind has always been above the wretched affectation of popularity. A popular man is, in truth, no better than a prostitute to common fame, and to the people. He lies down to every one he meets for the hire of praise; and his humility is only a disguised ambition. Even Cicero himself, whose eloquence deserved the admiration of mankind, yet, by his insatiable thirst of fame, he has lessened his character with succeeding ages; his action against Catiline may be said to have ruined the consul, when it saved the city; for it so swelled his soul, which was not truly great, that ever afterwards it was apt to be over-set with vanity. And this made his virtue so suspected by his friends, that Brutus, whom of all men he adored, refused him a place in his conspiracy. A modern wit has made this observation on him; that, coveting to recommend himself to posterity, he begged it as an alms of all his friends, the historians, to remember his consulship: And observe, if you please, the oddness of the event; all their histories are lost, and the vanity of his request stands yet recorded in his own writings. How much more great and manly in your lordship, is your contempt of popular applause, and your retired virtue, which shines only to a few; with whom you live so easily and freely, that you make it evident, you have a soul which is capable of all the tenderness of friendship, and that you only retire yourself from those, who are not capable of returning it. Your kindness, where you have once placed it, is inviolable; and it is to that only I attribute my happiness in your love. This makes me more easily forsake an argument, on which I could otherwise delight to dwell; I mean, your judgment in your choice of friends; because I have the honour to be one. After which I am sure you will more easily permit me to be silent, in the care you have taken of my fortune; which you have rescued, not only from the power of others, but from my worst of enemies, my own modesty and laziness; which favour, had it been employed on a more deserving subject, had been an effect of justice in your nature; but, as <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>me,</b> is only charity. Yet, withal, it is conferred on such a man, as prefers your kindness itself, before any of its consequences; and who values, as the greatest of your favours, those of your love, and of your conversation. From this constancy to your friends, I might reasonably assume, that your resentments would be as strong and lasting, if they were not restrained by a nobler principle of good nature and generosity; for certainly, it is the same composition of mind, the same resolution and courage, which makes the greatest friendships, and the greatest enmities. And he, who is too lightly reconciled, after high provocations, may recommend himself to the world for a Christian, but I should hardly trust him for a friend. The Italians have a proverb to that purpose, [...] "To forgive the first time, shows me a good Catholic; the second time, a fool." [...] To this firmness in all your actions, though you are wanting in no other ornaments of mind and body, yet to this I principally ascribe the interest your merits have acquired you in the royal family. A prince, who is constant to himself, and steady in all his undertakings; one with whom that character of Horace will agree, ...|$|E

One that leads to finding a new beginning, a new life. Family. The other a life of destruction, towards the end of one brother’s life. Circumstances leads Nate onto Meredith’s porch.

30|$|Quantitative {{enumeration}} of fecal streptococci or enterococci at selected sites {{was performed}} using the standard multiple tube fermentation technique (APHA 1998). In brief, tubes containing 20  mL Azide Dextrose Broth (ADB) were prepared. A series of tubes of ADB was inoculated with appropriate graduated quantities of sample (10, 1 and 0.1  mL). The inoculated tubes were incubated at 37  ±  0.5  °C and examined for turbidity after 24 – 48  h and calculated MPN index/ 100  mL surface water {{depending upon the}} number of positive tubes. Enterococci were recovered from each sample using standard membrane filtration method (APHA 1998). Briefly, tenfold dilutions of each water sample was prepared (100, 10 − 1, 10 − 2 and 10 − 3), and 10  mL of each dilution were filtered through 0.45 -µm, 47 -mm mixed cellulose ester filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) The filters were then <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>mE</b> agar plates incubated at 41  ±  0.5  °C for 48  h for detection and enumeration of enterococci (Hi-Media, India). After 48  h, membrane filters from mE agar plates were placed on Bile Esculin Azide (BEA) agar plates and incubated at 41  ±  0.5  °C for 20  min. Colonies characteristic of enterococci, ranging from pink to dark red on mE agar and producing a brown to black precipitate on BEA agar, were considered presumptive enterococci (APHA 1998). Negative control filters and agar plates were included in each membrane filtration analysis. All colonies were counted, and concentration of enterococci per 100  mL water was determined from dilution plates containing 30 – 300  CFU. Presumptive enterococci recovered (n =  60) from each sample were identified by biochemical tests, including catalase test and PYR test. The growth of isolates was determined in 6.5  % NaCl, pH 9.6, and at 10 °s and 45  °C, respectively. All confirmed enterococci isolates were archived in tryptic soy broth with 15  % (v/v) glycerol at - 80  °C for further analyses.|$|E
