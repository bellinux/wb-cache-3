5|$|Surcharges {{imposed by}} the Irish post office on mail bearing {{insufficient}} pre-paid postage had the <b>postage</b> <b>due</b> collected {{by the use of}} these labels. Since 1925 there have been six series printed, with the design remaining the same until 1980, though the colour and watermarks have changed. The Irish word pingin, for penny, is used in both £.s.d and decimal currency, but because it has the same meaning in each, the value on the label does not indicate whether the label was issued before or after decimalisation. Hence, identifying the issue of a label requires further information: if collectors knows the date of use, the existence of a watermark and if so which type, and the specific colour, identification will be easier. For example, the 3d value was blue between 1940 and 1969, and stone colour from 1971 until 1980; it changed from a watermarked to a non-watermark paper in 1978. Additionally, the 1, 5 and 8 pence values are seen in two different colours depending on the issue, while the d, 1d, 2d and 6d are seen with both watermark varieties. Except for the sixth issue, which has the word Éire in the design, there is no explicit country identity on any of the others. The first four series use only Irish words.|$|E
25|$|With the {{termination}} of Parcel Post stamps the need for Parcel Post <b>Postage</b> <b>Due</b> stamps also ended. They had seen little use since most parcels were properly weighed and paid for at post offices. But in a way analogous to the Parcel Post issues they were retained by postmasters and used as regular <b>postage</b> <b>due</b> stamps until the supplies were exhausted. Some were employed well into the 1920s. The 25-cent denomination was of particular use {{since there was no}} correspondingly valued regular <b>postage</b> <b>due</b> stamp.|$|E

50|$|By 1925 Nejd had {{conquered the}} Kingdom of Hejaz. A variety of stamps were issued during the occupation, {{including}} postage stamps, railway stamps, <b>postage</b> <b>dues</b> and revenue stamps. Many were overprinted, including Turkish stamps made valid for postage in the territory.|$|R
25|$|<b>Postage</b> <b>due</b> stamps {{are special}} stamps applied by {{a post office}} to mail bearing {{insufficient}} postage. The stamps were issued in several denominations to make up different amounts due.|$|E
25|$|Locally printed <b>postage</b> <b>due</b> stamps {{were issued}} on 16 April 1925 {{replacing}} handstruck markings {{that had been}} in use for over a century. A new design of professionally printed stamps was issued on 21 July of that year showing a Maltese cross and British and Maltese coats of arms.|$|E
25|$|In 1885, the Malta Post Office {{was set up}} and British stamps were {{no longer}} valid in Malta. A set of six {{definitive}} stamps along with several types of postal stationery were issued. Malta continued to issue stamps and stationery throughout the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries. At some points from the 1880s to the 1980s, postage stamps were also valid for fiscal use, but at times separate revenue stamps were issued. <b>Postage</b> <b>due</b> stamps were issued between 1925 and the 1990s.|$|E

50|$|As {{a result}} of the {{currency}} reform, in 1905, new stamps were issued. Values from 5b to 50b had a silhouette of King Christian IX, while 1fr, 2fr, and 5fr depicted the sailing ship Ingolf in St. Thomas harbor. New <b>postage</b> <b>dues</b> were required as well. Additional 5b stamps were produced by surcharging older stamps.|$|R
5000|$|The stamps were typographed in two colors, {{except for}} the <b>postage</b> <b>dues,</b> which were printed only in black. There is a {{background}} composed of calligraphic letters, in mirror image, reading Postai devleti Osmaniye, or [...] "Post of the Ottoman Empire", and the Turkish year date 1291, equivalent to 1875. The color combinations used are often striking.|$|R
25|$|Manuscript covers are {{addressed}} envelopes that were designated as Paid {{or where the}} amount of <b>postage</b> <b>due</b> was hand-written with pen and ink. Manuscript markings {{can also be found}} along with various hand-stamp markings, or in combination with postage stamps, which were sometimes applied prior to or after the manuscript marking(s). If the manuscript cover was mail carried by a blockade runner, the cover is usually referred to then as a blockade cover, and so forth with patriotic and other covers.|$|E

50|$|The Empire {{issue was}} first issued in September 1876, {{following}} Turkey's {{entry into the}} Universal Postal Union, and unlike the preceding Duloz issue, bore {{the name of the}} country and the values in Western characters as well as Arabic. They were intended for use to countries in the UPU, but in March 1888 became officially valid for domestic use. The Empire stamps were issued from 1876 to 1890, and the basic postage stamps, not counting overprinted stamps, are assigned a total of 32 catalog numbers by Scott, including three <b>postage</b> <b>dues.</b>|$|R
5|$|These {{were the}} major stamp {{productions}} for everyday use. Commemorative stamps {{first appeared in}} 1929, and these now appear several times a year, celebrating many aspects of Irish life, such as notable events and anniversaries, Irish life and culture, and many famous Irish people. Some definitive and commemorative stamps have been produced in miniature sheet, booklet and coil configurations {{in addition to the}} common sheet layout. <b>Postage</b> <b>dues</b> and airmails complete the stamp issues of the two, sequential, Irish stamp-issuing authorities. Two styles of watermark were used though the overprinted issues came with the watermarks of the British stamps provided for overprinting by the British Post Office.|$|R
50|$|After Doar Ivri, Wallish {{continued}} to be a leading designer of Israeli stamps. His doar ivri design was also used for Israel's first provisional postage dues; he then designed the First Festival stamps (the first bearing the name of Israel, featuring an ancient LMLK seal impression), Israel's first <b>postage</b> <b>dues</b> (1949) and the symbol of the Israel Post. Wallish also designed the annual holiday stamp in 1952, stamps for three philatelic exhibitions (the souvenir sheet for Tabul 1949, Taba 1952, Tabim 1954). He also prepared the first airmail stamps, a definitive series with motifs from ancient art (1950), the coinage stamps definitives (based on doar ivri but with Israel named), as well as provisional official mail (bul sherut) stamps on the coinage design (1951) stamps.|$|R

He has generally agreed with this assessment, and a dust jacket from one of Ellison's books described him as [...] "possibly the most contentious person on Earth". Ellison has filed numerous grievances and attempted lawsuits; as part of a dispute about fulfillment of a contract, he once sent 213 bricks to a publisher <b>postage</b> <b>due,</b> followed by a dead gopher via fourth-class mail. In an October 21, 2017 piece in Wired (magazine), Ellison was dubbed, [...] "Sci-Fi's Most Controversial Figure." ...|$|E
2500|$|A second design, {{with its}} {{inscription}} {{contained in a}} scroll pattern {{in place of the}} circle, was issued in 1902. [...] Known as the London issue, it was printed by Perkins, Bacon & Co., with engraving by the Johnstonia Engraving Company. [...] These stamps had perforations of 13½. [...] In place of the earlier issues' 60, 70, 80 and 90 lepta values, the London issue introduced new denominations of 3, 25, 30 and 50 lepta; it also dropped the 2 drachmae value. [...] With only minor changes, this design has been used on all Greek <b>postage</b> <b>due</b> stamps since.|$|E
5|$|A third {{issue was}} made up of seven labels and issued in decimal {{currency}} in the following values: 1p, 1p, 3p, 4p, 5p, 7p and 8p. In the fourth issue the 3p, 4p and 5p values were reissued in non-watermarked paper on 20 March 1978. A new design, printed by photogravure, and appeared on 20 June 1980 in ten values: 1p, 2p, 4p, 6p, 8p, 18p, 20p, 24p, 30p and 50p made up the fifth issue. The sheet format was two panes of 100 divided by a gutter margin. The sixth issue consisted of ten newly designed labels by Q Design and lithographically printed by ISSP on non-watermarked paper on 6 October 1988. The values were: 1p, 2p, 3p, 4p, 5p, 17p, 20p, 24p, 30p, 50p and £1. No Euro currency <b>postage</b> <b>dues</b> have been produced.|$|R
50|$|In 1950, Wallish {{designed}} a stamp to celebrate Israel's acceptance into the Universal Postal Union. With a globe in the background, the design foregrounds {{the symbol of}} the Israel Post, a running stag. Ironically, he had submitted a bid for a design of the Israel Post symbol but had lost out to the brothers Shamir, who also were active in designing stamps. In 1952, Wallish again featured the running stag in his new series of <b>postage</b> <b>dues.</b> In 1957, the UPU graphic was enlisted for the first Israeli aerogrammes. Wallish lost out to the brothers Shamir again in competing for the 1949 Jerusalem stamp. Whereas the winning design depicts a scene looking up toward the city and the Tower of David, the Wallish artwork shows a flat approach and two religious Jews on the path to Jerusalem.|$|R

2500|$|From May 16, 1948, stamps {{were issued}} by the State of Israel under the Israel Postal Authority. The first set of stamps were {{entitled}} Doar Ivri (lit. [...] "Hebrew postage"), as pictured, while later stamps are issued for Israel. Israeli stamps are trilingual, in Arabic, English and Hebrew, following {{the practice of the}} British Mandate of Palestine. Israel Post first issued <b>postage</b> <b>due</b> stamps, tete-beche and gutter pairs in 1948, airmail stamps in 1950, official mail stamps in 1951 and provisional stamps in 1960. The Israel Defense Forces operate a military postal system but, in 1948, dropped plans to print their own stamps.|$|E
2500|$|The first <b>postage</b> <b>due</b> stamps of Greece {{were issued}} in 1875. [...] The first batch was printed in Vienna, as were further {{releases}} in 1876 and 1890-1893. [...] Green to yellow-green in color, with numerals declaring each stamp's value {{along with the}} inscription ειοπρακτέον(-α) (postage due(s)) inside a central circle, these stamps are known as [...] "rologakia" [...] (little clocks). [...] The first two sets consisted of twelve values; 1 lepton, 2, 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 70, 80 and 90 lepta, 1 drachma and 2 drachmae. [...] The third contained only the 1 lepton, 2, 5, 40 and 60 lepta.

2500|$|During the occupation, Greek airmail {{was limited}} to two {{domestic}} routes; Athens-Thessaloniki and Athens-Heraklion. [...] Foreign destinations were likewise restricted to Germany, Italy and certain Axis-occupied countries. [...] At first, Greek <b>postage</b> <b>due</b> stamps were converted for airmail use by being overprinted with a small airplane design in red. [...] However, these sold out rather quickly, creating {{the need for a}} new issue. [...] A set of six values (2, 5, 10, 20, 25 and 50 drachmae) with designs by O. Perivolarakis depicting various Anemoi, or wind gods, was released on August 15, 1942. [...] This set was re-printed in 1943, with three existing values (10, 25 and 50 drachmae) in different colors from the originals and three new values (100, 200 and 400 drachmae). [...] Inflation rendered these stamps useless for mailing by April 1944; they were withdrawn from circulation in July. [...] In the meantime, the use of regular stamps to cover airmail rates was allowed.|$|E
50|$|The British South Africa Company issued revenue stamps {{for use in}} all of Rhodesia from 1890 to 1909. The {{first issue}} had four values from £1 to £10 and they bore the company's coat of arm. These were {{technically}} valid for <b>postage</b> but <b>due</b> to their high values they never actually saw postal use so they are regarded by many as purely revenue stamps. In 1896, some of these were surcharged with values between £50 and £200. These are incredibly rare as few were printed. Later in 1896, a new square design still featuring the coat of arms but with a more ornate frame was issued. This was replaced in 1898 with a design similar to the original 1890 issue but with some differences in the stamp's border. This set included a £100 cherry red value, with is very rare and only six copies of the stamp are known to exist. Around 1907, some if these stamps were overprinted REVENUE {{to prevent them from}} any postal use, and in 1909 the £1 to £5 values were overprinted RHODESIA when this became the official name. These continued to be used until the 1920s.|$|R
50|$|For each driving post {{consignment}} the postage {{was calculated}} concerning the weight, the postage of value was only charged, if the consignment was declared by {{the means of}} value. For each rating-route the minimum of weight-postage {{was considered to be}} the letter postage. All consignments, for which a higher <b>postage</b> was calculated <b>due</b> to the application of the weight-tariff, it should be charged: for each pound per every 5 miles ½ Kreuzer or 2 Silberpfennig or the respective value in the country's currency. But for heavy letters the respective postage has to be charged according to the letter or driving post tariff. It is optional mailing the consignments unstamped or completely stamping them for the place of destination. The postage acquisition is especially calculated regarding the abovementioned tariff regulations for the delivery route of each individual administration. Returning and forwarding consignments are subject of the taxes for the delivery route for the way forth and back.|$|R

2500|$|Greece's borders were greatly {{expanded}} by the Balkan Wars of 1912–1913 as it occupied Macedonia including {{the city of}} Thessaloniki, parts of Epirus and Thrace and various Aegean islands, as well as formally annexing Crete. [...] Until these so-called [...] "New Territories" [...] were formally incorporated into Greece, they were not permitted to use regular Greek stamps.

[...] A special overprint, ΛΗΜΝΟΣ, was also ordered for use {{on the island of}} Lemnos, which was occupied in October 1912.
