40|$|A {{substation}} {{is a part}} of {{an electrical}} generation, transmission, and distribution system. Substations generally have switching, protection and control equipment, and transformers. The low voltage distribution networks are supplied from MV/LV substation transformer that represent the last step of bringing transformation to the   low voltage and ensuring the   protection and monitoring of the network. There are three types of MV/LV substation: <b>pole-mounted</b> <b>transformer</b> substation, the substation in an envelope and substation in masonry. This paper presents a general description for different MV/LV substation and a methodology to design the various elements making up the public distribution substation (choice of the emplacement, engineering, power transformer, choice of MV cells, circuit breakers, fuses, disconnect   switch, conductors, [...] . etc). </span...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{interaction}} of rocket-triggered lightning with two unenergized power distribution lines of about 800 m length was {{studied at the}} International Center for Lightning Research and Testing in Florida. A horizontally configured line was tested in 2000, and a vertically configured line in 2001, 2002, and 2003. The horizontally and vertically configured lines were equipped with six and four arrester stations, respectively, and, additionally, in 2003, the vertical line with a <b>pole-mounted</b> <b>transformer.</b> During the 2000, 2001, and 2002 experiments, arresters were frequently rendered inoperable by disconnector operation during triggered lightning strokes, {{but there was no}} disconnector operation during the 2003 experiment when the transformer was on the line. In all four years, there were commonly flashovers from the struck phase-conductor to the closest phase-conductor not subjected to direct lightning cur-rent injection. The self-consistency of measurements is assessed via comparison of the injected lightning current with: 1) the total cur-rent flowing to Earth through the multiple line groundings and 2) the total phase-to-neutral current flowing through the line ar-resters and line terminations. This paper is part one of two related papers. Index Terms—Arresters, grounding electrodes, lightning, power distribution lines, power transformers. I...|$|E
50|$|MV lines carry {{generally}} up to 100 kilovolts, {{over a few}} kilometres {{between the}} electricity distribution stations and <b>pole-mounted</b> <b>transformers.</b> Low voltage lines transmit a few hundred volts over a few hundreds of metres, usually from <b>pole-mounted</b> <b>transformers</b> into a home or business.|$|R

50|$|Historically, <b>pole-mounted</b> <b>transformers</b> {{were filled}} with a polychlorinated {{biphenyl}} (PCB) liquid. PCBs persist in the environment and have adverse effects on animals.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pole-mounted</b> <b>transformers</b> {{often include}} {{accessories}} such as surge arresters or protective fuse links. A self-protected transformer includes an internal fuse and surge arrester; other transformers have these components mounted separately outside the tank. <b>Pole-mounted</b> <b>transformers</b> may have lugs allowing direct mounting to a pole, {{or may be}} mounted on crossarms bolted to the pole. Aerial transformers, larger than around 75 kVA, may be mounted on a platform supported {{by one or more}} poles. A three-phase service may use three identical transformers, one per phase.|$|R
50|$|If {{mounted on}} a utility pole, they are called <b>pole-mount</b> <b>transformers.</b> If the {{distribution}} lines are located at ground level or underground, distribution transformers are mounted on concrete pads and locked in steel cases, thus known as pad-mount transformers.|$|R
50|$|The {{transformer}} {{is always}} {{connected to the}} primary distribution lines through protective fuses and disconnect switches. For <b>pole-mounted</b> <b>transformers</b> this usually {{takes the form of}} a 'fused cutout'. An electrical fault causes the fuse to melt, and the device drops open to give a visual indication of trouble. It can also be manually opened while the line is energized by lineworkers using insulated hot sticks.|$|R

50|$|Rural {{services}} normally try {{to minimize}} the number of poles and wires. Single-wire earth return (SWER) is the least expensive, with one wire. It uses higher voltages (than urban distribution), which in turn permits use of galvanized steel wire. The strong steel wire allows for less expensive wide pole spacing. In rural areas a <b>pole-mount</b> <b>transformer</b> may serve only one customer. In New Zealand, Australia, Saskatchewan, Canada, and South Africa, single-wire earth return systems (SWER) are used to electrify remote rural areas.|$|R

50|$|In the United Kingdom, much of {{the rural}} {{electricity}} distribution system is carried on wooden poles. These normally carry electricity at 11 or 33 kV (three phases) from 132 kV substations supplied from pylons to distribution substations or <b>pole-mounted</b> <b>transformers.</b> Wooden poles {{have been used for}} 132kv {{for a number of years}} from the early 1980s one is called the trident they are usually used on short sections, though the line from Melbourne, Cambs to near Buntingford, Herts is quite long. The conductors on these are bare metal connected to the posts by insulators. Wood poles can also be used for low voltage distribution to customers.|$|R

40|$|Squirrel-caused {{power outages}} in Lincoln and Omaha, Nebraska, were {{evaluated}} by examining company power outage reports and by consulting with power company representatives. Reports showed that squirrel-caused outages at <b>pole-mounted</b> <b>transformers</b> were most prevalent during May, June, and October (48 % of total) and between 1 and 4 h after sunrise (38 %), patterns that coincide with squirrel dispersal or morning activity periods. In Lincoln, 1980 and 1981, squirrels caused 177 outages per year, which was 24 % of all outages and 90 % of animal-caused outages. Estimated minimum annual costs were $ 23 364 for repairs, public relations, and lost revenue while meters were not running. In Omaha, 1985 and 1986, squirrels caused 332 outages per year, costing at least $ 47 144 annually. Squirrelcaused outages at substations cost an additional $ 400 (Lincoln) to $ 810 (Omaha) annually. Between 1982 and 1985, squirrel guards were installed on all 13 000 Lincoln transformers at an estimated minimum cost of $ 20 per guard, or $ 260 000 total. Records from Lincoln after all guards were installed (1986 and 1987) indicate that annual costs were reduced 78 % to $ 5148. Life expectancy of the guards is unknown. The extent of squirrel-caused outages and associated costs may vary among cities and regions. Assessment of these outages as described here {{can be used for}} timing biological studies and as a procedural structure for making similar economic assessments in other areas...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} means to evaluate lightning performance of <b>pole-mounted</b> distribution <b>transformers</b> and Medium Voltage (MV) distribution lines. The main intention {{is to provide a}} general bench-mark procedure for analysis of lightning performances of <b>pole-mounted</b> <b>transformers</b> and MV distribution lines and thereby to ensure proper installation and reduction of the high lightning failure rate existing in Sri Lanka. // In installation of HV surge arresters, the separation length between the arrester and the high voltage bushing is of paramount importance. Thus the calculation of the separation lengths and failure rates are first discussed and the drawbacks of the present method of installation are presented. The required separation depends on several factors such as tower configuration, system voltage, tower surge impedance, the length of the earth wire of the arrester etc. Effect of ground flash and residual voltage of arresters impart a considerable contribution to the transformer protection. An alternative approach for this is also presented. The role of the earth resistance and its contribution to High Voltage and Low Voltage failures due to lightning are discussed indicating typical modes of failure. The determination of a safe value for the earth resistance is also presented// Flashover due to lightning induced surge voltages is of paramount importance in evaluating reliability and power quality of Medium Voltage distribution lines. First, analysis has been done on flashovers due to direct lightning. Next a comprehensive analysis has been done to develop a method to evaluate lightning performance against lightning induced flashes. Accuracy of the algorithms to calculate lightning induced line flashes highly depends on parameters such as wave front time of return stroke current, magnitude of the return stroke current and its probability distribution and the speed of the return stroke current. Having selected the most suitable values for these parameters, a technique has been developed to determine line flas hover rates due to induced lightning. Next, cumulative effect of both direct and indirect lightning surges has been discussed. Analysis has been done to study dependence of line flas hover rates on line insulation levels,isokeraunic level, line height, wave front time, corona damping, shielding due to near by objects etc. Variation of line flas hover rates with above parameters has been discussed. Theoretical results have been compared with practical data as a measure to check adequacy of the developed analysis technique. The report finally presents simplified preventive measures that can be implemented in Sri Lanka...|$|R
40|$|The {{contributions}} {{of this article}} are the analysis and economic evaluation of the impact on tank wall losses of a diameter reduction of low-voltage bushings of <b>pole-mounted</b> single-phase distribution <b>transformers.</b> Finite element simulations of 5 - to 167 -kVA transformers were performed. The study was motivated when bushing manufacturers reduced diameter from 4. 6 to 3. 6 cm. Results show that when the diameter of low-voltage bushings is reduced, (i) load losses increase and (ii) total owning cost decreases for transformers up to 15 kVA and increases for transformers of 25 - 167 kVA. The insertion of non-magnetic material between bushing holes is also evaluated. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{harmonic current}} compensation {{of the constant}} DC-capacitor voltage-control (CDCVC) -based strategy of smart chargers for electric vehicles (EVs) in single-phase three-wire distribution feeders (SPTWDFs) under nonlinear load conditions. The basic principle of the CDCVC-based harmonics compensation strategy under nonlinear load conditions is discussed in detail. The instantaneous power flowing into the three-leg pulse-width modulated (PWM) rectifier, which performs as a smart charger, shows that the CDCVC-based strategy achieves balanced and sinusoidal source currents with a unity power factor. The CDCVC-based harmonics compensation strategy does not require any calculation blocks of fundamental reactive, unbalanced active, and harmonic currents. Thus, the authors propose a simplified algorithm to compensate for reactive, unbalanced active, and harmonic currents. A digital computer simulation is implemented to confirm the validity and high practicability of the CDCVC-based harmonics compensation strategy using PSIM software. Simulation results demonstrate that balanced and sinusoidal source currents with a unity power factor in SPTWDFs are obtained on the secondary side of the <b>pole-mounted</b> distribution <b>transformer</b> (PMDT) during both the battery-charging and discharging operations in EVs, compensating for the reactive, unbalanced active, and harmonic currents...|$|R
50|$|In North America and {{countries}} that use their system, the 120/240 V split phase system is used. A <b>pole-mounted</b> distribution <b>transformer</b> usually provides power {{for one or}} two residences. The service drop is made up of two 120 V lines and a neutral line. When these lines are insulated and twisted together, they are referred to as a triplex cable which may contain a supporting messenger cable {{in the middle of the}} neutral conductor to provide strength for long spans. The neutral line from the pole is connected to a ground near the service panel; often a conductive rod driven into the earth. The service drop provides the building with two 120 V lines of opposite phase, so 240 V can be obtained by connecting a load between the two 120 V conductors, while 120 V loads are connected between either of the two 120 V lines and the neutral line. 240 V circuits are used for high-power devices, such as air conditioners, clothes dryers, ovens and boilers, while 120 V circuits are used for lighter loads such as lighting and ordinary small appliance outlets.|$|R
5000|$|Distribution lines use two systems, either grounded-wye ("Y" [...] on {{electrical}} schematics) or delta (Greek letter [...] "Δ" [...] on electrical schematics). A delta system {{requires only}} a conductor {{for each of}} the three phases. A grounded-wye system requires a fourth conductor, the neutral, whose source is the center of the [...] "Y" [...] and is grounded. However, [...] "spur lines" [...] branching off the main line to provide power to side streets often carry only one or two phase wires, plus the neutral. A wide range of standard distribution voltages are used, from 2,400 V to 34,500 V. On poles near a service drop, there is a <b>pole-mounted</b> step-down <b>transformer</b> to provide the required mains voltage. In North America, service drops provide 240/120V split-phase power for residential and light commercial service, using cylindrical single-phase transformers. In Europe and most other countries, 230V three phase (230Y400) service drops are used. The transformer's primary is connected to the distribution line through protective devices called fuse cutouts. In the event of an overload, the fuse melts and the device pivots open to provide a visual indication of the problem. They can also be opened manually by linemen using a long insulated rod called a hot stick to disconnect the transformer from the line.|$|R
5000|$|Both <b>pole-mount</b> and pad-mount <b>transformers</b> {{convert the}} high 'primary' voltage of the {{overhead}} or underground distribution {{lines to the}} lower 'secondary' voltage of the distribution wires inside the building. The primaries use the three-phase system. Main distribution lines always have three wires, while smaller [...] "laterals" [...] (close to the customer) may include one or two phases, used to serve all customers with single-phase power. If three-phase service is desired, one must have a three-phase supply. Primaries provide power at the standard distribution voltages used in the area; these range from as low as 2300 volts to about 35,000 volts depending on local distribution practice and standards; often 11,000 V (50 Hz systems [...] )and 13,800 V (60 Hz) systems are used but many other voltages are standard.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} steel {{tank wall}} losses of <b>pole-mounted</b> single-phase distribution <b>transformers</b> {{due to high}} currents crossing through the bushing holes of the low voltage terminals, and evaluates {{the impact of the}} holes diameter on load losses. The study also includes a description and comparison of analytical and empirical approaches used by other authors. The analysis was performed using simulations obtained by finite element method. The finite element model was validated reproducing results found in literature and simulations obtained for a 37. 5 kVA single-phase transformer model. The study was motivated by a reduction of diameter (from 4. 6 cm to 3. 6 cm) in the bushings supplied by manufacturers that represented a cost reduction. Results show no appreciable change of load losses with 1 cm diameter reduction and consequently the decrease in manufacturing cost means a beneficial impact. © 2010 IEEE...|$|R
