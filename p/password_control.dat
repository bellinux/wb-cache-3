He would become an ardent critic of restricted computer access in the lab, which {{at that time was}} funded primarily by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. When MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science (LCS) installed a <b>password</b> <b>control</b> system in 1977, Stallman found a way to decrypt the passwords and sent users messages containing their decoded password, with a suggestion to change it to the empty string (that is, no password) instead, to re-enable anonymous access to the systems. Around 20% of the users followed his advice at the time, although passwords ultimately prevailed. Stallman boasted of the success of his campaign for many years afterward.|$|E

40|$|The {{security}} of many computer systems {{hinges on the}} secrecy of a single word – if an adversary obtains knowledge of a password, they will {{gain access to the}} resources controlled by this password. Human users are the ‘weakest link ’ in <b>password</b> <b>control,</b> due to our propensity to reuse passwords and to create weak ones. Policies which forbid such unsafe password practices are often violated, even if these policies are well-advertised. We have studied how users perceive their accounts and their passwords. Our participants mentally classified their accounts and passwords into a few groups, based on a small number of perceived similarities. Our participants used stronger passwords, and reused passwords less, in account groups which they considered more important. Our participants thus demonstrated awareness of the basic tenets of password safety, but they did not behave safely in all respects. Almost half of our participants reused {{at least one of the}} passwords in their high-importance accounts. Our findings add to the body of evidence that a typical computer user suffers from ‘password overload’. Our concepts of password and account grouping point the way toward more intuitive user interfaces for passwordand account-management systems. ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{standard}} security {{provided by}} Acrobat PDF {{consists of two}} different methods and two different passwords, user password, which encrypts the file and prevents opening, and owner password, which specifies operations that should be restricted even when the document is decrypted, which can include: printing, copying text and graphics out of the document, modifying the document, or adding or modifying text notes and AcroForm fields. The user <b>password</b> (<b>controls</b> opening) encrypts the file and requires password cracking to defeat, with difficulty depending on password strength and encryption method - it is potentially very secure (assuming good password and encryption method without known attacks). The owner <b>password</b> (<b>controls</b> operations) does not encrypt the file, and instead relies on client software to respect these restrictions, and is not secure. An [...] "owner password" [...] can be removed by many commonly available [...] "PDF cracking" [...] software, including some free online services. Thus, the use restrictions that a document author places on a PDF document are not secure, and cannot be assured once the file is distributed; this warning is displayed when applying such restrictions using Adobe Acrobat software to create or edit PDF files.|$|R

40|$|Textual {{passwords}} {{are often}} the only mechanism used to authenticate users of a networked system. Unfortunately, many passwords are easily guessed or cracked. In an attempt to strengthen passwords, some systems instruct users to create mnemonic phrase-based passwords. A mnemonic password is one where a user chooses a memorable phrase and uses a character (often the first letter) to represent each word in the phrase. In this paper, we hypothesize that users will select mnemonic phrases that are commonly available on the Internet, {{and that it is}} possible to build a dictionary to crack mnemonic phrase-based passwords. We conduct a survey to gather user-generated passwords. We show the majority of survey respondents based their mnemonic passwords on phrases that can be found on the Internet, and we generate a mnemonic password dictionary as a proof of concept. Our 400, 000 -entry dictionary cracked 4 % of mnemonic passwords; in comparison, a standard dictionary with 1. 2 million entries cracked 11 % of <b>control</b> <b>passwords.</b> The usergenerated mnemonic passwords were also slightly more resistant to brute force attacks than <b>control</b> <b>passwords.</b> These results suggest that mnemonic passwords may be appropriate for some uses today. However, mnemonic passwords could become more vulnerable in the future and should not be treated as a panacea...|$|R
