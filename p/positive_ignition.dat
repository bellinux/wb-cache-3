Of these five areas, ceramic manufacturing technology is the pacing item, and is already being addressed by several organizations. Therefore the four remaining areas need immediate attention. Since the lead time involved in engine development and production is long, this technology development should be done concurrently with the AAD engine development. A four year program is outlined which will simultaneously study these first four areas.

40|$|The {{utility of}} a novel {{technique}} for determining the ignition delay in a compression ignition engine has been shown. This method utilises statistical modelling in the Bayesian paradigm to accurately resolve the start of combustion from a band-pass in-cylinder pressure signal. Applied to neat diesel and six biofuels, including four fractionations of palm oil of varying carbon chain length and degree of unsaturation, the relationships between ignition delay, cetane number and oxygen content have been explored. It is noted that the expected negative relationship between ignition delay and cetane number held, as did the <b>positive</b> relationship between <b>ignition</b> delay and oxygen content.

40|$|International audienceWe {{present an}} {{experimental}} study of discharge initiation in a three-electrode configuration consisting of a microhollow cathode discharge (MHCD) and a third planar electrode, biased positively and placed some distance away. This work {{is based on the}} microcathode sustained (MCS) configuration where the MHCD acts as a plasma cathode and enables the generation of a stable, non-equilibrium plasma at high pressure in the volume between the MHCD and the third electrode. Our experiments were carried out in two different set-ups, one using a MHCD as a cathode and another in an equivalent macrocell geometry, easier to implement and operating at lower pressure in which the same phenomena are observed. Consistent with previous modeling results, we find that the plasma column in the volume between the MHCD and the third electrode is characterized by a low reduced electric field, with values similar to those expected for a <b>positive</b> column. The <b>ignition</b> voltage of the plasma column depends on the voltage difference between the MHCD and the third electrode, the MHCD current, and the gas pressure and gap spacing...|$|R

Upgrading {{decreases}} transportation costs, increases storage capacity, and improves combustion properties. The intention of the present work {{was to investigate the}} effect of chemical characteristics and physical characteristics on processing, handling characteristics, combustion, and ash melting, using upgraded biofuels. The raw materials used was spring-harvested reed canary-grass (RCG) and wood residues (stemwood without bark). RCG with different ash contents was upgraded to briquettes and combustion experiments were done in a 180 kW boiler. RCG was found to be a suitable raw material for briquetting and variation in ash content did not affect the briquette quality. Combustion experiments showed that RCG can be burned with good result and the variation in ash content did not effect flue gas emissions. The ash formed during combustion showed a tendency to melt. Estimation of melting behaviour was done by ASTM fusion test, a bench scale fluidised-bed combustion test (5 kW), and by extracting melting behaviours from the ternary diagram SiO 2 -CaO-K 2 O. For RCG with low ash content (3 - 4 %), the tendency to melt was higher compared to RCG with high ash content (5 - 10 %). Wood powder cut in various impact mills and knife mills was characterised using sieve analysis, laser diffraction, image analysis, and a funnel method for measuring the tendency to bridge. The wood powder fuels were then combusted in a 150 kW powder burner to study emissions as a function of particle properties. Sieving and image analysis showed that impact mills produced wood powder with more fine particles than wood powder produced by knife mills. Image analysis showed that particle shapes differed between the two types of mills. The bridging tendency was higher for powder produced by impact mills than by knife mills. Combustion experiments showed that particle characteristics affected fuel feeding, ignition, unburned pollutants, furnace temperature, and content of unburned matter in ash. An increased content of smaller particles had a negative effect on fuel feeding and NO emissions were slightly increased while it had a <b>positive</b> effect on <b>ignition,</b> unburned pollutants (decreased) and content unburned matter (decreased) ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{combustion}} and emission characteristics under various equivalence ratio up to stoichiometric condition were experimentally investigated in a Cl (compression ignition) engine. In order {{to control the}} equivalence ratio, the O- 2 mole fraction of intake gas was reduced from 21 to 11. 16 % by adding only N- 2 to intake gas while the injected fuel quantity was held constant. The test was used a single-cylinder compression ignition (Cl) engine with a displacement volume of 373. 3 cc, a compression ratio of 17. 8, a re-entrant type piston-bowl. The emission measurement instruments consisted of emission bench (MEXA- 9100 D, HORIBA) and smoke meter (AVL- 415 S, AVL). In the result, the maximum IMEP (indicated mean effective pressure) and fuel conversion efficiency gradually decreased when the equivalence ratio was richer. In particular, the stoichiometric condition (i. e. 1. 0 equivalence ratio) had around 15 % and 11 % losses, respectively. The stoichiometric diesel combustion had a <b>positive</b> <b>ignition</b> dwell over the whole operating condition, leading to {{a large amount of}} THC (total hydrocarbons) and CO emission. Especially, the level of IS (indicated specific) -soot for stoichiometric combustion is significantly higher than the maximum level of IS-soot under the same operating condition without reduced O- 2 mole fraction.

40|$|The European Commission Regulations No 692 / 2008 and No 715 / 2007 set the {{regulatory}} framework for type-approval of motor vehicles with respect to emissions from light passenger and commercial vehicles (Euro 5 / 6). One of the applicable tests is the low temperature emission test (Type VI), which is conducted at sub-ambient temperature conditions (- 7 °C). The low temperature emission test is currently required only for vehicles with <b>positive</b> <b>ignition</b> engines. However the Type VI test to diesel vehicles is under consideration, {{mainly because of the}} introduction of the new technologies in diesel engines in order to comply with the Euro 5 / 6 emission standards, of which the efficiency in controlling emission may strongly depend on the ambient temperature. This is especially true for Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) systems and after-treatment systems for Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) that are deactivated or not operate in cold weather conditions, may result in elevated NOx emissions.

40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} {{a system of}} nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations arising {{as a model of}} laminar flames in a premixed reactive gas. The existence of traveling wave solutions has been established for <b>positive</b> <b>ignition</b> temperature by Berestycki, Nicolaenko, and Scheurer and by Terman for zero ignition temperature. Stability and instability of these solutions have been established in various situations by Sivashinsky, Clavin, and recently Terman. Our goal is to study the equations with initial data that are bounded, uniformly continuous, and nonnegative but otherwise arbitrary. We establish the existence of unique global strong solutions satisfying appropriate a priori estimates. With a positivity condition imposed on the initial data for the temperature, we show that the concentration decays exponentially. This result, while easy to obtain, {{plays an important role in}} results that follow. Of greatest physical interest are the cases where ignition occurs precisely at one end. Our main result is that if the average of the initial temperature values at the ends of the chamber is above ignition temperature, then on any ray coming from the ignition end the temperature is uniformly above ignition temperature, and the concentration decays uniformly to zero. We can continually advance the endpoint of this zone of ignition, thus roughly mimicking the motion of traveling wave solutions. We also point out the appropriateness of the averaging condition on the initial temperature and discuss two examples where this averaging condition is not satisfied: in one, we eventually have flame propagation and in the other example we have eventual flame extinguishment on any ray coming from the cold end of the chamber...|$|E

Add to that, we researched to decide the function of Bosnian learners ’ families ’ roles in education and to detect whether this rapport prompts the parents or not. In this study, we held a correspondence with parents by ’ Smart School ’ (e-school). It is called ‘elektroniski dnevnik ’ in Bosnia. Smart School applications are primarily developed for the purpose of better informing parents, having in mind to be short, light and offer more accessible way to obtain information about the marks and the absence of their child. By way of addition, in our research, parents had ability to check grades online through the internet and we sent SMS messages. By these Smart School mails and messages, we daily informed parents about learner’s marks in exams and quizzes, projects, and the learner’s behavioral matters and absence or presence of their children. At the end of this study, we have found that daily interconnection and corresponding with parents can improve the learner’s English markedly.

40|$|AbstractResultsfor {{ignition}} behaviour of pulverised biomass fuels in a 20 litre (L) spherical {{combustion chamber}} are presented and discussed. Four types of biomass currently used in UK utility pulverised fuel boilers {{have been tested}} for ignition behaviour in air, so at 21 %v/v O 2, and also, to assess relative performance under oxy-fuel combustion conditions, in a 21 %v/v O 2, balance carbon dioxide (CO 2) balance mixture (21 Oxy) and a 25 %v/v O 2 mixture (25 Oxy) respectively. Peak pressures (Pmax) during constant volume ignition and combustion with 2500 J and 5000 J igniters were measured and recorded. The pressure ratios (P/R), defined as {{the ratio of the}} maximum pressure (Pmax) to the pressure at the start of ignition (P 0) for each test are reported. A P/R above a threshold of 2. 5 is taken as an indication of <b>positive</b> <b>ignition.</b> All four biomass types ignited nearly as readily in 25 Oxy as in air at a range of fuel concentrations. Ignition was much less readily achieved in 21 Oxy for all fuel concentrations and peak pressures were also generally lower. Results were more erratic with 2500 J igniters compared to 5000 J igniters, suggesting a relatively stronger ignition source is required with these biomass samples than with pulverised coals previously tested; this is tentatively attributed to larger particle sizes and higher moisture contents. Implications for pulverised fuel oxy-fuel combustion applications are: 1) a primary recycle (PR) stream with 21 %v/v O 2 would give improved pulverised fuel (PF) milling safety when compared to air firing but reduced ignitability in the burners; 2) a 25 %v/v O 2 primary stream would approach air behaviour in mills and burners. These preliminary results suggest that approximately 25 %v/v O 2 may give air-like performance in oxy-fuel pulverised coal plants using oxy-biomass...|$|E
40|$|Global {{growth in}} the sales of {{light-duty}} diesel-powered vehicles is effectively driven by diesel engines superior fuel economy though concerns implicating emission formations and usage of non-renewable fossil still persist. Such obstacles present a need for {{better understanding of the}} diesel combustion, which will help improve engine efficiency and reduce pollutant emissions. To address this issue, experimental study of in-cylinder combustion processes is conducted in a light-duty diesel engine with focus on flame development transience. A new experimental research facility has been designed and constructed to study transient behaviour of diesel flames during combustion. The facility houses a modified single-cylinder diesel engine that allows optical access to the combustion chamber at realistic engine environment and ambient conditions. Two distinctly different diesel combustion regimes are investigated: one with short injection duration and the other with long injection duration. The first of the combustion regimes consists of short injection duration and long ignition delay ultimately resulting in a <b>positive</b> <b>ignition</b> dwell (fuel injection completes prior to ignition). In this regime, the overall combustion is dominated by premixed burn phase whereby further improvement of efficiency is limited by a drastic increase in in-cylinder pressure. If the problem is severe, undesirable pressure ringing follows the initial pressure rise, which is called diesel knock. The first part of this thesis addresses this issue of knocking in a light-duty diesel engine. In the optical engine, high-speed natural hot soot luminosity imaging was performed to visualise flame behaviour during the knocking cycles. It is found that the diesel flame oscillates against the normal swirl direction and the oscillation frequency matches the frequency of in-cylinder pressure ringing, which is the first observation of such correspondence in a diesel engine. Experimentation with pilot injection showed a remedial effect through elimination of pressure ringing and dampening of flame oscillation. Such results are connected with a short ignition delay and less intense premixed combustion as shown through a lower pressure rise rate and negative ignition dwell (i. e. mixing-controlled combustion). The second regime investigated in this thesis presents long injection duration through a single-hole injector resulting in a negative ignition dwell (combustion starts prior to the end of injection). This regime is dominated by mixing-controlled combustion phase corresponding to high-load engine operating conditions. Opposed to the short-injection regime with <b>positive</b> <b>ignition</b> dwell, this long-injection regime is characterised by a lifted flame that is under the strong influence of jet-wall interaction during and after the fuel injection. Therefore, the focus of last half of this thesis is on the jet-wall interaction and its impact on lift-off length (i. e. distance between the nozzle to the first detectable flame base within a specified spatial range with respect to the jet trajectory) that is known {{to play an important role}} in pollutants formation. Interaction between the reacting jet and the wall was visualised through hot soot luminosity and hydroxyl radical (OH*) chemiluminescence imaging. An interesting finding from these imaging diagnostics is shortening of the lift-off length against the incoming jet momentum during the fuel injection. This trend is reversed (i. e. the lift-off length increases) only after the end of injection when the jet momentum diminishes. Detailed analysis of temporal evolution of the lift-off length and parametric studies of injection pressure and addition of neighbouring jet suggest that a potential cause for the shortening of the flame base is the redirection of hot combustion gases that are entrained back to the incoming jet, i. e. re-entrainment. The findings in this thesis help understand the current constraints in improving engine efficiency and reducing pollutant formation in light-duty diesel engines. It is suggested that at low-load operating conditions, engine developers should limit the pressure rise rate below a certain level so that problematic diesel knock can be avoided. By contrast, at high-load operating conditions, injection pulse width should be controlled to reduce jet-wall interaction as otherwise the pollutants formation would increase with decreasing lift-off length...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} self-organized {{criticality}} was proposed {{as an explanation}} for the occurrence of fractal structures in diverse natural phenomena. Roughly speaking the idea behind self-organized criticality is that a dynamic drives a system towards a stationary state that is characterized by power law correlations in space and time. We study two of the most famous models that were introduced as models exhibiting self-organized criticality. The first of them is the forest fire model. In a forest fire model each site (vertex) of a graph is either vacant or occupied by a tree. Vacant sites get occupied according to independent rate 1 Poisson processes. Independently, at each sites ignition (by lightning) occurs according to independent Poisson processes that have rate Lambda> 0. When a site is ignited its whole cluster of occupied sites becomes vacant instantaneously. It is known that infinite volume forest fire processes exist for all ignition rates Lambda> 0. The proof of existence is rather abstract, and does not imply uniqueness. Nor does the construction answer the question whether infinite volume forest fire processes are measurable with respect to their driving Poisson processes. Motivated by these questions, we show the almost sure infinite volume convergence for forest fire models with respect to their driving Poisson processes. Our proof is quite general and covers all graphs with bounded vertex, all <b>positive</b> <b>ignition</b> rates Lambda> 0, and a quite large set of initial configurations. One of the main ingredients of the proof is an estimate for the decay of the cluster size distribution in a forest fire model. For Gamma> 0, we study the probability that the cluster at site x and time t>=Gamma is larger than m, conditioned on the configuration of some further clusters at time t. We show that as m tends to infinity, this conditional probability decays to zero. The convergence is uniform in the choice of the site x, the time t, and the configuration of the further clusters we condition on. Being a consequence of almost sure infinite volume convergence, we obtain uniqueness and measurability with respect to the driving Poisson processes, and the Markov property. The second model in focus is the Abelian sandpile model. Let Lambda be a finite subset of the two-dimensional integer lattice. We consider the following sandpile model on Lambda: each vertex in Lambda contains a sandpile with a height between one and four sand grains. At discrete times, we choose a site v in Lambda randomly and add a sand grain at the site v. If after adding the sand grain the height at the site v is strictly larger than four, then the site topples. That is, four sand grains leave the site v, and each distance-one-neighbour of v gets one of these grains. If after toppling the site v there are other sites with a height strictly larger than four, we continue by toppling these sites until we obtain a configuration where all sites have a height between one and four. We study the scaling limit for the height one field in such a sandpile model. More precisely, we identify the scaling limit for the covariance of having height one at two macroscopically distant sites. We show that this scaling limit is conformally covariant. Furthermore, we show a central limit theorem for the sandpile height one field. Our results are based on a representation of the height one joint intensities that is close to a block-determinantal structure...|$|E
