5|$|Although a Senate seat {{would be}} {{disposed}} of by the Ohio General Assembly after the resignation of John Sherman to become Treasury Secretary, Hayes needed Garfield's expertise {{to protect him from}} the agenda of a hostile Congress, and asked him not to seek it.

When Congress debated what became the Bland-Allison Act, to have the government purchase large quantities of silver and strike it into fully legal tender dollar coins, Garfield fought against this deviation from the gold standard, but it was enacted over Hayes's veto in February 1878.|$|E

5|$|Despite the boasting of Mussolini and {{the fury}} of Churchill, the loss of Tug Argan and {{consequently}} Somaliland was not of the greatest strategic importance. Certainly it was a blow to British <b>prestige</b> <b>and</b> pride, but Somaliland was one of Britain's lesser regions of value and could be affordably lost. In fact, Britain incurred monetary gains after being relieved of the necessity to station an expensive garrison there. But the impact could have been far greater if the Italians had managed to move faster after the battle. Heavy rains and difficulties supplying the troops damaged these efforts, as well as removed any chance of a sizable strategic victory.|$|E

While European powers attempted to retain some or all of their colonial empires, their losses of <b>prestige</b> <b>and</b> resources during the war rendered this unsuccessful, leading to decolonisation.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the chiefs}} {{respected}} Atangana as their spokesman and leader, and the Beti at large deferred to him <b>prestige</b> <b>and</b> power. A {{new system of}} status had evolved under his rule: a cadre of minor bureaucrats, envoys, interpreters, and office staff worked for Atangana and the other chiefs independent of the French government and were completely dependent on the chiefs. Atangana set up a private police force, for example, known as the fulus in Ewondo. The entire class recognised its reliance on the chiefs and gave them loyalty in exchange for protection and pay, and the chiefs relied on these functionaries to swiftly fulfill their duties to the French regime.|$|E

5|$|Pope Clement VIII died in March 1605. The 62 {{cardinal}} electors who {{met in the}} conclave {{to elect}} his successor were split among various factions roughly equally divided between loyalty to France and to Spain. In addition to the secular politics that influenced these papal elections, during this period they were marked by a strategy among elite families to acquire <b>prestige</b> <b>and</b> power. These strategies often played out over several generations through patronage and the accumulation of wealth, and bestowing favours on family members once an individual's election to the papacy was expected.|$|E

Argentine naval units assisted failed revolts in Argentina, but the continuing acrimony with and naval acquisitions of Chile meant this had little effect.|$|E

40|$|Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT; Lent, Brown & Hackett, 1994) {{provides}} a framework for understanding career development, taking into account background and contextual variables using a social cognitive perspective. Given SCCT’s focus on both personal and contextual factors, it has been widely applied to understanding the career development of ethnic minorities and women. This study extends the SCCT framework by testing the SCCT career choice model with variables defined along the prestige dimension, {{in a sample of}} 198 African American college women. Path analysis results supported SCCT propositions for the relations of <b>prestige</b> self-efficacy <b>and</b> <b>prestige</b> outcome expectations with prestige of vocational interests, <b>and</b> of <b>prestige</b> outcome expectations <b>and</b> <b>prestige</b> of vocational interests with prestige of choice goals. The relation of prestige self-efficacy to prestige of choice goals was fully mediated by prestige of vocational interests; the relation between <b>prestige</b> outcome expectations <b>and</b> <b>prestige</b> of choice goals was partially mediated by prestige of vocational interests. Contrary to SCCT, the hypothesized relation of prestige self-efficacy to prestige outcome expectations was non-significant. These findings provide preliminary evidence for the utility of SCCT in explaining the development of prestige-related career interests and choice goals among African American women...|$|R
