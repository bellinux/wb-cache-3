25|$|Introducing {{cold water}} into a boiler reduces power, and from the 1920s a variety of heaters were incorporated. The most common type for {{locomotives}} was the exhaust steam feedwater heater that piped some of the exhaust through small tanks mounted {{on top of the}} boiler or smokebox or into the tender tank; the warm water then had to be delivered to the boiler by a small auxiliary steam pump. The rare economiser type differed in that it extracted residual heat from the exhaust gases. An example of this is the <b>pre-heater</b> drum(s) found on the Franco-Crosti boiler.|$|E

40|$|AbstractRenewable energy sources, {{presently}} constituting about 23 % of {{the total}} Italian power production, are featured by very discontinuous supply during the day that, to avoid grid malfunctions, must be compensated by fossil fuelled power plants. The latter must hence be able to rapidly control power supply. This paper proposes a power regulation system for coal power plants, consisting in the bypass of the low pressure <b>pre-heaters</b> {{in order to increase}} the steam flow-rate in turbine. The main advantage of this system is the limited thermo-mechanical stress induced in the <b>pre-heaters.</b> The solution effectiveness is investigated through a Matlab-Simulink model...|$|R

50|$|A {{slightly}} more successful adoption {{was the use}} of hybrid water-tube / fire-tube systems.

50|$|To {{facilitate}} rapid catapult launches {{and eliminate}} the necessity of time-consuming engine warm-ups, up to eight aircraft were {{to be kept in}} readiness aboard the German carriers on their hangar decks by the use of steam <b>pre-heaters.</b> These would keep the aircraft engines at an operational temperature of 70 C. In addition, engine oil was to be kept warmed in separate holding tanks, then added via hand-pumps to the aircraft engines shortly before launch. Once the aircraft were raised to flight deck level via the elevators, aircraft oil temperature could be maintained, if need be, through the use of electric <b>pre-heaters</b> plugged into power points on the flight deck. Otherwise, the aircraft could have been immediately catapult-launched as their engines would already have been at or near normal operating temperature.|$|R

50|$|It is a {{standard}} gauge superheated steam tank locomotive with 5 coupled axles, {{which is similar to}} the Henschel-Type E800 but with some notable exceptions. Therefore it is called Henschel-Type Bochum. During World War II the firebox could not be made from copper, and steel was used instead. In 1956 it was modified by installing roller bearings and a mixing <b>pre-heater</b> by Henschel. The steam operated brake was replaced by a pneumatic brake with compressed air.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1950s {{a total of}} 35 class 625 locomotives, of which ten were ex-Class 600 rebuilds, were rebuilt into the class 623. Fitted with the Franco-Crosti boiler (with two <b>pre-heaters</b> placed {{on the sides of}} the boiler), these engines were {{visually}} distinctive. The design was not successful, and these engines were all withdrawn by the early 1970s, with none surviving into preservation.|$|R
50|$|In cold ambient {{conditions}} the friction caused by viscous engine oil causes a high {{load on the}} starting system. Another problem is the reluctance of the fuel to vaporise and combust at low temperatures. Oil dilution systems were developed (mixing fuel with the engine oil), and engine <b>pre-heaters</b> were used (including lighting fires under the engine). The Ki-Gass priming pump system was used to assist starting of British engines.|$|R
50|$|Applications:There is a {{wide range}} of {{applications}} for rising tube evaporators, including effluent treatment, production of polymers, food production, thermal desalination, pharmaceuticals, and solvent recovery.Aschner, F.S. & Schaal, M. & Hasson, D. (1971). “Large Long-Tube Evaporators for Seawater Distillation. In terms of applications within these industries, rising tube evaporators are mainly used as reboilers for distillation columns, or as pre-concentrators or flash evaporators or <b>pre-heaters</b> designed to remove volatile components prior to stripping.|$|R
50|$|In {{relation}} to that, the Artisan Rising Film Evaporator {{is designed to}} eliminate {{the majority of the}} volatile components before stripping and is usually used as a flash evaporator or <b>pre-heater.</b> This design allows the operator to control the feed rate or steam rate in order to remove residues, to adjust to the product behaviour, and to maximise steam economy. This evaporator is appropriate for high temperature application and materials with high viscosity that has a propensity to foul the transfer surfaces.|$|E
50|$|The boiler of the Class 690 was {{replaced}} by the one fitted on the Class 746 locomotives; the trailing axle {{was replaced}} by a Bissel truck, to sustain the weight of the new, larger firebox, and a Nielebock-Knorr <b>pre-heater</b> was added. The 33 locomotives were rebuilt, part by the FS workshops, and part by the Ernesto Breda company.Initially they would have received the same tender designed for the Class 695, but in the end an enlarged version of the standard FS bogie tender was fitted.|$|E
50|$|In 1942 five 740 (numbers 339, 367, 392, 396 and 405) were rebuilt with a Franco-Crosti boiler, {{and fitted}} with a {{streamlined}} casing (more for aesthetical reasons than for any aerodynamic advantages). In 1951 these locomotives (with the casing removed) were renumbered into the FS Class 743, and 88 more were rebuilt until 1953. A modified version, with a single <b>pre-heater</b> under the boiler (instead of two placed alongside it), was classified as FS Class 741, and 81 of them were rebuilt between 1958 and 1960.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Heat {{recovery}} is {{the capture of}} energy contained in fluids otherwise that would be lost from a facility. Heat sources may include heat pumps, chillers, steam condensate lines, hot flue gases from boiler, hot air associated with kitchen and laundry facilities, exhaust gases of the engines, power-generation equipment. Helical coil heat exchanger {{is one of the}} devices which are used for the heat recovery system. A heat exchanger is a device used to transfer heat between two or more fluids with different temperatures for various application including power plants, nuclear reactors, refrigeration & air condition system, automotive industries, heat recovery system, chemical processing and food industries. Common examples of heat exchangers in everyday use are air <b>pre-heaters</b> and conditioners, automobile radiators, condensers, evaporators, and coolers In present paper analysis of counter flow heat exchanger is done and then variations of various dimensionless numbers i. e.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this master thesis is {{modeling}} of the process system in a boiling water reactor, and in particular Ringhals 1. The modeling is done in Dymola 6. 1. The main reason for the project is that Solvina AB would like to examine the possibilities for simulating the entire system around the reactor, including steam system, turbines, <b>pre-heaters</b> and the feedwater pumps. The ultimate goal for the project {{was to have a}} working model for the entire BWR-system which responds realistically to a large transient for which measurement data are available. This goal was only reached partially, like the transient could not be implemented in a satisfying way mainly due to computational issues. The model was calibrated against a full power case, and verified against a case with a reduced power and some other circumstances with good results. A small transient was also introduced in the model to show that such a transient can be handled it in a realistic way...|$|R
