40|$|Jtatients {{with diverse}} {{pulmonary}} disorders, {{with or without}} significant hypoxemia at ground level, have many opportunities for increased mobility and travel. These have developed from recent advances in physio-logic assessments, drug therapy, oxygen delivery systems and lightweight <b>portable</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>units,</b> and pulmonary rehabilitation programs with pro-active at-titudes shared by patients and health care-givers. The wider physical horizons for hypoxemic pulmonary patients may also involve temporary exposures to vari-ous environmental stresses such as altitude hypoxia aboard high-flying, pressurized commercial aircraft.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Lightweight <b>portable</b> <b>oxygen</b> {{systems are}} {{commonly}} preferred by patients over compressed-oxygen systems that use E-size cylinders. However, cost is often {{perceived as a}} barrier to the prescription of lightweight <b>portable</b> <b>oxygen</b> systems. OBJECTIVE: To compare the overall health-care costs of patients with COPD who used lightweight <b>portable</b> <b>oxygen</b> systems to those who used E-cylinder systems. METHODS: All the patients who used either a lightweight <b>portable</b> <b>oxygen</b> system, an E-cylinder system, or an E-cylinder system, then a lightweight <b>portable</b> <b>oxygen</b> system, for at least 12 months during the study period (January 1, 1999, to December 30, 2004) were identified from the administrative database of our regional managed-care system. All direct medical utilization and costs were captured for at least the first 12 months that supplemental oxygen was dispensed. Other clinical factors that affect costs (including age, sex, ethnicity, and comorbidities) were examined and adjusted for. RESULTS: Of the 2, 725 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 203 used only a lightweight <b>portable</b> <b>oxygen</b> system, 2, 268 used only an E-cylinder system, and 254 switched from an E-cylinder system to a lightweight <b>portable</b> <b>oxygen</b> system. Among the patients who used only the lightweight <b>portable</b> <b>oxygen</b> system, the median total medical costs in the first year were nonsignificantly lower than those who used an E-cylinder system ($ 6, 515 /y vs $ 9, 503 /y). The cost difference remained nonsignificant after adjustment for clinical factors. Among the pa-tients who switched from one system to the other in the first year, mean monthly health-care costs while using the lightweight <b>portable</b> <b>oxygen</b> system ($ 1, 428) were not significantly different than when using the E-cylinder system ($ 1, 396). CONCLUSIONS: The type of oxygen system used did not significantly affect overall cost of care in patients with COPD on long-term oxygen therapy. Ke...|$|R

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of patients, mainly COPD and overlap-syndrome patients, simultaneously use home oxygen therapy and noninvasive ventilation (NIV) at night. Usually the oxygen source is a stationary concentrator. We report a patient who, without a medical recommendation, was using a <b>portable</b> <b>oxygen</b> concentrator during nocturnal NIV. In the laboratory, with the patient, we tested the <b>portable</b> <b>oxygen</b> concentrator’s triggering and oxygen delivery, with the supplemental oxygen connected at 3 different positions: near the ventilator, near the exhalation valve, and on the nasal mask port. We also tested the concentrator’s triggering capacity by placing the nasal prongs and the nasal mask independently. We tested ventilator inspiratory pressures of 10, 14, and 18 cm H 2 O, and expiratory pressures of 4 and 6 cm H 2 O.

High Alt Med Biol. 17 : 370 – 374, 2016. —Air travel {{is responsible for}} a reduction of the partial pressure of oxygen (O 2) {{as a result of}} the decreased barometric pressure. This hypobaric hypoxia can be dangerous for passengers with respiratory diseases, requiring initiation or intensification of oxygen therapy during the flight. In-flight oxygen therapy can be provided by <b>portable</b> <b>oxygen</b> concentrators, which are less expensive and more practical than oxygen cylinders, but no study has evaluated their capacity to concentrate oxygen under simulated flight conditions. We tested four <b>portable</b> <b>oxygen</b> concentrators during a bench test study. The O 2 concentrations (FO 2) produced were measured under three different conditions: in room air at sea level, under hypoxia due to a reduction of the partial pressure of O 2 (normobaric hypoxia, which can be performed routinely), and under hypoxia due to a reduction of atmospheric pressure (hypobaric hypoxia, using a chamber manufactured by Airbus Defence and Space). The FO 2 obtained under conditions of hypobaric hypoxia (chamber) was lower than that measured in room air (0. 92 [0. 89 – 0. 92] vs. 0. 93 [0. 92 – 0. 94], p[*]=[*] 0. 029), but only one <b>portable</b> <b>oxygen</b> concentrator was unable to maintain an FO 2 ≥ 0. 90 (0. 89 [0. 89 – 0. 89]).

Almost all <b>portable</b> <b>oxygen</b> concentrators were able to generate a sufficient quantity of O 2 at simulated altitudes of 2438 [*]m and can therefore be used in the aircraft cabin.
