5|$|Adjacent to {{the smaller}} Biblical scenes and {{supported}} by the Ignudi are ten circular parade shields, sometimes described as being <b>painted</b> <b>to</b> resemble bronze. Known examples are actually of lacquered and gilt wood. Each is decorated with a picture drawn from the Old Testament or the Book of Maccabees from the Apocrypha.|$|E
5|$|Some areas were, in fact, {{decorated}} with gold: the shields between the Ignudi and the columns between the Prophets and Sibyls. It seems {{very likely that}} the gilding of the shields was part of Michelangelo's original scheme, since they are <b>painted</b> <b>to</b> resemble {{a certain type of}} parade shield, a number of which still exist and are decorated in a similar style with gold.|$|E
5|$|The Armory's {{entrance}} {{hung with}} banners <b>painted</b> <b>to</b> replicate Mr. Schwarzman's sprawling Park Avenue apartment. A brass band and children clad in military uniforms ushered in guests. A huge portrait of Mr. Schwarzman, which usually hangs {{in his living}} room, was shipped in for the occasion.|$|E

5|$|The {{members of}} Aerosmith {{participated in a}} special sneak preview event at the Hard Rock Cafe in New York City on June 27, 2008, {{allowing}} attendees {{to ask questions and}} try out the game. Target had Chip Ganassi's #40 car, driven by Dario Franchitti, <b>painted</b> <b>to</b> celebrate the release of Guitar Hero: Aerosmith for a NASCAR race on June 29, 2008.|$|E
5|$|According to Méliès's recollections, much of {{the unusual}} cost of A Trip to the Moon {{was due to the}} {{mechanically}} operated scenery and the Selenite costumes in particular, which were made for the film using cardboard and canvas. Méliès himself sculpted prototypes for the heads, feet, and kneecap pieces in terra cotta, and then created plaster molds for them. A specialist in mask-making used these molds to produce cardboard versions for the actors to wear. One of the backdrops for the film, showing the inside of the glass-roofed workshop in which the space capsule is built, was <b>painted</b> <b>to</b> look like the actual glass-roofed studio in which the film was made.|$|E
5|$|Although {{initially}} {{planned for}} an East Coast shoot, The Judy Garland Show was taped in Studio 43 at CBS Television City in Los Angeles. The network {{had gone to}} great expense to prepare the studio, including an estimated $100,000 to raise the stage and install a separate revolving stage. Garland's dressing room was a 110ft × 40ft trailer which had been decorated as a replica of her newly purchased Brentwood home. The corridor that led from her dressing room to the stage was <b>painted</b> <b>to</b> resemble the Yellow Brick Road from The Wizard of Oz.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to being used as {{the exterior of the}} school, Studio C holds sets for the school's entrance foyer, the gymnasium, the media lab and a hallway with lockers. As the series progressed and the budget increased, a stairway and balcony was installed in the foyer in an attempt to get characters off the floor and not all appear in the same geometric plane. For the first few seasons, the gym floor was made of real wooden floorboards; due to warping, it was replaced by concrete <b>painted</b> <b>to</b> look like wood.|$|E
5|$|In many {{recreational}} diving {{settings where}} air and nitrox are the widely used gases, nitrox cylinders are {{identified with a}} green stripe on yellow background. Aluminium diving cylinders may be painted or anodized and when anodized may be coloured or left in their natural silver. Steel diving cylinders are usually <b>painted,</b> <b>to</b> reduce corrosion, often yellow or white to increase visibility. In some industrial cylinder identification colour tables, yellow shoulders means chlorine and more generally within Europe it refers to cylinders with toxic and/or corrosive contents; but this is of no significance in scuba since gas fittings would not be compatible.|$|E
5|$|Stainless steel {{provided}} {{many benefits}} over traditional wood and hardened steel for railroad carbodies; {{it was a}} lighter and stronger material, and its natural silver appearance and resistance to corrosion meant {{that it would not}} have to be <b>painted</b> <b>to</b> protect it from the weather. Since the carbody was much lighter than similar cars, it would be able to carry a higher revenue load for the same cost.|$|E

5|$|The entire {{movie was}} sketched out via {{hand-drawn}} storyboards and then re-created as computer-generated 3D animatics {{with all of}} the 2D background photographs digitally <b>painted</b> <b>to</b> resemble the 1939 setting. With the animatics as a guide, grids were created to map camera and actor movements with digital characters standing in for the real actors. The grids were made into actual maps on the blue screen stage floor to help the actors move around invisible scenery.|$|E
5|$|The {{sunflowers}} were <b>painted</b> <b>to</b> {{decorate the}} walls in anticipation of Gauguin's visit, and Van Gogh placed individual works around the Yellow House's guest room in Arles. Gauguin was deeply impressed and later acquired two of the Paris versions. After Gauguin's departure, Van Gogh imagined the two major versions of the sunflowers as wings of the Berceuse Triptych, and included them in his Les XX in Brussels exhibit. Today the major pieces of the series are among his best known, celebrated for the sickly connotations of the colour yellow and its tie-in with the Yellow House, the expressionism of the brush strokes, and their contrast against often dark backgrounds.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} several alumni owned {{vehicles}} that are <b>painted</b> <b>to</b> resemble the Wreck. These vehicles mimic {{the look and}} feel of the Reck but are not the Ramblin' Wreck. One of the most famous instances of mistaken identity occurred in 1988. A father-son duo of Georgia Tech alums attempted to lead the Tech football team onto the field at Sanford Stadium in Athens. After getting inside of the stadium with their gold 1924 Ford Model T, the two were finally stopped by Georgia officials who were informed the real Ramblin' Wreck had remained in Atlanta.|$|E

5|$|A {{man with}} a tattooed tree {{on his chest and}} back is {{introduced}} in the opening minutes of Carnivàles pilot episode, and appears in many other Avataric visions and dreams: in Ben's and Brother Justin's common recurring dreams chasing Henry Scudder in a cornfield, in Ben's microsleep-like visions, in Sofie's visions of the rape of her mother, and in an extended vision of Brother Justin foreshadowing his dark future. Ben encounters a little boy with a similar tree <b>painted</b> <b>to</b> his chest and back late in Season 1. Brother Justin finds this tree grown on a hill early in Season 2, which prompts him to get his chest and back tattooed accordingly. The tree is also depicted in the show's Gospel of Matthias book, in a painting at the Templar Hall in Loving, New Mexico, and on many images in the room of Templar chaplain Kerrigan. Management and Wilfred Talbot Smith imply the tree's significance for the resolution of Carnivàle.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage for {{aircraft}} {{is complicated by}} the fact that the aircraft's background varies widely, depending on the location of the observer, the nature of the background and the aircraft's motion. For this reason, military aircraft were often <b>painted</b> <b>to</b> match the sky when viewed from below, and to either match the ground or break up the aircraft's outline when viewed from above. This is a form of countershading, likely to work best on aircraft such as heavy bombers that do not do fly inverted during combat. Because of the way light hits it, patterns of dark and light will often be present on an aircraft even if it is entirely one color, making it easier to see Reflections and specular highlights can be counteracted by painting an aircraft in neutral shades with a non-reflective, matte finish. There is a trade-off between the effectiveness of camouflage and the size of recognition markings: larger markings reduce the risk of friendly fire through misrecognition, but compromise camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Gaga, with {{shoulder}} and facial protrusions (prosthetic makeup mimicking subdermal implants) walks in {{a seemingly endless}} black space, where people are {{on their hands and}} knees in an organized pattern. She raises her hand and crouches down to join them. When the first verse begins, everyone dances to choreography. The scenes alternate between the dance, and Gaga singing on her throne in space. In the second verse, Gaga and Rico are in tuxedos, with her face <b>painted</b> <b>to</b> mirror his. Alternating clips show Gaga caressing and attempting to dance with him while he stays expressionless and motionless for the most part. When the chorus plays for the second time, Gaga sings in a room of mirrors, with her head displayed in a glass box among oddly distorted mannequin heads. In the succeeding shots, she is once again shown on her throne giving birth to more members of the new race. After choreographed routines by Gaga and her dancers, they all gather in a circle and embrace in a hug.|$|E

5|$|In the Age of Sail, {{deception}} {{was often}} used by ships, and paint was applied ad hoc by ships' captains for temporary tactical advantage. A ship might be <b>painted</b> <b>to</b> look like another, {{it might have}} its cannon ports hidden by painted canvas to look harmless, or it might have additional cannon ports painted on to appear more powerful. For example, {{in one of his}} battles during 1778–1782, American privateer Jonathan Haraden hid the guns of his ship the General Pickering, to appear {{as if it were a}} slow merchant ship. Haraden allowed his ship to be approached at close range by a much faster British privateer, then he quickly pulled the painted canvas away and delivered a full broadside, capturing the enemy.|$|E
5|$|On 10 January 1994 a press {{reception}} {{to announce}} The Division Bell and world tour {{was held at}} a former US Naval Air Station in North Carolina, in the US. A purpose-built Skyship 600 airship, manufactured in the UK, toured the US until it returned to Weeksville, and was destroyed by a thunderstorm on 27 June. Pieces of the aircraft were sold as souvenirs. The band held another reception, in the UK, on 21 March. This time they used an A60 airship, translucent, and <b>painted</b> <b>to</b> look like a fish, which took journalists {{on a tour of}} London. The airship, which was lit internally so it glowed in the night sky, was also flown in northern Europe.|$|E
5|$|Pandora Crowned by the Seasons is {{an unusual}} composition, <b>painted</b> <b>to</b> {{resemble}} a bas-relief in which the different elements are emerging from a flat background. The figure of Pandora stands in the centre, with Vulcan {{to one side and}} Venus and Cupid to the other, each leaning away from her; the figures of Vulcan and Venus, along with the four figures representing the seasons in the upper corners of the canvas, create a diamond shape around Pandora. The foot of Vulcan rests upon the picture frame, a favourite device of Rubens; elements of the picture's composition are also taken from an 1817 engraving on the same subject, drawn by Etty's fellow York artist John Flaxman and engraved by William Blake. As with all Etty's history paintings from this time on, he worked by painting the figures first, and only filling in the background once the figures were complete.|$|E
