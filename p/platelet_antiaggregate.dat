Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is {{the leading}} cause of death worldwide. Its {{prevention}} emphasizes three aspects: not smoking, physical activity and a healthy diet. Recently, we screened the antithrombotic activity of a selected group of fruits and vegetables. Among them, tomato showed an important effect. The aim of this study was to evaluate and characterize the platelet antiaggregatory activity of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.). For this, we obtained aqueous and methanolic tomato extracts and evaluated the effect of pH (2 and 10) and temperature (22, 60 and 100 degrees C) on this activity. Furthermore, in order to isolate the antiaggregant principle, we separated tomato extracts into several fractions (A-D) by size exclusion chromatography. In addition, we evaluated the <b>platelet</b> <b>antiaggregating</b> activity ex vivo in Wistar rats. Aqueous and methanolic extracts of tomato treated at 22, 60 and 100 degrees C and pH 2 and 10 still inhibited platelet aggregation (in vitro). Moreover, it was noted that one of the fractions (fraction C), from both aqueous and methanolic extracts, presented the highest activity (similar to 70 % inhibition of platelet aggregation) and concentration dependently inhibited platelet aggregation significantly compared with control (P< 0. 05). These fractions did not contain lycopene but presented two peaks of absorption, at 210 and 261 nm, compatible with the presence of nucleosides. In rats treated with tomato macerates, a mild <b>platelet</b> <b>antiaggregating</b> effect ex vivo was observed.

In conclusion, CHD patients showed, at rest, an abnormal neutrophil activation and a lower antioxidant status.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The aim of {{this study}} was to compare, in dogs, the {{antithrombotic}} activity of aspirin and the murine monoclonal antibody P 37, which inhibits platelet aggregation and fibrinogen binding to activated platelets. Background. The antithrombotic activity of P 37 has been somewhat predictable, given its in vitro <b>platelet</b> <b>antiaggregating</b> activity and localization at or very near the fibrinogen binding site in the platelet fibrinogen receptor, the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa or integrin alphaIIb-beta 3. Methods. The monoclonal antibody P 37 of the immunogammaglobulin- 1 isotype was prepared according to previously described immunization and fusion protocols and screening assays. To compare its antiaggregating capacity with that of aspirin, experimental thrombosis was induced in all dogs by means of direct current applied to the carotid artery. Autologous platelets had previously been labeled with indium- 111 oxine. The dogs were assigned to three groups: group I (n = 18) was the control group; group II (n = 12) was treated orally with 5 mg of aspirin/kg body weight per day for 7 days before induction of thrombosis, and group III (n = 10) was treated intravenously with a single dose of P 37 (0. 8 mg/kg). Results. The indium- 111 oxine activity deposited in the thrombi was 12. 94 ± 12. 83 % (mean ± SD) in group I, 3. 55 ± 2. 99 % in group II and 0. 03 ± 0. 03 % in group III. The differences between groups were always statistically significant (p < 0. 05). Conclusions. We conclude that a single dose (0. 8 mg/kg) of P 37 in a canine model of arterial thrombosis is ~ 100 times more efficient than the administration of aspirin (5 mg/kg per day) in preventing platelet deposition during thrombus formation...|$|R
40|$|Hydroxytyrosol acetate (HT-AC) is a {{polyphenol}} {{present in}} {{virgin olive oil}} (VOO) at a proportion similar to hydroxytyrosol (HT) (160 - 479 μmol/kg oil). The present {{study was designed to}} measure the in vitro <b>platelet</b> <b>antiaggregating</b> activity of HT-AC in human whole blood, and compare this effect with that of HT and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). The experiments were designed according to the standard procedure to investigate the activity of ASA. HT-AC and HT inhibited platelet aggregation induced by ADP, collagen or arachidonic acid in both whole blood and platelet-rich plasma (PRP). ASA and HT-AC had a greater effect in whole blood than in PRP when ADP or collagen was used as inducer. ASA and HT-AC had a greater effect in PRP+leucocytes than in PRP alone. All three compounds inhibited platelet thromboxane B 2 and leucocyte 6 -keto-prostaglandin F 1 α (6 -keto-PF 1 α) production. The thromboxane/ 6 -keto-PGF 1 α inhibition ratio (as an indirect index of the prostanoid equilibrium) was 10. 8 (SE 1) for HT-AC, 1. 0 (SE 0. 1) for HT and 3. 3 (SE 0. 2) for ASA. All three compounds stimulated nitric oxide production, although HT was a weaker effect. In our experiments only concentrations higher than 500 μM (HT) or 1 mM (HT-AC and ASA) inhibited 3 -nitrotyrosine production. All three compounds inhibited the production of TNFα by leucocytes, with no significant differences between them.

40|$|Ticlopidine {{hydrochloride}} (TICLID (R)) is a <b>platelet</b> <b>antiaggregating</b> agent {{whose use}} as a potent antithrombotic pharmaceutical ingredient is widespread, even though this drug has not been well characterized in the solid state. Only the crystal phase used for drug product manufacturing is known. Here, a new polymorph of ticlopidine hydrochloride was discovered and its structure was determined. While the antecedent polymorph crystallizes in the triclinic space group P (1) over bar, the new crystal phase was solved in the monoclinic space group P 2 (1) /c. Both polymorphs crystallize as racemic mixtures of enantiomeric (ticlopidine) (+) cations. Detailed geometrical and packing comparisons between the crystal structures of the two polymorphs have allowed us to understand how different supramolecular architectures are assembled. It was feasible {{to conclude that the}} main difference between the two polymorphs is a rotation of about 120 degrees on the bridging bond between the thienopyridine and o-chlorobenzyl moieties. The differential o-chlorobenzyl conformation is related to changeable patterns of weak intermolecular contacts involving this moiety, such as edge-to-face Cl center dot center dot center dot pi and C-H center dot center dot center dot pi interactions in the new polymorph and face-to-face pi center dot center dot center dot pi contacts in the triclinic crystal phase, leading to a symmetry increase in the ticlopidine hydrochloride solid state form described {{for the first time in}} this study. Other conformational features are slightly different between the two polymorphs, such as the thienopyridine puckerings and the o-chlorophenyl orientations. These conformational characteristics were also correlated to the crystal packing patterns.

40|$|Recently most {{interest}} {{has been focused}} on active compounds extracted from natural sources. This {{is due to the fact}} that many of these natural products in plants of medicinal value can offer new sources of drugs. The genus Salvia from the Lamiaceae family has numerous different species - about 900 species- which are extensively distributed in various regions of the world. Many Salvia species are well-studied and widely used in traditional medicine. Plants belonging to the genus Salvia are of particular interest, due to the wide variety of secondary metabolites produced in these plants, such as flavonoids, tannins and terpenoids. The terpenoid class, extracted from Salvia, includes a wide range of mono-, di-, tri-, sesqui- and tetraterpenoids. Many diterpenoids and triterpenoids, isolated from plants of several species of the genus Salvia, have been investigated for their pharmacological activities: analgesic; anti-inflammatory; hemostatic; antioxidant; antimicrobial and as an antitumoral remedy. It has been widely shown that many terpenoid compounds have significant anti-inflammatory effects. For this reason, they are potential molecules for the development of new drugs especially designed for the treatment and/or control of chronic inflammatory states such as rheumatism, asthma, inflammatory bowel diseases, atherosclerosis, etc. Some di- and triterpens from Salvia ssp are able to influence the central nervous system (CNS). In this thesis, the pharmacological effects of bioactive diterpenoids and triterpenoids from the Salvia species are investigate. In a screening programme on Salvia medicinal plants, like S. divinorum, S. cinnabarine and S. jamensis, we have find interesting biological effects. Following anecdotal reports that extracts of Salvia divinorum may possess antidiarrhoeal activity and because !-opioid receptors may modulate intestinal peristalsis we investigated the effect of Salvia divinorum, and its main active ingredient, salvinorin A, on myenteric cholinergic transmission. For this purpose we evaluated the effect of a standardized extract from Salvia divinorum leaves (SDE) and of isolated salvinorin A on the contractions elicited either by electrical stimulation or by exogenous acetylcholine in the guinea-pig ileum. These observations strongly support the hypothesis that SDE inhibits the twitch response by acting prejunctionally rather than through a direct action on intestinal smooth muscle. The hallucinogenic herb Salvia divinorum exerted inhibitory effects on enteric cholinergic transmission in 6 the guinea-pig ileum through activation of prejunctional !-opioid receptors. Salvinorin A may be the chemical constituent responsible for this activity. These results could provide the pharmacological basis underlying its traditional antidiarrhoeal use. During this PhD project the author has studied the effects in vivo of a new diterpenoid compound 3, 4 -secoisopimar- 4 (18), 7, 15 -triene- 3 -oic acid (CMP 1) from Salvia cinnabarina. The possibility that CMP 1, like other isolated diterpenoids, may affect the CNS, was the main aim of these investigations. A putative anxiolytic and antidepressive activity of CMP 1 were studied in the elevated plus-maze test and in the forced swimming test. Furthermore, CMP 1 was administered after a pre-treatment with pentobarbital and its effects on sedative activity was monitored. The CMP 1 was also tested for its effects on spontaneous motor activity (total motility and locomotion) and several models of nociception have been used to examine the potential analgesic effects. These studies demonstrate for the first time that CMP 1 has pronounced CNS depressant properties, manifested as antinociception, sedation and axiolitic effects. In another study we evaluated the effect of CMP 1 on arterial blood pressure in anaesthetized rats. On different groups of them treated with the ganglion-blocking agent chlorisondamine, the effect of CMP 1 was evaluated before and following an infusion of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME. Intravenous administration of CMP 1 led to a fall in mean arterial blood pressure that was not modified by treatment of the rat with chlorisondamine nor with L-NAME. The results demonstrate, for the first time, a hypotensive effect of CMP 1 due to a peripheral mechanism but independent of endothelial nitric oxide release. The chemical constituents of Salvia x jamensis J. Compton and their <b>platelet</b> <b>antiaggregating</b> activity in vitro were also investigated. The surface exudate of Salvia x jamensis J. Compton, obtained by rinsing the plant material with methylene chloride and terpenic compounds 1 - 7 isolated have been tested on ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Among all the tested compounds, isopimaric acid 2 showed a significant concentration-dependent antiaggregating activity when ADP (3 "M) was used as agonist on rat platelets. Conversely, a new clerodane derivate 1 increased ADP– induced platelet aggregation...|$|R
40|$|Thienopyridine <b>antiaggregating</b> <b>platelet</b> agents (clopidogrel and prasugrel) act as {{irreversible}} P 2 Y 12 receptor inhibitors. They {{are used}} with aspirin to prevent thrombotic complications after an {{acute coronary syndrome}} or percutaneous coronary intervention. A large interindividual variability in response to clopidogrel {{and to a lesser}} extent to prasugrel is observed and may be related to their metabolism. Clopidogrel and prasugrel are indeed prodrugs converted into their respective active metabolites by several cytochromes P 450 (CYPs). Besides clopidogrel inactivation (85 %) by esterases to the carboxylic acid, clopidogrel is metabolized by CYPs to 2 -oxo-clopidogrel (15 %) and further metabolized to an unstable but potent platelet-aggregating inhibitor. Prasugrel is more potent than clopidogrel with a better bioavailability and lower pharmacodynamic variability. Prasugrel is completely converted by esterases to an intermediate oxo-metabolite (R- 95913) further bioactivated by CYPs. Numerous clinical studies have shown the influence of CYP 2 C 19 polymorphism on clopidogrel antiplatelet activity. Moreover, unwanted drug-drug pharmacokinetic interactions influencing CYP 2 C 19 activity and clopidogrel bioactivation such as with proton pump inhibitors remain a matter of intense controversy. Several studies have also demonstrated that CYP 3 A 4 / 5 and CYP 1 A 2 are important in clopidogrel bioactivation and should also be considered as potential targets for unwanted drug-drug interactions. Prasugrel bioactivation is mainly related to CYP 3 A 4 and 2 B 6 activity and therefore the question of the effect of drug-drug interaction on its activity is open. The purpose of this review is to critically examine the current literature evaluating the influence of genetic and environmental factors such as unwanted drug-drug interaction affecting clopidogrel and prasugrel antiplatelet activity...|$|R
