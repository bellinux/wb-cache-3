5|$|The {{strength}} of diffusion damping is calculated by a mathematical expression for the damping factor, which figures into the Boltzmann equation, an equation which describes the amplitude of perturbations in the CMB. The {{strength of}} the diffusion damping is chiefly governed by the distance photons travel before being scattered (diffusion length). The <b>primary</b> <b>effects</b> on the diffusion length are from {{the properties of the}} plasma in question: different sorts of plasma may experience different sorts of diffusion damping. The evolution of a plasma may also affect the damping process. The scale on which diffusion damping works is called the Silk scale and its value corresponds to the size of galaxies of the present day. The mass contained within the Silk scale is called the Silk mass and it corresponds to the mass of the galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Although its <b>primary</b> <b>effects</b> were felt in a {{localized}} area of India, {{the outer}} {{fringes of the}} super cyclone impacted Myanmar and Bangladesh. Ten {{people were killed in}} the former, while two were killed in the latter by the storm's rainbands. The storm was the most severe to strike Odisha in the 20th century, raking the state and adjacent areas with high storm surge, powerful winds, and torrential rainfall. The storm's impacts exacerbated the damage caused by a very severe cyclone that struck the same region less than two weeks earlier. The 5–6m (16–20ft) surge brought water up to 35km (20mi) inland, carrying along with it coastal debris and inundating towns and villages. The surge combined with heavy rains to produce widespread flooding, damaging around 1.6million homes and causing rivers to breach 20,005flood embankments. The storm's effects destroyed numerous crops, including sugar cane, rice, and other winter-time harvests. Although estimates of the death toll varied significantly—at times suggesting 30,000fatalities—the Government of India enumerated 9,887fatalities in the country, of which a majority were caused by storm surge; over 8,000deaths occurred in Jagatsinghpur. The total damage cost of the destruction wrought by the super cyclone amounted to US$4.44billion.|$|E

25|$|Alcohol's {{rewarding}} {{and reinforcing}} (i.e., addictive) properties are mediated through {{its effects on}} dopamine neurons in the mesolimbic reward pathway, which connects the ventral tegmental area to the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). One of alcohol's <b>primary</b> <b>effects</b> is the allosteric inhibition of NMDA receptors and facilitation of GABAA receptors (e.g., enhanced GABAA receptor-mediated chloride flux through allosteric regulation of the receptor). At high doses, ethanol inhibits most ligand gated ion channels and voltage gated ion channels in neurons as well. Alcohol inhibits sodium-potassium pumps in the cerebellum and this is likely how it impairs cerebellar computation and body co-ordination.|$|E
25|$|Another {{severe weather}} {{outbreak}} {{took place on}} April 3. However, damaging hail and wind were the <b>primary</b> <b>effects,</b> although 10 tornadoes were reported in Texas, Tennessee, Kentucky, Arkansas and Alabama. Nearly 400 reports of hail were reported throughout the day with the majority occurring during the afternoon hours in Missouri, Illinois, Arkansas and Kentucky with also reports of golf ball to baseball size hail. The majority of the wind reports were from a bow echo that developed across central Kentucky and Tennessee during the evening hours and causing damage to trees, power lines, antennas and trailers. A total of 10 tornadoes were confirmed; {{all of them were}} EF0 or EF1. No fatalities were reported, but several people were injured.|$|E

25|$|Before {{the start}} of the second season, Gough and Millar {{established}} a writing staff to help develop episode stories for the show, which eventually saw the introduction of two characters that would shape Clark's life, Dr. Virgil Swann and Clark's biological father Jor-El. These roles were filled by Christopher Reeve and Terence Stamp, respectively, who were previously known for their respective roles as Superman and his nemesis General Zod in the Superman film series. Special effects company Entity FX became the <b>primary</b> <b>effects</b> unit for the show this season, winning awards for two of the episodes they worked on. Apart from the digital effects team, the series and its actors were nominated for and won various awards as well. Season two performed better than the previous season, averaging 6.3million viewers a week, and placed #113 in the Nielsen ratings, up from #115 the year before.|$|E

In mammals, the <b>primary</b> <b>effects</b> following acute high-dose oral exposure to imidacloprid are mortality, transient cholinergic effects (dizziness, apathy, locomotor effects, labored breathing) and transient growth retardation. Exposure to high doses {{may be associated with}} degenerative changes in the testes, thymus, bone marrow and pancreas. Cardiovascular and hematological effects have also been observed at higher doses. The <b>primary</b> <b>effects</b> of longer term, lower-dose exposure to imidacloprid are on the liver, thyroid, and body weight (reduction). Low- to mid-dose oral exposures have been associated with reproductive toxicity, developmental retardation and neurobehavioral deficits in rats and rabbits.
