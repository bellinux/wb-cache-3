5|$|The {{instrumentation}} included ten smoked paper analog seismometers {{that were}} configured {{to allow for}} 48 hours of continuous single-component data recording. Six digital recorders built by the Institut de Physique du Globe de Strasbourg were also used to record signals from three-component seismometers. Eight of the selected sites were equipped with a vertical component velocity transducer along with an FM telemetry link to transfer data back to a central station where a three-component unit was stationed. There the seismic signals were digitized, along with an internal time signal and an external DCF77 time signal, and stored on magnetic tape. The tapes were then played back and the <b>P-wave</b> and S-wave arrival times were used to automatically determine aftershock locations. Approximately two hundred aftershocks were recorded each day for the first several days of the expedition {{and at the end}} of the recording period in February the equipment was still picking up around 100 shocks per day. The team then set out to determine an accurate velocity model using data from the more accurate telemetry network. The soviet geophysicists detonated 100 kilograms of TNT in a hole drilled near the mainshock epicenter and the resulting shock waves were detected and used to help pinpoint a more accurate crustal velocity value of 5.3 to 5.4km/s.|$|E
25|$|For centuries {{there have}} been anecdotal {{accounts}} of anomalous animal behavior preceding and associated with earthquakes. In cases where animals display unusual behavior some tens of seconds prior to a quake, {{it has been suggested}} they are responding to the <b>P-wave.</b> These travel through the ground about twice as fast as the S-waves that cause most severe shaking. They predict not the earthquake itself — that has already happened — but only the imminent arrival of the more destructive S-waves.|$|E
25|$|The {{data for}} an {{earthquake}} is plotted using a lower-hemisphere stereographic projection. The azimuth and take-off angle {{are used to}} plot the position of an individual seismic record. The take-off angle is the angle from the vertical of a seismic ray as it emerges from the earthquake focus. These angles are calculated from a standard set of tables that describe {{the relationship between the}} take-off angle and the distance between the focus and the observing station. By convention, filled symbols are used to plot data from stations where the <b>P-wave</b> first motion recorded was up (a compressive wave), hollow symbols for down (a tensional wave), with dots for stations with arrivals too weak {{to get a sense of}} motion. If there are sufficient observations, one may draw two well-constrained orthogonal great circles that divide the compressive from the tensional observations and these are the nodal planes. Observations from stations with no clear first motion normally lie close to these planes. By convention the compressional quadrants are colour-filled and the tensional left white. The two nodal planes intersect at the N (neutral)-axis. The P and T axes are also often plotted; with the N axis these three directions respectively match the directions of the maximum, minimum and intermediate principal compressive stresses associated with the earthquake. The P-axis is plotted in the centre of the white segment, the T-axis in the centre of the colour-filled segment.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two types}} of body waves, Pressure waves or Primary waves (<b>P-waves)</b> and Shear or Secondary waves (S-waves). <b>P-waves</b> are {{longitudinal}} waves that involve compression and expansion in the direction that the wave is moving and are always the first waves to appear on a seismogram as they are the fastest moving waves through solids. S-waves are transverse waves that move perpendicular to the direction of propagation. S-waves are slower than <b>P-waves.</b> Therefore, they appear later than <b>P-waves</b> on a seismogram.

2500|$|In a zero {{magnetic}} field, {{there are}} two distinct superfluid phases of 3He, the A-phase and the B-phase. The B-phase is the low-temperature, low-pressure phase which has an isotropic energy gap. The A-phase is the higher temperature, higher pressure phase that is further stabilized by a magnetic field and has two point nodes in its gap. The presence of two phases is a clear indication that 3He is an unconventional superfluid (superconductor), since the presence of two phases requires an additional symmetry, other than gauge symmetry, to be broken. In fact, it is a <b>p-wave</b> superfluid, with spin one, S=1, and angular momentum one, L=1. The ground state corresponds to total angular momentum zero, J=S+L=0 (vector addition).

[...] Using newly implemented telemetric seismographic stations, {{they were able to}} record both <b>P-wave</b> and S-wave arrivals from earthquakes up to 260km beneath the volcanic area. [...] The depths of these earthquakes make this area ideal for studying the structure of the upper mantle. [...] They noted the arrivals of two distinct shear waves with different polarizations (N-S, fast and E-W, slow) approximately 0.7 seconds apart. It was concluded that the splitting was not caused by the earthquake source but by the travel path of the waves {{on the way to the}} seismometers. [...] Data from other nearby stations were used to constrain the source of the seismic anisotropy. [...] He found the anisotropy to be consistent with the area directly below the volcanic area and was hypothesized to occur due to oriented crystals in a deep rooted magma chamber.

Following an earthquake event, S-waves arrive at seismograph stations after the faster-moving <b>P-waves</b> and displace the ground {{perpendicular to the}} direction of propagation. Depending on the propagational direction, the wave can take on different surface characteristics; for example, {{in the case of}} horizontally polarized S waves, the ground moves alternately to one side and then the other. S-waves can travel only through solids, as fluids (liquids and gases) do not support shear stresses.

40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) is {{a common}} cardiac arrhythmia related to irregular atrial contractions. Several {{studies have shown that}} the analysis of <b>P-waves</b> extracted from ECG signals is helpful in understanding the predisposing factors to AF. However, <b>P-waves</b> are usually highly corrupted by noise and harmonic artifacts and this makes quite difficult their analysis. Recently we proposed a novel algorithm for denoising <b>P-waves</b> based on the notion of quadratic variation reduction. It is quite good in denoising <b>P-waves</b> affected by noise, but its effectiveness reduces when it is used in filtering out harmonic artifacts, like power-line interference. In this paper we propose an algorithm that overcomes this limitation and extends our previous method allowing it to both denoise and reject harmonic artifacts.

Based on {{accurately}} located 23 very shallow earthquakes (h = 1 - 14 km) {{in northern}} and central Greece by portable networks of seismic stations {{and by the}} joint epicentre method, the travel times of the <b>P,-waves</b> from the foci of these earthquakes to the sites of 54 permanent stations in the Balkan region have been determined.
