40|$|PURPOSE: The aim was {{to study}} {{selective}} participation {{and its effect on}} prevalence estimates in a health survey of affected residents 3 weeks after a man-made disaster in The Netherlands (May 13, 2000). METHODS: All affected adult residents were invited to <b>participate.</b> <b>Survey</b> (questionnaire) data were combined with electronic medical records of residents' general practitioners (GPs). Data for demographics, relocation, utilization, and morbidity 1 year predisaster and 1 year postdisaster were used. RESULTS: The survey participation rate was 26 % (N = 1171). Women (odds ratio [OR], 1. 46; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 28 - 1. 67), those living with a partner (OR, 2. 00; 95 % CI, 1. 72 - 2. 33), those aged 45 to 64 years (OR, 2. 00; 95 % CI, 1. 59 - 2. 52), and immigrants (OR, 1. 50; 95 % CI, 1. 30 - 1. 74) were more likely to participate. Participation rate was not affected by relocation because of the disaster. Participants in the survey consulted their GPs for health problems in the year before and after the disaster more often than nonparticipants. Although there was selective participation, multiple imputation barely affected prevalence estimates of health problems in the survey 3 weeks postdisaster. CONCLUSIONS: Estimating actual selection bias in disaster studies gives better information about the study representativeness. This is important for policy making and providing effective health care.

40|$|Objectives: This project {{sought to}} compare {{measures}} of organizational climate in ongoing patient safety studies, identify similarities and setting-specific dimensions, develop {{a model of}} climate domains that are hypothesized to affect outcomes across settings, and test aspects of the model. Methods: Investigators who had surveyed health care workers ’ perceptions of organizational climate in six studies funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) were invited to <b>participate.</b> <b>Survey</b> items from each study were classified using four climate domains found in a prior literature review. The authors discussed subconstructs, proposed additional constructs, developed an integrative model, and independently tested selected aspects of the model. Results: The investigators who participated had studied acute care, home health care, long-term care, and multiple settings; two investigators had studied primary care. More than 80, 000 workers were surveyed. The model’s core climate domains included leadership (e. g., values) and organizational structural characteristics (e. g., communication processes and information technology), the impact of which was mediated by four process variables: supervision, group behavior (e. g., collaboration), quality emphasis (e. g., patient centeredness), and work design (e. g., staffing). These factors affect health care worker outcomes (e. g., satisfaction and intention to leave) and patient outcomes. Overall, the full model explained 24 to 65 {{percent of the variance}} in employee satisfaction, but was not as effective at predicting intention to leave. Conclusions: While some of these domains appeared in prior models, new domains—quality emphasis, new subconstructs, information technology, and patient centeredness—are emerging. Our model invites dialogue among researchers and informs agenda-setting for future research into organizational climate and the safety of patients and health care employees. This integrative model will facilitate cross-study quantification of associations among variables in these important domains...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Direct-to-consumer {{genetic testing}} has {{generated}} speculation about how customers will interpret results {{and how these}} interpretations will influence healthcare use and behavior; however, few empirical data on these topics exist. We conducted an online survey of DTC customers of 23 andMe, deCODEme, and Navigenics to begin to address these questions. Random samples of U. S. DTC customers were invited to <b>participate.</b> <b>Survey</b> topics included demo-graphics, perceptions of two sample DTC results, and health behaviors following DTC testing. Of 3, 167 DTC customers invited, 33 % (n 01, 048) completed the survey. Forty-three percent of respondents had sought additional information about a health condition tested; 28 % had discussed their results with a healthcare professional; and 9 % had followed up with additional lab tests. Sixteen percent of respondents had changed a medication or supplement regimen, and one-third said they were being more careful about their diet. Many of these health-related behaviors {{were significantly associated with}} responses to a question that asked how participants would perceive their colon cancer risk (as low, moderate, or high) if they received a test result showing an 11 % lifetime risk, as compared to 5 % risk in the general population. Respondents who would consider themselves to be at high risk for colon cancer {{were significantly more likely to}} have sought information about a disease (p 00. 03), discussed results with a physician (p 00. 05), changed their diet (p 00. 02), and started exercising more (p 00. 01). Participants ’ personal health contexts—including personal and family history of dis-ease and quality of self-perceived health—were also associated with health-related behaviors after testing. Subjective interpre-tations of genetic risk data and personal context appear to be related to health behaviors among DTC customers. Sharing DTC test results with healthcare professionals may add perceived utility to the tests...|$|E

40|$|Health {{professional}} education {{is experiencing a}} cultural shift towards student-centered education. Although we are now challenging our traditional training methods, our methods for evaluating {{the impact of the}} training on the learner remains largely unchanged. What is not typically measured is student-centered value; whether it was 'worth' what the learner paid. The primary aim {{of this study was to}} apply a method of calculating student-centered value, applied to the context of a change in teaching methods within a health professional program. This study took place over the first semester of the third year of the Bachelor of Physiotherapy at Monash University, Victoria, Australia, in 2014. The entire third year cohort (n = 78) was invited to <b>participate.</b> <b>Survey</b> based design was used to collect the appropriate data. A blended learning model was implemented; subsequently students were only required to attend campus three days per week, with the remaining two days comprising online learning. This was compared to the previous year's format, a campus-based face-to-face approach where students attended campus five days per week, with the primary outcome-Value to student. Value to student incorporates, user costs associated with transportation and equipment, the amount of time saved, the price paid and perceived gross benefit. Of the 78 students invited to participate, 76 completed the post-unit survey (non-participation rate 2. 6 %). Based on Value to student the blended learning approach provided a $ 1, 314. 93 net benefit to students. Another significant finding was that the perceived gross benefit for the blended learning approach was $ 4014. 84 compared to the campus-based face-to-face approach of $ 3651. 72, indicating that students would pay more for the blended learning approach. This paper successfully applied a novel method of calculating student-centered value. This is the first step in validating the value to student outcome. Measuring economic value to the student may be used as a way of evaluating effective change in a modern health professional curriculum. This could extend to calculate total value, which would incorporate the economic implications for the educational providers. Further research is required for validation of this outcome...|$|E
40|$|Employing a {{community-based}} participatory research (CBPR) approach, {{this research}} project investigates how patrons {{of a local}} botanical garden establish a connectedness to nature. Collaborating with the Director of Science Education and Research at Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens, the study examined the role of childhood experiences with plants and nature {{in the formation of}} adult participation in nature-based activities using an online anonymous survey. In addition, it examined if nature exposure is associated with perceiving trees and plants as important to physical and psychological health. Participants answered questions about their experiences with plants and nature as a child and as an adult. A link to the survey was sent out via an email from Phipps’ Marketing Department to the roughly 11, 000 Phipps members. In addition, a link to the survey was posted to Phipps’ Facebook and Twitter page. A total of 270 individuals completed the exploratory survey. Analyses of the data show several statistically significant associations between the nature-based activities Phipps patrons report taking part in before the age of 11 and nature-based activities in which they currently <b>participate.</b> <b>Survey</b> respondents who indicated that they often spent time caring for indoor plants and engaging in active garden experiences in childhood where more likely to report greater levels of interactions with nature as an adult. This association is possibly {{explained by the fact that}} active gardening experiences are much more hands-on and create a connection that lasts over the course of an individuals life. Survey data also indicates that for Phipps’ patrons, exposure to nature-based activities before the age of 11 has little influence on perceived physical and psychological health benefits from contact with nature. Respondents who often spend time currently in outdoor places with trees and plants are more likely to perceive health benefits from contact with nature. Contact with nature has great potential as a public health intervention to address physical and psychological health issues at the individual and community level. In addition, research in this area is critical to support funding for environmental education programs at school and botanicals gardens across the country. At the policy level, increasing public awareness of health benefits associated with nature-based activities is also critical to better informing urban development and conservation efforts. Policymakers need to view access to green space and natural areas as a social justice issue...|$|E
40|$|Background: Breastfeeding {{initiation}} in Scotland in 2000 was 63 percent, {{compared with}} over 90 percent in Norway and Sweden. Although peer support {{is effective in}} improving exclusivity of breastfeeding in countries where over 80 percent of women initiate breastfeeding, the evidence for effectiveness in countries with lower initiation is uncertain. Our primary aim was to assess whether group-based and one-to-one peer breastfeeding coaching improves breastfeeding initiation and duration. Methods: Action research methodology was used to conduct an intervention study in 4 geographical postcode areas in rural northeast Scotland. Infant feeding outcomes at birth and hospital discharge; at 1, 2, and 6 weeks; and at 4 and 8 months were collected for 598 of 626 women with live births during a 9 -month baseline period and for 557 of 592 women with live births during a 9 -month intervention period. Groups met in 5 locations, with 266 groups meeting in the period when intervention women were eligible to attend. Data on place of birth and length of postnatal hospital stay were also collected. Control data from 10 other Health Board areas in Scotland were compared. An intention-to <b>participate</b> <b>survey</b> about coaching participation was completed by 206 of 345 women initiating breastfeeding. Group attendance data were collected by means of 266 group diaries. Results: There was {{a significant increase in}} any breastfeeding of 6. 8 percent from 34. 3 to 41. 1 percent (95 % CI 1. 2, 12. 4) in the study population at 2 weeks after birth compared with a decline in any breastfeeding in the rest of Scotland of 0. 4 percent from 44 to 43. 6 percent (95 % CI - 1. 2, 0. 4). Breastfeeding rates increased compared with baseline rates at all time points until 8 months. However, the effect was not uniform across the 4 postcode areas and was not related to level of deprivation. Little difference was seen in receipt of information and knowledge about the availability of coaching among areas. All breastfeeding groups were well attended, popular, and considered helpful by participants. A minority of women (n = 14 / 206) participated in formal one-to-one coaching. Women who received antenatal, birth, and postnatal care from community midwife-led units {{were more likely to be}} breastfeeding at 2 weeks (p = 0. 007) than women who received some or all care in district maternity units. Conclusions: Group-based and one-to-one peer coaching for pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers increased breastfeeding initiation and duration in an area with below average breastfeeding rates...|$|E

This is appropriate for a model form in which the utility expressions associated with the current trip and two attribute packages are unlabelled (or unranked) alternatives. Consequently all design attributes were generic across the three alternatives. In addition, in the current trip alternative we considered alternative-specific characteristics of the passenger (income, gender, age and car availability) and of the operator together with a number of other potential influences on relative utility such as treatment effect, trip purpose and access mode.|$|R
