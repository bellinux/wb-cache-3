40|$|Abstract. Induction of food {{preference}} {{has often}} been observed in herbivorous insects. The term is used to indicate preference of individuals for the host plant they have already experienced over one they have not experienced. A typical set-up is one where individuals first feed on host X or Y, and are then offered a choice between host X and Y. This set-up – and hence the body of empirical data – has been criticised {{for lack of a}} control treatment to untangle the effects of the separate hosts. In this study, we use a design with a third, unrelated host as control to investigate induction of preference in the herbivorous arthropod, Tetranychus urticae. We provide evidence of induced preference, as well as induced performance, and show that there is considerable variation in these two traits among strains. We suggest induced resistance to toxic secondary plant chemicals as one potential explanation for induced performance. This in itself suggests associative learning as the most likely candidate learning mechanism for induction of preference in this species.

40|$|Sleep {{is thought}} to be {{involved}} in the regulation of synaptic plasticity in two ways: by enhancing local <b>plastic</b> processes <b>underlying</b> the consolidation of specific memories and by supporting global synaptic homeostasis. Here, we briefly summarize recent structural and functional studies examining sleep-associated changes in synaptic morphology and neural excitability. These studies point to a global down-scaling of synaptic strength across sleep while a subset of synapses increases in strength. Similarly, neuronal excitability on average decreases across sleep, whereas subsets of neurons increase firing rates across sleep. Whether synapse formation and excitability is down or upregulated across sleep appears to partly depend on the cell’s activity level during wakefulness. Processes of memory-specific upregulation of synapse formation and excitability are observed during slow wave sleep (SWS), whereas global downregulation resulting in elimination of synapses and decreased neural firing is linked to rapid eye movement sleep (REM sleep). Studies of the excitation/inhibition balance in cortical circuits suggest that both processes are connected to a specific inhibitory regulation of cortical principal neurons, characterized by an enhanced perisomatic inhibition via parvalbumin positive (PV+) cells, together with a release from dendritic inhibition by somatostatin positive (SOM+) cells. Such shift towards increased perisomatic inhibition of principal cells appears to be a general motif which <b>underlies</b> the <b>plastic</b> synaptic changes observed during sleep, regardless of whether towards up or downregulation...|$|R
40|$|Ciliates {{are defined}} by the {{presence}} of dimorphic nuclei. Following conjugation, both the functional macronucleus (MAC) and the transcriptionally inactive germline micronucleus (MIC) develop from a zygotic nucleus. As the MAC develops, germline chromosomes are processed by excision of internal sequences, fragmentation and amplification of the remaining chromosomes. The extent of processing varies among lineages and, in all but one class of ciliates, the resulting MACs divide by an unusual process termed ‘amitosis’. Research on these chromosomal rearrangements, largely from studies {{of only a handful of}} taxa from two of the nine classes of ciliates, has failed to find evidence of homologous processing among ciliate lineages. This observation, coupled with the structural diversity of MAC genomes among ciliates, led to the hypothesis of multiple origins of at least two MAC properties: (1) the ability to divide and (2) the mechanisms underlying chromosomal processing. Applying this logic to a more inclusive analysis of ciliate lineages, where an even greater diversity of MAC structure is observed, increases the potential number of origins of these MAC characteristics. Here, it is proposed that a single origin of a relatively <b>plastic</b> mechanism <b>underlying</b> MAC development better explains the observed diversity in MAC structure and processing among ciliates.

In particular, the expression of immediate-early genes (IEGs) such as egr- 1, c-fos, and Arc is rapidly and selectively upregulated in subsets of neurons in specific brain regions associated with learning and memory formation. IEG expression has therefore been widely used as a molecular marker for neuronal populations that undergo <b>plastic</b> changes <b>underlying</b> formation of long-term memory.

To test this hypothesis, we investigated topographic sleep electroencephalographic characteristics, as a measure of brain reorganization, in the acute and chronic stages after hemispheric stroke. We studied eight patients with unilateral stroke in the supply territory of the middle cerebral artery and eight matched controls. All subjects underwent a detailed clinical examination including assessment of stroke severity, sleep habits and disturbances, anxiety and depression, and high-density electroencephalogram examination with 128 electrodes during sleep. The recordings were performed within 10  days after stroke in all patients, and in six patients also 3  months later. During sleep, we found higher slow-wave and theta activity over the affected hemisphere in the infarct area in the acute and chronic stage of stroke. Slow-wave, theta activity and spindle frequency range power over the affected hemisphere were lower in comparison to the non-affected side in a peri-infarct area in the patients' group, which persisted over time. Conversely, in wakefulness, only an increase of delta, theta activity and a slowing of alpha activity over the infarct area were found. Sleep slow-wave activity correlated with stroke severity and outcome. Stroke might have differential effects on the generation of delta activity in wakefulness and sleep slow waves (1 - 8  Hz).

Temporary inactivation of the ventral, but not dorsal hippocampus (VH, DH, respectively) using muscimol disrupted the acquisition of CD, whereas pretraining VH infusions of anisomycin, a protein synthesis inhibitor, failed to block CD. To test for a functional connection between the VH and basolateral amygdala (BLA), we used a classic functional connectivity design wherein injections are made unilaterally in brain areas either on the same or opposite sides of the brain. A functional connection between the BLA and VH necessary for the acquisition of CD could not be found because unilateral inactivation of either BLA alone (but not either VH alone) was sufficient to disrupt CD. This finding suggested instead {{that there may be a}} critical functional connection between the left and right BLA. In our final experiment, we infused muscimol unilaterally in the BLA and assessed Fos immunoreactivity on the contralateral side following exposure to social defeat.

Both gria 2 KO and wild-type (WT) mice learned to associate a light/tone stimulus with food delivery, as evidenced by approach toward the food magazine after {{the presentation of the}} cues (pavlovian conditioning). Subsequently, the cues also served to reinforce an operant response in both KO and WT mice (conditioned reinforcement), although response rates were greater in gria 2 KOs. Responding for conditioned reinforcement was enhanced after 0. 5 mg/kg amphetamine administration in WT mice, but not in KO mice. The ability of the cues to elicit approach behavior (conditioned approach) and to enhance responding for the reward (pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer; PIT) were also impaired in gria 2 KO mice. This pattern of behavior resembles that seen after lesions of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), an area rich in GluR 2 -containing AMPA receptors. Immunostaining revealed reduced GluR 1 expression within both the basolateral amygdala and the CeA, suggesting that the behavioral deficits observed were unlikely to be caused by compensatory changes in GluR 1.

40|$|Purpose: We {{describe}} {{the use of}} a clinically relevant pharmacological intervention that alters the clinical history of status epilepticus (SE) -induced spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) in the pilocarpine model and the possible <b>plastic</b> changes <b>underlying</b> such an effect. Methods: Two hours after pilocarpine-induced SE (320 - 350 mg/kg, i. p.), rats received scopolamine 1 - 2 mg/kg i. p. or saline, every 6 h for 3 days. After that, osmotic minipumps were implanted for continuous delivery of scopolainine or saline for an additional 14 days. Animals were video-monitored for 12 h/week during the following 3 -month period for the occurrence of SRS and, thereafter, were perfused, processed, and coronal brain sections were stained for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and for the presence of supragranular mossy fibers (Timm),Results: Treatment with scopolamine led to significantly fewer SRS. Staining for AChE in the dentate gyrus was significantly more intense in naive animals. the scopolamine group had the least intense AChE staining of all groups. However, regression analysis of the AChE staining for this group did not correlate with {{the presence or absence of}} SRS, or the latency or frequency of SRS. Supragranular mossy fiber sprouting developed in all animals experiencing pilocarpine-induced SE, irrespective of whether or not they were treated with scopolamine. Conclusions: Pilocarpine-induced SE in the presence of scopolamine might produce animals that, despite mossy fiber sprouting, were not seen to exhibit spontaneous seizures. in addition, our data suggest that the encountered changes in the AChE staining in the dentate gyrus that followed treatment with scopolamine do not help to explain its disease-modifying effects.

In addition, the amygdala and the hippocampus are well-known brain areas for learning and memory, however a recent study has shown that the posterior hypothalamus may also be a critical site for simple forms of learning like habituation. Building on this research, this project seeks to determine if microtubule associated protein kinases 1 / 2 (ERK) and calcium-dependent calmodulin kinase II alpha (CaMKIIα) are in cells characterized as active by stress-induced c-Fos protein expression in the posterior hypothalamic (PH) nucleus. In the following series of studies, we demonstrate with immunohistochemistry that ERK and CaMKIIα, but not Elk- 1 can be localized in stress-responsive neurons of the posterior hypothalamus. Immunohistochemistry was used to measure the functional activation of ERK by assessing its level of phosphorylation (pERK) and the presence of CaMKII, in the posterior hypothalamus of acutely stressed rats. The phosphorylation of ERK is time-dependent; whereas basal expression was observed in control animals, a significant increase was observed in rats exposed to 15 - 30 minutes of stress. It has been shown that Fos protein is expressed in active pathways in the brain and we found that pERK but not CaMKII is significantly co-expressed in the same cells with Fos. These findings suggest that ERK is present in neurons that are likely signaling during stressful exposures, and could be involved in long-term <b>plastic</b> changes <b>underlying,</b> for example, habituation to repeated stress...|$|R

However, {{in this report}} we show that Joule heating is a unique and serious problem with these electrodes. When conducting current densities encountered in organic solar cells, the average surface temperature of indium tin oxide (ITO) and silver nanowire electrodes, both with sheet resistances of 60 ohms/square, remains below 35 °C. However, in contrast to ITO, {{the temperature in the}} nanowire electrode is very non-uniform, with some localized points reaching temperatures above 250 °C. These hotspots accelerate nanowire degradation, leading to electrode failure after 5 days of continuous current flow. We show that graphene, a commonly used passivation layer for these electrodes, slows nanowire degradation and creates a more uniform surface temperature under current flow. However, the graphene does not prevent Joule heating in the nanowires and local points of high temperature ultimately shift the failure mechanism from nanowire degradation to melting of the <b>underlying</b> <b>plastic</b> substrate. In this paper, surface temperature mapping, lifetime testing under current flow, post-mortem analysis, and modelling illuminate the behaviour and failure mechanisms of nanowires under extended current flow and provide guidelines for managing Joule heating...|$|R
