5|$|In {{the months}} {{immediately}} following the 1930 renumbering, NY14 was routed on <b>Pennsylvania</b> <b>Avenue</b> and South Main Street through southern Elmira. By 1935, NY14 was rerouted to follow <b>Pennsylvania</b> <b>Avenue</b> into downtown. As a result, all of NY17D north of the junction of Pennsylvania and Maple avenues became concurrent with NY14. The overlap was eliminated in the early 1940s when NY17D was pulled back to the intersection of Pennsylvania and Maple avenues and renumbered as NY427.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the most}} legendary music venues in Baltimore have been shut down, {{including}} most of the shops, churches, bars and other destinations on the legendary <b>Pennsylvania</b> <b>Avenue,</b> center for the city's jazz scene. The Royal Theater, {{once one of the}} premiere destinations for African American performers on the East Coast, is marked only by a simple plaque, the theater itself having been demolished in 1971. A statue of Billie Holiday remains on <b>Pennsylvania</b> <b>Avenue,</b> however, between Lafayette and Lanvale, with a plaque that reads I don't think I'm singing. I feel like I am playing a horn.

5|$|Continuing eastward, I-496 passes {{north of}} the {{assembly}} plant complex {{and south of the}} central business district. East of a partial interchange with Walnut Street, the freeway passes the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame, which is located on I-496's southern service drive. The south side of the freeway is adjacent to Cooley Gardens near the confluence of the Grand and Red Cedar rivers. I-496 crosses the Grand River downstream from the confluence and meets the eastern terminus of the Capitol Loop. This interchange with Cedar and Larch streets is also a connection to Business Loop I-96 (BL I-96) and <b>Pennsylvania</b> <b>Avenue.</b> St. Joseph Street ends after the connection to <b>Pennsylvania</b> <b>Avenue.</b> The main freeway crosses a rail line owned by CSX Transportation. I-496 runs parallel to {{the north side of the}} rail line while Malcolm X Street follows to the south as far as the Clemens Avenue overpass.

5|$|<b>Pennsylvania</b> <b>Avenue</b> (often known {{simply as}} The Avenue) and Fremont Avenue were the major scenes for Baltimore's black musicians from the 1920s to the 1950s, and was an early home for Eubie Blake and Noble Sissle, among others. Baltimore had long been a major stop on the black touring circuit, and jazz musicians {{frequently}} played on <b>Pennsylvania</b> <b>Avenue</b> {{on the way to}} or from engagements in New York. <b>Pennsylvania</b> <b>Avenue</b> attracted African Americans {{from as far away as}} North Carolina, and was known for its vibrant entertainment and nightlife, as well as a more seedy side, home to prostitution, violence, ragtime and jazz, which were perceived as unsavory. The single most important venue for outside acts was the Royal Theatre, which was one of the finest African American theaters in the country when it was opened as the Douglass Theater, and was part of the popular performing circuit that included the Earle in Philadelphia, the Howard in Washington, D.C., the Regal in Chicago and the Apollo Theater in New York; like the Apollo, the audience at the Royal Theater was known for cruelly receiving those performers who didn't live up to their standards. Music venues were segregated, though not without resistance - a 1910 tour featuring Bert Williams resulted in an African American boycott of a segregated theater, hoping the threat of lost business from the popular show would cause a change in policy. <b>Pennsylvania</b> <b>Avenue</b> was also a center for black cultural and economic life in Baltimore, and was home to numerous schools, theaters, churches and other landmarks. The street's nightclubs and other entertainment venues were most significant however, including the Penn Hotel, the first African American-owned hotel in Baltimore (built in 1921). Even the local bars and other establishments that didn't feature live music as a major feature generally had a solo pianist or organist. The first local bar to specialize in jazz was Club Tijuana. Major music venues at this time included Ike Dixon's Comedy Club, Skateland, Gamby's, Wendall's Tavern, The New Albert Dreamland, the Ritz, and most importantly, the Sphinx Club. The Sphinx Club became one of the first minority-owned nightclubs in the United States when it opened in 1946, founded by Charles Phillip Tilghman, a local businessman.|$|E

Harrison installed a private lobby entrance leading to a private elevator to the 10th and 11th floors. The railroad took occupancy of the building in the middle of 1929.|$|E
5|$|The inaugural parade route {{ran along}} Pennsylvania Avenue,N.W. from the U.S.Capitol, ending {{at the north}} face of the White House. During most of the parade, President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama {{traveled}} in the new armored limousine because of potential security threats. The President and First Lady twice exited their limousine, walking on <b>Pennsylvania</b> <b>Avenue</b> for portions of the parade. Vice President Biden and his wife Jill walked the parade route at several points with their children Beau, Hunter and Ashley.|$|E
5|$|The route passes more {{businesses}} and heads toward Suitland, where it intersects MD 414 (Bonita Street) again. The road continues north to an intersection with MD 637 (Naylor Road). North of Naylor Road, the route passes under the Green Line of the Washington Metro, interchanges with the Suitland Parkway, and narrows to a 2-lane undivided road in quick succession. MD 5 passes through wooded areas {{before coming to}} an intersection with Southern Avenue at the Washington, D.C. border where the route ends and Branch Avenue continues into the District of Columbia toward <b>Pennsylvania</b> <b>Avenue.</b>|$|E
50|$|Each color group, {{referred}} to as a monopoly, had to be controlled by one of the players before play moved on to another. Once a player controlled a monopoly, the total monetary value of its properties was added to his/her score. The lowest monopoly value was $120, which was for Mediterranean and Baltic Avenues. The highest was $920, for the three-property monopoly consisting of Pacific, North Carolina, and <b>Pennsylvania</b> <b>Avenues.</b>|$|R

5|$|I-35E was {{completed}} {{north of downtown}} Saint Paul in 1970. The first section to open ran north from Maryland Avenue in Saint Paul to I-694 in Little Canada; this {{was completed}} in the early 1960s, concurrently with I-694 west to old MN49 (Rice Street). Later that decade, I-35E was extended south to downtown Saint Paul, opening first to <b>Pennsylvania</b> <b>Avenue</b> and then to I-94, including the I-35E / I-94 concurrency (and I-94 in both directions). In 1970, I-35E was extended north along the I-35E / I-694 concurrency in Little Canada– Vadnais Heights and also extended northbound to its northern terminus at Columbus near Forest Lake; the adjacent sections of I-35, I-35W, and I-694 opened {{at about the same}} time.|$|E
5|$|MD 5 was {{designated}} in 1927 {{to the state}} highway between north of Point Lookout and the Washington, D.C. border, passing through Leonardtown, Hughesville, and Waldorf. MD 5 ran concurrent with MD 3 (now US 301) between Waldorf and TB. In 1928, the route was paved between north of TB and Camp Springs. By 1933, MD 5 was paved between northwest of Leonardtown and north of Morganza and along the MD 3 concurrency between Waldorf and the Charles-Prince George's county border. Also, the route was extended south along an unpaved road into Point Lookout State Park. In 1939, MD 5 was rerouted to follow Naylor Road to the Washington, D.C. border while the portion of Branch Avenue leading to the border {{was designated}} as MD 637. DC 5 continued into Washington, D.C. along Naylor Road, Good Hope Road, and 11th Street SE to DC 4 (<b>Pennsylvania</b> <b>Avenue</b> SE). By this time, the section of route between Hughesville and Waldorf was paved while the section between Point Lookout and Leonardtown was a bituminous road. By 1946, MD 5 was paved between Great Mills and Leonardtown. Also, DC 5 was extended to follow DC 4 along <b>Pennsylvania</b> <b>Avenue</b> to US 1 and US 240 at {{the east side of}} the White House. In 1949, the DC 5 designation was decommissioned.|$|E
5000|$|... 1.3 {{million people}} {{reportedly}} stood on Constitution and <b>Pennsylvania</b> <b>Avenues</b> in Washington, D.C., {{to watch the}} inaugural parade.

5|$|Most {{of what is}} now NY427 was {{originally}} designated as NY17D in the 1930 renumbering. NY17D began at the intersection of East Water Street (NY17) and Madison Avenue (NY14 and NY17) in downtown Elmira. NY17D headed west, overlapping NY14 along Water Street to Lake Street, where NY17D turned south and followed Lake Street and <b>Pennsylvania</b> <b>Avenue</b> over the Chemung River to Maple Avenue. Here, NY17D turned to the southeast to follow Maple Avenue through southern Elmira. At Cedar Street, NY17D joined the modern alignment of NY427. From this point east, NY17D followed what is now NY427 to Wyncoop Creek Road in Chemung, where it continued on Wilawana Road to the Pennsylvania border.|$|E
5|$|The City of Washington was {{bordered by}} Boundary Street {{to the north}} (renamed Florida Avenue in 1890), Rock Creek to the west, and the Anacostia River to the east. Washington's street grid was extended, where possible, {{throughout}} the District starting in 1888. Georgetown's streets were renamed in 1895. Some streets are particularly noteworthy, such as <b>Pennsylvania</b> <b>Avenue,</b> which connects the White House to the Capitol and K Street, which houses the offices of many lobbying groups. Washington hosts 177 foreign embassies, constituting approximately 297 buildings beyond the more than 1,600 residential properties owned by foreign countries, {{many of which are}} on a section of Massachusetts Avenue informally known as Embassy Row.|$|E
5|$|A {{deal for}} the sale of Constitution Center was agreed to in December 2012. MetLife and an {{unidentified}} investor (represented by Clarion Partners LLC) each purchased a 50 percent interest in the building. The sale price was $734 million, or $524 per square foot (0.093 square meters). The sale price was the most expensive in D.C. history for a single building. (It was not the most paid per square foot, however. That record went to two-building Market Square at 701 and 801 <b>Pennsylvania</b> <b>Avenue</b> NW, which sold in 2011 to Wells Real Estate Investment Trust for $905 per square foot.) When the deal closed in February 2013, David Nassif Associates announces it would wind down its operations and liquidate its remaining obligations.|$|E
5000|$|A city {{particularly}} {{known for}} its terminating vistas is Paris, {{where many of the}} largest streets end in monuments and structures such as the Arc de Triomphe, Palais Garnier or the Panthéon. Another well-known example is Washington, D.C., where, most notably, the United States Capitol provides the terminating vista for North, South, and East Capitol Streets, as well as the National Mall and either side of Delaware, New Jersey, Maryland, and <b>Pennsylvania</b> <b>Avenues</b> (which are all bisected by the Capitol, turning into pedestrian walkways around the edifice).|$|R
5000|$|In the mid-20th century, Upton's {{population}} swelled due to {{the popularity}} of the neighborhood and the pressures of state racial segregation that kept African Americans confined to certain areas in the city.
