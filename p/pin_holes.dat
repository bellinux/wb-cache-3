25|$|Hertzfeldt's work {{commonly}} features hand-drawn stick figures, {{in stories}} of black humor, surrealism, and tragicomedy. Some films contain existential and philosophical themes {{while others are}} more straightforwardly slapstick and absurdist. His animation is created traditionally with pen and paper, often with minimal digital aid. Hertzfeldt uses antique 16mm or 35mm–film cameras to photograph his drawings and often employs old-fashioned special effect techniques such as multiple exposures, in-camera mattes, and experimental photography. While some of these techniques are as established as an occasional stop-motion animation sequence or a universe of moving stars created by back-lit <b>pin</b> <b>holes,</b> other effects are new innovations on classical methods, as seen with the in-camera compositing of multiple, split-screen windows of action in the Everything Will Be OK films.|$|E

When the system is evacuated the high voltage electrode of the coil is played over the outside of the apparatus.

[...] Therefore, the discharge travels through any pin hole immediately below it, producing a corona discharge inside the evacuated space which illuminates the hole, indicating points that need to be annealed or reblown before they can be used in an experiment.|$|E

40|$|Gas {{turbines}} casings {{are susceptible}} to cracking {{at the edge of}} eccentric <b>pin</b> <b>hole,</b> which is the most likely position for crack initiation and propagation. This paper describes the improvement of transient thermal fatigue crack propagation life of gas turbines casings through the application of additional holes. The crack position and direction was determined using non-destructive tests. A series of finite element patterns were developed and tested in ASTM-A 395 elastic perfectly-plastic ductile cast iron. The effect of arrangement of additional holes on transient thermal fatigue behavior of gas turbines casings containing hole edge cracks was investigated. ABAQUS finite element package and Zencrack fracture mechanics code were used for modeling. The effect of the reduction of transient thermal stress distribution around the eccentric <b>pin</b> <b>hole</b> on the transient thermal fatigue crack propagation life of the gas turbines casings was discussed. The result shows that transient thermal fatigue crack propagation life could be extended by applying additional holes of larger diameter and decreased by increasing the vertical distance, angle, and distance between the eccentric <b>pin</b> <b>hole</b> and the additional holes. The results from the numerical predictions were compared with experimental data...|$|R

Forty maxillary incisors were prepared at their palatinal surfaces 0. 3 mm thick, and were divided into four treatments (threaded hole+threaded pin, threaded holes+ non-threaded pin, non-threaded holes+threaded pin, non-threaded holes+non-threaded pin). Casted-plates made from nickel chromium alloy were cemented to the palatal surface of the tooth with adhesive cement (Panavia TMF 2. 0), and then adhesion shear strength tested. The test and evaluation of the residual cement on the surface were performed in Laboratory Metallurgy, Department of Engineering ITB. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA test (p= 0. 05). Adhesion shear strength of plate with threaded holes+threaded pin has the highest retention. Residual cement on threaded hole+threaded pin plates similar to threaded hole+non-threaded pin, but more than any other groups. the conclusions were, the adhesion shear strength depends on the design of <b>pin</b> <b>hole.</b> The wider surface of cement remaining on the plates, the greater adhesion shear strength...|$|R
