5|$|Little Fishing Creek {{serves as}} a water supply source for nearby {{communities}} such as Millville. Slate has been quarried on the creek and limestone has also been produced there.

The Susquehanna, Bloomsburg, and Berwick Railroad historically crossed the watershed and followed the creek between its mouth and Millville.|$|E

5|$|Education of {{the young}} was never {{considered}} to be the primary domain of schools, even after they had become more common. Most education was carried out by a child's parents or foster parents. Formal apprenticeships were not the norm in Plymouth; it was expected that a foster family would teach the children whatever trades they themselves <b>practiced.</b> <b>The</b> church also {{played a central role in}} a child's education. As noted above, the primary purpose of teaching children to read was so that they could read the Bible for themselves.|$|E
5|$|Boxing was {{introduced}} and practiced in a clandestine manner in Puerto Rico while the archipelago {{was still a}} Spanish colony. Fights were organized in haciendas among the workers of the sugar and coffee plantations, and the objective {{was to determine the}} best fighter among the employees. Following the culmination of the Puerto Rican Campaign and Spanish–American War, American soldiers who were stationed in the main island <b>practiced</b> <b>the</b> sport. During World War I, a championship known as Campeonato Las Casas was held as training for military personnel. Nero Chen, the first Puerto Rican boxer to gain recognition, began his career in these tournaments. The Combat Maneuver Training Center followed this example and organized boxing activities, which they named Los Campeones del Campamento. These were received with enthusiasm by the young recruits. Most of these events were celebrated without restriction due to military jurisdictional limits, although prohibitions were put in place for the civilian population. Illegal matches were organized on the rooftops of residences in Old San Juan, empty terrain's in El Condado and in hippodromes.|$|E

5|$|Han {{farmers in}} the Yangzi River region of {{southern}} China often maintained paddy fields for growing rice. Every year, they would burn the weeds in the paddy field, drench it in water, sow rice by hand, and around harvest time cut the surviving weeds and drown them a second time. In this system, the field lays fallow {{for much of the}} year and thus did not remain very fertile. However, Han rice farmers to the north around the Huai River <b>practiced</b> <b>the</b> more advanced system of transplantation. In this system, individual plants were given intensive care (perhaps in the same location as the paddy field), their offshoots separated so that more water could be conserved, and the field could be heavily fertilized since winter crops were grown while the rice seedlings were situated nearby in a plant nursery.|$|E
5|$|Little {{thought was}} given to the Chinese {{reaction}} to the Open Door note; the Chinese minister in Washington, Wu Ting-fang, did not learn of it until he read of it in the newspapers. Among those in China who opposed Western influence there was a movement in Shantung Province, in the north, that became known as the Fists of Righteous Harmony, or Boxers, after the martial arts they <b>practiced.</b> <b>The</b> Boxers were especially angered by missionaries and their converts. As late as June 1900, Rockhill dismissed the Boxers, contending that they would soon disband. By the middle of that month, the Boxers, joined by imperial troops, had cut the railroad between Peking and the coast, killed many missionaries and converts, and besieged the foreign legations. Hay faced a precarious situation; how to rescue the Americans trapped in Peking, and how to avoid giving the other powers an excuse to partition China, in an election year when there was already Democrat opposition to what they deemed American imperialism.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of {{the causes}} of the Breeders' hiatus, by early 1995 Deal {{believed}} her next album would be a solo one, and at first intended to play all instruments on it herself. Back at her home in Dayton, Ohio, she <b>practiced</b> <b>the</b> drums and initially prepared six songs for recording. Around the same time, she produced some tracks for Guided by Voices at Easley Studios in Memphis, Tennessee. While there, Deal used a portion of the studio time to record demos for some of her new songs. As an attempt to distract her sister from her drug problems, Deal recruited Kelley to play on three songs at this initial recording session. Kelley's involvement changed Deal's mind about playing all the instruments herself, and she began to conceptualize the album as a band project.|$|E

5|$|Spanish {{control of}} Texas was {{followed}} by Mexican control of Texas, {{and it can be}} difficult to separate the Spanish and Mexican influences on the future state. The most obvious legacy is that of the language; the state's name comes from the Spanish rendering of an Indian word. Every major river in modern Texas, except the Red River, has a Spanish or Anglicized name, as do 42 of the state's 254 counties and numerous towns also bear Spanish names. Even many of the words that have been incorporated into American English, such as barbecue, canyon, ranch, and plaza, come from Spanish words. An additional obvious legacy is that of Roman Catholicism. At the end of Spain's reign over Texas, virtually all inhabitants <b>practiced</b> <b>the</b> Catholic religion, and it is still practiced in Texas by a large number of people. The Spanish missions built in San Antonio to convert Indians to Catholicism have been restored and are a National Historic Landmark.|$|E
5|$|As {{the date}} of the {{operation}} approached, training became more intensive. Glider units spent hours aloft every day circling over airfields as they <b>practiced</b> <b>the</b> manoeuvers required to land the airborne forces next to the bridges over the Orne River, the Caen canal, the Dives, and the Merville battery. Once the pilots had practiced this sufficiently during the day, they were then switched to night operations. In the landing grounds used by the division for their operations, dozens of poles similar to those in Normandy were erected, with engineering units then timed on how fast they could demolish the obstacles. The battalion assigned to neutralising Merville spent two weeks at a special camp, where they built a replica of the battery and carried out several rehearsal exercises in and around it. The force assigned to the coup-de-main operation, to capture the bridges over the Orne River and Caen canal, were transferred to Exeter. There, they conducted intensive exercises around the River Exe and the nearby canal that stood in place for their real objective. The pilots of the gliders and transport aircraft were also constantly briefed with thousands of maps and photographs of the landing zones and the surrounding areas, as well as dozens of scale models of the zones and the primary objectives, such as the bridges and the Merville battery. A coloured film was produced from aerial reconnaissance photographs which, when played at the correct speed and height over the scale models, realistically simulated the paths the glider pilots would take towards their landing-zones.|$|E
