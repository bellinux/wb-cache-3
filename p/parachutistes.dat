Kamanyola Division units collapsed almost immediately. French units fought the Battle of Kolwezi to recapture the town from the FLNC. The U.S. provided logistical assistance.|$|E

25|$|Major General Sourith Don Sasorith was of Vietnamese-Lao heritage. He owed his {{appointment}} {{as a military}} officer to family connections; Katay Don Sasorith, his cousin, was the former Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Laos. Sourith commanded Bataillon <b>Parachutistes</b> 1 (Battalion of Parachutists 1) and Bataillon <b>Parachutistes</b> 2 (Battalion of Parachutists 2) of the Royal Lao Army. He also took command of the Lao Army Air Force in January 1958. Despite its name, it consisted of only a single composite squadron of mixed types of aircraft. A French major had been in charge; however, the language barrier between French and Lao had hindered training, as had the low educational level of the Lao airmen. Sourith was appointed because he was strict on discipline. His aviation command was additional {{to that of the}} paratroopers. At the time, there was one Lao pilot trained, but 36 more still in training; Sourith was not one of them.|$|E

25|$|Deuane {{continued}} {{to serve in}} the Lao military after the French defeat, becoming a company commander in Bataillion <b>Parachutistes</b> 2 (Parachute Battalion 2) under Captain Kong Le. When Kong Le revolted against what he perceived as a corrupt government in August 1960, Deuane sat out the coup. However, afterward he attached himself to Kong Le as the captain tried to rally the nation {{to the side of the}} coup forces.|$|E
25|$|On 15 September 1940, Free French Captain Georges Bergé {{created the}} {{airborne}} unit called 1re compagnie de l'air, 1re CIA (1st Air Company) in Great Britain. This unit later known as 1re compagnie de chasseurs <b>parachutistes,</b> 1re CCP (1st Parachute Light Infantry Company) joined the July 1941-created British Special Air Service airborne unit at David Stirling's demand to Charles de Gaulle in 1942 {{to become the}} SAS Brigade's French Squadron.|$|E
25|$|After Lee Lue's funeral, the Hmong guerrillas withdrew to Long Tieng. The Royalist 101 Bataillon de <b>Parachutistes</b> were helilifted to a {{defensive}} position at Ban Na. On 10 August 1969, PAVN troops overran Xieng Dat, scattering the Neutralists. After {{the remnants of}} the Neutralist unit were regathered at Muong Kassy, they were airlifted to Thailand for retraining. The communists still controlled the Plain of Jars. They had escalated their offensive power with tanks; to that they added seven fresh infantry battalions.|$|E

25|$|The 55 Bataillon <b>Parachutistes</b> (55th Paratroop Battalion) {{was sent}} to the rescue. Its first attempt at a combat drop at Ban saw half of the {{battalion}} being blown off course over a ridge adjacent to the drop zone. After a second drop the following morning, the two paratroop battalions bypassed Khamkeut to relieve the garrison still holding their ground at Lak Sao. A confused withdrawal down Route 8 followed. Another reinforcing battalion, Bataillon Volontaires 34 (Volunteer Battalion 34) was also inserted into Khamkeut.|$|E
25|$|Reinforcements for Luang Prabang were {{rushed in}} from the other Military Regions. Bataillon <b>Parachutistes</b> 101 was {{immediately}} diverted from a pending offensive on the Bolovens Plateau in Military Region 4 (MR 4). Military Region 5 (MR 5) forwarded Bataillon Commando 205 from Vientiane. Both battalions were forwarded to a position 14 kilometers northeast of the capital, at the juncture of the Nam Soung and Mekong Rivers. On 22 March, the communists drove the Royalist infantry from their position on the King's farm and took it over.|$|E
25|$|Building on success, on 20 August Vang Pao {{expanded}} his offensive. He continued to plan on a two-pronged operation. As before, {{there was a}} northern column. Two battalions of Royalist regular volunteers—Bataillon Volontaires 21 and Bataillon Volontaires 24—were stiffened with the 101 Bataillon <b>Parachutistes</b> (101st Paratroop Battalion). This probe moved northeastward from Ban Na; their immediate objective was Moung Phanh. The second column, moving in from the south, consisted of two regimental-size units of guerrillas, Groupe Mobile 22 and Groupe Mobile 23. Most of the Kou Kiet troops were armed with M16s.|$|E

25|$|In early December, PS 22 was {{reinforced}} with two additional battalions of Royalist regulars, Bataillon Infanterie 7 (Battalion of Infantry 7, or BI 7) and Bataillon Infanterie 25 (Battalion of Infantry 25, or BI 25). After a few days, BI 7, BI 25, and {{over half the}} guerrillas deserted the position. By hastily importing 102 Bataillon <b>Parachutistes</b> (102nd Battalion of Parachutists, or 102 BP) from Military Region 3, PS 22 was held against communist attacks during the first fortnight of December. The CIA assigned two case agents in a Pilatus Porter to overfly and encourage 102 BP. U.S. Air Force AC-119 gunships flew cover over PS 22. The Royalist position held.|$|E
25|$|On 29 July 1959, under {{command of}} General Amkha Soukhavong, Captain Kong Le led Bataillon <b>Parachutistes</b> 2 (Parachute Battalion 2) to {{reinforce}} other Royalist troops engaged with the Pathet Lao communists in armed disputes over Royalist outposts in Xam Neua Province. Accompanied by two Filipino advisers, the battalion patrolled {{for three days}} without contact with any enemy. When the captain drove to Xam Neua City to report to General Amkha, he was outraged to find the city had been abandoned by the general, {{as well as by}} its military and civil administration. Kong Le was further disgruntled by the RLA's failure to pay his men while they were on the combat sweep.|$|E
25|$|Although Phoumi and the RLG {{were heavily}} {{dependent}} on American military and logistical support, he did not pay heed to the American embassy's disapproval. The Americans judged the operation to be conducted {{too close to the}} Vietnamese border, and thus inviting retaliation from the PAVN. Nevertheless, the Laotians decided to go ahead anyway; General Sang Kittarath was placed in charge of the RLA/FAN task force. He committed the Neutralist Bataillon Infanterie 8 (Infantry Battalion 8), 5 Bataillon <b>Parachutistes</b> (5th Paratroop Battalion), and a Neutralist light tank company of PT-76s to the assault. By the end of November, the Royalist task force had occupied Lak Sao. At about the same time, Bataillon Regional 350 (Regional Battalion 350) occupied a westerly flanking position at Khamkeut.|$|E

25|$|On 19 July, the {{offensive}} kicked off under command of General Kouprasith Abhay. Group Mobile 11 (Mobile Group 11) traipsed south on Route 13 from Luang Prabang. Pushing against little opposition, they captured a 105mm howitzer, an 81mm mortar, and nine Pathet Lao soldiers. Meanwhile, Group Mobile 17 (Mobile Group 17) accompanied FAN forces northward toward the junction. Also on the 19th, GM 16 pushed westwards, screened by about 1,200 rounds of Thai artillery fire and 32 bombing sorties by RLAF T-28s. GM 16 covered {{a third of}} the distance from Muang Soui to their objective in just two days. Simultaneously, following heavy T-28 strikes, the Neutralist Bataillon <b>Parachutistes</b> 2 (Paratroop Battalion 2) from Muang Soui began its attacks on Phou Kout.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} of the coup, the Patriotic Neutralists had been largely absorbed into the Pathet Lao; the two sides held the first of their {{biannual}} cooperative political congresses in 1964. On the Plain of Jars, the coup sparked further dissension in the Neutralist movement. Two of FAN's paratroop battalions—BP 4 and BP 6—favored siding with the communists. On 27 April 1964, as the Royalist garrison withdrew from Phou San, it was attacked and defeated by communist forces as nearby FAN units deigned to intervene. However, when Pathet Lao occupied the vacated strongpoint overlooking Kong Le's headquarters at Muong Phan, his Bataillon <b>Parachutistes</b> 5 unsuccessfully assaulted the mountaintop. Six days later, the third mountaintop position, on Phou Nong, also fell. The defeated troops split into two columns escaping in opposite directions, with the Royalists retreating southeast while FAN withdrew to the northwest.|$|E
25|$|Elements of Kong Le's Bataillon <b>Parachutistes</b> 2 had chased pro-Phoumi {{forces from}} Paksan on 22 September and still {{occupied}} it. Faced {{with a new}} threat to this bastion, Kong Le rushed additional troops from Vientiane some 150 kilometers to Paksan to reinforce it against the arrival of Phoumi's troops. Some residual anti-Kong Le forces led by Colonel Kouprasith Abhay emerged in the power vacuum this left, bidding {{for control of the}} capital, and the parachutist reinforcements had to be returned to the capital. As a result, Phoumi's assault element suffered no serious opposition, and rolled into Paksan. At the same time, the BP 1 paratroopers who were on Phoumi's side were airdropped on the Royal Lao Army headquarters at Chinimao, on the verge of the capital. Suspicious of Kouprasith's ambitions, Phoumi appointed Brigadier General Bounleut Sanichanh as commander-in-chief of the counter-coup forces.|$|E

25|$|When the Pathet Lao forced FAN {{to retreat}} on 6 April 1963, Deuane split the Forces Armee Neutraliste {{movement}} by splintering off a pro-communist faction, the Patriotic Neutralists. At a conference mediated by former Souvanna Phouma allies Khamsouk Keoka and Heuan Mongkholvilay the three battalions of neutralists under Brigadier General Khamouane Boupha in Military Region 1's far northern Phongsali Province opted to join him. So did Battalion <b>Parachutistes</b> 1 (Parachute Battalion 1) and the Phetsarath Artillery Battalion in MR 2. By November 1963, {{nearly all of}} Battalion Infanterie 4 (Infantry Battalion 4) in Xepon in the Laotian southern panhandle swung over to the new Neutralist organization. Laotian Route 9 from Khe Sanh to Xepon was open to the communists. The Patriotic Neutralists would ally themselves with the communists, and serve to occupy localities that had been communist held {{at the time of}} the 1962 International Agreement on the Neutrality of Laos. Colonel Deuane would maintain a low profile into the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|In April 1963, the Neutralists split. Colonel Deuane founded his own Patriotic Neutralists from units abandoning FAN. Deuane {{had about}} 250 troops under his command; they allied {{themselves}} with General Khamouane Boupha's force of 1,500 in far northern Phongsali Province. The Phetsarath Artillery Battalion, which had downed the Air America plane, {{was one of}} the units that joined Deuane. Batallion <b>Parachutistes</b> 1 (Paratroop Battalion 1) was another, along with all of Khamouane's Neutralist Forces from Military Region 1. In the southern panhandle, the majority of Batallion Infanterie 4 (Battalion of Infantry 4) near Tchepone defected to the new movement, which allied itself with the Pathet Lao communists. On 6 April 1963, the Pathet Lao launched several simultaneous surprise attacks on the Neutralists on the Plain of Jars. On 10 April 1963, U.S. President John F. Kennedy approved U.S. military aid supply drops to bolster FAN. Although FAN was driven from its positions, it evacuated most of its vehicles and crew-served weapons to Muong Phanh.|$|E
