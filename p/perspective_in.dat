5|$|Art has {{sometimes}} stimulated {{the development of}} mathematics, as when Brunelleschi's theory of <b>perspective</b> <b>in</b> architecture and painting started a cycle of research {{that led to the}} work of Brook Taylor and Johann Heinrich Lambert on the mathematical foundations of perspective drawing, and ultimately to the mathematics of projective geometry of Girard Desargues and Jean-Victor Poncelet.|$|E
5|$|Concept {{work began}} {{during the middle}} of {{production}} on the Persona 2 duology. Featuring staff from the Megami Tensei franchise including artist Kazuma Kaneko and composer Shoji Meguro, development took approximately two years. It was the first game developed by Atlus to feature full voice acting, and one of the company's earliest fully 3D titles. The PS2 remake changed a number of gameplay elements, introduced further cutscenes, adjusted the music, and added the third-person <b>perspective</b> <b>in</b> response to a common trend in Japan of first-person games causing motion sickness. The game sold well in Japan, and was met with mixed to positive reviews worldwide.|$|E

5|$|During 1992 and 1993, an {{estimated}} 225,000 Croats, {{as well as}} refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia, settled in Croatia. Croatian volunteers and some conscripted soldiers participated {{in the war in}} Bosnia and Herzegovina. In September 1992, Croatia had accepted 335,985 refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina, most of whom were Bosniak civilians (excluding men of drafting age). The large number of refugees significantly strained the Croatian economy and infrastructure. The American Ambassador to Croatia, Peter Galbraith, tried to put the number of Muslim refugees in Croatia into a proper <b>perspective</b> <b>in</b> an interview on 8 November 1993. He said the situation would be the equivalent of the United States taking in 30,000,000 refugees.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the game}} was still marred by {{technical}} difficulties, so Bob Fitch completely redesigned the Warcraft II engine within two months to ensure {{that many of the}} features desired by the designers, such as the abilities for units to burrow and cloak, could be implemented. Later improvements to the game included pre-rendered sprites and backgrounds, constructed using 3D Studio Max. An isometric in-game view was also adopted, in contrast to Warcraft IIs 3/4s birdseye <b>perspective.</b> <b>In</b> addition, the game utilized high quality music, composed by Blizzard's resident composers, and professional voice actors were hired.|$|E
5|$|In Shin Megami Tensei II, {{the player}} takes {{the role of}} the gladiator Hawk, who is able to {{communicate}} with demons. The gameplay {{is similar to that of}} the first Shin Megami Tensei: the game is controlled from a first-person view, and has the player exploring dungeons and navigating outdoor areas, which are presented as 2D maps seen from a top-down <b>perspective.</b> <b>In</b> both these types of areas, the player encounters and battles against demons; a gauge on the bottom of the screen shows the likelihood of a demon encounter.|$|E

5|$|Like its {{predecessors}} Descent and Descent II, Descent 3 is a {{six degrees of}} freedom shooter where the player controls a flying ship from a first-person <b>perspective</b> <b>in</b> zero-gravity. It is differentiated from standard first-person shooters in that it allows the player to move and rotate in any 3D direction. Specifically, the player is free to move forward/backward, up/down, left/right, and rotate in three perpendicular axes, often termed pitch, yaw, and roll. Aboard the ship, the player can shoot enemies, turn on the ship's afterburners to temporarily increase its acceleration and speed, and fire flares or turn on the ship's headlight to explore darkened areas.|$|E
5|$|The ARCHER imaging system, mounted {{aboard the}} GA8 Airvan, uses visible and {{near-infrared}} light {{to examine the}} surface of the Earth and find suspected crash sites, evaluate areas affected by disasters, or examine foliage from an airborne <b>perspective</b> <b>in</b> order to flag possible marijuana plantations. Both the SDIS and ARCHER systems were used to great success in the response to Hurricane Katrina; ARCHER may be used in coordination with the SDIS system.|$|E
5|$|The State Secretary and {{assistant}} to Vanhanen, Risto Volanen, said that attacks on schools {{could no longer}} be considered isolated incidents, and that police and security forces had to approach them with a new <b>perspective</b> <b>in</b> the aftermath of Kauhajoki. In December 2009, plans were announced to include an emergency SMS system in schools, more emergency exits, and better access to the architectural lay-out of school buildings for police. Each school is to undergo a risk assessment before the implementation of this plan.|$|E

5|$|The jealous {{attention}} {{which has}} been paid to the unities both of time and place has taken away the principle of <b>perspective</b> <b>in</b> the drama, and all the interest which objects derive from distance, from contrast, from privation, from change of fortune, from long-cherished passion; and contrasts our view of life from a strange and romantic dream, long, obscure, and infinite, into a smartly contested, three hours' inaugural disputation on its merits by the different candidates for theatrical applause.|$|E
5|$|The {{rudiments of}} {{perspective}} arrived with Giotto (1266/7 – 1337), {{who attempted to}} draw in perspective using an algebraic method to determine the placement of distant lines. In 1415, the Italian architect Filippo Brunelleschi and his friend Leon Battista Alberti demonstrated the geometrical method of applying <b>perspective</b> <b>in</b> Florence, using similar triangles as formulated by Euclid, to find the apparent height of distant objects. Brunelleschi's own perspective paintings are lost, but Masaccio's painting of the Holy Trinity shows his principles at work.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{theories}} proposed regarding the development of modern human behavior, but in recent years the mosaic approach has been the most favored <b>perspective</b> <b>in</b> regards to the MSA, especially when taken in consideration with the archaeological evidence.

5|$|Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528) was a German Renaissance {{printmaker}} {{who made}} important contributions to polyhedral literature in his 1525 book, Underweysung der Messung (Education on Measurement), meant {{to teach the}} subjects of linear perspective, geometry in architecture, Platonic solids, and regular polygons. Dürer was likely influenced by the works of Luca Pacioli and Piero della Francesca during his trips to Italy. While the examples of <b>perspective</b> <b>in</b> Underweysung der Messung are underdeveloped and contain inaccuracies, there is a detailed discussion of polyhedra. Dürer is also the first to introduce in text the idea of polyhedral nets, polyhedra unfolded to lie flat for printing. Dürer published another influential book on human proportions called Vier Bücher von Menschlicher Proportion (Four Books on Human Proportion) in 1528.|$|E
5|$|As the {{reputation}} of the Mars Works grew, so too did the demand for its products. After a few years the Mars Works began exporting its engines inland. Oliver Evans's son George was the first such order, having moved to Pittsburgh in 1809 to operate the Pittsburgh Steam Flour Mill. George and the mill were highly successful, and generated a great deal of interest in Evans's engines across the interior. However exporting engines to western Pennsylvania, Kentucky or Ohio was challenging and expensive from a logistical <b>perspective.</b> <b>In</b> 1811 Evans and George, as well as another successful steam miller and engineer Luther Stephens, founded the Pittsburgh Steam Engine Company, which in addition to engines would, like the Mars Works, produce heavy machinery and castings in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. With high demand for industrial products and relatively little industrial capacity, the Pittsburgh works added to its repertoire the capacity for brasswork, as well as producing finer products for domestic purposes like hinges and fittings.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the game, a wave of Luftwaffe {{aircraft}} (in the appearance of Balkenkreuz sprites on the map) will cross the English Channel and proceed to bomb various cities, air bases and radar installations. In response, RAF squadrons are automatically scrambled and will await orders to either engage invading Luftwaffe fighters or to defend key cities from bombers. When a RAF squadron has successfully engaged a Luftwaffe unit on the map, the game will shift to a first-person shooter <b>perspective,</b> <b>in</b> which the point of view is portrayed from a cockpit of either a Spitfire or Messerschmitt Bf 109, depending on the side chosen. During the dogfight sequence, the number of Luftwaffe casualties will depend on how many aircraft the player was able to shoot down.|$|E
5|$|Clock Tower 3 is a {{survival}} horror game played from a fixed third-person camera <b>perspective</b> <b>in</b> which players control 14-year-old school girl Alyssa Hamilton. Clock Tower 3 {{is the first}} game in the series to incorporate direct control over the protagonist, {{as opposed to the}} point-and-click gameplay used in the previous games. To progress through the game, the player must find items to unlock new areas, solve puzzles, and flee and hide from enemies ("Subordinates"). Eventually, each Subordinate must be defeated in battle. Throughout each level, the player also encounters the spirits of innocent people slain by the Subordinates. These spirits will attack Alyssa if she approaches them. In order to pacify them, an item of sentimental value must be found and returned to the spirit's corpse.|$|E
5|$|Feminism {{became a}} {{principal}} concern of musicologists in the 1980s {{as part of}} the New Musicology. Prior to this, in the 1970s, musicologists were beginning to discover women composers and performers, and had begun to review concepts of canon, genius, genre and periodization from a feminist <b>perspective.</b> <b>In</b> other words, the question of how women musicians fit into traditional music history was now being asked. Through the 1980s and 1990s, this trend continued as musicologists like Susan McClary, Marcia Citron and Ruth Solie began to consider the cultural reasons for the marginalizing of women from the received body of work. Concepts such as music as gendered discourse; professionalism; reception of women's music; examination of the sites of music production; relative wealth and education of women; popular music studies in relation to women's identity; patriarchal ideas in music analysis; and notions of gender and difference are among the themes examined during this time.|$|E
