5|$|It is {{not known}} what human organs are {{affected}} by interaction with promethium; a possible candidate is the bone tissues. Sealed promethium-147 is not dangerous. However, if the packaging is damaged, then <b>promethium</b> becomes dangerous {{to the environment and}} humans. If radioactive contamination is found, the contaminated area should be washed with water and soap, but, even though <b>promethium</b> mainly affects the skin, the skin should not be abraded. If a <b>promethium</b> leak is found, the area should be identified as hazardous and evacuated, and emergency services must be contacted. No dangers from <b>promethium</b> aside from the radioactivity are known.|$|E
5|$|<b>Promethium</b> (formerly prometheum) is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Pm and atomic number 61. All of its isotopes are radioactive; {{it is one}} of only two such elements that are followed in the periodic table by elements with stable forms, a distinction shared with technetium. Chemically, <b>promethium</b> is a lanthanide, which forms salts when combined with other elements. <b>Promethium</b> shows only one stable oxidation state of +3.|$|E
5|$|<b>Promethium</b> {{has also}} been {{identified}} in the spectrum of the star HR 465 in Andromeda; it also {{has been found in}} HD 101065 (Przybylski's star) and HD 965. Because of the short half-life of <b>promethium</b> isotopes, they should be formed near the surface of those stars.|$|E
5|$|<b>Promethium</b> is {{also used}} to measure the {{thickness}} of materials by evaluating the amount of radiation from a <b>promethium</b> source that passes through the sample. It has possible future uses in portable X-ray sources, and as auxiliary heat or power sources for space probes and satellites (although the alpha emitter plutonium-238 has become standard for most space-exploration-related uses).|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the 1960s, Oak Ridge National Laboratory could produce 650grams of <b>promethium</b> per year and was the world's only large-volume {{synthesis}} facility. Gram-scale production of <b>promethium</b> has been discontinued in the U.S. in the early 1980s, but will possibly be resumed after 2010 at the High Flux Isotope Reactor. Currently, Russia {{is the only country}} producing promethium-147 on a relatively large scale.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, ion-exchange {{methods were}} used at ORNL to prepare about ten grams of <b>promethium</b> from nuclear reactor fuel {{processing}} wastes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Promethium</b> is {{the only}} {{lanthanide}} and {{one of only two}} elements among the first 83 that has no stable (or even long-lived) isotopes. This is a result of a rarely occurring effect of the liquid drop model and stabilities of neighbor element isotopes; it is also the least stable element of the first 84. The primary decay products are neodymium and samarium isotopes (promethium-146 decays to both, the lighter isotopes generally to neodymium via positron decay and electron capture, and the heavier isotopes to samarium via beta decay). <b>Promethium</b> nuclear isomers may decay to other <b>promethium</b> isotopes and one isotope (145Pm) has a very rare alpha decay mode to stable praseodymium-141.|$|E
5|$|The <b>promethium</b> sample {{produced}} {{was used}} to measure a few of the metal's properties, such as its melting point.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{possible}} sources for natural promethium: rare decays of natural europium-151 (producing promethium-147), and uranium (various isotopes). Practical applications exist only for chemical compounds of promethium-147, {{which are used}} in luminous paint, atomic batteries and thickness measurement devices, even though promethium-145 is the most stable <b>promethium</b> isotope. Because natural <b>promethium</b> is exceedingly scarce, it is typically synthesized by bombarding uranium-235 (enriched uranium) with thermal neutrons to produce promethium-147 as a fission product.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Willard Libby {{reported}} that he had found weak beta activity in pure neodymium, which was attributed to a half-life over 1012years. Almost 20 years later, it was claimed that the element occurs in natural neodymium in equilibrium in quantities below 10−20 grams of <b>promethium</b> per one gram of neodymium. However, these observations were disproved by newer investigations, because for all seven naturally occurring neodymium isotopes, any single beta decays (which can produce <b>promethium</b> isotopes) are forbidden by energy conservation. In particular, careful measurements of atomic masses show that the mass difference 150Nd-150Pm is negative (−87keV), which absolutely prevents the single beta decay of 150Nd to 150Pm. In 1965 O. Erämetsä separated out traces of 145Pm from a rare earth concentrate purified from and apatite, resulting in an upper limit of 10−21 for the abundance of <b>promethium</b> in nature; this may have been produced by the natural nuclear fission of uranium, or by cosmic ray spallation of 146Nd.|$|E
5|$|<b>Promethium</b> has {{a double}} {{hexagonal}} close packed (dhcp) structure and a hardness of 63kg/mm2. This low-temperature alpha form converts into a beta, body-centered cubic (bcc) phase upon heating to 890°C.|$|E
5|$|Today, <b>promethium</b> {{is still}} {{recovered}} from the byproducts of uranium fission; {{it can also be}} produced by bombarding 146Nd with neutrons, turning it into 147Nd which decays into 147Pm through beta decay with a half-life of 11 days.|$|E
5|$|Alien Rage {{takes place}} on an {{asteroid}} which humans and an alien species known as Vorus were jointly mining for <b>Promethium,</b> a highly efficient source of energy. After the Vorus turn on the humans and wipe the miners out, Jack, the player character, {{is sent to the}} mining facility to kill the aliens and destroy the facility.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>promethium</b> is {{used only}} for {{research}} purposes, except for promethium-147, {{which can be found}} outside laboratories. It is obtained as the oxide or chloride, in milligram quantities. This isotope does not emit gamma rays, and its radiation has a relatively small penetration depth in matter and a relatively long half-life.|$|E
5|$|The {{long-lived}} isotopes,146Sm, 147Sm, and 148Sm, primarily decay by {{emission of}} alpha particles to isotopes of neodymium. Lighter unstable isotopes of samarium primarily decay by electron capture to isotopes of <b>promethium,</b> while heavier ones convert through beta decay to isotopes of europium.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, four {{predicted}} {{elements were}} still {{missing from the}} periodic table: 43 (technetium) and 61 (<b>promethium)</b> are radioactive elements and are only present in trace amounts in the environment, thus making elements 75 (rhenium) and 72 (hafnium) the last two unknown non-radioactive elements. Since rhenium was discovered in 1908, hafnium was the last element with stable isotopes to be discovered.|$|E
5|$|Many {{properties}} of <b>promethium</b> rely on its position among lanthanides and are intermediate between those of neodymium and samarium. For example, the melting point, {{the first three}} ionization energies, and the hydration energy are greater than those of neodymium and {{lower than those of}} samarium; similarly, the estimate for the boiling point, ionic (Pm3+) radius, and standard heat of formation of monatomic gas are greater than those of samarium and less those of neodymium.|$|E
5|$|<b>Promethium</b> forms {{only one}} stable {{oxidation}} state, +3, {{in the form}} of ions; this is in line with other lanthanides. According to its position in the periodic table, the element cannot be expected to form stable +4 or +2 oxidation states; treating chemical compounds containing Pm3+ ions with strong oxidizing or reducing agents showed that the ion is not easily oxidized or reduced.|$|E
5|$|Some {{signal lights}} use a {{luminous}} paint, containing a phosphor that absorbs the beta radiation emitted by promethium-147 and emits light. This isotope {{does not cause}} aging of the phosphor, as alpha emitters do, and therefore the light emission is stable for a few years. Originally, radium-226 {{was used for the}} purpose, but it was later replaced by promethium-147 and tritium (hydrogen-3). <b>Promethium</b> may be favored over tritium for nuclear safety reasons.|$|E
5|$|Technetium, with {{atomic number}} (denoted Z) 43, is the lowest-numbered {{element in the}} {{periodic}} table of which all isotopes are radioactive. The second-lightest exclusively radioactive element, <b>promethium,</b> has an atomic number of 61. Atomic nuclei with an odd number of protons are less stable than those with even numbers, even when {{the total number of}} nucleons (protons + neutrons) is even, and odd numbered elements have fewer stable isotopes.|$|E
5|$|The element {{also has}} 18 nuclear isomers, with mass numbers of 133 to 142, 144, 148, 149, 152, and 154 (some mass numbers {{have more than}} one isomer). The most stable of them is promethium-148m, with a {{half-life}} of 43.1days; this is longer than the half-lives of the ground states of all <b>promethium</b> isotopes, except for promethium-143 to 147. In fact, promethium-148m has a longer half-life than its ground state, promethium-148.|$|E
5|$|Thulium is the second-least {{abundant}} of the lanthanides after <b>promethium,</b> {{which is}} only found in trace quantities on Earth. It is an easily workable metal with a bright silvery-gray luster. It is fairly soft and slowly tarnishes in air. Despite its high price and rarity, thulium is used as the radiation source in portable X-ray devices, and in some solid-state lasers. It has no significant biological role and is not particularly toxic.|$|E
5|$|A <b>promethium</b> atom has 61 electrons, {{arranged}} in the configuration 4f56s2. In forming compounds, the atom loses its two outermost electrons {{and one of}} the 4f-electrons, which belongs to an open subshell. The element's atomic radius is the third largest among all the lanthanides but is only slightly greater than those of the neighboring elements. It is the only exception to the general trend of the contraction of the atoms with increase of atomic radius (caused by the lanthanide contraction) that is not caused by the filled (or half-filled) 4f-subshell.|$|E
5|$|Like the lanthanides, the {{actinides}} form {{a family}} of elements with similar properties. Within the actinides, there are two overlapping groups: transuranium elements, which follow uranium in the periodic table—and transplutonium elements, which follow plutonium. Compared to the lanthanides, which (except for <b>promethium)</b> are found in nature in appreciable quantities, most actinides are rare. The majority {{of them do not}} even occur in nature, and of those that do, only thorium and uranium do so in more than trace quantities. The most abundant, or easily synthesized actinides are uranium and thorium, followed by plutonium, americium, actinium, protactinium, neptunium, and curium.|$|E
5|$|Scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, and {{lutetium}} tend {{to occur}} {{together with the}} other lanthanides (except <b>promethium)</b> tend to occur together in the Earth's crust, and are often harder to extract from their ores. The abundance of elements in Earth's crust for group 3 is quite low — all the elements in the group are uncommon, the most abundant being yttrium with abundance of approximately 30parts per million (ppm); the abundance of scandium is 16ppm, while that of lutetium is about 0.5ppm. The abundance of lanthanum is greater, being about 35ppm. For comparison, the abundance of copper is 50ppm, that of chromium is 160ppm, and that of molybdenum is 1.5ppm.|$|E
5|$|The La3+ ion is similarly-sized to {{the early}} {{lanthanides}} of the cerium group (those up to samarium and europium) that immediately follow in the periodic table, and hence it tends to occur along with them in phosphate, silicate and carbonate minerals, such as monazite (MIIIPO4) and bastnäsite (MIIICO3F), where M refers to all the rare earth metals except scandium and the radioactive <b>promethium</b> (mostly Ce, La, and Y). Bastnäsite is usually lacking in thorium and the heavy lanthanides, and the purification of the light lanthanides from it is less involved. The ore, after being crushed and ground, is first treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid, evolving carbon dioxide, hydrogen fluoride, and silicon tetrafluoride: the product is then dried and leached with water, leaving the early lanthanide ions, including lanthanum, in solution.|$|E
5|$|A {{neptunium}} atom has 93 electrons, {{arranged in}} the configuration 5f46d17s2. This {{differs from the}} configuration expected by the Aufbau principle in that one electron is in the 6d subshell instead of being as expected in the 5f subshell. This {{is because of the}} similarity of the electron energies of the 5f, 6d, and 7s subshells. In forming compounds and ions, all the valence electrons may be lost, leaving behind an inert core of inner electrons with the electron configuration of the noble gas radon; more commonly, only some of the valence electrons will be lost. The electron configuration for the tripositive ion Np3+ is 5f4, with the outermost 7s and 6d electrons lost first: this is exactly analogous to neptunium's lanthanide homolog <b>promethium,</b> and conforms to the trend set by the other actinides with their 5fn electron configurations in the tripositive state. The first ionization potential of neptunium was measured to be at most (6.19±0.12)eV in 1974, {{based on the assumption that}} the 7s electrons would ionize before 5f and 6d; more recent measurements have refined this to 6.2657eV.|$|E
5|$|All but two {{elements}} up to bismuth (element 83) have an isotope that is practically stable for all purposes ("classically stable"), with the exceptions being technetium and <b>promethium</b> (elements 43 and 61). All elements from polonium (element 84) onward are measurably radioactive. 232Th {{is one of}} the three nuclides beyond bismuth (the other two being 235U and 238U) that have half-lives measured in billions of years; its half-life is 14.05billionyears, about three times the age of the earth, and slightly longer than the age of the universe. Four-fifths of the thorium present at Earth's formation has survived to the present. 232Th is the only isotope of thorium occurring in quantity in nature, and thorium is usually considered to be a mononuclidic element. Its stability is attributed to its closed nuclear shell with 142 neutrons. Thorium has a characteristic terrestrial isotopic composition, with atomic weight 232.0377(4). It is one of only three radioactive elements (along with protactinium and uranium) that occur in large enough quantities on Earth for this to be possible.|$|E
5|$|Heavy metals {{or their}} {{compounds}} {{can be found}} in electronic components, electrodes, and wiring and solar panels where they may be used as either conductors, semiconductors, or insulators. Molybdenum powder is used in circuit board inks. Ruthenium(IV) oxide coated titanium anodes are used for the industrial production of chlorine. Home electrical systems, for the most part, are wired with copper wire for its good conducting properties. Silver and gold are used in electrical and electronic devices, particularly in contact switches, {{as a result of their}} high electrical conductivity and capacity to resist or minimise the formation of impurities on their surfaces. The semiconductors cadmium telluride and gallium arsenide are used to make solar panels. Hafnium oxide, an insulator, is used as a voltage controller in microchips; tantalum oxide, another insulator, is used in capacitors in mobile phones. Heavy metals have been used in batteries for over 200 years, at least since Volta invented his copper and silver voltaic pile in 1800. <b>Promethium,</b> lanthanum, and mercury are further examples found in, respectively, atomic, nickel-metal hydride, and button cell batteries.|$|E
5|$|Neptunium is a hard, silvery, ductile, {{radioactive}} actinide metal. In {{the periodic}} table, {{it is located}} {{to the right of}} the actinide uranium, to the left of the actinide plutonium and below the lanthanide <b>promethium.</b> Neptunium is a hard metal, having a bulk modulus of 118GPa, comparable to that of manganese. Neptunium metal is similar to uranium in terms of physical workability. When exposed to air at normal temperatures, it forms a thin oxide layer. This reaction proceeds more rapidly as the temperature increases. Neptunium has been determined to melt at 639±3°C: this low melting point, a property the metal shares with the neighboring element plutonium (which has melting point 639.4°C), is due to the hybridization of the 5f and 6d orbitals and the formation of directional bonds in the metal. The boiling point of neptunium is not empirically known and the usually given value of 4174°C is extrapolated from the vapor pressure of the element. If accurate, this would give neptunium the largest liquid range of any element (3535K passes between its melting and boiling points).|$|E
5|$|The Pr3+ ion {{is similar}} in size to the early {{lanthanides}} of the cerium group (those from lanthanum up to samarium and europium) that immediately follow in the periodic table, and hence it tends to occur along with them in phosphate, silicate and carbonate minerals, such as monazite (MIIIPO4) and bastnäsite (MIIICO3F), where M refers to all the rare-earth metals except scandium and the radioactive <b>promethium</b> (mostly Ce, La, and Y, with somewhat less Nd and Pr). Bastnäsite is usually lacking in thorium and the heavy lanthanides, and the purification of the light lanthanides from it is less involved. The ore, after being crushed and ground, is first treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid, evolving carbon dioxide, hydrogen fluoride, and silicon tetrafluoride. The product is then dried and leached with water, leaving the early lanthanide ions, including lanthanum, in solution.|$|E
5|$|The {{element is}} never {{found in nature}} in pure form, but it is found in small {{quantities}} in minerals with other rare earths. Thulium is often found with minerals containing yttrium and gadolinium. In particular, thulium occurs in the mineral gadolinite. However, thulium also occurs in the minerals monazite, xenotime, and euxenite. Its abundance in the Earth's crust is 0.5mg/kg by weight and 50 parts per billion by moles. Thulium makes up approximately 0.5 parts per million of soil, although this value can range from 0.4 to 0.8 parts per million. Thulium makes up 250 parts per quadrillion of seawater. In the solar system, thulium exists in concentrations of 200 parts per trillion by weight and 1part per trillion by moles. Thulium ore occurs most commonly in China. However, Australia, Brazil, Greenland, India, Tanzania, and the United States also have large reserves of thulium. Total reserves of thulium are approximately 100,000 tonnes. Thulium is the least abundant lanthanide on earth except for <b>promethium.</b>|$|E
25|$|Rare-earth elements, except scandium, are {{heavier than}} iron {{and thus are}} {{produced}} by supernova nucleosynthesis or the s-process in asymptotic giant branch stars. In nature, spontaneous fission of uranium-238 produces trace amounts of radioactive <b>promethium,</b> but most <b>promethium</b> is synthetically produced in nuclear reactors.|$|E
25|$|The rare-earth {{elements}} are often found together. The longest-lived isotope of <b>promethium</b> has a half-life of 17.7 years, so the element exists in nature in only negligible amounts (approximately 572g {{in the entire}} Earth's crust). <b>Promethium</b> {{is one of the}} two elements that do not have stable (non-radioactive) isotopes and are followed by (i.e. with higher atomic number) stable elements (the other being technetium).|$|E
25|$|Radioactive decay {{may lead}} to {{spontaneous}} fission. This is not cluster decay, as the fission products may be split among nearly any type of atom. Thorium-232, uranium-235, and uranium-238 are primordial isotopes that undergo spontaneous fission. Natural technetium and <b>promethium</b> are produced in this manner.|$|E
25|$|The {{elements}} tantalum and niobium {{are always}} found together in nature, {{and have been}} named after the King Tantalus and his daughter Niobe. The element <b>promethium</b> also draws its name from Greek mythology, as does titanium, which was named after the titans who in mythology were locked away far underground, which reflected the difficulty of extracting titanium from ore.|$|E
