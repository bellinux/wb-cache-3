40|$|SummaryHypothesisClinically, subscapularis tendon {{tears are}} {{suggested}} {{by the presence of}} increased passive external rotation compared to the opposite side, resisted internal rotation manoeuvres (Lift-Off test [LOT], Belly-Press test [BPT], Napoleon test and Bear-Hug test [BHT] and positive Internal Rotation Lag Sign and/or Belly-Off Signs). Associated bicipital involvement is frequent with subscapularis tendon tears, because it participates {{in the formation of the}} biceps pulley. The <b>Palm-Up</b> <b>test</b> (PUT) is used for the biceps, and the Jobe test for the supraspinatus. Material and methodsIn this multicenter study, we evaluated the positive diagnostic value of the clinical tests, LOT, BPT, BHT, PUT, and the Jobe test for subscapularis tears as well as their anatomical value. The relationships of the different parameters studied were compared statistically by analysis of variance (ANOVA). This prospective multicenter study was performed from January 2009 to February 2010 and included 208 cases of subscapularis tendon tears, isolated or associated with partial (Ellman 1, 2 or 3) or full thickness (SFA stage 1) supraspinatus tears. ResultsThe severity of the subscapularis tear was quantified according to the SFA classification into four stages and according to the level of injury (the lower 1 / 3 and upper 2 / 3). The three tests LOT, BPT and BHT were correlated to the severity of observed tears (P< 0. 05). The more deficient the test results were, the more severe the anatomical damage. The LOT is the test that cannot be performed most often (18 %) but when it is positive, it is predictive of very severe tears. The BHT is the most sensitive of all tests (82 %). The frequency of biceps involvement was correlated to the severity of subscapularis damage. There was no significant correlation between biceps involvement and subscapularis tests, or between supraspinatus involvement and subscapularis tests. There was no correlation between the <b>Palm-Up</b> <b>test</b> and subscapularis tears with associated supraspinatus involvement however, it was significantly correlated to biceps involvement (P< 0. 05). The Jobe test was disappointing because it was often positive even for isolated subscapularis tears. ConclusionEven though all three tests were performed (LOT, BPT, BHT), 24 % of the subscapularis tears were only diagnosed during surgery. The role of the Internal Rotation Lag Sign and Belly-Off Sign in improving the diagnosis of tears was not studied in this work. Level of evidenceII...|$|E
40|$|An os acromiale (OA) {{arises from}} a fusion {{failure of the}} {{anterior}} acromial apophysis. This case report presents the successful management of a painful OA associated to rotator cuff impingement in a competitive swimmer, based on ultrasonographic diagnosis and conservative management. Rest from sport activity, oral anti-inflammatory drugs and previous attempt of treatment of shoulder pain were ineffective. After two months of conservative treatment consisting of avoidance of swimming, local anti-inflammatory, physical therapy with ice, strengthening exercises with elastic bands to strengthen the scapular stabilizing muscles, rotator cuff and lowering humeral head muscles, the patient was pain free and all specific clinical tests for impingement syndrome (Neer, Hawkins, Whipple and Yocum tests) were negative. Digital compression of the OA site was not painful, and the Jobe and <b>Palm-up</b> <b>tests</b> were negative. The athlete returned to swim continuing the rehabilitation exercises, and the successful results were maintained at one year follow up. An unstable and symptomatic OA can be easily diagnosed with ultrasound exam. Rehabilitation for rotator cuff tendinopathies or/and bursitis can be a valid alternative to surgery. Key pointsAn os acromiale (OA) arises from a fusion failure of the anterior acromial apophysis. A correct diagnosis of OA associated to rotator cuff impingement can be performed by ultrasonographic exam. A conservative management of rotator cuff impingement syndrome, associated to OA, can be planned in athletic patients as a valid alternative to surgery...|$|R
