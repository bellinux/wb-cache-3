As of December 2014, two women (and three men) serve as legal representatives of the church in Northern Mexico. Public relations positions that have been held by women include spokesperson, director of social communication, and assistant director of international affairs. Within church operated civil organizations women also occupy executive positions such as director of La Luz del Mundo Family Services, a violence <b>prevention</b> <b>and</b> <b>intervention</b> center in South Side, Milwaukee; Director of Social Work and Psychology within the Ministry of Social Welfare; director of the Samuel Joaquín Flores Foundation; president of Recab de México A.C.; and director of the Association of Students and Professionals in the USA.|$|E

Community screening for domestic violence can be more systematic in cases of animal abuse, healthcare settings, emergency departments, behavioral health settings and court systems. Tools are being developed to facilitate domestic violence screening such as mobile apps. The Duluth Model or Domestic Abuse Intervention Project is a program developed to reduce domestic violence against women, {{which is the first}} multi-disciplinary program designed {{to address the issue of}} domestic violence by coordinating the actions of a variety of agencies dealing with domestic conflict.|$|E

500|$|In 1988, Bowlby {{published}} {{a series of}} lectures indicating how attachment theory and research {{could be used in}} understanding and treating child and family disorders. His focus for bringing about change was the parents' internal working models, parenting behaviours and the parents' relationship with the therapeutic intervenor. Ongoing research has led to a number of individual treatments and <b>prevention</b> <b>and</b> <b>intervention</b> programmes. In regards to personal development, children from all the age groups were tested to show the effectiveness of the theory that is being theorized by Bowlby [...] They range from individual therapy to public health programmes to interventions designed for foster caregivers. For infants and younger children, the focus is on increasing the responsiveness and sensitivity of the caregiver, or if that is not possible, placing the child with a different caregiver. An assessment of the attachment status or caregiving responses of the caregiver is invariably included, as attachment is a two-way process involving attachment behaviour and caregiver response. Some programmes are aimed at foster carers because the attachment behaviours of infants or children with attachment difficulties often do not elicit appropriate caregiver responses. Modern <b>prevention</b> <b>and</b> <b>intervention</b> programmes have proven successful.|$|E
2500|$|Bullying is abusive social {{interaction}} between peers which can include aggression, harassment, and violence. Bullying is typically repetitive and enacted {{by those who}} are in a position of power over the victim. A growing body of research illustrates a significant relationship between bullying and emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence (EI) is a set of abilities related to the understanding, use and management of emotion as it relates to one's self and others. Mayer et al., (2008) defines the dimensions of overall EI as: [...] "accurately perceiving emotion, using emotions to facilitate thought, understanding emotion, and managing emotion". The concept combines emotional and intellectual processes. Lower emotional intelligence appears to be related to involvement in bullying, as the bully and/or the victim of bullying. EI seems {{to play an important role}} in both bullying behavior and victimization in bullying; given that EI is illustrated to be malleable, EI education could greatly improve bullying <b>prevention</b> <b>and</b> <b>intervention</b> initiatives.|$|E
