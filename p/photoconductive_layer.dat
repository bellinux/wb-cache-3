40|$|Recently, {{the world}} of {{diagnostic}} radiography has seen the integration of digital flat panel x-ray image detectors into x-ray imaging systems, replacing analog film screens. These flat panel x-ray imagers (FPXIs) {{have been shown to}} produce high quality x-ray images and provide many advantages that are inherent to a fully digital technology. Direct conversion FPXIs based on a <b>photoconductive</b> <b>layer</b> of stabilized amorphous selenium (a-Se) have been commercialized and have proven particularly effective in the field of mammography. In the operation of these detectors, incident x-ray photons are converted directly to charge carriers in the a-Se layer and drifted to electrodes {{on either side of the}} layer by a large applied field (10 V/μm). The applied field causes a dark current to flow which is not due to the incident radiation and this becomes a source of noise which can reduce the dynamic range of the detector. The level of dark current in commercialized detectors has been reduced by the deposition of thin n- and p- type blocking layers between the electrodes and the bulk of the a-Se. Despite recent research into the dark current in metal/a-Se/metal sandwich structures, much is still unknown about the true cause and nature of this phenomenon. The work in this Ph. D. thesis describes an experimental and theoretical study of the dark current in these structures. Experiments have been performed on five separate sets of a-Se samples which approximate the <b>photoconductive</b> <b>layer</b> in an FPXI. The dark current has been measured as a function of time, sample structure, applied field, sample thickness and contact metal used. This work has conclusively shown that the dark current is almost entirely due to the injection of charge carriers from the contacts and the contribution of Poole-Frenkel enhanced bulk thermal generation is negligible. There is also evidence that while the dark current is initially controlled by the injection of holes from the positive contact, several minutes after the application of the bias, the dark current due to hole injection may decay to the point where the electron current becomes significant and even dominant. These conclusions are supported by numerical calculations of the dark current transients which have been calibrated to match experimental results. Work detailed in this Ph. D. thesis also focuses on Monte Carlo modeling of the x-ray sensitivity of a-Se FPXIs. The higher the x-ray sensitivity of a detector, the lower the radiation dose required to acquire an acceptable image. FPXIs can experience a decrease in the x-ray sensitivity of the <b>photoconductive</b> <b>layer</b> with accumulating exposure, leading to a phenomenon known as “ghosting”. Modeling this decrease in sensitivity can uncover the reasons behind it. The Monte Carlo model described in this thesis is a continuation of a previous model which now considers the effects of the n- and p-like blocking layers and the flow of dark current between x-ray exposures. The simulation results explain how deep trapping of photogenerated charge carriers, and the resulting effect on the electric field distribution, contribute to sensitivity loss. The model has shown excellent agreement with experimental data and has accurately predicted a sensitivity recovery once exposure has ceased which is due to primarily to the relaxation of metastable x-ray-induced carrier trap states...|$|E

40|$|A novel ODEP (optical dielectrophoresis) chip using a polymer {{photoconductive}} {{material and}} fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) conductive film is demonstrated to manipulate micron-sized polystyrene beads. Instead {{of using the}} traditional hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) as <b>photoconductive</b> <b>layers,</b> a thin film of a mixture of poly (3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) and [6, 6]-phenyl C 61 -butyric acid methylester (PCBM) photoconductive polymer is used in this novel ODEP chip. When the polymer layer is illuminated by a light beam, many electron-hole pairs are created, which increase the conductivity of the polymer. Consequently, localized non-uniform electric field can be generated when an AC bias is applied across the ODEP chip, and localized DEP forces are then generated. The distribution of electrical field induced by a ring-shaped optical electrode is simulated and the maximum trapping velocity is calculated according to Stokes&# 39; law for this ODEP chip. The effect of the polymer thickness to {{the magnitude of the}} generated DEP force has also been investigated. The maximum trapping velocity and the induced DEP force exerted on 20 μm polystyrene beads are estimated to be 77 μm/s and 15 pN, respectively. Finally, performance of the polymer-based ODEP chip is compared with an a-Si:H-based ODEP chip by trapping and sorting polystyrene beads with identical parameters.

The long-ranged DEP force can compete with the hydrodynamic force by alternating current electro-osmosis (ACEO) over the entire illumination area for realizing effective field separation of particles. In the OEFS system, the codirectional illumination and observation induce the levitation effect, compensating the attenuation of the DEP force under LIG illumination by slightly floating particles from the surface.

The detectors consist of a double-emulsion portal film secured between plates of aluminum, copper, brass or lead with thicknesses from 0 to 4. 81 mm. The study of MTF, NPS, and DQE shows that both photons and secondary electrons produced within the front-plate and backscattered electrons from the back-plate affect metal/film portal imaging. Study of DQE indicates that the best portal detectors are those without back-plates, and with high density front-plates with thicknesses less than the maximum electron range. This MTF data was modeled with the logit analysis. It is shown that the parameters resulting from the logit analysis depend on the mass thickness and the atomic number of the metal plates. Metal/amorphous selenium (a-Se) electrostatic-based detectors {{have been developed for}} portal imaging. The detectors consist of a-Se <b>photoconductive</b> <b>layers</b> of varied thicknesses deposited on plates of varying thicknesses of aluminum, copper, and stainless steel. The metal-plates of the detectors face the incident 6 MV and Co- 60 photon spectra during imaging. The sensitivity of the a-Se detectors to dose, electric field across the a-Se layer, plate type, and a-Se thickness is studied. A model showing a cubic relationship between the a-Se latent surface voltage and dose is derived and experimentally verified. A contrast-detail phantom is used to study the image quality and contrast-resolution characteristics of the metal/a-Se detectors. The metal/a-Se detectors produce better quality contrast-detailed images at a considerably lower dose than that offered by the other commercial available portal systems, mainly due to the low inherent noise of the novel detectors. A semi-automatic technique for the direct set-up alignment of radiosurgical circular fields from an isocentric linac to treatment room laser cross-hairs is described. Because film or a-Se is each sensitive to laser and ionizing radiation, they are used to acquire images of the positioning lasers superimposed directly onto the radiosurgical circular fields. An algorithm extracts the coordinates of the center of the collimator image and of the intersection of the laser cross-hair image and subsequently determines the deviation, to within a precision of ∼ 0. 04 mm.

40|$|Interactions {{of light}} and {{electricity}} within matter have been known and studied {{for quite a long}} time. However, a systematic exploration of many relations among optical and electronic phenomena has a more recent history. Solid state optoelectronics is concerned with the technological exploitation of these relations. Photoconductivity studies illuminate the internal electronic processes in semiconductors and helps in the development of highly sensitive materials and devices. Photoconductivity is the increase in electrical conductivity of a material due to adsorption of radiation by it. Materials with special imperfections incorporated during preparation, give large signals. Cadmium sulphide and cadmium selenide are the II – VI compound semiconductors which are useful in the visible and near infrared range. For low levels of illumination (<= 301 x), cadmium sulphide is sluggish in response (response time 100 v m. sec.) while cadmium selenide has a faster response under similar conditions (30 m. sec.). Cadmium sulphide and cadmium selenide form a continuous series of substitution solid solutions and it is reasonable to expect some of these solid solutions might exhibit a broader spectral sensitivity coupled with faster response. Of the various methods available for the preparation of II – VI compound semiconductor layers, sintering of screen printed layers is, by far, the most flexible and inexpensive method for large scale preparation of highly sensitive layers. No systematic studies are reported on sintered cadmium sulphoselenide layers, though quite a large numbers of patents and reports on these for specific purposes are available besides some published literature. Systematic studies on the preparation of photoconductive grade CdS and CdSe powders and sensitization and sintering of these powders to obtain optimum photosensitivity stability have been made. Analyses of the powders and sintered layers by AAS, polarography and EPMA as well as X-ray characterization for true solid solution formation have been made. The effect of various electrode materials like indium, silver, graphite, cadmium oxide and copper are examined and the effect of diffusion of the corresponding ions into the <b>photoconductive</b> <b>layers</b> on the current-voltage behavior both in the dark illumination are examined in detail. The optoelectronics properties like spectral distribution of sensitivity with composition, lux-ampere characterization and response time studies have been measured and correlated. An attempt has been made {{for the first time in}} the case of sintered layers to further enhance the sensitivity CdSxSe(1 -x) layers, by several methods, where such high sensitivity is called for, in specific applications. The possibility of using these CdSxSe(1 -x) layers in sintered CdSxSe(1 -x) : Cu 2 S/Cu 2 Se and CdSxSe(1 -x) : Tl 2 S photovoltaic solar cells has also been examined. Photoconductive CdSxSe(1 -x) cells will continue the interest of the solid state scientists and future applications may include image intensifiers and image storage panels in solar energy conversion and in electro photography. Logic flexibility can be incorporated into optoelectronic network using threshold of photosensitivity. Such devices will tend resemble more and more that of biological neural network such as neuro-retina in vertebrates, which will response only to inputs which are characteristic of some specific behavior. Intelligence coding, language transformation and automation of thought processes are some of the lines which will continue to interest the optoelectronic scientists. ...|$|R

In this thesis to obtain reliable information about the native and light induced defect states present in a-SiGe:H alloy thin films of various germanium concentrations SSPC, DBP, transmission spectroscopy and PDS techniques have been used. A procedure based on Ritter Weiser optical formulation {{has been applied to}} calculate fringe free absolute absorption coefficient spectra of a-SiGe:H alloy thin films of various Ge% from the yield DBP and simultaneously measured transmission signals for the first time. The results have been compared with those independently measured by PDS method. In the annealed state the effects of native defect states in a-SiGe:H alloy thin films of various Ge% have been investigated. For the a-SiGe:H alloy films with Ge concentration in the range of 10 % to 30 %, hntn-products for the photogenerated free electrons is the highest, therefore they serve as the best <b>photoconductive</b> absorber <b>layer</b> in the multijunction solar cells. The effect of Ge content in amorphous silicon network clearly indicates a systematic decrease in the bandgap with increasing Ge content. The E 0 v values are almost constant around 55 meV for alloying up to 40 % Ge. Finally the changes in the defect density present in the bandgap of alloy films are inferred from the α(1. 0 eV) measured by both PDS and low bias light DBP spectrum. The difference between PDS and low bias DBP spectra is attributed to the underlying physics of these methods. The best film with lowest defect density can be prepared with alloying Ge in the range from 10 % to 40 % Ge. In the light soaked state, samples were left under white light illumination (15 suns) for determined time intervals. SSPC measurements indicate that all samples exhibit certain degree of degradation in the magnitude of sph and hntn products. The rate of α(1. 0 eV) decreases as Ge% increases in the light soaked state. Higher Ge content films (50 %, 75 %) show almost no degradation in sub-bandgap absorption. As the degradation slope of α(hν) and 1 /η nτn product are not same for all samples it can be inferred that subgap absorption and photoconductivity measurements are not controlled by the same set of defects present in the bandgap...|$|R
