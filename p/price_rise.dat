5|$|On September 24, the {{southern}} two-thirds of Georgia was declared a disaster by President Bush. The state lost 50percent of its pecan crop due to Frances, {{which led to}} a <b>price</b> <b>rise</b> in pecans by late October. Lost peach trees were expected to lower output during 2005, and increase peach prices. A disaster declaration was made for the northeast section of South Carolina on October 7. On September 10, President Bush declared 34 counties within North Carolina a disaster area, making them eligible for US$6.5million (2004 dollars) in public assistance. A Wildlife Commission removed its North Carolina Mountain State Fair exhibit due to Frances midway through the fair. Over 100,000 trout were lost due to the storm in the Pisgah, Table Rock, Marion, and Armstrong state fish hatcheries. Red Cross volunteers distributed over 200,000 gallons of water by its 600 volunteers in four days. After Frances and Hurricane Ivan, Asheville determined that it needed $14million in order to buy out willing businesses and homes within the floodplain.|$|E

Weekly micro pricing behaviour in British groceries is investigated across three leading retailers over the moderation period 2004 - 7 and crisis period 2008 - 10. We find significant price flexibility sharply distinguished from behaviour observed in most previous work. Downward price flexibility increases markedly in 2008.

25|$|One {{systemic}} {{cause for}} the <b>price</b> <b>rise</b> is held to be the diversion of food crops (maize in particular) for making first-generation biofuels. An estimated 100 million tons of grain per year are being redirected from food to fuel. (Total worldwide grain production for 2007 was just over 2000million tons.) As farmers devoted larger parts of their crops to fuel production than in previous years, land and resources available for food production were reduced correspondingly.|$|E
25|$|As {{preparations}} for the district court hearing began, the government tried to secure a wage settlement. Independent talks failed.

Sawyer threatened to impose a wage increase; that stratagem failed. Sawyer then formally gave the workers a small pay raise; once more, the talks stalled.|$|E

25|$|The mean {{annual salary}} {{of a medical}} {{specialist}} is $175,011 in the US, and $272,000 for surgeons. However, because of commodity inflation, increasing negligent costs, steep <b>price</b> <b>rise</b> of rental, the annual salary range of a medical specialist varies and is not rising as fast as other professional pay. Often, especially in the United States, physicians practice in groups of specialists within a particular medical specialty. These practice groups are often formed to help reach economies of scales in rental, insurance and staff costs {{as well as other}} benefits of practicing with other professionals and are typically governed by various legal documents.|$|E
25|$|Many {{index funds}} and {{exchange-traded}} funds attempt to replicate (before fees and expenses) {{the performance of}} the S500 by holding the same stocks as the index, in the same proportions. Many other mutual funds are benchmarked to the S500. Consequently, a company whose stock is added to the list of S500 stocks may see its stock <b>price</b> <b>rise,</b> as index funds must purchase that company's stock in order to continue tracking the S 500 index. Mutual fund managers provide index funds that track the S500, the first of which was The Vanguard Group's Vanguard500 in 1976.|$|E

25|$|The {{return of}} the boom in 2004 was claimed to be {{primarily}} {{the result of the}} large construction sector's catching up with the demand caused by the first boom. The construction sector represented nearly 12% of GDP and a large proportion of employment among young, unskilled men. A number of sources, including The Economist, warned of excessive Irish property values. 2004 saw the construction of 80,000 new homes, compared to the UK's 160,000– a nation that has 15 times Ireland's population. House prices doubled between 2000 and 2006; tax incentives were a key driver of this <b>price</b> <b>rise,</b> and the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats government subsequently received substantial criticism for these policies.|$|E
25|$|With the Industrial Relations Act {{coming into}} effect, at the {{beginning}} of August 1972 Adamson agreed with Victor Feather of the TUC to set up an independent conciliation and advice service. According to Feather both sides saw this as one means of minimising the use of the Act. Through 1973 the government, CBI and TUC tried to establish a working relationship which suited all, but were unable to do so before the economic effects of the oil <b>price</b> <b>rise</b> caused profound disruption to the British economy. On other issues Adamson was strongly supportive of the Government, including giving consistent backing to entry to the European Communities. His leadership in this area was said to be crucial.|$|E
25|$|There {{was a rough}} {{dispute between}} President Băsescu and Premier Ponta on fuel <b>price</b> <b>rise</b> by 7 cents, measure adopted since 1 April 2014. The head of state asked Victor Ponta to waive the fee he deems an {{unnecessary}} and discriminatory tax burden. Likewise, Traian Băsescu {{is convinced that the}} measure will lead to tax evasion. The measure was also criticized by opposition. Thus, on 15 March, between 8,000 and 10,000 people, members or supporters of the People's Movement Party, protested in Bucharest's George Enescu Square against Ponta's poor economic policies and wave of taxes that will be introduced once with 1 April. Romania figures among the countries with the most expensive gasoline in the world, at $7.38 per gallon (€1.41 per litre).|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine three broad issues: (a) the {{expected}} {{impact of the}} recent petrol <b>price</b> <b>rises</b> on <b>prices</b> throughout the economy, (b) {{the hypothesis that the}} economy is now less susceptible to oil <b>price</b> <b>rises</b> {{than it was in the}} 1970 s when the first major oil prices occurred, and (c) the likely distributional impacts of the petrol <b>price</b> <b>rises?</b> A modified input-output (IO) price model is used to simulate the impact of a two-fold increase in petrol prices on the sectoral and aggregate price indices in Australia. The 1996 - 97 and 1977 - 78 IO tables are used. Among the results is an estimated impact on the consumer price index of 1. 8 per cent. Also, the same petrol price shock would have consistently larger price effects in the late 1970 s than in the late 1990 s. Further, using the 1998 - 99 Household Expenditure Survey, we find that the petrol <b>price</b> <b>rises</b> are regressive...|$|R

25|$|In {{economics}} and consumer theory, a Giffen good {{is a product}} that people consume more of as the price rises and vice versa—violating the basic law of demand in microeconomics. For any other sort of good, {{as the price of}} the good rises, the substitution effect makes consumers purchase less of it, and more of substitute goods; for most goods, the income effect (due to the effective decline in available income due to more being spent on existing units of this good) reinforces this decline in demand for the good. But a Giffen good is so strongly an inferior good in the minds of consumers (being more in demand at lower incomes) that this contrary income effect more than offsets the substitution effect, and the net effect of the good's <b>price</b> <b>rise</b> is to increase demand for it.|$|E
