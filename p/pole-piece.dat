5000|$|At {{least one}} company, Audiovox, built {{and may have}} offered an {{electric}} solid-body as early as 1932. Audiovox electric guitars were built by Paul Tutmarc who is also credited as the co-inventor of the magnetic pickup along with Art Stimpson, and the fretted electric bass guitar. Bob Wisner worked for Paul converting tube radio amplifiers into guitar amplifiers and eventually developing his own amplifier circuits so Paul's instruments could be sold along with their own amplifiers. Paul was unsuccessful at obtaining a patent for his magnetic pickup as it was too similar to the telephone microphone coil sensor device. Audiovox production was handed over to Paul's son, Bud Tutmarc, who continued building these instruments under the brand, [...] "Bud-Electro" [...] until the early 1950s. Bud Tutmarc had been delegated by the senior Tutmarc the task of winding the pickup coils used on his father's and he continued producing them for his own guitars. He used horseshoe magnets in a single-coil and later a hum cancelling dual coil configuration. Bob Wisner was hired by Rickenbacher, later spelled Rickenbacker and may have passed on Tutmarc's magnetic pickup technology and helped them develop the more familiar bar magnet and <b>pole-piece</b> pickup construction still widely used today for their cast aluminum electric guitar, nicknamed The Frying Pan or The Pancake Guitar, beginning in 1933.|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} looks critically at conventional magnetic lenses in {{the light}} of present-day technology with the aim of advancing electron microscopy in its broadest sense. By optimising the cooling arrangements and heat transfer characteristics of lens windings it was possible to increase substantially the current density in the winding, and achieve a large reduction in the size of conventional magnetic electron lenses. Following investigations into the properties of solenoidal lenses, a new type of lens with only one <b>pole-piece</b> was developed. The focal properties of such lenses, which differ considerably from those. of conventional lenses, have been derived from a combination of mathematical models and experimentally measured axial flux density distributions. These properties can be profitably discussed with reference to "half-lenses". Miniature conventional twin <b>pole-piece</b> lenses and the proposed radial field single <b>pole-piece</b> lenses have been designed and constructed and both types of lenses have been evaluated by constructing miniature electron optical columns. A miniature experimental transmission electron microscope (TEM), a miniature scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a scanning transmission microscope (STEM) have been built. A single <b>pole-piece</b> miniature one million volt projector lens of only lOcm diameter and weighing 2. lkg was designed, built and tested at 1 million volts in a commercial electron microscope. iii.

40|$|A {{separated}} <b>pole-piece</b> type ferrite magnet motor (FMM) {{is a novel}} type {{of motor}} that can maximize reluctance torque and reduce leakage flux by separating the pole pieces and the web. However, when this type of motor has a short stack length and a large area of pole pieces, the leakage flux in the axial direction has significant influence on the motor&# 39;s performance. A rotor overhang structure {{is one of the}} most crucial design parameters that compensate for the side effects of leakage flux. A conventional overhang structure increases magnetic torque but raises the level of induced voltage. This limits the operation speed range. To overcome such problems, this paper presents a novel multilevel overhang structure.

50|$|Alternators {{have several}} {{advantages}} over direct-current generators. They are lighter, cheaper and more rugged.

40|$|A new pole {{configuration}} for multi-pole homopolar bearings {{proposed in}} this invention reduces rotational losses caused by eddy-currents generated when non-uniform flux distributions exist along the rotor surfaces. The new homopolar magnetic bearing includes a stator with reduced pole-to-pole and exhibits {{a much more}} uniform rotor flux than with large pole-to-pole gaps. A pole feature called a pole-link is incorporated into the low-loss poles to provide a uniform pole-to-pole gap and a controlled path for pole-to-pole flux. In order to implement the low-loss pole configuration of magnetic bearings with small pole-to-pole gaps, a new stator configuration was developed to facilitate installation of coil windings. The stator was divided into sector shaped pieces, as many pieces as there are poles. Each sector-shaped <b>pole-piece</b> can be wound on a standard coil winding machine, and it is practical to wind precision layer wound coils.

40|$|The {{last decade}} {{witnessed}} the rapid {{development and implementation}} of aberration correction in electron optics, realizing a more-than- 70 -year-old dream of aberration-free electron microscopy with a spatial resolution below one angstrom [1 - 9]. With sophisticated aberration correctors, modern electron microscopes now can reveal local structural information unavailable with neutrons and x-rays, such as the local arrangement of atoms, order/disorder, electronic inhomogeneity, bonding states, spin configuration, quantum confinement, and symmetry breaking [10 - 17]. Aberration correction through multipole-based correctors, as well as the associated improved stability in accelerating voltage, lens supplies, and goniometers in electron microscopes now enables medium-voltage (200 - 300 kV) microscopes to achieve image resolution at or below 0. 1 nm. Aberration correction not only improves the instrument's spatial resolution but, equally importantly, allows larger objective lens <b>pole-piece</b> gaps to be employed thus realizing the potential of the instrument as a nanoscale property-measurement tool. That is, while retaining high spatial resolution, we can use various sample stages to observe the materials response under various temperature, electric- and magnetic- fields, and atmospheric environments. Such capabilities afford tremendous opportunities to tackle challenging science and technology issues in physics, chemistry, materials science, and biology. The research goal of the electron microscopy group at the Dept. of Condensed Matter Physics and Materials Science and the Center for Functional Nanomaterials, as well as the Institute for Advanced Electron Microscopy, Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), is to elucidate the microscopic origin of the physical- and chemical-behavior of materials, and the role of individual, or groups of atoms, especially in their native functional environments. We plan to accomplish this by developing and implementing various quantitative electron microscopy techniques in strongly correlated electron systems and nanostructured materials. As a first step, with the support of Materials Science Division, Office of Basic Energy Science, US Department of Energy, and the New York State Office of Science, Technology, and Academic Research, recently we acquired three aberration-corrected electron microscopes from the three major microscope manufacturers, i. e., JEOL, Hitachi, and FEI. The Hitachi HD 2700 C is equipped with a probe corrector, the FEI Titan 80 - 300 has an imaging corrector, while the JEOL 2200 MCO has both. All the correctors are of the dual-hexapole type, designed and manufactured by CEOS GmbH based on the design due to Rose and Haider [3, 18]. All these three are one-of-a-kind in the US, designed for specialized capabilities in characterizing nanoscale structure. In this chapter, we review the performance of these state-of-the art instruments and the new challenges associated with the improved spatial resolution, including the environment requirements of the laboratory that hosts these instruments. Although each instrument we describe here has its own strengths and drawbacks, it is not our intention to rank them in terms of their performance, especially their spatial resolution in imaging...|$|E
