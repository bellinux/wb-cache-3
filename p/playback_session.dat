Surprisingly, eavesdropping is not yet considered as an important factor used to resolve conflicts between family members. In this study, we show that nestling barn owls (Tyto alba) competing for food eavesdrop on nestmates' vocal interactions to assess the dominance status and food needs of opponents. During a first training <b>playback</b> <b>session,</b> we broadcasted to singleton bystander nestlings a simulated vocal interaction between 2 prerecorded individuals, 1 relatively old (i. e., senior) and 1 younger nestling (i. e., junior). One playback individual, the "responder,” called systematically just after the "initiator” playback individual, hence displaying a higher hunger level. To test whether nestlings have eavesdropped on this interaction, we broadcasted the same prerecorded individuals separately in a subsequent playback test session. Nestlings vocalized more rapidly after former initiators' than responders' calls and they produced more calls when the broadcasted individual was formerly a junior initiator. They chiefly challenged vocally juniors and initiators against whom the likelihood of winning a vocal contest is higher. Owlets, therefore, identified the age hierarchy between 2 competitors based on their vocalizations. They also memorized the dynamics of competitors' previous vocal interactions, and used this information to optimally adjust signaling level once interacting with only 1 of the competitor. We conclude that siblings eavesdrop on one another to resolve conflicts over parental resource...|$|E
40|$|Video {{streaming}} {{over the}} Internet has gained tremendous popularity over {{recent years and}} currently constitutes the majority of Internet traffic. The on-demand delivery of high quality video streaming has been enabled {{by a combination of}} consistent improvements in residential download speeds, HTTP-based Adaptive Streaming (HAS), extensive content caching, and the use of Content Distribution Networks (CDNs). However, as large-scale on-demand streaming is gaining popularity, several important questions and challenges remain unanswered, including determining how the infrastructure can best be leveraged to provide users with the best possible playback experience. In addition, it is important to develop new techniques and protocols that facilitate the next generation of streaming applications. Innovative services such as interactive branched streaming are gaining popularity and are expected to be the next big thing in on-demand entertainment. The major contributions of this thesis are in the area of efficient content delivery of video streams using HAS. To address the two challenges above, the work utilizes a combination of different methods and tools, ranging from real-world measurements, characterization of system performance, proof-of-concept implementations, protocol optimization, and evaluation under realistic environments. First, through careful experiments, we evaluate the performance impact and interaction of HAS clients with proxy caches. Having studied the typical interactions between HAS clients and caches, we then design and evaluate content-aware policies to be used by the proxy caches, which parse the client requests and prefetch the chunks that {{are most likely to be}} requested next. In addition, we also design cooperative policies in which clients and proxies share information about the <b>playback</b> <b>session.</b> Our evaluations reveal that, in general, the bottleneck location and network conditions play central roles in which policy choices are most advantageous, and the location of the bottlenecks significantly impact the relative performance differences between policy classes. We also show that careful design and policy selection is important when trying to enhance HAS performance using proxy assistance. Second, this thesis proposes, models, designs, and evaluates novel streaming applications such as interactive branched videos. In such videos, users can influence the content that is being shown to them. We design and evaluate careful prefetching policies that provides seamless playback even when the users defer their path choices to the last possible moment. We derive optimized prefetching policies using an optimization framework, design and implement effective buffer management techniques for seamless playback at branch points, and use parallel TCP connections to achieve efficient buffer workahead. Through performance evaluations, we show that our policies can effectively prefetch data of carefully adapted qualities along multiple alternative paths so to ensure seamless playback, offering users a pleasant viewing experience without playback interruptions.

In particular, {{this study examines}} how strategies that NSs and NNSs employ to interactionally accommodate are related to language proficiency, successful team outcomes, and {{to the construction of}} team hierarchy. The context of the study is the team meeting associated with a design course in the department of electrical and computer engineering (ECE) at an American university, a setting in which NSs and NNSs work together on teams throughout the year to design operable electronic devices. Data was collected during one year from seven teams and a total of 27 participants through participant observation, video and audio taping of team meetings, and participant <b>playback</b> <b>sessions.</b> Data analysis incorporated an integrated approach informed by a variety of discourse analytic approaches. Findings demonstrate that the ability of teammates to interactionally accommodate to each other is correlated with the team's success. However, NSs and NNSs tend to employ strategies with different frequencies and in qualitatively distinct ways. These differences become important to the development of team hierarchy because strategies that NSs and NNSs employ tend to allow NSs control over the interpretive frame, which contributes to the construction of NSs as higher status team members than NNSs. The ability to control the interpretive frame is related to language proficiency, but in some cases NNSs develop strategies that allow them to control the interpretive frame and gain high status...|$|R
40|$|The dear enemy effect {{arises when}} {{territorial}} animals respond more intensely to unfamiliar strangers than to familiar neighbours. This widespread behavioural phenomenon occurs because strangers represent {{a threat to}} both an animal 2 ̆ 7 s territory and parentage, whereas neighbours represent a threat only to parentage. Recent research in birds demonstrates some flexibility in the dear enemy effect across the breeding season. Given that neighbours often sire extrapair young, male animals may benefit by responding more aggressively to neighbours during periods of female fertility. Here we investigate {{the hypothesis that the}} dear enemy effect varies with female fertility by testing the prediction that male birds will respond more strongly to neighbours when their own mates are fertile than when they are not fertile. We conducted a playback experiment with wild song sparrows, Melospiza melodia, repeating <b>playback</b> <b>sessions</b> to paired territorial males {{over the course of a}} breeding season, including periods when females were fertile and periods when they were not. Male song sparrows displayed a dear enemy effect only when their social mate was not fertile. We conclude that male song sparrows adjust behaviour towards neighbours based on their own mate 2 ̆ 7 s fertility status, presumably because neighbours threaten a territorial male 2 ̆ 7 s parentage during his breeding partner 2 ̆ 7 s fertile period. When paternity is not at stake, reduced aggression towards neighbours may enhance fitness, but when paternity is at stake, normal levels of aggression towards neighbours may be favoured as a mate-guarding tactic. © 201...|$|R

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the University of Luton in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of PhilosophyThis dissertation sets out to investigate the management of relationships in British-Chinese business settings. Whilst set in the frameworks of politeness theory and accommodation theory, this dissertation studies the management of relationships in British-Chinese business interactions from a more comprehensive perspective. It examines the sociocultural {{as well as the}} communicative behaviour of the interactions between British and Chinese business people, to explore how relationship issues were handled and how communicative as well as cultural/sociocultural strategies affected the management of relationships. This work is based primarily on research conducted in Britain during November-December 1996, June 1997, and November 1997, when three Chinese delegations were visiting a local engineering company in the southeast of England. For the purpose of this study, three kinds of data were collected: 1) video recordings of authentic meetings between British business people and their Chinese clients (including training sessions); 2) comments from subsequent interviews and <b>playback</b> <b>sessions</b> held with the British and Chinese participants; 3) field notes. This study has shown that a variety of aspects can be held accountable for the management of relationships in intercultural settings. On a macro level, linguistic features alone can not adequately explain the process of negotiating relationships in fonnal intercultural settings, it also involves the non-linguistic perspective. From a linguistic perspective, attending to face needs is not the sole agent for relational management. Accommodation and respect for sociality rights also play an important part in it. The thesis attempts to distinguish the self-claimed face (self-image) and the perceived face (public self-image) and explore their respective functions in the management ofrelationships. The research also claims that group face is more likely to surface in group-versus-group. individual (group identity marked) -versus-group, or individual (group identity marked) -versus-individual (group identity marked or unmarked) settings. This study also argues that communication accommodation theory should incorporate convergence, maintenance or divergence along the line of culture specific behaviour. It proposes a new conceptualisation of CAT that should involve both speech and non-speech accommodative features. This study shows that a wider range of perspectives are needed in order to investigate intercultural communication...|$|R
40|$|The wolf {{recovery}} in France {{dates back to}} 1992, following the natural range expansion of the remaining Italian population since the late 1960 ’s. Facing {{a high level of}} interactions between wolves and sheep breeding, decision makers had to quickly balance the need for managing livestock depredations with the conservation of wolves as a protected species. The French authorities therefore required a reliable assessment of changes in the species range and population numbers, as well as a reliable monitoring of depredations on livestock, all being key variables to be further included within the governmental decision making process. Because of their elusive behaviour, high mobility, and territoriality, applying a standard random sampling design to the monitoring of awolf population would lead to almost no chance of collecting any signs of presence. In order to increase detectability, we use a dual frame survey based on two spatial scales (“population range” and “reproductive unit”) investigated sequentially thanks to a network of specifically-trained wolf experts distributed over 80000 km 2 to collect the data. First, an extensive sign survey at a large scale provides so-called cross-sectional data (pool of signs from unknown individuals for a given year), thereby allowing the detection of new wolf occurrences, new pack formations, and the documentation of geographical trends. Secondly, an intensive sign survey within each detected wolf territory, based on standard snow tracking and wolf howling <b>playback</b> <b>sessions,</b> provides some yearly updatable proxies of the demographic pattern. The combination with a non invasive molecular tracking provides longitudinal data to develop mark-recapture models and estimate vital rates, population size and growth rate, while accounting for detection probabilities. The latter are used in turn to control for proxies’ reliability and to implement demographic models with local population parameters. Finally, wolf activity patterns in connection with predator-prey dynamics is investigated through a pilot study carried out with both wolves and four ungulate preys radio-collared. A particular attention is paid to checking the reliability of presence sign data, as well as improving the cost-efficiency ratio of the monitoring. Finally, these results are also used by the government as one of the components in the decision making process related to the management of coexistence with wolve...|$|R

40|$|Live and on-demand video {{streaming}} {{has emerged as}} the most popular application for the Internet. One reason for this success is the pragmatic decision to use HTTP to deliver video content. However, while all web servers are capable of servicing HTTP streaming video workloads, web servers were not originally designed or optimized for video workloads. Web server research has concentrated on requests for small items that exhibit high locality, while video files are much larger and have a popularity distribution with a long tail of less popular content. Given the large number of servers needed to service millions of streaming video clients, there are large potential benefits from even small improvements in servicing HTTP streaming video workloads. To investigate how web server implementations can be improved, we require a benchmark to analyze existing web servers and test alternate implementations, but no such HTTP streaming video benchmark exists. One reason for the lack of a benchmark is that video delivery is undergoing rapid evolution, so we devise a flexible methodology and tools for creating benchmarks that can be readily adapted to changes in HTTP {{video streaming}} methods. Using our methodology, we characterize YouTube traffic from early 2011 using several published studies and implement a benchmark to replicate this workload. We then demonstrate that three different widely-used web servers (Apache, nginx and the userver) are all poorly suited to servicing streaming video workloads. We modify the userver to use asynchronous serialized aggressive prefetching (ASAP). Aggressive prefetching uses a single large disk access to service multiple small sequential requests, and serialization prevents the kernel from interleaving disk accesses, which together greatly increase throughput. Using the modified userver, we show that characteristics of the workload and server affect the best prefetch size to use and we provide an algorithm that automatically finds a good prefetch size for a variety of workloads and server configurations. We conduct our own characterization of an HTTP streaming video workload, using server logs obtained from Netflix. We study this workload because, in 2015, Netflix alone accounted for 37 % of peak period North American Internet traffic. Netflix clients employ DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP) to switch between different bit rates based on changes in network and server conditions. We introduce the notion of chains of sequential requests to represent the spatial locality of workloads and find that even with DASH clients, the majority of bytes are requested sequentially. We characterize rate adaptation by separating sessions into transient, stable and inactive phases, each with distinct patterns of requests. We find that <b>playback</b> <b>sessions</b> are surprisingly stable; in aggregate, 5 % of total session duration is spent in transient phases, 79 % in stable and 16 % in inactive phases. Finally we evaluate prefetch algorithms that exploit knowledge about workload characteristics by simulating the servicing of the Netflix workload. We show that the workload can be serviced with either 13 % lower hard drive utilization or 48 % less system memory than a prefetch algorithm that makes no use of workload characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{identifies}} the current difficulties {{faced by the}} IT professionals working for collaborative enterprises and explains how we exploit and extend the so-called stateless client systems to support those individuals in cooperative work. Stateless client systems are the software tools that separate the display interface from the application logic in windowing systems. They embed a client/server architecture, where the server executes all applications and the client simply presents the frame buffers or screen images to the user and accepts user input. Since the entire system state is preserved in the server, the client becomes stateless. By providing these stateless clients with suitable coordination mechanism, we enable geographically separated users to share workspaces and applications in a work session. And by recording the messages flowing between the client and the server, we enable temporally separated users to search for and <b>playback</b> previous work <b>sessions</b> to share knowledge and experience. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the mStar environment, which creates an environment for truly scalable distributed teamwork It {{can be and}} is being used {{on a daily basis}} for electronic meetings, distributed electronic education and daily work It creates a new teamwork environment which allows users to collaborate even if they are not present at the same physical location. The mStar environment includes: the multicast WhiteBoard - mWB, which allows for collaborative reviewing of text and images; mChat, which allows for text based group chat; mVote, which allows for distributed voting and mWeb for shared WWW objects. These are all desktop and IP-multicast based and symmetric. The mStar environment also includes mMOD, which is a VCR-like tool for recording and <b>playback</b> of teamwork <b>sessions,</b> and mTunnel, which is an application for handling IP-multicast traffic on narrow links in the network (such as ISDN/modem) and network segments that does not support IP multicast. It allows for scaling and transforming of the network based data in various ways. Godkänd; 1997; 20070131 (ysko...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the multicast Media-onDemand system, mMOD, {{which is an}} on-demand system designed for recording and playback of not only audio and video but also other media that are being multicast on the Internet/MBone today. The system allows for users to request <b>playback</b> of recorded <b>sessions</b> containing MBone audio, video, whiteboard, NetText, mWeb (a distributed HTML presentation system) or any other UDP-multicast distributed session. It also allows for random access within these recordings. The system include a Web-interface for starting and controlling running sessions. To compensate for jitter and out-of-order packets, sessions distributed in RTPformat (RFC 1889), can be reconstructed with new time-stamps. 1 Introduction A video-on-demand system (VOD) {{is a system that}} serves a number of clients with audio and video on their request, and that are usually limited to these two media. Normally one channel is allocated per request and receiver and this leads to resources being ti [...] ...|$|R
