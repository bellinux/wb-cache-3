5|$|The {{economic}} {{importance of}} <b>pipeline</b> <b>transport</b> – {{responsible for a}} high percentage of oil and natural gas transportation – is often undermined by the general public {{due to the lack of}} visibility of this mode. Generally held to be safer and more economical and reliable than the other modes of transport, this mode has many advantages over rival modes, such as trucks and railways. Examples of modern <b>pipeline</b> <b>transport</b> include Alashankou-Dushanzi Crude Oil Pipeline and Iran-Armenia Natural Gas Pipeline. International <b>pipeline</b> <b>transport</b> projects, like the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, presently connect modern nation states– in this case, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey– through pipeline networks.|$|E
5|$|In modern times, {{commercial}} activity {{shifted from the}} major trade routes of the Old World to newer routes between modern nation-states. This activity was sometimes carried out without traditional protection of trade and under international free-trade agreements, which allowed commercial goods to cross borders with relaxed restrictions. Innovative transportation of modern times includes <b>pipeline</b> <b>transport</b> and the relatively well-known trade involving rail routes, automobiles, and cargo airlines.|$|E

5|$|Standard Oil {{moved its}} {{headquarters}} to New York City at 26 Broadway, and Rockefeller became {{a central figure}} in the city's business community. He bought a residence in 1884 on 54th Street near the mansions of other magnates such as William Henry Vanderbilt. Despite personal threats and constant pleas for charity, Rockefeller took the new elevated train to his downtown office daily. In 1887, Congress created the Interstate Commerce Commission which was tasked with enforcing equal rates for all railroad freight, but by then Standard depended more on <b>pipeline</b> <b>transport.</b> More threatening to Standard's power was the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, originally used to control unions, but later central to {{the breakup of the}} Standard Oil trust. Ohio was especially vigorous in applying its state anti-trust laws, and finally forced a separation of Standard Oil of Ohio {{from the rest of the}} company in 1892, the first step in the dissolution of the trust.|$|E

25|$|As more {{pipelines}} are built, {{oil companies}} profits and investments into these companies continue to increase. A decrease in material costs outweighs the net increase in cost of construction. The increase in construction costs results largely from increased labor and permitting costs. Supporters of <b>pipeline</b> <b>transport</b> cite {{the potential for}} job creation, with the greatest being in construction. Estimates for job growth vary, and some {{are found to be}} exaggerated. Little evidence has also been found to support the idea that oil prices will either stabilize or decrease once pipelines are constructed.|$|E
25|$|Pipelines are an {{economical}} way {{to transport}} {{large volumes of}} petroleum products. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration within the U.S. Department of Transportation is responsible for enforcing <b>pipeline</b> <b>transport</b> regulations at the federal level. Regulations cover the hazardous materials transported {{as well as the}} safety of the pipeline itself. A series of pipeline safety acts have been passed over the years including the Pipeline Safety Improvement act of 2002; The Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011; and the Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety (PIPES) Act of 2016. Individual states have varying regulations for the transport of oil into and out of state boundaries, which limits where pipelines can be built.|$|E
25|$|Critics of <b>pipeline</b> <b>transport</b> of oil cite {{environmental}} and land rights issues. Protests over the Keystone XL Pipeline beginning in 2011 and Dakota Access Pipeline have expressed these same concerns. Native peoples {{have been active}} protesters. The Standing Rock Sioux of South Dakota opposed the construction plans of the Dakota Access Pipeline because it ran through a symbolically significant area, and expressed concern that it could compromise their source of drinking water. Since pipelines have been built, multiple pipeline accidents have occurred, resulting in oil spills and the contamination of the surrounding environment. The tribe was also not involved in planning the route for the pipeline. These protests also reflect the ongoing struggle for Native American recognition in the United States. In November 2015 President Barack Obama called to stop construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline. In December 2016 the Army Corps of Engineers prevented further construction on the pipeline near the Standing Rock Reservation. On January 24, 2017 President Donald Trump signed an executive order permitting the completion of both the Keystone XL Pipeline and Dakota Access Pipeline. On March 24, 2017 the permit was granted.|$|E

500|$|There {{were great}} {{innovations}} in metallurgy. In addition to Zhou-dynasty China's (c. 1050 BCE– 256 BCE) previous inventions {{of the blast}} furnace and cupola furnace to make [...] pig iron and cast iron, respectively, the Han period saw the development of steel and wrought iron by use of the finery forge and puddling process. With the drilling of deep boreholes into the earth, the Chinese used not only derricks to lift brine {{up to the surface}} to be boiled into salt, but also set up bamboo-crafted <b>pipeline</b> <b>transport</b> systems which brought natural gas as fuel to the furnaces. Smelting techniques were enhanced with inventions such as the waterwheel-powered bellows; the resulting widespread distribution of iron tools facilitated the growth of agriculture. For tilling the soil and planting straight rows of crops, the improved heavy-moldboard plough with three iron plowshares and sturdy multiple-tube iron seed drill were invented in the Han, which greatly enhanced production yields and thus sustained population growth. The method of supplying irrigation ditches with water was improved with the invention of the mechanical chain pump powered by the rotation of a waterwheel or draft animals, which could transport irrigation water up elevated terrains. The waterwheel was also used for operating trip hammers in pounding grain and in rotating the metal rings of the mechanical-driven astronomical armillary sphere representing the celestial sphere around the Earth.|$|E

The optimal designing of such pipelines is of commercial interests for their widespread acceptance. A methodology has been evolved for the optimal sizing of a <b>pipeline</b> <b>transporting</b> solid-liquid mixture. Least cost principle has been used in sizing such pipelines, which involves the determination of pipe diameter corresponding to the minimum cost for given solid throughput.

Ancient Han Chinese astronomers were also among the first peoples to record observations of a cosmic supernova.

Preliminary results show that gaseous CO 2 transport is cost effective for relatively small mass flows and short (trunk) pipelines. For instance, for a <b>pipeline</b> <b>transporting</b> 5 Mt/y over 100 km of agricultural terrain, gaseous transport would cost 10. 2 €/t and liquid transport 12. 1 €/t (including initial compression).
