5|$|On {{the fourth}} orbit, {{drifting}} in an inverted spacecraft with the Earth 'above' him, Schirra continued his photography and attempted—unsuccessfully—to spot the Echo 1 satellite while passing over East Africa. As he approached California, he spoke briefly to John Glenn in a two-minute conversation broadcast live across the United States {{on radio and}} television. Problems began to recur with the <b>pressure</b> <b>suit,</b> with water condensing on the faceplate; Schirra, concerned about the internal temperature, avoided opening the visor to clean it for fear that the suit temperature would misbehave again.|$|E
5|$|Operational {{problems}} have been experienced and some have caused fleet-wide groundings. Critically, pilots have experienced a decreased mental status, including losing consciousness. There were reports of instances of pilots {{found to have a}} decreased level of alertness or memory loss after landing. F-22 pilots have experienced lingering respiratory problems and a chronic cough; other symptoms include irritability, emotional lability and neurological changes. A number of possible causes were investigated, including possible exposure to noxious chemical agents from the respiratory tubing, <b>pressure</b> <b>suit</b> malfunction, side effects from oxygen delivery at greater-than-atmospheric concentrations, and oxygen supply disruptions. Other problems include minor mechanical problems and navigational software failures. The fleet was grounded for four months in 2011 before resuming flight, but reports of oxygen issues persisted.|$|E
5|$|Watney {{begins the}} 90-sol journey to Schiaparelli and the pre-positioned Ares IV MAV. To {{rendezvous}} with Hermes, Watney removes many components from the MAV, including the nose cone, to lighten it, {{replacing it with}} a piece of the Hab's canvas. As the MAV fails to reach the required speed and altitude, Lewis is forced to use maneuvering thrusters to change course and explosive decompression of Hermess internal atmosphere to reduce speed. When even that is not enough, Commander Lewis uses a Manned Maneuvering Unit, but still cannot reach Watney. Watney pierces the glove of his <b>pressure</b> <b>suit</b> and uses the escaping air to propel himself towards Lewis, effectively rescuing him after being alone for 560 Sols on Mars.|$|E

5|$|Planning began for {{the third}} U.S. orbital mission in February 1962, aiming for a six-or-seven-orbit flight {{to build on the}} {{previous}} three-orbit missions. NASA officially announced the mission on June 27, and the flight plan was finalized in late July. The mission focused on engineering tests rather than on scientific experimentation. The mission finally launched on the morning of October 3, having been delayed two weeks because of problems with the Atlas booster. A series of minor booster problems during launch and a faulty temperature controller in Schirra's <b>pressure</b> <b>suit</b> were the only technical problems noted during the flight. The spacecraft orbited in both automated and passive flight modes for prolonged periods while the pilot monitored it and carried out some minor scientific experiments. After six orbits, the capsule landed in the Pacific Ocean half a mile from the recovery carrier, and was hoisted aboard for Schirra to disembark.|$|E
25|$|The next day, Grissom's {{crew were}} {{conducting}} a launch-pad test for their planned February 21 mission, which they named Apollo 1, when a {{fire broke out}} in the cabin, killing all three men and putting an 18-month hold on the manned program while the block II Command Module (CM) and A7L <b>pressure</b> <b>suit</b> were redesigned for safety.|$|E

25|$|In {{support of}} the ambition, {{considerable}} research {{was carried out by}} both the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) and National Physical Laboratory for the purpose of establishing the most efficient design for the aircraft, as well as to develop a reliable <b>pressure</b> <b>suit</b> to be worn by the pilot. Sir Robert Davis of Siebe Gorman and Professor J.S. Haldane were instrumental in developing the helmet. During tests, the pressure was reduced to the equivalent of being at an altitude of 8o,oooft.|$|E

25|$|In 1935, {{now with}} the rank of Squadron Leader, Swain became a test pilot in the {{experimental}} section at the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) where {{he was involved in}} high-altitude experiments. Departing from Farnborough, Hampshire at 07:30 on 28 September 1936, Swain achieved the world altitude record with a height of 49,967ft in a modified Bristol Type 138A. During his descent, his <b>pressure</b> <b>suit</b> failed causing him to lose visibility through his visor and find it difficult to breathe. He was forced to cut his visor open with his knife in order to maintain consciousness, eventually landing safely at Netheravon, Wiltshire at 10:30.|$|E
25|$|The {{incident}} {{resulted in}} the first fatality on a spacecraft in flight since the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003. The survival of pilot Peter Siebold also {{marks the first time}} in history that anyone has survived the destruction of a spacecraft during a flight when others on board have died. Investigators are trying to determine how Siebold managed to get out of the rocket plane and parachute to the ground from an altitude of roughly 50,000 feet, an altitude virtually devoid of oxygen. On November 7, Siebold told investigators that the aircraft broke up around him. He was still strapped into his seat. He released the straps and his parachute later deployed automatically. Siebold was not wearing a <b>pressure</b> <b>suit</b> during the flight.|$|E
25|$|After this flight, further {{development}} work {{resulted in a}} number of small modifications to the aircraft, the typical objective of these being weight savings and improving the performance of the supercharger. In this mildly revised form, the Type 138A conducted six further flights, during which a maximum altitude of around 50,000ft (15,240m). During this period, Italy had been able to recapture the record, achieving a recorded maximum altitude of 51,364ft (15,656m). In response, on 30 June 1937, Flight Lieutenant M.J. Adam undertook a 2¼-hour flight in which he achieved a record altitude, later certified as 53,937ft (16,440m). Despite the canopy cockpit suffering a major crack during this pioneering flight, Adam was protected from injury by his <b>pressure</b> <b>suit</b> and helmet.|$|E

25|$|Pressure suits: {{these were}} pioneered by Wiley Post in his Lockheed Vega 5b from September 1934 onwards. He was able {{ultimately}} to sustain flights of several hours at over 15,000m (49,000ft). Others used <b>pressure</b> <b>suits</b> to set records with {{up and down}} flights, like F.R. Swain (15,230m or 49,970ft) in the Bristol 138 in September 1936 and Mario Pezzi (17,083m or 56,047ft) in a Caproni Ca.161bis in October 1938. Post's work showed sustained high-altitude flight was possible, but <b>pressure</b> <b>suits</b> were uncomfortable and restrictive.|$|R
25|$|A unique {{supersonic}} {{escape capsule}} {{was designed for}} the XF-103. The pilot's seat was located in a shell with a large movable shield in front that was normally slid down into the area {{in front of the}} pilot's legs. In the case of depressurization, the shield would slide {{up in front of the}} pilot, sealing the seat into a pressurized pod. Basic flight instruments inside the capsule allowed the aircraft to be flown back to base, and a window in the front of the shield allowed the periscope system to be used. In an emergency, the entire capsule would be ejected downward, along with a small portion of the aircraft fuselage that provided a stable aerodynamic shape. To enter and exit the aircraft, the ejection module was lowered on rails out of the bottom of the aircraft, allowing the pilot to simply walk into the seat, sit down, and raise the module into the aircraft. The capsule was fully pressurized, allowing the pilot to continue operating the aircraft without a <b>pressure</b> <b>suit</b> when the capsule was locked up.|$|E
25|$|Difficulties were {{addressed}} throughout 1964 and 1965 at Groom Lake with various technical issues. Captive flights showed unforeseen aerodynamic difficulties. By late January 1966, {{more than a}} year after the first captive flight, everything seemed ready. The first D-21 launch was made on 5 March 1966 with a successful flight, with the D-21 flying 120 miles with limited fuel. A second D-12 flight was successful in April 1966 with the drone flying 1,200 miles, reaching Mach 3.3 and 90,000 feet. An accident on 30 July 1966 with a fully fueled D-21, on a planned checkout flight suffered from a non-start of the drone after its separation, causing it to collide with the M-21 launch aircraft. The two crewmen ejected and landed in the ocean 150 miles offshore. One crew member was picked up by a helicopter, but the other, having survived the aircraft breakup and ejection, drowned when sea water entered his <b>pressure</b> <b>suit.</b> Kelly Johnson personally cancelled the entire program, having had serious doubts from the start of the feasibility. A number of D-21s had already been produced, and rather than scrapping the whole effort, Johnson again proposed to the Air Force that they be launched from a B-52H bomber.|$|E
25|$|Biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) is {{the highest}} level of {{biosafety}} precautions, and is appropriate for work with agents that could easily be aerosol-transmitted within the laboratory and cause severe to fatal disease in humans for which there are no available vaccines or treatments. BSL-4 laboratories are generally set up to be either cabinet laboratories or protective-suit laboratories. In cabinet laboratories, all work must be done within a class III biosafety cabinet. Materials leaving the cabinet must be decontaminated by passing through an autoclave or a tank of disinfectant. The cabinets themselves are required to have seamless edges to allow for easy cleaning. Additionally the cabinet and all materials within must be free of sharp edges {{in order to reduce the}} risk of damage to the gloves. In a protective-suit laboratory, all work must be done in a class II biosafety cabinet by personnel wearing a positive <b>pressure</b> <b>suit.</b> In order to exit the BSL-4 laboratory, personnel must pass through a chemical shower for decontamination, then a room for removing the positive-pressure suit, followed by a personal shower. Entry into the BSL-4 laboratory is restricted to trained and authorized individuals, and all persons entering and exiting the laboratory must be recorded.|$|E

25|$|Preparations for {{a mission}} started {{a month in}} advance with the {{selection}} of the primary and back-up astronaut; they would practice together for the mission. For three days prior to launch, the astronaut went through a special diet to minimize his need for defecating during the flight. On the morning of the trip he typically ate a steak breakfast. After having sensors applied to his body and being dressed in the <b>pressure</b> <b>suit,</b> he started breathing pure oxygen to prepare him for the atmosphere of the spacecraft. He arrived at the launch pad, took the elevator up the launch tower and entered the spacecraft two hours before launch. Once the astronaut was secured inside, the hatch was bolted, the launch area evacuated and the mobile tower rolled back. After this, the launch vehicle was filled with liquid oxygen. The entire procedure of preparing for launch and launching the spacecraft followed a time table called the countdown. It started a day in advance with a pre-count, in which all systems of the launch vehicle and spacecraft were checked. After that followed a 15-hour hold, during which pyrotechnics were installed. Then came the main countdown which for orbital flights started 6½ hours before launch (T – 390 min), counted backwards to launch (T = 0) and then forward until orbital insertion (T + 5 min).|$|E

In the secondary story, Mongul frees himself of Mother Mercy's vines after being imprisoned in Green Lantern Corps vol. 2, issue #26 (September 2008). Ravenous after his imprisonment, he destroys a space craft belonging to newlyweds Kered and Miri Riam (on their way to their honeymoon) in order to ransack it for food. Kered approaches Mongul to ask him to spare their jet packs and enough food for them to find help. In response, Mongul cracks the face plate of Kered's <b>pressure</b> <b>suit,</b> killing him. After Mongul leaves, Miri drifts in space alone for two days before deciding to kill herself out of grief. Before she is able to complete her suicide, a violet power ring finds her and offers to fill the hole in her heart with violet light. Miri accepts and becomes the first new recruit to the Star Sapphires. Miri quickly finds herself fighting for love as she assists a group of Green Lanterns attempting to apprehend Sinestro Corps member: Kryb. Through their temporary partnership they are able to defeat the yellow ring wielder. Though an argument ensues between Miri and Kyle Rayner (one of the Green Lanterns involved in the incident) over whether Kryb should be sent to Oa or Zamaron for detainment, it's agreed that Miri will escort Kryb back to Zamaron for reconditioning and re-education.|$|E
