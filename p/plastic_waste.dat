5|$|Much {{floating}} plastic trash {{does not}} biodegrade, instead disintegrating {{over time and}} eventually breaking down to the molecular level. Rigid plastics may float for years. In {{the center of the}} Pacific gyre, there is a permanent floating accumulation of mostly <b>plastic</b> <b>waste</b> and there is a similar garbage patch in the Atlantic. Foraging sea birds such as the albatross and petrel may mistake debris for food and accumulate indigestible plastic in their digestive systems. Turtles and whales have been found with plastic bags and fishing line in their stomachs. Microplastics may sink, threatening filter feeders on the seabed.|$|E
5|$|Porpoises {{are very}} {{sensitive}} to anthropogenic disturbances, and are keystone species, which can indicate the overall health of the marine environment. Populations of harbor porpoises in the North and Baltic Seas are under increasing pressure from anthropogenic causes such as offshore construction, ship traffic, fishing, and military exercises. Increasing pollution is a serious problem for marine mammals. Heavy metals and <b>plastic</b> <b>waste</b> are not biodegradable, and sometimes cetaceans consume these hazardous materials, mistaking them for food items. As a result, the animals are more susceptible to diseases and have fewer offspring. Harbour porpoises from the English Channel were found to have accumulated heavy metals.|$|E

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to characterize the chemical and bonding properties of coastal <b>plastics</b> <b>waste.</b> Growing of economic, human activity and industrial procedure are resulting in the increased of the <b>plastics</b> <b>wastes.</b> <b>Plastics</b> <b>waste</b> generates cause major challenge in waste handling because of the varying properties due to degradation. Furthermore, the harmful effect and toxical hazard of plastics is a real threat to the health and environment. In order to study the properties, two method of testing are used. The samples are sorted base on their four types of plastics. The type of plastics that were used in this study was PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride), PS (Polystyrene), PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) and PP (Polypropylene). The samples of plastics that have been sorted then were shred using shredding machine. All the shredded samples were fed into the extrusion machine to get the long-shape of plastics which later pelletized using pelletizing machine. The testing methods involve in this study were TGA (Thermogravimetric) and FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy). The result obtained for FTIR analysis shows the different of bonding between coastal and virgin plastics. Other group of homologous series was found in the bonding of coastal <b>plastics</b> <b>waste.</b> The resulted data for TGA analysis show the higher value of thermal degradation for coastal <b>plastics</b> <b>waste</b> compared to virgin plastics. Sample of PVC, PS PET and PP was degrading at temperature of 357. 77 oC, 384. 25 oC, 397. 97 o C and 362. 61 oC which is much higher than the virgin plastics that degrade at temperature of 333 oC, 330 oC, 265 oC and 315 oC. It can be concluded that the coastal <b>plastics</b> <b>waste</b> differ from the virgin plastics in term of bonding and temperature resistant. It is due to the long exposure to the sun and presence of other minerals on coastal <b>plastics</b> <b>waste.</b> This study shows that the coastal <b>plastics</b> <b>waste</b> have an advantages and unique properties compared to the virgin plastics. This study will provide foundation for future research on desirable method to handle the coastal <b>plastics</b> <b>waste.</b> It will enable for greater research and their potential to be used in technologies of plastics recycling...|$|R

25|$|In principle, {{gasification}} {{can proceed}} from {{just about any}} organic material, including biomass and <b>plastic</b> <b>waste.</b> The resulting syngas can be combusted.

In many gasification processes most of the inorganic components of the input material, such as metals and minerals, are retained in the ash. In some gasification processes (slagging gasification) this ash has the form of a glassy solid with low leaching properties, but the net power production in slagging gasification is low (sometimes negative) and costs are higher.|$|E

40|$|This review aims {{to clarify}} the need of {{decreasing}} the environmental effects caused by human and {{draw attention to the}} increasing environmental effects of <b>plastics</b> <b>wastes.</b> <b>Plastics</b> consist of organic molecules with high density molecules or polymers. Main resources of plastics are the residue of oil rafineries. Several advantages of plastics, have increased the usage continuously. Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) is the most commonly used plastics. PET is used to protect food, drinking water, fruit juice, alcoholic beverage, and food packing films. By the increasing interest on the environmental effects of <b>plastic</b> <b>wastes,</b> concerns on the recyclable packing materials also grew up. Also the daily use of recyclable containers consisting PET have increased. There are five steps for recycling of plastics. These steps are; using large amounts of plastics, collecting them in a big center, classifying and sorting the plastics, reproducing the polymers and obtaining new products with melted plastics. Providing a healthy recycling of plastics, the consumers should have knowledge and responsibility. The consumer should know what he/she has to do before putting the plastics in the recycling containers. Recycling containers and bags should be placed near the sources of <b>plastic</b> <b>wastes.</b> Consequently, the <b>plastic</b> <b>wastes</b> and environmental problems they cause will be on the agenda in future.

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of the work is}} the conversion of <b>waste</b> <b>plastics</b> into fuel oil. <b>Plastic</b> <b>wastes</b> such as, polypropylene, low density polyethylene, high density polyethylene, polystyrene are the most frequently used in everyday activities and disposed of to the environment after service. Plastic are those substances which can take long periods of time to decompose if disposed off simply to the environment. Therefore, <b>waste</b> <b>plastic</b> should be changed into usable resources. The different <b>waste</b> <b>plastics</b> were thermally cracked at different temperature and then it was tried to measure the oil produced, the residue left after the reaction is completed, and the gas produced. Then it is compared that which types of plastics can yield higher amount of oil. There are a number of methods by which <b>plastic</b> <b>wastes</b> can be managed such as incineration, recycling, land filling, and thermal cracking. But this work focuses on thermal cracking of <b>waste</b> <b>plastic</b> to change them into usable resources, because in this method the emission of hazardous gases to the environment insignificant.

40|$|Abstract—A {{high density}} {{polyethylene}} (HDPE) polymer was catalytically degraded using two sulfate modified Zirconium catalysts in a fixed-bed reactor at 400 OC {{with the aim of}} converting <b>plastic</b> <b>wastes</b> to obtain valuable and recyclable liquid products. The TGA results revealed that the onset of degradation was moved from 420 OC for HDPE alone to less than 300 OC {{in the presence of the}} catalysts. The catalysts improved the polymer degradation by achieving high conversion of about 99. 8 %. The two catalysts appeared to promote different product composition. CAT 1 (7 %SO 3) was more selective to higher gaseous products (68 %) and liquid (32 %) of mainly aromatics, whereas CAT 2 (3. 5 %SO 3) promoted high liquid products (about 53 %) of mainly olefinic compounds. It can be concluded that the catalysts can be used for catalytic conversion of <b>plastic</b> <b>wastes</b> to obtain valuable products, most especially CAT 2 (3. 5 %SO 3) which gave high liquid content that is composed of mainly olefinic, naphthenic and paraffinic compounds whose carbon number distribution is within the gasoline range.
