This article {{presents}} the results of verification of existence and nature of relationships between the types of preventive means used and the structure of individual companies from the industrial processing sector. As part of our research work, we identified the level of use of technical means, organisational means and <b>personal</b> <b>protection</b> <b>means</b> in the particular divisions of the industrial processing sector, we determined the structure of individual companies from the particular divisions, and then, using the Tau Kendall correlation coefficient, we also confirmed the existence of relationships between the level of use of technical means and the structure of the analysed individual manufacturing system companies...|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} sanitary-hygienic {{characteristics}} of working conditions, charts with results of sanitary-epidemiologic examination {{performed in a}} zoogenous nidus, outpatient clinic cards and questionnaires filled in by 202 patients living in Omsk region and suffering from occupational brucellosis. The disease usually prevails among stock-breeders, veterinaries and workers employed at meat-processing enterprises. Our goal was to detect risks of occupational, production-induced and general pathology evolvement. Working conditions which all the examined people had to work in corresponded to hazardous (3. 3) or even dangerous (4) category as per occurrence of contacts with infectious agents and parasites (biological risk). Apart from biological factor, a number of workers were under complex exposure to ammonia concentrations (higher than MPC), noise higher than MPL, vibration, cooling microclimate, uncomfortable lighting environment, labor process hardness and intensity. There were several factors causing epidemiologic risks as well. Disinfectants were absent or their quantity was not sufficient; industrial and amenity rooms were not well-organized; there was no central hot water supply or shower rooms, separate rooms for meals, specialized implements for removing abortus and stillborn fetuses and afterbirths, correctly organized burial grounds, or first aid kits. Hygienic health risks were caused by insufficient cleaning agents supply, absence of centralized protecting clothing laundering, and insufficient provision with <b>personal</b> <b>protection</b> <b>means.</b> Occupational health risks resulted from absence of preliminary medical examinations in standard recruitment procedures, irregularity and low quality of periodical medical examinations. Our qualitative assessment of behavioral health risks revealed {{that a lot of}} workers tended to have irresponsible medical and hygienic behavior, there were disorders in their work and rest regime (shift work with shifts rotation), nutrition, sleeping and waking. We also found out that the examined workers didn't pursue self-preserving lifestyle as they drank alcohol, smoked, underestimated the importance of being vaccinated against brucellosis and of having medical examinations, and didn't apply for medical aid in due time. We detected the third type of risk-genous behavior, "high risk-genous level, passive" in 28. 22 % of our respondent...|$|E
40|$|This study {{concerns}} the ethical problems of <b>personal</b> data <b>protection</b> at work. The {{aim of this}} project is {{the analysis of the}} law structures, which determine the range of <b>protection</b> <b>personal</b> data of the employee and the candidate to work and the rights of data collecting and processing by the employer. The employee privacy protection at work is the principle of labour law expressed in Article 11 of the Labour Code. However <b>personal</b> data <b>protection</b> problem is directly regulated by Article 22 of the Labour Code, which entitle employers to demand certain personal data from the employees and the candidates to work. The regulation determine the list of data, which may be the subject of legal actions by employer in the field of collecting and processing of personal data. The most important issue is connected with the treatment of sensitive information, such as health data, drug testing and genetic testing, sex life, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade-union membership. <b>Personal</b> data <b>protection</b> <b>means</b> the necessity of cooperation between the employee and the employer not only in the field determined by the law but on the basis of ethical values as well. Hence the employer’s obligation to keep from actions which directly interfere in employee’s protected personal effects. But the employee is obliged to give true information about himself in order to protect his health and life at work...|$|R

40|$|Noise {{is usually}} defined either {{unwanted}} sound or sound that is {{harmful to the}} hearing. Earlier {{studies have shown that}} musicians are exposed to sound levels that can be harmful to hearing, and thus music can be considered as noise. Studies have also shown that musicians have hearing problems due to prolonged music exposure. This is also the case among classical musicians. According to the new noise directive, hearing conservation programs directed to entertainment sector are needed. However the needs and attitudes of the classical music players are not understood in many perspectives. In this study, the total annual noise exposure including personal rehearsals has been measured and evaluated for the first time. The problems experienced with hearing protective devices, hearing symptoms (self-evaluated hearing loss, tinnitus, hyperacusis and diplacusis), and stress and their interaction were identified and quantified in two countries among large symphony orchestras. The results showed that the use of a hearing protective device was poor, especially in personal rehearsals. The musicians with hearing loss used more often a hearing protective device. All hearing symptoms were related to stress and reduced work satisfaction. Hearing loss was measured with audiometer among a volunteer group. The hearing loss correlated with music exposure but was smaller than predicted by the standard ISO 1999 - 1990. Room acoustics was improved in a project involving small classrooms for music students. The classrooms correspond to personal rehearsal facilities for musicians. The improvement in room acoustics was minor, but had a beneficial effect on job satisfaction. The thesis provides <b>means</b> to implement <b>personal</b> <b>protection,</b> technical <b>means</b> and training in hearing conservation programs for classical music players...|$|R

40|$|Characteristic {{features}} of firefighters’ rescue work are risks {{for their lives}} because of possible explosions and collapses, danger of injuries, limited visual range or complete absence of visibility, high temperature and high humidity. Extinguishing fires in different weather conditions, the firefighters can be influenced by abrupt and repeated changes in ambient temperature. Close to the seat of fire the rescuer is exposed to powerful thermal radiation that makes it necessary to use <b>personal</b> individual thermal <b>protection</b> <b>means.</b> Fire units in Ukraine are equipped with heat-reflective and thermal protective suits, that have become outdated, with rather limited protective service life and don't ensure safety of firefighters during extinguishing fires and rescue operations under high temperature conditions. The drawbacks of these existing protective suits reduce {{the efficiency of the}} firefighters’ rescue work. That is why the improvement of individual thermal <b>protection</b> <b>means</b> will make it possible to increase the efficiency of work within the areas of high temperatures. The purpose of the work is to identify ways of upgrading the safety and tactical possibilities of emergency rescue operations under high temperature conditions. The article analyzes the working conditions of the rescuers, various types of thermal protection structural features and applying autonomic cooling elements, defines limiting values of heat flows and ambient air temperature. The surface layers of the protective clothing are of time and temperature limited utility. Analysis showed that the existing <b>means</b> of thermal <b>protection</b> are of limited usefulness and are too massive thus restraining the activities of firefighters. It has been concluded {{that it is possible to}} use water or foam forming composition from fire fighting systems for cooling the body and clothes of the rescuers. Following these recommendations may increase the tactical possibilities of rescue units in extinguishing fires under high temperature condition...|$|R
