40|$|To date, {{most of the}} {{discussion}} regarding how the Constitution protects privacy interests in stored e-mail has focused on whether a warrant is required to conduct stored e-mail surveillance and whether probable cause is the appropriate justification standard. Little to no attention has been directed toward how the <b>particularity</b> requirement of the Fourth Amendment applies to searches and seizures of stored e-mail communications. Only Susan Freiwald has argued that procedural <b>particularity</b> should be required in order for government acquisitions of stored e-mails to pass constitutional muster, yet she did not enumerate specific standards of <b>particularity.</b> This Article addresses how the <b>particularity</b> requirement applies to stored email surveillance and sets forth standards to evaluate the <b>particularity</b> of search warrants for stored e-mail communications. This Article proceeds in four parts. Part II explains why and how procedural protections derived from the <b>particularity</b> requirement have been codified by Congress and imposed by the courts in order to limit certain electronic-surveillance techniques. Part III describes how probable cause defines which stored e-mails the government may search and seize {{and the reason why}} scholarship has overemphasized probable cause in the context of stored e-mail surveillance. Then described is how current statutory law governing stored e-mail surveillance is in disharmony with the Fourth Amendment, and therefore how it must be amended to require search warrants for stored e-mail surveillance. Part IV proposes concrete standards for determining whether a warrant authorizing a search and seizure of stored e-mail communications adheres to the <b>particularity</b> requirement of the Fourth Amendment. Finally, Part V addresses the practicalities of the proposed <b>particularity</b> standards and responds to several potential objections concerning the implementation of these standards...|$|R

25|$|The book {{offers an}} {{in-depth}} account of Ion Creangă's early life {{in what was}} then the state of Moldavia, with much insight into the social landscape of his childhood universe, describing relationships between its hero, mainly referred to with his hypocorism and patronymic Nică al lui Ștefan a Petrei or Nic-a lui Ștefan a Petrei ("Nică of Ștefan of Petru"), and the various people in his life. It traces Nică's coming of age passage, from an idyllic age spent the remote village of Humulești (now part of Târgu Neamț town) to rebellious adolescence and training for a Romanian Orthodox priesthood in the urban centers of Fălticeni and Iași. The narrative flow is often interrupted by lengthy and characteristic soliloquies, imparting Creangă's worldview and regrets. The text itself is noted for its characteristic use of the Romanian lexis, including its accomplished rendition of Moldavian dialectal <b>particularities.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{relation}} of concepts and cases in Rabinow’s work distinguishes {{itself from the}} more common mode of social science work predicated on using examples to test general theories or philosophical practice that seeks analytic clarity about universals or general (often highly abstract) cases. In contrast, Rabinow argues that work on concepts opens up and orients inquiry into the concrete features of distinctive cases, whereas the use of ostensibly timeless theory or universal concepts {{are unlikely to be}} very helpful in drawing attention to <b>particularities</b> and singularities. Given this goal, such traditional approaches can function as a real impediment to inquiry. Rabinow defines concept work as “constructing, elaborating and testing a conceptual inventory as well as specifying and experimenting with multi-dimensional diagnostic and analytic frames.” In that sense, Rabinow’s work continues with appropriate modifications a social scientific tradition stretching from Max Weber through Clifford Geertz.|$|E
25|$|Kant {{proceeds}} to motivate {{the need for}} the special sort of inquiry he calls a metaphysics of morals: “That there must be such a philosophy is evident from the common idea of duty and of moral laws.” The moral law must “carry with it absolute necessity.” (4:389) The content and the bindingness of the moral law, in other words, do not vary according to the <b>particularities</b> of agents or their circumstances. Given that the moral law, if it exists, is universal and necessary, the only appropriate means to investigate it is through a priori rational reflection. Thus, a correct theoretical understanding of morality requires a metaphysics of morals. Kant thinks that until we have completed this sort of investigation, “morals themselves are liable to all kinds of corruption” because the “guide and supreme norm for correctly estimating them are missing.” A fully specified account of the moral law will guard against the errors and rationalization to which human moral reasoning is prone. (4:390) The search for the supreme principle of morality—the antidote to confusion in the moral sphere—will occupy Kant for the first two chapters of the Groundwork.|$|E

500|$|Andrić {{was raised}} in a country that had changed little since the Ottoman period despite being {{mandated}} to Austria-Hungary at the Congress of Berlin in 1878. Eastern and Western culture intermingled in Bosnia to a far greater extent {{than anywhere else in the}} Balkan peninsula. Having lived there from an early age, Andrić came to cherish Višegrad, calling it [...] "my real home". Though it was a small provincial town (or kasaba), Višegrad proved to be an enduring source of inspiration. It was a multi-ethnic and multi-confessional town, the predominant groups being Serbs and Bosnian Muslims (Bosniaks). From an early age, Andrić closely observed the customs of the local people. These customs, and the <b>particularities</b> of life in eastern Bosnia, would later be detailed in his works. Andrić made his first friends in Višegrad, playing with them along the Drina River and the town's famous Mehmed Paša Sokolović Bridge.|$|E
500|$|There are {{multiple}} ways {{to define the}} concept of [...] "species." [...] The choice of definition {{is dependent on the}} <b>particularities</b> of the species concerned. For example, some species concepts apply more readily toward sexually reproducing organisms while others lend themselves better toward asexual organisms. Despite the diversity of various species concepts, these various concepts can be placed into one of three broad philosophical approaches: interbreeding, ecological and phylogenetic. The Biological Species Concept (BSC) {{is a classic example of}} the interbreeding approach. Defined by Ernst Mayr in 1942, the BSC states that [...] "species are groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations, which are reproductively isolated from other such groups." [...] Despite its wide and long-term use, the BSC like others is not without controversy, for example because these concepts cannot be applied to prokaryotes, and this is called the species problem. Some researchers have attempted a unifying monistic definition of species, while others adopt a pluralistic approach and suggest that there may be different ways to logically interpret the definition of a species.|$|E
500|$|As {{early as}} 1840, Mihail Kogălniceanu was urging writers to seek {{inspiration}} {{for their work}} in Romanian folklore in creating a [...] "cultured literature". In 1855, after the Wallachian revolution was defeated {{and most of its}} leaders went into exile, he noted that the lighter toll Russian intervention had in Moldavia contributed to the preservation of literature; alongside similar statements made by Vasile Alecsandri, this allowed Ibrăileanu to conclude that, after 1848, Moldavia played a bigger part in shaping the cultural landscape of Romania. Writing {{more than half a century}} after the critic, historian Lucian Boia also noted that, while Kogălniceanu stressed national unity, his discourse tended to place emphasis on Moldavian <b>particularities.</b> Also according to Ibrăileanu, Kogălniceanu and Alecu Russo have set the foundation for the local school of literary criticism, and, together, had announced the cultural professionalism advocated by Junimea after the 1860s. The latter conclusion was partly shared by Călinescu, Tudor Vianu and literary researcher Z. Ornea. Nevertheless, in its reaction against the 1848 generation, Junimea, and especially its main figure Titu Maiorescu, tended to ignore or outright dismiss Kogălniceanu's causes and the attitudes he expressed.|$|E

500|$|Andriamasinavalona's {{reorganization}} {{and refinement}} of the subdivisions of the noble class {{took into account}} the precedents set by earlier Merina kings Andrianjaka and Ralambo. He declared that only members of the Zazamarolahy ("Numerous Children") caste, composed of nobles descended from Andrianjaka's children, could be shaded by the red parasol of royalty; {{the tradition of the}} royal parasol was introduced to Imerina during Andriamasinavalona's reign and persisted until the dissolution of the monarchy in 1897. [...] He also decreed that their tombs should be topped with a tranomasina, a small wooden house without windows or hearth and containing their worldly riches, where their spirit could return to visit after death. Unlike other noble subcastes, the Zazamarolahy were not constrained to inhabit a particular neighborhood, as Andriamasinavalona acknowledged the privilege of future sovereigns to determine the proximity of these most influential nobles according to the <b>particularities</b> of changing circumstances. Andriamasinavalona also narrowed the pool of potential future sovereigns by restricting this right to a new sub-group within the Zazamarolahy, which he termed Zanak'andriana ("Children of the Sovereign"). This group comprised all the descendents of the royal wives who had given birth to the king's four designated heirs. New rulers could only be selected from among this new sub-class of nobles.|$|E
500|$|Highlighting Ion Creangă's {{recourse}} to the <b>particularities</b> of Moldavian regionalisms and archaisms, their accumulation making Creangă's work {{very difficult to}} translate, George Călinescu reacted against claims that the narratives reflected antiquating patterns. He concluded that, in effect, Creangă's written language {{was the equivalent of}} a [...] "glossological museum", and even contrasted by the writer's more modern everyday parlance. Also discussing the impression that Creangă's work should be read with a Moldavian accent, noted for its [...] "softness of sound" [...] in relation to standard Romanian phonology, Călinescu cautioned against interpretative exaggerations, maintaining that the actual texts only offer faint suggestions of regional pronunciation. Contrasting Creangă with the traditions of literature produced by Wallachians in what became the standard literary language, Călinescu also argued in favor of a difference in mentality: the [...] "balance" [...] evidenced by Moldavian speech and illustrated in Ion Creangă's writings is contrasted by the [...] "discoloration and roughness" [...] of [...] "Wallachianism". He also criticized those views according to which Creangă's variant of the literary language was [...] "beautiful", since it failed to [...] "please everyone on account of some acoustical beauty", and since readers from outside the writer's native area could confront it [...] "with some irritation." [...] For Călinescu, the result nevertheless displays [...] "an enormous capacity of authentic speech", also found in the works of Caragiale and, in the 20th century, Mihail Sadoveanu. According to the same commentator, the dialectical interventions formed a background to a lively vocabulary, a [...] "hermetic" [...] type of [...] "argot", which contained [...] "hilarious double entendres and indecent onomatopoeia", passing from [...] "erudite beauty" [...] to [...] "obscene laughter". Some of the expressions characteristic of Creangă's style are obscure in meaning, and some other, such as [...] "drought made the snake scream inside the frog's mouth", appear to be spontaneous and nonsensical. Another specific trait of this language, commented upon by Vianu's and compared by him to the aesthetics of Classicism, sees much of Creangă's prose being set to a discreet poetic meter.|$|E
