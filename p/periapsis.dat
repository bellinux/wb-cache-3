5|$|Ganymede {{participates in}} orbital {{resonances}} with Europa and Io: for every orbit of Ganymede, Europa orbits twice and Io orbits four times. The superior conjunction between Io and Europa always occurs when Io is at <b>periapsis</b> and Europa at apoapsis. The superior conjunction between Europa and Ganymede occurs when Europa is at <b>periapsis.</b> The longitudes of the Io–Europa and Europa–Ganymede conjunctions {{change with the}} same rate, making triple conjunctions impossible. Such a complicated resonance is called the Laplace resonance.|$|E
5|$|Neptune's second known {{satellite}} (by {{order of}} discovery), the irregular moon Nereid, {{has one of}} the most eccentric orbits of any satellite in the Solar System. The eccentricity of 0.7512 gives it an apoapsis that is seven times its <b>periapsis</b> distance from Neptune.|$|E
5|$|The {{combined}} {{analysis of}} imaging, mass spectrometry, and magnetospheric data {{suggests that the}} observed south polar plume emanates from pressurized subsurface chambers, similar to Earth's geysers,. The mechanism that drives and sustains the eruptions {{is thought to be}} tidal heating. The intensity of the eruption of the south polar jets varies significantly {{as a function of the}} position of Enceladus in its orbit. The plumes are about four times brighter when Enceladus is at apoapsis (the point in its orbit most distant from Saturn) than when it is at <b>periapsis.</b> This is consistent with geophysical calculations which predict the south polar fissures are under compression near <b>periapsis,</b> pushing them shut, and under tension near apoapsis, pulling them open.|$|E
5|$|Two {{values are}} {{provided}} for {{the dimensions of the}} initial orbit. For telescopes in Earth orbit, the min and max altitude are given in kilometers. For telescopes in solar orbit, the minimum distance (<b>periapsis)</b> and the maximum distance (apoapsis) between the telescope and the center of mass of the sun are given in astronomical units (AU).|$|E
5|$|After the ε ring, the α and β {{rings are}} the {{brightest}} of Uranus's rings. Like the ε ring, they exhibit regular variations in brightness and width. They are brightest and widest 30° from the apoapsis and dimmest and narrowest 30° from the <b>periapsis.</b> The α and β rings have sizable orbital eccentricity and non-negligible inclination. The widths of these rings are 4.8–10km and 6.1–11.4km, respectively. The equivalent optical depths are 3.29km and 2.14km, resulting in normal optical depths of 0.3–0.7 and 0.2–0.35, respectively. During a ring plane-crossing event in 2007 the rings disappeared, {{which means they}} are geometrically thin like the ε ring and devoid of dust. However, the same event revealed a thick and optically thin dust band just outside the β ring, which was also observed earlier by Voyager 2. The masses of the α and β rings {{are estimated to be}} about 5kg (each)—half the mass of the ε ring.|$|E
5|$|Hiʻiaka orbits Haumea nearly circularly every 49days. Namaka orbits Haumea in 18 {{days in a}} {{moderately}} elliptical, non-Keplerian orbit, and as of 2008 was inclined 13° with respect to Hiʻiaka, which perturbs its orbit. Because the impact that created the moons of Haumea {{is thought to have}} occurred in the early history of the Solar System, over the following billions of years it should have been tidally damped into a more circular orbit. Namaka's orbit has likely been disturbed by orbital resonances with the more-massive Hiʻiaka due to converging orbits as they moved outward from Haumea due to tidal dissipation. They may have been caught in and then escaped from orbital resonance several times; they currently are in or at least close to an 8:3 resonance. This resonance strongly perturbs Namaka's orbit, which has a current precession of its argument of <b>periapsis</b> by about −6.5° per year, a precession period of 55 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{inclination}} of {{a planet}} tells how far above or below an established reference plane its orbit lies. In the Solar System, the reference plane is the plane of Earth's orbit, called the ecliptic. For extrasolar planets, the plane, known as the sky plane or plane of the sky, is the plane perpendicular to the observer's line of sight from Earth. The eight planets of the Solar System all lie {{very close to the}} ecliptic; comets and Kuiper belt objects like Pluto are at far more extreme angles to it. The points at which a planet crosses above and below its reference plane are called its ascending and descending nodes. The longitude of the ascending node is the angle between the reference plane's 0 longitude and the planet's ascending node. The argument of <b>periapsis</b> (or perihelion in the Solar System) is the angle between a planet's ascending node and its closest approach to its star.|$|E
25|$|Different sets of {{elements}} {{are used for}} various astronomical bodies. The eccentricity, , and either the semi-major axis, , or the distance of <b>periapsis,</b> , are used to specify the shape and size of an orbit. The angle of the ascending node, , the inclination, , and the argument of <b>periapsis,</b> , or the longitude of <b>periapsis,</b> , specify {{the orientation of the}} orbit in its plane. Either the longitude at epoch, , the mean anomaly at epoch, , or the time of perihelion passage, , are used to specify a known point in the orbit. The choices made depend whether the vernal equinox or the node are used as the primary reference. The semi-major axis is known if the mean motion and the gravitational mass are known.|$|E
25|$|After 100 {{days the}} {{apoapsis}} was lowered to 10,107km and <b>periapsis</b> raised to 298km {{to give an}} orbital period of 6.7 hours.|$|E
25|$|For any orbits {{around a}} center of mass, there are the terms <b>periapsis</b> and {{apoapsis}} (or apapsis). Pericenter and apocenter are equivalent alternatives.|$|E
25|$|The {{angles of}} inclination, {{longitude}} of the ascending node, and argument of <b>periapsis</b> {{can also be}} described as the Euler angles defining the orientation of the orbit relative to the reference coordinate system.|$|E
25|$|From {{the surface}} of Quaoar and {{at a point where}} Weywot is at zenith it would have an angular {{diameter}} of 15.9 arcminutes at apoapsis and 21.4 arcminutes at <b>periapsis,</b> in comparison the Moon's size varies between 29.4 and 33.5 arcminutes. Its apparent magnitude at full phase would be about -3, comparable to Jupiter at maximum brightness.|$|E
25|$|The {{other planets}} {{experience}} perihelion shifts as well, but, {{since they are}} farther from the Sun and have longer periods, their shifts are lower, {{and could not be}} observed accurately until long after Mercury's. For example, the perihelion shift of Earth's orbit due to general relativity is of 3.84″ per century, and Venus's is 8.62″. Both values have now been measured, with results in good agreement with theory. The <b>periapsis</b> shift has also now been measured for binary pulsar systems, with PSR 1913+16 amounting to 4.2º per year. These observations are consistent with general relativity. It is also possible to measure <b>periapsis</b> shift in binary star systems which do not contain ultra-dense stars, but it is more difficult to model the classical effects precisely – for example, the alignment of the stars' spin to their orbital plane needs to be known and is hard to measure directly. A few systems, such as DI Herculis, have been measured as test cases for general relativity.|$|E
25|$|Other orbital {{parameters}} can be computed from the Keplerian {{elements such as}} the period, apoapsis, and <b>periapsis.</b> (When orbiting the Earth, the last two terms are known as the apogee and perigee.) It is common to specify the period instead of the semi-major axis in Keplerian element sets, as each can be computed from the other provided the standard gravitational parameter, , is given for the central body.|$|E
25|$|The Delaunay orbital elements, {{commonly}} referred to as Delaunay variables, are action-angle coordinates consisting of the argument of <b>periapsis,</b> the mean anomaly and the longitude of the ascending node, along with their conjugate momenta. They are used to simplify perturbative calculations in celestial mechanics, for example while investigating the Kozai-Lidov oscillations in hierarchical triple systems. They were introduced by Charles-Eugène Delaunay during his study of the motion of the Moon.|$|E
25|$|First {{evaluation}} of the orbital insertion showed that the orbiter had reached its first milestone at Mars. The orbit was later adjusted by four more main engine firings to the desired 259km × 11,560km near-polar (86 degree inclination) orbit with a period of 7.5 hours. Near <b>periapsis</b> the top deck is pointed down towards the Martian surface and near apoapsis the high gain antenna will be pointed towards Earth for uplink and downlink.|$|E
25|$|Under Newtonian physics, a {{two-body}} system {{consisting of}} a lone object orbiting a spherical mass would trace out an ellipse with the spherical mass at a focus. The point of closest approach, called the <b>periapsis</b> (or, because the central body in the Solar System is the Sun, perihelion), is fixed. A number of effects in the Solar System cause the perihelia of planets to precess (rotate) around the Sun. The principal cause {{is the presence of}} other planets which perturb one another's orbit. Another (much less significant) effect is solar oblateness.|$|E
25|$|A small radial impulse {{given to}} a body in orbit changes the eccentricity, but not the orbital period (to first order). A {{prograde}} or retrograde impulse (i.e. an impulse applied along the orbital motion) changes both the eccentricity and the orbital period. Notably, a prograde impulse at <b>periapsis</b> raises the altitude at apoapsis, and vice versa, and a retrograde impulse does the opposite. A transverse impulse (out of the orbital plane) causes rotation of the orbital plane without changing the period or eccentricity. In all instances, a closed orbit will still intersect the perturbation point.|$|E
25|$|HD 80606, a sun-like star in {{a binary}} system, orbits a common center of gravity with its partner, HD 80607; the two are {{separated}} by 1,200 AU on average. Research conducted in 2003 indicates that its sole planet, HD 80606 b is a future hot Jupiter, modeled to have evolved in a perpendicular orbit around 5 AU from its sun. The 4-Jupiter mass planet is projected to eventually move into a circular, more aligned orbit via the Kozai mechanism. However, it is currently on an incredibly eccentric orbit that ranges from approximately one astronomical unit at its apoapsis and six stellar radii at <b>periapsis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pulsars {{are rapidly}} {{rotating}} neutron stars which emit regular radio pulses as they rotate. As such {{they act as}} clocks which allow very precise monitoring of their orbital motions. Observations of pulsars in orbit around other stars have all demonstrated substantial <b>periapsis</b> precessions that cannot be accounted for classically but can {{be accounted for by}} using general relativity. For example, the Hulse–Taylor binary pulsar PSR B1913+16 (a pair of neutron stars in which one is detected as a pulsar) has an observed precession of over 4 of arc per year (periastron shift per orbit only about 10−6). This precession has been used to compute the masses of the components.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of planets {{orbiting}} a star, {{the mass of the}} star and all its satellites are calculated to be at a single point called the barycenter. The paths of all the star's satellites are elliptical orbits about that barycenter. Each satellite in that system will have its own elliptical orbit with the barycenter at one focal point of that ellipse. At any point along its orbit, any satellite will have a certain value of kinetic and potential energy with respect to the barycenter, and that energy is a constant value at every point along its orbit. As a result, as a planet approaches <b>periapsis,</b> the planet will increase in speed as its potential energy decreases; as a planet approaches apoapsis, its velocity will decrease as its potential energy increases.|$|E
25|$|If {{an orbit}} {{is about a}} {{planetary}} body with significant atmosphere, its orbit can decay because of drag. Particularly at each <b>periapsis,</b> the object experiences atmospheric drag, losing energy. Each time, the orbit grows less eccentric (more circular) because the object loses kinetic energy precisely when that energy is at its maximum. This {{is similar to the}} effect of slowing a pendulum at its lowest point; the highest point of the pendulum's swing becomes lower. With each successive slowing more of the orbit's path is affected by the atmosphere and the effect becomes more pronounced. Eventually, the effect becomes so great that the maximum kinetic energy is not enough to return the orbit above the limits of the atmospheric drag effect. When this happens the body will rapidly spiral down and intersect the central body.|$|E

500|$|On March 30, 2006, MRO {{began the}} process of aerobraking, a three-step {{procedure}} that cuts in half the fuel needed to achieve a lower, more circular orbit with a shorter period. First, during its first five orbits of the planet (one Earth week), MRO used its thrusters to drop the <b>periapsis</b> of its orbit into aerobraking altitude. This altitude depends on {{the thickness of the}} atmosphere because Martian atmospheric density changes with its seasons. Second, while using its thrusters to make minor corrections to its <b>periapsis</b> altitude, MRO maintained aerobraking altitude for 445 planetary orbits (about five Earth months) to reduce the apoapsis of the orbit to [...] This was done in such a way so as to not heat the spacecraft too much, but also dip enough into the atmosphere to slow the spacecraft down. After the process was complete, MRO used its thrusters to move its <b>periapsis</b> out of the edge of the Martian atmosphere on August 30, 2006.|$|E
500|$|The ε ring is the {{brightest}} and densest {{part of the}} Uranian ring system, and is responsible for {{about two-thirds of the}} light reflected by the rings. [...] While it is the most eccentric of the Uranian rings, it has negligible orbital inclination. The ring's eccentricity causes its brightness to vary over the course of its orbit. The radially integrated brightness of the ε ring is highest near apoapsis and lowest near <b>periapsis.</b> The maximum/minimum brightness ratio is about 2.5–3.0. These variations are connected with the variations of the ring width, which is 19.7km at the <b>periapsis</b> and 96.4km at the apoapsis. As the ring becomes wider, the amount of shadowing between particles decreases and more of them come into view, leading to higher integrated brightness. The width variations were measured directly from Voyager 2 images, as the ε ring was one of only two rings resolved by Voyager’s cameras. Such behavior indicates that the ring is not optically thin. Indeed, occultation observations conducted from the ground and the spacecraft showed that its normal optical depth varies between 0.5 and 2.5, being highest near the <b>periapsis.</b> The equivalent depth of the ε ring is around 47km and is invariant around the orbit.|$|E
500|$|This {{constant}} {{areal velocity}} {{can be calculated}} as follows.

500|$|Completion of {{the orbital}} {{insertion}} placed the orbiter {{in a highly}} elliptical polar orbit with a period of approximately 35.5 hours. Shortly after insertion, the <b>periapsis</b> – {{the point in the}} orbit closest to Mars – was [...] from the surface ( [...] from the planet's center).

500|$|Thus, if {{the energy}} E is {{negative}} (bound orbits), the eccentricity {{is less than}} one and the orbit is an ellipse. [...] Conversely, if the energy is positive (unbound orbits, also called [...] "scattered orbits"), the eccentricity is greater than one and the orbit is a hyperbola. [...] Finally, if the energy is exactly zero, the eccentricity is one and the orbit is a parabola. [...] In all cases, the direction of A lies along the symmetry axis of the conic section and points {{from the center of}} force toward the <b>periapsis,</b> the point of closest approach.|$|E
500|$|The JAXA probe Akatsuki, {{launched}} in May 2010, {{was intended to}} study the planet {{for a period of}} two years, including the structure and activity of the atmosphere, but it failed to enter Venus orbit in December 2010.

With a highly eccentric orbit (<b>periapsis</b> altitude of 400km and apoapsis of 310,000km), {{it will be able to}} take close-up photographs of the planet, and should also confirm the presence of both active volcanoes as well as lightning.|$|E
500|$|The tidal heating of Io is {{dependent}} on its distance from Jupiter, its orbital eccentricity, the composition of its interior, and its physical state. Its Laplace orbital resonance with Europa and Ganymede maintains Io's eccentricity and prevents tidal dissipation within Io from circularizing its orbit. The eccentricity leads to vertical differences in Io's tidal bulge {{of as much as}} [...] as Jupiter's gravitational pull varies between the <b>periapsis</b> and apoapsis points in Io's orbit. This varying tidal pull also produces friction in Io's interior, enough to cause significant tidal heating and melting. Unlike Earth, where most of its internal heat is released by conduction through the crust, on Io internal heat is released via volcanic activity and generates the satellite's high heat flow (global total: 0.6–1.6 W). Models of its orbit suggest that the amount of tidal heating within Io changes with time, and that the current heat flow is not representative of the long-term average. The observed release of heat from Io's interior is greater than estimates for the amount presently generated from tidal heating, suggesting that Io is cooling after a period of greater flexing.|$|E
500|$|Unlike Earth and the Moon, Io's {{main source}} of {{internal}} heat comes from tidal dissipation rather than radioactive isotope decay, the result of Io's orbital resonance with Europa and Ganymede. Such heating is dependent on Io's distance from Jupiter, its orbital eccentricity, the composition of its interior, and its physical state. Its Laplace resonance with Europa and Ganymede maintains Io's eccentricity and prevents tidal dissipation within Io from circularizing its orbit. The resonant orbit also helps to maintain Io's distance from Jupiter; otherwise tides raised on Jupiter would cause Io to slowly spiral outward from its parent planet. The vertical differences in Io's tidal bulge, between the times Io is at <b>periapsis</b> and apoapsis in its orbit, could {{be as much as}} [...] The friction or tidal dissipation produced in Io's interior due to this varying tidal pull, which, without the resonant orbit, would have gone into circularizing Io's orbit instead, creates significant tidal heating within Io's interior, melting a significant amount of Io's mantle and core. The amount of energy produced is up to 200 times greater than that produced solely from radioactive decay. This heat is released in the form of volcanic activity, generating its observed high heat flow (global total: 0.6 to 1.6×1014W). Models of its orbit suggest that the amount of tidal heating within Io changes with time; however, the current amount of tidal dissipation is consistent with the observed heat flow. Models of tidal heating and convection have not found consistent planetary viscosity profiles that simultaneously match tidal energy dissipation and mantle convection of heat to the surface.|$|E
