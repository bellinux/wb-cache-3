5|$|A {{major problem}} in sending space <b>probes</b> to Jupiter is that the planet has no solid surface on which to land, {{as there is a}} smooth {{transition}} between the planet's atmosphere and its fluid interior.

5|$|The {{development}} of space travel gave scientists {{the opportunity to}} study the comet at close quarters, and several <b>probes</b> were launched to do so. The Soviet Vega 1 started returning images of Halley on 4 March 1986, and the first ever of its nucleus, and made its flyby on 6 March, followed by Vega 2 making its flyby on 9 March. On 14 March, the Giotto space probe, launched by the European Space Agency, made the closest pass of the comet's nucleus. There were also two Japanese <b>probes,</b> Suisei and Sakigake.

5|$|An {{extraterrestrial}} civilization {{may choose}} to communicate with humanity by means of artifacts or <b>probes</b> rather than by radio, for various reasons. While <b>probes</b> may {{take a long time}} to reach the Solar System, once there they would be able to hold a sustained dialogue that would be impossible using radio from hundreds or thousands of light-years away. Radio would be completely unsuitable for surveillance and continued monitoring of a civilization, and should an extraterrestrial civilization wish to perform these activities on humanity, artifacts may be the only option other than to send large, crewed spacecraft to the Solar System.|$|E

5|$|Freitas finds {{numerous}} {{reasons why}} interstellar <b>probes</b> {{may be a}} preferred method of communication among extraterrestrial civilizations wishing {{to make contact with}} Earth. A civilization aiming {{to learn more about the}} distribution of life within the galaxy might, he speculates, send <b>probes</b> to a large number of star systems, rather than using radio, as one cannot ensure a response by radio but can (he says) ensure that <b>probes</b> will return to their sender with data on the star systems they survey. Furthermore, <b>probes</b> would enable the surveying of non-intelligent populations, or those not yet capable of space navigation (like humans before the 20th century), as well as intelligent populations that might not wish to provide information about themselves and their planets to extraterrestrial civilizations. In addition, the greater energy required to send living beings rather than a robotic probe would, according to Michaud, be only used for purposes such as a one-way migration.|$|E

40|$|We report {{molecular}} dynamics simulations {{of the effect}} of the photoisomerization of <b>probe</b> molecules on the nonequilibrium dynamics of a bulk amorphous matrix. Is it the matrix or the <b>probe</b> that drives the dynamics in SRG formation? In the first picture, the <b>probe</b> isomerization induces the motion of the <b>probe</b> inside the matrix. The motion of the <b>probe</b> then induces molecular motions inside the matrix. In the second picture, the <b>probe</b> isomerization induces a modification of the matrix diffusion mechanism. The diffusion of the matrix then induces the motion of the embedded <b>probe.</b> To answer this question, we compare the motion of the <b>probe</b> molecules and the motion of the matrix molecules in various thermodynamic conditions. We show that when the isomerization is switched on, the matrix molecules surrounding the <b>probe</b> move faster than the <b>probe.</b> Around the <b>probe,</b> the structural relaxation time of the matrix molecules is shorter than the <b>probe</b> relaxation time and the diffusion of the matrix molecules is larger than the <b>probe</b> diffusion.

5|$|Freitas {{points out}} that <b>probes,</b> unlike the {{interstellar}} radio waves commonly targeted by SETI searches, could store information for long, perhaps geological, timescales, and could emit strong radio signals unambiguously recognizable as being of intelligent origin, rather than being dismissed as a UFO or a natural phenomenon. <b>Probes</b> could also modify any signal they send to suit the system they were in, which {{would be impossible for}} a radio transmission originating from outside the target star system. Moreover, the use of small robotic <b>probes</b> with widely distributed beacons in individual systems, rather than a small number of powerful, centralized beacons, would provide a security advantage to the civilization using them. Rather than revealing the location of a radio beacon powerful enough to signal the whole galaxy and risk such a powerful device being compromised, decentralized beacons installed on robotic <b>probes</b> need not reveal any information that an extraterrestrial civilization prefers others not to have.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Neural <b>probe</b> array is {{utilized}} in neural recording, in the aim {{to understand the}} neural activity. Silicon is the common substrate used in neural <b>probe</b> array. However, due to the rigid nature, the silicon-based neural <b>probe</b> array causes cell damage during implantation into the brain tissue. This would reduce the signal-to-noise ratio. Therefore, flexible polymer <b>probe</b> is more suitable as it can help to minimize the tissue damage and thus increasing the signal-to-noise ratio. The lack of stiffness for the flexible <b>probe</b> is solved by coating it with polyethylene glycol (PEG). It stiffens the <b>probe</b> and can be dissolved in water, which allows the polymer <b>probe</b> to regain its flexibility. The proposed integrated <b>probe</b> with reduced distance between <b>probe</b> and ASIC will further help to improve the signal-to-noise ratio during neural recording.
