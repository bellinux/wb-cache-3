50|$|The {{release lever}} (L) holds the rack (M) {{up when the}} clock is not striking. On the shaft of the minute hand (not shown), which rotates once per hour, there is a {{projection}}. As the change of the hour approaches, this projection slowly lifts the release lever, allowing the rack to fall until its point rests on the snail (N). The amount the rack can fall, and thus the number of strikes, {{is determined by the}} position of the snail. Exactly on the hour the striking train (G, H, K) is released and begins to turn. As it turns, the pins (G) repeatedly lift the hammer (F) and allow it to drop, ringing the gong (E). The gear ratios are arranged so that the gear wheel (H) makes one revolution each strike. A small <b>pin</b> (<b>S)</b> on this wheel engages the rack teeth, lifting the rack up by one tooth each turn. When the rack reaches the end of its teeth it stops the striking train from turning (using a mechanism not shown in the diagram, {{in such a way that}} gear (H) is held stationary with the <b>pin</b> (<b>S)</b> not engaging the rack, so that the rack is able to fall freely again on the next hour). So the number of strikes is equal to the number of teeth of the rack which are used, which depends on the position of the snail.|$|E
40|$|Abstract In this paper, {{we focus}} on mining {{periodic}} patterns allowing some de-gree of imperfection {{in the form of}} random replacement from a perfect periodic pattern. Information gain was proposed to identify patternswith events of vastly different occurrence frequencies and adjust for the deviation from a pattern. However, it does not take any penaltyif there exists some gap between the pattern occurrences. In many applications, e. g., bio-informatics, it is important to identify subse-quences that a pattern repeats perfectly (or near perfectly). As a solution, we extend the information gain measure to include a penaltyfor gaps between pattern occurrences. We call this measure as generalized information gain. Furthermore, we want to find subsequence S 0 such that for a pattern P, the generalized information gain of <b>Pin</b> <b>S</b> 0 is high. This is particularly useful in locating repeats in DNA sequences.

40|$|Based on the {{spontaneous}} breaking of chiral symmetry, chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) is be-lieved to approximate confinement scale QCD. Dedicated and increasingly accurate experiments and improving lattice calculations are confirming this belief, {{and we are}} entering {{a new era in}} which we can test confinement scale QCD in some well chosen reactions. This is demonstrated with an overview of low energy experimental tests of ChPT predictions of pipi scattering, pion properties, piN scattering and electromagnetic pion production. These predictions {{have been shown to be}} consistent with QCD in the meson sector by increasingly accurate lattice calcula-tions. At present there is good agreement between experiment and ChPT calculations, including the pipi and <b>piN</b> <b>s</b> wave scattering lengths and the pi 0 lifetime. Recent, accurate pionic atom data are in agreement with chiral calculations once isospin breaking effects due to the mass difference of the up and down quarks are taken into account, as was required to extract the pipi scattering lengths. In addition to tests of the theory, comparisons between pipi and piN interactions based on general chiral principles are discussed. Lattice calculations are now providing results for the fun-damental, long and inconclusively studied, piN σ term and the contribution of the strange quark to the mass of the proton. Increasingly accurate experiments in electromagnetic pion production experiments from the proton which test ChPT calculations (and their energy region of validity) are presented. These experiments are also beginning to measure the final state piN interaction...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{reducing}} geometries is {{very often}} evoked to explain experimental shifts of water properties occluded inside small cavities. At nanometric level, the deviation of water properties can be modelled and measured and both results agree that from 5 nm (10 nm at max.) to smaller confinement, the finite size effects play a growing role {{to control the}} water thermodynamics. In the meantime, collecting large-scale evidences, like the phase transitions and chemical saturations states observed/measured in natural aquifers, the threshold between macroscopic and nanoscopic domains appears much more unclear, extending to 0. 1 μm or more. The question thus arises as {{for the existence of}} intermediate mesoscopic behaviors, between truly nanoscopic and truly macroscopic domains. Recently, we accumulated a large number of measurements (vibrational and X spectroscopies, phase transitions) on water occluded in different types of cavities (closed cavities in quartz = fluid inclusions, open nano-channels patterned inside silicon wafers, pores membranes, capillaries), and sometimes on the container. These measurements tend to demonstrate that the properties of the water body can change {{as a function of the}} distance to interfaces (over 1 - 3 micrometers !) and as a function of the confinement degree from around 35 - 40 nm. These measurements open the discussion to the surface-to-volume competition in thermodynamics, especially when addressing two-phases (or more) systems. Thermodynamics of small systems appears attractive to deal with the evident size effect in confinement regime, though it is visible at sizes larger than usually defined. Another challenge is to thermodynamically describe biphasic frontiers using surfacial formalism, possibly requiring, in certain cases, the definition of an interfacial phase with finite width, instead of an abrupt interface between two bulk phases. In both cases, the characteristic threshold between bulk and “others” behaviors should be calculated and generalized on thermodynamic grounds.

As a result, a dc current {{can be used}} to generate spin oscillations. We review theory and experimental evidence. The s-d exchange interaction causes a rapid precession of itinerant conduction-electron spins s around the localized spins S of magnetic electrons. This s precession has been observed directly (Weber et al., 2001) with electron beams through Fe, Co, and Ni films. Because of it, the time-averaged interaction torque between s and S vanishes. Thus, electrons do not interact at all with long-wavelength spin waves, in the bulk.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundFormation of {{epithelial}} sheets {{requires that}} cell division {{occurs in the}} plane of the sheet. During mitosis, spindle poles align so the astral microtubules contact the lateral cortex. Confinement of the mammalian Pins protein to the lateral cortex is essential for this process. Defects in signaling through Cdc 42 and atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) also cause spindle misorientation. When epithelial cysts are grown in 3 D cultures, misorientation creates multiple lumens. ResultsWe now show that silencing of the polarity protein Par 3 causes spindle misorientation in Madin-Darby canine kidney cell cysts. Silencing of Par 3 also disrupts aPKC association with the apical cortex, but expression of an apically tethered aPKC rescues normal lumen formation. During mitosis, Pins is mislocalized to the apical surface in the absence of Par 3 or by inhibition of aPKC. Active aPKC increases Pins phosphorylation on Ser 401, which recruits 14 - 3 - 3 protein. 14 - 3 - 3 binding inhibits association of Pins with Gαi, through which Pins attaches to the cortex. A <b>Pins</b> <b>S</b> 401 A mutant mislocalizes over the cell cortex and causes spindle orientation and lumen defects. ConclusionsThe Par 3 and aPKC polarity proteins ensure correct spindle pole orientation during epithelial cell division by excluding Pins from the apical cortex. Apical aPKC phosphorylates Pins, which results in the recruitment of 14 - 3 - 3 and inhibition of binding to Gαi, so the Pins falls off the cortex. In the absence of a functional exclusion mechanism, astral microtubules can associate with Pins over the entire epithelial cortex, resulting in randomized spindle pole orientation...|$|R

40|$|The {{phytohormone}} auxin {{is a major}} {{determinant of}} plant growth and development. Many aspects of its action depend on the formation of local maxima or gradients within tissues. PIN-FORMED (PIN) proteins facilitate auxin efflux from cells and, by their dynamic polar localization, provide a basis for its directional transport. PIN-dependent auxin transport is regulated by several members of the plant specific AGCVIII kinase family. Phosphorylation of the central serine residues in three conserved TPRXS(N/S) motifs by PIONOID (PID) is crucial for polar targeting of PINs. The D 6 protein kinases (D 6 PKs) were also shown {{to be involved in the}} control of polar auxin transport and are functionally linked to PIN 1 and PIN 3, however they do not interfere with PIN subcellular localization. In this work, the X. laevis oocyte expression system was used to study the impact of D 6 PK and other representative members of the AGCVIII kinase family on transport activity of PIN 1 and PIN 3. An assay was established that allowed monitoring auxin efflux after direct injection of oocytes with radiolabeled substrate. It could be shown that co-expression of PIN 1 and PIN 3 proteins with D 6 PK or PID results in phosphorylation of PINs and in enhanced auxin efflux. Contrarily, expression of PIN proteins alone did not cause measurable auxin efflux when compared to water-injected control oocytes. Based on the observation that a kinase-inactive version of D 6 PK could no longer stimulate PIN-mediated auxin efflux, it was concluded that phosphorylation is essential for PIN function. Activation of PIN 1 and PIN 3 could be achieved by co-expression of D 6 PK and PID, but not two other members of the AGCVIII kinase family, PHOT 1 and UNC, demonstrating the specificity of the interaction between PINs and D 6 PK / PID. Analyses of different mutants lead to the identification of phosphorylation target sites that are essential for D 6 PK / PID – mediated PIN 1 transport activity. A serine to alanine substitution at position 271 caused decreased auxin efflux from <b>PIN</b> 1 <b>S</b> 271 A / D 6 PK co-expressing oocytes, but had no effect on PID mediated activation, indicating that S 271 is important for D 6 PK function, while PID acts independently of S 271, i. e. vy phosphorylation of different residues. Consistently, an opposite effect was observed in a <b>PIN</b> 1 <b>S</b> 231 A/S 252 A/S 290 A triple mutant with alanines replacing the central serines in the TPRXS(N/S) motifs. The different impacts of the S 271 A and the S 231 A/S 252 A/S 290 A mutations on D 6 PK and PID function suggested that activation of PIN 1 by D 6 PK is mediated preferentially via phosphorylation of S 271 A whereas PID favors the central serines in the TPRXS(N/S) motifs, thereby regulating polarity as well as activity. While both <b>PIN</b> 1 <b>S</b> 271 A as well as the triple mutant <b>PIN</b> 1 <b>S</b> 231 A/S 252 A/S 290 A could still mediate enhanced auxin efflux from oocytes when co-expressed with D 6 PK or PID, although to a varying extent, transport activity was almost completely lost in a combined quadruple mutant <b>PIN</b> 1 <b>S</b> 231 A/S 252 A/S 271 A/S 290 A. The results obtained from the analysis of PIN 1 mutants suggest that the main phosphorylation sites that contribute to PIN 1 activatability by D 6 PK and PID have been identified and include S 271 as well as S 231 /S 252 /S 290. However, it was clearly demonstrated that not all of the sites have to be phosphorylated at the same time to confer transport activity to PIN 1. In fact, phosphorylation of either S 271 or one or more of the S 231 /S 252 /S 290 sites is sufficient for transport activity under the given experimental conditions. PIN 3 generally exhibited higher transport rates than PIN 1 when co-expressed with an activating kinase, probably reflecting its function in processes that involve rapid polar redistribution of auxin. A serine to alanine exchange at position 262 of PIN 3 which corresponds to <b>S</b> 271 in <b>PIN</b> 1 had no effect on the activation by either D 6 PK or PID when compare to wild type PIN 3 indicating that different amino acid residues are important for PIN 3 activity. In summary, the results obtained in the first part of this work provide evidence that the transport activity of the auxin efflux carriers PIN 1 and PIN 3 is controlled by the AGCVIII kinases D 6 PK and PID and depends on phosphorylation of specific amino acid residues, thereby giving important insights into the biochemical mechanisms that control PIN protein function. In the second part of the thesis, the role of phytohormone responses in plant-nematode interactions was studied. Plant parasitic nematodes are destructive pathogens with a broad host range and cause enormous yield losses each year. The sedentary endoparasitic nematodes are divided into two groups, the root knot nematodes (RKN) and the cyst nematodes (CN). The free living juveniles of RKN and CN enter their host plant’s roots and induce the formation of highly specialized feeding sites termed giant cells or syncytia, respectively, in the vascular cylinder. From these feeding sites, all the nutrients required for growth and development of the nematodes are withdrawn. Giant cells and syncytia are functionally equivalent and represent strong terminal sink tissues. However they differ in their genesis and in the way how they are loaded with nutrients. While syncytia are connected to the surrounding vasculature by plasmodesmata, giant cells are symplastically isolated and nutrient uptake occurs via membrane dependent processes. Both syncytia and giant cells are enclosed in vascular tissue which is formed de novo and is required for the transport of nutrients towards the feeding sites. The unloading phloem that is induced around syncytia consists of sieve elements and companion cells with the ratio shifted towards an excess of sieve elements. Giant cells on the other hand are surrounded by a unique phloem tissue that is built up of nucleate sieve elements whereas companion cells are absent. It was shown before that both CN and RKN secrete auxin- and cytokinin-like compounds and that auxin plays an important role in the establishment of the feeding sites. However, nothing was known about how the vascularization of syncytia and giant cells is controlled and whether phytohormones play a role in this process. Therefore auxin and cytokinin responses were monitored in nematode infected Arabidopsis roots using the synthetic hormone responsive promoters DR 5 and TCS, respectively, fused to the coding sequence for ER-localized green fluorescent protein (GFP). GFP fluorescence was recorded and immunohistochemical experiments were performed in order to identify the cell types within the nematode induced tissues that responded to the phytohormones. This provided insights into a possible function of phytohormone dependent processes in feeding site vascularization. In uninfected differentiated parts of control roots a constitutive auxin response was found in companion cells, but no response to cytokinin mediated by B-type response regulators was observed. Neither giant cells nor syncytia themselves responded to auxin or cytokinin at the timepoints of the infection cycle that were analyzed in this work but the response was limited to cells that surrounded the feeding sites. The observed hormone responses differed between RKN and CN-induced tissues. In developing root knots, an auxin response in cells around the giant cells preceded their subsequent differentiation into sieve elements, which were identified using a well established sieve element marker. Possibly, the auxin response primes these cells for the differentiation process. GFP signal was retained even after the responding cells had assumed sieve element identity while cells that tested positive only for GFP but not for the sieve element marker were an exception in the mature root knot. The latter observation adds further evidence to the previously described finding that companion cells are absent from fully developed root knots. Cytokinin signaling could not be observed in root knots of PTCS:ER-GFP plants which means that either cytokinin levels are low or cells are not susceptible to the signal. In contrast to the situation in root knots, the phloem around syncytia responded to both hormones. Auxin response was detected in companion cells and sieve elements while cytokinin response was limited to the sieve elements. Taking into account the distinct characteristics of the phloem tissues around syncytia and giant cells and the differential hormone responses, the ratio of cytokinin and auxin response might contribute to the identity of the de novo formed phloem, i. e. metaphloem in CN induced tissues and protophloem in RKN induced tissues...|$|R

Today, this region is experiencing the highest relative rates of deforestation and forest degradation in the humid tropics. Every year, millions of hectares of tropical forests are destroyed and degraded. Given the rapid {{rate of deforestation}} and the high concentration of endemic species in the region, Southeast Asia could lose 13 – 42 % of local populations {{by the turn of}} the next century, at least 50 % of which could represent global species extinction. In this Special Issue, we discuss the uniqueness of Southeast Asian biodiversity, drivers of forest destruction, threats to the region’s unique ecosystems and taxa, and key conservation challenges to provide a broad-based review of the science, management and policy issues concerning biodiversity conservation. Overall, we highlight the need for an interdisciplinary and multi-pronged strategy requiring all major stakeholders to work together to achieve the ultimate goal of reconciling biodiversity conservation and human well-being in the region.

40|$|Aetiology of {{neurodegenerative}} mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) {{are still}} under elucidation. The contribution of cerebrovascular deficiencies (such as cerebral ischemia/stroke) has been strongly endorsed in recent years. Reduction of blood supply leading to hypoxic condition is known to activate cellular responses mainly controlled by hypoxia-inducible transcription factor- 1 (HIF- 1). Thus alterations of oxygen responsive HIF- 1 α subunit in {{the central nervous system}} may contribute to the cognitive decline, especially influencing mechanisms associated to APP (amyloid precursor protein) amyloidogenic metabolism. Although HIF- 1 α protein level is known to be regulated by von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) ubiquitin-proteasome system, it has been recently suggested that Gsk- 3 β (glycogen synthase kinase- 3 β) promotes a VHL-independent HIF- 1 α degradation. Here we provide evidences that in rat primary hippocampal cell cultures, HIF- 1 α degradation might be mediated by a synergic action of Gsk- 3 β and Pin 1 (peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase). In post-ischemic conditions, such as those mimicked with oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD), HIF- 1 α protein level increases remaining unexpectedly high for long time after normal condition restoration jointly with the increase of LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) and BACE 1 (β-secretase 1) protein expression (70 % and 140 % respectively). Interestingly the Pin 1 activity decreases about 40 %- 60 % and <b>Pin</b> 1 <b>S</b> 16 inhibitory phosphorylation significantly increases, indicating that Pin 1 binding to its substrate and enzymatic activity are reduced by treatment. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that HIF- 1 α/Pin 1 in normoxia are associated, and that in presence of specific Pin 1 and Gsk- 3 β inhibitors their interaction is reduced in parallel to an increase of HIF- 1 α protein level. Thus we suggest that in post-OGD neurons the high level of HIF- 1 α might be due to Pin 1 binding ability and activity reduction which affects HIF- 1 α degradation: an even...|$|R

Oral PresentationSmall-angle neutron {{scattering}} experiments {{were carried out}} at room temperature on pD 6. 6 solutions of horse heart azidometmyoglobin (MbN_ 3) at pressures up to 300 MPa. The measurements were performed using various concentrations of MbN_ 3 {{in order to determine}} the second virial coefficient of the protein solution and the actual radius of gyration of the protein. The results [1] shows that the interactions between the macromolecules are always strongly repulsive, even if their magnitude decreases with increasing pressure, whereas the radius of gyration of the protein remains constant. This indicates that the compactness of MbN_ 3 is not altered by pressures up to 300 MPa. However it is possible that a molten globule forms at the highest investigated pressures. Taking advantage of the pressure-induced contrast variation of the protein these experiments allow the partial specific volume of MbN_ 3 to be determined as a function of pressure. Its value decreases by about 5. 4 % between atmospheric pressure and 300 MPa. In this range the isothermal compressibility of hydrated MbN_ 3 is found to be (1. 6 ± 0. 1) 10 ^- 4 MPa^- 1 [1]. This result will be compared with those obtained by means of other techniques. [1] C. Loupiac, M. Bonetti, <b>S.</b> <b>Pin</b> and P. Calmettes, Eur. Jour. Biochem. 269 (2002) 4731 - 473...|$|R
40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. comWidespread and rapid losses of natural habitats and biodiversity have made the identification of extinction-prone species a major challenge in conservation biology. We assessed {{the relative importance of}} biologically relevant species traits (e. g., body size, ecological specialization) obtained from published records to determine the extinction probability of butterflies in a highly disturbed tropical landscape (i. e., Singapore). We also developed a taxon-specific model to estimate the extinction proneness of butterflies in Southeast Asia. Logistic regression analyses showed that adult habitat specialization, larval host plant specificity, geographical distribution, sexual dichromatism, and congenor density were significant and independent determinants of butterfly extinctions in Singapore. Among these traits, specificity of larval host plant and adult habitat specialization were the best correlates of extinction risks. We used this phenomenological extinction-regression model to estimate the relative extinction proneness of 416 butterfly species in Southeast Asia. Our results illustrate the utility of available taxon-specific data for a localized area in estimating the extinction proneness of closely related species on a regional scale. When intensive field studies are not forthcoming, especially in regions suffering from rapid biodiversity losses (e. g., Southeast Asia), similar approaches could be used to estimate extinction threats for other taxonomic groups.

40|$|Journal {{compilation}} © 2008 Blackwell PublishingRapid {{losses and}} degradation of natural habitats {{in the tropics}} are driving catastrophic declines and extinctions of native biotas, including angiosperms. Determining the ecological and life-history correlates of extinction proneness in tropical plant species may help reveal the mechanisms underlying their responses to habitat disturbance, and assist in the pre-emptive identification of species at risk from extinction. We determined the predictors of extinction proneness in 1884 locally extinct (n = 454) and extant (n = 1430) terrestrial angiosperms (belonging to 43 orders, 133 families, and 689 genera) in the tropical island nation of Singapore (699. 4 km 2), which has lost 99. 6 % of its primary lowland evergreen rainforest since 1819. A wide variety of traits such as geographical distribution, pollination system, sexual system, habit, habitat, height, fruit/seed dispersal mechanism, and capacity for vegetative re-sprouting {{were used in the}} analysis. Despite controlling for phylogeny (as approximated by family level classification), we found that {{only a small percentage of}} the variation in the extinction probability could be explained by these factors. Epiphytic, monoecious, and hermaphroditic species and those restricted to inland forests have higher probabilities of extinction. Species dependent on mammal pollinators also probably have higher extinction probabilities. More comparative studies that use species traits to identify extinction-prone plant species are needed to guide the enormous, but essential task of identifying species most in need of conservation action.
