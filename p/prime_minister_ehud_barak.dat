25|$|He {{was accused}} of {{choosing}} to undertake the Israeli Ministry of Defense portfolio merely because of its prestige {{and that he should}} have demanded the Ministry of Finance portfolio that better corresponds with his and the Labor Party social agenda.

He was defeated by former Labor Party chairman and former <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Ehud</b> <b>Barak</b> and chose to resign from his post.|$|E
25|$|At the 1972 Munich Olympics, {{two members}} of the Israeli team were killed, and nine members taken hostage by Palestinian terrorists. A botched German rescue attempt led to the death of the rest along with five of the eight hijackers. The three {{surviving}} Palestinians were released by the West German authorities eight weeks later without charge, in exchange for the hostages of hijacked Lufthansa Flight 615. The Israeli government responded with a bombing, an assassination campaign against the organizers of the massacre and a raid on the PLO headquarters in Lebanon (led by future <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister,</b> <b>Ehud</b> <b>Barak).</b>|$|E
25|$|Following the riots, a {{high degree}} of tension between Jewish and Arab {{citizens}} and distrust between the Arab citizens and police were widespread. An investigation committee, headed by Supreme Court Justice Theodor Or, reviewed the violent riots and found that the police were poorly prepared to handle such riots and charged major officers with bad conduct. The Or Commission reprimanded <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Ehud</b> <b>Barak</b> and recommended Shlomo Ben-Ami, then the Internal Security Minister, not serve again as Minister of Public Security. The committee also blamed Arab leaders and Knesset members for contributing to inflaming the atmosphere and making the violence more severe.|$|E
5000|$|The Taba Summit (also {{known as}} Taba Talks, Taba Conference or short Taba) were talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, held from 21 to 27 January 2001 at Taba, in the Sinai.

The party won seven Knesset seats in 1996. It won 6 seats in the Israeli legislative election, 1999, gaining two ministerial posts, but left the government on 11 July 2000 in response to suggestions that <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Ehud</b> <b>Barak's</b> negotiations with the Palestinians {{would result in a}} division of Jerusalem.

There was a hopeful precedent in the 1978 Camp David Accords where President Jimmy Carter was able to broker a peace agreement between Egypt, represented by President Anwar Sadat, and Israel represented by Prime Minister Menachem Begin. The Oslo Accords of 1993 between the later assassinated Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat had provided that agreement should be reached on all outstanding issues between the Palestinians and Israeli sides – the so-called final status settlement – within five years of the implementation of Palestinian autonomy. However, the interim process put in place under Oslo had fulfilled neither Israeli nor Palestinian expectations.|$|E
25|$|In the sabbatical year of 2000, Bakshi-Doron became {{involved}} in a disagreement {{with some of the}} leading rabbis in Israel. In order to get around the Halakhic prohibitions of shmita, in which farmland must lie fallow once every seven years, some Sephardi and Zionist rabbis had allowed the use of land-sale contracts (heter mechira), through the use of which farmers could symbolically sell their land to non-Jews for the sabbatical year, thereby permitting them to continue farming. The permits immediately came under fire by Haredi rabbi Yosef Shalom Eliashiv. Bakshi-Doron and Lau, with the support of former Sephardi Chief Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, ruled that the permits were valid. When Bakshi-Doron publicly told the farmers that they could rely on the sales, the Haredi newspaper Yated Ne'eman began to leak word that Eliashiv would deligitimize him and put him and his family in herem (excommunication) if he refused to back down. Distraught, Bakshi-Doron went to meet with Israeli President Moshe Katsav, reportedly bursting into tears. Despite the open support of Katsav and Israeli <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Ehud</b> <b>Barak,</b> Bakshi-Doron ultimately succumbed to the pressure from Eliashiv. This was widely seen by the National Religious camp as surrender to the Haredim.|$|E

40|$|Throughout 2001, the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, {{punctuated by}} {{gestures}} {{of peace and}} acts of violence, continued in its cycle of promise and disappointment. It was a year {{of changes in the}} Israeli and American administrations, as well as a call for a change in the Palestinian administration. It was a year which saw American involvement wax and wane and wax again. Although to no avail, U. S. President Bill Clinton strove to facilitate a lasting peace in the closing days of his presidency. Incoming President George W. Bush, stepping back in the initial months of his presidency from such intense American involvement in the region, retracted Clinton’s final peace plan. Soon, however, Bush realized the need to send a special envoy, General Anthony Zinni to the region in an attempt to support the diplomatic work of C. I. A. Director George Tenet to implement the Mitchell recommendations for peace. Despite Israeli <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Ehud</b> <b>Barak’s</b> peace efforts, he was defeated in the February Israeli elections.

500|$|Hezbollah {{emerged in}} South Lebanon during a {{consolidation}} of Shia militias as a rival {{to the older}} Amal Movement. Hezbollah {{played a significant role}} in the Lebanese civil war, opposing American forces in 1982–83 and opposing Amal and Syria during the 1985–88 War of the Camps. However, Hezbollah's early primary focus was ending Israel's occupation of southern Lebanon following Israel's 1982 invasion and siege of Beirut. Amal, the main Lebanese Shia political group, initiated guerrilla warfare. In 2006, former Israeli <b>prime</b> <b>minister</b> <b>Ehud</b> <b>Barak</b> stated, [...] "When we entered Lebanon … there was no Hezbollah. We were accepted with perfumed rice and flowers by the Shia in the south. It was our presence there that created Hezbollah".|$|E
500|$|After initial successes {{such as the}} Oslo Accords of {{the early}} 1990s, which also led to the Israel–Jordan peace treaty in 1994 and the Wye River Memorandum in October 1998, Clinton {{attempted}} an effort to end the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. He brought Israeli <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Ehud</b> <b>Barak</b> and Palestinian Authority chairman Yasser Arafat together at Camp David for the Camp David Summit in July 2000, which lasted 14 days. Following {{the failures of the}} peace talks, Clinton stated Arafat [...] "missed the opportunity" [...] to facilitate a [...] "just and lasting peace". In his autobiography, Clinton blames Arafat for the collapse of the summit. Following another attempt in December 2000 at Bolling Air Force Base, in which the president offered the Clinton Parameters, the situation broke down completely {{after the end of the}} Taba Summit and with the start of the Second Intifada.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the year}} and a half between 1999 and 2000, the IDF, {{seconded}} by the Shin Bet and the Israeli Border Police, had asked the government to evacuate the tomb. [...] In September 2000, in the wake of Ariel Sharon’s controversial visit to the Temple Mount, [...] the Al-Aqsa Intifada broke out, and Nablus turned into conflict zone, in part after its governor’s son was shot dead during a clash with Israeli soldiers. The Palestinians targeted the site, reportedly {{on the grounds that it}} was better for the shrine to belong to no one than to be appropriated by just one religion, burning the yeshiva to the ground, incinerating its books and painting the dome green, an act which led to retaliation with Jewish vandalism of three mosques in Tiberias and Jaffa. After the death of an Israeli border policeman [...] the head of the IDF’s southern command, Brigadier-General Yom-Tov Samia, threatened to resign if the government kept control of the tomb, since retaining control of it was ‘patently illegal.’ <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Ehud</b> <b>Barak</b> [...] eventually complied with the request and the site was handed over to the Palestinian police on October 7, 2000. [...] Israeli newspapers framed the return of the site as a humiliating defeat for the nation. The tomb was pillaged and torched by Palestinian protesters hours after its evacuation. The next morning, the bullet-riddled body of rabbi Hillel Lieberman of Elon Moreh, a cousin of Senator Joseph Lieberman, was found on the outskirts of Nablus, where he had gone to check damage to the tomb. Joseph’s Tomb embodied a key Zionist theme: the return from exile to one’s homeland, and the Palestinian assault has been interpreted as challenging the credibility of claims to the site. The PA began to repair it the next day. Palestinian spokesperson Hanan Ashrawi claimed that Judaism's connection with the tomb was 'fabricated'. The mayor of Nablus Ghassan Shakaa was reported as saying Jewish worshippers would not be permitted to pray there until an international organization or third party determines whether the site is holy to Moslems or Jews.|$|E

With the inclusion of the Minister Yuval Steinitz to the ministerial forum the name was changed to the Octet (השמינייה).
