This paper analyses the relationships of both vascular and cardiac components with the blood pressure. As there is no known equation ruling PEP, a lumped model of arterial circulation is used to study the dependencies between blood pressure and PEP. When the peripheral resistance varies PEP shows a direct correlation with the blood pressure, opposite to the inverse pulse transit time dependency.

40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze pulse wave {{propagation}} in the ocular circulation by assessing the phase delay between retinal arterioles and venules and calculating the <b>pulse</b> <b>delay</b> between the retinal and choroidal circulations in MS patients and in control subjects. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with multiple sclerosis (38. 3 +/- 6. 2 years) and twenty healthy subjects (37. 4 +/- 15. 2 years) were examined with the Retinal Vessel Analyzer. In addition, an average peripapillary RNFL (retinal nerve fiber layer) thickness was measured by means of ocular coherence tomography in MS patients. The phase delay between the arteriole and venule pulsations was assessed at three sites: in the close retinal vicinity of the disc, 1 - 2 disc diameters and 3 - 4 disc diameters away from the disc. Assuming that venules are counterphased to the choroidal circulation, a choroid-to-retina <b>pulse</b> <b>delay</b> was calculated. RESULTS: The choroid-to-retina <b>pulse</b> <b>delay</b> was 0. 26 +/- 0. 11, 0. 27 +/- 0. 13 and 0. 34 +/- 0. 15 sec in eyes with history of optic neuritis (ON-eyes); in eyes of MS patients without such a history (non-ON eyes) the corresponding values were 0. 27 +/- 0. 14, 0. 29 +/- 0. 11 and 0. 30 +/- 0. 15 sec, and in control eyes 0. 32 +/- 0. 19, 0. 38 +/- 0. 16 and 0. 45 +/- 0. 20 sec, respectively, at three sites centrifugal from the disc. The choroid-to-retina <b>pulse</b> <b>delay</b> was significantly longer in healthy control eyes than both in ON eyes (p = 0. 012) and non-ON eyes of MS patients (p = 0. 004). The interocular difference of the choroid-to-retina <b>pulse</b> <b>delay</b> and OCT RNFL thickness showed a significant correlation in MS patients (Pearson r = 0. 54, p = 0. 015; Spearman R = 0. 66, p = 0. 0016). CONCLUSION: Patients with multiple sclerosis seem to demonstrate an increased rigidity of the retinal vessels. The interocular difference in retinal vessel rigidity was significantly correlated with the interocular difference in RNFL thickness in MS patients...|$|E

The Fano type interference effect and spectral hole burning appears in the {{the dynamics of the}} absorption-dispersion spectra caused by the joint nonlinear coherence Kerr effect and Doppler broadening. The coherent Kerr effect exhibits an enhancement (reduction) in superluminal (subluminal) in negative (in positive) group index while the Doppler broadening generates multiple hole burning in the Autler-Townes like spectra of this system. The hole burning in addition with coherent Kerr effect on the spectral profile influences the dynamics of subluminal and superluminal of the probe pulse through the medium. The characteristics of superluminality and subluminality modified by considering cold-Kerr-free medium and hot-Kerr-dependent mediums.

40|$|To realize {{high quality}} X-ray optical {{multilayer}} stacks on large areas a double-beam PLD-source was {{integrated into a}} commercial MBE system. Optimization of ablation conditions and film growth regime, resp., for various kinds of homogeneous thin films and multilayer systems has been realized by a reproducible variation of pulse energy and repetition rate {{of each of the}} two Nd:YAG-lasers. In addition the lasers can be independently controlled by a predetermined <b>pulse</b> <b>delay.</b> Thus plasma parameters of two plumes generated from locally separated origins can be influenced by the <b>pulse</b> <b>delay</b> of the Nd:YAG-lasers, too. The influence of laser parameters and <b>pulse</b> <b>delay</b> on thin film growth is investigated by the deposition of Ni/C layer stacks. Optimum irradiation conditions are zero delay and moderate pulse energies. Multilayer interface roughnesses on the order of sigma R about 0. 1 nm are deduced from high resolution electron microscopy (HREM) - micrographs. The interface roughness increases with higher pulse energy. For changing the <b>pulse</b> <b>delay</b> from tau= 0 ns to tau = 2. 5 ms a destruction of the layer stack is observed.

40|$|A {{comparative}} analysis of two approaches to {{description of the}} light modulation <b>pulse</b> <b>delay</b> in a saturable absorber is presented. According to the simplest model, the delay of the optical pulse {{is a result of}} distortion of its shape due to absorption self-modulation in the nonlinear medium. The second model of the effect, proposed at the beginning of our century, connects the <b>pulse</b> <b>delay</b> with the so-called "slow light" resulting from the group velocity reduction under conditions of the coherent population oscillations. It is shown that all the known experimental data on the light <b>pulse</b> <b>delay</b> in saturable absorbers can be comprehensively described in the framework of the simplest model of saturable absorber and do not require invoking the effect of coherent population oscillations with spectral hole-burning and anomalous modifications of the light group velocity. It is concluded that the effect of group velocity reduction under conditions of coherent population oscillations has not received so far any experimental confirmation, and the assertions about real observation of the "slow light" based on this mechanism are groundless. Comment: Regretfully, the journal version of the paper (in Optics and Spectroscopy) appeared to be strongly corrupted due to ignorant editing. In particular, "coherent population oscillations" (CPO) was replaced by "population coherent oscillations" (PCO), "bleaching" - by "clearing", and "bleachable absorber " - by "clearable absorber".

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that the polarization-dependent anisotropy of the laser-induced periodic surface structure (LIPSS) on silicon can be adjusted by designing a femtosecond laser pulse train (800 nm, 50 fs, 1 kHz). By varying the <b>pulse</b> <b>delay</b> from 100 to 1600 fs within a double pulse train to reduce the deposited pulse energy, which weakens the directional surface plasmon polarition (SPP) -laser energy coupling based on the initial formed ripple structure, the polarization-dependent geometrical morphology of the LIPSS evolves from a nearly isotropic circular shape to a somewhat elongated elliptical shape. Meanwhile, the controllable anisotropy of the two-dimensional scanned-line widths with different directions is achieved based on a certain <b>pulse</b> <b>delay</b> combined with the scanning speed.
