30|$|The {{numerical}} modelling of pile penetration into stiff clays, where the pile was pre-drilled {{to a depth}} of 18  m and only the last hammer blows were simulated,was presented by Mabsout and Tassoulas (1994). Soon afterward, a special finite element analysis technique called “zipper-type” was successfully used to simulate the pile installation process. In this modelling technique, a reserved hole with a diameter of 1  % of the pile diameter was simulated in the axis of penetration. This reserve hole was able to expand so that the contact between the soils and pile was established in the penetration process of sleeve. To analyze the soil plugging effect in the open-end <b>pipe</b> <b>pile,</b> Henke and Grabe (2008) developed the {{numerical modelling}} of driving open-end <b>pipe</b> <b>pile</b> into soils using the “zipper-type” technique. In their model, a rigid tube of 1  mm wall thickness was created along the open-end <b>pipe</b> <b>pile</b> wall, it penetrated throughout the whole soil layer. Before penetration of pile, the interaction between the <b>pipe</b> <b>pile</b> and soils was assumed to be frictionless. During pile penetration, the <b>pipe</b> <b>pile</b> slided over the rigid tube, and separated the soils from rigid tube. By taking this method, the contact between the driven pile and surrounding soils could be established. The Coulomb friction model was used throughout all analyses for the contact. Due to the full penetration of the rigid tube, the soils {{at the bottom of the}} <b>pipe</b> <b>pile</b> couldn’t plug into the <b>pipe</b> <b>pile,</b> which produced a certain influence on the result of soil plugging. This paper simulates the vibratory driving of sleeve, and a rigid tube with a thickness of 1  mm is modelled along the sleeve wall to allow penetration of sleeve (Fig.  1). However, the length of the rigid tube in this model is the same as that of the sleeve, which does not penetrate throughout the whole layer. As the sleeve is being driven, the soils at the bottom of the rigid tube can plug into the sleeve. Therefore, numerical modelling can provide a more precise simulation of the soil plug.|$|E

40|$|The {{interpretation}} of low-strain integrity testing performed on piles is commonly based on methods {{developed from the}} onedimensional wave propagation theory. However, stress waves generated from {{the impact of the}} hammer on the head of a <b>pipe</b> <b>pile</b> propagate not only along the vertical, but also the circumferential and radial directions. One-dimensional methods that ignore these waves may underestimate the amplitude of the incident wave, and fail to predict the development of high-frequency interferences that may compromise the assessment of the integrity, particularly of large-diameter pipe piles. To account for these three-dimensional effects, the authors formulate a solution for determining the vertical vibration response along the cross-section of the <b>pipe</b> <b>pile</b> head to an impact load, which robustly accounts for coupling of <b>pipe</b> <b>pile</b> and viscoelastic soil vibrations. Presentation of the method is followed by a discussion on identifying the mechanisms that underlie body and surface stress-wave propagation along the section of the <b>pipe</b> <b>pile</b> head, and the conditions under which these may undermine the {{interpretation of}} pile integrity tests with conventional one-dimensional methods.

This paper deals with this squeezing effect of open-ended pipe piles using the cylindrical cavity expansion theory. The characteristics of soil with different tension and compression moduli and dilation are involved by applying the elastic theory with different moduli and logarithmic strain. The closed-form solutions of the radius of the plastic region, the displacement of {{the boundary between the}} plastic region and the elastic region and the expansion pressure on the external surface of the pipe piles are obtained. When obtaining these solutions, the soil plug in the open-ended <b>pipe</b> <b>pile</b> is considered by employing an incremental filling ratio to quantify the degree of soil plugging. Moreover, the effects of the ratio of tension and compression moduli, angle of dilation and incremental filling ratio on the radius of the plastic region and the expansion pressure on the external surface of the <b>pipe</b> <b>pile</b> are investigated.

40|$|Impact driving {{technique}} {{is commonly used}} in offshore environments to install pipe piles. This technique consists in striking the pile head with a hammer to reach the required installation depth. The quest for offshore wind energy demands that <b>pipe</b> <b>pile</b> foundations be installed in increasingly challenging geotechnical conditions. To reach final installation depth, the pile has now to be driven through very dense soil with high resistance and even into rock layers. This increases the difficulty of pile driving while avoiding its damage during hammering. The objective of this thesis is to portray stresses in a <b>pipe</b> <b>pile</b> during driving into rock layer and to assess the structural integrity of the pile toe. An analytical approach has been attempted first {{to solve the problem}} for the static case. On one hand, an original analytical solution of a <b>pipe</b> <b>pile</b> subjected to non-axial static loading has been developed based on the Airy stress function. This solution gave results approaching those of Boussinesq’s plane strain solution for the case of large diameters. On the other hand, two novel closed-form solutions for cylindrical and spherical cavity expansion in a rock mass governed by a particular case of the Hoek-Brown yield criterion were developed and validated numerically. Two numerical methods were implemented to simulate dynamic <b>pipe</b> <b>pile</b> driving into rock: the Lagrangian method consisting in an axisymmetric modelling based on the “zipper type” technique and the Coupled Eulerian Lagrangian method (CEL- 3 D). Stresses in tubular piles during impact driving were evaluated, allowing the structural integrity of the pile toe to be assessed. To validate the proposed numerical models, a 1 g reduced scale model was built, featuring different synthetic rock resistances. The developed experimental model is able to simulate <b>pipe</b> <b>pile</b> driving into rock. Comparison between numerical simulations (CEL- 3 D) and experimental tests showed similar results in terms of strains at the pile toe level. Based on numerical simulations and experimental results, the following conclusions can be drawn: • The power form of the Extended Drucker-Prager yield criterion can emulate the mechanical behaviour of rock mass governed by the Hoek-Brown yield criterion. • The “zipper-type” {{technique is}} applicable to quasi-static cone penetration into dense sand and fully coring penetration of <b>pipe</b> <b>pile</b> undergoing driving. • <b>Pipe</b> <b>pile</b> driving into good quality rock mass (σc> 20 MPa) entails a significant risk of damaging the pile toe; the use of high steel grade is recommended.
