40|$|Over {{the past}} 20 years, the federal {{government}} and uni-versities across Canada have directed resources towards the development of university-based health <b>promotion</b> research <b>centres.</b> Researchers at health <b>promotion</b> research <b>centres</b> in Canada have produced peer-reviewed papers and policy documents based on their work, but no publi-cations have emerged that focus on the specific roles of the health <b>promotion</b> research <b>centres</b> themselves. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to propose a framework, based on an in-depth examination of one centre, to help identify the unique roles of health <b>promotion</b> research <b>centres</b> and to clarify the value they add to promoting health and advancing university goals. Considering the shifting federal discourse on health promotion over time and the vulnerability of social and health sciences to changes in research funding priorities, health <b>promotion</b> research <b>centres</b> in Canada and elsewhere may need to articulate their unique roles and contributions in order to maintain a critical focus on health promotion research. The authors briefly describe the Atlantic Health <b>Promotion</b> Research <b>Centre</b> (AHPRC), propose a framework that illustrates six essential roles of health <b>promotion</b> research <b>centres</b> and describe the policy contexts and challenges of health pro-motion research centres. The analysis of research and knowledge translation activities over 15 years at AHPRC sheds light on the roles that health <b>promotion</b> research <b>centres</b> play in applied research. The conclusion raises questions regarding the value of university-based research centres and challenges to their sustainability.
