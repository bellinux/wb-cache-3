The British infantry and Home Guard had little with which to put up a fight against tanks and to any who had witnessed trials of Molotov Cocktails and SIP grenades it was evident that they could do little to a modern tank other than to provide a blinding <b>pall</b> <b>of</b> <b>smoke.</b> What was needed was a hand weapon to deliver a coup de grâce by punching through the armoured plate. The sticky bomb could do the job and little else was available.|$|E
5|$|At 02:00 on 13 November, two squadrons of ship's boats made amphibious landings: a small force under Lieutenant Samuel Leslie landed to {{the north}} of the emplaced positions, acting as a {{diversion}} while the main body of the expeditionary force landed to the south under Lieutenant Colonel Smith. Leslie's diversion distracted the Arab defenders, but enough remained in the southern defences to make a significant counterattack on Smith's beachhead. Cannon fire from the ship's boats covering the landing drove the Arabs back, and Smith ordered his men to advance with their bayonets fixed, pushing into the town and driving out the Arabs house by house. To cover their advance, Smith's men set fire to the buildings in their path, which created a <b>pall</b> <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> under cover of which Smith was able to storm and capture the Sheik's palace.|$|E

2500|$|At such a distance, Hezlet {{had to make}} precise estimable {{calculations}} {{before his}} chance of an attack disappeared.

Because of the shoreline to port Ashigara could only alter toward Trenchant and that meant running into the torpedoes. After three minutes five torpedoes struck Ashigara. Trenchants company queued to view through the search periscope, but the periscope attracted anti-aircraft fire from Ashigara. Hezlet then turned Trenchant to bring her stern tubes to bear and fired two more torpedoes nearly an hour after first sighting the cruiser. Torpedoes fired by Ashigara at Trenchants periscope missed, but a fire caused by the first hits had spread rapidly through Ashigara causing a huge <b>pall</b> <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> to obscure Hezlet's view.|$|E
30|$|Air quality poses one of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} for managers of wildland fire use programs. Fires that burn for weeks or even months cast <b>palls</b> <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> in inhabited areas and can cause air quality standards to be violated. Active measures to manage smoke will have to be taken. For example, Yosemite National Park has extinguished many candidate lightning fires in the wildland fire use zone because another fire was already burning in the same airshed. Land management agencies must work with the Environmental Protection Agency and local air pollution control boards to inform them about the importance of wildland fire use programs for meeting land management objectives.|$|R

50|$|Meanwhile, Nathanael Greene's {{column on}} Limekiln Road had {{finally caught up}} with the bulk of the Americans at Germantown. Greene's vanguard engaged the British pickets at Luken's Mill, driving them back after a savage skirmish.

One of Greene's brigades, under Brigadier General Adam Stephen, veered off-course and began following Meetinghouse Road, instead of rendezvousing at Market Square with the rest of Greene's troops. The wayward brigade collided with Wayne's brigade, and mistook them for redcoats. The two American brigades opened fire on each other in the fog, causing both to flee. The withdrawal of Wayne's New Jersey Brigade, having suffered heavy losses attacking Cliveden, left Conway's right flank exposed.|$|R
2500|$|By 18:30, {{the main}} battle fleet action was joined {{for the first}} time, with Jellicoe {{effectively}} [...] "crossing Scheer's T". The officers on the lead German battleships, and Scheer himself, were taken completely by surprise when they emerged from drifting clouds of smoky mist to suddenly find themselves facing the massed firepower of the entire Grand Fleet main battle line, which {{they did not know}} was even at sea. Jellicoe's flagship Iron Duke quickly scored seven hits on the lead German dreadnought, [...] but in this brief exchange, which lasted only minutes, as few as 10 of the Grand Fleet's 24 dreadnoughts actually opened fire. The Germans were hampered by poor visibility, in addition to being in an unfavourable tactical position, just as Jellicoe had intended. Realising he was heading into a death trap, Scheer ordered his fleet to turn and disengage at 18:33. Under a <b>pall</b> <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> and mist, Scheer's forces succeeded in disengaging by an expertly executed 180° turn in unison ("battle about turn to starboard", German Gefechtskehrtwendung nach Steuerbord), which was a well-practised emergency manoeuvre of the High Seas Fleet.

2500|$|If the British {{could take}} the Borguebus ridge, {{the way to the}} plains of {{northern}} France would be wide open, and potentially Paris could be taken, which explains the ferocity with which the Germans defended the Borguebus ridge.

At 1212, the cruiser joined the battleships in firing on the iron works and warehouses. Although heavy smoke obscured the target from the cruiser's spotting planes, the combination of pre-plotting the target through photo reconnaissance and radar positioning data allowed Chicagos guns to start fires in numerous buildings, several large warehouses, and among nearby oil tanks. At 1251, the cruiser's secondary battery guns began firing on a Japanese destroyer-escort type vessel. The escort was straddled and hit by 5 in shell fire, began smoking, and retired into the harbor.
