It was slated to be demolished, but Ms. Hendrickson rallied supporter to the save the house after uncovering its history. A restoration and rehabilitation project was completed in 1994 and it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.

They were married in July 1928, and their only child, Gudrun, was born on 8 August 1929. The couple were also foster parents to a boy named Gerhard von Ahe, son of an SS officer who had died before the war. Margarete sold her share of the clinic and used the proceeds to buy a plot of land in Waldtrudering, near Munich, where they erected a <b>prefabricated</b> <b>house.</b> Himmler was constantly away on party business, so his wife took charge of their efforts—mostly unsuccessful—to raise livestock for sale.

40|$|<b>Prefabricated</b> <b>houses</b> {{have been}} at the {{forefront}} for the delivery of buildings with less onsite construction time and safer for the workers. Significant savings in terms of cost and reducing waste are some of the primary direct benefits. In addition, other direct positive impacts such as higher quality can be easily achieved due to improvements in terms of processes offsite. However, indirect benefits of <b>prefabricated</b> <b>houses</b> are not still well defined and quantified. The consideration of wider economic benefits (WEBs) would provide the opportunity to quantify the value which is useful for decision-making. Urban renewal and growth, commercial activity influx, and employment opportunities are the examples of WEBs due to the <b>prefabricated</b> <b>houses</b> industry.

40|$|The {{current state}} of the <b>prefabricated</b> <b>housing</b> market in Australia is {{systematically}} profiled, guided by a theoretical systems model. Particular focus is given to two original data collections. The first identifies manufacturers and builders using prefabrication innovations, and the second compares the context for <b>prefabricated</b> <b>housing</b> in Australia with that of key international jurisdictions. The results indicate a small but growing market for <b>prefabricated</b> <b>housing</b> in Australia, often building upon expertise developed through non-residential building applications. The international comparison highlighted the complexity of the interactions between macro policy decisions and historical influences and the uptake of <b>prefabricated</b> <b>housing.</b> The data suggest factors such as the small scale of the Australian market, and a lack of investment in research, development and training have not encouraged prefabrication. A lack of clear regulatory policy surrounding <b>prefabricated</b> <b>housing</b> is common both in Australia and internationally, with local effects in regards to home warranties and housing finance highlighted. Future research should target the continuing lack of consideration of prefabrication from within the housing construction industry, and build upon the research reported in this paper to further quantify the potential end user market and the continuing development of the industry...|$|R
