40|$|The {{efficacy}} of several fungicides based on sulphur, propiconazole, kresoxim-methyl and <b>pyrazophos</b> was examined under production conditions and on scions in Podgorica environs over three successive years (2002, 2003 and 2004). The experiments were conducted based on EPPO methodology (1997) and data statistically processed. Infestation with grape powdery mildew {{was found to}} be more intensive under production conditions than on scions in each year of investigation. The heaviest infestation was on the bunches and than on shoots and leaves. The most evident difference in fungicide efficacy was also found on the bunches. Kresoxim-methyl demonstrated the highest average efficacy. Propiconazole was highly effective, while the {{efficacy of}} <b>pyrazophos</b> and sulphur was lower, and the intensity of disease, compared to control, was very significantly lower in statistical terms...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn {{approach}} {{based on}} solid–phase microextraction-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPME-LC-MS) {{has been developed}} for determining 12 insecticides (bromophos ethyl, chlorpyrifos methyl, chlorpyrifos ethyl, diazinon, fenoxycarb, fonofos, phenthoate, phosalone, pirimiphos methyl, profenofos, <b>pyrazophos,</b> and temephos) in honey. The influence of several parameters in {{the efficiency of the}} SPME was systematically investigated. In optimal conditions, the developed procedure provided an excellent linearity (> 0. 990), detection and quantification limits (between 0. 001 and 0. 1 µg g- 1 and between 0. 005 and 0. 5 µg g- 1, respectively), and precision (< 19 % at the quantification limits and from 6 to 14 % at ten times higher concentrations). However, recoveries are not so good ranging from 19 to 92 %. Honey samples contaminated with bromophos ethyl, diazinon, phonophos, pirimiphos ethyl, <b>pyrazophos</b> and temephos were found; estimated concentration were from 6. 2 ± 1. 2 to 19 ± 3 ng g- 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} various {{fungicide}} treatments of seeds and leaves of rice {{on the development}} of the pathogenic fungi Pyricularia grisea and Helminthosporium oryzae was studied. When applied to seeds, tricyclazole, mancozeb and the carboxin+thiram combination were the only fungicides that reduced all the symptoms induced by both pathogens without damaging the development of young plants. Tricyclazole and the tricyclazole+mancozeb protected rice plants against P. grisea and H. oryzae respectively throughout the vegetative phase. To ensure protection during the entire vegetative phase, <b>pyrazophos</b> should be applied every two weeks while the carboxin+thiram combination, thiabendazole and mancozeb should be applied every week...|$|E
40|$|On ten {{sites in}} the "Westland", an area used for {{glasshouse}} agriculture situated sout-west of The Hague, samples of surface water have been taken monthly during the period july 1989 - april 1990. These samples were investigated {{for the presence of}} 79 pesticides and related substances, and for cholinesterase inhibition, a sumparameter. A total of 40 compounds was found. Two of these 40 compounds, desethyl-atrazin and desisopropyl-atrazin, could not be evaluated ecotoxicologically due to lack of data. Indicative Maximum Acceptable Risk Levels (MAR's) have been exceeded one or several times for 24 of the 40 compounds. For 4 compounds, dichlorvos, mevinphos, parathion-ethyl and <b>pyrazophos,</b> the indicative MAR's have been exceeded a factor of more than 100, in one or more cases. For aldicarb-sulfoxide, cyanazin, malathion and triazophos, indicative MAR's have been exceeded a factor of more than 100, in one or more cases. For 16 out of the 40 compounds that were found, the indicative MAR was exceeded in all cases that the compound was present in a sample. The values "Kwaliteitsdoelstelling 2000 " given in the "Derde Nota Waterhuishouding" have been exceeded for 11 compounds. For diazinon, dichlorvos, malathion, mevinphos, parathion-ethyl, <b>pyrazophos</b> and triazophos this value was exceeded in all cases that the compound was present in a sample. Compared to the results of the 1988 / 1989 program, there is a slight increase in the average number of times that pesticides are found in a sample. However, the percentage of values that exceed the indicative MAR has not increased much. ...|$|E
40|$|Fungicides {{are widely}} used in agriculture, and {{released}} in large amounts to the environment. Methods used for antifungal susceptibility testing are cumbersome and time-consuming. As a result, very {{little attention has been}} paid to including fungal tests in the routine screening of pesticides and there are no reports in the literature of fungicide focussed effects directed analysis (EDA). In addition very little is known on the toxicity of fungicides to environmentally significant fungi. Here we report a rapid microplate-based resorufin fluorescence inhibition bioassay and compare it with a 24 h microplate-based yeast growth inhibition bioassay using eight fungicides. The growth inhibition bioassay was sensitive, giving IC 50 and IC 90 values comparable to previously reported IC 50 or MICs of these fungicides for Saccharomyces cerevisiae and other fungi. The resorufin fluorescence inhibition bioassay was both faster and more sensitive than the growth inhibition bioassay. Inhibitory concentrations obtained just after 30 min of incubation with amphotericin B (AMB) and captan were at least a hundred fold lower than IC 50 s in the literature for fungi. The fluorescence bioassay showed only a small response to <b>pyrazophos</b> and thiabendazole but these only inhibited growth at high concentrations so this may reflect low sensitivity of S. cerevisiae to these particular fungicides. This bioassay can detect toxic effects of a range of fungicides from different chemical classes with different modes of action. It will be valuable for screening chemical libraries for fungicides and as a biomarker for detecting the effects of fungicides to non-target fungi...|$|E
40|$|Ergosterol {{biosynthesis}} inhibitors (EBIs) have {{a remarkably}} {{broad spectrum of}} antifungal activity. They belong to the commercial fungicides which exhibit the highest activity known to date. Resistance to EBIs was found in vitro, but the level of resistance and the decreased fitness of resistant strains led to the hypothesis that resistance to EBIs was rather unlikely to develop in practice. Despite the fact that EBIs were introduced as early as 1972, up to 1980 only data on EBI-resistant laboratory strains were available. However, gradually there appeared reports on decreased sensitivity to EBIs in practice. This made it of interest to investigate the potential development of resistance to EBIs in vivo. In this study the pathogen used to gather the desired information was Sphaerotheca fuliginea, as this fungus is widespread in cucumber glasshouses in the Netherlands, intensively controlled with fungicides and resistance-prone. This thesis contains five papers describing several aspects of resistance to fungicides in S. fuliginea. In the first paper {{it has been shown}} that S. fuliginea is present on cucumber plants all year round. A gradual increase in the number of infected crops, in the form of S-shaped curves, was observed from planting until May. In the districts with the highest crop density (Pijnacker), mildew was generally observed early in the growing season, while the apparent rate of increase of infected crops was higher than in other districts. In the district with the lowest crop density (Northern Netherlands), mildew was observed late in the growing season and the apparent rate of increase of infected crops was low. Early in the growing season the pathogen is probably dispersed by transportation of infected planting stock and by man. When the disease pressure increases, inoculum is probably dispersed by wind. This implies that inoculum is highly mobile and that, in the case of development of resistance to fungicides, the resistant strains will disperse to crops where the spray regime did not cause resistance to develop. As S. fuliginea developed resistance to dimethirimol, benzimidazoles and <b>pyrazophos</b> in 1971, 1972 and 1979, respectively, it was thought that presence of strains resistant to these fungicides might provide information on the long-term fitness of these strains. The results of an investigation are presented in the second paper. Strains resistant to these fungicides still persisted in the pathogen population. Although this finding may indicate that the long-term fitness of these strains is equal to that of wild-type strains, several other factors might be involved in the persistence of resistance. From 1981 to 1984, S. fuliginea in the Netherlands was primarily controlled with EBIs. The short-term fitness of isolates of S. fuliginea resistant to EBIs and their behaviour under practical conditions are described in the third, fourth and fifth paper. Several fitness parameters of EBI-resistant isolates collected from commercial glasshouses were compared to those of isolates with a wild-type sensitivity to EBIs. Fitness parameters studied were germination of conidia, growth of germ tubes and mycelium, penetration, sporulation and competitive ability. The results are described in the third paper. One or more values of fitness parameters for EBI-resistant isolates were significantly lower than those for the wild-type isolates. However, in general it was concluded that the fitness of EBI-resistant S. fuliginea isolates, collected in commercial glasshouses, was hardly reduced. Within the group of EBI-resistant isolates tested no significant relation was observed between the degree of resistance to EBIs and the degree of fitness. In the fourth and fifth paper the resistance to EBIs of S. fuliginea over a three-year period has been described. In 1981 the sensitivity of glasshouse isolates to EBIs was lower than that of the wild-type isolates. In 1982 and 1983 the sensitivity decreased further. In 1984, no significant differences in sensitivity with the 1983 level were apparent. Per district, the degree of resistance appeared to be positively correlated to the frequency of application of EBIs. Isolates collected in the district of Limburg, where EBIs were applied less frequently than in the district of Pijnacker, showed a significantly higher sensitivity to EBIs than isolates collected in Pijnacker. Triforine showed a very low efficacy in controlling glasshouse isolates. This is in accordance with the experience of growers who, therefore, only use triforine when the disease pressure is low. It is concluded that the decreased sensitivity to triforine can be regarded as resistance. In the case of bitertanol, fenarimol and imazalil, a change to shorter spray intervals has up till now been sufficient to achieve proper control. Contrary to earlier presumptions that development of resistance to EBIs seemed rather unlikely, it gradually developed in normal commercial practice. The slowly decreasing sensitivity to EBIs of cereal powdery mildew is in line with the results described in this thesis. Strategies to delay resistance to EBIs are necessary. Alternation with other site-specific and multi-site fungicides must be advised and can be applied immediately. Non-EBI fungicides are registered for control of cucumber powdery mildew in the Netherlands. Appropriate information and guidance by extension officers and fungicide manufacturers may lower the reluctance of growers to use these strategies. In the long run, control of S. fuliginea might only be maintained by a form of integrated control, which accepts less than perfect disease control. Biological and chemical control, induced resistance of cucumber plants, epidermal coating and mildew-tolerant cucumber cultivars are elements that may fit into a strategy for integrated control of cucumber powdery mildew...|$|E
