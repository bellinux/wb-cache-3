"I {{am ready}} to stroll," [...] said Mrs. Petter, {{in a tone that}} showed she had been a good deal stirred by her companion's remarks, [...] "but I am not going to stroll over that way. The place is big enough for people to keep to themselves, if they choose, and I am one that chooses, and I choose to walk in the {{direction}} of my duty, or, more properly, the duty of somebody else, and see that the hen-houses are shut"; and, taking Lanigan's arm, she marched him down to the barn, and then across a small orchard to the most distant <b>poultry-house</b> within the limits of the estate.|$|E

Other poultry-yards in the neighbourhood also suffered.--Pilfering was housebreaking to Mr. Woodhouse's fears.--He was very uneasy; and but for the sense of his son-in-law's protection, would have been under wretched alarm every night of his life. The strength, resolution, and presence of mind of the Mr. Knightleys, commanded his fullest dependence. While either of them protected him and his, Hartfield was safe.--But Mr. John Knightley must be in London again {{by the end of the}} first week in November.|$|E

60|$|In these Works {{all sorts}} of {{articles}} are manufactured {{to be used by}} other branches of the Salvation Army. Thus I saw <b>poultry-houses</b> being made for the Boxted Small Holdings; these cost from £4 5s. to £4 10s. net, and were excellent structures designed to hold about two dozen fowls. Further on large numbers of seats of different patterns were in process of manufacture, some of them for children, and other longer ones, with reversible backs, {{to be used in the}} numerous Army halls. Next I visited a room in which mattresses and mattress covers are made for the various Shelters, also the waterproof bunk bedding, which costs 7s. 9d. per cover. Further on, in a separate compartment, was a flock-tearing machine, at which the Mormon I have mentioned was employed. This is a very dusty job whereat a man does not work for more than one day in ten.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{examined}} socio economic characteristics of contracted turkey farms in Turkey. Results reeval that young labor force and literacy rate were at sufficient level. Although main production activity on farms was contracted turkey breeding, plant production, plant production, cattle, {{sheep and goats}} breeding were other activities carried out. While 83. 98 % of farm land under farm property, 16. 02 % of that was used as rented and shared land. Grain production had the highest share in plant production. The number of turkeys, large and small animals was, respectively 4845, 3. 38 and 0. 32 heads in average farm. Tractors were present on 40. 82 % of farms. While the share of variable cost in production cost, respectively, belong to heating (16. 51 %), lightening(15. 87 %) and pad(12. 11 %) cost. On the other hand, the highest shares in fixed cost, respectively, belong to <b>poultry-house</b> depreciationi (10. 17 %), <b>poultry-house</b> interest(10. 17 %) and parmanent labor expenses(6. 81 %). Gross production value, gross income, and net income were, respectively, found as 6428. 35 $/year, 3083. 18 /year and 1293. 91 $/year. Duration of contracted turkey breeding of farms was on average 2. 63 periods. The most important factors causing to run a contracted turkey firm was price and sale guarantee. However, not having any influence in determining buying price of turkeys {{was the most important}} problem of farms. Eventough 63. 27 % of farms were not satisfied income obtained from turkey breeding, 83. 67 % of farms stated tht they will have maintained turkey breeding due to guaranteed income depending on marketing guarantee and input provision...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The 2002 – 2003 Exotic Newcastle Disease (END) {{outbreak}} in Southern California poultry pro-vided {{an opportunity to}} evaluate environmental air sampling as an efficient and cost-effective means of sampling flocks for detection of a circulating virus. Exotic Newcastle Disease virus was detected by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR from air samples collected using a wetted-wall cyclone-style air sampler placed within 2 m of birds in 2 commercial flocks suspected of being naturally exposed to END virus during the outbreak. Exotic Newcastle Disease virus was detected after 2 hours of air sampling the <b>poultry-house</b> environments of the 2 naturally infected flocks. Key words: Air sampler; environmental sampling; Exotic Newcastle Disease Virus; RT-PCR. Avian paramyxovirus is an approximately 150 – 300 nm, enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus. The avian paramyxovirus group includes Exotic Newcastle Disease (END) virus, the highly contagious virus affecting multiple avian species and associated with a. $ 160 million federal emergency response in Southern California and 2 adjoining states from Sep...|$|E
