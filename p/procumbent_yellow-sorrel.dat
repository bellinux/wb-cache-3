50|$|Oxalis corniculata, the {{creeping}} woodsorrel, {{also called}} <b>procumbent</b> <b>yellow-sorrel</b> or sleeping beauty, resembles the common yellow woodsorrel, Oxalis stricta. It is a somewhat delicate-appearing, low-growing, herbaceous {{plant in the}} family Oxalidaceae. It has a narrow, creeping stem that readily roots at the nodes. The trifoliate leaves are subdivided into three rounded leaflets and resemble a clover in shape. Some varieties have green leaves, while others, like Oxalis corniculata var. atropurpurea, have purple. The leaves have inconspicuous stipules {{at the base of}} each petiole.|$|E
