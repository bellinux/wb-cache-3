50|$|Polygonum aviculare or common {{knotgrass}} is a plant {{related to}} buckwheat and dock. It is also called <b>prostrate</b> <b>knotweed,</b> birdweed, pigweed and lowgrass. It is an annual found in fields and wasteland, with white flowers from June to October. It is widespread across {{many countries in}} temperate regions, apparently native to Eurasia and North America, naturalized in temperate parts of the Southern Hemisphere.|$|E
50|$|Polygonum arenastrum, {{commonly}} known as equal-leaved knotgrass,is a summer annual flowering plant in the knotweed family Polygonaceae. It is native to Europe {{and can be found}} on other continents as an introduced species and a common noxious weed. Other common names include common knotweed, <b>prostrate</b> <b>knotweed,</b> mat grass, oval-leaf knotweed, stone grass, wiregrass, and door weed, as well as many others, knotweed was first seen in North America in 1809 and is now seen across much of the United States and Canada.|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} from 1981 - 1983 {{to determine the}} efficacy and phytotoxicity of postemergence herbicides used to control broadleaf weeds in spring-planted barley. The following herbicides were evaluated: MCPA amine (0. 37, 0. 75, 1. 5 lb/A, active ingredient), 2, 4 -D amine (0. 25, 0. 5, 1 lb/A), bromoxynil (0. 21, 0. 43, 0. 86 lb/A), and metribuzin (0. 11, 0. 21, 0. 43, 0. 86 lb/A). In 1982 and 1983, three additional herbicides were included: dinoseb (0. 25, 0. 5, 1 Ib/A), dicamba (0. 09, 0. 18, 0. 36 lb/A), and chlorsulfuron (0. 04, 0. 07, 0. 14 lb/A). Weed control was determined through measurements of weed biomass in each herbicide and control plot. Phytotoxicity was measured by barley yield and test weight in all years, and additionally by germination of seed produced in 1982. None of the herbicides except dicamba in 1982 significantly reduced the yield or test weights of barley below that of the control. Common lambsquarters was the only weed present in 1981 and 1982. Bromoxynil and metribuzin provided both early-and late-season control MCPA, 2, 4 -D, and [...] j dinoseb took longer to control common lambsquarters but provided adequate control by midseason. Dicamba did not control common lambsquarters {{as well as the}} other herbicides. In 1983, <b>prostrate</b> <b>knotweed</b> was also present at the study site. None of the herbicides significantly reduced the number of <b>prostrate</b> <b>knotweed</b> below that of the control Germination of 'Galt' barley was not [...] affected by treating parent plants with any of the herbicides tested. The following barley varieties were screened for susceptibility to metribuzin injury in 1982 : Galt, Lidal, Weal, Otal, Datal, Eero, Paavo, Otra, and Klondike.

40|$|Field {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the effects of organic and inorganic amendments on weed suppression in sweet maize cultivation (Zea mays L.). A randomized complete block design was employed with four replicates per treatment with each organic amendment used at half (x/ 2), single (x= 10 t ha(- 1)) and double (2 x) rates (organic fertilization: cow manure, poultry manure and barley mulch; synthetic fertilizer (240 kg N ha(- 1) : 21 - 0 - 0); and control). The highest number and dry weight of weeds were recorded for double cow manure and chemical fertilizer treatments. The cow manure treatments promoted weed emergence and growth proportionally to the rate of application (x/ 2 <x< 2 x). In the presence of barley residues, weed biomass or density was reduced for the species: redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.), common purslane (Portulaca oleracea L.) and <b>prostrate</b> <b>knotweed</b> (Polygonum aviculare L.). Weed suppressive effect of barley residues decreased with time following residue decomposition. The barley mulch plots presented the highest values of Shannon-Weiner and Simpson indices. These results indicate that green manure of barley are effective for the suppression of some weeds in sweet maize...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to quantify the density and abundance of weeds in wheat fields of South Khorasan province during 2010 and 56 species of weed form 16 plant families were identified in 240 farms of eight towns around this province. The most families in number of species were pertaining to Poaceae, Asteraceae and Chenopodiaceae with 15 (26. 79 %), nine (16. 7 %), six (10. 71 %) and six (10. 71 %) species, respectively. The most frequencies were related to yarrow (Achilla biberstinii L.) by 37. 38 % from the Asteraceae family, hoary cress (Cardaria draba L. (form Bressicaseae family by 28. 3 % and common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.) from Chenopodiaseae family by 37. 47 %. Hoary cress, common lambs quarters, bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon L.), camelthorn and <b>prostrate</b> <b>knotweed</b> (Polygonum aviculare L.) were allocated the highest average density of the weeds with 1. 38, 1. 31, 1. 29, 1. 27 and 1. 04 plant. m- 2, respectively. The most abundant of weeds were camelthorn, common lambsquarters and yarrow.

40|$|Field experiments, {{conducted}} from 1991 to 1994, generated {{information on}} weed seedbank emergence for 22 site-years from Ohio to Colorado and Minnesota to Missouri. Early spring seedbank densities were estimated through direct extraction of viable seeds from soil cores. Emerged seedlings were recorded periodically, as were daily values for air and soil temperature, and precipitation. Percentages of weed seedbanks that emerged as seedlings were calculated from seedbank and seedling data for each species, and relationships between seedbank emergence and microclimatic variables were sought. Fifteen species {{were found in}} 3 or more site-years. Average emergence percentages (and coefficients of variation) of these species were as follows: giant foxtail, 31. 2 (84 %); velvetleaf, 28. 2 (66); kochia, 25. 7 (79); Pennsylvania smartweed, 25. 1 (65); common purslane, 15. 4 (135); common ragweed, 15. 0 (110); green foxtail, 8. 5 (72); wild proso millet, 6. 6 (104); hairy nightshade, 5. 2 (62); common sunflower, 5. 0 (26); yellow foxtail, 3. 4 (67); pigweed species, 3. 3 (103); common lambsquarters, 2. 7 (111); wild buckwheat, 2. 5 (63), and <b>prostrate</b> <b>knotweed,</b> 0. 6 (79). Variation among site-years, for some species, {{could be attributed to}} microclimate variables thought to induce secondary dormancy in spring. For example, total seasonal emergence percentage of giant foxtail was related positively to the 1 st date at which average daily soil temperature at 5 to 10 cm soil depth reached 16 C. Thus, if soil warmed before mid April, secondary dormancy was induced and few seedlings emerged, whereas many seedlings emerged if soil remained cool until June...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} study the effect of plant density, {{planting}} pattern and herbicide dosage of nicosulfuron, a field experiment was arranged in a factorial split plot treatments based on RCBD with three replications in Chenaran, Khorasan Razavi, in 2010. The experimental treatments consisted of a factorial plant density (100000, 120000 and 140000 plants ha- 1) in the planting pattern (single and double row) as main plot and herbicide dosage of nicousulforon in four levels (0, 1, 1 / 5 and 2, l. ha- 1) as sub-plot. Samplings were made at in five stages (37 days after the emergence of corn and it was repeated once per 20 days). The results indicated reducing the weed density and dry matter of weeds {{in the first stage}} after the herbicide treatment. Moreover, it was observed a significant interaction effect between plant density with planting pattern and between planting pattern with herbicides dosages during growth season on reducing weed density and dry matter. Also results indicated that in between of this experiment's treatments, nicosulfuron herbicide reduced weed density at the beginning of growth season and double row planting pattern suppressed weed density during growing season, and resulted in lowest Jacard similarity index (Sj) of weed species. Results also indicated that with increasing of plant density and herbicide dosage especially in composition of double row planting pattern, according to Shannon- Wiener index, sensitive population such as common purslane (Portulaca oleracea L.), buckhorn plantain (Plantago lanceolata L.), <b>prostrate</b> <b>knotweed</b> (Polygonum aviculareL.), black nightshade (Solanum nigrum L.) and Johnson grass (Sorghum halepens L.) was reduced in during growing season. Simpson dominance index, showed that some low populated weeds such as redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.), common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.), field bindweed (Convolvulus arvensis L.) and Canada thistle (Circum arvensis L.) persisted their growth up to the end of growing season...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1977 Pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) use of four playas (intermittent lakebeds) on Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge (NAR) {{in south}} central Oregon was studied during the summers of 1974 and 1975. Percent canopy cover of playa vegetation, plant phenology, percent {{desiccated}} vegetation, soil moisture, available surface water and pronghorn use of range sites adjacent to playas were measured for each study area; {{the relationship between these}} parameters and pronghorn use of each lakebed was determined. A total of 14, 316 pronghorn observations was recorded on the four playas during the two summers. Pronghorn observations totalled 4510 on range sites adjacent to the playas. Desert Lake received significantly (P < 0. 01) more pronghorn use than the other playas during 1974 and 1975. No significant differences in use existed among Dobyns, Long and Spanish Lakes during either study year. Pronghorns demonstrated a greater dependence on lakebeds during a dry year than during a wet year. The importance of succulent vegetation to pronghorns was reflected in the relationship between soil moisture and pronghorn use. Pronghorns indicated a strong preference for leafy arnica (Arnica foliosa), particularly at Desert Lake. On Spanish Lake during the wet year, 1975, <b>prostrate</b> <b>knotweed</b> (Polygonum aviculare) was an important pronghorn food. Other forbs eaten by pronghorns were poverty sumpweed (Iva axillaris) and Oenothera flava. As soil moisture decreased, desiccation of vegetation increased, and pronghorn use on playas increased, primarily on Desert Lake where the lowest percent desiccated vegetation occurred. Early leaf growth and early flowering stages of forbs were the most important developmental stages causing a selective response by pronghorns. Pronghorns terminated use of a lakebed if drinking water was unavailable, but the mere presence of water on a playa did not insure use. As upland range sites, dominated by low sagebrush (Artemisia arbuscula), dried, pronghorn use of playas intensified throughout summer and early fall. Patterns of use by pronghorns of range sites adjacent to playas were similar between years, but increased pronghorn use during the wet year on all sites except Desert Lake supported the idea that during the wet year pronghorns were less dependent on playa vegetation. At Desert Lake, pronghorns indicated a preference for the Intermittent Lake (fair condition) range site, dominated by Bolander's silver sagebrush (A. cana bolanderi). At the other three lakebeds, pronghorns showed a preference for Rocky Terrace (poor condition) range site. Pronghorns appeared to prefer the Desert Lake study site because of the combination of habitat factors which the other three playa sites lacked...|$|E
