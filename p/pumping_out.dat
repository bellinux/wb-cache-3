5|$|To secure phenol for aspirin production, and at {{the same}} time {{indirectly}} aid the German war effort, German agents in the United States orchestrated what became known as the Great Phenol Plot. By 1915, the price of phenol rose to the point that Bayer's aspirin plant was forced to drastically cut production. This was especially problematic because Bayer was instituting a new branding strategy in preparation of the expiry of the aspirin patent in the United States. Thomas Edison, who needed phenol to manufacture phonograph records, was also facing supply problems; in response, he created a phenol factory capable of <b>pumping</b> <b>out</b> twelve tons per day. Edison's excess phenol seemed destined for trinitrophenol production.|$|E
5|$|The only damage {{she took}} that year {{occurred}} 30 April 1943, {{while she was}} changing stations on formation, Milwaukee struck Omahas starboard bow. The collision destroyed one of her paravanes and rupturing some plating, which caused some flooding. Omahas damage control party shored up one hole with two mattresses {{and were able to}} stop the leak. One compartment was completely flooded with another compartment requiring <b>pumping</b> <b>out</b> every two hours. On Milwaukee, the 6-inch guns and torpedo tubes on her port side were unserviceable. Several holes had opened up along her port side that were above the main deck, along with some leaks under the waterline from damage to plates and rivets. Milwaukee also lost her No.3 main circulation pump. The damage was determined not to be serious enough to halt their mission and the two cruisers, after completing their patrol, put into Rio de Janeiro for the needed repairs at the Brazilian Navy Yard.|$|E
5|$|The fate {{of these}} puffs—in particular, whether they remain {{restricted}} to isolated locales or integrated into Ca2+ waves for propagation throughout the cell—is determined {{in large part}} by MAM dynamics. Although reuptake of Ca2+ by the ER (concomitant with its release) modulates the intensity of the puffs, thus insulating mitochondria to a certain degree from high Ca2+ exposure, the MAM often serves as a firewall that essentially buffers Ca2+ puffs by acting as a sink into which free ions released into the cytosol can be funneled.

The ability of mitochondria to serve as a Ca2+ sink is a result of the electrochemical gradient generated during oxidative phosphorylation, which makes tunneling of the cation an exergonic process. Normally, mild calcium influx from cytosol into the mitochondrial matrix causes transient depolarization that is corrected by <b>pumping</b> <b>out</b> protons.|$|E

25|$|Steam power – The {{improved}} {{steam engine}} invented by James Watt and patented in 1775 was initially mainly used for <b>pumping</b> <b>out</b> mines, {{but from the}} 1780s was applied to power machines.

25|$|The {{trapping}} {{mechanism of}} Utricularia is purely mechanical; no {{reaction from the}} plant (irritability) is required {{in the presence of}} prey, in contrast with the triggered mechanisms employed by Venus flytraps (Dionaea), waterwheels (Aldrovanda), and many sundews (Drosera). The only active mechanism involved is the constant <b>pumping</b> <b>out</b> of water through the bladder walls by active transport.|$|E
25|$|Pump {{and treat}} {{involves}} <b>pumping</b> <b>out</b> contaminated groundwater {{with the use}} of a submersible or vacuum pump, and allowing the extracted groundwater to be purified by slowly proceeding through a series of vessels that contain materials designed to adsorb the contaminants from the groundwater. For petroleum-contaminated sites this material is usually activated carbon in granular form. Chemical reagents such as flocculants followed by sand filters may also be used to decrease the contamination of groundwater. Air stripping is a method that can be effective for volatile pollutants such as BTEX compounds found in gasoline.|$|E

25|$|The traps {{are very}} similar, with leaves whose {{terminal}} section {{is divided into}} two lobes, hinged along the midrib. Trigger hairs (three on each lobe in Dionaea muscipula, many more in the case of Aldrovanda) inside the trap lobes are sensitive to touch. When a trigger hair is bent, stretch-gated ion channels in the membranes of cells {{at the base of the}} trigger hair open, generating an action potential that propagates to cells in the midrib. These cells respond by <b>pumping</b> <b>out</b> ions, which may either cause water to follow by osmosis (collapsing the cells in the midrib) or cause rapid acid growth. The mechanism is still debated, but in any case, changes in the shape of cells in the midrib allow the lobes, held under tension, to snap shut, flipping rapidly from convex to concave and interring the prey. This whole process takes less than a second. In the Venus flytrap, closure in response to raindrops and blown-in debris is prevented by the leaves having a simple memory: for the lobes to shut, two stimuli are required, 0.5 to 30 seconds apart.|$|E
25|$|Another {{view is that}} a stutter (stammer) is {{a complex}} tic. This view is held for the {{following}} reasons. It always arises from repetition of sounds or words. Young children like repetition and the more tense they are feeling, the more they like this outlet for their tension – an understandable and quite normal reaction. They are capable of repeating all types of behaviour. The more tension that is felt, the less one likes change. The more change, the greater can be the repetition. So, when a 3 year old finds {{he has a new}} baby brother or sister he may start repeating sounds. The repetitions can become conditioned and automatic and ensuing struggles against the repetitions result in prolongations and blocks in his speech. More boys stammer than girls, in the ratio of 3–4 boys : 1 girl. This is because the male Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis is more active. Whilst they are <b>pumping</b> <b>out</b> more cortisol than females under the same provocation, they can be tense or anxious and become repetitive.|$|E

After Karlsruhe left port, the British submarine [...] attacked the German cruiser and hit {{her with a}} pair of torpedoes. The torpedo hits knocked out Karlsruhes power and thus prevented her crew from <b>pumping</b> <b>out</b> the water that was rapidly flooding the ship. Her crew was taken off by an escorting torpedo boat, which then fired a pair of torpedoes into the stricken cruiser to ensure she sank quickly.|$|E
5000|$|Once in the {{discharge}} port, the cargo is pumped ashore using the cargo pumps. As the tank empties, the vapour space is filled by either gas from ashore or by vaporising some cargo {{in the cargo}} vaporiser.

500|$|In early 1917, Tompkins {{submitted}} {{a plan to}} attempt a <b>pumping</b> <b>out</b> of the constructed cofferdam, which it noted as dangerous to the crew. This plan was denied {{because there was no}} artificial seal in place. The commission did not want Tompkins to proceed until the commission consulted an advisory engineer. In April 1917, William Burr was made the advisory engineer and made many changes to the original Strauss designs, most importantly the requirement that piers project into the concrete cylinders was stricken. Burr's alterations called for an open caisson for the central piers which made impossible the projection of piles into the concrete and required dredging that was unnecessary under the initial Strauss plan. The seal for the end piers was thickened to [...] and would be deposited through a tremie, as previously suggested by Tompkins. The Bridgeport bridge commission terminated the contract on August 20, 1917 and notified Tompkins that it would complete the project. The commission had Tompkin's crew forcibly ejected from the site on September 3, 1917 and took possession of its equipment until October 19, 1917. While the contract allowed the equipment to be taken, it also stipulated that delays that were the fault of the city would result in an equal extension to the time lost and Tompkins would sue the City of Bridgeport. The City of Bridgeport hired another contractor to complete the bridge.|$|E
