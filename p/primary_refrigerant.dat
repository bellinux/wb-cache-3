50|$|An {{immiscible}} <b>primary</b> <b>refrigerant</b> evaporates to supersaturate {{the water}} and form small smooth crystals. With direct contact chilling, there is no physical boundary between the brine and the refrigerant, increasing {{the rate of heat}} transfer. However, the major disadvantage of this system is that a small amount of refrigerant stays in the brine, trapped in the crystals. This refrigerant is pumped with the slurry out of the generator and into the environment.|$|E
5000|$|In direct {{exchange}} systems, the refrigerant exchanges heat {{directly with}} the soil through the copper tubing. The designation “direct exchange" [...] therefore refers to the heat transfer between {{the earth and the}} ground loop without the use of any intermediary. By contrast, water-based geothermal systems rely on two loops on the ground side: a <b>primary</b> <b>refrigerant</b> loop, contained in the appliance cabinet where it exchanges heat with a secondary ground loop that is buried underground and is made of high-density polyethylene containing a mixture of water and anti-freeze (propylene glycol, denatured alcohol or methanol).|$|E
50|$|HFC, HCFC, CFC {{classes of}} {{chemicals}} are all potent greenhouse gases. HCFC and CFC classes of chemicals are {{damaging to the}} ozone layer, with CFCs being a <b>primary</b> culprit. Natural <b>refrigerants,</b> though they may exist in nature, are not in themselves harmless or nontoxic.|$|R
40|$|Chlorofluorocarbons are the <b>primary</b> <b>refrigerants</b> used in vapor-compression air {{conditioning}} and refrigeration systems. Environmental concerns, such as the ozone depletion effect of chlorofluorocarbons, have led to an international agreement on the reduction and eventual elimination of these refrigerants. Alternative, ozone-safe refrigerants have been developed and their evaporation characteristics need to be assessed. A single-tube evaporation test facility has been designed and built to measure these characteristics. An instrumented, eight-foot long (2. 44 m), 0. 402 -inch (10. 21 mm) inside diameter evaporation test section equipped with SCRcontrolled, surface wrapped heaters is the main feature of the design. Leak testing and a preliminary system shakedown have been successfully completed. Baseline testing using CFC- 12 as the reference fluid has been conducted. Mass fluxes were tested over the range of 100, 000 Ibmlhreft 2 (135 kg/sem 2) to 400, 000 Ibmlhreft 2 (540 kg/s??m 2), and heat fluxes were varied from 1600 Btulhreft 2 (5. 1 kW/m 2) to 6400 Btulhr??ft 2 (20. 4 kW/m 2). Evaporation temperatures were between 40 OF (4. 4 OC) and 52 OF (11. 1 OC) with inlet qualities of 20 to 60 percent. Expected trends in the data were observed. Average heat transfer coefficients compared closely with average heat transfer coefficients calculated from correlations of Chaddock-Noerager, Kandlikar, Shah, and Pierre. However, uncertainty in both temperature and heat input measurements require further improvements to the system. Additional capacity of the chiller system is also needed so that lower evaporation temperatures and larger heat additions to the test refrigerant can be maintained.

40|$|As well known, A chiller is a {{refrigeration}} system that cools a process fluid typically water, which is further used in {{commercial and industrial}} ways for process cooling or air-conditioning. With the help of such systems water can be cooled to temperatures as low as 5 °C (~ 40 °F) and pumped through a hydraulic circuit to reach the process equipment or the air handling units. Rather than water some other suitable <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>refrigerants</b> are {{also be used for}} such refrigeration purposes. For still lower temperatures glycol or brine solution may be used (also known as secondary refrigerants). A chiller would use either a vapour compression or absorption cycle to cool. Once cooled or chilled water is used in air-conditioning applications for cooling/dehumidification and thus creating comfortable and productive environments. A large amount of power is required to operate these system. This paper represents the possible and suitable ways of improving the performance of such systems because of maximization in performance is the key requirement of current running refrigeration chillers for energy saving point of view...|$|R
50|$|In an {{open loop}} system (also called a {{groundwater}} heat pump), the secondary loop pumps natural water from a well or body of water into a heat exchanger inside the heat pump. ASHRAE calls {{open loop system}}s groundwater heat pumps or surface water heat pumps, depending on the source. Heat is either extracted or added by the <b>primary</b> <b>refrigerant</b> loop, and the water is returned to a separate injection well, irrigation trench, tile field or body of water. The supply and return lines must be placed far enough apart to ensure thermal recharge of the source. Since the water chemistry is not controlled, the appliance {{may need to be}} protected from corrosion by using different metals in the heat exchanger and pump. Limescale may foul the system over time and require periodic acid cleaning. This is much more of a problem with cooling systems than heating systems. Also, as fouling decreases the flow of natural water, it becomes difficult for the heat pump to exchange building heat with the groundwater. If the water contains high levels of salt, minerals, iron bacteria or hydrogen sulfide, a closed loop system is usually preferable.|$|E
50|$|Most {{installed}} {{systems have}} two loops {{on the ground}} side: the <b>primary</b> <b>refrigerant</b> loop is contained in the appliance cabinet where it exchanges heat with a secondary water loop that is buried underground. The secondary loop is typically made of high-density polyethylene pipe and contains a mixture of water and anti-freeze (propylene glycol, denatured alcohol or methanol). Monopropylene glycol has the least damaging potential when it might leak into the ground, and is therefore the only allowed anti-freeze in ground sources in {{an increasing number of}} European countries. After leaving the internal heat exchanger, the water flows through the secondary loop outside the building to exchange heat with the ground before returning. The secondary loop is placed below the frost line where the temperature is more stable, or preferably submerged in a body of water if available. Systems in wet ground or in water are generally more efficient than drier ground loops since water conducts and stores heat better than solids in sand or soil. If the ground is naturally dry, soaker hoses may be buried with the ground loop to keep it wet.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This study {{presents}} an experimental study on a freezer which has small cooling capacity. Typically a freezer uses <b>primary</b> <b>refrigerant</b> (direct cooling) to cool or freeze a product. In this study, {{a prototype of}} freezer using a compressor 250 W nominal power at 220 V was designed and constructed. The freezer is operated on two conditions, that is, using primary and secondary refrigerant. R 22 and R 290 (propane) were used as <b>primary</b> <b>refrigerant,</b> whereas aqueous solution of propylene glycol as secondary refrigerant. Comparison of the system performance between the primary and the secondary refrigerant werepresented. Also, the experimental {{results showed that the}} use of R 290 as <b>primary</b> <b>refrigerant</b> to replace R 22 in the freezer could save electrical power consumption by 18. 5 %. Meanwhile, the use of the secondary refrigerant yielded energy savings by 33. 19 % compared with the <b>primary</b> <b>refrigerant...</b>|$|E
40|$|Ice slurry, a biphasic refrigerant, {{has been}} instated {{as one of}} the {{potential}} candidates due to its high heat transfer capability as a phase change material. Previous research show that ice slurry flows contribute to reductions in the amount of charge of <b>primary</b> <b>refrigerant</b> and enables load shifting which results in substantial operating cost savings. In this study, a numerical analysis of a heatexchanger performance operated with ice slurry is presented. The role of variousparameters including ice concentration and mass flow rate on the heat transfer and pumping power is presented and results are compared with those for the carrier fluid at the same conditions. The results show that ice slurry and geometry of the heat exchanger enhance the heat transfer performance. A significant increase in the pressure drop is also observed for the ice slurry flowing through this type of heat exchanger...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} a cooling and heating system for obtaining {{temperatures}} {{in the range of}} - 60 C to + 120 C on a thermal shroud is described. The proposed temperature control uses mechanical refrigeration with Freon- 22 as the <b>primary</b> <b>refrigerant,</b> methanol as the secondary coolant for low temperatures, and electrically heated ethylene glycol for high temperatures. The system is designed to give the following time-temperature characteristics: lowering the temperature from + 30 C to - 60 C in 1. 5 hours; maintaining the temperature at - 60 C for a period of 6 hours; heating from - 60 C to + 120 C in 3 hours; maintaining the temperature at + 120 C for a period of 6 hours; and cooling from + 120 C in 1. 5 hours.

40|$|Current {{state of}} research: Direct-expansion systems using HFC <b>primary</b> <b>refrigerant</b> R 404 A. Project objective: Ammonia {{refrigeration}} systems, reduction of total equivalent warming impact (TEWI). Method: Development of ammonia-refrigerated liquid chillers and secondary refrigerant circuits for normal- and low-temperature refrigeration, construction {{and testing of}} a supermarket system and comparison with R 404 A direct-expansion systems. Results: Production of reliably operating ammonia refrigeration systems for medium and large supermarkets is possible. Differences compared to R 404 A direct-expansion systems: - Reduction of TEWI by about 50 %. - Slightly higher energy consumption (approx. 10 - 15 %), can be reduced by further development work. - Higher first cost by approx. 15 - 30 % (varying with size of supermarket and equipment installed). Conclusions: Ammonia refrigeration systems are usable for medium and large supermarkets. Compared to R 404 A direct-expansion systems environmental frindliness is better, but economy is somewhat lower. (orig.)

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an approach {{for control of}} an economiser cycle based {{on the use of}} economiser pressure as theprimary control parameter. In the study, the economiser cycle was used to optimise a multi-temperature indirect (IDX) transport refrigeration system, where hydronic secondary loops were utilised. In transport refrigeration applications, IDX systemscan offer the potential to address a number of important environmental and control issues associated with direct expansion (DX) systems. IDX systems may also give rise to reduced capacity and COP through increased compressor pressure ratios associated with the hydronic secondary circuit and power requirements of the liquid secondary pumps. One approach by which this issue can be addressed is through use of aneconomiser cycle, which provides a mechanism for performance enhancement by augmenting the refrigeration effect of the <b>primary</b> <b>refrigerant,</b> in the primary to secondary heat exchanger of these systems. Previous work ascertained that by control of the mass-flow injection ratio, an economiser cycle can be used to optimise indirect multi-temperature systems for a wide range ofdiverse operating conditions. This method of control necessitates mass-flow instrumentation which is impracticable for field applications. An alternative method of control described here, is based on a more easily measured economiser pressure, thereby eliminating the requirement of mass-flow instrumentation...|$|E
40|$|Direct {{expansion}} (DX) refrigeration {{technology is}} almost exclusively used in multi-temperature transport refrigeration systems. Multi-temperature systems use {{up to three}} evaporators, requiring large refrigerant charges and system pressure control to operate {{over a wide range}} of set-point conditions. Despite incremental design improvements over the past decade, environmental and control issues continue to arise with DX systems. Deployment of indirect refrigeration systems (IDX) offers an alternative approach to address these issues. Indirect systems can however suffer from performance penalties, where reduced cooling capacity and COP occur under certain operating conditions. One strategy, aimed at offsetting the disadvantage of reduced refrigeration capacity, is to incorporate an economiser circuit into the primary cycle of the IDX system. Economiser cycles can enhance the refrigeration effect of the <b>primary</b> <b>refrigerant</b> in the primary to secondary heat exchanger of the indirect system. In this paper, for a multi-temperature transport refrigeration system, the performance of an optimised economised indirect system is compared with a non-economised indirect system and a contemporary direct expansion system. All tests for the economised IDX system were carried out using optimised refrigerant mass flowrate injection ratios, which were established for different operating boundary conditions. Tests were carried out to ATP standard for a Class C multi-compartment vehicle for a range of set point temperatures from - 20 ºC to + 10 ºC...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work, the {{performance}} of a segmentally baffled shell-and-tube evaporator working with liquid overfeeding is investigated. The refrigerant is R 134 a that flows inside the tubes, while water flows on the shell side. A single shell pass has been adopted for the water with one tube pass for the evaporating fluid. The test rig used for the experimental measurements consists of a <b>primary</b> <b>refrigerant</b> loop plus the condenser and the evaporator water auxiliary loops. The evaporator can be fed with two-phase mixture from the expansion valve or with saturated liquid coming from the liquid-vapor separator (in this case a variable speed recirculation pump is used). Inlet and outlet temperatures have been measured for both fluids together with the flow rate allowing the determination of the overall heat transfer coefficient. In addition, pressure drop have been measured on the refrigerant side. Tests have been performed both without overfeeding and with overfeeding at different values of recirculation ratio. The recirculation ratio is defined as the ratio between refrigerant flow rate at the evaporator and the vaporized refrigerant flow rate. Furthermore, measurements have been taken at fixed water outlet temperature and varying the heat duty. In order to study the evaporator behavior, a computational procedure has been developed. Finally, the numerical model of the heat exchanger has been validated against experimental data...|$|E
40|$|The {{off-cycle}} {{refrigerant mass}} migration {{has a direct}} influence on the on-cycle performance since compressor energy is necessary to redistribute the refrigerant mass. No studies, as of today, {{are available in the}} open literature which experimentally measured the lubricant migration within a refrigeration system during cycling or stop/start transients. Therefore, experimental procedures measuring the refrigerant and lubricant migration through the major components of a refrigeration system during stop/start transients were developed and implemented. Results identifying the underlying physics are presented. The refrigerant and lubricant migration of an R 134 a automotive A/C system-utilizing a fixed orifice tube, minichannel condenser, plate and fin evaporator, U-tube type accumulator and fixed displacement compressor-was measured across five sections divided by ball valves. Using the Quick-Closing Valve Technique (QCVT) combined with the Remove and Weigh Technique (RWT) using liquid nitrogen as the condensing agent resulted in a measurement uncertainty of 0. 4 percent regarding the total refrigerant mass in the system. The determination of the lubricant mass distribution was achieved by employing three different techniques-Remove and Weigh, Mix and Sample, and Flushing. To employ the Mix and Sample Technique a device-called the Mix and Sample Device-was built. A method to separate the refrigerant and lubricant was developed with an accuracy-after separation-of 0. 04 grams of refrigerant left in the lubricant. When applying the three techniques, the total amount of lubricant mass in the system was determined to within two percent. The combination of measurement results-infrared photography and high speed and real time videography-provide unprecedented insight into the mechanisms of refrigerant and lubricant migration during stop-start operation. During the compressor stop period, the <b>primary</b> <b>refrigerant</b> mass migration is caused by, and follows, the diminishing pressure difference across the expansion device. The secondary refrigerant migration is caused by a pressure gradient as a result of thermal nonequilibrium within the system and causes only vapor phase refrigerant migration. Lubricant migration is proportional to the refrigerant mass during the <b>primary</b> <b>refrigerant</b> mass migration. During the secondary refrigerant mass migration lubricant is not migrating. The start-up refrigerant mass migration is caused by an imbalance of the refrigerant mass flow rates across the compressor and expansion device. The higher compressor refrigerant mass flow rate was a result of the entrainment of foam into the U-tube of the accumulator. The lubricant mass migration during the start-up was not proportional to the refrigerant mass migration. The presence of water condensate on the evaporator affected the refrigerant mass migration during the compressor stop period. Caused by an evaporative cooling effect the evaporator held 56 percent of the total refrigerant mass in the system after three minutes of compressor stop time-compared to 25 percent when no water condensate was present on the evaporator coil. Foam entrainment led to a faster lubricant and refrigerant mass migration out of the accumulator than liquid entrainment through the hole {{at the bottom of the}} U-tube. The latter was observed for when water condensate was present on the evaporator coil because-as a result of the higher amount of refrigerant mass in the evaporator before start-up-the entrainment of foam into the U-tube of the accumulator ceased before the steady state refrigerant mass distribution was reached...|$|E
40|$|Refrigerant leakage {{associated}} with multi-temperature direct expansion (DX) systems in transport refrigeration applications has {{lead to increased}} interest in alternative refrigeration concepts. One alternative design approach aimed at reducing refrigerant charge and simplifying system control, {{involves the use of}} an indirect (IDX) refrigeration circuit. Recent investigations, concerned with the deployment of indirect systems for supermarket applications have shown that penalties in cooling capacity and COP can exist under certain operating conditions. These performance deficiencies are attributed to a number of factors including: additional power requirements of secondary circulation pumps, temperature glide {{associated with}} the secondary working fluid, and increased compressor pressure lift due to the additional primary to secondary heat exchanger. One design strategy, aimed at offsetting the disadvantage of reduced refrigeration capacity is to incorporate an economiser circuit into the primary cycle of the IDX system. Economiser cycles can enhance the refrigeration effect of the <b>primary</b> <b>refrigerant</b> in the primary to secondary heat exchanger of the indirect system. The net effect can result in increased refrigeration capacity, if appropriate mass flowrates of refrigerant are expanded through the economiser circuit. However, to date, there is little evidence of the use of an economiser cycle in more complex refrigeration systems, such as multi temperature transport systems, which are subject to significant variation in boundary conditions and operate frequently under transient conditions. This paper examines for a multi-temperature indirect transport refrigeration system, the influence of injection ratio on system performance under ATP conditions as well as the sensitivity of system parameters to different injection ratios. It is found that system capacity and COP can be modulated by regulation of injection ratio. An optimum injection ratio exists which allows maximisation of system capacity and COP respectively. This optimum injection ratio appears to be dependent on set-point and ambient conditions...|$|E
40|$|Interest in {{indirect}} (secondary) refrigeration {{systems has}} grown since {{the discovery of}} the negative effect of environmentally hazardous refrigerants and leakage problems from direct expansion systems. Among the positive effects of indirect systems are: decreased quantities of <b>primary</b> <b>refrigerant,</b> factory built units and confinement of refrigerant to the machine room. Ground source heat pumps, ice rink and indirect system solutions for supermarket refrigeration are examples where indirect refrigeration systems are being used in Sweden. The secondary fluids circulating in the secondary systems are of great interest as its choice can affect heat transfer process; the overall performance of system; corrosion problems and maintenance costs as well as acceptable risks for the environment in case of leakage from the secondary system. A secondary fluid should have low viscosity, high thermal conductivity, high volumetric heat capacity, low freezing point, be non-corrosive, non-explosive, non-flammable, environmentally friendly, non-toxic, give low pressure drop in the system, have good material compatibility, chemically stable and have low cost. The market for secondary fluids worldwide and in Sweden is complex and a comprehensive overview of the available secondary fluids has not been available. The purpose of this thesis is to compile most of the existing secondary fluids on the Swedish market and present them briefly in this report. Different brands of secondary fluids on the Swedish market based on ethylene and propylene glycol, ethyl alcohol, potassium formate, potassium acetate, calcium chloride and other blends are presented in the thesis. Some of the most common brands are: Eco MPG, Dowcal 200, Dowcal N, Zitrec FC, Zitrec LC, Antifrogen L, Frigogel Neo, Heliogel CS 80, Brineol MPG, Glytherm 20, Zitre MC, Dowcal 100, Antifrogen N, Neutragel Neo, Brineol MEG, Glytherm 10, Antifrogen Sol HT, Freezium, Hycool, Antifrogen KF, Brine 25, Swedbrine 25, Brenntag KBS, Brineol Bioethanol, E-Therm KBS Bio, Thermol, Zitrec S, Temper, Pekasol 50, Pekasol 2000, Greenway RTU, Greenway Heat Pump - 30, greenway Solar - 30, Thermera R and Thermera AC. Additionally, it is important to underline that a permit for installation of ground source heat pumps in Sweden is required. Swedish laws and regulations regarding secondary fluids and ground source heat pumps are complex and difficult to overview on municipalities’ levels. ...|$|E
40|$|The work {{consists}} of a design of an industrial freezer for Bastuträsk Charkuteri and the freezer should be built together with the existing plant in a good way. Dimensions have partially been measured by hand and some measures have also been read from old drawings of the factory. Based on these, drawings of the new building have been drawn partially by hand and partially by using Google SketchUp software and LayOut. Based on the literature associated with the project a suggestion {{for the construction of}} the foundation and the design of the freezer was developed in liaison with the supervisor. The freezer is built alongside the existing building, with a loading dock broadened out. The calculations for the load-bearing structure and the required power for the freezer have been done in Excel. Bearing structure is to be built in steel and the foundation shall be composed (from the ground up) of the base plate, double layer plastic foil vapour barrier, insulation and 10 - 15 cm concrete wearing slab. All the concrete layers need to be reinforced. The walls shall be built with freezer panels and the proposition is to use Sandwich panels from Ki-panel that have a width of 180 mm. They should have the coating on the inside in food grade polyester, 25 micrometres, and a coating of PVF 2 / PVDF for outdoor use on the outside. Suggested refrigerant for use is R 448 A in a four cylinder piston compressor 4 GE- 23 Y- 40 P from Bitzer in an indirect cooling system with subcritical carbon dioxide as a secondary refrigerant. The heat exchanger that is recommended to be used between the secondary and the <b>primary</b> <b>refrigerant</b> is TK 20 from Alfa Laval and the BR LCE 136 evaporator from Buffalo Trident is propositioned for the carbon dioxide inside the freezer.
