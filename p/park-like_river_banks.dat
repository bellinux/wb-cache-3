40|$|In recent years, {{average monthly}} {{precipitation}} is decreasing while daily rainfall intensity increases. Additionally, {{the frequency of}} heavy downpour in the last 20 years is the highest {{over the past century}} of which two months from August to September are paid attention. The possible effect of this trend on global warming is high. Damage of <b>river</b> <b>bank</b> by torrential rainfall occurs in many parts of Japan, and <b>river</b> <b>bank</b> of the Tenryu River was burst after a record heavy rain in Nagano prefecture in July 2006. Specifically, influence of <b>river</b> <b>bank</b> by torrential rainfall and seepage from river water are apprehended. Moreove r, behavior of partial saturation on <b>river</b> <b>bank</b> is not grasped circumstantially, so vulnerability evaluation of <b>river</b> <b>bank</b> is ne cessary in torrential rainfall. However, there is a multitude of infrastructure such as <b>river</b> <b>bank</b> all over Japan, and it is inefficient to check the vulnerability on all <b>river</b> <b>banks</b> b y laboratory tests. Moreover, soil properties vary in each area of Japan, and local soil material of the area where the <b>river</b> <b>bank</b> is to be sited is used for construction. Consequently, this study performed water retentivity test of soil simulating seepage process in <b>river</b> <b>bank</b> by using representative soil materials from <b>river</b> <b>banks</b> from each area of Japan. From the result, the authors compared soil -water retentivity curve and one dimensional deformati on characteristics of soil material in seepage process and evaluated vulnerability of <b>river</b> <b>bank</b> in each area...|$|R

40|$|A {{network of}} logical sensors to create river charts during an {{exploration}} cruise is presented. The image sensors included are: a radar, two stereo video cameras, and a laser scanner operating in vertical mode. Features extracted are {{measurements of the}} <b>river</b> <b>bank,</b> the gradient of the <b>river</b> <b>bank</b> and stationary or moving objects on the water {{as well as on}} the <b>river</b> <b>bank.</b> The <b>river</b> <b>bank</b> measurements are combined with the knowledge of the corresponding gradient and afterwards translated into separate occupancy grids. After fusing all grids into one, a feature based representation is extracted from the latter. Results obtained are presented...|$|R

50|$|An {{important}} part of Rosario's urban character is its <b>river</b> <b>bank.</b> The city recovered the <b>river</b> <b>bank</b> of the Paraná not long ago, thanks to a reorganization of terrains formerly owned by the port and the national railroad system.

50|$|Ardfinnan Anglers have {{cover of}} {{approximately}} 15 km of <b>river</b> <b>bank</b> on the <b>river</b> Suir. Brown trout and Salmon can {{be caught in}} these waters. The <b>river</b> <b>banks</b> are maintained annually by club members who perform the work voluntarily before the season kicks off. Most parts of the <b>river</b> <b>banks</b> have {{plenty of room for}} Fly Fishing. The stretch of river has some shallow runs but the majority of the river is deep and would not be suitable for wading.|$|R
40|$|Aerial {{photographs}} {{are used by}} river scientists and engineers in studies related to river channel morphology, channel migration, habitat classification and flood inundation mapping. All these studies involve manual digitization of <b>river</b> <b>banks</b> using aerial photographs. Although human judgment is required in the overall process, manual digitization of <b>river</b> <b>banks</b> is a tedious task often prone to human errors. Using ArcObjects, a GIS tool is developed that uses aerial photographs in conjunction with stream lines from the National Hydrography Dataset to delineate <b>river</b> channel <b>banks.</b> The tool uses multivariate analysis to classify aerial photographs based on pixel statistics. The tool {{is applied to the}} lower Brazos River in Texas to delineate <b>river</b> <b>banks</b> for instream flow studies. Although developed primarily for delineating <b>river</b> <b>banks,</b> the tool can be easily modified to delineate other waterbodies in a watershed...|$|R
