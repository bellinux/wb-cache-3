5|$|The video drew many {{comparisons}} to the rumors of Carey's deteriorating marriage at the time. Author Chris Nickson felt the video, like the song, {{served as a}} metaphor for the things that were taking <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> life at the time. Rumors circulated that Mottola was controlling, abusive and would even monitor Carey's phone calls. For this reason, she is portrayed with tattered clothing and hair in the video, with the final moments showing her escape. It features Carey finally leaving the lonely and abusive marriage she once was part of, and finally breaking free into the outside world. Unlike the video, the lyrics spoke of setting your loved one free, because it is the best thing for them; showing that their love for the person should be greater than their own happiness.|$|E

There are public Otto Hahn Centers in Göttingen and Ottobrunn (near Munich), and planned {{in the near future}} also in Hahn's native city Frankfurt/Main, while in 2011 the city of Albstadt created an Otto Hahn Memorial <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> local IHK-Academy, focussed on Hahn's work in Tailfingen at the end of World War II. In early 2014, the University of Dortmund opened two new Otto Hahn Libraries in her General University Library, which are specialized in the natural sciences and technologies.|$|E

25|$|Initial {{production}} of the Prouty novel had {{to take into account}} that European locales would not be possible in the midst of World War II, despite the novelist's insistence on using Italy as the main setting. Prouty's quirky demands for vibrant colors and flashbacks shot in black and white with subtitles were similarly disregarded. Principal photography was shifted to Warner's sound stage 18 and various locations around California, including the San Bernardino National Forest, while European scenes were replaced by stock footage of Brazil. One of the primary reasons for Davis being interested in the original project was that photography would also take <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> hometown of Boston.|$|E
25|$|In Vilnius, Bortkevičienė joined {{an illegal}} intellectuals' society, later {{known as the}} Twelve Apostles of Vilnius. Through book {{smuggler}} Motiejus Baltūsis, Bortkevičienė gained access to the illegal Lithuanian newspapers Varpas, Ūkininkas, Naujienos. After Baltūsis's arrest in 1902, she became involved in book smuggling and in publication of these newspapers. She would send manuscripts to the editors and raise money for their expenses. Some of the illegal publications would be hidden in the Church of St. Nicholas. She {{became a member of}} central committee the Lithuanian Democratic Party (LDP), established in October 1902, {{and a member of the}} board of the Lithuanian Women's Association, established in September 1905. Her home became the gathering place for the intellectuals; sessions of LDP took <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> home.|$|E

One year later, she was able to announce the formation of a group composed of the French National Front, the Freedom Party of Austria, the Italian Lega Nord, the Dutch Party for Freedom, the Polish Congress of the New Right, the Flemish Vlaams Belang and former UKIP member Janice Atkinson. Her first attempt to constitute this group in 2014 failed because of the UKIP refusal and some controversial statements of her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, in June. Le Pen sat in the commission for international trade. In 2016, Politico ranked her as the second-most influential MEP after Martin Schulz.|$|E

25|$|In August, it was {{revealed}} that Kvitová was diagnosed with mononucleosis and that she contracted the virus during spring earlier in the year but nevertheless, was cleared to compete. During the US Open series, Kvitová lost her openers in Toronto and Cincinnati. Then, as the defending champion at the Connecticut Open, second-seeded Kvitová received a bye in the opening round and safely advanced to the semifinals after defeating Keys and Agnieszka Radwańska. She then rolled past Caroline Wozniacki in straight sets for a <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> fourth straight final at the tournament, where she beat compatriot Lucie Šafářová in three sets for her 17th career title. With this win, she successfully defended a title for the first time. At the US Open, Kvitová was the fifth seed and reached the round of 16 after defeating Laura Siegemund, wildcard Nicole Gibbs and 32nd seed Anna Karolína Schmiedlová, all in straight sets. She then advanced to her maiden quarterfinal of the tournament after seeing off qualifier Johanna Konta, thus completing the feat of reaching at least the quarterfinals of all four Grand Slams. There, she fell short to 26th seed and eventual champion Flavia Pennetta in three sets.|$|E

500|$|As she {{had started}} to do in her first autobiography, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, and {{continued}} throughout her series, Angelou upholds the long tradition of African-American autobiography. At {{the same time she}} makes a deliberate attempt to challenge the usual structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing, and expanding the genre. Angelou had matured as a writer by the time she wrote Traveling Shoes, to the point {{that she was able to}} play with the form and structure of the work. [...] As in her previous books, it consists of a series of anecdotes connected by theme. [...] She depicts her struggle with being the mother of a grown son, and with her <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> new home.|$|E
500|$|The Enterprise {{reaches the}} Neutral Zone and {{confirms}} that the outposts have been destroyed. They are soon met by a Romulan Warbird and Commander Tebok (Marc Alaimo) questions why the Enterprise has approached the zone. As Picard tries to explain his actions, Offenhouse arrives on the bridge and threatens to disrupt the tense situation, though he correctly ascertains that the Romulans are also seeking answers. Picard and the Romulans agree to pool their resources to discover the culprit. Picard later comments that while the encounter went favorably, the Romulans may be a significant threat in future engagements. Picard arranges to transport the 20th-Century humans to Earth. [...] Troi locates one of Claire's descendants on Earth, and while Claire is unsure of her <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> new reality, Troi suggests that family is a good starting point. Clemmons expresses enthusiasm for the future, and Picard sets Offenhouse the challenge of improving himself.|$|E
500|$|As {{children}} {{coming of}} age, Scout and Jem face hard realities {{and learn from}} them. Lee seems to examine Jem's sense of loss about how his neighbors have disappointed him more than Scout's. Jem says to their neighbor Miss Maudie {{the day after the}} trial, [...] "It's like bein' a caterpillar wrapped in a cocoon... I always thought Maycomb folks were the best folks in the world, least that's what they seemed like". This leads him to struggle with understanding the separations of race and class. Just as the novel is an illustration of the changes Jem faces, it is also an exploration of the realities Scout must face as an atypical girl on the verge of womanhood. As one scholar writes, [...] "To Kill a Mockingbird can be read as a feminist Bildungsroman, for Scout emerges from her childhood experiences with a clear sense of her <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> community and an awareness of her potential power as the woman she will one day be." ...|$|E

500|$|This episode {{sees the}} return of River Song, {{the woman from the}} Doctor's future who was {{previously}} seen in [...] "Silence in the Library" [...] and [...] "Forest of the Dead". [...] "The Time of Angels" [...] takes <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> relative past, where she is a doctor, having not yet become a professor. She shows the ability to fly the TARDIS, which she says she learned from [...] "the best" [...] and then teases the Doctor it was not him. (In [...] "Let's Kill Hitler", it will be shown that the TARDIS taught her to fly it.) In addition, the words she inscribed on the home box in Old High Gallifreyan ("Hello, Sweetie!") are the same words by which she greets the Tenth Doctor in [...] "Silence in the Library". The crash of the Byzantium was first mentioned in [...] "Silence in the Library", when River asks the Tenth Doctor, after consulting her diary, if they've done that yet.|$|E
500|$|A single mother, Donna raised Angela {{and her two}} half-sisters {{with the}} help of {{government}} assistance. [...] They lived in a subsidized townhouse in the Flemingdon Park neighbourhood of Toronto. Donna worked as a bookkeeper and at the concession stand of the local arena. She battled depression and mental illness and her eldest daughter, Cindy, worked two part-time jobs at the age of 16 to help the family meet financial obligations. Angela was closest to her sister Kym, though the two [...] often fought as children. Her father never had a consistent <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> life growing up and did not provide financial support to the family, but was available if she needed him. [...] As one of few black children in Flemingdon Park, Angela often faced insults, particularly over {{the fact that she was}} a mixed-race child with a white mother and sisters. She often got into fights over the slurs, forming a combative attitude she carried into the game of hockey. Her maternal grandparents never accepted Angela as a child, though they treated her sisters well.|$|E

After much {{encouragement}} from him, Cynthia agreed to try LSD one more time, but the adverse effects were the same. Although she said at the time she would never take the drug again, she relented and took it for the last time a few weeks later, {{on the way to a}} party at Epstein's country house in Warbleton, East Sussex. Although she hated the psychological effects of the drug, from this point she could see the change taking <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> husband: [...] "It was like living with someone who had just discovered religion ... Tensions, bigotry, and bad temper were replaced by understanding and love". In 1970, Lennon confessed he had probably taken LSD one thousand times since 1965, saying: [...] "I used to just eat it all the time". [...] In the decades ahead, Cynthia would always maintain that John's drug use was the beginning of the end for the couple.|$|E

At Survivor Series on November 21, she lost the Divas Championship when Natalya defeated McCool and Layla in a two-on-one handicap match. At , McCool and Layla were defeated in the first-ever Divas tag team tables match by Natalya and Beth Phoenix. LayCool invoked their rematch clause in January 2011, prompting the scheduling of a two-on-one handicap match at the Royal Rumble.

500|$|Anne's father {{continued}} his diplomatic career under Henry VIII. In Europe, Thomas Boleyn's charm won many admirers, including Margaret of Austria, daughter of Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor. During this period, Margaret ruled the Netherlands on her nephew Charles's behalf {{and was so}} impressed with Boleyn that she offered his daughter Anne a <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> household. Ordinarily, a girl had to be twelve years old to have such an honour, but Anne may have been younger, as the Archduchess affectionately referred to her as [...] "la petite Boulin [...] ". Anne made a good impression in the Netherlands with her manners and studiousness, Margaret reported that she was well spoken and pleasant for her young age. and told Sir Thomas Boleyn that his daughter was [...] "so presentable and so pleasant, considering her youthful age, that I am more beholden to you for sending her to me, than you to me" [...] (E.W. Ives, op.cit.). Anne stayed with Margaret from spring 1513 until her father arranged for her to attend Henry VIII's sister Mary, who was about to marry Louis XII of France in October 1514.|$|E
500|$|The travel motif is a {{recurring}} theme in Traveling Shoes, as evidenced in the book's title, but Angelou's primary motivation in living in Africa, as she told interviewer George Plimpton, was [...] "trying to get home". Angelou not only related her own journey of an African-American woman searching for a home, but the journeys of other Black expatriates at the time, whom McPherson compared to the descriptions of white expatriates in Europe in the 1920s by Ernest Hemingway and Henry James. Angelou's issues were resolved {{at the end of}} Traveling Shoes when she decided to return to America. She called her departure a [...] "second leave-taking", and compared it to the last time she left her son with his grandmother in Singin' and Swingin' when he was a child, and to the forced departure from Africa by her ancestors. As Lupton states, [...] "Angelou's journey from Africa back to America is in certain ways a restatement of the historical phase known as mid-passage, when slaves were brutally transported in ships from West Africa to the so-called New World". Even though Angelou's final autobiography A Song Flung Up to Heaven took <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> home country, the travel motif continued. [...] Reviewer Patricia Elam described Song as a [...] "journey through an authentic and artistic life".|$|E
