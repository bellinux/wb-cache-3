40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 144 - 151) Examination of 1970 {{air transport}} schedules for Los Angeles reveals a complex pattern of service equaled or surpassed by only two other American cities, Chicago and New York. This thesis attempts to explain these patterns through {{analysis and interpretation}} of the forces and processes which created them. Development of the Los Angeles air transport system is traced from the 1920 inauguration of coast-to-coast air mail service through 1970, emphasizing the roles of economics, government, innovation, social behavior and technology as processes forming contemporary air transport service patterns. The early history of air transport involved Los Angeles to an insignificant degree, as most developments occurred in the east; however, with the first transatlantic flight accomplished in a Southern California-built aircraft, {{and the emergence of}} scheduled airline service, the early disadvantage vanished. Through the 1930 's and World War II, the significance of Los Angeles as a principal air transport center increased, with technological change and governmental regulation as the primary forces present. The post-war period was characterized by the introduction of specialized services, namely, local service, intrastate, commuter and all cargo carriers. Since 1950, increasing leisure time, rising personal income, <b>promotional</b> <b>fares,</b> route awards, and technological change (especially jet introduction) have contributed to the changing pattern; innovations in mail, express and freight transport have contributed also. Finally, two forces have been evident throughout in the growth of air transport: diversion from other modes and stimulation resulting from introduction of air carrier service to an expanding number of cities...|$|R
25|$|Advertised fares {{to all of}} {{the former}} target cities began at US$10 one-way; the price {{increased}} as more tickets were sold for that flight. Advertisements suggest that ten seats on each flight were sold at the <b>promotional</b> $10 <b>fare.</b> Other fares promoted by Skybus included a $20.08 fare sale (plus fees and taxes) to some of the airline's less popular destinations, to celebrate the New Year. Ticket prices for the remaining fares were expected to be around half the price of other airlines. These fares did not include taxes and other airport fees, however, which add about $10 to a one-way ticket. All fees included, the cheapest round-trip ticket for one adult would have cost approximately $40.|$|R
40|$|The {{purposes}} of this research were to examine the characteristics of those who look for physical activity-related information, where they find it, and to examine what types of physical activity-related advertisements are recalled (i. e., publicly funded or commercial). These purposes were tested using secondary data analyses from two population health surveys. Results from the first survey (n = 1211) showed gender, age, education, and activity-level differences in who {{is more likely to}} search for physical activity-related information. Adding the goal of being active into the model made age and activity level no longer significant but gender and education remained significant factors. The Internet was the most often cited source of physical activity information. The second survey (n = 1600) showed that adults 55 years of age or older and participants with the least amount of education were {{more than twice as likely}} to name commercial advertisements than were participants aged 18 – 54 years or those with more education. These results help further our understanding of how publicly funded <b>promotional</b> campaigns <b>fare</b> against commercial advertising and also highlight the need to understand physical activity information-seeking behavior on the Internet and its implications for health promotion...|$|R
