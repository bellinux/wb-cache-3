50|$|For {{several years}} in the 1970s, Singer set up a {{national}} sales force for CAT <b>phototypesetting</b> <b>machines</b> (of UNIX troff fame) made by another Massachusetts company, Graphic Systems Inc. This division was purchased by Wang Laboratories in 1978.|$|R
50|$|Trinité was {{originally}} designed for <b>phototypesetting</b> <b>machines.</b> In 1978, the printing office Joh. Enschedé replaced their <b>phototypesetting</b> <b>machines</b> (with Autologic machines), {{for which they}} wanted to adapt Jan van Krimpen's typeface Romanée. The company consulted with De Does, who was against it. He feared that Romanée would lose its character in the translation from metal movable type to phototype, specifically because Romanée {{was not a single}} font but several versions, one for each point size, which would not be possible to preserve in phototype. He considered commissioning a new typeface, specifically designed for the new technology, a much better idea. Although it was not his intention, Enschedé invited him to design this new typeface.|$|R
50|$|In the 1980s the Teletypesetting Co. {{developed}} a {{hardware and software}} interface that allowed Compugraphic <b>phototypesetting</b> <b>machines</b> to connect to personal computers such as the Apple IIIn 1987, a U.S. patent for Intellifont, a system of hinted scaling computer fonts, was granted to Thomas B. Hawkins of Compugraphic.|$|R
40|$|Hermann Zapf was {{involved}} {{in many of the}} demands for digital typefaces which came into existence from 1972 through 1997. These issues included formats, variations, interpolation, rasterizing, hinting, and grayscaling. Within modern text composition, digital text is a special part that should proceed without manual assistance and human layout. Up to now, the mile-stones were these: kerning, optical scaling, paragraph composition (H-program), and chapter composition (chapter fit). Digital typefaces In 1972, creative typesetting professionals produced variations manually using their photographic experi-ence and a <b>phototypesetting</b> <b>machine</b> to make fonts with contours and shadows. Naturally, shadowing as well as contouring were my next features, which I started on 26 February 1973. This date might be re-garded as the birth of “digital typefaces”: new forms were generated automatically (see Figure 1). My programs crashed quite often and generated substandard looking results. But anyhow, I got it fly-ing further and further. That influenced my decision to call the software Ikarus [6] in 1974. The first time I met Hermann Zapf was in the summer of 1975. I had just completed the basic parts of the Ikarus program which could already generate “digital typefaces ” in the form of contoured, slanted and shadowed versions based on hand-digitized out-lines. Zapf was amazed to see what I could present to him (see Figures 1 and 2). He decided to include me with a presentation of Ikarus in his general pre-sentation which he had to give at the next ATypI conference in the fall of 1975 in Warsaw. It began a close relationship between us. This had a very decisive influence on the future develop-ment of our company URW Software & Type GmbH. These days, everyone regards all fonts on com-puters as digital fonts since they are stored in digital formats such as OpenType. In the early seventies, we had long discussions with famous designers. They argued that pure mapping from analogue to digital is not changing the basic quality of a typeface (old properties), namely its type, appearance, effect, ex-pression and congeniality. Therefore they asserted that the typefaces only had digital images and were therefore still analogue. “Digital ” at that time was regarded as a pseudo-property...|$|E
50|$|Carter {{would later}} become the typographic advisor to Crosfield Electronics, {{distributors}} of Photon <b>phototypesetting</b> <b>machines.</b> Carter designed many typefaces for Mergenthaler Linotype as well. Under Linotype, Carter created well-known typefaces including Snell Roundhand, a script typeface and Bell Centennial, intended {{for use in the}} Bell System's phone directories and to celebrate its anniversary.|$|R
25|$|Ligatures {{began to}} fall out of use due to their {{complexity}} in the 20th century. Sans serif typefaces, increasingly used for body text, generally avoid ligatures, though notable exceptions include Gill Sans and Futura. Inexpensive <b>phototypesetting</b> <b>machines</b> in the 1970s (which did not require journeyman knowledge or training to operate) also generally avoid them.|$|R
50|$|CRT-based editing terminals, {{which can}} work compatibly {{with a variety}} of <b>phototypesetting</b> <b>machines,</b> were a major {{technical}} innovation in this regard. Keyboarding the original text on a CRT screen, with easy-to-use editing commands, is faster than keyboarding on a Linotype machine. Storing the text magnetically for easy retrieval and subsequent editing also saves time.|$|R

50|$|Since most early <b>phototypesetting</b> <b>machines</b> {{can only}} create one column of type at a time, long galleys of type were pasted onto layout boards {{in order to}} create a full page of text for {{magazines}} and newsletters. Paste-up artists played an important role in creating production art. Later phototypesetters have multiple column features that allow the typesetter to save paste-up time.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Phototypesetting</b> <b>machines</b> project {{characters}} onto {{film for}} offset printing. In 1949 the Photon Corporation in Cambridge, Mass. developed equipment {{based on the}} Lumitype of Rene Higonnet and Louis Moyroud. The Lumitype-Photon was first used to set a complete published book in 1953, and for newspaper work in 1954. [...] Mergenthaler produced the Linofilm using a different design, and Monotype produced Monophoto. Other companies followed with products that included Alphatype and Varityper.|$|R
50|$|In 1995, Hans Eduard Meier and Linotype {{began to}} produce an {{extensive}} revision and expansion of the Syntax font family. Based on original font design, the alterations made to accommodate hot metal and <b>phototypesetting</b> <b>machines</b> were discarded. The family was expanded to 6 weights with italics on all weights. All fonts include old style figures and proportional lining figures, while 3 lightest weights also include small caps glyphs. Regular and bold weight fonts also include Cyrillic characters. Letters such as @, C, R, ﬁ, ﬂ, were redesigned.|$|R
5000|$|The next {{generation}} of <b>phototypesetting</b> <b>machines</b> to emerge were those that generated characters on a cathode ray tube. Typical of the type were the Alphanumeric APS2 (1963), IBM 2680 (1967), I.I.I. VideoComp (1973?), Autologic APS5 (1975), and Linotron 202 (1978). [...] These machines were the mainstay of phototypesetting {{for much of the}} 1970s and 1980s. Such machines could be [...] "driven online" [...] by a computer front-end system or took their data from magnetic tape. Type fonts were stored digitally on conventional magnetic disk drives.|$|R
50|$|The major {{advancement}} {{presented by}} the <b>phototypesetting</b> <b>machines</b> over the Linotype machine hot-type machines was the elimination of metal type, an intermediate step no longer required once offset printing became the norm. This cold-type technology {{could also be used}} in office environments where hot-metal machines (the Mergenthaler Linotype, the Harris Intertype and the Monotype) could not. The use of phototypesetting grew rapidly in the 1960s when software was developed to convert marked up copy, usually typed on paper tape, to the codes that controlled the phototypesetters.|$|R
50|$|As <b>phototypesetting</b> <b>machines</b> matured as a {{technology}} in the 1970s, more efficient methods were found for creating and subsequently editing text intended for the printed page. Previously, hot-metal typesetting equipment had incorporated a built-in keyboard, such that the machine operator would create both the original text and the medium (lead type slugs) that would create the printed page. Subsequent editing of this copy required that the entire process be repeated. The operator would re-keyboard {{some or all of}} the original text, incorporating the corrections and new material into the original draft.|$|R
50|$|The Deluxe Corporation {{also used}} {{a bank of}} Series/1 IBM 4956 {{computers}} for each check printing facility which handled the plant's business and personal check sales orders and printing operations. Various serial peripherals were attached: Printronix bar-coding printers, MICR Readers, IBM ASCII Terminals. Parallel devices were also used for <b>phototypesetting</b> <b>machines,</b> plate makers and Teletype BRPE punch creating Punched tape; all connecting to the IBM integrated DI/DO Digital In/Out card. The Series/1 was a good work horse for its day and was operational around the clock in an industrial environment.|$|R
50|$|Printers {{attached}} {{directly to}} computers {{allowed them to}} print documents directly, in multiple copies or as an original which could be copied on a ditto machine or photocopier. WYSIWYG word processors {{made it possible for}} general office users and consumers to make more sophisticated page layouts, use text justification, and use more fonts than were possible with typewriters. Early dot matrix printing was sufficient for office documents, but was of too low a quality for professional typesetting. Inkjet printing and laser printing did produce sufficient quality type, and so computers with these types of printers quickly replaced <b>phototypesetting</b> <b>machines.</b>|$|R
50|$|Sensing {{that the}} {{electronics}} industry {{was in its}} infancy and poised to expand, the two founders established the company in 1981, initially operating in the phototypesetting industry. TeleTypesetting {{was one of the}} first companies to produce a hardware and software interface between personal computers such as the Apple II and IBM PS/2 and numerous models of <b>phototypesetting</b> <b>machines</b> such as the Compugraphic Compuwriter and CompEdit, and Varityper EPICS, Comp/Set and Comp/Edit.TeleTypesetting Co. created a package called MicroSetter, composed of a desk accessory, cables, conversion software, and connectivity software, which provided computers equipped with it the capability to connect to <b>phototypesetting</b> <b>machines.</b> MicroSetter was compatible with numerous desktop publishing applications such as Ready,Set,Go, Page Maker, Microsoft Word, MacWrite, and MacDraw.Use of personal computers took advantage of functions such as spell checking and printing on plain paper prior to printing on expensive phototypesetting paper which could not easily be corrected after the photographic process was completed thereby saving time and expense while providing more accurate results.From the MicroSetter product line evolved the T-Script PostScript interpreter (also referred to in the industry as a Raster image processor) which converted output from popular PostScript based WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) programs such as PageMaker, Microsoft Word and MacWrite to non PostScript printers which were much more economical at the time. This provided the user the ability to see the document on the screen as it would appear on the printer.|$|R
50|$|Early {{electronic}} typesetting {{programs were}} designed to drive phototypesetters, most notably the Graphic Systems CAT phototypesetter that troff was designed to provide input for. Though such programs still exist, their output is no longer targeted at any specific form of hardware.Some companies, such as TeleTypesetting Co. created software and hardware interfaces between personal computers like the Apple II and IBM PS/2 and <b>phototypesetting</b> <b>machines</b> which provided computers equipped with it the capability to connect to phototypesetting machines.With the start of desktop publishing software, Trout Computing in California introduced VepSet, which allows Xerox Ventura Publisher {{to be used as}} a front end and wrote a Compugraphic MCS disk with typesetting codes to reproduce the page layout.|$|R
50|$|Bram de Does' first {{typeface}} was the serif typeface Trinité, {{released in}} 1982. In 1978 Enschedé replaced their <b>phototypesetting</b> <b>machines,</b> {{for which they}} wanted to adapt Jan van Krimpen's typeface Romanée. The company consulted with De Does, who was against it, fearing the typeface would lose its character in the translation from metal movable type to phototype. He considered commissioning a new typeface, specifically designed for the new technology, a much better idea. Although {{it was not his}} intention, Enschedé invited him to design this new typeface. Trinité was developed from 1979 to 1982. It is currently available as a PostScript Type 1 font from The Enschedé Font Foundry (TEFF). In 1991 De Does won the H.N. Werkmanprize for the design.|$|R
50|$|An {{enormous}} advance {{was made}} by the mid-1960s with the development of equipment that projects the characters from CRT screens. Alphanumeric Corporation (later Autologic) produced the APS series. Rudolf Hell developed the Digiset machine in Germany. The RCA Graphic Systems Division manufactured this in the U.S. as the Videocomp, later marketed by Information International Inc.. Software for operator-controlled hyphenation was a major component of electronic typesetting. Early work on this topic produced paper tape to control hot-metal machines. C. J. Duncan, at the University of Durham in England, was a pioneer. The earliest applications of computer-controlled <b>phototypesetting</b> <b>machines</b> produced the output of the Russian translation programs of Gilbert King at the IBM Research Laboratories, and built-up mathematical formulas and other material in the Cooperative Computing Laboratory of Michael Barnett at MIT.|$|R
5000|$|Compugraphic {{produced}} <b>phototypesetting</b> <b>machines</b> in the 1970s {{that made}} it economically feasible for small publications to set their own type with professional quality. One model, the Compugraphic Compuwriter, uses a filmstrip wrapped around a drum that rotates at several hundred revolutions per minute. The filmstrip contains two fonts (a Roman and a bold or a Roman and an Italic) in one point size. To get different-sized fonts, the typesetter loads a different font strip or uses a 2x magnifying lens built into the machine, which doubles the size of font. The CompuWriter II automated the lens switch and let the operator use multiple settings. Other manufacturers of photo compositing machines include Alphatype, Varityper,Mergenthaler, Autologic, Berthold, Dymo, Harris (formerly Linotype's competitor [...] "Intertype"), Monotype, Star/Photon, Graphic Systems Inc., Hell AG, MGD Graphic Systems, and American Type Founders.|$|R
5000|$|The foundry's posterity is {{tainted by}} family maneuvers: after the war, Georges Peignot {{and four of}} his other {{brothers}} are dead (whose eldest died of illness in 1913); the potential successors are the two girls or the mother. The latter manages in 1919 to impose his surviving children or their widows an 1 million capital increase, given to a competitor, the Deberny foundry, in financial difficulty… which is the property of Jane's husband. In 1923, under the pen of Mr. Pascaut, notary, emerges a Deberny & Peignot company, result of the merger of Deberny (2.6 millions francs capital, 1 million Peignot's family included) and G. Peignot et Fils briefly renamed [...] "Peignot & Cie" [...] (4.1 millions francs). During half a century, Deberny & Peignot will struggle along, riding on its past glory, and goes out in 1974, bloodless, exposed to automatic typographic <b>machines</b> and <b>phototypesetting</b> <b>machines,</b> and a haphazard management.|$|R
5000|$|Others {{had noticed}} the sudden {{growth in the}} {{typesetting}} equipment market. One was Singer Corp. which set up a national sales force for typesetting and graphic arts equipment, including the <b>phototypesetting</b> <b>machines</b> made by another Massachusetts company, Graphic Systems Inc. These machines had a brief but spectacular run in the 1970s until someone at Singer asked {{what they were doing}} in the typesetting equipment business (which they knew nothing about), so little GSI was left to its own devices with no marketing organization. Singer had been responsible for providing the type font masters and the machines were getting a reputation for poor base line regularity. This may have been a hardware problem because strobe timing errors showed up as base line errors on the GSI machines, while on the Mergenthaler VIP such errors showed up between the characters, and unless fairly serious, escaped notice. GSI began producing excellent font masters and the machines continued to find a market. They built a minicomputer into the machine (a Nova), making it capable of setting justified, hyphenated type from a pure text input using a particularly convenient coding system that owed nothing to old Linotype practices. It allowed stored formats, or in-line codes. These machines held four fonts at a time, but had more characters per font than the VIP, so that the asterisks and other common characters were included. They used a rotating turret of lenses and a second [...] "doubler lens" [...] to offer a range of sizes from 5 to 72 points. The GSI machines were particularly popular with the in-house typesetting departments that began to grow in most larger companies. Clark E. Coffee ...|$|R
40|$|This {{book does}} not mention TEX on any of its two hundred pages. However, I think {{publication}} of the review {{in the pages of}} TUGboat is justified. The famous exhortation [2, p. 303] “Go forth now and create masterpieces of the publishing art ” {{is as much a part}} of The TEXbook as the explanation of or. Thus discussions about the art of the book are relevant for TUG publications, and we will continue reviewing books about publishing, typography and typesetting. This collection of essays by Jerry Kelly is a good example of them. Of course, the fact that the last chapter in the book is written about the Wizard of Fonts, permanent honorary board member of TUG, Hermann Zapf, only adds to the allure of this book for TEX users. The last century saw many quick changes in the technology of book making. At its beginning, most typographers used letterpress. Hot metal <b>machines,</b> <b>phototypesetting,</b> offset printing and other inventions came and went, to be supplanted today by digital typography. Book making was deeply influenced by these changes. The tumultuous history of society and art in 20 th century was another source of influence for the old art of typography. Thus writing about book making in this period is a very difficult — but a very interesting — task. Jerry Kelly approaches his subject with a biographical method. His book is a collection of short essays about the leading typographers of the las...|$|R
