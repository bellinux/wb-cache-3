50|$|Originally {{known as}} the Empire Arcade, the {{building}} was designed by Nahum Barnet and constructed in 1906. It housed {{a variety of different}} uses, with a dead-end retail arcade at ground level and 'rooms' above, accommodating over the years the usual array of specialist uses found in city buildings such as a cafe on the first floor, a ladies training college, a dressmaker, a tailor, a <b>poultry</b> <b>specialist,</b> and a meeting room for hire. The Empire Arcade was nearly gutted by a spectacular fire in 1923, resulting in losses exceeding at £70,000 but it was quickly rebuilt in the following years. In 1955 it was purchased by the adjacent Mutual Store, and underwent a range of modifications. These included absorbing the arcade space, creation of entries through the party wall, the reconfiguration of entries and internal circulation, and the addition of a modern canopy. In 1965, the store closed and the two buildings became the city home of the College of Advanced Education (CAE) for 40 years. The Mutual Store and the Empire Building were redeveloped by the developer Baycrown and architects ClarkeHopkinsClarke, beginning in 2001. The redevelopment was finished in 2006. Designed by ClarkeHopkinsClarke Architects, a small front section of the Empire Building was retained, and a 14 storey tower added behind. Retail spaces still take up the entirety of the ground floor, albeit no longer in an arcade format. The rest of the project is given over to small to medium-sized apartments. Because of the poor state of the building’s façade, the developer contracted a specialist firm to rebuild the mouldings, urns, and other features, and the original sandy yellow colour of the building was painted over in grey. This redevelopment required the balancing of heritage guidelines, commercial imperatives and the City of Melbourne Planning Scheme. Council required the retention of the street canopies to Flinders Street to provide continuous street shelter for pedestrians and to create an active edge to both Flinders and Degraves Street.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{comprehensive}} {{survey was}} made to determine the type, amount, and cost of fuel used in growing poultry in the United States. Information was obtained from many sources including 16 broiler, 13 layer, 9 turkey and 4 duck integrators, individual growers, Cooperative Extension <b>poultry</b> <b>specialists,</b> state, regional, and national poultry associations, the Alabama Power Company, and USDA statistics. The type and amount of fuel used varied among {{regions of the country}} and with the type of poultry. Liquified petroleum (LP) gas was used in growing slightly more than four-fifths of the poultry. Other fuels used were natural gas, fuel oil, and coal. Total fuel used for brooding all types of poultry produced 1. 95 X 101 6 joules (1. 85 X 101 3 BTU) of energy per year. Estimated cost of fuel for growing poultry was approximately 55 million dollars. Follow-up studies during die winter of 1976 — 77 indicated an approximately 2 % reduction in total fuel usage and a 10 % increase in price. Further reductions in amount used are possible and are occurring each year. However, the rate of improvement will be influenced by severity of weather and management trends...|$|R
40|$|Both Sir Arnold Theiler, {{appointed}} as Dean in 1920 when the Onderstepoort Veterinary Faculty was established, and Dr P J du Toit, who succeeded him in 1927, {{appear in the}} compound photograph {{of the class of}} 1926, constituting the 3 rd group of graduates. The probable reason for having 2 deans on the photograph, which was obviously composed from shots taken individually of the outgoing and incoming deans of the faculty as well as of each of the 7 graduates, is initially analysed in this paper. This is followed by short descriptions of the life histories of the graduates. The class of 1926 was probably unique in that 2 of its members, who were employees of the Onderstepoort Research Institute, were granted special permission to study veterinary science at the Faculty. After graduating, most of the class members spent the greater part of their careers as civil servants at Onderstepoort as researchers and part-time teachers in the Faculty, as was customary for many years, or as state veterinarians in the field. Private practice did not feature strongly with them. Noteworthy is that the class produced 3 outstanding scientists, i. e. a world class parasitologist, a very eminent pathologist and Onderstepoort's 1 st <b>poultry</b> <b>specialist...</b>|$|E
40|$|The CD {{starts with}} {{introduction}} by ILRI Director General Carlos Sere Then follows the seven interviews conducted by Brian Perry, ILRI Epidemiologist covering aspects {{and issues of}} the current Avian Flu situation, their experiences, national and regional surveillance as well as community surveillance and action. The representatives were from South East Asia (Robyn Alders, IRPC/KYEEMA Foundation; India (Santanu Bandopadhyay, Ministry of Agriculture; Nigeria (Daniel F Adene, Poultry Diseases Unit, Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Ibadan; Senegal (<b>Poultry</b> <b>specialist</b> E. Fallou Gueye ISRA/Family Poultry Network; Kenya (Catherine Wanjohi from Department of Veterinary Services); World Bank Adam lagerstedt; and South Africa (Celia Abolnik Ondeistepoort Veterinary Institute, Pretoria). The South East Asia representative talked about Laos, East Tumor. She states that Laos {{is one of the}} first countries to suffer the Bird Flu outbreak, which was in 2004. That it has small commercial industry and that people preferred village poultry. The outbreak was limited to commercial units, and that it was under control. The government's key efforts were also discussed. She indicated that in Laos no veterinarians are trained. There is luck of sufficient information and communication. Laos is still building capacity. Surveillance is one of the failures because of neglected veterinary services and education on basic sciences over many years. Community action was also discussed. The interview with India's representative started with geographical distribution of Bird Flu, and limitation to specific areas. It was indicated that it was a sudden outbreak in a district in a remote area commercial farm. Soon after, there was another outbreak in rural backyard poultries. The discussion included developing of national policies, and whom it involved. Other topics were - active laboratories, vaccination, strains imported, compensation to farmers on destroyed birds, depopulation, animal welfare, public health issues, mortalities, and community awareness. The third interviewee from Nigeria discusses cases of Bird Flu, mortality rate, diagnosis, outbreaks, training, lack of participation in surveillance, spreading mechanism, and recommendations. The representative from Senegal discusses the vulnerability of Avian Flu, preparedness, expertise, how avian flu affects the livelihood of the small farmers, risk of smuggled carcasses, role of migratory birds and water, compensation to farmers, education, training, and action. With the Kenyan representative the discussion was on role in preparedness, coordinating of activities, how effective was the surveillance system, capacity building in lab level, diagnosis methods, and bodies involved in the surveillance like the national museum which was involved in wild bird surveillance by collecting samples. He also stated that there is an active surveillance team for domestic poultry and birds, major risks are said to be migratory birds, and illegal importation. The discussion ends with what actions to be taken and control policies. The World Banks interview includes how word bank view the whole process including money and responsibility that it is not the lead agency internationally. WHO deals with the human side and FAO the other side. He stated that World Bank basically coordinates financial flow and donors & funding agencies. He mentioned that country strategy is used to allocate money and that reprogramming of funding is already in use. The discussion on South Africa is on the ongoing work which involved diagnosis and research in Avian Influenza. The discussion includes tracing the origin, mutation, strains in South Africa, Ostrich viruses, intensive farming system, identify how the virus come to the country, the surveillance program, lessons learnt, direct and indirect impact, increasing awareness, inadequate compensation, and coordination of surveillance. A summary of possible ways forward was presented by Tom Randolph, Agricultural economist at ILRI. He looked into how to develop policies to control Avian Flu, service needed to support different front line agencies, and indicates the research community can contribute by its expertise, lab capacity etc. and how to develop control policies, why and how can the community translate those lessons into better control efforts in the future. Front line agencies like, FOA, OIE and WHO and national institutes were reminded to prepare for and fight any outbreaks of the disease. It was mentioned that ILRI and IFPRI representing the CGIAR, would like to help to facilitate the process, help to get it started but not control or lead...|$|E
40|$|Ethnic or Religious {{intolerance}} {{in contemporary}} Nigeria {{is often a}} function of the effort to mobilize religion and ethnic rivalry to wrest limited resources that trickle down to the community level. In the absence of an effective policy to invest Nigerian petroleum resources, accountably, in infrastructures that provide employment and improved quality of life, members of diverse communities socially construct “insider ” and “outsider ” groups using religion and ethnicity to corner limited resources. This presentation shows how competing segments of a rural poor community were transformed into a corporate entity that protects the rights of all its constituents. It uses data collected from a multi-disciplinary micro-credit, small holder <b>poultry</b> grant. <b>Poultry</b> <b>Specialists</b> at the local Nigerian university, combined effort with an American nutritionist and an American anthropologist to bring practical up-to-date knowledge in micro-credit and poultry care to poor uneducated local community men and women of diverse religions. The presentation will show how this USAID funded Association Liaison Office grant strengthened the network of relationships in this community, thus assisting poor people to overcome ethnic and religious rivalry through improvement in economic resources and animal source food consumption in the community.

40|$|Poultry {{businesses}} and <b>poultry</b> industry <b>specialists</b> {{have known for}} years the value of specialized controlled lighting for stimulating bird growth and egg production. But the very low lighting level (usually 2 foot-candles or less) required for better egg production has often led to low worker productivity. Houses are windowless to control light, summer heat, winter heat loss and year-round ventilation. Well-designed artificial lighting systems allow workers to perform tasks easily, efficiently and safely. This is also true for related agri-industry processing plants often located in rural areas close to producers. Great emphasis placed on consumer protection and satisfaction brings strict sanitary practices in food processing facilities. Proper illumination helps achieve these objectives...|$|R
