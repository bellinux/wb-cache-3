5000|$|Whereas propositional attitudes {{approach}} is to analyze <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> internally, the [...] "location/access" [...] approach analyzes <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> externally, by their role. The term [...] "access" [...] refers to the statement of Liz Gutierrez that [...] "points <b>of</b> <b>views,</b> or perspectives, are ways of having access {{to the world and}} to ourselves", and the term [...] "location" [...] is in reference to the provided quotation of Jon Moline that <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> are [...] "ways <b>of</b> <b>viewing</b> things and events from certain locations". Moline rejects the notion that <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> are reducible to some rules based on some theories, maxims or dogmas. Moline considers the concept of [...] "location" [...] in two ways: in a direct way as a vantage point, and in an extended way, the way how a given vantage point provides a perspective, i.e., influences the perception.|$|R

5|$|From the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> of physics, spirals are lowest-energy {{configurations}} which emerge spontaneously through self-organizing {{processes in}} dynamic systems. From the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> of chemistry, a spiral {{can be generated}} by a reaction-diffusion process, involving both activation and inhibition. Phyllotaxis is controlled by proteins that manipulate the concentration of the plant hormone auxin, which activates meristem growth, alongside other mechanisms to control the relative angle of buds around the stem. From a biological perspective, arranging leaves as far apart as possible in any given space is favoured by natural selection as it maximises access to resources, especially sunlight for photosynthesis.|$|E

40|$|A {{system that}} allows people to {{simultaneously}} modify a common design in a graphically rich environment was developed to identify and examine groapware interface issues unique to three-dimensional computer-aided design. Experiments confirmed that a simultaneous mode of edit access is preferred over a turn-taking mode for two-person interactions. Also, independent <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> (e. g. isometric versus top view) between designers optimized parallel activity. Further experiments that aimed to transfer software-usage knowledge through the groupware system {{led to the development}} of the viewpoint. The viewpoint is a tool that indicates the <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> different designers as well as provides a method <b>of</b> <b>pointing</b> effective in an environment where arbitrary, contrasting <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>views</b> are allowed...|$|R
