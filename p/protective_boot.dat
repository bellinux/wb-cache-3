30|$|The NoBoots {{condition}} {{was expected to}} be one of the most effective conditions, since the feet are known as one of the most inefficient body regions for load carriage (Lind and McNicol 1968; Munson 1901; Turrell and Robinson 1943).

30|$|In a {{geometric}} sense, the head’s globe form is not {{suited for}} heat dissipation, which is beneficial in cold environments.

40|$|Introduction Many {{kinds of}} {{footwear}} {{are used for}} various purposes in the workplace in Japan. Careful selection of footwear is needed to protect workers from coldness {{and to keep the}} performance of workers in cold workplace where employees have to work under - 20 ℃. On the other hand, safety boots with high heat conductivity from foot to outside are needed for the workers in hot environments. But thermal characteristics are not shown for each boots. We measured the thermal insulation values of various kinds of footwear by thermal foot manikin. Materials and methods We tested 14 kinds of Japanese protective footwear (Midori Safety) with a thin or a thick sock in climate chamber by thermal foot manikin having 8 zones. The footwear included cold protective boots(2), long rubber boots(1), safety boots(4), safety shoes(2), business shoes(1), work sneakers(1), anti-electrostatic aerated shoes (2) and sandals (1). The ambient temperature of climate chamber was 4. 6 ± 0. 5 ℃. The air velocity near boot was 0. 27 ± 0. 5 m/sec. The boots were placed on a copper/zinc alloy plate in the climate chamber. When upper parts of foot manikin were not covered by footwear, muffler was wound around the foot manikin to avoid the unnecessary heat dissipation from manikin. The manikin skin temperature of each zones were set at 34 ℃ on the control software. Each test was run for about 80 minutes to reach steady state. The data registered during the last 10 minutes on PC were used to calculate the thermal resistance. In boot toe to L Calf data were used, in shoe foot and ankle data were used. We conform to ISO 15831 about the test methods. When the thermal resistance of the second measurement was not within the 4 % difference of that of first, the third measurement was done. The temperatures on the sock at the toe tip, the mid-sole, the dorsal foot, the guard front were measured by thermocouples which were fixed by surgical tape. Results and discussion In boots, thermal insulation with thick sock was larger than that with thin sock by 0. 014 - 0. 0033 m 2 ℃/W. The cold <b>protective</b> <b>boot</b> which had the inner sock with thick sock had the largest insulation, which was about 0. 45 m 2 ℃/W. The other kind of cold <b>protective</b> <b>boot</b> was 0. 325 m 2 ℃/W. Though the thermal resistances of normal safety boot were the same values of 0. 26 - 0. 27 m 2 ℃/W, safety boot whose material was fibrous leather made by cutting outer layer from normal leather was relatively lower value. Common rubber boot made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was lowest, 0. 215 m 2 ℃/W. In shoes, the thermal insulation of work sneaker was 0. 28 m 2 ℃/W, which was larger than business shoe, aerated shoe and sandal. The larger the aeration the shoes had, the smaller the temperature insulation. Temperature on sock in toe tip was smaller in sandal and aerated shoe than non-aerated work sneaker...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To {{explore the}} injury {{mechanism}} and prevent injuries {{for the military}} parachuting of cadet pilots, this paper investigated the injury risk factors. A prospective study of 59, 932 static line parachute descents by Chinese People’s Liberation Army cadet pilots (CPLACP), including 186 female cadet pilots with 391 jumps, was performed. Injury risk factors from administrative records included mental qualities, parachuting movements, surface wind speed, <b>protective</b> <b>boots,</b> and gender. Injury data were obtained from emergency room and hospital records. The study indicates that 153 CPLACP were injured, {{with a total of}} 168 injuries. The overall injury incidence on basic courses was 2. 6 / 1000 jumps. About 79. 7 % of the injuries were located in the lower limbs. The most commonly injured sites were ankle and knee, which was 39. 3 % and 19. 0 %, respectively, of all injuries occurred. Although the parachuting injury incidence of cadet pilots is smaller than paratroopers’, the potential risk for career-threatening or life-threatening injury is great. This risk can be reduced by appropriate training and attention to detail...|$|R
