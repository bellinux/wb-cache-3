40|$|Whilst most tax {{authorities}} {{throughout the world}} publish their organisation’s objectives and policies, hitherto, {{there is very little}} research investigating the attitudes of those at the “front line”, namely tax investigation officers.

Executive Summary An increasing number of regulators have adopted public disclosure programs to create incentives for pollution control. Previous empirical analyses on monitoring <b>and</b> <b>enforcement</b> issues have focused their attention strictly on studying the impact of the traditional monitoring (inspections) <b>and</b> <b>enforcement</b> (fines <b>and</b> <b>penalties)</b> practices on the environmental performance of polluters.

An important empirical issue at hand is whether or not these programs can create incentives in addition to the incentives normally set in place through traditional means of enforcement such as fines <b>and</b> <b>penalties.</b> In this paper, we perform an empirical analysis of the impact of both traditional <b>enforcement</b> <b>and</b> information strategies {{within the context of a}} single program.

50|$|Responding, Graham {{stressed}} that the issue was not a party one (and was borne out on this by the other speakers in the debate); although the problem was a national one, the government would for the moment bring forward measures only for the two areas of education {{in which the state}} already had some involvement; the education of workhouse children and the education of factory children. The measures he announced related to England and Wales; Scotland had an established system of parochial schools run by its established church, with little controversy, since in Scotland there was no dissent on doctrine, only on questions of discipline. In the 'education clauses' of his Factory Education Bill of 1843, he proposed to make government loans to a new class of government factory schools effectively {{under the control of the}} Church of England and the local magistrates. The default religious education in these schools would be Anglican, but parents would be allowed to opt their children out of anything specifically Anglican; if the opt-out was exercised, religious education would be as in the best type of Dissenter-run schools. Once a trust school was open in a factory district, factory children in that district would have to provide a certificate that they were being educated at it or at some other school certified as 'efficient'. The 'labour clauses' forming the other half of the bill were essentially a revival of Fox Maule's draft; children could work only in the morning or in the afternoon, but not both.
