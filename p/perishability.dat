25|$|In produce, {{microorganisms}} {{attach to}} the surfaces and biofilms develop internally. During the washing process, biofilms resist sanitization and allow bacteria to spread across the produce. This problem {{is also found in}} ready to eat foods because the foods go through limited cleaning procedures before consumption Due to the <b>perishability</b> of dairy products and limitations in cleaning procedures, resulting in the buildup of bacteria, dairy is susceptible to biofilm formation and contamination. The bacteria can spoil the products more readily and contaminated products pose a health risk to consumers. One bacteria that can be found in various industries and is a major cause of foodborne disease is Salmonella. Large amounts of salmonella contamination {{can be found in the}} poultry processing industry as about 50% of salmonella strains can produce biofilms on poultry farms. Salmonella increases the risk of foodborne illnesses when the poultry products are not cleaned and cooked correctly. Salmonella is also found in the seafood industry where biofilms form from seafood borne pathogens on the seafood itself as well as in water. Shrimp products are commonly affected by salmonella because of unhygienic processing and handling techniques The preparation practices of shrimp and other seafood products can allow for bacteria buildup on the products.|$|E

500|$|One of four {{surviving}} Bruegel {{paintings in}} distemper, {{the work is}} a tüchlein, a type of light painting that uses tempera made from pigment mixed with water-soluble glue. This medium was widely used in painting and manuscript illumination {{before the advent of}} oil paint. [...] It is not known from whom Bruegel learnt its use, but amongst those speculated are his mother-in-law, illuminator Mayken Verhulst; his teacher Pieter Coecke van Aelst; and painter and illuminator Giulio Clovio, with whom he resided in Italy and whom he helped paint miniatures in distemper. Due to the high <b>perishability</b> of linen cloth and the solubility of hide glue, tüchleins do not preserve well and are difficult to restore. [...] The Blind Leading the Blind is in good condition and has suffered no more than some erosion, such as of a herdsman and some fowl in the middle ground. [...] The grain of the linen canvas is visible beneath the delicate brushstrokes. [...] The work is signed and dated BRVEGEL.M.D.LX.VIII. [...] The painting measures , the largest of 1568.|$|E
2500|$|This {{idea was}} first {{challenged}} by Clayton and Dickinson {{in their work}} with the western scrub jay (Aphelocoma californica). They were able to demonstrate that these birds may possess an episodic-like memory system as they found that they remember where they cached different food types, and discriminately recovered them depending on the <b>perishability</b> of the item and time that elapsed since caching. Thus, scrub-jays appear to remember the [...] "what-where-and-when" [...] of specific past caching events. The authors argued that such performance meets the behavioral criteria for episodic memory, but referred to the ability as [...] "episodic-like" [...] memory because {{the study did not}} address the phenomenological aspects of episodic memory.|$|E
2500|$|Dutch {{interest}} in the wine trade prompted advancement in winemaking styles and technology. One problem that plagued the French wine trade was the <b>perishability</b> of wine which rarely survived longer than the next vintage. French wine during this period was often unbalanced and unstable, being not properly clarified during wine making and lacking the alcohol needed to preserve the wine. This was of concern to the Dutch who would sometimes be delayed in their trading with ports along the Baltic and White Seas when they became impassable in the winter. To ward off spoilage the Dutch developed methods of fortification by adding brandy to the wine to stop fermentation and increase the life expectancy of the wine. The Dutch further introduced to the French a method of sulfuring the wines (known as allumettes hollandaises) which {{has the effect of}} stabilizing the wine and preventing some degree of spoilage. The introduction of new Dutch winemaking techniques helped antiquated methods {{such as the use of}} lead fall into disuse. Used since the days of Ancient Rome, lead was used in regions such as Poitou to help sweeten and preserve some of their wines leading to various ailments that collectively were known as the [...] "Poitou colic". [...] By the end of the 17th century, most Poitou winemakers had stopped using lead in their wine production.|$|E
2500|$|The {{widespread}} use of refrigeration allowed for {{a vast amount of}} new agricultural opportunities to open up in the United States. [...] New markets emerged throughout the United States in areas that were previously uninhabited and far-removed from heavily populated areas. New agricultural opportunity presented itself in areas that were considered rural such as states in the south and in the west. [...] Shipments on a large scale from the south and California were both made around the same time although natural ice was used from the Sierras in California rather than manufactured ice in the south. [...] Refrigeration allowed for many areas to specialize in the growing of specific fruits. California specialized in several fruits, grapes, peaches, pears, plums, and apples while Georgia became famous for specifically its peaches. In California, the acceptance of the refrigerated rail carts lead to an increase of car loads from 4,500 carloads in 1895 to between 8,000 and 10,000 carloads in 1905. [...] The Gulf States, Arkansas, Missouri and Tennessee entered into strawberry production on a large-scale while Mississippi became the center of the tomato industry. New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, and Nevada grew cantaloupes. [...] Without refrigeration this would have not been possible. By 1917, well-established fruit and vegetable areas that were close to eastern markets felt the pressure of competition from these distant specialized centers. [...] Refrigeration was not limited to meat, fruit and vegetables but it also encompassed dairy product and dairy farms. In the early twentieth century large cities got their dairy supply from farms as far as 400 miles. [...] Dairy products were not as easily transported great distances like fruits and vegetables due to greater <b>perishability.</b> [...] Refrigeration made production possible in the west far from eastern markets, so much in fact that dairy farmers could pay transportation cost and still undersell their eastern competitors. [...] Refrigeration and the refrigerated rail gave opportunity to areas with rich soil far from natural channel of transport such as a river, valley trail or harbors.|$|E
60|$|The curious {{may learn}} in Dr. Sierich's book the {{unexpected}} sequel of the tale. Here {{is enough for}} my purpose. Though the man was but new dead, the ghost was already putrefied, as though putrefaction were the mark and of {{the essence of a}} spirit. The vigil on the Paumotuan grave does not extend beyond two weeks, and they told me this period was thought to coincide with that of the resolution of the body. The ghost always marked with decay--the danger seemingly ending with the process of dissolution--here is tempting matter for the theorist. But it will not do. The lady of the flowers had been long dead, and her spirit was still supposed to bear the brand of <b>perishability.</b> The Resident had been more than a fortnight buried, and his vampire was still supposed to go the rounds.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was from}} a truth deeply mystical that Hawthorne {{declared}} against any sort of permanence in the dwellings of men, and held that each generation should newly house itself. He preferred the <b>perishability</b> of the wooden American house to the durability of the piles of brick or stone which in Europe affected him as with some moral miasm from the succession of sires and sons and grandsons that had died out of them. But even of such structures as these it is impressive how little the earth makes {{with the passage of}} time. Where once a great city of them stood, you shall find a few tottering walls, scarcely more mindful of the past than [...] "the cellar and the well" [...] which Holmes marked as the ultimate monuments, the last witnesses, to the existence of our more transitory habitations. It is the law of the patient sun that everything under it shall decay, and if by reason of some swift calamity, some fiery cataclysm, the perishable shall be overtaken by a fate that fixes it in unwasting arrest, it cannot be felt that the law has been set aside in the interest of men's happiness or cheerfulness. Neither Pompeii nor Herculaneum invites the gayety of the spectator, who as he walks their disinterred thoroughfares has the weird sense of taking a former civilization out of storage, and the ache of finding it wholly unadapted to the actual world. As far as his comfort is concerned, it had been far better that those cities had not been stored, but had fallen to the ruin that has overtaken all their contemporaries.|$|E

50|$|White ash {{is one of}} {{the most}} used trees for {{everyday}} purposes and, to keep up with high demand, is cultivated almost everywhere it can be. The wood is white and quite dense (within 20% of 670 kg/m3), strong, and straight-grained. It is the timber of choice for production of baseball bats and tool handles. The wood is also favorable for furniture and flooring. Woodworkers use the timber mainly for interior uses due to high <b>perishability</b> in contact with ground soil. It is also used to make lobster traps. Since the 1950s, it has also become a popular choice for solid electric guitar bodies. It makes a very servicable longbow if properly worked. The wood was used in ceiling fan blades from the 1970s through the mid-1980s, though cane was sometimes simulated with plastic then. It is no longer used for ceiling fan blades in most countries.|$|E

50|$|Woodrats {{have great}} {{adaptability}} in their feeding habits. They feed on almost {{any kind of}} plant material including leaves, roots and tubers, wood, bark, stems, and seeds. Although the Eastern Woodrats eat mostly green vegetation, they also eat various types of fruits, nuts, fungi, ferns, and seeds. Food preferences vary between individuals, populations and geographic areas. In Texas, pecan nuts are a major food source; in Tennessee, mint and beechnuts {{were found to be}} the most cached item; in Pennsylvania, mushrooms were one of the top food items. Acorns are a major food source for all woodrat populations, as oak trees are found throughout its range and acorns can be stored for a long time. Energy and <b>perishability</b> influence the woodrat’s diet and caching. The value of food when consumed should equal or exceed the cost of gathering and storage. Food is chosen by dryness and degree of microbial infection. Woodrats tend to eat perishable food and cache less perishable foods, thus reducing the risk of loss to spoilage.|$|E
5000|$|Glue-size is a {{painting}} technique in which pigment is bound (sized) to cloth (usually linen) with hide glue, and typically the unvarnished cloth was then {{fixed to the}} frame using the same glue. Glue-size {{is also known as}} distemper, though the term [...] "distemper" [...] is applied variously to different techniques. Glue-size was used because hide glue was a popular binding medium in the 15th century, particularly among artists of the Early Netherlandish period, who used it as an inexpensive alternative to oil. Although a large number of works using this medium were produced, few survive today, mainly because of the high <b>perishability</b> of linen cloth and the solubility of hide glue. Well-known and relatively well-preserved — though substantially damaged — the most notable examples include Quentin Matsys' Virgin and Child with Saints Barbara and Catherine (c. 1515-25) and Dirk Bouts' Entombment (c. 1440-55). In German the technique is known as Tüchleinfarben, meaning “small cloth colours”, or Tüchlein, derived from the German words Tüch and Lein ("fabric" [...] and [...] "flax").|$|E
