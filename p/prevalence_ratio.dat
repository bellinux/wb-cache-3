40|$|Introduction: Determining the {{predictors}} {{of demand for}} emergency prehospital care can assist ambulance services in undertaking policy and planning activities. Hypothesis: Demand for prehospital care {{can be explained by}} demographic, health status, and economic determinants. Methods: The study used a cross-sectional design to investigate the association of demographic, health status, and insurance factors with the use of prehospital, ambulance care. Core data items including age, gender, marital status, country of origin, triage score, diagnosis, time of presentation, method of arrival, and patient disposition were collected for every patient who pre-sented at the Emergency Department of the study hospital over a four-month period. Ambulance usage was analysed using Poisson regression. Results: For the 10, 229 patients surveyed, only a small number were triaged as having the highest level of urgent medical need (0. 8 %), but the majority of these used prehospital emergency medical care (90. 2 %). Predictors of ambulance use included age > 65 years (<b>Prevalence</b> <b>Ratio</b> [Prevalence Ratio] = 2. 92; 95 % confidence interval [Confidence Interval]: 2. 35 - 3. 63), being married or in a defacto relationship (<b>Prevalence</b> <b>Ratio</b> = 0. 69; 95 % Confidence Interval: 0. 60 - 0. 79) or divorced, separated, or widowed (<b>Prevalence</b> <b>Ratio</b> = 0. 83; 95 % Confidence Interval: 0. 70 - 0. 98), triage score level 1 or 2 (<b>Prevalence</b> <b>Ratio</b> = 1. 95; 95 % Confidence Interval: 1. 68 - 2. 28), or triage score level 3 (<b>Prevalence</b> <b>Ratio</b> = 1. 54; 95 % Confidence Interval: 1. 38 - 1. 72), diagnosis involving either mental (<b>Prevalence</b> <b>Ratio</b> = 4. 29; 95 % Confidence Interval: 1. 84 - 10. 01), nervous (<b>Prevalence</b> <b>Ratio</b> = 2. 74; 95 % Confidence Interval: 1. 19 - 6. 31) or trauma (<b>Prevalence</b> <b>Ratio</b> = 2. 33; 95 % Confidence Interval: 1. 03 - 5. 27) conditions, and insurance status (<b>Prevalence</b> <b>Ratio</b> = 1. 54; 95 % Confidence Interval: 1. 40 - 1. 71).

40|$|Abstract Background HPV DNA {{diagnostic}} tests for epidemiology monitoring (research purpose) or cervical cancer screening (clinical purpose) {{have often been}} considered separately. Women with positive Linear Array (LA) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) research test results typically are neither informed nor referred for colposcopy. Recently, a sequential testing by using Hybrid Capture 2 (HC 2) HPV clinical test as a triage before genotype by LA has been adopted for monitoring HPV infections. Also, HC 2 has been reported as a more feasible screening approach for cervical cancer in low-resource countries. Thus, knowing the performance of testing strategies incorporating HPV clinical test (i. e., HC 2 -only or using HC 2 as a triage before genotype by LA) compared with LA-only testing in measuring HPV prevalence will be informative for public health practice. Method We conducted a Monte Carlo simulation study. Data were generated using mathematical algorithms. We designated the reported HPV infection prevalence in the U. S. and Latin America as the “true” underlying type-specific HPV prevalence. Analytical sensitivity of HC 2 for detecting 14 high-risk (oncogenic) types {{was considered to be}} less than LA. Estimated-to-true <b>prevalence</b> <b>ratios</b> and percentage reductions were calculated. Results When the “true” HPV prevalence was designated as the reported prevalence in the U. S., with LA genotyping sensitivity and specificity of (0. 95, 0. 95), estimated-to-true <b>prevalence</b> <b>ratios</b> of 14 high-risk types were 2. 132, 1. 056, 0. 958 for LA-only, HC 2 -only, and sequential testing, respectively. Estimated-to-true <b>prevalence</b> <b>ratios</b> of two vaccine-associated high-risk types were 2. 359 and 1. 063 for LA-only and sequential testing, respectively. When designated type-specific prevalence of HPV 16 and 18 were reduced by 50  %, using either LA-only or sequential testing, prevalence estimates were reduced by 18  %. Conclusion Estimated-to-true HPV infection <b>prevalence</b> <b>ratios</b> using LA-only testing strategy are generally higher than using HC 2 -only or using HC 2 as a triage before genotype by LA. HPV clinical testing can be incorporated to monitor HPV prevalence or vaccine effectiveness. Caution is needed when comparing apparent prevalence from different testing strategies...|$|R

We assessed differences in hypertension prevalence and its management among relatively homogenous African migrants (Ghanaians) living in three European cities (Amsterdam, London, and Berlin) and nonmigrants living in rural and urban Ghana. A multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted among Ghanaian adults (n =  5659) aged 25 - 70 years. Comparisons between sites were made using prevalence ratios with adjustment for age, education, and BMI. The age-standardised prevalence of hypertension was 22 and 28 % in rural Ghanaian men and women. The prevalence was higher in urban Ghana [men, 34 %; adjusted <b>prevalence</b> <b>ratio</b> =  1. 37, 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1. 10 - 1. 70]; and much higher in migrants in Europe, especially in Berlin (men, 57 %; <b>prevalence</b> <b>ratio</b> =  2. 21, 1. 78 - 2. 73; women, 51 %; <b>prevalence</b> <b>ratio</b> =  1. 74, 1. 45 - 2. 09) than in rural Ghana. Hypertension awareness and treatment levels were higher in Ghanaian migrants than in nonmigrant Ghanaians. However, adequate hypertension control was lower in Ghanaian migrant men in Berlin (20 %; <b>prevalence</b> <b>ratio</b> =  0. 43 95 %, 0. 23 - 0. 82), Amsterdam (29 %; <b>prevalence</b> <b>ratio</b> =  0. 59, 0. 35 - 0. 99), and London (36 %; <b>prevalence</b> <b>ratio</b> =  0. 86, 0. 49 - 1. 51) than rural Ghanaians (59 %).

METHODS: Totally 5 353 residents were selected and researched by randomized cluster sampling {{in the major}} Li Miao minority areas of Hainan province. Ocular examination and lachrymal duct flushing were carried out, and questionnaire survey on lachrymal duct obstruction was conducted. The ratio of lachrymal duct obstruction diseases and group distribution characteristics were analyzed based on above research. RESULTS: The prevalence ratios of lachrymal duct obstruction was 4. 47 % in major Li Miao minority areas of Hainan province, with 2. 62 % in urban area, and 5. 93 % in rural area respectively. Prevalence ratios {{of men and women}} group were 1. 69 % and 6. 39 % correspondingly. Difference between the two groups was statistically significant(χ 2 = 67. 2821, P = 0. 0000).

We aimed {{to compare the}} prevalence of BAVMs in first-degree relatives (FDRs) of patients with BAVM and the prevalence in the general population. METHODS: We sent a postal questionnaire to 682 patients diagnosed with a BAVM in 1 of 4 university hospitals to retrieve information about the occurrence of BAVMs among their FDRs. We calculated a <b>prevalence</b> <b>ratio</b> using the BAVM prevalence among FDRs and the prevalence from a Scottish population-based study (93 per 628 788 adults). A <b>prevalence</b> <b>ratio</b> of >/= 9 with a lower limit of the 95 % confidence interval of 3 was considered indicative of a shared familial risk factor. RESULTS: Informed consent was given by 460 (67 %) patients, who had 2992 FDRs. We identified 3 patients with a FDR with a BAVM, yielding a <b>prevalence</b> <b>ratio</b> of 6. 8 (95 % CI, 2. 2 - 21). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of BAVMs in FDRs of patients with a BAVM was increased but did not meet our prespecified criterion for a shared familial risk factor. In combination with the low absolute risk of a BAVM in FDRs, our results do not support screening of FDRs for BAVMs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In 1995, an {{outbreak}} of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occurred in the central Paraguayan chaco. The primary reservoir of the virus, Laguna Negra virus, was identified as the vesper mouse, Calomys laucha. Over a 15 -month period, we collected 1, 090 small mammals at 12 locations representing 4 habitats common in the central Paraguayan chaco. Calomys laucha was common in agricultural habitats and uncommon in the native forest habitat. Populations of C. laucha were greater {{during the dry season}} months and declined during the wet season. A total of 643 small mammals were tested for antibodies cross-reactive to Sin Nombre virus. All of the antibody-positive animals were C. laucha (crude antibody <b>prevalence</b> <b>ratio</b> 12. 1 % [25 of 206]). Antibody <b>prevalence</b> <b>ratio</b> increased with body size and was more common among male (18 %; n 115) than among female (4 %; n 96) vesper mice. Antibody <b>prevalence</b> <b>ratio</b> was highest among animals from cropland habitats (18 %; n 72), followed by thorn scrub (13 %; n 46) and pastureland (7 %; n 81) and may be positively correlated to the proportion of C. laucha in the small mammal community. These data suggest that community-level dynamics, in addition to population-level dynamics, may be involved in the transmission of the virus through natural populations of vesper mice...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine changes over time in the female: male HIV <b>prevalence</b> <b>ratio</b> in 18 {{countries}} in Sub-Saharan Africa, overall and when stratified by area of residence, educational attainment and marital status. Methodology: We used data from the Demographic and Health Surveys, which are nationally representative household surveys. By using data from 18 countries with at least two survey rounds with HIV testing, and dividing the countries into three regions (Western/Central, Eastern and Southern) we were able to examine cross-country and regional changes in the female: male HIV <b>prevalence</b> <b>ratio</b> over time. Logistic regression was used to estimate female: male HIV prevalence ratios in urban versus rural areas and for different categories of education and marital status. To assess changes over time, we compared the confidence intervals of the prevalence ratios. Results: The female: male HIV <b>prevalence</b> <b>ratio</b> was above one in all countries in at least one survey round for both ages 15 – 24 years and 25 – 49 years. In 13 out of 18 countries the <b>prevalence</b> <b>ratio</b> was higher for the younger age group compared to the age group 25 – 49 years (3 significant) and this difference in prevalence ratios between the age groups did not change over time. Overall, there was a higher frequency of increasing than decreasing prevalence ratios. The gender disparity was greater among those who were married/living together than among the never-married, and over time, the ratio was more stable among the married/living together. The study found no clear differential changes by education. Conclusion: Women continue to carry the greater burden of HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa and there is no clear pattern of change in the gap between men and women as the direction and magnitude of change in the prevalence ratios varied greatly. </p...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{provide the}} first Australian {{population-based}} {{estimates of the}} association between bullying and adverse mental health outcomes and suicidality among Australian adolescents. METHOD: Analysis of data from 3537 adolescents, aged 14 - 15 [*]years from Wave 6 of the K-cohort of Longitudinal Study of Australian Children was conducted. We used Poisson and linear regression to estimate associations between bullying type (none, relational-verbal, physical, both types) and role (no role, victim, bully, victim and bully), and mental health (measured by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, symptoms of anxiety and depression) and suicidality. RESULTS: Adolescents involved in bullying had significantly increased Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, depression and anxiety scores in all bullying roles and types. In terms of self-harm and suicidality, bully-victims had the highest risk of self-harm (<b>prevalence</b> rate <b>ratio</b> 4. 7, 95 % confidence interval [3. 26, 6. 83]), suicidal ideation (<b>prevalence</b> rate <b>ratio</b> 4. 3, 95 % confidence interval [2. 83, 6. 49]), suicidal plan (<b>prevalence</b> rate <b>ratio</b> 4. 1, 95 % confidence interval [2. 54, 6. 58]) and attempts (<b>prevalence</b> rate <b>ratio</b> 2. 7, 95 % confidence interval [1. 39, 5. 13]), followed by victims then bullies. The experience of both relational-verbal and physical bullying {{was associated with the}} highest risk of self-harm (<b>prevalence</b> rate <b>ratio</b> 4. 6, 95 % confidence interval [3. 15, 6. 60]), suicidal ideation or plans (<b>prevalence</b> rate <b>ratio</b> 4. 6, 95 % confidence interval [3. 05, 6. 95]; and 4. 8, 95 % confidence interval [3. 01, 7. 64], respectively) or suicide attempts (<b>prevalence</b> rate <b>ratio</b> 3. 5, 95 % confidence interval [1. 90, 6. 30]). CONCLUSION: This study presents the first national, population-based estimates of the associations between bullying by peers and mental health outcomes in Australian adolescents. The markedly increased risk of poor mental health outcomes, self-harm and suicidal ideation and behaviours among adolescents who experienced bullying highlights the importance of addressing bullying in school settings.

40|$|Limited data {{on smoking}} {{prevalence}} allowing valid between-country comparison {{are available in}} Europe. The {{aim of this study}} is to provide data on smoking prevalence and its determinants in 18 European countries. In 2010, within the Pricing Policies And Control of Tobacco in Europe (PPACTE) project, we conducted a face-to-face survey on smoking in 18 European countries (Albania, Austria, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Croatia, England, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain and Sweden) on a total of 18 056 participants, representative for each country of the population aged 15 years or older. Overall, 27. 2 % of the participants were current smokers (30. 6 % of men and 24. 1 % of women). Smoking prevalence was highest in Bulgaria (40. 9 %) and Greece (38. 9 %) and lowest in Italy (22. 0 %) and Sweden (16. 3 %). Smoking prevalence ranged between 15. 7 % (Sweden) and 44. 3 % (Bulgaria) for men and between 11. 6 % (Albania) and 38. 1 % (Ireland) for women. Multivariate analysis showed a significant inverse trend between smoking prevalence and the level of education in both sexes. Male-to-female smoking <b>prevalence</b> <b>ratios</b> ranged from 0. 85 in Spain to 3. 47 in Albania and current-to-ex <b>prevalence</b> <b>ratios</b> ranged from 0. 68 in Sweden to 4. 28 in Albania. There are considerable differences across Europe in smoking prevalence, and male-to-female and current-to-ex smoking <b>prevalence</b> <b>ratios.</b> Eastern European countries, lower income countries and those with less advanced tobacco control policies have less favourable smoking patterns and are at an earlier stage of the tobacco epidemic...|$|R
