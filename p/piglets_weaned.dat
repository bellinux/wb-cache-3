40|$|This study {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that late weaning {{and the availability of}} creep feed during the suckling period compared with early weaning, improves feed intake, decreases stress and improves the integrity of the intestinal tract. In this study with 160 piglets of 16 litters, late weaning at 7 weeks of age was compared with early weaning at 4 weeks, with or without creep feeding during the suckling period, on post-weaning feed intake, plasma cortisol (as an indicator of stress) and plasma intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP; a marker for mild intestinal injury) concentrations, intestinal morphology, intestinal (macro) molecular permeability and intestinal fluid absorption as indicators of small intestinal integrity. Post-weaning feed intake was similar in <b>piglets</b> <b>weaned</b> at 4 weeks and offered creep feed or not, but higher (P < 0. 001) in <b>piglets</b> <b>weaned</b> at 7 weeks with a higher (P < 0. 05) intake for piglets offered creep feed compared with piglets from whom creep feed was witheld. Plasma cortisol response at the day of weaning was lower in <b>piglets</b> <b>weaned</b> at 7 weeks compared with <b>piglets</b> <b>weaned</b> at 4 weeks, and creep feed did not affect cortisol concentration. Plasma I-FABP concentration was not affected by the age of weaning and creep feeding. Intestinal (macro) molecular permeability was not affected by the age of weaning and creep feeding. Both in uninfected and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli-infected small intestinal segments net fluid absorption was not affected by the age of weaning or creep feeding. Creep feeding, but not the age of weaning, resulted in higher villi and increased crypt depth. In conclusion, weaning at 7 weeks of age in combination with creep feeding improves post-weaning feed intake and reduces weaning stress but does not improve functional characteristics of the small intestinal mucos...|$|E

Group I (control) received standard feed mixture containing soybean meal as the main protein source, group II – RPC mixed with fodder pea, group III – field bean, group IV – blue lupine, group V – yellow lupine. <b>Weaned</b> <b>piglets</b> received mixtures containing RPC and legume mixtures. Considerable {{differences were found in}} amino acid composition of proteins. Differences in the apparent digestibility of essential nutrients were statistically insignificant. Sows fed with field bean and yellow lupine gave birth to heaviest <b>piglets.</b> After <b>weaning</b> <b>piglets</b> receiving field bean were characterized by the best weight gains. It is concluded that mixing rapeseed cake with legume seeds allows for the complete replacement of soybean meal in sow diets and for partial replacement in piglet diets...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} dietary {{inclusion}} {{levels of the}} association of glutamine with glutamic acid (AminoGut: AmG) on the performance, gastrointestinal morphophysiology, and diarrhea incidence of <b>piglets</b> <b>weaned</b> at 21 days of age were evaluated. In the experiment, 120 piglets with 6. 24 ± 1. 00 kg initial weight were distributed according to a randomized block experimental design into five treatments with six replicates of four animals each. The following treatments were applied: negative control diet (0 % AmG); 0. 5 % AmG; 1. 0 % AmG; 1. 5 % AmG; positive control diet (0 % AmG, 4 % inclusion of porcine plasma). The inclusion of 1. 0 % AmG, as compared to the positive control diet, improved weight gain, feed intake and feed conversion ratio. The lowest diarrhea score was observed when 1. 0 % AmG was included, whereas the best villus height and villus:crypt ratio were obtained with the inclusion of 0. 82 % AmG. Villus height, crypt depth, and villus:crypt ratio values obtained with 1. 0 % AmG were similar to those obtained with the positive control diet, except in the period of 21 to 28 days, when the diet with 1. 0 % AmG promoted higher villus:crypt ratio. The supplementation of 0. 5 and 1. 0 % AmG affected organ weights, and reduced digestive content pH in the pylorus and in the ileum relative to the positive control diet. The dietary supplementation of 1 % glutamine associated with glutamic acid improves the performance and the morphophysiology of <b>piglets</b> <b>weaned</b> at 21 days of age...|$|E
40|$|The {{immediate}} post-weaning period {{characterized by}} reduced feed intake induces gut structural alterations. A rapid mucosa restoration {{is essential for}} an optimal growth recovery in piglets. Bovine colostrum {{has been shown to}} prevent villous atrophy in mice and to stimulate mucosal healing in patients suffering from inflammatory gut disease. Therefore we evaluated the influence of bovine colostrum on mucosa restoration in weaned piglets. In trial 1, twenty-four <b>piglets</b> <b>weaned</b> at 21 days of age were fed a control diet or a diet supplemented with bovine colostrum for 7 or 14 days. Duodenal villous sizes and crypt cell proliferation were analysed. In trial 2, three <b>piglets</b> <b>weaned</b> at 28 days of age were fasted for 48 h. At slaughter duodenal explants were prepared and incubated for 24 h in medium containing BSA (control) or bovine colostrum. After RNA extraction from cultured tissues, real time PCR was performed in order to quantify the transcription of genes involved in proliferation (Proliferative Cellular Nucleic Antigen,PCNA), migration (Trefoil Factor 3, TFF 3) and pro- and anti-apoptotic (Bax and Bcl-xl, respectively) pathways. In trial 1, bovine colostrum-supplemented diet increased duodenal villous perimeter (+ 8 %; Pb 0. 05), but not crypt cell proliferation, whereas it numerically increased the duodenal mucosa/muscularis ratio (+ 18 %; P= 0. 19). In trial 2, transcription of TFF 3 (+ 228 %; P= 0. 07) and Bcl-xl (+ 62 %; Pb 0. 01) genes was greater in presence of colostrum. Hence, bovine colostrum improved mucosa restoration by stimulating migration and limiting apoptosis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Body {{measurements}} and certain reproductive indexes {{were computed for}} a Bazna population kept at SCDA Turda as genetic stock. Values were compared to those reported in 1999 when this population was last analyzed. The data has induced us to conclude that breeding and selection have {{lead to an increase}} in both height at withers and rump proving that this breed has been improved toward meat production. Prolificacy and piglet weight at birth are within breed standards but closer to the lower limit. The weight of <b>piglets</b> <b>weaned</b> at 56 days is above 11 kg, which represents a good start for their growth. A negative element is the high piglet mortality before weaning...|$|E
40|$|The {{immediate}} post-weaning {{period is}} one of the most stressful phases in a pig's life, and during this period, piglets are usually exposed to environmental, social and psychological stressors which have direct or indirect effects on gut health and overall growth performance. In this review, the impact of husbandry practices on gut health outcomes and performance of piglets is discussed. Husbandry practices in the swine barn generally include nutrition and management practices, maintenance of hygienic standards and disease prevention protocols, and animal welfare considerations. Poor husbandry practices could result in reduced feed intake, stress and disease conditions, and consequently affect gut health and performance in <b>weaned</b> <b>piglets.</b> Reduced feed intake is a major risk factor for impaired gut structure and function and therefore a key goal is to maximize feed intake in newly <b>weaned</b> <b>piglets.</b> In <b>weaned</b> <b>piglets,</b> crowding stress could reduce pig performance, favor the proliferation of pathogenic bacteria resulting in diarrhea, stimulate immune responses and interfere with beneficial microbial activities in the gut. Sanitation conditions in the swine barn plays an important role for optimal piglet performance, because unclean conditions reduced growth performance, shifted nutrient requirements to support the immune system and negatively affected the gut morphology in <b>weaned</b> <b>piglets.</b> Appropriate biosecurity measures need to be designed to prevent disease entry and spread within a swine operation, which in turn helps to keep all pigs and piglets healthy. Collectively, husbandry practices relating to feeding and nutrition, animal welfare, biosecurity and disease prevention are important determinants of gut health and piglet performance. Thus, it is suggested that adopting high husbandry practices is a critical piece in strategies aimed at raising pigs without the use of in-feed antibiotics...|$|R
40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to evaluate the effects of purified cellulose, soybean hulls and citrus pulp in the diet of <b>weaned</b> <b>piglets.</b> A total of 72 piglets (36 castrated males and 36 females) weaned at 21 days of age (BW 6. 45 ± 0. 66 kg) was distributed according to a randomized block design, for evaluation of performance, transit time, diarrhea incidence and blood parameters of piglets which received diets containing different sources of fiber. The experimental diets were: control diet - diet composed of corn, soybean meal {{and a source of}} lactose; control + 1. 5 % purified cellulose; control + 3 % soybean hull and control + 9 % citrus pulp. The inclusion of purified cellulose, soybean hulls and citrus pulp in diets of <b>weaned</b> <b>piglets</b> did not affect the performance or transit time of diets in the gastrointestinal tract. However, the use of purified cellulose reduced incidence of diarrhea. The use of purified cellulose, soybean hull and citrus pulp in the diet of <b>weaned</b> <b>piglets</b> does not affect performance or gastrointestinal transit time. The addition of purified cellulose promotes a beneficial effect to control the diarrhea in <b>weaned</b> <b>piglets...</b>|$|R
40|$|A serologic {{survey was}} {{conducted}} among 76 sows randomly selected from a single farrow-to-finish swine herd, located on the Ibiúna municipality, state of São Paulo, Brazil, to investigate associations between Leptospira spp. seropositivity and reproductive performance. For detection of anti-leptospires antibodies, the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) was carried out using live cultures of 22 pathogenic and two saprophytic Leptospira spp. serovars. Questionnaires with open and closed questions were administered to {{the manager of the}} herd for collection of information about the sows included in the study and the reproductive performance of the subsequent offspring. The following variables were evaluated: age of sows, total number of piglets born, number of piglets born alive, number of weak <b>piglets,</b> number of <b>weaned</b> <b>piglets,</b> number of mummified fetuses, number of stillbirths, mass of piglets at birth, mass of <b>piglets</b> at <b>weaning,</b> weaning to service interval (WSI), and occurrence of return to heat, mummified fetuses and stillbirths. The frequency of seropositivity for at least one Leptospira spp. serovar was 18. 4 %. The reactant serovars and respective frequencies were Bratislava (33. 3 %), Hardjobovis (33. 3 %), Shermani (19. 1 %), Icterohaemorrhagiae (9. 5 %) and Grippotyphosa (4. 8 %). Seropositivity for Leptospira spp. was associated with prolonged WSI (P< 0. 001), decreased number of piglets born (P = 0. 001), decreased number of piglets born alive (P< 0. 001), decreased number of <b>weaned</b> <b>piglets</b> (P...|$|R
