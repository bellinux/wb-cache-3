25|$|A {{variety of}} {{indirect}} symptoms characterize Retinitis Pigmentosa {{along with the}} direct effects of the initial rod photoreceptor degeneration and later cone photoreceptor decline. Phenomena such as photophobia, which describes the event in which light is perceived as an intense glare, and <b>photopsia,</b> the presence of blinking or shimmering lights within the visual field, often manifest during the later stages of RP. Findings related to RP have often been characterized in the {{fundus of the eye}} as the Ophthalamic triad. This includes the development of (1) a mottled appearance of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) caused by bone spicule formation, (2) a waxy appearance of the optic nerve, and (3) the attentuation of blood vessels in the retina.|$|E

2500|$|In time, the {{liquefied}} {{vitreous body}} loses support and its framework contracts. This leads to posterior vitreous detachment, {{in which the}} vitreous membrane is released from the sensory retina. During this detachment, the shrinking vitreous can stimulate the retina mechanically, causing the patient to see random flashes across the visual field, {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "flashers", a symptom more formally referred to as <b>photopsia.</b> The ultimate release of the vitreous around the optic nerve head sometimes makes a large floater appear, usually {{in the shape of a}} ring ("Weiss ring"). As a complication, part of the retina might be torn off by the departing vitreous membrane, in a process known as retinal detachment. This will often leak blood into the vitreous, which is seen by the patient as a sudden appearance of numerous small dots, moving across the whole field of vision. Retinal detachment requires immediate medical attention, as it can easily cause blindness. Consequently, both the appearance of flashes and the sudden onset of numerous small floaters should be rapidly investigated by an eye care provider.|$|E

40|$|Background. The authors {{describe}} {{a case of}} recurrent <b>photopsias</b> in a 56 -year-old woman following repeat treatments with systemic intravenous bevacizumab for stage IV ovarian cancer. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} report of <b>photopsias</b> following systemic bevacizumab treatments in a patient with a normal eye exam. Case Presentation. A 56 -year-old Caucasian female complained of onset of floaters and flashes in the temporal peripheral field of the right eye 1 day after receiving intravenous of 30 [*]g of 25 [*]mg/mL of systemic bevacizumab for treatment of stage IV ovarian cancer. Ophthalmic examination, including dilated fundus exam, spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) of the optic nerve head, and enhanced depth imaging SD-OCT of the macula, revealed no significant abnormalities. Possible mechanisms are reviewed. Conclusion. We propose that patients who undergo intravenous bevacizumab treatments are questioned for any ocular symptoms and that more systematic evaluations of retinal nerve fiber layer and choroidal effects are obtained in those patients who are on long-term treatment at high doses...|$|R
30|$|A 34 -year-old Caucasian female {{presented}} with <b>photopsias</b> and blurry vision {{in her left}} eye. Examination, particularly the foveal granularity noted in her affected eye, was archetypal for the diagnosis of MEWDS. Fundus autofluorescence, fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography were also consistent with this diagnosis. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) demonstrated increased retinal pigment epithelium granularity and disruption of the photoreceptor inner segment–outer segment junction subfoveally.|$|R
50|$|<b>Photopsia</b> is the {{presence}} of perceived flashes of light. It is most commonly associated with posterior vitreous detachment, migraine with aura, migraine aura without headache, retinal break or detachment, occipital lobe infarction, and sensory deprivation (ophthalmopathic hallucinations). Vitreous shrinkage or liquefaction, which are the most common causes of <b>photopsia,</b> cause a pull in vitreoretinal attachments, irritating the retina and causing it to discharge electrical impulses. These impulses are interpreted by the brain as 'flashes'.|$|E

50|$|Acute zonal occult outer {{retinopathy}} (AZOOR) is {{an inflammatory}} retinopathy {{in the category}} of white dot syndromes typified by acute loss of one or more zones of outer retinal function associated with <b>photopsia,</b> minimal funduscopic changes and abnormal electroretinography findings.|$|E
50|$|Some {{discrepancy}} {{exists as}} to whether acute zonal occult outer retinopathy (AZOOR) is actually considered a white dot syndrome. However, AZOOR may definitely be related to other diseases included in the white dot syndrome group. AZOOR occurs in young to middle age adults and may eventually progress to retinal cell death. Symptoms include acute visual field loss and <b>photopsias.</b> Suspected causes for AZOOR include autoimmune, viral, and fungal.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Acute zonal occult outer {{retinopathy}} (AZOOR) is a {{rare disease}} characterized by an acute damage {{of one or more}} external retinal zones leading to the visual field or the visual acuity impairment associated with small or no changes in the fundus examination. The main clinical symptoms are scotomas and the sudden onset of <b>photopsias.</b> Abnormal findings on electroretinography and visual field defects are critical for the diagnosis. Central vision is usually preserved and the stabilization occurs in six months in most cases. The objective {{of this article is to}} describe a 24 -month follow-up of a patient with AZOOR and correlate the findings with the typical features of this disease...|$|R
50|$|This {{condition}} {{has also}} {{been identified as a}} common initial symptom of Punctate inner choroiditis (PIC), a rare retinal autoimmune disease believed to be caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking and destroying the retina.

50|$|Vitreous {{hemorrhage}} is the extravasation, or leakage, {{of blood}} into {{the areas in}} and around the vitreous humor of the eye. The vitreous humor is the clear gel that fills the space between the lens and the retina of the eye. A variety of conditions can result in blood leaking into the vitreous humor, which can cause impaired vision, floaters, and <b>photopsia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Symptoms of this {{disorder}} include floaters, blurred vision, <b>photopsia</b> (flashing lights in eyes), loss of color vision and nyctalopia. In an eye examination, light-colored {{spots on the}} retina are seen. Complete loss of visual acuity may happenThe name of the condition comes from the small light-colored fundus spots on the retina, scattered in a pattern like birdshot from a shotgun, but these spots might not be present in early stages.|$|E
40|$|Objective. To {{describe}} {{a case of}} acute zonal occult outer retinopathy (AZOOR) in an active duty patient. Methods. In this paper we studied fundus photographs, optical coherence tomograph, Humphrey visual field 30 - 2, fundus autofluorescence images, fluorescein angiograms, and electroretinography. Results. Exam findings on presentation: a 34 -year-old American Indian female presented with bilateral <b>photopsias,</b> early RPE irregularity, and an early temporal visual field defect. Progression RPE damage and visual field defect along with ERG findings support final diagnosis of AZOOR. Conclusion. AZOOR may initially be identified as a broader category of disease called the “AZOOR complex of disorders”. Specific visual field defects, ERG results, and clinical exam findings will help distinguish AZOOR from other similar disorders...|$|R

Important questions remain in our understanding of BSRC with respect to its pathogenesis, epidemiology, optimal treatment, and prognosis, including the determinants of remission and relapse, as well as the best strategy for monitoring disease activity, progression and response to therapy with electroretinographic and psychophysical testing, established and emerging imaging modalities, and peripheral cytokines profiles...|$|R
50|$|Moore's {{lightning}} streaks are lightning type streaks (<b>photopsia)</b> (seen to {{the temporal}} side) due to sudden {{movement in the}} dark. They are generally caused by shock waves in the vitreous humor hitting the retina. The implication is that the vitreous is softer than normal, generally {{this is not a}} cause for alarm provided they are momentary, occur only in the dark and are due to sudden head movements (acceleration). Professional advice should be sought in cases of doubt, as retinal detachment, a serious condition, also can cause flashes in the eye.|$|E
50|$|The {{onset of}} ocular {{symptoms}} are usually preceded by episode of viral or flu-like {{symptoms such as}} fever, cough or sore throat (however {{this is not always}} the case).

These lesions may be colored from grey-white to cream-shaded yellow.Other symptoms include scotomata and <b>photopsia.</b> In weeks to a month times the lesions begin to clear and disappear (with prednisone) leaving behind areas of retinal pigment epithelial atrophy and diffuse fine pigmentation (scarring). Rarely choroidal neovascularization occur as a late onset complication.|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} sign at {{presentation}} is leukocoria (abnormal white {{reflection of the}} retina). Symptoms typically begin as blurred vision, usually pronounced when one eye is closed (due to the unilateral nature of the disease). Often the unaffected eye will compensate {{for the loss of}} vision in the other eye; however, this results in some loss of depth perception and parallax. Deterioration of sight may begin in either the central or peripheral vision. Deterioration is likely to begin in {{the upper part of the}} vision field as this corresponds with the bottom of the eye where blood usually pools. Flashes of light, known as <b>photopsia,</b> and floaters are common symptoms. Persistent color patterns may also be perceived in the affected eye. Initially, these may be mistaken for psychological hallucinations, but are actually the result of both retinal detachment and foreign fluids mechanically interacting with the photoreceptors located on the retina.|$|E

40|$|Various {{treatment}} modalities {{have been}} described for retinal capillary hemangioma. Our purpose is to present a case of juxtapapillary retinal capillary hemangioma treated with photodynamic therapy. A 69 -year-old woman with no previous ocular history presented with blurred vision and <b>photopsias</b> in the right eye three months ago. At presentation, her best corrected visual acuity was 6 / 9 in the right eye and 6 / 6 in the left eye. The anterior segment was totally normal and IOP was normal in both eyes as well. Dilated fundoscopy revealed a yellowish, well-circumscribed, elevated area with blood vessels, on the inferior margin of the right optic disc, as optic disc edema. Fluorescein angiography and angiogram with indocyanine green confirmed the diagnosis of juxtapapillary retinal capillary hemangioma. The patient was treated with photodynamic therapy with verteporfin and three months later her visual acuity was 6 / 7. 5 in the right eye, while the lesion was slightly smaller. These findings remained stable at the one-year follow-up. In conclusion, photodynamic therapy offers promising anatomical and functional results for juxtapapillary retinal capillary hemangioma, providing visual acuity improvement or even stabilization and restriction of enlargement of the lesion...|$|R
40|$|A {{phenomenon}} {{characterized by}} the experience of seeing light without any light actually entering the eye is called phosphenes or <b>photopsias.</b> Phosphenes can occur spontaneously or via induction by external stimuli. Previous reports regarding phosphenes have primarily focused on externally induced phosphenes such as by applying alternating or direct current to the cortex. A few of these reports used functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) to study activations induced by cortical phosphenes. However, there are no fMRI reports on spontaneous phosphenes originating from the retina and the resulting pattern of cortical activations. We performed fMRI during a reversing checkerboard paradigm in three LCA patients who underwent unilateral gene therapy and reported experiencing frequent phosphene on a daily basis. We observed bilateral cortical activation covering the entire visual cortices when patients reported experiencing phosphenes. In contrast, {{in the absence of}} phosphenes, activation was regulated by patient’s visual ability and demonstrated improved cortical activation due to gene therapy. These fMRI results illustrate the potential impact of phosphene perception on visual function and they may explain some of the variability that clinicians find in visual function testing in retinal degeneration. Although we did not perform correlations between visual function and phosphenes, we hope data presented here raises awareness of this phenomenon and its potential effect on visual function and the implications for clinical testing.

40|$|Melanoma {{of the eye}} is rare, but can mimic a {{range of}} disorders. This report {{highlights}} 2 cases of choroidal melanoma with vision loss mimicking neurological diagnoses. The first patient is a 41 -year-old white male with a known history of multiple sclerosis and a previous episode of optic neuritis in the right eye, who presented with a 6 -month history of decreased vision in the same eye, and occasional <b>photopsiae.</b> He was treated with 2 courses of oral steroids for presumed recurrent optic neuritis. After a temporary improvement in his symptoms, his vision worsened, following which he had a head MRI, which revealed a solid intraocular mass. He was subsequently diagnosed with a choroidal melanoma {{for which he was}} treated successfully with ruthenium- 106 plaque brachytherapy. The second patient is a 57 -year-old female, who presented with a progressive cerebellar syndrome under investigation by the neurology service, as well as decreased vision in the right eye.
