40|$|We {{demonstrated}} a large enhancement of Kerr electro-optic nonlinearity through cascaded <b>Pockels</b> <b>effects</b> in a domain inversion ferroelectric crystal. We designed {{a structure that}} can implement the cascaded <b>Pockels</b> <b>effects</b> and second-harmonic generation simultaneously. The energy coupling between the fundamental lights of different polarizations led to a large nonlinear phase shift, and thus an effective electro-optic nonlinear refractive index. The effective nonlinearity can be either positive or negative, causing the second-harmonic spectra to move towards the coupling center, which in turn, offered us a way to measure the effective electro-optic nonlinear refractive index. The corresponding enhanced Kerr electro-optic nonlinearity is more than three orders of magnitude higher than the intrinsic value. These results open a door to manipulate the nonlinear phase by applying external electric field instead of light intensity in noncentrosymmetric crystals. Comment: 15 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

50|$|The {{electro-optic}} effect relates {{to a change}} in the optical properties of the medium, which is usually a change in the birefringence, and not simply the refractive index.In a Kerr cell, the change in birefringence is proportional to the square of the electric field, and the material is usually a liquid. In a Pockels cell, the change in birefringence varies linearly with the electric field, and the material is a crystal.Non-crystalline, solid electro-optical materials have caught interest because of their low cost of production. These organic, polymer-based materials are also known as organic EO material, plastic EO material, or polymer EO material. They consist of nonlinear optical chromophores in a polymer lattice.

40|$|Both {{the linear}} {{electro-optic}} (<b>Pockel's)</b> <b>effect</b> and electroabsorption (Franz-Keldysh effect) in waveguiding junctions of InGaAsP were measured. The electro-optic coefficient {{is found to}} be 0. 1 - 0. 14 x 10 to the - 12 power m/V at lambda = 1. 54 - 1. 65 micrometers. Possibly this is the first reported measurement of the electro-optic coefficient for InGaAsP. The value found for the electroabsorption is on the order of 7 x 10 to the - 4 power cm to the - 1 power/(V/cm) or approximately 100 cm/ 1 for fields of 200, 000 V/cm at lambda 1. 3 micrometers. All measurements were made on a quaternary film with a bandgap wavelength of 1. 23 micrometers. Because of the rapid commercial introduction of quaternary lasers, LEDs, and detectors to take advantage of large optical fiber bandwidths and low losses in the 1. 2 - to 1. 7 - micrometer region, these measurements are significant in providing some of the basic physical constants needed to design modulators and switches capable of operating at microwave frequencies in this wavelength region...|$|R

40|$|In this manuscript, a {{relatively}} simple and inexpensive INDO/SCI finite-field (FF) method for calculating polarizabilities (R) is demonstrated to give good agreement with results obtained by both the INDO/MRD/ SDCI sum-over-states routine and published results using the RPA method. The FF method is {{as effective as the}} other techniques in predicting both ground and excited state R’s in all substituted and unsubstituted polyenes studied. We observe the correlation described by Marder and co-workers between bond-order-alternation (BOA) and dipolar properties, such as the change in R between the ground and excited states (¢R). In addition, qualitative, but not quantitative, agreement is seen between the calculated ¢R’s of polar polyenes and those measured by Stark-effect spectroscopy. Recent interest in substituted polyenes which exhibit nonlinear optical (NLO) behavior has made accurate calculations of their properties an important predictive tool in materials development.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2006. The {{variable}} {{refractive index}} of electro-optic (EO) materials {{has led to}} a great deal of research interest. Application of an electric field to EO materials leads to a linear variance in refractive index known as <b>Pockel's</b> <b>effect.</b> When incorporated into devices, these materials serve as an effective vehicle for rapid modulation of optical signals using electrical inputs. Nonlinear optical (NLO) chromophores are the most successful family of organic EO materials. These chromophores are typically comprised of a delocalized pi-electron system that connects electron rich moieties (donors) to electron deficient functionalities (acceptors). Hyperpolarizability (beta) is the component of molecular NLO behavior that is responsible for EO effects. Optimization of NLO chromophores for use in EO materials {{has proven to be a}} challenging task because enhancement of beta typically results in reduced stability, decreased transparency to telecommunication wavelengths and other unwanted consequences. A family of NLO chromophores has been synthesized containing novel donor systems based on functionalized guanidines. Some chromophores utilizing these donor systems display larger hyperpolarizabilities than those incorporating conventional donors, yet possess superior transparency and stability properties. The unusual and highly desirable characteristics of these chromophores make them very promising candidates for EO applications...|$|R

Optical modulation is achieved using the plasma dispersion effect due to current injection under forward bias of a p-i-n junction. © 2003 Optical Society of America. OCIS codes: (230. 4110) Modulators; (230. 5750) Resonators. Silicon-on-insulator (SOI) based optoelectronic and photonic devices and circuits are attractive {{due to their}} fabrication compatibility with the CMOS process and possibility of monolithic integration on CMOS chips. Most of the proposed Si electro-optic (E-O) modulators, however, are long and require high drive powers for obtaining a significant modulation depth. Such requirements impose difficulties in integrating these devices on a chip. The main methods to alter the refractive index in Si are the thermo-optic effect and the electro-optic effect. The thermal change of the real optical refractive index in Si is large. However, the thermo-optic effect is rather slow {{and can be used}} only up to I MHz modulation frequencies [1, 2]. For higher modulation frequencies, up to few hundreds of MHz, electro-optic devices are required. Linear electrooptic (<b>Pockel's)</b> <b>effect</b> is absent in bulk, unstrained silicon due to the Si crystal being centrosymmetric [3]. The quadratic electrooptic or the Kerr effect can be used in silicon only under the application of large electric fields [4]. Therefore, the free carrier dispersion effec...|$|R

In this scenario, an unknown electric field results in polarisation rotation of a laser beam propagating through the electro-optic crystal; through inclusion of polarisers to modulate the light intensity incident on a photodiode, a time-resolved electric field measurement can be reconstructed from the obtained voltage trace. As the signals obtained from the crystalline probes are optical, they are inherently resistant to electrical noise pickup, hence {{can be used}} for low-noise field measurement even in areas with high levels of electromagnetic noise {{in the vicinity of the}} probe. Furthermore, as the polarisation rotation due to the <b>Pockels</b> <b>effect</b> scales linearly with electric field, absolute field measurements are obtained, with no need for numerical integration to reconstruct electric fields, as is the case with conventional probes sensitive to the time-derivative of the electric field.|$|E
