It should be noticed that renewable energy supply options can be prioritized (e.g. by transportation or conversion effort, availability over the lifetime of the building or replication potential for future, etc.) and therefore create a hierarchy. It may be argued that resources within the building footprint or on-site should be given priority over off-site supply options.|$|E

Ayr Castle was built in 1197 and the focus of military and judicial control shifted to Ayr resulting in the abandonment of Alloway Mote.|$|E

500|$|The Centuriate Assembly (comitia centuriata or [...] "Army Assembly") of the Roman Republic was {{originally}} the democratic {{assembly of the}} Roman soldiers. The Centuriate Assembly organized the Roman citizens into classes, which were defined by a means test and were economic in nature. The Roman army was divided into units called [...] "Centuries", and these gathered into the Centuriate Assembly for legislative, electoral, and judicial purposes. However, since the number of centuries in each class was fixed, centuries could contain far more than 100 men. Only this assembly could declare war or elect the highest-ranking Roman Magistrates: Consuls, Praetors and Censors. The Centuriate Assembly could also pass a statute that granted constitutional command authority to Consuls and Praetors, and Censorial powers to Censors. In addition, the Centuriate Assembly served as the highest court of appeal in certain judicial cases, and ratified {{the results of the}} Census. While the voters in this assembly wore white undecorated togas and were unarmed, while taking part in the Assembly they were classified as soldiers, and as such they could not meet inside of the <b>physical</b> <b>boundary</b> of the city of Rome. The president of the Centuriate Assembly was usually a Consul (although sometimes a Praetor). Only Consuls (the highest-ranking of all Roman Magistrates) could preside over the Centuriate Assembly during elections because the higher-ranking Consuls were always elected together with the lower-ranking Praetors. Once every five years, after the new Consuls for the year took office, they presided over the Centuriate Assembly as it elected the two Censors.|$|E

2500|$|In 1905 a young, 26-year-old German {{physicist}} (then a Bern patent clerk) named Albert Einstein (1879–1955), {{showed how}} measurements {{of time and}} space are affected by motion between an observer and what is being observed. To say that Einstein's radical theory of relativity revolutionized science is no exaggeration. Although Einstein made many other important contributions to science, the theory of relativity alone represents one of the greatest intellectual achievements of all time. Although the concept of relativity was not introduced by Einstein, his major contribution was the recognition that the speed of light in a vacuum is constant, i.e. the same for all observers, [...] and an absolute <b>physical</b> <b>boundary</b> for motion. This does not impact a person's day-to-day life since most objects travel at speeds much slower than light speed. For objects travelling near light speed, however, the theory of relativity shows that clocks associated with those objects will run more slowly and that the objects shorten in length according to measurements of an observer on Earth. Einstein also derived the famous equation, E = mc2, which expresses the equivalence of mass and energy.|$|E
2500|$|The {{presiding}} magistrate sat on {{a special}} chair (the [...] "curule chair"), wore a purple-bordered toga, and was accompanied by bodyguards called lictors. Each lictor carried the symbol of state power, the fasces, which was a bundle of white birch rods, tied together with a red leather ribbon into a cylinder, and with a blade on the side, projecting from the bundle. While the voters in this assembly wore white undecorated togas and were unarmed, they were still soldiers, and as such they could not meet inside of the <b>physical</b> <b>boundary</b> {{of the city of}} Rome (the pomerium). Because of this, as well as the large size of the assembly (as many as 373 centuries), the assembly often met on the Field of Mars (Latin: Campus Martius), which was a large field located right outside of the city wall. The president of the Centuriate Assembly was usually a Consul (although sometimes a Praetor). Only Consuls (the highest-ranking of all Roman Magistrates) could preside over the Centuriate Assembly during elections because the higher-ranking Consuls were always elected together with the lower-ranking Praetors. Consuls and Praetors were usually elected in July, and took office in January. Two Consuls, and at least six Praetors, were elected each year for an annual term that began in January and ended in December. In contrast, two Censors were elected every five years. Once every five years, after the new Consuls for the year took office, they presided over the Centuriate Assembly as it elected the two Censors.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{official}} <b>physical</b> <b>boundary</b> between the United States and Mexico was set, Mexicans {{that lived in}} territory now belonging to the U.S. faced {{a new kind of}} border. This border was much more than simply a line dividing two nations. Although the geographic boundary was permanently set to the south of them, these new Mexican Americans were still seen as foreigners and outcasts in their new country. [...] The rhetoric of dominance used by Euro-Americans prevented Mexican Americans from feeling like true American citizens. [...] The steadfast public opinion of white superiority prevented Mexican Americans from being treated as equals. [...] This racial difference is what caused a new type of border to form between the two groups. [...] This racial border unfairly discriminated against Mexican Americans even though they had the same status as citizens of the United States. [...] Due to the rhetoric of dominance utilized by whites, Mexican Americans were given a much lower social and economic status that they could not overcome. [...] It also caused many Mexican Americans to question their cultural identity. [...] As the border shifted and they became U.S. residents, the culture shifted around them, too. [...] Some homes that used to be on Mexican territory were now on American soil and were surrounded by a new, unfamiliar culture. [...] The decision each individual had to make was whether to embrace their new citizenship and assimilate into American society or hold tight to their culture and continue to self-identify as Mexican. [...] By way of the rhetoric of dominance, Mexican Americans faced new social, economic, and identity crises in the United States.|$|E

2500|$|Both {{popular and}} {{professional}} research articles in cosmology often {{use the term}} [...] "universe" [...] to mean [...] "observable universe". This can be justified {{on the grounds that}} we can never know anything by direct experimentation about any part of the Universe that is causally disconnected from the Earth, although many credible theories require a total universe much larger than the observable universe. No evidence exists to suggest that the boundary of the observable universe constitutes a boundary on the Universe as a whole, nor do any of the mainstream cosmological models propose that the Universe has any <b>physical</b> <b>boundary</b> in the first place, though some models propose it could be finite but unbounded, like a higher-dimensional analogue of the 2D surface of a sphere that is finite in area but has no edge. It is plausible that the galaxies within our observable universe represent only a minuscule fraction of the galaxies in the Universe. According to the theory of cosmic inflation initially introduced by its founder, Alan Guth (and by D. Kazanas [...] ), if it is assumed that inflation began about 10−37 seconds after the Big Bang, then with the plausible assumption that the size of the Universe before the inflation occurred was approximately equal to the speed of light times its age, that would suggest that at present the entire universe's size is at least 3x1023 times the radius of the observable universe. [...] There are also lower estimates claiming that the entire universe is in excess of 250 times larger than the observable universe and also higher estimates implying that the universe is at least 101010122 times larger than the observable universe.|$|E
