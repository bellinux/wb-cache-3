To capitalize on this investment, the success of these promotional activities is crucial. The effectiveness of casino promotions has been scarcely examined within research.

50|$|The stadium, though, had two advantages. First, before {{installation}} of the wrap-around scoreboard and billboards, the predominant gusty winds from the south knocked down many fly balls that {{would otherwise have been}} home runs. Second, the large number of metal bleacher seats would come in handy on Bat Night, the <b>promotional</b> <b>game</b> where children age 13 and under would receive (in most years) a real bat that could be pounded on the bleachers. As Bat Night would (in some years) be the only sell-out for the usually poor Rangers squads, the spectacle of 10,000-15,000 kids banging their bats all at once would create a deafening sound.|$|E

5000|$|Hotline Miami was {{a spiritual}} {{successor}} to an unreleased game called Super Carnage. Jonatan Söderström {{started working on}} the game when he was 18, describing it as a top-down shoot-em-up in which {{the aim was to}} kill as many people as possible. The project was cancelled following difficulties programming the game's artificial intelligence's (AI) pathfinding. Söderström later met Dennis Wedin, singer and keyboard player in the metalcore band Fucking Werewolf Asso. They collaborated on a <b>promotional</b> <b>game</b> for the band called Life/Death/Island, which was again cancelled. Söderström and Wedin decided that their next game would be a commercial release, due to financial difficulties. They saw Super Carnage and its potential as a game. They decided to expand upon this, and thus they started developing Hotline Miami. Immediately after being shown the prototype of Super Carnage, Dennis Wedin was excited to start working on the game. When asked in an interview about his initial thoughts on being shown Söderström's prototype, Wedin stated [...] "I loved it right from the start! I played his prototype for quite a while (even though it was just one level) and that was the most exciting part, making a game that we loved to play ourselves. We never really thought about what anyone else would think, we just wanted to play it and to do that we had to make it".|$|E
