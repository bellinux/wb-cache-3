5|$|Because {{glass is}} very brittle in its solid state, {{it is often}} <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> <b>cracking</b> upon heating and cooling, {{especially}} if the heating and cooling are uneven. This is because the brittleness of glass {{does not allow for}} uneven thermal expansion. Glass that has been welded will usually need to be cooled very slowly and evenly through the glass transition, in a process called annealing, to relieve any internal stresses created by a temperature gradient.|$|E
5|$|Shallow penetration, another {{detriment}} to weld strength, can {{be addressed}} by decreasing welding speed, increasing the current or using a smaller electrode. Any of these weld-strength-related defects can make the weld <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> <b>cracking,</b> but other factors are involved as well. High carbon, alloy or sulfur content in the base material can lead to cracking, especially if low-hydrogen electrodes and preheating are not employed. Furthermore, the workpieces should not be excessively restrained, as this introduces residual stresses into the weld and can cause cracking as the weld cools and contracts.|$|E

40|$|Exterior stains {{for wood}} protect the wood surface from sun-light and moisture. Because stains are {{formulated}} {{to penetrate the}} wood surface, they are not <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> or peel as can film-forming finishes, such as paints. This publication describes the properties of stains and wood, methods for applying stains, and the expected service life of stains...|$|R
25|$|In most lugged steel frames, the lugs have {{a simple}} pointed shape. The lug's curves {{maximize}} {{the strength of the}} joint, while minimizing the possibility of stress risers, which would otherwise make the frame <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> <b>cracking</b> {{at the end of the}} lug.|$|E
25|$|Other design flaws {{centred on}} a {{requirement}} for a strip-down and inspection at six-monthly intervals, this took three weeks per weapon using AWRE civilian staff. The unstable nature of the bomb required that the work be done in-situ at RAF facilities, causing considerable disruption to operational duties. There were three main reasons for the strip-down and these were deterioration of the rubber bag, corrosion of the steel balls, and deterioration of the HE, which was <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> <b>cracking.</b> Replacement of a weapon's HE would cost the RAF in excess of £90,000 adjusted to 2006 prices.|$|E
25|$|Bismuth {{significantly}} {{lowers the}} melting point and improves wettability. In presence of sufficient lead and tin, bismuth forms crystals of Sn16Pb32Bi52 with melting point of only 95°C, which diffuses {{along the grain}} boundaries and may cause a joint failure at relatively low temperatures. A high-power part pre-tinned with an alloy of lead can therefore desolder under load when soldered with a bismuth-containing solder. Such joints are also <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> <b>cracking.</b> Alloys with more than 47% Bi expand upon cooling, which {{may be used to}} offset thermal expansion mismatch stresses. Retards growth of tin whiskers. Relatively expensive, limited availability.|$|E

50|$|The engines {{suffered}} {{from a number of}} defects and were <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> <b>cracked</b> frames. As their condition deteriorated and with the introduction of modern engines and later DEL for heavy traffic, the engines were relegated to lesser duties and most were withdrawn during the 1950s. Three engines that had been written off the books were returned to service for short periods in the late 1950s to overcome motive power shortages at that time.|$|R
2500|$|Small {{changes were}} made to the {{cylinder}} head for the 1995 model year. In 1996, the engine block was redesigned for greater strength. The new block had more webbing and a stud girdle for added rigidity of the crankshaft main bearings. Engines installed in 1999 Grand Cherokees carried the [...] "PowerTech" [...] name that had been used intermittently in prior years and on other Chrysler truck and SUV engines. The name was subsequently passed on to 4.0s in the other Jeep models that used the engine, the Cherokee and Wrangler. The cylinder head was again changed for the 2000 model year to a more emissions-friendly design. This head was designated as [...] "0331" [...] in the casting number. Early 0331 heads are <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> <b>cracking,</b> causing coolant to contaminate the oil, which can lead to catastrophic engine failure. The head cracks in the center between #3 and #4 cylinders. The crack is usually discernible with the valve cover removed as a [...] "milky" [...] tan line. This condition is usually discovered before catastrophic engine failure, but can lead there if not corrected in a timely manner. The casting was fixed in mid to late 2001, but the same casting number was retained. The [...] "fixed" [...] heads have [...] "TUPY" [...] cast in the center where the cracks used to occur. Also new for the 2000 model year, was the distributorless, coil on plug ignition system. Option code: ERH.|$|E

50|$|Turkey oak {{is widely}} planted and is naturalised {{in much of}} Europe. This is partly for its {{relatively}} fast growth. It is used as an ornamental, and as a coastal windbreak. The wood has many {{of the characteristics of}} other oaks, but is very <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> and split and hence is relegated to such uses as fencing. Several cultivars have been selected, including 'Variegata', a variegated cultivar, and 'Woden', with large, deeply lobed leaves.|$|R

50|$|Several {{institutions}} have established archives to preserve photographic plates and prevent their valuable historical information from being lost.

25|$|Cold cured or cold pour dentures, {{also known}} as {{temporary}} dentures, do not look very natural, are not very durable, tend to be highly porous and are only used as a temporary expedient until a more permanent solution is found. These types of dentures are inferior and tend to cost much less due to their quick production time (usually minutes) and low cost materials. It is not suggested that a patient wear a cold cured denture {{for a long period}} of time, for they are <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> <b>cracks</b> and can break rather easily.|$|R

In this research the effects of fatigue damage are assessed for two aluminium alloys, 2024 -T 3 and 7150 -T 561, after using a surface engineering method which uses the plastic deformation on the surface, like many others, to extend (or reduce) the fatigue life of materials.

50|$|To dry {{bone and}} ivory it {{requires}} a series of alcohol baths. Bone is a material <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> <b>cracks</b> and splits during the dehydration process. If the bone has been established as weak and unstable, and that dehydration can cause <b>cracks</b> and splits <b>to</b> the bone structure, the bone is impregnated prior drying {{with the use of}} 50% solution of polyvinyl acetate (PVA(C4H6O2)n) in distilled water. For ivory it is sometimes necessary to go through longer dehydration baths to insure that the surface of the treated material does not elaminate or crack.|$|R
50|$|It is not recommendable {{to replace}} more than around 20% of the lime content with cement. Cement-based render is very stiff and <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> or detach {{from the wall}} when {{subjected}} to stress induced by expansion due to solar radiation and moisture. It is also less permeable to moisture and water vapour. Water entering through fine cracks in the surface does not easily diffuse and can penetrate into the softer stone, thus causing the deterioration which harling aims to prevent. For similar reasons modern, barrier paints {{should not be used}} in place of traditional lime washes.|$|R
