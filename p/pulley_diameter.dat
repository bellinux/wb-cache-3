50|$|The grab {{has to be}} {{selected}} so that the combined weight of grab and contents does not exceed the grabbing safe working load of the crane. The mass of the contents depends upon {{the properties of the}} product being handled; its density, flow characteristics, angle of repose, lump/grain size, purity (e.g. is it wet or dry) and, in some cases, degree of settlement (e.g. a ship's cargo has compacted due to vibration, rolling, pitching and yawing over a long voyage). Most bulk-handling cranes are dedicated to a single product, but others will handle various materials and need a selection of grabs. Some applications (e.g. manganese ore) may also require the use of teeth fitted to the grab jaws to enable penetration. Other applications (e.g. rape seed) may require to be self-sealing and have offset lower jaws with serrated, angle cut side cutters to restrain easy-flow properties.When off-loading a ship, the grab may be more efficient if designed with a low-profile extended body which enables reaching under the ship's hatches, negating any need to centre the product with human and machinery access.The grab mechanism may be four rope, double rope, single rope ring discharge, single rope self-dumping, double chain, single chain self-dumping, single chain ring discharge, hydraulic or electro-hydraulic.Rope grabs have rope pulleys in both the upper and lower girders and close by drawing the closing rope(s) to shorten the gap between the two girders. The minimum diameter of the pulley is restricted by the ratio of the <b>pulley</b> <b>diameter</b> to the rope diameter, the strands of the wire rope being subjected to fatigue bending stresses if the pulley is too small, giving premature failure. The physical size of the pulleys then determines the size of the girders, then determining a break point between a four rope and a two rope design. The closing force at the shell jaws, and, inversely, the speed of closure, are determined by the number of pulleys on each closing rope in the two girders. The closing rope is fed into the grab mechanism through either a bellmouth or an arrangement of small rollers. The weight of the grab is supported by the holding rope(s) and pinned to the upper girder allowing some angular freedom. Holding and closing ropes require separate winding drums in the crane.The mechanism on chain grabs operates {{in the same way as}} on rope grabs. The chains are connected to ropes on the crane by (e.g. bordeaux) couplings which allow rotation. A linked chain requires a much small diameter pulley than the equivalent rope which makes a smaller, more compact, design of girder. Chains used on chain pulleys are less easily inspected for wear and fatigue than ropes which show outer strand deformation well before failure. Failure of a rope or chain is a very high severity (dangerous) hazard.|$|E

40|$|From {{transportation}} of bulk materials in underground and open-cut mines to applications in power stations and processing plants to name but a few, belt conveyors {{are widely used}} as an economical continuous conveying method. Most of these industries rely strongly on conveyor transfers to divert material from one conveyor to another {{at some point in}} their system. The unfortunate reality is that some companies will be driven by cost minimisation for the short-term rather than planning for the long-term. This will result in bad decisions being made and the incorrect conveyor transfer being installed with flow-on effects such as downtime for modifications or even replacement. There are many facets to the design of a successful transfer chute including minimising product impact, degradation, chute wear, noise, dust and spillage while maximising the material velocity to allow the product to leave the chute at or near the speed of the receiving conveyor. Fully understanding the behaviour of a material is paramount to designing a successful transfer chute. Accurately determining the material discharge and trajectory from the head pulley is the first step in this design process. This paper will focus on the determination of the material trajectory as it leaves the belt conveyor head pulley.

The processing operation at Mowana is a standard flotation plant designed to produce copper concentrates from oxide, supergene, and sulphide ores. The expected average output of 16. 2 tons per hour of copper concentrates has never been attained since plant commissioning. The major bottleneck has been established to be located around the crushing circuit of the Mowana production chain. The major hypotheses of this research are that performance in a crushing plant is adversely influenced by moderate and discrete changes in the process. The ultimate objective {{is to develop a}} dynamic process simulator, administered in Simulink/MATLAB® background, for application in the design of a control model utilising two crusher variables and a self-tuning control algorithm. In this research work, a process model describing the dynamic operation of an Osborn 57 S gyrasphere cone crusher is investigated. Modelling of the Mowana crushing circuit is carried out by combining the steady-state and dynamic components of the crushing equipment in the Simulink/Matlab® environment. Eccentric speed (ES) and closed-side setting (CSS) are amongst the important inputs to the models. The rest of the inputs (crusher power, crusher cavity level, federate, <b>pulley</b> <b>diameters,</b> liner wear measurement, number of teeth of the pinion and bevel gear) are extracted from the data collected across the Mowana mine crushing circuit. While it has been demonstrated that the crusher CSS is the most influential controllable parameter, it has also been demonstrated that crusher capacity and power can be used effectively to optimise the circuit. The use of crushing power and cavity level control is suitable for the crushing circuit since the crushers are running on a constant ES and the CSS is set and reset manually. The outcome of the study presents an insight into the optimization of the Mowana mine crushing circuit through the design of a self-tuning controller for the cone crusher and for prototyping, parameters of a PID controller were determined in the Simulink/MATLAB® environment.

40|$|The V-belt {{drive is}} a rather popular, widely used form of power {{transmission}} in agricultural and food industry engineering. At the same time, its stability, the lifetime of V-belt is influenced by several environmental factors, namely in the food industry by the contamination affecting the belt sides, the ambient temperature, humidity and the occasionally aggressive (acidic, alkaline air, air saturated with gases, etc.) medium. In the case of agricultural machinery, the vibration caused by uncertainly oriented pulleys with bearing in different plate structures (often being shaken in the fields) as well as alignment adjustment inaccuracies jeopardize {{the reliability of the}} parameters of the drive. Furthermore, the efficiency is determined by several factors together: the slippage occurring during drive transmission, the hysteresis loss resulting from the external and internal friction occurring with the belt entering and exiting the pulley. Experimental equipment and calculation methods were developed to determine the dynamics of temperature increase generated by the belt and pulley relationship. The temperature generated in the V-belt was measured as a function of pretension, <b>pulley</b> <b>diameter</b> and bending frequency. The so-called damping factor characterizing the contact with the pulley (the external friction when entering and exiting the groove) and the hysteresis loss (inner friction) are also determined. On the basis of the damping factor (ζ ≈ 400 Ns/m 2) of the V-belt involved in the experiments the other losses (P oth) occurring from the pulley—V-belt contact and internal friction may be estimated. The drive parameters may be optimized with the mathematical model describing the effect of the <b>pulley</b> <b>diameter</b> and belt frequency on the increase in temperature. A standardized calculation method as well as design factors valid for the properly adjusted drive and normal operating conditions determined through empirical and laboratory experiments are used for the sizing of V-belt drives. The lifetime of V-belt drives designed in this way, used in extreme conditions typical of agricultural machinery will not be appropriate and will not provide clear, predictable information for maintenance planning. In such cases the results of our own many lifetime tests conducted in the given circumstances can be safely relied on. The agricultural harvesting machines are large plate-body self-propelled structures on which most of the power supply of the (threshing, cleaning, moving, etc.) machine units handling the crop is realized via belt drives. The distance and angular displacement of the axes involved in the drive can vary within wide limits. The misalignment and angular displacement of the pulleys can be the result of installation instability — due to the plate structure — and the deformation of the plate structure occurring during the operation as well. V-belt drives operate satisfactorily under such conditions as well, however these faults are unfavourable in terms of belt lifetime and result in the reduction of drive efficiency. A further aim of our research is to examine through experiments the lifetime and efficiency of V-belts used in agricultural machines as a function of drive adjustment errors. According to the results of the measurements of the geometrical adjustment errors of V-belt drives performed in the field, the pulleys of agricultural equipment are not always positioned in the medium plane of the drive. In our experiments these data served as independent variables. Figure 1 shows the arrangement of a V-belt drive in a grain harvester with the laser pulley alignment measuring instrument installed as an accessory. In the case of many machine types in 80 % of the tested drives three times the permissible error was measured, and because of off-road use, due to dynamic load these errors further increased {{as a result of the}} frame deformation. The results of both the belt bending testing and the geometrical adjustment testing of the drive offer great help in the design of belt drives.

The operational parameters studied are the driver pulley angular velocity and the driven pulley opposing torque (load). A high-fidelity flexible multibody dynamics parametric model of a two-pulley belt-drive system was created using a commercial multibody dynamics code. In the model the belt’s rubber matrix is represented using three-dimensional brick elements and the belt’s reinforcements are represented using one dimensional beam elements at the top surface of the belt. An asperity-based Coulomb friction model is used for the friction forces between the pulley and belt. The pulleys are modeled as rigid bodies with a cylindrical contact surface. The equations of motion are integrated using an explicit solution procedure. Unlike prior models which use one-dimensional truss or beam elements for the belt, the present model uses a three-dimensional belt model which introduces the effect of the thickness of the belt rubber matrix (modeled using brick elements). This enables a more accurate prediction of the belt stresses and slip than prior models. This thesis resolves in more details the complex stick-slip friction behavior of an axially flexible belt coupled with the shear effects of a flexible rubber cushion {{and at the same time}} shows the effect of the main system parameters on this stick-slip behavior. Some of the important conclusions of the thesis include: (1) the driver pulley has two distinct contact zones - a negative traction zone and a positive traction zone - while only one traction zone is present over the driven pulley; (2) the width of the negative traction zone on the driver pulley increases with the belt-pulley coefficient of friction and decreases with the belt axial stiffness; (3) the maximum belt tension and normal contact stress occur on the driver pulley and increase with the belt thickness, belt axial stiffness, and coefficient of friction; (4) belt-drive energy efficiency increases with the belt axial stiffness, and decreases with belt thickness, belt bending damping, belt operating speed, and operating torque load. The belt-drive modeling methodology presented in this thesis which enables accurate prediction of the belt stresses and slip can in turn be used to more accurately predict the fatigue life, wear life, and energy efficiency of belt-drives...|$|R

The belt stresses include: belt rubber shear, normal, axial and lateral stresses; reinforcements tension force; and tangential and normal belt-pulley contact stresses. Belt slip is measured using the driven over driver pulleys 2 ̆ 7 angular velocity ratio. Each parameter was varied over a range to understand its impact on the steady-state belt-drive response. The material parameters studied are belt axial stiffness and damping, belt bending stiffness and damping, and belt-pulley friction coefficient.

50|$|One of {{the unique}} {{features}} of the Shopsmith is its method of speed control. Rather than multiple pairs of pulleys or an electronic speed control, the Mark V uses a Reeves-type continuously variable transmission consisting of two variable <b>diameter</b> <b>pulleys</b> controlled by a dial and worm gear. (Standard on the Mark V, this system was optionally available on the early 10ER machines.) Not only does this give theoretically infinite speed variation between the maximum and minimum speeds, it is also simple enough to be serviced fairly easily by a hobbyist. The new (as of 2010) Shopsmith Mark 7 uses a computer-controlled motor that offers more power, greater speed range, reversibility and easy conversion to 220 V.An injury suffered by the user of a Shopsmith gave the Supreme Court of California the opportunity to create the modern rule of strict liability for defective products in 1963.|$|R
