40|$|The {{assembly}} of the BDYE detector requires the attachment of sixteen silicon (Si) processor dice (eight on the top side; eight on the bottom side) onto a low-temperature, co-fired ceramic (LTCC) substrate using 63 Sn- 37 Pb (wt. %, Sn-Pb) in a double-reflow soldering process (nitrogen). There are 132 solder joints per die. The bond pads were gold-platinum-palladium (71 Au- 26 Pt- 3 Pd, wt. %) thick film layers fired onto the LTCC in a post-process sequence. The <b>pull</b> <b>strength</b> and failure modes provided the quality metrics for the Sn-Pb solder joints. <b>Pull</b> <b>strengths</b> were measured in both the as-fabricated condition and after exposure to thermal cycling (- 55 / 125 C; 15 min hold times; 20 cycles). Extremely low <b>pull</b> <b>strengths</b> [...] {{referred to as the}} low <b>pull</b> <b>strength</b> phenomenon [...] were observed intermittently throughout the product build, resulting in added program costs, schedule delays, and a long-term reliability concern for the detector. There was no statistically significant correlation between the low <b>pull</b> <b>strength</b> phenomenon and (1) the LTCC 'sub-floor' lot; (2) grit blasting the LTCC surfaces prior to the post-process steps; (3) the post-process parameters; (4) the conductor pad height (thickness); (5) the dice soldering assembly sequence; or (5) the dice pull test sequence. Formation of an intermetallic compound (IMC) /LTCC interface caused by thick film consumption during either the soldering process or by solid-state IMC formation was not directly responsible for the low-strength phenomenon. Metallographic cross sections of solder joints from dice that exhibited the low <b>pull</b> <b>strength</b> behavior, revealed the presence of a reaction layer resulting from an interaction between Sn from the molten Sn-Pb and the glassy phase at the TKN/LTCC interface. The thick film porosity did not contribute, explicitly, to the occurrence of reaction layer. Rather, the process of printing the very thin conductor pads was too sensitive to minor thixotropic changes to ink, which resulted in inconsistent proportions of metal and glassy phase particles present during the subsequent firing process. The consequences were subtle, intermittent changes to the thick film microstructure that gave rise to the reaction layer and, thus, the low <b>pull</b> <b>strength</b> phenomenon.

Wide ranges of wire bond force, bond power, and bond-pad temperature were used to identify {{the combination of these}} processing parameters that can produce good wire bonds, allowing the construction of process windows. The criterion for successful bonds is no peel off for all 20 wires tested.

The bondability of immersion bond pads was comparable to electrolytic bond pads with a similar Au thickness.

40|$|An {{appropriate}} {{additional load}} of driving wheels {{is very important}} for an efficient use of engine output. This additional load influences significantly the driving momentum and, thus, the pulling efficiency of the tractor. This pulling force is dependent on adhesion forces influencing the driving wheels and {{it can be said that}} the higher this adhesion force (i. e. the higher additional load), the higher the adhesion force and the higher the engine output. In this paper the authors present results of measurements of the pulling characteristics on a roller dynamometer. The measurements were performed in two variants, viz.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effect of bonding {{frequency}} on bondability of Au wire on a PCB bond pad. The wire bonding was performed at two different frequencies, 62 kHz and 138 kHz, and at varying bond pad temperatures between 60 and 110 degrees C. It is shown that the bond strengths of the wires bonded at a high frequency were generally higher than those bonded at a low frequency for all temperatures studied. Two distinct wire failure modes were observed for the wires bonded at the high frequency: the wires with high <b>pull</b> <b>strengths</b> failed at the bond neck, while those with low <b>pull</b> <b>strengths</b> failed mainly within the bonded wire body. This resulted in a large <b>pull</b> <b>strength</b> data scatter, which was explained by the high Q factor of the high frequency transducer. The bondability obtained for the high bond power end was much higher for the high frequency, giving rise to a wider process window in terms of bond power for the high frequency bonding. The wire bonding performance was compared between the "open" and "closed" loop bonding systems. The minimum bond powers required for successful bonds in the closed loop system were significantly lower than those required in the open loop system (e. g. 20 - 40 mW vs. 110 - 135 mW at 90 degrees C). The closed loop system was able to correct the resonance frequency shift, thus maintaining an almost constant bond power during bonding. In the open loop system, in contrast, a high bond power needs to be continuously supplied because of the power drop. This causes an excessive energy to be transmitted to the bonded wire, resulting in weakened wire due to excessive deformation. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007...|$|R

No clear benefit for one intervention was observed for horizontal jump performance. Potentially beneficial effects were observed for the hip thrust compared with the front squat in 10 - and 20 -m sprint times. The hip thrust was likely superior for improving normalized isometric midthigh <b>pull</b> <b>strength</b> and very likely superior for improving hip thrust 3 RM and isometric midthigh <b>pull</b> <b>strength.</b> These results support the force vector theory...|$|R
40|$|The ageing {{characteristics}} of aluminium wire bonds on five different thick film gold inks were investigated. The assessment criteria selected were the <b>pull</b> <b>strength</b> and the electrical {{resistance of the}} bonds. A correlation between these does not exist. Under stress the bond strength first declines sharply, however, afterwards stabilizes {{at a level that}} can just be accepted. The electrical resistance of the bond, in contrast, rises slowly, but then reaches values, at which the contact is no longer guaranteed. Internal oxidation is proposed as a new explanation for this behaviour...|$|R
40|$|This paper reports {{comparative}} {{performance of}} wire bondability of electrolytically plated Au/Ni/Cu bond pads on rigid FR- 4 and bismaleimide trazine (BT) PCBs, {{as well as}} flexible polyimide (PI) substrate. The metallization surfaces were treated with plasma to study the effect of bond pad surface cleanliness on wire bondability. Process windows were constructed {{as a function of}} bonding temperature and bond power for the individual substrate materials. Significant improvements of wire <b>pull</b> <b>strength</b> and process window were noted after plasma treatment with a substantial reduction in minimum bonding temperature from 120 degrees C to 60 degrees C for both the rigid and flexible substrates. The minimum bond power required to produce successful bonds decreased with increasing bonding temperature. At a bonding temperature of 120 degrees C, the process window for the flexible substrate was wider than the rigid substrates. The wire bondability and wire <b>pull</b> <b>strength</b> of rigid substrates decreased with increasing bonding temperature above 120 degrees C due to softening of the substrate which adversely affected the effective bond force and the transmission of ultrasonic energy. In contrast, the wirebonding performance of the flexible substrate remained stable at 120 degrees C or above because the thermo-mechanical properties of flexible PI substrate were rather insensitive to temperature. The process windows of flexible substrates with and without stiffener showed similar bondability. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2006...|$|R
