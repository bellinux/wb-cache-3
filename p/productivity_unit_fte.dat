This prompted Adi Husada Undaan Wetan (RSAH UW) Hospital whichusing Indonesian Ministry of Health (MOH) 2005, considering FTE to determine the number of nurses in the inpatient unit. On the use of FTE, RSAH UW Hospital meetsseveral obstacles, and objectives of this research is to reveal the obstacles on the FTE method and determine the compatible method for RSAH UW Hospital. Methods: The method used in this research is calculate the number of nurses using FTE method, then do a comparison with number of nurses that were determined by MOH 2005 method.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the thermal {{performance of a}} membrane distillation (MD) solar desalination unit located at the Mechanical Engineering Department site, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt. The unit is designed and installed {{as a part of}} a partially funded European Commission (EC) project named "PV and thermally-driven small-scale, stand-alone desalination system with very low maintenance needs (SMADES) ". The basic innovative MD principle and module is highlighted. The Alexandria MD unit is described and the unit performance is presented for the 6 months of its operation period. The unit performance covers the transient changes in the <b>unit</b> <b>productivity,</b> <b>unit</b> feed water, brine and product water temperatures and conductivities, unit salt rejection, solar collector and MD process efficiencies.

For a sunny day of, say, 7. 25 kWh/d the results indicate that the unit produces about 11. 21 /d for every m(2) of the collector area. The relatively high productivity, above that of the conventional solar still, is due to the partial recovery of the condensation energy.

However, the acceptance of this {{technology in}} Malaysia is relatively low with few projects being constructed with pre-cast components. The objectives of this paper are to measure labor productivity in construction, to examine productivity indicators between pre-cast and conventional Cast-In-Situ (CIS) methods, and to explore areas of improvements to promote adoption of pre-cast technology in Malaysia. Data on construction labor productivity are collected using questionnaires, interviews, and observations at the construction sites. Based on statistical analysis performed in this paper, it is concluded that pre-cast method is better than conventional CIS method in terms of construction labor productivity, time to complete a project, variability of construction activities, and loss of efficiency during the construction process.

40|$|Abstract Our {{assessment}} of the competitiveness of the Hong Kong economy from various perspectives indicates that the overall competitiveness of Hong Kong economy has been improving {{during the past several}} years. However, from a longer term historical perspective, there are still a number of areas in which Hong Kong's competitiveness has been eroded relative to her main competitors in East Asia, especially in export sector. On the aggregate level, although Hong Kong's total factor productivity (TFP) growth rate is amongst the best performers in East Asia in the recent years, it has been adversely affected by the continuing relocation of Hong Kong's manufacturing production to the Mainland China. On sectorial levels, Hong Kong's competitiveness deteriorated in several important categories of goods and service exports. Overall, our study shows that the Hong Kong economy still maintains its resilience to outside shocks, nevertheless it needs to explore new areas to fuel its future growth.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} two {{apparent}} puzzles for the Italian economy: i) How can an extremely {{poor performance in}} productivity growth be compatible with strong employment growth?; and ii) How can {{a sharp decline in}} competitiveness come along with higher export prices and a general situation for exporters that looks far from desperate? Some possible explanations to these puzzles are presented in this paper. Special factors such as regularisation of immigrant workers and the entry of low-skilled workers into the labour market may have contributed to depressing measured productivity and overstating the loss in competitiveness. Against the backdrop of Italy?s structural problems, this paper asks whether the Italian economy can adjust and grow. Medium-term prospects for the Italian economy remain challenging: for instance, growth in total factor productivity is still disappointingly low and competitiveness keeps deteriorating. However, there have been encouraging signs of improvement, notably the labour market has performed well {{over the past few years}} and in response to pressures from fierce foreign competition some adjustment appears to have taken place in the exposed sectors. <b>Productivity,</b> <b>Unit</b> Labour Costs, Competitiveness...|$|R
