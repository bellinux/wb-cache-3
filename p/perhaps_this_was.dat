25|$|Like Tik-Tok, Scarecrow {{contains}} a significant romantic element—the Rose Princess and Private Files in the former, and Gloria and Pon in the latter—that was not {{typical of the}} earlier Oz books. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> {{a factor in the}} books' limited reception. In adapting his children's stories for stage and film versions, Baum had to compromise between appealing to children and to adults. His films suffered with audiences because of this conflict in audience expectation. Perhaps this confusion affected the sales of the books as well, to some degree.|$|E
25|$|Yet {{given the}} factions and jealousies {{that arise in}} any court and that Hephaestion was supremely close to the {{greatest}} monarch the western world had yet seen, it is remarkable how little enmity he inspired. Arrian mentions a quarrel with Alexander's secretary Eumenes but, because of a missing page in the text, {{the greater part of}} the detail is missing, leaving only the conclusion that something persuaded Hephaestion, though against his will, to make up the quarrel. However, Plutarch, who wrote about Eumenes in his series of Parallel Lives, mentions that it was about lodgings and a flute-player, so <b>perhaps</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> an instance of some deeper antagonism breaking out into a quarrel over a triviality. What that antagonism might have been, {{it is not possible to}} know, but someone with the closeness to the king of a secretary might well have felt some jealousy for Hephaestion's even greater closeness.|$|E

25|$|Daepyeong {{became a}} large central {{settlement}} in the Early Middle Mumun (c. 850-700 BC). The focus of the settlement was a large nucleated group of 144 pit-houses in Eoeun. Another nucleated settlement of 115 pit-houses developed in Okbang {{at about the same}} time. Archaeological evidence from the Middle Mumun indicates that prominent individuals in Eoeun and Okbang probably competed for dominance in the local area. For example, greenstone production and distribution began in Eoeun and was traded to Okbang and areas outside of Daepyeong. Many ditches and ditch-enclosures appeared in Eoeun and Okbang beginning in the Early Middle Mumun. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> due to conflict between Okbang and Eoeun, or the whole of Daepyeong with distant outside settlements. Eventually, 8 substantial ditch-and-palisades were constructed at Okbang. Interestingly, this sub-period sees a pattern in which greenstone artifacts that are made in Eoeun are consumed by those who are buried in the ditch-and-palisade precinct of Okbang.|$|E
500|$|During Mondale's 1967 {{questioning}} {{about what}} was to become known as the [...] "Phillips Report", Seamans was afraid Mondale might actually have seen a hard copy of Phillips' presentation, and responded that contractors have occasionally been subjected to on-site progress reviews; <b>perhaps</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> what Mondale's information referred to. Mondale continued to refer to [...] "the Report" [...] despite Phillips' refusal to characterize it as such, and angered by what he perceived as Webb's deception and concealment of important program problems from Congress, he questioned NASA's selection of North American as prime contractor. Seamans later wrote that Webb roundly chastised him in the cab ride leaving the hearing, for volunteering information which led to the disclosure of Phillips' memo.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Screen Rant, Alex Leadbeater felt, {{regardless}} of the short's connections to Logan and Deadpool 2, it [...] "ultimately is a good slice of Deadpool fun." [...] Leadbeater also praised the alternate online release, as pirated versions of the theatrical showings had already appeared online and the extra scenes in the official online version were incentive for fans to watch the official release over the illegal ones. Trent Moore of Blastr called the short [...] "a fun little scene", and said that Leitch [...] "certainly {{seems to have a}} solid grasp of the irreverent tone that makes the character work so well." [...] Jacob Hall at /Film said the short was a [...] "fun little surprise" [...] and compared it to Marvel Studios' Marvel One-Shots. He added that there is [...] "not much to judge quite yet, but [...] does showcase a strong eye for comedy" [...] in the footage, and particularly noted the [...] "ridiculously depressing and dilapidated" [...] setting. Corey Chichizola of CinemaBlend said the short is [...] "certainly cool enough to the wet the palate for any X-Men fans", and particularly noted the [...] "strong blue tint, which is in stark juxtaposition to the very bright and yellow world of Deadpool. With a new director stepping behind the camera, <b>perhaps</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a choice that we'll see in" [...] Deadpool 2.|$|E

2500|$|Gardiner uses as {{evidence}} {{the length of}} Titanics sea trials. Olympics trials in 1910 took two days, including several high speed runs, but Titanics trials reportedly only lasted for one day, with (Gardiner alleges) no working over half-speed. Gardiner says this was because the patched-up hull could not take any long periods of high speed. [...] <b>Perhaps</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> {{due to the fact}} that Titanic as a nearly identical twin sister of the Olympic was expected to handle exactly the same, or perhaps the Board of Trade inspectors were in on the scheme.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the advent}} of the stereo LP coinciding with the growing {{popularity}} of the complete ballet, many other complete recordings of it have been made. Notable conductors who have done so include Maurice Abravanel, André Previn, Michael Tilson Thomas, Mariss Jansons, Seiji Ozawa, Richard Bonynge, Semyon Bychkov, Alexander Vedernikov, [...] Ondrej Lenard, Mikhail Pletnev, and most recently, Simon Rattle. A CD of excerpts from the Tilson Thomas version had as its album cover art a painting of Mikhail Baryshnikov in his Nutcracker costume; <b>perhaps</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> {{due to the fact that}} the Tilson Thomas recording was released by CBS Masterworks, and CBS had first telecast the Baryshnikov [...] "Nutcracker".|$|E
2500|$|Apadana's {{relief is}} also {{unique in that}} it delineates the {{presence}} {{and power of the}} king. Known as [...] "Treasure reliefs" [...] the depicted scenes on Apadana stress the continuity of the kingdom through Darius the Great, and stress his presence throughout the empire, as well as depict his army of Persian immortals. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> Darius's attempt to create a symbol of the assured continuity of his line. Apadana hall and the adjacent structures in the complex are believed to have been designed to host large number of people. In fact, halls of Persepolis could at any one time host some ten thousand visitors easily with the king and the royal staff seated appropriately.|$|E

Madhubala married Kishore Kumar in 1960 [...] and according to Leena Chandavarkar (Kishore's fourth wife): [...] "When she realized Dilip was not going to marry her, on the rebound and just to prove to him that she could get whomsoever she wanted, she went and married a man she did not even know properly." [...] B. K. Karanjia assumed that [...] "Madhubala may have felt that <b>perhaps</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> her best chance" [...] because by this time she became seriously ill, and was about to stop working completely; however, he added that [...] "it was a most unlikely union, and not a happy one either." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the 1949 accident, Hogan {{never truly}} {{captured}} {{the hearts of}} his galleries, despite {{being one of the}} best golfers of his time. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> due to his perceived cold and aloof on-course persona. But when Hogan shocked and amazed the golf world by returning to tournament golf only 11 months after his accident, and took second place in the 1950 Los Angeles Open after a playoff loss to Sam Snead, he was cheered on by ecstatic fans. [...] "His legs simply were not strong enough to carry his heart any longer", famed sportswriter Grantland Rice said of Hogan's near-miss. However, he proved to his critics (and to himself, especially) that he could still win by completing his famous comeback five months later, defeating Lloyd Mangrum and George Fazio in an 18-hole playoff at Merion Golf Club to win his second U.S. Open Championship.|$|E
2500|$|In 1611 the {{historian}} John Speed asserted Shakespeare's links with Catholicism, {{accusing him of}} satirising in Henry IV the Lollard (or proto-Protestant) martyr John Oldcastle (first portrayed by Shakespeare under his character's real name, then the alias John Falstaff after complaints from Oldcastle's descendants) and linking the playwright with Jesuit Robert Persons, describing them together as [...] "the Papist and his poet". Modern critics have attributed other motives for Shakespeare's portrayal; the story of Oldcastle was a popular one and telling the tale from the [...] "Papist" [...] perspective (while acknowledging that <b>perhaps</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a perspective with which Shakespeare already had some affinity) was an effective and familiar way {{to bring it to}} his audience. A direct explanation, however, comes from the facts of the story in the contemporary accounts of the period; Prince Henry had left his dear friend Oldcastle to his fate after he had failed to persuade the stubborn old knight to recant when he was imprisoned for lollardry.|$|E

2500|$|We can {{see from}} this {{evidence}} that Grianán of Aileach was an extremely important site. It was the secular centre of Northwest Donegal while the ecclesiastical settlement at Derry was the religious centre. Together, they acted as the political hub of the region. Aileach's political and strategic importance was such that the annals report that it was attacked {{at least three times}} during its existence. In 674, Fínsnechta Fledach, King of Ireland, destroyed the fort. <b>Perhaps,</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the earlier hillfort that stood on the site before the cashel was built. In 937, during the reign of Muirchertach mac Néill, Viking raiders demolished the site. [...] Vikings had settled at Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle during this period. In 1006, Brian Boru, marched though the territory of the Cenel Conail and the Cenel Eogain and probably came to Aileach. [...] In 1101, another king of Munster, Muirchertach Ua Briain, came to Inishowen where he proceeded to plunder and ravage the region. He destroyed the Grianán of Aileach in revenge for the destruction and demolition of Kincora by Domnall Ua Lochlainn in 1088.|$|E
2500|$|Hitchens {{became a}} US citizen in 2007. Hitchens {{did not leave}} his {{position}} writing for The Nation until after the September 11 attacks, stating that he felt the magazine had arrived at a position [...] "that John Ashcroft is a greater menace than Osama bin Laden." [...] The September 11 attacks [...] "exhilarated" [...] him, bringing into focus [...] "a battle between everything I love and everything I hate" [...] and strengthening his embrace of an interventionist foreign policy that challenged [...] "fascism with an Islamic face." [...] His numerous editorials {{in support of the}} Iraq War caused some to label him a neoconservative, although Hitchens insisted he was not [...] "a conservative of any kind," [...] and his friend Ian McEwan described him as representing the anti-totalitarian left. Hitchens recalls in his memoir having been [...] "invited by Bernard-Henri Levy to write an essay on political reconsiderations for his magazine La Regle du Jeu. I gave it the partly ironic title: 'Can One Be a Neoconservative?' Impatient with this, some copy editor put it on the cover as 'How I Became a Neoconservative.' <b>Perhaps</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> an instance of the Cartesian principle as opposed to the English empiricist one: It was decided that I evidently was what I apparently only thought." [...] Indeed, in a 2010 BBC interview, he stated that he [...] "still [...] like a Marxist" [...] and considered himself [...] "a leftist." ...|$|E
2500|$|George D. Stevens, {{a former}} {{executive}} at Hartford City’s Fort Wayne Corrugated Paper Company, shocked the city after his death. [...] Stevens moved to Hartford City in 1911. [...] He was a quiet, distinguished-looking, widower that lived alone at the Hotel Hartford. [...] He had natural mechanical skills, and rose to an executive engineering position at the city's Fort Wayne Corrugated paper mill. [...] Stevens {{became one of the}} wealthiest men in town, and was chauffeured to and from work. [...] He received a patent in 1931, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a hint of additional sources of income that helped him accumulate his wealth. [...] Stevens was known as a philanthropist within the community, and also started the Akron Foundation in his original home town of Akron, Ohio. [...] He became one of Hartford City's leading citizens, and joined the town’s Rotary Club, Elks Lodge, and Masonic Lodge. [...] His quiet social life often involved simply sitting {{in the lobby of the}} Hotel Hartford, and chatting with those that approached him. [...] He died in Hartford City of chronic myocarditis at the age of 80 on April 8, 1940. [...] His death was front page news in the local newspapers, and the paper mill shut down for a half day. [...] Some of the citizens of Hartford City attended Stevens’ funeral 260 miles away in Akron – and were surprised to learn that Stevens was a black man that had been living as a white man in an all-white town. [...] Given the Ku Klux Klan activities in Hartford City during the 1920s (all other blacks left town during that time), perhaps Stevens felt his masquerade was necessary. [...] Black or white, Hartford City was fortunate to have George Stevens as a member of the community.|$|E
