30|$|In this study, {{we develop}} {{a model in}} which a <b>publicly</b> <b>owned</b> {{platform}} competes with a private one in a free-to-air broadcasting industry in which programmes are differentiated in two dimensions: content (horizontal differentiation) and quality (vertical differentiation). In this context, we consider the <b>publicly</b> <b>owned</b> firm’s optimal level of advertising and identify {{the conditions under which}} the recently adopted policy of an “advertising-free” <b>publicly</b> <b>owned</b> platform is actually an optimal choice from the social welfare perspective.|$|R
50|$|Public {{utilities}} can be privately <b>owned</b> or <b>publicly</b> <b>owned.</b> <b>Publicly</b> <b>owned</b> utilities include {{cooperative and}} municipal utilities. Municipal utilities may actually include territories outside of city limits {{or may not}} even serve the entire city. Cooperative utilities are owned by the customers they serve. They are usually found in rural areas. <b>Publicly</b> <b>owned</b> utilities are non-profit. Private utilities, also called investor-owned utilities, are owned by investors, and operate for profit, {{often referred to as}} a rate of return.|$|R
2500|$|Historically, <b>publicly</b> <b>owned</b> parcels were {{exempt from}} paying {{assessments}} on real property. [...] The courts construed an implied exemption for special assessments under {{the provision of}} the California Constitution exempting local governments from property taxation. [...] The practical effect of the historical exemption was to require private property owners, in addition to paying an assessment share attributable to their own parcel, to also pay the share of assessments {{that would otherwise be}} attributable to <b>publicly</b> <b>owned</b> parcels. [...] In assessment districts containing a large number of <b>publicly</b> <b>owned</b> parcels, requiring private property owners to also pay the share attributable to <b>publicly</b> <b>owned</b> parcels significantly increased the amount of the assessment private property owners had to pay.|$|R
30|$|In this study, we {{consider}} the role of programme quality and a <b>publicly</b> <b>owned</b> platform {{in the context of}} the free-to-air broadcasting industry. <b>Publicly</b> <b>owned</b> platforms are prominent in the broadcasting media industry in many Western countries. The empirical relevance of this presence is observed in Bel and Domènech (2009) (table 1 p. 167), and more recently, in Sanz (2012). In particular, we note the existence of one or more national <b>publicly</b> <b>owned</b> TV platforms in Italy, Germany, France, UK, Switzerland and Spain.|$|R

50|$|The {{streambed}} of Hog Run is <b>publicly</b> <b>owned.</b> It is one {{of twenty}} streams in the Upper Susquehanna-Lackawanna drainage basin whose streambed is public property.

40|$|The {{continued}} {{coexistence of}} small, <b>publicly</b> <b>owned</b> electricity utilities and larger privately owned utilities suggests that each ownership form has advantages inherent in scale and/or {{the acquisition of}} inputs. This pattern {{may be due to}} voters being better monitors in small jurisdictions, which yields more effective municipal cost control. This empirical study analyzes, using a translog cost function, the relative cost-efficiency of a relatively large sample of 121 privately <b>owned</b> and 61 <b>publicly</b> <b>owned</b> firms generating electricity via fossil fuels. <b>Publicly</b> <b>owned</b> firms are indeed more efficient at low output levels. Ownership choices are consistent with cost minimization. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{controversy}} after announcing {{an urban}} land {{policy has been}} found regularly. Most of them involved the diversity of needs and conflict directions of utilization. The problems of controversies in <b>publicly</b> <b>owned</b> land utilization is usually related to ‘black box’ 2 policy, in-efficient decision-making, poor land management, poor co-ordination, ignorance of public land actors, politic, and market involvement (economic factors). The study focused on Thailand cases in these following issues; • The recent decision-making process in <b>publicly</b> <b>own</b> land. • Ad-hoc policy in public organizations and decision-making without the participation of all involved actors. • <b>Publicly</b> <b>owned</b> lands and potential alternatives of utilization. • Involved actors and their attitudes toward land utilization policies.

50|$|In the United States, {{public sector}} {{real estate is}} the {{collection}} of <b>publicly</b> <b>owned,</b> <b>publicly</b> managed and publicly leased real property assets.

30|$|We also analyse {{the social}} {{profitability}} {{of the presence}} of a <b>publicly</b> <b>owned</b> platform and show that the optimal government intervention in the broadcasting industry has a crucial dependence on the interactions between the quality differential of platforms and the relationship between the social value of advertising and nuisance cost. In particular, we find that the existence of a <b>publicly</b> <b>owned</b> platform can be a social optimum even if it provides lower quality than the private platform. However, we also identify conditions under which a private duopoly is socially better than a mixed duopoly even if the <b>publicly</b> <b>owned</b> platform provides higher quality than its private competitor.|$|R
