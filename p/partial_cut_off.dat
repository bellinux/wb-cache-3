40|$|Abstract This note {{addresses}} the undirected multiflow (multicommodity flow) theory. A multiflow {{in a network}} with terminal set T {{can be regarded as}} a single commodity (A, T) -flow for any nonempty proper subset A ⊂ T by ignoring flows not connecting A and T A. A set system A on T is said to be lockable if for every network having T as terminal set there exists a multiflow being simultaneously a maximum (A, T) -flow for every A ∈ A. The multiflow locking theorem, due to Karzanov and Lomonosov, says that A is lockable if and only if it is 3 -cross-free. A multiflow can also be regarded as a single commodity (A,B) -flow for every <b>partial</b> <b>cut</b> (A,B) of terminals, where a <b>partial</b> <b>cut</b> is a pair of disjoint subsets (not necessarily a bipartition). Based on this observation, we study the locking property for <b>partial</b> <b>cuts,</b> and prove an analogous characterization for a lockable family of <b>partial</b> <b>cuts...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractPartial cutting {{has been}} {{proposed}} {{as a means to}} better conserve biodiversity in managed forest landscapes. However, partial cutting encompasses many forms of silviculture; some with implicit goals of maintaining biodiversity such as multicohort harvesting or others which may specifically focus on regeneration of stands but may still provide some additional benefits for biodiversity such as shelterwood harvesting. Here we compared ground beetle assemblages of clear cuts, shelterwoods, multicohort harvested stands and uncut stands collected using pitfall traps both 2 and 3 -years post-harvest. We hypothesized that partial cutting treatments would maintain assemblages that were more similar to uncut stands than to clear cuts. We further hypothesized that among <b>partial</b> <b>cuts</b> the multicohort harvested stands, with relatively high levels of retention (66 %), would maintain beetle assemblages that were more similar to uncut stands than would shelterwoods, which had lower levels of retention (50 %). We collected 6692 individuals, representing 42 species. Catch rates of beetles were similar among all harvested treatments (shelterwood, multicohort and clear cuts) and lower than uncut stands. Species richness and composition was similar between shelterwood and multicohort stands. Both <b>partial</b> <b>cut</b> treatments fell between clear cuts and uncut stands in terms of species richness and compositional similarity. Compositional differences between uncut stands and <b>partial</b> <b>cut</b> stands were defined primarily by reduced abundances of forest associated species such as Agonum retractum (LeConte), Synuchus impunctatus (Say) and four Pterostichus species within <b>partial</b> <b>cuts.</b> Within <b>partial</b> <b>cuts,</b> beetle assemblages differed between machine corridors with 0 % retention and adjacent <b>partial</b> <b>cut</b> strips (50 % retention) and uncut vegetation corridors (100 %). We conclude that both shelterwoods and multicohort harvesting stands provide at least initially similar benefits for biodiversity compared to clear cutting although neither maintains assemblages consistent with those found in uncut stands. We expect that these similarities will end once trees are removed from shelterwoods. The reductions in abundances within <b>partial</b> <b>cuts</b> may extend the time necessary for individual populations to increase to pre-harvest levels in <b>partial</b> <b>cuts.</b> For land-managers, similar initial responses of beetle assemblages in multicohort and shelterwood harvests may permit some flexibility for conservation planning whereby final removal of seed trees within shelterwoods could be delayed depending on the status of recovering beetle populations...|$|R

In {{order to determine the}} effects of disruption of irrigation in different growth stages of autumn’s rapeseed cultivars, an experiment was conducted in 2009 - 2010 at Isfahan agriculture research station. A split plot layout within a randomized complete block design 3 replications was used. Main plots were seven levels of <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> irrigation namely, D 1 = current irrigation or irrigation after 80 millimeter vaporize from class A basin to physiological maturity, D 2 = <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> irrigation from stem elongation phase and then on, D 3 = <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> the irrigation from flowering and then on, D 4 = <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> the irrigation from pod formation phase and then on, D 5 = <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> the irrigation in stem and flowering phase, D 6 = <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> the irrigation in stem and pod phase, D 7 = <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> the irrigation in flower and pod formation, and sub plots were two rapeseed cultivars, namely, Zarfam and Okapi. With increasing the number of irrigation, rapeseed yield will increase, but if the water lacks occurred, it is better not to <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> irrigation in flower and stem phase, in order to get acceptable seed and oil yield.
