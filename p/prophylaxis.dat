5|$|Many {{governments and}} {{research}} institutions participate in HIV/AIDS research. This research includes behavioral health interventions, such as research into sex education, and drug development, such as research into microbicides for sexually transmitted diseases, HIV vaccines, and antiretroviral drugs. Other medical research areas include {{the topics of}} pre-exposure <b>prophylaxis,</b> post-exposure <b>prophylaxis,</b> circumcision and HIV, and accelerated aging effects.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, the American College of Physicians (ACP) {{issued a}} {{clinical}} practice guideline making three strong recommendations based on moderate-quality evidence: that hospitalized patients be assessed for {{their risk of}} thromboembolism and bleeding before <b>prophylaxis</b> is started; that heparin or a related drug be used if potential benefits are thought to outweigh potential harms; and that graduated compression stockings not be used. The ACP also drew attention {{to a lack of}} support for any performance measures encouraging physicians to apply universal <b>prophylaxis</b> without regard to the risks.|$|E
5|$|A {{course of}} antiretrovirals {{administered}} within 48 to 72hours after exposure to HIV-positive blood or genital secretions {{is referred to}} as post-exposure <b>prophylaxis</b> (PEP). The use of the single agent zidovudine reduces the risk of a HIV infection five-fold following a needle-stick injury. As of 2013, the prevention regimen recommended in the United States consists of three medications—tenofovir, emtricitabine and raltegravir—as this may reduce the risk further.|$|E
5|$|During childhood, malaria causes anemia {{during a}} period of rapid brain development, and also direct brain damage {{resulting}} from cerebral malaria. Some survivors of cerebral malaria have an increased risk of neurological and cognitive deficits, behavioural disorders, and epilepsy. Malaria <b>prophylaxis</b> was shown to improve cognitive function and school performance in clinical trials when compared to placebo groups.|$|E
5|$|In {{compound}} implants (two stage implants), {{between the}} actual implant and the superstructure (abutment) are gaps and cavities into which bacteria can penetrate from the oral cavity. Later these bacteria will return into the adjacent tissue {{and can cause}} periimplantitis. As <b>prophylaxis</b> these implant interior spaces should be sealed.|$|E
5|$|Warfarin {{is used to}} {{decrease}} the tendency for thrombosis or as secondary <b>prophylaxis</b> (prevention of further episodes) in those individuals who have already formed a blood clot (thrombus). Warfarin treatment can help prevent formation of future blood clots and help {{reduce the risk of}} embolism (migration of a thrombus to a spot where it blocks blood supply to a vital organ).|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, the Common Cold Unit {{was set up}} by the Medical Research Council in 1946 and it {{was where}} the {{rhinovirus}} was discovered in 1956. In the 1970s, the CCU demonstrated that treatment with interferon during the incubation phase of rhinovirus infection protects somewhat against the disease, but no practical treatment could be developed. The unit was closed in 1989, two years after it completed research of zinc gluconate lozenges in the <b>prophylaxis</b> and treatment of rhinovirus colds, the only successful treatment {{in the history of the}} unit.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of drugs that can help prevent or {{interrupt}} malaria in travelers to places where infection is common. Many of these drugs are also used in treatment. Chloroquine may be used where chloroquine-resistant parasites are not common. In places where Plasmodium is resistant to one or more medications, three medications—mefloquine (Lariam), doxycycline (available generically), or the combination of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride (Malarone)—are frequently used when <b>prophylaxis</b> is needed. Doxycycline and the atovaquone plus proguanil combination are the best tolerated; mefloquine is associated with death, suicide, and neurological and psychiatric symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Those {{with either}} {{definite}} pulmonary AVMs or an abnormal contrast echocardiogram with no clearly visible lesions are {{deemed to be}} at risk from brain emboli. They are therefore counselled to avoid scuba diving, during which small air bubbles may form in the bloodsteam that may migrate to the brain and cause stroke. Similarly, antimicrobial <b>prophylaxis</b> is advised during procedures in which bacteria may enter the bloodstream, such as dental work, and avoidance of air bubbles during intravenous therapy.|$|E
5|$|Antiretroviral {{treatment}} {{among people}} with HIV whose CD4 count ≤ 550 cells/µL is a very effective way to prevent HIV infection of their partner (a strategy known as treatment as prevention, or TASP). TASP {{is associated with a}} 10 to 20 fold reduction in transmission risk. Pre-exposure <b>prophylaxis</b> (PrEP) with a daily dose of the medications tenofovir, with or without emtricitabine, is effective in a number of groups including {{men who have sex with}} men, couples where one is HIV positive, and young heterosexuals in Africa. It may also be effective in intravenous drug users with a study finding a decrease in risk of 0.7 to 0.4 per 100personyears.|$|E
5|$|Fairley's {{proposed}} use of atebrin as a prophylactic {{agent was}} accepted and Fairley switched the Australian Army over to using atebrin as a <b>prophylaxis</b> instead of quinine in March 1943. The most acute problem {{at this time}} was a shortage of atebrin. The Australian Army had only seven weeks' stock was on hand in March 1943 and US forces in both the South West Pacific and South Pacific Area were drawing on Australian Army stocks as they had not yet received adequate stocks of their own. The drug is also a dye, and had the known side effect of making the skin and eyeballs of the user go yellow in colour after repeated use but this was an acceptable drawback in wartime. Prolonged use could cause lichen planus and psychosis in rare cases, but atebrin still {{turned out to be}} much safer than quinine. Blackwater fever—which had a mortality rate of 25%—disappeared entirely.|$|E
5|$|Programs {{to prevent}} the {{vertical}} transmission of HIV (from mothers to children) can reduce rates of transmission by 92–99%. This primarily {{involves the use of}} a combination of antiviral medications during pregnancy and after birth in the infant and potentially includes bottle feeding rather than breastfeeding. If replacement feeding is acceptable, feasible, affordable, sustainable, and safe, mothers should avoid breastfeeding their infants; however exclusive breastfeeding is recommended during the first months of life if this is not the case. If exclusive breastfeeding is carried out, the provision of extended antiretroviral <b>prophylaxis</b> to the infant decreases the risk of transmission. In 2015, Cuba became the first country in the world to eradicate mother-to-child transmission of HIV.|$|E
25|$|CNS <b>prophylaxis</b> (preventive therapy) to {{stop the}} cancer from {{spreading}} to the brain and nervous system in high-risk patients. Standard <b>prophylaxis</b> may include radiation of the head and/or drugs delivered directly into the spine.|$|E
25|$|Tetanus <b>prophylaxis</b> may be appropriate.|$|E
25|$|With {{improved}} {{treatments and}} better <b>prophylaxis</b> against opportunistic infections, death rates have significantly declined.|$|E
25|$|TB <b>prophylaxis</b> {{for those}} with {{positive}} tuberculin skin test or IGRA blood test.|$|E
25|$|In immunocompromised patients, <b>prophylaxis</b> with co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole), atovaquone, {{or regular}} {{pentamidine}} inhalations {{may help prevent}} PCP.|$|E
25|$|A {{surgical}} {{approach is}} necessary in cases where a breakthrough infection results despite <b>prophylaxis,</b> or there is non-compliance with the <b>prophylaxis.</b> Similarly if the VUR is severe (Grade IV & V), there are pyelonephritic changes or congenital abnormalities. Other reasons necessitating surgical intervention are failure of renal growth, formation of new scars, renal deterioration and VUR in girls approaching puberty.|$|E
25|$|Surgical {{and dental}} {{procedures}} - Antibiotic <b>prophylaxis</b> {{may be required}} before certain surgical or dental procedures.|$|E
25|$|Cimetidine {{has also}} been {{reported}} to be effective for acute porphyric crisis and possibly effective for long-term <b>prophylaxis.</b>|$|E
25|$|After adding {{any risk}} factors together, {{a total of}} one point or less {{indicates}} no preventive action is needed. A total of two points indicates short-term <b>prophylaxis,</b> e.g. with LMWH, {{may be used in}} temporary risk factors, as well as administering prophylactic treatment seven days postpartum, starting a couple of hours after birth. A total of 3 points increases the necessary duration of post partum <b>prophylaxis</b> to six weeks.|$|E
25|$|For {{patients}} with vWD scheduled for surgery and cases of vWD disease complicated by clinically significant hemorrhage, human-derived medium purity factor VIII concentrates, which also contain von Willebrand factors, {{are available for}} <b>prophylaxis</b> and treatment. Humate P, Alphanate, Wilate and Koate HP are commercially available for <b>prophylaxis</b> and treatment of vWD. Monoclonally purified factor VIII concentrates and recombinant factor VIII concentrates contain insignificant quantity of vWF, so are not clinically useful.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} immunoglobulins are the immunoglubulins currently {{approved for}} use for infectious disease <b>prophylaxis</b> and immunotherapy, in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Cats - Dental <b>prophylaxis</b> as {{described}} above for the dog and treatment and extraction of teeth with feline odontoclastic resorptive lesions (FORLs).|$|E
25|$|Current uses {{include the}} {{treatment}} of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) and <b>prophylaxis</b> against UTIs in people prone to recurrent UTIs.|$|E
25|$|As of 2007, the American Heart Association {{no longer}} {{recommends}} antibiotics for endocarditis <b>prophylaxis</b> before certain procedures {{in patients with}} aortic insufficiency. Antibiotic <b>prophylaxis</b> to prevent endocarditis before gastrointestinal or genitourinary procedures is no longer recommended for any patient with valvular disease. Cardiac stress test is useful in identifying individuals that may be best suited for surgical intervention. Radionuclide angiography is recommended and useful when the systolic wall stress is calculated and combined to the results.|$|E
25|$|Probiotic <b>prophylaxis</b> {{may prevent}} {{colonization}} and delay onset of Pseudomonas infection in an ICU setting. Immunoprophylaxis against Pseudomonas is being investigated.|$|E
25|$|Supplementation of CoQ10 {{has been}} found to have a {{beneficial}} effect on the condition of some sufferers of migraine. An explanation for this is the theory that migraines are a mitochondrial disorder, and riboflavin: the mitochondrial connection |journal=Headache |volume=52 |issue=Suppl. 2 |pages=81–87 |date=Oct 2012 |pmid=23030537 |doi=10.1111/j.1526-4610.2012.02233.x |type=Review}} and that mitochondrial dysfunction can be improved with CoQ10. The Canadian Headache Society guideline for migraine <b>prophylaxis</b> recommends, based on low-quality evidence, that 300mg of CoQ10 be offered as a choice for <b>prophylaxis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Unfractionated heparin, low {{molecular}} weight heparin, warfarin (not to be used during pregnancy) and aspirin remain the basis of antithrombotic treatment and <b>prophylaxis</b> both before and during pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|In {{the event}} of a {{radioiodine}} release the ingestion of <b>prophylaxis</b> potassium iodide, if available, or even iodate, would rightly take precedence over perchlorate administration, and would be the first line of defence in protecting the population from a radioiodine release. However, in {{the event of}} a radioiodine release too massive and widespread to be controlled by the limited stock of iodide and iodate <b>prophylaxis</b> drugs, then the addition of perchlorate ions to the water supply, or distribution of perchlorate tablets would serve as a cheap, efficacious, second line of defense against carcinogenic radioiodine bioaccumulation.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{increased}} risk of infection, physicians administer oral antibiotics as a <b>prophylaxis</b> after a surgical splenectomy (or starting at birth, for congenital asplenia or functional asplenia).|$|E
25|$|Antibiotics were {{historically}} commonly {{recommended to}} prevent IE {{in those with}} heart problems undergoing dental procedures (known as dental antibiotic <b>prophylaxis).</b> They are less commonly recommended for this procedure.|$|E
25|$|Artemisinins are {{not used}} for malaria <b>prophylaxis</b> (prevention) because of the {{extremely}} short activity (half-life) of the drug. To be effective, {{it would have to}} be administered multiple times each day.|$|E
25|$|A {{risk score}} of four points or higher means <b>prophylaxis</b> in the ante partum period is needed, {{as well as}} at least six weeks post partum. A {{previous}} distal DVT indicates a minimum of 12 weeks (three months) of therapeutic anticoagulation therapy. A previous proximal DVT or pulmonary embolism requires a minimum of 26 weeks (6.5 months) of therapy If the therapy duration reaches delivery time, the remaining duration may be given after delivery, possibly extending the minimum of six weeks of post partum therapy. In a very high risk, high-dose ante partum <b>prophylaxis</b> should be continued at least 12 weeks after delivery.|$|E
25|$|Proof of concept {{trials have}} {{indicated}} that Ebola-targeted siRNAs may be effective as post-exposure <b>prophylaxis</b> in humans, with 100% of non-human primates surviving a lethal dose of Zaire Ebolavirus, the most lethal strain.|$|E
25|$|Although minocycline's broader {{spectrum}} of activity, {{compared with other}} members of the group, includes activity against Neisseria meningitidis, its use as a <b>prophylaxis</b> is no longer recommended because of side effects (dizziness and vertigo).|$|E
