40|$|Abstract — Wind power {{represents}} {{one of the most promising}} sources of renewable energy, and improvements to wind turbine design and control can have a significant impact on energy sustainability. Although wind energy has not been a canonical research area in robotics, we argue here that many robotics techniques (<b>physical</b> <b>system</b> <b>design,</b> modeling and control, and policy learning techniques) can in fact have a large impact on wind energy research. Pursuing this goal, in this paper we develop a small, fully functional robotic wind turbine, capable of variable speed operation and individual pitch actuation. We analyze the power output of the turbine under different operating conditions, comparing to predictions from aerodynamic simulators. Using inverse dynamics control we demonstrate high-frequency blade pitch control synchronized to rotor angle. Finally, using a novel Reinforcement Learning policy search algorithm, we show that the system can quickly optimize its energy output in an online and fully model-free manner. I...|$|E

40|$|A {{methodology}} is developed, {{which combines}} a top-down design procedure for manufacturing systems with a decomposition of manufacturing system requirements. Traditional design procedures for manufacturing system design guide {{the design process}} from {{the analysis of the}} product to be produced through detailed design of the system to operational execution planning. While such design procedures provide the designer with a structured top-down approach, it does not enable the designer to recognize how design decisions at various stages affect the overall system requirements. The decomposition of manufacturing system requirements applies axiomatic design. It relates system objectives to design solutions and enables the connection of design decisions such as equipment selection and operator work loop design with higher-level system objectives such as improvement of quality, reduction of throughput time, and cost control.

40|$|Modifying {{the design}} of an {{existing}} system {{to meet the needs}} of a new task is a common activity in mechatronic system devel-opment. Often engineers seek to meet requirements for the new task via control design changes alone, but in many cases new requirements are impossible to meet using control design only; <b>physical</b> <b>system</b> <b>design</b> modifications must be considered. Plant-Limited Co-Design (PLCD) is a design methodology for meet-ing new requirements at minimum cost through limited physi-cal system (plant) design changes in concert with control sys-tem redesign. The most influential plant changes are identified to narrow the set of candidate plant changes. PLCD provides quantitative evidence to support strategic plant design modifica-tion decisions, including tradeoff analyses of redesign cost and requirement violation. In this article {{the design of}} a counterbal-anced robotic manipulator is used to illustrate successful PLCD application. A baseline system design is obtained that exploits synergy between manipulator passive dynamics and control to minimize energy consumption for a specific pick-and-place task. The baseline design cannot meet requirements for a second pick-and-place task through control design changes alone. A limited set of plant design changes is identified using sensitivity analy-sis, and the PLCD result meets the new requirements at a cost significantly less than complete system redesign. ...|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{methods for}} {{mechatronics}} design are {{often based on}} a sequential approach, where the mechanical structure is designed first, and then fitted with off-the-shelf electric motors, drive electronics, gearheads and sensors. Finally a control system is designed and optimized for the already existing physical system. Such a design method, that doesn’t consider aspects from a control point of view during {{the design of the}} physical system, is unlikely to result in a system with optimal control performance. Furthermore, to separately design and optimize each of the physical components will, from a global perspective, generally not result in a system that is optimal from a weight, size or cost perspective. In order to reach the optimal design of an integrated mechatronic system (mechatronic module) it is necessary to treat the system as a whole, considering aspects from all involved engineering domains concurrently. In this thesis such an approach to integrated design of mechatronic servo systems is presented. A design methodology that considers the simultaneous design of the electric machine, gearhead, machine driver and control system, and therefore enables global optimization, has been developed. The target of the design methodology is conceptual design and evaluation. It is assumed that the load to be driven by the servo system is known and well defined, a load profile describing the wanted load motion and the corresponding torque, is required as input. The methodology can then be used to derive the lightest or smallest possible system that can drive the specified load. Furthermore, the control performance is evaluated and optimized, such that the <b>physical</b> <b>system</b> <b>design</b> and the controller design are integrated. The methodology is based on modelling and simulation. Two types of component models have been developed, static and dynamic models. The static models describe relations between the parameters of the physical components, for example a component’s torque rating as function of its size. The static models are based on traditional design rules and are used to optimize the physical parts of the system. The dynamic models describe the behaviour of the components and are used for control system design and performance optimization. The gear ratio is identified to be the most central design variable when designing and optimizing electromechanical servo systems. The gear ratio directly affects the required size of the gearhead, electric machine and the machine driver. But it has also large influences on the system’s control performance. It is concluded that high gear ratios generally are better from a control point of view than low ratios. A consequence of this is that it is possible, without compromising the control performance, to use less expensive (less accurate) sensors and microprocessors in high gear ratio servo systems, while low gear ratio systems require more expensive hardware. It is also concluded that it is essential to include all performance limiting phenomena, linear as well as non-linear, in this type of integrated analysis. Using for example a linearized system description for controller design, means that many of the most important couplings between control system and <b>physical</b> <b>system</b> <b>design</b> are overlooked.

In many cases, the tone at the fan blade passing frequency {{is characterized by a}} frequency above the first mode cut on frequency of the exhaust stack and both its amplitude and the frequency are time varying. The variation in amplitude is a result of turbulence and temperature variations in the duct which cause angular variations in the nodal plane of modes with diametrical nodes. This in turn results in large fluctuations in sound pressure with time at any specified location in the duct, thus presenting a significant challenge for an ANC system with fixed control source and error sensor locations. In many food processing industries, the use of sound absorptive materials in silencers is not acceptable and, particularly when the fan speed is variable, it is difficult to achieve an acceptable passive solution at a reasonable cost.

40|$|Physically decentralised water {{management}} systems {{may contribute to}} improving the sustainability of urban {{water management}}. Any shift toward decentralised systems needs to consider not just <b>physical</b> <b>system</b> <b>design</b> but also social values, knowledge frames, and organisations, and their interconnections to the physical technology. Four cases of recent Australian urban water management improvement projects were researched using qualitative methods. Three cases were of decentralised water management innovation. The other was of a centralised system, although decentralised options had been considered. These cases were studied to identify institutional barriers and enablers for the uptake of decentralised systems, and to better understand how emerging environmental engineering knowledge might be applied to overcome an implementation gap for decentralised urban water technologies. Analysis of each case focused on the institutional elements of urban water management, namely: the values, knowledge frames and organisational structures. These elements were identified through in-depth interviews, document review, and an on-line survey. The alignment of these elements was identified as being a significant contributor to the stability of centralised systems, or to change toward decentralised systems. A new organisational home for innovative knowledge {{was found to be}} common to each case where decentralised innovation occurred. &# 145;Institutional entrepreneurs&# 146;, strong stakeholder engagement, and inter-organisational networks were all found to be linked to the creation of shared meaning and legitimacy for organisational and technological change.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} application of a liquid desiccant dehumidifier system in confined building spaces. The proposed dehumidifier system controls the humidity ratio of the confined space when a large amount of moisture is released, and uses ambient space air for regeneration when the spaces produce no moisture. The generated moisture air during the regeneration period can be discharged through continuous exhaust ventilation. ^ In the dissertation, the <b>physical</b> <b>system</b> <b>design</b> is described and dehumidifier performance models and CFD models are integrated and developed. Numerical simulations were conducted to compare the results of a conventional ventilation system and a dehumidifier system. ^ The results of the simulations show that the dehumidifier system reduced moisture condensation by 24. 0 % over a conventional exhaust ventilation system. It was also found that the configurations of the confined space and dehumidifier, e. g., the locations of the inlet air, exhaust air and moisture source, significantly impacted the space air humidity ratio and temperature distributions. ^ The theoretical analysis in the feasibility investigation suggests that an optimal dehumidifier system reduces moisture condensation and saves energy. Thus, the system optimizations are achieved by three approaches: optimal dehumidifier design parameters, improved dehumidifier location, and optimal regeneration period. ^ The results of the optimizations show that an improved dehumidifier location can reduce moisture condensation by 33. 1 % over the original dehumidifier location in the feasibility investigation. In addition, use of an optimal reheat desiccant temperature can reduce the regeneration period by 16. 0 % and the total performance period by 12. 5 %. ^ Yearly energy consumption and cost were compared between a base ventilation system and an optimal dehumidifier system for a bathroom in a hotel at two locations of Miami and Omaha. The comparisons were conducted for both systems with the same amount of accumulated condensation on the surfaces of the space. The total yearly electricity energy consumption in an optimal dehumidifier system can be saved by 63. 7 % in Omaha and 65. 2 % in Miami. The heating consumption can be saved by 66. 7 % in Omaha and 66. 7 % in Miami. The average yearly energy cost saving is around 65. 5 %. ...|$|E

40|$|Mechatronics is {{a natural}} stage in the {{evolution}} of modern products, many containing components from different engineering domains, such as mechanical, electrical, and software control systems. As part of concurrent engineering practice, mechatronics is a synergistic system design philosophy to optimize the system as a whole simultaneously. Yet there is still lack of support of this design principle in practice. To date, conventional design tools have been limited to single domain problems and require a trial-and-error synthesis process. In order to support the concurrent synthesis process of mechatronic products, theoretical modeling of multi-domain engineering systems, with a formal unified representation and a well-defined algorithmic and flexible synthesis procedure, is needed. These are essential to accommodate the complexity of such systems and support the design automation process. ^ In this work, multi-domain mechatronic system design is treated as a network synthesis problem, extending from single domain electrical network synthesis. Desired design performance is specified in an impedance matrix that captures the dynamic relations of effort and flow variables at input-output interaction ports. An extended multi-port bond graph representation is developed to unify power and signal flows at a high-level abstraction across engineering domains, which also integrates active control system design. The unified representation of both physical systems and their control systems in bond graphs is achieved by applying “controller design in the physical domain” philosophy, to design and synthesize the whole system simultaneously at the conceptual design stage. The graphical structure of bond graphs being close to reality also gives intuitive physical insight of the interactions among physical components for detailed level design realization and simulation in different domains to verify the entire system. ^ This approach makes full use of computational power to automatically explore the design space for both design configuration and parameterization utilizing biology-inspired optimization techniques: genetic algorithms, genetic programming, and coevolution. Bond graph elements are encoded as genetic programming functional and terminal primitives, to evolve low-level building blocks to high-level functionality by applying genetic operations based on population-based natural evolution. It aids design exploration of a wider range of possible creative design options and achieves synergy in coevolving different subsystems, including both active control strategies and <b>physical</b> <b>system</b> <b>design</b> configurations, for overall system optimality. ^ Two mechatronic design case studies are provided: a one-axis robotic manipulator system and a quarter-car suspension system. The computational results are compared with the design solutions obtained by human designers from trial-and-error synthesis and theoretical analysis. The coevolutionary synthesis approach is capable of discovering design options with better performance, more creativity and flexibility than those perceived by human designers. It is our belief that the establishment of such mechanism will enhance the capability of computers to automatically generate and evaluate innovative and alternative solutions to multi-domain dynamic systems and enable intelligent assistance to engineering designers at the early stages of system modeling and development for concurrent engineering practices. ...|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{means of}} {{controlling}} sound radiated by electrical power transformers involve {{the construction of}} large expensive barriers or full enclosures, which cause maintainability and cooling problems. One promising alternative is to use active noise control to cancel the noise. This thesis is concerned {{with one of the}} many problems which need to be investigated to develop a practical active noise cancellation system for transformers. This work, in particular, is concerned with the <b>physical</b> <b>system</b> <b>design</b> which includes the selection of the control source types and the evaluation of the near-field sensing strategies. Loudspeakers have been widely used in the past as an acoustic source for canceling transformer noise. The principal disadvantage of using loudspeakers is that to achieve global noise control, a large number, driven by a multi-channel controller, are required. However, if large panels are used in place of loudspeakers as control sources, {{it is possible that the}} number of the control sources and complexity of the controller could be reduced substantially. In addition to reducing the number of control sources and simplifying their application, panel sound sources could also overcome some disadvantages of the loudspeakers, such as limited life and deterioration due to the weather. Thus, part of the work described in this thesis is concerned with the development of a resonant curved panel with a backing cavity as an acoustic type source. The advantages of using a curved panel rather than a flat panel are twofold: first a curved panel is more easily excited by the extensional motion of the piezoelectric patch actuators; and second, it is more difficult to adjust the resonance frequencies of the efficient modes of a flat panel than of a curved panel. The analytical models for the design of the panel cavity systems have been developed. As an example, a resonant curved panel with a backing cavity system was constructed and the sound radiation of the system was measured. Results show that a resonant panel-cavity sound source could be used as an alternative to a number of loudspeakers for active cancellation of electric power transformer noise. Due to the advantages of using the vibration type control sources, two types of vibration control sources (inertial electrodynamic shakers and piezoelectric patch actuators) were considered and the mechanical output of the inertial shakers has been compared with that of the piezoelectric actuators. In contrast with the piezoelectric actuators, the resonance frequencies of the inertial shakers can be tuned to the frequencies of interest using simple tuning procedures, so that the output efficiency of the shakers can be increased. The output performance was evaluated for two types of actuators by measuring the structural response of either a panel or a transformer when excited by the actuators at half their rated voltage input. Results demonstrated that a much larger output amplitude at the frequency of interest can be achieved by the tuned inertial type actuators. Two near-field sensing strategies, the minimization of the sum of the sound intensities and the minimization of the sum of the squared sound pressures, have been studied. A quadratic expression was derived for the minimization of the sum of the sound intensities in the near-field. To evaluate the control performances achieved using both sensing strategies, a flat-panel was modelled with a harmonic point force disturbance and several point force control sources. Simulation results show that the control performance could be improved by minimizing the sum of the sound intensities in the hydrodynamic near-field, provided that a very large number of error sensors were used, otherwise better results were achieved using near-field squared pressure sensing. Both sensing strategies were used to predict the noise reductions that resulted for the active noise control of a small transformer in the laboratory environment and for a large electrical power transformer on site. To optimize the locations of the control sources (for the large transformer on site) and the locations of the error sensors (for the small transformer in the laboratory environment), a genetic algorithm (GA), which is an evolutionary optimization technique, was employed as a search procedure to optimize the control source and error sensor locations. The results showed that the control source locations and/or the error sensor locations must be optimized to achieve the maximum sound reduction for either error sensing strategy, especially for the sound intensity minimization; otherwise, the sound field level may increase after control due to the character of the cost function (the sum of the sound intensities). The simulation results were experimentally validated for the small transformer in the laboratory environment. Due to the limitation of the number of controller channels, the control performance was only evaluated for squared pressure minimization. The results demonstrated that for the case of 8 control sources and 8 error sensors, at 100 Hz, an average sound pressure reduction of 15. 8 dB was achieved when evaluated at 528 monitoring locations at 0. 25 m intervals on a surface that surrounded the transformer.

40|$|Information poverty {{cannot be}} {{addressed}} by simply giving away computers and installing internet connections in rural areas. What is really needed is to offer rural users relevant, personalized information {{that enables them to}} make positive changes in their daily lives, rather than give them the type of information that is typically available via public internet sites. ICT should be viewed as a tool, and not as the solution to building knowledge-based societies. ICT encompasses the full range of information and communication technologies, including radio, television and print media as well as the ever-expanding array of computer hardware and software, telecom devices, internet and portable digital media. To build a knowledge-based society, many organizations and enterprises have given rise to a range of innovative projects and services. These innovative projects attempt to use ICT to enable rural users to access relevant information services with a view to ultimately reducing information poverty. Where information poverty can be understood as a lack of knowledge to make decisions to improve wellbeing in terms of economic and social development. Information services have been offered in crosscutting sectors such as education, e-governance, agriculture, and healthcare. Reducing information poverty through the use of ICT to improve user wellbeing is a major challenge for governmental and non-governmental organizations alike. Several new media ICT interventions such as Telecenters that offer e-services in domains such as agriculture, healthcare, and education have recently been deployed in India. Despite huge investment in recent efforts to address information poverty via new media ICT interventions, the results still do not make a convincing case for solving the information poverty problem. Consequently, there is still an information gap between rural users and the information offered via ICT interventions. The case study evaluation of ICT interventions deployed in India (Chapter 2) indicated that users have still not adopted the majority of these interventions. The low adoption level of ICT interventions could be attributed to the following key issues: a. The information content offered through the ICT interventions such as, telecenters is often found to be too general to be useful for rural users, and is inadequately disseminated. Existing ICT interventions are focused on introducing new applications and technologies to the rural market rather than on having a concrete understanding of user needs and the social environment. The term social environment of an individual can be understood as the culture that he or she was educated and/or lives in, and the people and institutions with whom the person interacts. The information offered via the ICT interventions on a particular topic, such as healthcare or agriculture, does not often take into consideration the existing information needs, daily practices, and the needs of the social environment of the rural communities. As a consequence, rural users do not see that the information given has any added value in their life. b. The sustainability of ICT interventions in a rural context is dependent on knowledge from several scientific disciplines such as, for example, social science for understanding societal issues at community and individual level; computer science for developing the software and hardware of an interactive device; industrial design for designing the user-interface and for usability testing; marketing for addressing issues of economic sustainability and technology adoption. However, the current development approaches are often dominated by a single discipline, namely - the technology development groups. This approach often leads to technology-centered development. Recent literature on ICT development discusses the need for a developmental framework to achieve sustainable ICT solutions (Chapter 3). As an answer to this call, several frameworks have recently been proposed by researchers and organizations involved in promoting ICT for rural development. These frameworks focus mainly on organizational issues, such as how an organization can improve its efforts regarding the design and implementation of ICT interventions in developing countries. However, none of the ICT development frameworks have taken a bottom-up approach, where it is the users who drive the problems and solutions. In particular, these frameworks fail to incorporate user needs, the socio-cultural context, and technological viability issues in the early development phase. Design can play a critical role towards developing a framework to support ICT development for rural communities. Design can address the developmental issues towards holistically improving information dissemination via ICT interventions, thereby achieving a high rate of adoption. Towards proposing a design framework for developing ICT products and services for rural development, this thesis dealt with finding the answers to the following two research challenges: The first research challenge was to incorporate knowledge from multiple disciplines in the user-centered design approach to develop sustainable ICT interventions. To meet this objective, a case study analysis was first conducted to understand where existing ICT development approaches succeed or fail (see Chapter 2). The findings from the case study analysis provided requirements for the design framework to support ICT development for rural communities. Based on the requirement for the framework, this thesis put forward a design framework that amalgamates theories from multiple disciplines such as social sciences, computer science, industrial design and marketing management, and involves different stakeholders to support the main stages in the user-centered development process (see Chapter 3). The design framework consists of two main components: Component A includes the user-centered phases of the design cycle. The three stages of the usercentered development process in the proposed design framework have been termed: Exploratory Research, Creative Design Research, and Evaluative Research. Component B, the theoretical framework, explains the theories from multiple disciplines that have been adapted to guide the development process followed in component A. Both these components were interlinked with each other where component B provided the theoretical foundation to the various stages in the user-centered process as defined in component A (see Chapter 3). The second research challenge was to design and develop ICT interventions for socially complex environments in order to improve information dissemination and increase user-adoption of ICT intervention. As a development case, an ICT intervention focusing on disseminating primary health information to rural women was developed by following the proposed design framework. Following the exploratory phase of the design framework, field studies were then conducted in Gujarat, India. The purpose of the field studies was to obtain baseline data on user needs and to understand the socio-cultural norms of rural women surrounding their health practices, and to investigate the knowledge level of rural women relating to menses and maternal health (see Chapter 4). Chapter 4 describes the exploratory research phase of the proposed design framework. This phase included two studies (1 and 2) conducted with the baseline group (rural women) and potential stakeholders in the pilot villages of Gujarat, India. The studies were conducted to identify the existing knowledge level (baseline survey) and the social beliefs and practices of rural women relating to menses and maternal health. The theory of planned behavior was adopted in the exploratory stage as a means to understand the social norms and user needs for developing an ICT intervention. The questionnaire used was based on the three factors of the theory of planned behavior that affect human action: Attitude toward the Behavior, Subjective Norm, and Perceived Behavioral Control. The results from studies 1 and 2 indicated that the knowledge level of rural women on matters relating to menses and maternal health was low. The results illustrate that there exist social beliefs and health practices that inhibit the acceptance of good health practices relating to menses and maternal health. We concluded from the exploratory stage that, in order to improve the knowledge level of rural women, the social beliefs and practices as identified need to be positively shaped. This implies that in ICT development, besides understanding the social beliefs and attitudes of the target user group, it is critical to incorporate them in the design of nformation content and the physical environment. The PHIS was developed {{as a part of the}} creative design phase of the proposed design framework (Chapter 5). The PHIS design integrates theories from multiple disciplines, such as social cues from persuasive technology, and the theory of planned behavior for shaping the social beliefs and health practices of rural women. Concept 1 of the PHIS was developed on the basis of the design requirements obtained in the exploratory phase (Chapter 4). The design and development process employed persuasive technology in designing information communication strategies, the physical environment, and the <b>physical</b> <b>system</b> <b>design</b> of the PHIS. The role of persuasive technology was to shape existing social norms via an interactive system and to motivate the rural women to have a high behavior intention, thereby increasing their perceived behavior control. The PHIS used a computer as a tool, a medium, and a social actor to create a persuasive interactive experience for the rural women to shape their social beliefs. Social cues from persuasive technology such as physical cues, language cues, psychological cues, social dynamics, and social roles were applied in the PHIS for shaping social beliefs and the health attitude of rural women in India. Studies 3 & 4 were conducted to evaluate the first concept of the PHIS. Firstly, an initial impact study (study 3) was conducted to compare user engagement between the PHIS (village B) and the local NGO-health information system (village A). Results from the comparative study reported an increase in user engagement with the PHIS compared with the NGO health system (see Chapter 5). The results showed an increase in the number of revisits and in the number of questions asked by the rural women using the PHIS compared with the NGO system. Secondly, an evaluative study (study 4) was conducted to evaluate the PHIS on the basis of Rogers innovation attributes from diffusion theory. Feedback from rural women was collected against four product innovation attributes: Relative, Advantage, Compatibility, Complexity, and Observability. The women using the PHIS reported high values against the four innovation attributes. For example, the PHIS gave them privacy and the freedom to access health information. Therefore, the rural women ranked it high on the “relative advantage” attribute compared with the NGO system. We concluded from studies 3 & 4 that applying social cues from persuasive technology in designing the form, content and interaction of the PHIS can positively shape the social beliefs of the users. For example, to incorporate psychological cues from persuasive technology in the PowerPoint slides, three animated characters representing local identities were used to convey the relevant messages. These characters represented the main characters found in the village community, and included (a) a teenage girl for discussing menses issues; (b) a married woman for discussing maternal issues; and (c) a doctor for answering the queries. Traditional folk music and puppet shows were used to convey the stories woven around these characters. In all six categories, the three characters presented existing beliefs through cases and discussed their effects rationally. It can be concluded from the results that by offering belief-based content the health information dissemination process can be improved and hence user engagement. The findings from the creative design phase informed the design of Concept 2 of the proposed ICT intervention termed the Mobile Persuasive Health Information System (MPHIS) (see Chapter 6). Concept 2, the MPHIS was designed to make the PHIS mobile and enhance social interaction by using traditional metaphors in the user interface design. The results from the MPHIS evaluative study (Study 5) illustrated increased social interaction as a result of enhanced product engagement, product attachment, and increased community decision-making. As a consequence of increased social interaction, sensitive health information relating to menses and maternal health was easily disseminated to the rural women. The reflection of traditional metaphors on design reduced the technology barrier prevalent among rural women, and therefore increased their engagement when interacting with the MPHIS. Furthermore, because the MPHIS was mobile, rural women from remote villages could also access the system, which was previously not possible with the PHIS. We concluded from Study 5 that by adapting traditional metaphors to design the Tangible User Interface (TUI), a personalized relationship between the interactive system and the user can be developed. This allows even those users with limited exposure to technology to access the relevant information independently. As part of the evaluative research, we measured the impact of the PHIS intervention on the knowledge level and health practices relating to menses and maternal health of rural women. In this thesis, an increase in knowledge level and the positive change in heath practices among rural women has been considered to be an indicator of a high rate of adoption of the PHIS intervention (see Chapter 3). In order to investigate the rate of PHIS adoption, a longitudinal study (Study 6) was conducted for sixteen months (see Chapter 7). The purpose of this study was to investigate the changes in the knowledge level of rural women and in their health practices relating to maternal health and menstruation between the village in which the women received no intervention (baseline group) and the village in which women received the PHIS intervention (intervention group). The results from Study 6 between the baseline group and intervention group indicated the difference in knowledge level of rural women who did and did not receive the intervention. The results from the longitudinal study indicated that the PHIS intervention had a positive impact on improving the knowledge level of rural women and brought about positive changes in their health practices. The data from the control group indicated that the improvement in knowledge level determined from the comparison between the intervention and baseline groups was not influenced by any external factors. The results from the longitudinal study indicate a positive impact of the PHIS intervention in improving the knowledge level of rural women. The follow-up observation conducted by the PHIS operators and community health workers revealed positive changes in the daily health practices of rural women. These changes were mainly observed in the disposal of menstrual cloths, maintaining personal hygiene, nutritional habits and delivery practices. For example, after the PHIS intervention, the women learned that it was possible to burn used cloths in their backyard. It was observed that (n= 82 / 120) rural women adopted this new practice. Previously the used cloth had been stored in an unhygienic place and was not dried in the open in the sun because rural women did not understand that menstruation was simply a normal biological process. After accessing health information from the PHIS, (n= 42 / 120) rural women reported that they changed the cotton cloths every two months, and that they dried them in the sun to sterilize them. These results could be attributed to the fact that the content was dynamically updated by the operators in accordance with the information needs and existing health practices of the rural women. The results from Study 6 lead to the conclusion that the necessary information relating to personal health that is consistently reinforced and is in compliance with existing social beliefs and practices may lead to a change in health-related practices. Disseminating information specifically designed for women, and through an intervention that engages them to interact in groups to discuss their personal health issues, may lead to positive changes in their health practices. Additionally, we conclude that information that directly adds value to the participant’s daily life may have a positive influence on the rate of adoption of ICT intervention. Key findings and implications from the various studies conducted during this research are reported on in Chapter 8 which discusses in particular the relevance of organizing multi-disciplinary collaboration in the design process of ICT development, the need to investigate existing social beliefs and practices, and issues surrounding stakeholder involvement and capacity development in ICT interventions. I have made an attempt with this thesis to demonstrate the strength of industrial design as a discipline to address socially complex problems in the rural context. In order to shape the social beliefs and health practices of rural women, two persuasive health information systems were developed by following the proposed design framework. However, I am aware of the fact that it is too soon to generalize or to judge the reliability of this framework in terms of guiding user-centered ICT development. The design framework still needs to be rigorously tested when designing other ICT projects deployed in a rural context, such as e-governance, distant education, and tele-medicine services. In terms of testing the reliability of the proposed design framework, the spinoff project from this thesis -called “Savera” -will follow the three phase design framework and we expect to draw some general lessons from this experience. This thesis should be considered as an example of how a bottom-up approach that involves users in the content development and the design process could lead to user-centered ICT developments for the rural context.
