5|$|A {{knowledge}} of pKa values {{is important for}} the quantitative treatment of systems involving acid–base equilibria in solution. Many applications exist in biochemistry; for example, the pKa values of proteins and amino acid side chains are of major importance for the activity of enzymes and the stability of proteins. Protein pKa values cannot always be measured directly, but may be calculated using theoretical methods. Buffer solutions are used extensively to provide solutions at or near the physiological pH for the study of biochemical reactions; the design of these solutions depends on a {{knowledge of}} the pKa values of their components. Important buffer solutions include MOPS, which provides a solution with pH 7.2, and tricine, which is used in gel electrophoresis. Buffering {{is an essential part of}} acid base physiology including acid–base homeostasis, and is key to understanding disorders such as acid–base imbalance. The isoelectric point of a given molecule is a function of its pK values, so different molecules have different isoelectric points. This permits a technique called isoelectric focusing, which is used for separation of proteins by 2-D gel <b>polyacrylamide</b> <b>gel</b> electrophoresis.|$|E

40|$|The {{validity}} of the affine assumption in model flexible polymer networks is explored. To this end, the displacements of fluorescent tracer beads embedded in <b>polyacrylamide</b> <b>gels</b> are quantified by confocal microscopy under shear deformation, and the deviations of these displacements from affine responses are recorded. Non-affinity within the gels is quantified {{as a function of}} polymer chain density and cross-link concentration. Observations are in qualitative agreement with current theories of polymer network non-affinity. The measured degree of non-affinity in the <b>polyacrylamide</b> <b>gels</b> suggests the presence of structural inhomogeneities which likely result from heterogeneous reaction kinetics during gel preparation.

25|$|For proteins, SDS-PAGE {{is usually}} the first choice as an assay of purity due to its {{reliability}} and ease. The presence of SDS and the denaturing step make proteins separate, approximately based on size, but aberrant migration of some proteins may occur. Different proteins may also stain differently, which interferes with quantification by staining. PAGE may {{also be used as}} a preparative technique for the purification of proteins. For example, quantitative preparative native continuous <b>polyacrylamide</b> <b>gel</b> electrophoresis (QPNC-PAGE) is a method for separating native metalloproteins in complex biological matrices.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} used method is to perform a Western blot against the protein of interest—this gives information {{on the size of}} the protein in addition to its identity. A sample (often cellular lysate) is separated on a <b>polyacrylamide</b> <b>gel,</b> transferred to a membrane and then probed with an antibody to the protein of interest. The antibody can either be conjugated to a fluorophore or to horseradish peroxidase for imaging and/or quantification. The gel-based nature of this assay makes quantification less accurate, but it has the advantage of being able to identify later modifications to the protein, for example proteolysis or ubiquitination, from changes in size.|$|E
25|$|Proteins, unlike nucleic acids, {{can have}} varying charges and complex shapes, {{therefore}} {{they may not}} migrate into the <b>polyacrylamide</b> <b>gel</b> at similar rates, or at all, when placing a negative to positive EMF on the sample. Proteins therefore, are usually denatured {{in the presence of}} a detergent such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) that coats the proteins with a negative charge. Generally, the amount of SDS bound is relative to the size of the protein (usually 1.4g SDS per gram of protein), so that the resulting denatured proteins have an overall negative charge, and all the proteins have a similar charge-to-mass ratio. Since denatured proteins act like long rods instead of having a complex tertiary shape, the rate at which the resulting SDS coated proteins migrate in the gel is relative only to its size and not its charge or shape.|$|E

2500|$|The {{types of}} gel most {{typically}} used are agarose and <b>polyacrylamide</b> <b>gels.</b> [...] Each type of gel is well-suited to different types and sizes of analyte. [...] <b>Polyacrylamide</b> <b>gels</b> are usually used for proteins, and have very high resolving power for small fragments of DNA (5-500 bp). [...] Agarose gels {{on the other}} hand have lower resolving power for DNA but have greater range of separation, and are therefore used for DNA fragments of usually 50-20,000 bp in size, but resolution of over 6 Mb is possible with pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). [...] <b>Polyacrylamide</b> <b>gels</b> are run in a vertical configuration while agarose gels are typically run horizontally in a submarine mode. [...] They also differ in their casting methodology, as agarose sets thermally, while polyacrylamide forms in a chemical polymerization reaction.|$|R
25|$|For the {{analysis}} of the functioning of proteins in a cell, the knowledge of their cooperation is essential. Most often proteins act together in complexes to be fully functional. The analysis of this sub organelle organisation of the cell requires techniques conserving the native state of the protein complexes. In native <b>polyacrylamide</b> <b>gel</b> electrophoresis (native PAGE), proteins remain in their native state and are separated in the electric field following their mass and the mass of their complexes respectively. To obtain a separation by size and not by net charge, as in IEF, an additional charge is transferred to the proteins by the use of Coomassie Brilliant Blue or lithium dodecyl sulfate. After completion of the first dimension the complexes are destroyed by applying the denaturing SDS-PAGE in the second dimension, where the proteins of which the complexes are composed of are separated by their mass.|$|E
25|$|The analyte {{molecules}} {{in a sample}} can be partially ordered {{with respect to the}} external magnetic field of the spectrometer by manipulating the sample conditions. Common techniques include addition of bacteriophages or bicelles to the sample, or preparation of the sample in a stretched <b>polyacrylamide</b> <b>gel.</b> This creates a local environment that favours certain orientations of nonspherical molecules. Normally in solution NMR the dipolar couplings between nuclei are averaged out because of the fast tumbling of the molecule. The slight overpopulation of one orientation means that a residual dipolar coupling remains to be observed. The dipolar coupling is commonly used in solid state NMR and provides information about the relative orientation of the bond vectors relative to a single global reference frame. Typically the orientation of the N-H vector is probed in a HSQC like experiment. Initially, residual dipolar couplings were used for refinement of previously determined structures, but attempts at de novo structure determination have also been made.|$|E
25|$|Another technique, AmpFLP, or amplified {{fragment}} length polymorphism {{was also}} {{put into practice}} during the early 1990s. This technique was also faster than RFLP analysis and used PCR to amplify DNA samples. It relied on variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphisms to distinguish various alleles, which were separated on a <b>polyacrylamide</b> <b>gel</b> using an allelic ladder (as opposed to a molecular weight ladder). Bands could be visualized by silver staining the gel. One popular focus for fingerprinting was the D1S80 locus. As with all PCR based methods, highly degraded DNA or very small amounts of DNA may cause allelic dropout (causing a mistake in thinking a heterozygote is a homozygote) or other stochastic effects. In addition, because the analysis is done on a gel, very high number repeats may bunch together {{at the top of}} the gel, making it difficult to resolve. AmpFLP analysis can be highly automated, and allows for easy creation of phylogenetic trees based on comparing individual samples of DNA. Due to its relatively low cost and ease of set-up and operation, AmpFLP remains popular in lower income countries.|$|E

25|$|To {{create a}} western blot, gel {{electrophoresis}} {{is used to}} separate native proteins by 3-D structure or denatured proteins by {{the length of the}} polypeptide. <b>Polyacrylamide</b> <b>gel</b> is generally used for the electrophoretic separation of proteins, and SDS is generally used as a buffer (as well as in the gel) in order to give all proteins present a uniform negative charge, since proteins can be positively, negatively, or neutrally charged. This type of electrophoresis is known as SDS-PAGE (SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). Prior to electrophoresis, protein samples are often boiled to denature the proteins present. This ensures that proteins are separated based on size and prevents proteases (enzymes that break down proteins) from degrading samples. Following electrophoretic separation, the proteins are transferred to a membrane (typically nitrocellulose or PVDF), where they are blocked with milk (or other blocking agents) to prevent non-specific antibody binding, and then stained with antibodies specific to the target protein. Lastly, the membrane will be stained with a secondary antibody that recognizes the first antibody staining, which can then be used for detection by a variety of methods. The gel electrophoresis step is included in western blot analysis to resolve the issue of the cross-reactivity of antibodies.|$|E
25|$|<b>Polyacrylamide</b> <b>gel</b> (PAG) {{had been}} known as a {{potential}} embedding medium for sectioning tissues as early as 1964, and two independent groups employed PAG in electrophoresis in 1959. It possesses several electrophoretically desirable features that make it a versatile medium. It is a synthetic, thermo-stable, transparent, strong, chemically relatively inert gel, and can be prepared {{with a wide range}} of average pore sizes. The pore size of a gel and the reproducibility in gel pore size are determined by three factors, the total amount of acrylamide present (%T) (T = Total concentration of acrylamide and bisacrylamide monomer), the amount of cross-linker (%C) (C = bisacrylamide concentration), and the time of polymerization of acrylamide (cf. QPNC-PAGE). Pore size decreases with increasing %T; with cross-linking, 5%C gives the smallest pore size. Any increase or decrease in %C from 5% increases the pore size, as pore size with respect to %C is a parabolic function with vertex as 5%C. This appears to be because of non-homogeneous bundling of polymer strands within the gel. This gel material can also withstand high voltage gradients, is amenable to various staining and destaining procedures, and can be digested to extract separated fractions or dried for autoradiography and permanent recording.|$|E
500|$|... (1) Most often, 5'-DMT {{group is}} removed {{at the end}} of the {{oligonucleotide}} chain assembly. The oligonucleotides are then released from the solid phase and deprotected (base and phosphate) by treatment with aqueous ammonium hydroxide, aqueous methylamine, their mixtures, gaseous ammonia or methylamine or, less commonly, solutions of other primary amines or alkalies at ambient or elevated temperature. This removes all remaining protection groups from 2'-deoxyoligonucleotides, resulting in a reaction mixture containing the desired product. If the oligonucleotide contains any 2'-O-protected ribonucleotide residues, the deprotection protocol includes the second step where the 2'-O-protecting silyl groups are removed by treatment with fluoride ion by various methods. The fully deprotected product is used as is, or the desired oligonucleotide can be purified by a number of methods. Most commonly, the crude product is desalted using ethanol precipitation, size exclusion chromatography, or reverse-phase HPLC. To eliminate unwanted truncation products, the oligonucleotides can be purified via <b>polyacrylamide</b> <b>gel</b> electrophoresis or anion-exchange HPLC followed by desalting.|$|E
