To {{study the}} {{association}} of the polymorphic variants of ACE (I/D), AT 2 R 1 (A 1166 C), TNF-alpha (G 308 A), MTHFR (C 677 T) genes and their combinations with the risk of <b>perinatal</b> <b>pathology</b> and gestation reduction. Methods. The polymorphic variants of genes were analyzed by PCR and RFLP in 235 newborns with severe <b>perinatal</b> <b>pathology</b> and 110 clinically healthy term newborns. Results. An increased risk of severe <b>perinatal</b> <b>pathology</b> was associated with such genotypes: DD and ID (ACE), 1166 AC, 1166 CC (AT 2 R 1), 677 CT (MTHFR), 308 AA and 308 AG (TNF-alpha), this risk for homozygotes is almost 2 -fold higher than for heterozygotes.

It is especially relevant in premature infants and the children born with various <b>perinatal</b> <b>pathologies.</b> Scientific literature features the primary reasons of weaning: work activity resumption by nursing mothers, milk deficiency, breast refusal, insufficient awareness of mothers. The article presents results of two studies performed at the Scientific Center of Children’s Health. Results of a medical-psychological-pedagogical questioning of 85 mothers of premature infants demonstrate insufficient work of medical personnel {{in the sphere of}} preserving breast feeding in whole and in the children born with <b>perinatal</b> <b>pathologies</b> in particular; and the need of young women and their families in obtaining information on the benefits of breast feeding, training and assistance in the course of parental performance.

40|$|Background: Premature {{infants with}} {{extremely}} low and very {{low birth weight}} with a severe overlapping <b>perinatal</b> <b>pathology</b> often feature slower growth rate within {{the first year of}} life and require special nutritional support. Objective: Our aim was to study physical development of infants with protein-calorie deficiency in the setting of using a specialized protein- and calorie-rich pediatric milk product for enteral feeding. Methods: We analyzed tolerability and efficacy of clinical nutrition within the framework of a prospective two-month-long case series. We assessed actual children’s diets and the chemical composition thereof. We determined body weight and length, body mass index (BMI), adipodermal flap thickness over the triceps. Anabolic effect of clinical nutrition was assessed on the basis of transthyretin concentration dynamics. Results: The study involved 30 infants with protein-calorie deficiency (7 term infants and 23 premature infants) with a severe <b>perinatal</b> <b>pathology.</b> High tolerability of the formula under analysis was registered in most patients. Termination of functional gastrointestinal tract disorders (posseting, colics, flatulence, constipations) was observed in 23 (87 %) patients. In most cases, the use of a protein- and calorie-rich formula {{as a part of a}} therapeutic diet helped to satisfy children’s protein demand and improve their weight/length parameters: BMI increased in 19 (72 %) children, body weight — in 16 (63 %), body length — in 24 (92 %), adipodermal flap thickness over the triceps — in all the children (100 %).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Despite recent {{advances}} in preterm newborns healthcare, <b>perinatal</b> <b>pathologies</b> and disabilities are increasing. Oxidative stress (OS) is determinant for the onset of an unbalance between free radicals (FRs) production and antioxidant systems which {{plays a key role}} in pathogenesis of pathologies such as retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), grouped as 'free radical-related diseases' (FRD). AIM: This study tests the hypothesis that OS markers levels in cord blood may predict the onset of FRD pathologies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 168 preterm newborns of GA: 24 - 32 weeks (28. 09 +/- 1. 99); and BW: 470 - 2480 gr (1358. 11 +/- 454. 09) were consecutively recruited. Markers of potential OS risk (non-protein bound iron, NPBI; basal superoxide anion, BSA; under stimulation superoxide anion, USSA) and markers of OS-related damage (total hydroperoxides, TH; advanced oxidation protein products, AOPP) were assessed in cord blood. Associations between FRD onset and OS markers were checked through inferential analysis (univariate logistic regression).

40|$|Fulltext embargoed for: 12 months post date of publicationSubstantial {{advances}} {{have been made}} in the last decade on our understanding of the basic physiology underlying neurogenesis in the postnatal mammalian brain. The bulk of the work in this area has been based on analysis of the adult brain. Relatively less is known about the capacity for neurogenesis in specific structures within the neonatal brain. Here we report that the production of medium spiny striatal projection neurons extends into the early neonatal period under normal physiological conditions in the rat brain. Birth-dating of newborn cells with bromodeoxyuridine at postnatal days 0, 2 and 5 showed a peak production close to birth, which sharply declined at the later time-points. Additionally, there was a low-level but stable contribution of neurons with interneuron identity over the same time-period. Importantly, retroviral labelling of new striatal projection neurons with green fluorescent protein showed long-term survival and terminal differentiation with characteristic morphology, including highly elaborated spiny dendrites, and appropriate axonal targeting of the globus pallidus and midbrain. This latent period of striatal neurogenesis in the early neonatal brain represents an interesting target for regenerative approaches aimed at restoring striatal circuitry in <b>perinatal</b> <b>pathologies,</b> such as hypoxic and ischaemic damage associated with cerebral palsy.

The article presents the main stages of securing priority of breastfeeding for healthy infants: the history of development of the commonly known “ten steps” of breastfeeding for obstetric institutions and the objective impediments to implementation of these steps at neonatal resuscitation and intensive care units (NRICUs) and neonatal pathology units. A group of experts of the World Health Organization summarized experience of several neonatal inpatient hospitals in the framework of the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative and formulated the basic principles of breastfeeding support for implementation at NRICUs. The experts emphasize utmost importance of a long-lasting contact with the mother (skin-to-skin) and teaching lactation preservation methods to mothers for the support of breastfeeding of premature infants. An attitude toward withdrawal from other feeding methods, rubber teats and pacifiers, as well as organization of breastfeeding “upon request” from premature infants is restricted due to peculiarities of health status and physiological maturity of such children. The experts state that mothers must remain with premature infants around the clock and the necessity of contact with other family members. They also emphasize the importance of preparation of parents to breastfeeding maintenance after discharge from hospital. Implementation of these modified approaches is expected to contribute to successful prolonged breastfeeding of premature infants.  </p...|$|R

40|$|Hyaline {{membrane}} disease (HMD), the pathologic correlate {{of respiratory}} distress syndrome (RDS) of the newborn, is an acute lung disease of premature infant caused by inadequate amounts of surfactant. Decreased surfactant results in insufficient surface {{tension in the}} alveolus during expiration, leading to atelectasis, decreased gas exchange, severe hypoxia and acidosis. HMD predominantly occurs in infants younger than 32 weeks of gestation and weighing less than 1, 200 g. In the interpretation of <b>perinatal</b> lung <b>pathology,</b> {{it is necessary to}} consider the development of the immature lung, particulary in the third trimester. Microscopically HMD is characterized by the occurrence of dilated terminal and respiratory bronchioles and of alveolar ducts lined by acellular eosinophilic hyaline membranes. The membranes are composed of necrotic alveolar lining cells, amniotic fluid constituents and fibrin. Retinopathy of prematurity and bronchopulmonary dysplasia are late complications of RDS that usually occur in infants who weigh less than 1, 500 g and were maintained on a mechanical respiration more than 6 days. Here a pratical approach to a microscopic analysis of the lung in newborns died with the clinical setting of RDS is presented. The most important pathological findings for a complete clinical pathological diagnosis are: the evaluation of the architectural lung development; the endothelial cell lesions; the interstitial edema; the occurrence of disseminated intravascular coagulation; the presence of associated inflammatory lesions. The usefulness of some immunohistochemical stains is also underlined, including anti-surfactant, anti-smooth muscle actin and anti-CD 31 to better evaluate surfactant production, pulmonary artery maturation and endothelial cell damage, respectively. Finally, the prevalent role of endothelial dysfunction and endothelial barrier loss is underlined, representing a major pathological event in the deposition of HMD.   Proceedings of the International Course on Perinatal Pathology (part of the 10 th International Workshop on Neonatology · October 22 nd - 25 th, 2014)  · Cagliari (Italy) · October 25 th, 2014  ·  The role of the clinical pathological dialogue in problem solving Guest Editors: Gavino Faa, Vassilios Fanos, Peter Van Eyken </p...|$|R

METHODS: A 4 year retrospective review of spontaneous midgestation abortions for which autopsy and microbiological cultures of placental and fetal tissue were performed was conducted for a tertiary obstetrics hospital, {{which included a}} regional referral service for <b>perinatal</b> and fetal <b>pathology.</b> One hundred twenty-nine spontaneously delivered, nonmacerated, midgestation fetuses or stillbirths (of between 16 and 26 weeks' gestation) and placentas were examined and cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, yeasts, and genital mycoplasmas. RESULTS: Microorganisms were recovered in 85 (66 %) cases (57 % placentas, 49 % fetuses). Among the culture positive cases, 81 % had histological chorioamnionitis, 28 % fetal pneumonitis, 38 % clinical signs of infection, and 62 % ruptured membranes {{at the time of}} miscarriage. These differed significantly from culture-negative cases (44 %, 5 %, 13 %, and 34 %, respectively). Group B streptococcus (GBS) was the most significant pathogen, recovered in 21 cases, 13 as the sole isolate, 94 % with chorioamnionitis, and 47 % in women with intact membranes. Escherichia coli and Ureaplasma urealyticum (22 and 24 cases, respectively) occurred mostly as mixed infections, with ruptured membranes. GBS, MU urealyticum, and Streptococcus anginosus group were individually associated with chorioamnionitis, Bacteroides/Prevotella and S. anginosus with fetal pneumonitis. The spectrum of microorganisms was similar to that in preterm labor at later gestations; however, GBS appeared to be the most significant pathogen in midgestation miscarriage, especially with intact membranes.

40|$|Progesterone and its neuroactive metabolite, allopregnanolone, {{are present}} in high {{concentrations}} during pregnancy, but drop significantly following birth. Allopregnanolone influences foetal arousal and enhances cognitive and behavioural recovery following traumatic brain injury. Inhibition of allopregnanolone synthesis increases cell death in foetal animal brains with experimental hypoxia. We hypothesised that complications during pregnancy, such as early or preterm loss of placental steroids and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), would disrupt the foetal neurosteroid system, contributing to poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. This study aimed to investigate the effects of chronic inhibition of allopregnanolone synthesis before term and IUGR on developmental processes in the foetal brain. Guinea pig foetuses were experimentally growth restricted at mid-gestation and treated with finasteride, an inhibitor of allopregnanolone synthesis. Finasteride treatment reduced foetal brain allopregnanolone concentrations by up to 75 % and {{was associated with a}} reduction in myelin basic protein (MBP) (P= 0. 001) and an increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein expression in the subcortical white matter brain region (P< 0. 001). IUGR resulted in decreased MBP expression (P< 0. 01) and was associated with a reduction in the expression of steroidogenic enzyme 5 α-reductase (5 αR) type 2 in the foetal brain (P= 0. 061). Brain levels of 5 αR 1 were higher in male foetuses (P= 0. 008). Both IUGR and reduced foetal brain concentrations of allopregnanolone were associated with altered expression of myelination and glial cell markers within the developing foetal brain. The potential role of neurosteroids in protecting and regulating neurodevelopmental processes in the foetal brain may provide new directions for treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders in infants who are exposed to <b>perinatal</b> insults and <b>pathologies...</b>|$|R
40|$|In 145 {{patients}} with opioid addiction were studied prognostic factors {{of the formation}} of the disease and their medical and social consequences. In the examined patients duration of the narcotization was from 1 year to 15 years. Analysis of studies showed that the most significant adverse prognostic factors, determining formation rate of medical and social consequences in opioid addiction, may include: <b>perinatal</b> <b>pathology,</b> personality deviation in the premorbid; early age of onset of drug use; hereditary load addictive and mental illness; condition of upbringing; alcohol abuse prior to narcotization; prescription of narcotization. These constitutionally-biological factors are informative indicators in the predicting the formation of opioid dependence...|$|E
40|$|Although {{congenital}} infections {{have been}} known since ancient times, at present they constitute an evolution due to the broadening of diagnostic methods. Also, the histopathological examination of selected placentas has increased in <b>perinatal</b> <b>pathology.</b> All placentas should be examined grossly by the obstetrician or the neonatologist who must select the specimens to be sent for pathologic examination. The indications for selection at delivery to detect hematogenous infection are listed in Table 1. The placentas that do not meet guidelines for pathologic examination must be kept stored at 40 degrees C for at least 72 h. This routine ensures that the placentas of asymptomatic newborns who might present early manifestations suggestive of infection would be submittedfor pathologic examination...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{studied the}} {{clinical}} {{features of the}} infant with cerebral ischemia, hepatosplenomegaly and combined forms of <b>perinatal</b> <b>pathology.</b> Found {{the relationship between the}} pathological conditions of the early neonatal period and neonatal infections. In a survey of 224 infants participated maternity hospital № 2 in Krasnoyarsk. PCR method was studied serum of these children for the detection of DNA Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma genitalium, Ureaplasma sp., Cytomegalovirus and Herpes simplex type 1 and 2. Proved the highest rate of infection of children with combined perinatal diseases (48. 6 %) compared with children with cerebral ischemia (33. 3 %) and hepatosplenomegaly (36. 8 %). In this case, in healthy children of the control group data pathogens were detected...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{objectivity}} in histopathology {{is illustrated by}} an attempt to determine the normal range and significance of two observations, placental weight and secondary ossification, made in <b>perinatal</b> <b>pathology.</b> Neither offered a satisfactory estimation of fetal maturity. The placental weight provided little evidence of any primary placental dysfunction: the placenta was very small in association with only 50 % of the very small infants and a very small placental fetal weight ratio was an infrequent finding of doubtful significance. A method of classifying relatively retarded and advanced secondary ossification was devised. Significant retardation was found in association with males, growth retardation, some malformations, and multiple births: significantly advanced ossification was found in anencephaly...|$|E
40|$|The paper studies {{interrelation}} between {{immune system}} condition and circulating concentrations of neuropeptides and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) upon <b>perinatal</b> <b>pathology</b> in newborns and infants. Reactivity of cytokine and interleukin links of immune systems was found varying in newborns and infants with CNS hypoxic-ischemic pathology, accompanied by psychomotor retardation, a psycho-speech disorder, {{emotional and behavioral}} disorders (EBD) and paroxysmal syndrome. At admission irrespectively of a syndrome type in the patients with CNS hypoxic-ischemic pathology, {{as compared with the}} patients in the control group, circulating TNF-α and IL- 1 were found increased by 3. 4 - 4. 1 and 6. 4 - 7. 9 times, respectively. Release of S 100 protein and NSE seems to be the underlying mechanism for enhancement of synthesis and/or release of TNF-α and IL- 1 into circulation of patients with CNS hypoxic-ischemic pathology...|$|E
40|$|The {{existence}} {{of stem cells}} within the adult pancreas {{is supported by the}} ability of this organ to regenerate its endocrine component in various conditions such as pregnancy and following partial pancreatectomy. Several studies have shown that progenitor or adult stem cells may reside within the pancreas and particularly in the pancreatic ducts, including acinar cells and islets of Langerhans. The discovery of human pluripotent stem cells in the pancreas, and the possibility of development of strategies for generating these, represented a turning point for the therapeutic interventions of type 1 diabetes.
