The superlinear rate of convergence is superior {{to that of other}} methods with only linear convergence (such as line search). Moreover, not requiring the computation or approximation of function derivatives makes successive <b>parabolic</b> <b>interpolation</b> a popular alternative to other methods that do require them (such as gradient descent and Newton's method).|$|E

By studying the discretisation errors, we show that a minimum of 200 intercepts, with <b>parabolic</b> <b>interpolations</b> between discretised data profiles, {{have to be taken}} into consideration to calculate the parameters as accurately as possible. Experimental profiles were eroded by means of a numerical wear model, and it was shown that the Abbott parameters correlate well with the wear model parameters. Our numerical estimations of Abbott parameters were performed for electro-eroded, tool machined, polished, worn and sandblasted surfaces.

40|$|High {{sampling}} frequencies in acoustic wireless {{sensor network}} (AWSN) are required to achieve precise sound localisation. But they are also mean analysis time and memory intensive (i. e., huge data to be processed and more memory space to be occupied which form a burden on the nodes limited resources). Decreasing sampling rates below Nyquist criterion in acoustic source localisation (ASL) applications requires development of the existing time delay estimation techniques in order to overcome the challenge of low time resolution. This work proposes using envelope and wavelet transform to enhance {{the resolution of the}} received signals through the combination of different time-frequency contents. Enhanced signals are processed using cross-correlation in conjunction with a <b>parabolic</b> fit <b>interpolation</b> to calculate the time delay accurately. Experimental results show that using this technique, estimation accuracy was improved by almost a factor of 5 in the case of using 4. 8 [*]kHz sampling rate. Such a conclusion is useful for developing precise ASL without the need of any excessive sensor resources, particularly for structural health monitoring applications...|$|R

In a general setting we prove that for interpolation functors of type h the R-boundedness, the R-sectoriality, and the property(α) preserve under interpolation. In particular, {{this is true for}} the standard real and complex interpolation methods. (Partly, these results were indicated in [12], however, with just a very brief outline of their proofs.)

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{variable}} step size implementation of exponential Rosenbrock-type methods of orders 2, 3 and 4. These integrators require the evaluation of exponential and related functions of the Jacobian matrix. To this aim, the Real Leja Points Method is used. It is shown that the properties of this method combine well with the particular requirements of Rosenbrock-type integrators. We verify our implementation with some numerical experiments in Matlab, where we solve semilinear parabolic PDEs in one and two space dimensions. We further present some numerical experiments in Fortran, where we compare our method with other methods from literature. We find a great potential of our method for non-normal matrices. Such matrices typically arise in parabolic problems with large advection in combination with moderate diffusion and mildly stiff reactions.

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} a wireless relay network in a Rayleigh fading scenario where transmission power {{as well as}} transmission time per user are optimized. The criterion of optimization is the capacity. We apply an optimization algorithm based on Brent’s method. Hence, we employ <b>parabolic</b> <b>interpolation</b> for finding the optimum whenever possible {{in order to achieve}} a faster convergence. If <b>parabolic</b> <b>interpolation</b> is not suitable, we use golden section search which is a robust root-finding method. Optimization takes place in two steps. First, we optimize power allocation and consider time as parameter. Second, time is optimized. We demonstrate that, depending on the cooperation strategy, remarkable capacity gains over direct transmission can be achieved by multi-routing. However, for a high overall trans-mission power, direct transmission outperforms multi-hopping. Generally, capacity gains increase with decreasing overall system power, which demonstrates that relaying is beneficial for low overall transmission powers. I...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} initial synchronization of pseudo-noise code. A new code acquisition technique for spread-spectrum communication systems using band-limited chip waveforms is presented. Unlike conventional power detector based on testing the estimated maximum of the ambiguity function, the devised detector exploits a fast <b>parabolic</b> <b>interpolation,</b> running on three estimated ambiguity samples {{in the neighborhood of}} the coarse estimate. Performance analysis is carried out in comparison with conventional detector. Mathematical expressions for the probability of false alarm and detection are derived. They are numerically evaluated, under operating settings, by a reduced Tayloriquests expansion up to the second order. The theoretical results, substantiated by computer simulations, have evidenced that the devised method is well suited for asynchronous spread-spectrum communications. In particular, the acquisition performance depends on the actual offset between the received and the reference code waveforms, which are randomly distributed (in chip-asynchronous systems) within one sampling period. In fact, the <b>parabolic</b> <b>interpolation</b> technique outperforms the conventional detector {{for a wide range of}} code offsets because it is able to self-synchronize the testing variable around the true offset...|$|E

It consists on continuously transmitting a signal composed by multiple sine wave segments, each containing an integer number of periods. The frequency of each segment {{is different from}} the adjacent segments, but close to the transducer resonant frequency, to minimise the filtering effects of the system. The transmitted and received signals are cross-correlated to determine the time-of-flight (TOF). <b>Parabolic</b> <b>interpolation</b> on the cross-correlation’s magnitude is used to increase the accuracy of TOF estimation.

40|$|The authors propose new {{frequency}} estimators, {{with narrow}} frequency acquisition range, {{which are based}} on the calculation of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the input signal. The algorithms consist of two steps: coarse and fine search of the periodogram peak. This frequency estimator structure employing either <b>parabolic</b> <b>interpolation,</b> dichotomous search, two-rate spectral estimation or their combination for fine search allows a considerable decrease in computational load with respect to known estimators. The proposed estimators are shown to have accuracy performance close to that of the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator. ...|$|E

This range is defined to find the residual time delay after a coarse estimation. The minimum could be obtained by solving the function with a sufficiently fine grid of points. However, the fminbnd function of MATLAB is used for an efficient computation, which finds the minimum in the search interval.
