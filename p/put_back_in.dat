5|$|Caio Duilios first wartime patrol {{took place}} on 31 August. She {{and the rest of}} the fleet sailed to {{intercept}} the British battleship , which was steaming to Alexandria, and a convoy sailing to Malta. The Italian fleet did not have sufficient aerial reconnaissance, which, along with bad weather, prevented the Italians from locating the British forces. They <b>put</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> to Taranto on 1 September. Caio Duilio again put to sea on 7 September, in an attempt to catch the British Force H, but the Italian intelligence was faulty, as Force H was in the process of attacking Dakar. Caio Duilio returned to Taranto, where she remained until early November.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1980s, the chapel was {{extensively}} restored {{with the assistance}} of donations from Lady Norma Dalrymple-Champneys. During this work, the chandelier, given in 1885 by Provost Shadwell while still a Fellow, was <b>put</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> place, the organ was restored, the painting mounted behind the altar, and the chapel repainted. A list of former chaplains and organ scholars was erected in the ante-chapel. The Chaplain is Rev Dr Robert Tobin and the Senior Organ Scholar for 2010-11 was Edwin Lock. At that time David Maw was appointed Director of Chapel Music.|$|E
5|$|The {{walls of}} the Hall are {{decorated}} with paintings of noted patrons or members of the Inn, including Nicholas Bacon and Elizabeth I. During the Second World War the Hall {{was one of those}} buildings badly damaged during the Blitz. The Treasurers' Arms and paintings had been moved to a place of safety and were not damaged; during the rebuilding after the War they were <b>put</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the Hall, where they remain. The rebuilt hall was designed by Edward Maufe, and was formally opened in 1951 by the Duke of Gloucester.|$|E

In {{the lobby of the}} building are two Trump merchandise kiosks (one of which replaced a long public bench) operating out of compliance with city regulations. The city issued a notice of violation in July 2015, demanding the bench be <b>put</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> place. Although the Trump Organization initially said that the violation was without merit, a lawyer speaking for Trump's organization stated in January 2016 that the kiosks would be removed in two to four weeks, prior to an expected court ruling.|$|E
5|$|Despite being {{severely}} {{wounded in}} the head and leg during his escape from Wola, after a short stay in a hospital, Mazurkiewicz was <b>put</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> charge of the Radosław Group. He led an unsuccessful attempt in early September to evacuate to Śródmieście (City center, Warsaw) after Stare Miasto was overrun by German troops. After this failed, his group managed to make its way to the Czerniaków suburb where it tried to contact the First Polish Army under Soviet command, stationed on the right bank of Vistula. Since no help was forthcoming from the Soviet-controlled Poles, Mazurkiewicz and his unit made their way through Warsaw's sewers to Mokotów, the last center of resistance in Warsaw, in late September. There, the remains of the decimated group, including the Parasol and Czata 49 battalions, fought until the surrender of the Polish forces on 2 October. Shortly before the order was signed, Mazurkiewicz was officially promoted to the rank of colonel, by General Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski, the commander of the uprising.|$|E
5|$|Pneumonia, another {{potential}} complication, develops {{in as many}} as 20% of people with pulmonary contusion. Contused lungs are less able to remove bacteria than uninjured lungs, predisposing them to infection. Intubation and mechanical ventilation further increase the risk of developing pneumonia; the tube is passed through the nose or mouth into the airways, potentially tracking bacteria from the mouth or sinuses into them. Also, intubation prevents coughing, which would clear bacteria-laden secretions from the airways, and secretions pool near the tube's cuff and allow bacteria to grow. The sooner the endotracheal tube is removed, the lower the risk of pneumonia, but if it is removed too early and has to be <b>put</b> <b>back</b> <b>in,</b> the risk of pneumonia rises. People who are at risk for pulmonary aspiration (e.g. those with lowered level of consciousness due to head injuries) are especially likely to get pneumonia. As with ARDS, the chances of developing pneumonia increase with the size of the contusion. Children and adults have been found to have similar rates of complication with pneumonia and ARDS.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to Germany, Emden {{was assigned to}} training duties once again. She continued in this role until June 1942, by which time a major overhaul was in order. The refit was completed in Wilhelmshaven, after which Emden returned to training cadets. In September 1944, she was deployed to Norway, where she served as the flagship of the minelaying forces there. While in Norway, she participated in several minelaying operations through October, when she was transferred to convoy escort duty; her primary task was to protect convoys {{in and out of}} Oslo. This lasted until December, when she ran aground in the Oslofjord off the island of Flateguri. Her guns were removed while repairs were partially effected in the Schichau-Werke. Before departing East Prussia, she took on the remains of Paul von Hindenburg and his wife to carry them to mainland Germany. They had been disinterred to prevent them from falling {{into the hands of the}} advancing Soviet Army. The repair work on the ship was not yet completed, and so she was towed to Pillau, where the Hindenburgs' remains were taken off. Emdens engines were <b>put</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> working order, though she was incapable of reaching top speed, and her guns were reinstalled.|$|E
5|$|Next, a small {{metallic}} dingy, {{known as}} an iron yawl, was carried down to the beach. Tom Fagen and Freed Waterhouse manned the yawl, in another attempt to reach the grounded schooner. Through skilled seamanship, they {{made it to the}} second set of breakers, only a short distance from the vessel. When they tried to reach the float line, a large wave struck them leaving their boat filled with water. The two men abandoned their yawl. Fagen managed to swim ashore and was met by volunteers close to the beach half-drowned. Waterhouse decided against swimming to shore. When he saw that the yawl had flipped, he swam back to it and straddled the hull. The men on the shore began pulling the flipped boat in, but another wave broke on top of it throwing Waterhouse into the water and righting the yawl. Waterhouse climbed back into the boat and began getting pulled in again, only to be capsized shortly thereafter. This time Waterhouse surfaced, appearing dazed and grasping onto an oar. Shaw's rescue boat was <b>put</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the water, but Waterhouse had already gone under and presumably drowned to death a short time later. F Waterhouse's body was never recovered, despite several searches.|$|E

25|$|None of {{the toll}} road {{milestones}} are visible {{because they were}} buried during the Second World War {{to prevent them from}} being used by invading troops, agents, etc. This seems to have happened all over Scotland, however Fife was more fortunate than Ayrshire, for the stones were taken into storage and <b>put</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> place after the war had finished.

Hampshire were <b>put</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> to bat, and then famously scored a mammoth 521 before dismissing Warwickshire for 158 {{to win by}} a comfortable 155 runs.

25|$|Until 6 January 1929, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was a {{parliamentary}} monarchy.
