50|$|The Württemberg railway Commission Michael Knoll {{was charged}} with the {{planning}} {{and implementation of the}} construction of the railway link between Stuttgart and Ulm. Knoll and his colleague Karl Etzel constructed the Geislinger Steige and foresaw that all trains would have to be assisted by <b>pusher</b> <b>locomotives</b> up this five and a half kilometre-long ramp in order to climb the Swabian Jura (Schwäbische Alb). The railway needed a station as close as possible above the Steige for the uncoupling of the <b>pusher</b> <b>locomotives.</b> Knoll chose a location about one kilometre west of Amstetten. The village at that time was, with some 300 inhabitants, one of the smaller settlements in the Oberamt (district) of Geislingen.|$|R
50|$|On 29 June 1850, Royal Württemberg State Railways (Königlich Württembergische Staats-Eisenbahnen) {{opened the}} Geislingen-Ulm section. Amstetten station had two {{crossing}} tracks and a siding. A two-storey entrance building with arched {{windows on the}} ground floor faced the track towards Geislingen. It had a turntable and a shed for storing <b>pusher</b> <b>locomotives.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{system was}} {{technically}} successful, but {{the development of}} more powerful steam locomotives led to its abandonment from 3 July 1860, when steam locomotive ran throughout from Paris to St Germain, being assisted by a <b>pusher</b> <b>locomotive</b> up the gradient. This arrangement continued for more than sixty years until the electrification of the line.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotive}} shed {{was built in}} 1895 by the Royal Bavarian State Railways and extended in 1923 by the Deutsche Reichsbahn. Amongst others, <b>pusher</b> <b>locomotives</b> e. g. DRG Class 95s (ex-Prussian T 20s) and Class 96s (ex-Bavarian Gt 2x4/4 Mallet locomotives) were stationed there. One example of a Class 95 {{may be seen in}} the museum.|$|R
50|$|The {{reduction}} in the westbound ruling grades allowed the Canadian Pacific Railway to remove the <b>pusher</b> <b>locomotives</b> that had been required on the Connaught Tunnel route. This was especially important for the unit coal trains from the Crowsnest Pass area destined for Asian markets through the port of Vancouver, British Columbia. Trains now predominantly travel east through the Connaught Tunnel and west through the Mount Macdonald Tunnel.|$|R
50|$|In {{the era of}} steam, {{the ramp}} proved a real {{challenge}} for locomotives and crews. The majority of trains had to be reinforced by heavy <b>pusher</b> <b>locomotives.</b> These were stationed in the well-known locomotive depot at Neuenmarkt-Wirsberg. They included famous locomotives such as the DRG Class 95 (ex-Prussian T 20) and DRG Class 96 (ex-Bavarian Gt 2x4/4), as well as DRG Classes 57 (ex-Prussian G 10) and 50.|$|R

5000|$|A Class 9E or Class 15E {{electric}} locomotive {{serves as the}} master of each mixed electric and diesel-electric consist, {{with a total of}} between eight and twelve locomotives per train, depending on the locomotive types involved and with twelve being the maximum number allowed. Motive power usually consists of three sets of locomotives and a lone {{electric locomotive}} pushing at the rear end of the train. Each locomotive set usually consists of one Class 9E or 15E electric and one or two Class 34 or 43-000 diesel-electric locomotives, with each set’s electric locomotive controlling its respective diesel-electric companions by means of a [...] (smart cable). In effect, each ore train is therefore made up of three separate 114-wagon trains consisted together, with the locomotives of all three trains and the <b>pusher</b> <b>locomotive</b> at the rear end all controlled by means of a Locotrol radio distributed power control system by one crew in the leading electric locomotive. A typical train would therefore be made up of locomotive set A, 114 wagons, locomotive set B, 114 wagons, locomotive set C, 114 wagons, and the <b>pusher</b> <b>locomotive.</b>|$|E
50|$|Since {{it was not}} {{possible}} to remotely control a steam locomotive, each helper had to have a full crew on board. Careful coordination was required between engine crews to assure that all locomotives were operated in a consistent manner. Standard whistle signals were employed to tell the helper crew when to apply power, drift or brake. A misunderstanding of signals by a <b>pusher</b> <b>locomotive</b> crew could result in a major wreck if the lead locomotive applied brakes while the bank engine was still applying power. The usual result was that the train would experience a violent run-in (an abrupt bunching of train slack), resulting in the derailment of part or all of the train.|$|E
50|$|The chute can be {{adjusted}} to throw the snow to either the left or {{the right side of}} the tracks. An operator sits in a cab just above and behind the blade assembly to control the speed of the blades and the direction of output from the chute. With the increasing prevalence of diesel locomotives, multiple-unit train controls have been added to the cabs, so that the <b>pushing</b> <b>locomotives</b> can be controlled from the plow.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{train control}} systems use {{sophisticated}} electronics to allow full remote control of locomotives. Nevertheless, push-pull operation still requires considerable design care {{to ensure that}} control system failure does not endanger passengers and also to ensure that, {{in the event of}} a derailment, the <b>pushing</b> <b>locomotive</b> does not <b>push</b> a derailed train into an obstacle worsening the accident. The 1984 Polmont rail crash (in Scotland) occurred when a push-pull train struck a cow on the track.|$|R

50|$|The {{locomotives}} {{were developed}} specially for the steep ramps in the K.Bay.Sts.B.'s territory: the railway line from Sonneberg-Probstzella, the Spessart ramp, the Franconian Forest Railway (Frankenwaldbahn), the Schiefe Ebene (lit: inclined plane), {{and the line}} from Eger to Asch (today Cheb-Aš). Its Mallet design at this size proved to have good traction and curve running on the tight mountain bends. The first test journey in 1914 {{took place on the}} route from Lichtenfels-Rothenkirchen. It was worth being able to mount the steep ramps in a much shorter time in order for the lines to generate a profit. In this role she was able to provide good service for up to 30 years and more, especially as a <b>pusher</b> <b>locomotive,</b> but also as the motive power for goods and passenger trains and reduced journey times by around 40%. The Mallet could manage an incline of 25‰ at 25 km/h hauling 465 tons, and could achieve a maximum of 40 km/h with lighter trains.|$|E
50|$|The {{section to}} the Hornberg Lime Works is still worked by goods trains. These trains, {{with a maximum}} of 600 tonnes of towing {{capacity}} uphill and 1,500 tonnes downhill are each hauled by a train locomotive and a <b>pusher</b> <b>locomotive</b> which avoids a backshunt at Michaelstein station. In 2005 current to the catenary was switched off. On 12 July 2005 the section from Blankenburg to Elbingerode was put out to tender by DB Netz AG. Passenger services were cancelled {{by the state of}} Saxony-Anhalt on 11 December 2005 on the last remaining still operational section between Blankenburg and Elbingerode. On 1 May 2006 the Fels-Werke company leased the line with an option to purchase. The DB Netz AG handed the line over in working condition to the new operator, Fels Netz GmbH. From that point the Havelländische Eisenbahn (HVLE), who had already paid for most of the goods traffic since 2005, took over the remaining transport operations previously run by Railion. Currently the route is operated by dispatchers (Zugleitbetrieb)(as at 2009). Since 2003 it has been upgraded at a cost of 2.4 million euros, of which 800,000 euros were funded by the state.|$|E
50|$|In 1933 the Garmisch-Murnau {{line was}} {{reclassified}} {{as a main}} line. The line had to be upgraded for the 1936 Winter Olympics {{to be held in}} Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Since the Murnau-Garmisch section was built as a local railway, it needed to be upgraded {{in a short period of}} time. The section had especially sharp bends and weak bridges. There were more problems on the Hechendorf-Murnau section, including a 2.6% grade, which sometimes required trains had to be so assisted by pusher locomotives. This involved complex movements with the <b>pusher</b> <b>locomotive</b> having to return to the bottom of the steep section on the single track section.For these reasons, on 26 and 27 March 1935 the management board of Deutsche Reichsbahn (German Railways) agreed to the duplication of the Huglfing-Hechendorf section. The upgrade would need to be completed by the beginning of winter 1935 in order to be ready for the 1936 Winter Olympics. In addition to the second track, the original track has been improved, curves had to be widened and the stations at Huglfing, Uffing, Murnau and Hechendorf had to be upgraded considerably. On 18 December 1935 the upgraded section was put back into service, although this required large structures such as a six-metre-high bridge over Highway 2 and the reconstruction of the bridge where the Oberammergau line crosses the line in Murnau. The second track in the Huglfing-Murnau section was dismantled in 1942 and 1943 as a result of the war. Ballast and sleepers from the line were used in the conversion of the Oberammergau line to the standard German electrical system in 1954. The Murnau-Hechendorf section is still operated as two lines. The upgrading of the line in 1935 increased the line speed between Tutzing and Murnau from 80 to 110 km/h and between Murnau and Garmisch-Partenkirchen from 55 to 80 km/h.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{operation}} of trains through the difficult terrain between Großschwabhausen and Jena West was difficult, especially {{in the early years}} of the Weimar-Gera line, it was necessary to use <b>pusher</b> <b>locomotives</b> to provide assistance. A shed was built at the station with accommodation for two pusher engines. Around 1926 the engine shed was closed down because the power of locomotives had increased significantly. It has since accommodated other activities, including a gymnasium. It is now used as a club and as the home of various cultural activities.|$|R

50|$|With all six {{cylinders}} {{operating at}} their full pressure (which {{could not be}} sustained for very long), the Triplexes produced huge amounts of tractive effort (TE) {{that may have been}} the highest of any steam locomotives before or since. (Westing gives a figure of 160000 lbf kN in compound mode and seems to indicate that it was the largest TE for any locomotive up to the time 1914-1916.) The Triplexes could also be considered the largest tank engines ever built since the tender had driving wheels as well and thus contributed to traction. The problem of variable adhesion on the tender unit was not a serious one, since <b>pusher</b> <b>locomotives</b> had frequent opportunities to take on additional fuel and water. In total, only four Triplexes came into existence and only in the United States; all were retired by 1930; none were preserved.|$|R

50|$|The most {{successful}} armoured train {{was a single}} car built to defend the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad. The railroad had been attacked by southern forces to prevent transport of Union soldiers to the front; and snipers were discouraging men attempting to repair the damage. Baldwin Locomotive Works modified a baggage car in late April, 1861. A 24-pounder howitzer was placed on a swivel mount {{at the opposite end}} of the car from the <b>pushing</b> <b>locomotive.</b> The sides of the car were sheathed with 2.5 inch cm oak planks covered with 0.5 inch cm boiler plate. The end of the car around the howitzer was fitted with hinged 2 ft panels which could be temporarily lifted to aim and fire the howitzer and then lowered to protect the crew of six men loading the howitzer with grapeshot or canister shot. The remainder of the car contained fifty ports for riflemen. The car was effective for its original purpose, but vulnerability to artillery rendered such cars of comparatively little use during later stages of the war. In August, 1864, a Confederate raiding party disabled a Baltimore and Ohio Railroad <b>locomotive</b> <b>pushing</b> an armoured train; and then piled ties around the armoured car and set them afire.|$|R
5000|$|Beginning in 1915, the Southern had {{the unique}} idea to fit [...] "tractor engines" [...] {{underneath}} the tender. These locomotives were {{used on the}} mountainous Asheville Division in North Carolina. They were similar to the Erie Railroad's [...] "Triplex" [...] 2-8-8-8-2 <b>pusher</b> <b>locomotives,</b> in that the rear set of driving wheels exhausted through a pipe on {{the rear of the}} tender. But there was not just one specific type of wheel arrangement. The Southern added 2-8-0 engines onto the Mikados 4535-4539 and 4576, but they added a 2-6-0 unit to the 4561. They did not produce good enough results, and the tractor units were removed in 1924 and were replaced by standard tenders. An obvious problem with this arrangement is that, similar to the Garratt locomotive and the Triplex, as the tender coal and water ran out, the traction decreased. The locomotives continued service until the early 1950s.|$|R
