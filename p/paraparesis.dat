5|$|Hepatitis viruses {{can develop}} into a chronic viral {{infection}} that leads to liver cancer. Infection by human T-lymphotropic virus can lead to tropical spastic <b>paraparesis</b> and adult T-cell leukaemia. Human papillomaviruses are an established cause of cancers of cervix, skin, anus, and penis. Within the Herpesviridae, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus causes Kaposi's sarcoma and body-cavity lymphoma, and Epstein–Barr virus causes Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, B lymphoproliferative disorder, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Merkel cell polyomavirus closely related to SV40 and mouse polyomaviruses {{that have been used}} as animal models for cancer viruses for over 50 years.|$|E
5|$|The first {{symptoms}} of Guillain–Barré syndrome are numbness, tingling, and pain, {{alone or in}} combination. This is followed by weakness of the legs and arms that affects both sides equally and worsens over time. The weakness can take half a day to over two weeks to reach maximum severity, and then becomes steady. In one in five people, the weakness continues to progress {{for as long as}} four weeks. The muscles of the neck may also be affected, and about half experience involvement of the cranial nerves which supply the head and face; this may lead to weakness of the muscles of the face, swallowing difficulties and sometimes weakness of the eye muscles. In 8%, the weakness affects only the legs (paraplegia or <b>paraparesis).</b> Involvement of the muscles that control the bladder and anus is unusual. In total, about a third of people with Guillain–Barré syndrome continue to be able to walk. Once the weakness has stopped progressing, it persists at a stable level ("plateau phase") before improvement occurs. The plateau phase can take between two days and six months, but the most common duration is a week. Pain-related symptoms affect more than half, and include back pain, painful tingling, muscle pain and pain {{in the head and neck}} relating to irritation of the lining of the brain.|$|E
25|$|ADEM has {{an abrupt}} onset and a {{monophasic}} course. Symptoms usually begin 1–3 weeks after infection. Major symptoms include fever, headache, nausea and vomiting, confusion, vision impairment, drowsiness, seizures and coma. Although initially {{the symptoms are}} usually mild, they worsen rapidly {{over the course of}} hours to days, with the average time to maximum severity being about four and a half days. Additional symptoms include hemiparesis, <b>paraparesis,</b> and cranial nerve palsies.|$|E
25|$|Both {{the central}} nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and the {{peripheral}} nervous system may be involved. Emboli to the brain may cause stroke-like episodes, headache and episodes of loss of vision in one eye (known as amaurosis fugax). Emboli to the eye can be seen by ophthalmoscopy and are known as plaques of Hollenhorst. Emboli to the spinal cord may cause <b>paraparesis</b> (decreased power in the legs) or cauda equina syndrome, a group of symptoms due to loss of function of the distal part of the spinal cord - loss of control over the bladder, rectum and skin sensation around the anus. If the blood supply to a single nerve is interrupted by an embolus, the result is loss of function in the muscles supplied by that nerve; this phenomenon is called a mononeuropathy.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{symptoms}} of Devic's disease are {{loss of vision}} and spinal cord function. [...] Optic neuritis may manifest as visual impairment with decreased visual acuity, although visual field defects, or loss of color vision may occur in isolation or prior to formal loss of acuity. [...] Spinal cord dysfunction can lead to muscle weakness, reduced sensation, or loss of bladder and bowel control. [...] The typical patient has an acute and severe spastic weakness of the legs (<b>paraparesis)</b> or all four limbs (quadriparesis) with sensory signs, often accompanied by loss of bladder control.|$|E
2500|$|Degenerative {{myelopathy}} (DM) is {{a neurological}} {{disease of the}} spinal cord causing progressive <b>paraparesis,</b> most commonly in the German shepherd dog breed. It affects Rhodesian ridgebacks {{at a rate of}} only 0.75%. Signs of degenerative myelopathy are characterized at the beginning with foot dragging, and slipping of the rear limbs. The disease progresses {{to the point where the}} animal can no longer stand or walk on its own. Progression has been known to take as little as six months, or several years. There is a [...] offered by the Orthopedic Foundation of Animals, to test for the gene. Animals who are at risk for the disease should not be bred to other animals at risk, as this creates future generations of this debilitating disease.|$|E
2500|$|ALD {{can present}} in {{different}} ways. The different presentations are {{complicated by the}} pattern of X-linked recessive inheritance. There have been seven phenotypes described in males with ABCD1 mutations and five in females. [...] Initial symptoms in boys affected with the childhood cerebral form of ALD include emotional instability, hyperactivity and disruptive behavior at school. Older patients affected with the cerebral form will present with similar symptoms. [...] Untreated, cerebral ALD is characterized by progressive demyelination leading to a vegetative state and death. [...] Adult males with an adrenomyeloneuropathy presentation typically present initially with muscle stiffness, <b>paraparesis</b> and sexual dysfunction. [...] All patients with clinically recognized ALD phenotypes {{are at risk for}} adrenal insufficiency. [...] There is no reliable way to predict which form of the disease an affected individual will develop, with multiple phenotypes being demonstrated within families. [...] Onset of adrenal insufficiency is often the first symptom, appearing as early as two years of age.|$|E
2500|$|In more detail, it is a {{disorder}} of peroxisomal fatty acid beta oxidation {{which results in}} the accumulation of very long chain fatty acids in tissues throughout the body. [...] The most severely affected tissues are the myelin in the central nervous system, the adrenal cortex, and the Leydig cells in the testes. [...] Clinically, ALD is a heterogeneous disorder, presenting with several distinct phenotypes, and no clear pattern of genotype-phenotype correlation. [...] As an X-linked disorder, ALD presents most commonly in males, however approximately 50% of heterozygote females show some symptoms later in life. [...] Approximately two-thirds of ALD patients will present with the childhood cerebral form of the disease, {{which is the most}} severe form. [...] It is characterized by normal development in early childhood, followed by rapid degeneration to a vegetative state. [...] The other forms of ALD vary in terms of onset and clinical severity, ranging from adrenal insufficiency to progressive <b>paraparesis</b> in early adulthood (this form of the disease is typically known as adrenomyeloneuropathy).|$|E
50|$|Tropical spastic <b>paraparesis</b> (TSP), {{also called}} HTLV-I-associated {{myelopathy}} (HAM) or HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic <b>paraparesis</b> (HAM/TSP) {{is a medical}} condition that causes weakness, muscle spasms, and sensory disturbance by human T-lymphotropic virus resulting in <b>paraparesis,</b> weakness of the legs. As the name suggests, it is most common in tropical regions, including the Caribbean. Blood transfusion products are screened for HTLV-1 antibodies, as a preventive measure.|$|E

50|$|In {{complicated}} {{cases of}} autosomal dominant optic atrophy, {{in addition to}} bilateral optic neuropathy, several other neurological signs of neurological involvement can be observed: peripheral neuropathy, deafness, cerebellar ataxia, spastic <b>paraparesis,</b> myopathy.|$|E
50|$|The {{prognosis}} for Tropical spastic <b>paraparesis</b> indicates some improvement in {{a percentage of}} cases due to immunosuppressive treatment. A higher percentage will eventually lose the ability to walk within a ten-year interval.|$|E
50|$|Initially, most {{patients}} experience generalized weakness {{during the first}} days and are bedridden for some days or weeks before trying to walk. Occasional blurred vision and/or speech difficulties typically clear during the first month, except in severely affected patients. Spasticity is present from the first day, without any initial phase of flaccidity. After the initial weeks of functional improvement, the spastic <b>paraparesis</b> remains stable {{for the rest of}} life. Some patients may suffer an abrupt aggravating episode, e.g. a sudden and permanent worsening of the spastic <b>paraparesis.</b> Such episodes are identical to the initial onset and can therefore be interpreted as a second onset.|$|E
50|$|In Tropical spastic <b>paraparesis,</b> HTLV-1 shows {{elevated}} cellular acquired {{immune response}} {{as well as}} high production of proinflammatory cytokines. IFN overexpression has been demonstrated as well. Also the number of NK cells (CD56+ and CD16+) is diminished.|$|E
5000|$|DRB1*0101 is {{associated}} with rheumatoid arthritis, in anti-Jk(a) mediated hemolytic transfusion reactions, foliaceous pemphigus, HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic <b>paraparesis,</b> and [...] lichen planus. In lyme disease arthritis, *0101 appears {{to play a role}} inpresentation of triggering microbial antigens.|$|E
50|$|Tropical myeloneuropathies are {{classified}} as two separate syndromes: tropical ataxic neuropathy (TAN) and tropical spastic <b>paraparesis</b> (TSP). They are placed together because they are found in tropical countries, although tropical spastic paraparesishas occurred in temperate countries (e.g., Japan).|$|E
5000|$|Surfer's {{myelopathy}} {{is a rare}} nontraumatic <b>paraparesis.</b> It is {{a spinal}} cord injury caused by hyperextension of the back. When the back is hyperextended, a blood vessel leading to the spine can become kinked, depriving the spinal cord of oxygen ...|$|E
50|$|Treatment of TSP {{involves}} corticosteroids to {{help with}} inflammation. Though any success with corticosteroids is short-lived, with symptoms worsened as the dosage is reduced. A synthetic derivative, 17-alpha-ethinyltestosterone, {{can be used to}} treat Tropical spastic <b>paraparesis,</b> improvement in motor and bladder function was reported but not sustainable.|$|E
50|$|The {{onset of}} {{paralysis}} (spastic <b>paraparesis)</b> is sudden and symmetrical and affects the legs {{more than the}} arms. The resulting disability is permanent but does not progress. Typically, a patient is standing and walking {{on the balls of}} the feet with rigid legs and often with ankle clonus.|$|E
50|$|Manni {{was born}} in Lahti, Finland in 1992. He was born with <b>paraparesis</b> which saw his ability to walk unaided {{deteriorated}} from a young age. He obtained a degree in physical education from Pajulahti Sports Institute in Nastola. His younger brother Tuomas is also a para-athlete, competing in triathlon events.|$|E
5000|$|In {{cases of}} {{obstructed}} {{flow in the}} Heubner's artery, the individual may experience infarction in those subcortical areas and thus hemiparesis. More proximal portions of the medial striate artery may cause spastic <b>paraparesis</b> and sensory loss contralateral to the lesioned side. Urinary incontinence and gait apraxia are also not uncommon findings.|$|E
50|$|It {{should be}} noted that tapioca starch is made from cassava root. If {{prepared}} incorrectly, cassava root can be highly toxic as it naturally contains linamarin, a cyanogenic glycoside, which upon ingestion will release cyanide in the gut. Prolonged ingestion can result in acute cyanide poisoning, a goiter, spastic <b>paraparesis,</b> or ataxic neuropathy.|$|E
5000|$|... α-internexin {{has also}} been implicated in several {{degenerative}} diseases such as Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson’s Disease, neuropathies, tropical spastic <b>paraparesis</b> and HTLV-1 associated myelopathy. In HTLV-1 myelopathy, Tax, transactivator expressed by HTLV-1, interacts with α-internexin in cell culture resulting in dramatic reduction in Tax transcactivation and intermediate filament formation.|$|E
50|$|HTLV-1 is also {{associated}} with a progressive demyelinating upper motor neuron disease known as HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic <b>paraparesis</b> (HAM/TSP), an characterized by sensory and motor deficits, particularly of the lower extremities, incontinence and impotence.

50|$|Persons with HDLS {{can suffer}} from tremors, {{decreased}} body movement, unsteadiness (Parkinsonism, muscles {{on one side}} of the body in constant contraction (spastic hemiparesis), impairment in motor and sensory function in the lower extremities (<b>paraparesis),</b> paralysis resulting in partial or total loss of all extremities and torso (tetraparesis), and the lack of voluntary coordination of muscle movements (ataxia).|$|E
50|$|Clinical {{features}} include <b>paraparesis</b> or quadriparesis (depending {{on the level}} of the injury) and impaired pain and temperature sensation. Complete motor paralysis below the level of the lesion due to interruption of the corticospinal tract, and loss of pain and temperature sensation at and below the level of the lesion. Proprioception and vibratory sensation is preserved, {{as it is in the}} dorsal side of the spinal cord.|$|E
50|$|Mogamulizumab, an anti-CCR4 IgG1 {{monoclonal}} antibody, is {{also being}} researched as a possible treatment for Tropical spastic <b>paraparesis.</b> The antibody reduces HTLV-1 proviral load and production of proinflammatory cytokines. Valproic acid has also succeeded in reducing the proviral load of HTLV-1 (though clinical benefits were minimal or none).
