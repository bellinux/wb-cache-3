Under the optimal conditions, the recoveries of PCNs, HBCDs and TBBPA in different fractions were determined with liquid/gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC or GC-MS/MS), which was nearly close to 100 %. To investigate the feasibility of the developed method, it was applied to isolate target compounds from spiked soil extracts. PCNs, HBCDs and TBBPA could be subsequently eluted with hexane, hexane/dichloromethane (1 : 1), and hexane/dichloromethane (1 : 3), and the recoveries of the analysts from three fractions were satisfactory (70. 9 %- 107 %) {{with the exception of}} gamma-HBCD at low levels.

40|$|Nine typical waste incinerating {{plants were}} {{investigated}} for <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>naphthalene</b> (PCN) contents in their stack gas. The incinerators investigated include those used to incinerate municipal solid, aviation, medical, and hazardous wastes including those encountered in cement kilns. PCNs were qualified and quantified by isotope dilution high resolution gas chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry techniques.

40|$|The {{emission}} factors (EFs) for a {{broad range}} of semivolatile organic chemicals (SVOCs) from subtropical eucalypt forest and tropical savannah fires were determined for the first time from in situ investigations. Significantly higher (t test, P < 0. 01) EFs (mu g kg(- 1) dry fuel, gas + particle-associated) for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Sigma(13) PAHs) were determined from the subtropical forest fire (7, 000 +/- 170) compared to the tropical savannah fires (1, 600 +/- 110), due to the approximately 60 -fold higher EFs for 3 -ring PAHs from the former. EF data for many PAHs from the eucalypt forest fire were comparable with those previously reported from pine and fir forest combustion events. EFs for other SVOCs including polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>naphthalene</b> (PCN), and polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners as well as some pesticides (e. g., permethrin) were determined from the subtropical eucalypt forest fire.

40|$|<b>Polychlorinated</b> <b>naphthalene</b> (PCN) {{concentrations}} and fluxes {{were measured}} in a dated core from the profundal sediments of Esthwaite Water, a seasonally anoxic semirural lake in northwest England. The vertical profile {{shows that the}} ΣPCN flux remained fairly constant at 0. 4 − 0. 6 μg m- 2 y- 1 from depth until the early 1940 s, escalating sharply thereafter to a subsurface maximum of 12 μg m- 2 y- 1 in the late 1950 s to mid- 1960 s followed by a 4 -fold decrease to the sediment−water interface. The ΣPCN maximum predates the ΣPCB maximum by 20 years, broadly consistent with the time lapse in the production and wide use of both compounds. Furthermore, there was a secondary peak in the profiles of both compound classes corresponding to the period of maximum input of the other compound class.

40|$|Capillary gas {{chromatography}} (GC) {{is a very}} useful technique for the determination of complex mixtures of halogenated contaminants. Initially, this technique has shown its merits for the determination of polychlorinated biphenyls and organochlorine pesticides. In addition, it has also broken new grounds towards the identification and quantification of relatively unknown halogenated compounds, often complex mixtures, such as toxaphene, <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>naphthalenes</b> and paraffins and brominated flame retardants. Capillary GC is, however, not the final solution for the determination of all these mixtures. For some of them, with a relatively simple constitution or {{with only a few}} major components, such as chlordanes and brominated diphenylethers, a reliable congener-specific analysis may be carried out by single-column capillary GC. For others more advanced techniques will be required. Multi-dimensional (MD) GC techniques, such as heart-cut MDGC or comprehensive MDGC, are still under development or have only been applied for non-routine analyses. Given the importance of some of these complex mixtures, such as several brominated flame retardants, which are still produced and used daily and world-wide, it may be expected that next to the use of GC-MS, these more advanced GC techniques will be used more frequently in the near future. The current state-of-the-art of capillary GC with regard to the different compounds classes indicated below is described. Also, attention is given to the sample preparation. The following groups of contaminants are being discussed: polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans, chlorinated bornanes (toxaphene), chlordane, polychlorinated terphenyls, <b>polychlorinated</b> diphenylethers, <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>naphthalenes,</b> <b>polychlorinated</b> alkanes, polybrominated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenylethers.

The stepwise multiple linear regression was used to derive six equations with correlation coefficients greater than 0. 99 except for PBDEs' (0. 96).

40|$|Thermal {{experiments}} (at 250 - 450 degrees C for 10 - 240 min) on fly ash from secondary copper smelting process (SeCu) {{were performed}} to study the <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>naphthalene</b> (PCN) formation in the post-zone of a secondary copper smelter. Unexpectedly high concentrations of PCNs were formed. Total PCN concentrations and toxic equivalents were 47 - 104 and 44 - 80 {{times higher than the}} initial concentration and toxic equivalent, respectively. The thermal disposal of SeCu fly ash should therefore be reconsidered. The kinetic of each homolog was determined under different thermal conditions. Less chlorinated homologs favored 350 degrees C and more chlorinated homologs favored higher temperature. Most of the homologs reached an equilibrium of formation and degradation within 30 mm, except octachloronaphthalene which did not appear to reach such an equilibrium even after 240 mm. Chlorine substitution of the formed PCNs was identified and a similar pattern was found in chlorination products starting with naphthalene and chlorine. Furthermore, inorganic chlorine and unsubstituted naphthalene were found in the reaction products, confirming that the formation of naphthalene and the chlorination of that naphthalene could occur and could be suggested to be an important PCN formation route. A detailed formation pathway from naphthalene through octachloronaphthalene is proposed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Pilot {{studies of}} unintentionally {{produced}} pollutants {{should be performed}} before waste being co-processed in cement kilns. <b>Polychlorinated</b> <b>naphthalene</b> (PCN) formation and emission from cement kilns co-processing sorted municipal solid waste, sewage sludge, and waste acid, however, have not previously been studied. Here, PCNs were analyzed in stack gas samples and solid samples from different stages of three cement production runs. PCN destruction efficiencies were higher when waste was co-processed (93. 1 % and 88. 7 % in two tests) than when waste was not co-processed (39. 1 %), so co-processing waste would not increase PCN outputs. The PCN concentrations were higher in particle samples from the Cl preheater and stages at back end of kiln than in particle samples from other stages, suggesting that cyclone preheater and back end of kiln should be focused for controlling PCN emissions. Besides that, based on the variation of PCN concentrations and corresponding operating conditions in different stages, the temperature, feeding materials, and chlorine content were suggested as the main factors influencing PCN formation. The PCN homologue and congener profiles suggested chlorination and dechlorination were the main PCN formation and decomposition pathways, and congeners CN- 23, CN- 46, and CN- 59 appear to be appropriate indicators of PCNs emitted from coal-burning sources.

We collected 6 stack gas samples from the MSWI and 21 soil samples from sampling sites at distances of between 300 and 1700 m from the MSWI stack. Total dI-PCN (dioxin-like PCN) concentrations in the stack gas samples ranged from 6898 and 89, 032 pg m(- 3), with a mean value of 36, 241 pg mg(- 3). The total dI-PCN concentrations in the soil samples ranged from 30. 35 to 280. 9 pg g(- 1) it with a mean value of 87. 03 and a median value of 70. 32 pg g(- 1), while the TEQvalues were between 7. 7 and 1302 fg TEQg(- 1), with a mean value of 41. 12 fg TEQg(- 1) and a median value of 31. 52 fg TEQg(- 1). The PCN homologue patterns {{and the results of}} Principal Component Analysis suggested that the MSWI may be a source of PCNs in the soils. A contour map, created using an ordinary Kriging interpolation technique, showed that a limited area (<= 1000 m radius) surrounding the MSWI was influenced by the emissions from the MSWI. Furthermore, an exponential function equation was proposed to quantify the relationship between TEQs of PCNs and the distance from the stack. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbon (PAH) formation and growth from cyclopentadiene (CPD) moieties {{have been investigated}} using a laminar flow reactor and molecular modeling. The resonance-stabilized cyclopentadienyl radical is readily formed in flames and can participate in PAH growth to soot by reaction with the ??onds of aromatic species. Both CPD pyrolysis and computational results indicate that formation of indene and benzene is favored at low temperatures (below 750 oC) and formation of naphthalene is favored at high temperatures. Reaction pathways from CPD have further been extended to PAH formation from the reaction of CPD and aromatic compounds with different types of ??onds. Results indicate that, while the major products from the pyrolysis of CPD, acenaphthylene, styrene and phenanthrene mixtures are from the reaction of CPD to itself rather than to these aromatic compounds with different ??onds, CPD does add to these compounds to produce larger PAH. <b>Polychlorinated</b> <b>naphthalene</b> (PCN) formation from chlorinated phenols has also been studied. In combustion exhaust gas, chlorinated phenols can produce dioxin as well as PCNs. PCN and polychlorinated dibenzofuran (PCDF) congener product distributions were consistent with proposed pathways involving phenoxy radical coupling at unchlorinated ortho-carbon sites. Tautomerization of the phenoxy radical coupling and subsequent fusion via H 2 O loss results in PCDF formation. Competing with this reaction pathway, CO elimination and subsequent fusion via hydrogen and/or chlorine loss was found to produce PCNs. PCDF isomer distributions {{were found to be}} weakly dependent to temperature, whereas PCN isomer distributions were found to be more temperature sensitive with selectivity to particular isomers decreasing with increasing temperature.

40|$|Cement kilns {{can be used}} to co-process fly ash from {{municipal}} solid waste incinerators. However, this might increase emission of organic pollutants like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Knowledge of PCB concentrations and homolog and congener patterns at different stages in this process could be used to assess the possibility of simultaneously controlling emissions of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and "dioxin-like" compounds. To date, emissions from cement kilns co-processing fly ash from {{municipal solid}} waste incinerators have not been analyzed for PCBs. In this study, stack gas and particulate samples from two cement kilns co-processing waste incinerator fly ash were analyzed for PCBs. The average total tri- to deca-chlorinated biphenyl (Sigma 3 - 10 PCB) concentration in the stack gas samples was 10. 15 ng m(- 3). The Sigma 3 - 10 PCB concentration ranges in particulate samples from different stages were 0. 83 - 41. 79 ng g(- 1) for cement kiln 1 and 0. 13 - 1. 69 ng g(- 1) for cement kiln 2. The Sigma 3 - 10 PCB concentrations were much higher in particulate samples from the suspension pre-heater boiler, humidifier tower, and kiln back-end bag filters than in particulate samples from other stages. For these three stages, PCBs contributed to 15 - 18 % of the total PCB, PCDD/F, and <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>naphthalene</b> toxic equivalents in stack gases and particulate matter. The PCB distributions were similar to those found in other studies for PCDD/Fs and polychlorinated naphthalenes, which suggest that {{it may be possible to}} simultaneously control emissions of multiple organic pollutants from cement kilns. Homolog patterns in the particulate samples were dominated by the pentachlorobiphenyls. CB- 105, CB- 118, and CB- 123 were the dominant dioxin-like PCB congeners that formed at the back-end of the cement kiln. A mass balance of PCBs in the cement kilns indicated that the total mass of PCBs in the stack gases and clinker was about half the mass of PCBs in the raw materials. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

PCN concentration of these air samples ranged from 0. 033 to 2. 56 pg m(- 3), {{with an average of}} 0. 518 pg m(- 3), equal to or lower than the values reported for other oceans, seas, and lakes worldwide. Tri- and tetra-CNs were the main homologues in most samples. Remission of Halowax mixtures and incineration processes were the major sources of atmospheric PCNs in the study area. The PCN-corresponding toxic equivalency values ranged from 0 to 0. 190 fg m(- 3) (average: 0. 038 fg m(- 3)), falling in the low end of global range. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Embryotoxicity {{of several}} {{persistent}} organic polutants (POPs) is documented from laboratory experiments and field studies. However, biochemical and cellular events {{involved in the}} POPs-induced effects (e. g. changes in retinoid concentrations) are not characterized in details. In the present study we introduce a novel in vitro bioassay with embryonal P 19 cells (clone P 19 /A 15) stably transfected with firefly luciferase gene under control of RARE (Retinoic Acid Responsive Element). Expression of the reporter luciferase activity is induced after exposure of the cells to retinoic acid (ATRA; 10 - 9 mol. l- 1 concentrations). Simultaneous treatments by ATRA (20 nM) and picomolar concentrations of 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) resulted in the substantial decrease of luciferase activity indicating selective disruption of retinoid signalling. Additional experiments with DELOR 106 (commercial mixture of polychlorinated biphenyls, PCBs) and Nibrenwax (mixture of <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>naphthalenes,</b> PCNs) reveal a suitability of the bioassay for rapid screening and detection of xenobiotic-induced biochemical effects directly related to cellular differentiation, embryotoxicity and developmental toxicity...|$|R
40|$|Field {{monitoring}} {{was conducted}} to update and develop unintentional persistent organic pollutant (unintentional POP) emission inventories for the copper metallurgy industry in China. In this study, emissions of six unintentional POPs comprised of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin and dibenzofuran (PCDD/PCDF), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>naphthalenes</b> (PCNs), hexachlorobenzene (HxCBz) and pentachlorobenzene (PeCBz) in stack gas and fly ash samples from primary and secondary copper smelters using different raw materials and technologies were measured and compared. Different concentrations, congener patterns and emission factors of unintentional POPs among four copper smelters were observed. Variations in unintentional POP emissions from several areas of a primary copper smelter were also investigated. The total emissions of unintentional POPs from primary and secondary copper production in 2010 in China were estimated respectively. These results provide a useful reference {{for the establishment of}} unintentional POP emission inventories and for policymakers to formulate control strategies to reduce unintentional POPs resulting from copper metallurgy.

40|$|Unintentionally {{produced}} persistent {{organic pollutants}} (UP-POPs) were determined in ambient air from around five secondary non-ferrous metal processing plants in China, to investigate the potential impacts of the emissions of these plants on their surrounding environments. The target compounds were polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (dl-PCBs), and <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>naphthalenes</b> (PCNs). The PCDD/F, dl-PCB, and PCN concentrations in the ambient air downwind of the plants were 4. 70 - 178, 8. 23 - 7520 and 152 - 4190 pg/m(3), respectively, and the concentrations upwind of the plants were lower. Clear correlations were found between ambient air and stack gas concentrations of the PCDD/Fs, dl-PCBs, and PCNs among the five plants, respectively. Furthermore, the UP-POPs homolog and congener patterns in the ambient air were similar to the patterns in the stack gas samples. These results indicate that UP-POPs emissions from the plants investigated have obvious impacts on the environments surrounding the plants. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
