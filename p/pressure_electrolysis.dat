50|$|Intensification of {{technological}} processes and chemical reactions is achieved due to intensive mixing and dispersion, acoustic and electromagnetic treatment, high local <b>pressure</b> and <b>electrolysis</b> of processed components. Electromagnetic devices with a vortex layer with ferromagnetic elements accelerate the reactions 1.5-2 times; reduce {{the consumption of}} reagents and electricity by 20%. The grinding effect is achieved by the motion of ferromagnetic particles and their free collision with each other, and a constrained collision between the particles and a body. The degree of grinding is 0.5 μm (with an initial size of 20 mm).At present, the electromagnetic devices with a vortex layer with ferromagnetic elements actually exist (D.D. Logvinenko himself designed and produced more than 2000 pieces), their principle is also implemented in some technological lines.|$|R
40|$|Oxygen (O 2) is {{obviously}} essential for human space missions, {{but it is}} important to examine all the different ways it will be used and the potential sources that it may come from. This effort will lead to storage and delivery requirements and help to determine the optimum architecture from an overall systems engineering point of view. Accounting for all the oxygen in a Lunar Outpost mission includes meeting the metabolic needs of the crew while in the surface Habitat, leakage through the Habitat or Pressurized Rover walls, recharge of the space suit backpack and emergency situations. Current plans indicate that both primary and secondary O 2 bottles for the space suit will be filled to a pressure of 20. 7 MPa (3000 psia). Other uses of O 2 require much lower pressure. Sources of O 2 at a Lunar Outpost include compressed or liquefied O 2 brought along specifically for life support, scavenged O 2 from the Lander propulsion system, recovered O 2 from waste water or exhaled carbon dioxide and O 2 mined from the moon itself. Previously, eight technology options were investigated to provide the high pressure space suit O 2. High pressure O 2 storage was treated as the baseline technology and compared to the other seven. The other seven were cryogenic storage followed by high pressure vaporization, scavenging liquid oxygen (LOX) from Lander followed by vaporization, LOX delivery followed by sorption compression, low <b>pressure</b> water <b>electrolysis</b> followed by mechanical compression, high <b>pressure</b> water <b>electrolysis,</b> sharing a high pressure electrolyzer with a regenerative fuel cell power system, and making use of In- Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU). This system-level analysis was conducted by comparing equivalent system mass of the eight technologies in open and closed loop life support architectures. The most promising high pressure O 2 generation technologies were recommended for development. Updates and an expansion of the earlier study have been made and the results are reported in this paper. Examples of recent analyses include feasibility of recovering space suit purge O 2 in a Pressurized Rover and using sub-critical LOX for primary supply while using high-pressure gaseous O 2 as the secondary supply for the space-suit. Preliminary analysis on scavenging LOX from the Lander and delivering it to the Habitat has also been incorporated into this integrated lunar fluids analysi...|$|R

40|$|Hydrogen is an {{environmentally}} attractive transportation fuel {{that has the}} potential to displace fossil fuels. The Freedom CAR and Freedom FUEL initiatives emphasize the importance of hydrogen as a future transportation fuel. Presently, Las Vegas has one hydrogen fueling station powered by natural gas. However, the use of traditional sources of energy to produce hydrogen does not maximize the benefit. The hydrogen fueling station developed under this grant used electrolysis units and solar energy to produce hydrogen fuel. Water and electricity are furnished to the unit and the output is hydrogen and oxygen. Three vehicles were converted to utilize the hydrogen produced at the station. The vehicles were all equipped with different types of technologies. The vehicles were used in the day-to-day operation of the Las Vegas Valley Water District and monitoring was performed on efficiency, reliability and maintenance requirements. The research and demonstration utilized for the reconfiguration of these vehicles could lead to new technologies in vehicle development that could make hydrogen-fueled vehicles more cost effective, economical, efficient and more widely used. In order to advance the development of a hydrogen future in Southern Nevada, project partners recognized a need to bring various entities involved in hydrogen development and deployment together as a means of sharing knowledge and eliminating duplication of efforts. A road-mapping session was held in Las Vegas in June 2006. The Nevada State Energy Office, representatives from DOE, DOE contractors and LANL, NETL, NREL were present. Leadership from the National hydrogen Association Board of Directors also attended. As a result of this session, a roadmap for hydrogen development was created. This roadmap has the ability to become a tool for use by other road-mapping efforts in the hydrogen community. It could also become a standard template for other states or even countries to approach planning for a hydrogen future. Project partners also conducted a workshop on hydrogen safety and permitting. This provided an opportunity for the various permitting agencies and end users to gather to share experiences and knowledge. As a result of this workshop, the permitting process for the hydrogen filling station on the Las Vegas Valley Water District’s land was done more efficiently and those who would be responsible for the operation were better educated on the safety and reliability of hydrogen production and storage. The lessons learned in permitting the filling station and conducting this workshop provided a basis for future hydrogen projects in the region. Continuing efforts to increase the working <b>pressure</b> of <b>electrolysis</b> and efficiency have been pursued. Research was also performed on improving the cost, efficiency and durability of Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) hydrogen technology. Research elements focused upon PEM membranes, electrodes/catalysts, membrane-electrode assemblies, seals, bipolar plates, utilization of renewable power, reliability issues, scale, and advanced conversion topics. Additionally, direct solar-to-hydrogen conversion research to demonstrate stable and efficient photoelectrochemistry (PEC) hydrogen production systems based on a number of optional concepts was performed. Candidate PEC concepts included technical obstacles such as inefficient photocatalysis, inadequate photocurrent due to non-optimal material band gap energies, rapid electron-hole recombination, reduced hole mobility and diminished operational lifetimes of surface materials exposed to electrolytes.

Included in this report are data on separator materials, electrode materials, structural cell design, and dissolved gas tests. Also included are the results of trade studies for active area, component design analysis, high pressure hydrogen/oxygen reactions, and control systems design. Several key pieces of a high <b>pressure</b> <b>electrolysis</b> system were investigated in this project and the results will be useful in further attempts at high pressure and/or low cost hydrogen generator projects. An important portion of the testing and research performed in this study are the safety issues that are present in a high pressure electrolyzer system and that they can not easily be simplified to a level where units can be manufactured at the cost goals specified, or operated by other than trained personnel in a well safeguarded environment. The two key objectives of the program were to develop a system to supply hydrogen at a rate of at least 10, 000 scf/day at a pressure of 5000 psi, and to meet cost goals of $ 600 / kW in production quantities of 10, 000 /year. On these two points TESI was not successful.

40|$|Hydrogen {{has been}} called the fuel of the future, and as it’s non- {{renewable}} counterparts become scarce the economic viability of hydrogen gains traction. The potential of hydrogen is marked by its high mass specific energy density and wide applicability as a fuel in fuel cell vehicles and homes. However hydrogen’s volume must be reduced via pressurization or liquefaction {{in order to make it}} more transportable and volume efficient. Currently the vast majority of industrially produced hydrogen comes from steam reforming of natural gas. This practice yields low-pressure gas which must then be compressed at considerable cost and uses fossil fuels as a feedstock leaving behind harmful CO and CO 2 gases as a by-product. The second method used by industry to produce hydrogen gas is low <b>pressure</b> <b>electrolysis.</b> In comparison the electrolysis of water at low pressure can produce pure hydrogen and oxygen gas with no harmful by-products using only water as a feedstock, but it will still need to be compressed before use. Multiple theoretical works agree that high <b>pressure</b> <b>electrolysis</b> could reduce the energy losses due to product gas compression. However these works openly admit that their projected gains are purely theoretical and ignore the practical limitations and resistances of a real life high pressure system. The goal of this work is to experimentally confirm the proposed thermodynamic gains of ultra-high <b>pressure</b> <b>electrolysis</b> in alkaline solution and characterize the behavior of a real life high pressure system.

40|$|Differential <b>pressure</b> <b>electrolysis</b> {{offers the}} {{potential}} for more efficient hydrogen compression. Due to the differential pressures acting within the electrolytic cell, the porous transport layer (PTL) is subjected to high stress. For safety reasons, the PTL's mechanical stability must be ensured. However, the requirements for high porosity and low thickness stand in contrast to that for mechanical stability. Porous transport layers for polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolysis are typically prepared {{by means of the}} thermal sintering of titanium powder. Thus far, the factors that influence the mechanical strength of the sintered bodies and how all requirements can be simultaneously fulfilled have not been investigated. Here, the static and dynamic mechanical properties of thin sintered titanium sheets are investigated ex-situ via tensile tests and periodic loading in a test cell, respectively. In order for a sintered PTL with a thickness of 500 μm and porosities above 25 % to be able to withstand 50 bar differential pressure in the cell, the maximum flow field width should be limited to 3 mm. Thus, a method was developed to test the suitability of PTL materials for use in electrolysis for various differential pressures and flow field widths...|$|E
