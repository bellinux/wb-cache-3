50|$|Unlike the <b>protocol</b> <b>analyzer,</b> {{whose main}} {{characteristic}} {{is not the}} reconstruction of the data carried by the protocols, Xplico was born expressly with the aim to reconstruct the protocol's application data and it is able to recognize the protocols with a technique named Port Independent Protocol Identification (PIPI).|$|E
50|$|Some <b>protocol</b> <b>analyzers</b> {{can also}} {{generate}} traffic and thus {{act as the}} reference device. These can act as protocol testers.

50|$|<b>Protocol</b> <b>analyzers</b> {{can also}} be hardware-based, either in probe format or, as is {{increasingly}} common, combined with a disk array.

Physical-layer tests can be performed while the system under test is processing live bus traffic.|$|E
50|$|BFMs are {{sometimes}} referred to as TVMs or Transaction Verification Models. This is to emphasize that bus operations of the model have been bundled into atomic bus transactions {{to make it easier to}} issue and view bus transactions. Viewing of bus transactions of TVMs is similar to viewing the output of a <b>protocol</b> <b>analyzer</b> or bus sniffer.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>protocol</b> <b>analyzer</b> {{is a tool}} (hardware or software) used {{to capture}} and analyze signals and data traffic over a {{communication}} channel. Such a channel varies from a local computer bus to a satellite link, that provides a means of communication using a standard communication protocol (networked or point-to-point). Each type of communication protocol has a different tool to collect and analyze signals and data.|$|E

50|$|A bus {{analyzer}} {{is designed}} for use with specific parallel or serial bus architectures. Though the term bus analyzer implies a physical communication and interface that is being analyzed, it is sometimes used interchangeably with the term <b>protocol</b> <b>analyzer</b> or Packet Analyzer, and may be used also for analysis tools for Wireless interfaces like wireless LAN (like Wi-Fi), PAN (like Bluetooth, Wireless USB), and other, though these technologies {{do not have a}} “Wired” Bus.|$|E
50|$|A packet {{analyzer}} (also {{known as}} a network analyzer, <b>protocol</b> <b>analyzer</b> or packet sniffer—or, for particular types of networks, an Ethernet sniffer or wireless sniffer) is a computer program or piece of computer hardware that can intercept and log traffic that passes over a digital network or part of a network. As data streams flow across the network, the sniffer captures each packet and, if needed, decodes the packet's raw data, showing the values of various fields in the packet, and analyzes its content according to the appropriate RFC or other specifications.|$|E
50|$|Savvius (formerly WildPackets) {{was founded}} in 1990 as The AG Group by Mahboud Zabetian and Tim McCreery. They soon changed their name to WildPackets. The first product by Savvius was written for the Mac and called EtherPeek. It was a <b>protocol</b> <b>analyzer</b> for Ethernet networks. It was later ported to Microsoft Windows, which was {{released}} in 1997. In 2001, AiroPeek was released, which added support for wireless IEEE 802.11 (marketed with the Wi-Fi brand) networks. In 2003, the OmniEngine Distributed Capture Engine was released as software, and as a hardware network recorder appliance.|$|E

50|$|The Nortel Discovery Protocol had {{its origin}} in the SynOptics Network Management Protocol (SONMP), {{developed}} before the SynOptics and Wellfleet Communications merger in 1994. The protocol was rebranded as the Bay Network Management Protocol (BNMP) and some <b>protocol</b> <b>analyzers</b> referenced it as the Bay Discovery Protocol (BDP). Four years later, in 1998, Bay Networks was acquired by Nortel and renamed it to Nortel Discovery Protocol.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{introduces}} {{two approaches}} {{to develop the}} network <b>protocol</b> <b>analyzers,</b> {{one of which is}} based on NDIS (Network Driver Interface Specification), the other is based on WinPcap. The second approach is discussed in de-tails. This paper outlines the WinPcap architecture. Functions exported by WinPcap are classified in three types. On this classification, we can accurately configure the developing environment, e. g. define the preprocessors, set working directo-ries. Three basic functions, i. e. pcap _ findalldevs_ex(), pcap_open(), and pcap_next_ex(), are interpreted thoroughly. In the end, a step-by-step example is given with its outcomes...|$|R
