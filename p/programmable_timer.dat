5000|$|Most video {{recorders}} were also unable to change channels under control of built-in timers when using a converter, as channel selection was then {{handled by the}} converter. [...] Some converter boxes have a <b>programmable</b> <b>timer,</b> which the user could program to match the recording schedule of their VCR. Then, the converter's tuner will change to the appropriate channel {{at the time the}} VCR needs to record. This requires a separate box for the VCR, or the viewer will have to watch what is being recorded. Another, less common option is an [...] "IR blaster", which a recorder can use to control an external tuner, like a cable set-top box or converter box. However, older devices with IR blasters may not be fully compatible with digital subchannels; the converter box may require the use of a - or [...] button to specify the subchannel, which the pre-digital recorder may not know how to transmit. Some older TiVo brand digital recorders received software updates specifically to control digital converter boxes via the TiVo's included IR blaster.|$|E

A real-time method of setting the 120 ° phase shift between the three phases of the pulses using the PTM was developed and showed a good level of accuracy.
