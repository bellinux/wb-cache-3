40|$|AbstractDuring {{environment}} testing, {{the time}} histories of some dynamic environments follow non-Gaussian distribution. It is always {{assumed that the}} <b>random</b> <b>vibration</b> simulated follows Gaussian distribution, because the traditional digital <b>random</b> <b>vibration</b> control system can only supply the <b>random</b> <b>vibration</b> excitation signal of Gaussian. To simulate the real environment of product, a method is developed in this paper that can generate non-Gaussian random signal with specified power spectrum density (PSD), skewness and kurtosis by shot noise. In this way, non-Gaussian <b>random</b> <b>vibration</b> can be produced on traditional electrodynamic shaker.

30|$|Frequency-domain {{analysis}} is another {{common type of}} <b>random</b> <b>vibration</b> analysis [6]. Many studies [7, 8, 9] on the <b>random</b> <b>vibration</b> of a vehicle–track system have employed frequency-domain analysis. To improve the efficiency of computation, Lin and Zhang [10] put forward a pseudo-excitation method. The pseudo-excitation method was then adopted by Lu et al. [11] and Zhang et al. [12, 13] to analyze the vertical <b>random</b> <b>vibration</b> of a vehicle–track coupled system. This method regards the track structure as a periodic structure and solves the spreading of harmonic virtual track irregularity excitation in the track substructure with a symplectic mathematics method. This method needs only four stress track substructures in the calculation, which greatly reduces the number of degrees of freedom (DOFs) and greatly improves the calculation efficiency. Employing the pseudo-excitation method, Zhang et al. [14] studied the <b>random</b> <b>vibration</b> of the vehicle–slab track coupled system and analyzed {{the effects of the}} vehicle speed and slab track parameters on the <b>random</b> <b>vibration</b> of the system.|$|R

50|$|In {{mechanical}} engineering, <b>random</b> <b>vibration</b> is motion {{which is}} non-deterministic, meaning that future behavior cannot be precisely predicted.

40|$|<b>Random</b> <b>vibration</b> {{induced load}} is an {{important}} component of the total design load environment for payload and launch vehicle components and their support structures. The current approach to <b>random</b> <b>vibration</b> load estimation is based, particularly at the preliminary design stage, on the use of Miles' equation which assumes a single degree-of-freedom (DOF) system and white noise excitation. This paper examines the implications of the use of multi-DOF system models and response calculation based on numerical integration using the actual excitation spectra for <b>random</b> <b>vibration</b> load estimation. The analytical study presented considers a two-DOF system and brings out the effects of modal mass, damping and frequency ratios on the <b>random</b> <b>vibration</b> load factor. The results indicate that load estimates based on the Miles' equation can be significantly different from the more accurate estimates based on multi-DOF models...|$|R

40|$|<b>Random</b> <b>vibration</b> {{coupled with}} thermal cycling {{is a common}} {{environment}} {{for a lot of}} mechanical and electrical products, especially for those experiencing transportation and handling frequently. Today, <b>random</b> <b>vibration</b> plus thermal cycling have been broadly applied as an important stimulus stress to expose the latent defects during development. In addition, drop tests are also necessary for these products since an accidental drop may seriously damage them. Both <b>random</b> <b>vibration</b> and drop tests are expensive. Plate element is popular in portable and transportation related products, for example, the Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) in equipment installed in vehicles, the Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs) in portable computers and the skin panels near the engines in airplanes. These plate elements are subjected to <b>random</b> <b>vibration</b> and thermal cycling, and some of them may encounter a drop. Even through the deterministic vibration theory of plates has been developed a lot, the <b>random</b> <b>vibration</b> theory of plates has not been well explored yet, particularly in reliability quantification, response analysis, and thermal load effect. In this dissertation, a <b>random</b> <b>vibration</b> analysis model for packaged plates is proposed for base excited <b>random</b> <b>vibration</b> coupled with temperature loads. Based on this model, a reliability quantification model is proposed, too. Two common <b>random</b> <b>vibration</b> power spectral densities "Ideal White Noise (IWN) " and "Band Limited White Noise (BLWN) " are researched. As a result, the closed form solution for IWN is derived and the numerical procedure for BLWN is presented. By comparing the IWN results with the BLWN results, an application limit to IWN is discovered. The effects of temperature and damping on reliability are then investigated. For the drop load case, the response process and the reliability are researched, and the illustrative example is given to demonstrate the methodology. The research results of the dissertation may supply designers with guidelines and supplement testing with analytical data; therefore, the test cost can hopefully be cut down. The methodologies {{can be applied to the}} evaluation of transportation reliability...|$|R

40|$|Nonlinear biodynamic {{responses}} {{are evident in}} many studies of the apparent masses of sitting and standing subjects in static postures that require muscle activity for postural control. In the present study, 12 male subjects adopted a relaxed semi-supine posture assumed to involve less muscle activity than during static sitting and standing. The supine subjects were exposed to two types of vertical vibration (in the x-axis of the semi-supine body) : (i) continuous <b>random</b> <b>vibration</b> (0. 25 – 20 Hz) at five magnitudes (0. 125, 0. 25, 0. 5, 0. 75, and 1. 0 m s? 2 rms); (ii) intermittent <b>random</b> <b>vibration</b> (0. 25 – 20 Hz) alternately at 0. 25 and 1. 0 m s? 2 rms. With continuous <b>random</b> <b>vibration,</b> the dominant primary resonance frequency in the median normalised apparent mass decreased from 10. 35 to 7. 32 Hz as the vibration magnitude increased from 0. 125 to 1. 0 m s? 2 rms. This nonlinear response was apparent in both the vertical (x-axis) apparent mass and in the horizontal (z-axis) cross-axis apparent mass. As the vibration magnitude increased from 0. 25 to 1. 0 m s? 2 rms, the median resonance frequency of the apparent mass with intermittent <b>random</b> <b>vibration</b> decreased from 9. 28 to 8. 06 Hz whereas, over the same range of magnitudes with continuous <b>random</b> <b>vibration,</b> the resonance frequency decreased from 9. 62 to 7. 81 Hz. The median change in the resonance frequency (between 0. 25 and 1. 0 m s? 2 rms) was 1. 37 Hz with the intermittent <b>random</b> <b>vibration</b> and 1. 71 with the continuous <b>random</b> <b>vibration.</b> With the intermittent vibration, the resonance frequency was higher at the high magnitude and lower at the low magnitude than with continuous vibration of the same magnitudes. The response was typical of thixotropy {{that may be a}} primary cause of the nonlinear biodynamic responses to whole-body vibration...|$|R
40|$|<b>Random</b> <b>vibrations</b> {{occur during}} the launch at the {{fastening}} interface between thruster brackets and basic support of satellite. These are {{generated in the}} launcher by the motion of some mechanical parts, combustion phenomena or structural elements excited by the acoustic environment. The goal of this comparative study {{is to find a}} simplified and efficient validation method using FEM PATRAN-NASTRAN software for thruster brackets in the <b>random</b> <b>vibrations</b> environment for space applications. The <b>random</b> <b>vibration</b> analysis requests complex pre/ post processing efforts and large hardware resources for various geometrical shapes. The PATRAN-NASTRAN <b>random</b> <b>vibration</b> analysis consists of frequency response analysis (111 solver) and Acceleration Spectral Density (ASD) diagram, taking into account the natural frequencies of the bracket. The Miles method computes the root mean square acceleration (aRMS) using the natural frequencies and the ASD diagram as input. As a conservative hypothesis in the random analysis, the three sigma standard deviation criteria in normal Gaussian distribution is applied at these RMS acceleration values, which means to multiply the aRMS by a load factor of three. Simplified method consists of using linear static PATRAN-NASTRAN analysis (101 solver) where the aRMS are introduced as loads. For validation of the simplified method, a comparative study was made between the <b>random</b> <b>vibration</b> and the linear static analysis. The final results are presented in detail in this article...|$|R
