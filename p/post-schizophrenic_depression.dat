However, {{there are a few}} theories as to possible causes. Those suffering from <b>post-schizophrenic</b> <b>depression</b> often suffer from social isolation due to their illness, which may increase depression levels. [...] There is strong evidence of stigma-related isolation against those suffering from mental illnesses in a variety of societies, especially those with schizophrenia as they are often viewed as dangerous and unpredictable. [...] Because of this isolation and studies linking social isolation and depression, it is possible that patients under these stigmas eventually develop <b>post-schizophrenic</b> <b>depression.</b> [...] Depression in patients with schizophrenia may also be caused by substance abuse, which is fairly common among those suffering from schizophrenia, as depressants such as alcohol and cannabis can relax the patient. [...] Furthermore, with what little information is currently known about <b>post-schizophrenic</b> <b>depression,</b> the onset may be caused by not giving patients with schizophrenia antipsychotic medications. [...] After being taken off of antipsychotic medication, schizophrenic patients' antidepressant medication had to be increased, while those under antipsychotic medication reported suffering fewer depressive symptoms, further giving reason to believe that a lack of antipsychotic medication in earlier stages of schizophrenia may lead to <b>post-schizophrenic</b> <b>depression.</b> [...] However, some psychology professionals still push for the reduction of neuroleptic drugs, as there is a popular belief that <b>post-schizophrenic</b> <b>depression</b> is caused by neuroleptic treatment. [...] Therapists are also believed to engage the depression in people with schizophrenia, having given too much psychotherapy after the patient had overcome their schizophrenic symptoms. [...] Schizophrenia itself should not be overlooked as a key player in causing <b>post-schizophrenic</b> <b>depression,</b> though. A study done over a two-year time period shadowing patients with schizophrenia and monitoring their depression was unable to locate possible triggers such as the ones previously listed, so it is possible the nature of schizophrenia itself is the primary cause of <b>post-schizophrenic</b> <b>depression.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Post-schizophrenic</b> <b>depression</b> is a [...] "depressive episode arising in the {{aftermath}} of a schizophrenic illness where some low-level schizophrenic symptoms may still be present." [...] Someone that suffers from <b>post-schizophrenic</b> <b>depression</b> experiences both symptoms of depression and can also continue showing mild symptoms of schizophrenia. Unfortunately, depression is a common symptom found in patients with schizophrenia and can fly under the radar for years before others become aware of its presence in a patient. [...] However, very little research has been done on the subject, meaning there are few answers to how it should be systematically diagnosed, treated, or what course the illness will take. [...] Some scientists would entirely deny the existence of <b>post-schizophrenic</b> <b>depression,</b> insisting it is a phase in schizophrenia as a whole. As of late, <b>post-schizophrenic</b> <b>depression</b> has become officially recognized as a syndrome and is considered a sub-type of schizophrenia.|$|E
5000|$|Those {{suffering}} from <b>post-schizophrenic</b> <b>depression</b> are also commonly {{at risk for}} suicidal tendencies. [...] There is a trend correlated between suicide and <b>post-schizophrenic</b> <b>depression</b> according to Mulholland and Cooper's research in [...] "The Symptoms of Depression in Schizophrenia and its Management." [...] Furthermore, depression and schizophrenia have both been studied individually to try {{to determine if there}} is a correlation, and research has indicated that there is a very strong tendency for people with depression or schizophrenia to attempt suicide. [...] Statistically, out of all patients {{suffering from}} schizophrenia, [...] "10%...commit suicide. Depressed patients with schizophrenia are at a particularly high risk for suicide the first few months after diagnosis and after hospital discharge." [...] Risk factors increasing the chance of suicide are, from highest to lowest, previous depressive orders, previous suicide attempts, drug abuse, and several other factors. [...] Surprisingly, the suicide risk actually decreased with the presence of hallucinations. [...] The ICD-10 Classification of MEntal and Behavioural Disorders officially recognizes suicide as being a prominent aspect of <b>post-schizophrenic</b> <b>depression.</b> Because of this drastic increase in suicide, {{it can be difficult to}} study <b>post-schizophrenic</b> <b>depression</b> as many of its victims tragically take their own lives.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{the nature}} of acute {{schizophrenia}} is similar to depression, {{it is difficult to}} differentiate normal levels of depression in patients with schizophrenia from depressive levels in <b>post-schizophrenic</b> <b>depression.</b> [...] "Prominent subjectively low mood, suggesting depression, and prominent blunting of affect, suggesting negative symptoms, are the two features which are most helpful in differentiating and depression." [...] A number of researchers believe that depression is actually a symptom of schizophrenia that has been hidden by the psychosis. However, symptoms usually arise after the first psychotic episodes if they will arise at all. [...] Officially, diagnosing post-schizophrenia depression in a patient requires for the patient to be experiencing a depressive episode of either short or long term following the overcoming of schizophrenia. The patient must still demonstrate some schizophrenic symptoms but those symptoms must no longer be the focus of the illness. Typically, the depressive symptoms are not severe enough to be classified as a severe depressive episode. [...] Formally, diagnosis entails the patient having had schizophrenia within the past year, a number of schizophrenic symptoms, and depression being present for two weeks or more. Mild schizophrenic signs may be withdrawing socially, agitation or hostility, and irregular sleep such {{as in the case of}} insomnia and hypersomnia.|$|E

Therefore, this work of the author is devoted to the analysis of the scientific and theoretical substantiation of the problem of <b>post-schizophrenic</b> <b>depression</b> (PSD). The methods were analysis and synthesis of existing scientific-theoretical and experimental research in the field of PSD. The purpose of the study was to analyze the existing scientific achievements in the field of psychiatry, psychology and medicine to clarify all clinical and diagnostic aspects: the etiology of pathogenesis; clinics; definition and nosological qualification of the PSD. Since the volume and content of PSD as an independent diagnostic category, first identified in the ICD- 10 (1994) in the section "Schizophrenia," does not allow comprehensive clarification of all clinical and diagnostic aspects, but only actualizes the issue of their: the etiology of pathogenesis; clinics; definition and nosological qualification. The solution of these issues is closely connected with the clarification of the clinical and psychopathological content of schizophrenia as a nosological unit and the improvement of its taxonomy; hence the study of the PSD is becoming increasingly relevant in the modern period.

40|$|Depressive episodes are {{a common}} and {{potentially}} severe occurrence in schizophrenia but are poorly recognised by psychiatrists. Coherent diagnostic criteria are necessary to improve {{diagnosis and treatment of}} these conditions. To evaluate the usefulness of the ICD- 10 category of <b>post-schizophrenic</b> <b>depression</b> (PSD) and the DSM-IV category of postpsychotic depressive disorder of schizophrenia (PDDS), 80 clinically stable schizophrenic outpatients were evaluated with two independent measures of depression, a dimensional measure and a categorical measure. One rater applied the DSM-IV criteria for major depressive episodes (MDE), and the other applied the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, and the Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale. Thirteen patients (16. 3 %) met criteria for MDE. All of them met the DSM-IV PDDS research criteria, but only two patients matched the ICD- 10 PSD criteria, which require that the episode occurred in the 12 months after the last psychotic episode. There {{was no significant difference in}} the incidence of depressive episodes within 12 months after an acute psychotic episode and outside this time period. the data suggest that depressive episodes in schizophrenia are not restricted to the first year following the psychotic episode. Useful criteria for depressive episodes in schizophrenia should avoid a temporal relation with the psychotic episode. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.
