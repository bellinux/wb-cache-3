5|$|Plasmid {{stabilising}} toxin-antitoxin {{systems have}} been used as examples of selfish DNA as part of the gene centered view of evolution. It has been theorised that toxin-antitoxin loci serve only to maintain their own DNA, {{at the expense of the}} host organism. Other theories propose the systems have evolved to increase the fitness of <b>plasmids</b> in competition with other <b>plasmids.</b> Thus, the toxin-antitoxin system confers an advantage to the host DNA by eliminating competing <b>plasmids</b> in cell progeny. This theory was corroborated through computer modelling. This does not, however, explain the presence of toxin-antitoxin systems on chromosomes.|$|E
5|$|The player {{collects}} {{money by}} exploring Rapture {{and from the}} bodies of defeated foes; this money can be used at vending machines to restock on ammunition, health and EVE, and other items; like security cameras, vending machines can also be hacked to reduce the costs of items from it. The player will also receive rewards {{in the form of}} ADAM from completing some tasks, as well as from either saving or killing the Little Sisters after defeating their Big Daddy guardian. ADAM is used to purchase new <b>plasmids</b> from Gatherer's Garden machines scattered around Rapture. In addition to <b>plasmids,</b> the player will also collect and buy tonics that provide passive bonuses, such as increasing Jack's strength, using EVE more efficiently, or making Jack more resistant to damage. The player can only have a limited number of <b>plasmids</b> and tonics active at any time, and can swap between the various <b>plasmids</b> and tonics at certain stations located throughout Rapture.|$|E
50|$|The <b>plasmid</b> {{containing}} the transposon (the donor <b>plasmid)</b> fuses {{with a host}} <b>plasmid</b> (the target <b>plasmid).</b> In the process, the transposon and a short section of host DNA are replicated. The end product is a 'cointegrate' <b>plasmid</b> containing two copies of the transposon.|$|R
40|$|The further {{identification}} of {{regions of the}} colicin E 1 <b>plasmid</b> that affect <b>plasmid</b> functions has been achieved by studying deletions and TnA insertions of the <b>plasmid.</b> Colicin production, colicin immunity, relaxation of <b>plasmid</b> deoxyribonucleic acid, and <b>plasmid</b> incompatibility functions have been examined. A strong correlation has been observed between the ability of colicin E 1 <b>plasmid</b> deoxyribonucleic acid to be relaxed {{and the ability of}} that <b>plasmid</b> to be transferred by conjugation...|$|R
40|$|<b>Plasmid</b> ColVBtrp {{maintenance}} in Erwinia carotovora cells {{was followed}} by measuring kinetics of elimination of <b>plasmid</b> genetic markers and loss of <b>plasmid</b> deoxyribonucleic acid. An E. carotovora mutant stably carrying <b>plasmid</b> ColVBtrp was isolated. Besides stable <b>plasmid</b> maintenance, the mutant showed altered sensitivity to male-specific phage MS 2, sensitivity to drugs, and colony morphology...|$|R
5|$|Archaea {{usually have}} a single {{circular}} chromosome, {{with as many as}} 5,751,492base pairs in Methanosarcina acetivorans, the largest known archaeal genome. The tiny 490,885base-pair genome of Nanoarchaeum equitans is one-tenth of this size and the smallest archaeal genome known; it is estimated to contain only 537 protein-encoding genes. Smaller independent pieces of DNA, called <b>plasmids,</b> are also found in archaea. <b>Plasmids</b> may be transferred between cells by physical contact, in a process that may be similar to bacterial conjugation.|$|E
5|$|Prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) {{typically}} {{store their}} genomes {{on a single}} large, circular chromosome. Similarly, some eukaryotic organelles contain a remnant circular chromosome with {{a small number of}} genes. Prokaryotes sometimes supplement their chromosome with additional small circles of DNA called <b>plasmids,</b> which usually encode only a few genes and are transferable between individuals. For example, the genes for antibiotic resistance are usually encoded on bacterial <b>plasmids</b> and can be passed between individual cells, even those of different species, via horizontal gene transfer.|$|E
5|$|Their genome {{is usually}} a {{circular}} bacterial chromosome – a single loop of DNA, although they can also harbor small pieces of DNA called <b>plasmids.</b> These <b>plasmids</b> can be transferred between cells through bacterial conjugation. Bacteria have an enclosing cell wall, which provides strength and rigidity to their cells. They reproduce by binary fission or sometimes by budding, but do not undergo meiotic sexual reproduction. However, many bacterial species can transfer DNA between individual cells by a horizontal gene transfer process referred to as natural transformation. Some species form extraordinarily resilient spores, but for bacteria this is a mechanism for survival, not reproduction. Under optimal conditions bacteria can grow extremely rapidly and can double as quickly as every 20 minutes.|$|E
40|$|Stability of the <b>plasmid</b> pKK 223 - 200 in Escherichia coli JM 105 was {{studied for}} both free and immobilized cells during {{continuous}} culture. The relationship between <b>plasmid</b> copy number, xylanase activity, which was coded {{for by the}} <b>plasmid,</b> and growth rate and culture conditions involved complex interactions which determined the <b>plasmid</b> stability. Generally, the <b>plasmid</b> stability was enhanced in cultured immobilized cells compared with free-cell cultures. This stability was associated with modified <b>plasmid</b> copy number, depending on the media used. Hypotheses are presented concerning the different <b>plasmid</b> instability kinetics observed in free-cell cultures which involve the antagonistic effects of <b>plasmid</b> copy number and <b>plasmid</b> presence on the plasmid-bearing/plasmid-free cell growth rate ratio. Both diffusional limitation in carrageenan gel beads, which is described in Theoretical Analysis of Immobilized-Cell Growth, and compartmentalized growth of immobilized cells are proposed to explain <b>plasmid</b> stability in immobilized cells...|$|R
40|$|A <b>plasmid</b> of mol. wt. ∼ 9 × 106 {{has been}} {{isolated}} from the archaebacterium Sulfolobus acidocaldarius strain B 12. <b>Plasmid</b> production is induced by u. v. radiation. A copy of the <b>plasmid</b> is probably carried by the chromosome, integrated at a specific site. The entire <b>plasmid,</b> and also restriction fragments of it, has been cloned into Escherichia coli <b>plasmid</b> vectors, and the cleavage sites on the <b>plasmid</b> DNA of three restriction endonucleases have been mapped...|$|R
40|$|All of the plasmid-carried genes {{expressed}} during vegetative {{growth are}} essential for long-term maintenance of <b>plasmid</b> Ddp 1 in the nucleus of Dictyostelium discoideum. Deletion of Ddp 1 genes expressed only during development had no detectable effect on <b>plasmid</b> maintenance. Deletion of vegetatively expressed genes, either singly or in pairs, resulted in (i) a rapid loss of <b>plasmid</b> from cells grown {{in the absence of}} selection for <b>plasmid</b> retention, (ii) variation in the proportion of monomer to multimer forms of the <b>plasmid</b> molecules, and/or (iii) abnormalities in <b>plasmid</b> copy number. At least two plasmid-encoded gene products influence patterns of expression of <b>plasmid</b> genes...|$|R
5|$|A few DNA {{sequences}} in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, {{and more}} in <b>plasmids</b> and viruses, blur the distinction between sense and antisense strands by having overlapping genes. In these cases, some DNA sequences do double duty, encoding one protein when read along one strand, and a second protein when read {{in the opposite direction}} along the other strand. In bacteria, this overlap may be involved in the regulation of gene transcription, while in viruses, overlapping genes increase the amount of information that can be encoded within the small viral genome.|$|E
5|$|An initial demo of {{the game}} was made {{available}} in August 2007 for Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows. This demo included cutscenes to introduce the player to Rapture, the game's tutorial section, and its first levels; the demo also included weapons, <b>plasmids,</b> and tonics {{that would otherwise be}} introduced later in the full title, as to give the player more of the features that would be found in the published game. The Xbox demo was the fastest demo at that time to reach one million downloads on the Xbox Live service. The full game was released for these platforms on August 21, 2007.|$|E
5|$|In December 2007, {{a common}} patch was {{released}} {{for both the}} Xbox and Windows version. The patch included additional content such as new <b>Plasmids,</b> new achievements for the Xbox 360 version, and additional graphics settings {{to address some of}} the field-of-view issues identified by players. (See below). The patch also added in an option to disable the use of Vita-Chambers, a feature requested by players to make the game more challenging, as well as an achievement to complete the game at its hardest setting without using a Vita-Chamber.|$|E
40|$|We had {{previously}} {{proposed that the}} production of concatemeric <b>plasmid</b> DNA in plasmid-transducing SPP 1 particles {{is a consequence of}} phage-directed rolling-circle-type replication of <b>plasmid</b> DNA. The production of such DNA was greatly enhanced when DNA/DNA homology was provided between phage and <b>plasmid</b> DNAs (facilitation of transduction). Here we present evidence that synthesis of concatemeric <b>plasmid</b> DNA can proceed after phage infection under conditions non-permissive for <b>plasmid</b> replication. We also propose that the naturally occurring homology between <b>plasmid</b> and phage is sufficient to account for the frequency of transduction observed in the absence of facilitating homology. Homology of greater than 47 bp gives the maximal facilitation of <b>plasmid</b> transduction. Recombination is not an essential part in the synthesis of concatemeric <b>plasmid</b> DNA...|$|R
40|$|The high-affinity iron {{assimilation}} system of <b>plasmid</b> ColV-K 30 was cloned on the vector <b>plasmid</b> pPlac. <b>Plasmid</b> pABN 1 was isolated {{by means of}} sensitivity to cloacin, a bacteriocin using the same outer membrane receptor as ferric aerobactin. Restriction maps were determined for this <b>plasmid</b> and for a subclone, pABN 5. <b>Plasmid</b> pABN 1 codes for the complete gene complex, whereas <b>plasmid</b> pABN 5 encodes only the biosynthetic genes for aerobactin. Regulation of the uptake system by iron is retained in cloned sequences of pABN 1...|$|R
40|$|Yeast strains {{carrying}} a 1. 5 x 106 molecular weight linear double-stranded RNA in virus-like particles (M dsRNA, the killer <b>plasmid</b> or virus) secrete a toxin that is lethal to strains not carrying this <b>plasmid.</b> Recessive mutations {{in any of}} four chromosomal genes (called ski 1 -ski 4) result in increased production of toxin activity. We report here a mutation of the killer <b>plasmid</b> (called [KIL-sd] for ski-dependent) that makes the killer <b>plasmid</b> dependent for its replication {{on the presence of}} a chromosomal mutation in any ski gene. Thus, the [KIL-sd] <b>plasmid</b> is lost from SKI+ strains. When the wild-type killer <b>plasmid,</b> [KIL-k], is introduced into a ski 2 – 2 [KIL-o] strain, the killer <b>plasmid</b> changes to a [KIL-sd] <b>plasmid.</b> This may represent a specific form of mutagenesis or selective replication in the ski 2 – 2 strain of [KIL-sd] variants (mutants) in the normal [KIL-k] population. The ski 2 – 1 and ski 2 – 3 mutations do not convert [KIL-k] to [KIL-sd], but ski 2 – 3 does allow maintenance of the [KIL-sd] <b>plasmid.</b> The [KIL-sd] <b>plasmid</b> thus lacks a <b>plasmid</b> site or product needed for replication in wild-type cells...|$|R
5|$|In prokaryotes the cytosol {{contains}} the cell's genome, within a structure {{known as a}} nucleoid. This is an irregular mass of DNA and associated proteins that control the transcription and replication of the bacterial chromosome and <b>plasmids.</b> In eukaryotes the genome is held within the cell nucleus, which is separated from the cytosol by nuclear pores that block the free diffusion of any molecule larger than about 10nanometres in diameter.|$|E
5|$|Methods {{have been}} {{developed}} to purify DNA from organisms, such as phenol-chloroform extraction, and to manipulate it in the laboratory, such as restriction digests and the polymerase chain reaction. Modern biology and biochemistry make intensive use of these techniques in recombinant DNA technology. Recombinant DNA is a man-made DNA sequence that has been assembled from other DNA sequences. They can be transformed into organisms in the form of <b>plasmids</b> or in the appropriate format, by using a viral vector. The genetically modified organisms produced can be used to produce products such as recombinant proteins, used in medical research, or be grown in agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bacteria}} have {{a single}} circular chromosome that can {{range in size from}} only 160,000 base pairs in the endosymbiotic bacteria Candidatus Carsonella ruddii, to 12,200,000 base pairs in the soil-dwelling bacteria Sorangium cellulosum. The genes in bacterial genomes are usually a single continuous stretch of DNA and although several different types of introns do exist in bacteria, these are much rarer than in eukaryotes. Some bacteria, including the Spirochaetes of the genus Borrelia are a notable exception to this arrangement. Borrelia burgdorferi, the cause of Lyme disease, contains a single linear chromosome and several linear and circular <b>plasmids.</b>|$|E
40|$|Two domains at the replicative {{origin of}} broad-host-range <b>plasmid</b> R 1162 are {{required}} in cis for <b>plasmid</b> maintenance in Escherichia coli and for <b>plasmid</b> DNA replication in cell extracts. Increasing {{the distance between}} the domains reduces replication in vitro, without substantially changing <b>plasmid</b> DNA content or stability in vivo...|$|R
50|$|The <b>plasmid</b> encodes a <b>plasmid</b> {{addiction}} {{system that}} kills daughter cells that lose the <b>plasmid.</b> It {{consists of a}} stable protein toxin and an antitoxin that reversibly binds to and neutralizes it. Cells that lose the <b>plasmid</b> get killed as the antitoxin gets degraded faster than the toxin.|$|R
40|$|A {{recombinant}} <b>plasmid,</b> designated pMu leu 1, {{was constructed}} from Mucor racemosus genomic DNA and Escherichia coli <b>plasmid</b> pBR 322. This <b>plasmid</b> complemented the leuB 6 mutation of E. coli, apparently by suppression. The <b>plasmid</b> contained two HindIII fragments of approximately 3. 0 and 1. 7 kilobases. Neither fragment alone exhibited complementing activity. Several proteins were {{specified by the}} <b>plasmid,</b> but their role, if any, in complementation is unknown...|$|R
5|$|The {{nucleotide}} sequence of chromosomes of Azotobacter vinelandii, strain AvOP, is partially determined. This chromosome is a circular DNA molecule which contains 5,342,073 nucleotide pairs and 5,043 genes, of which 4,988 encode proteins. The fraction of guanine + cytosine pairs is 65 mole percent. The number of chromosomes in the cells and the DNA content increases upon aging, {{and in the}} stationary growth phase, cultures may contain more than 100 copies of a chromosome per cell. The original DNA content (one copy) is restored when replanting the culture into a fresh medium. In addition to chromosomal DNA, Azotobacter can contain <b>plasmids.</b>|$|E
5|$|Chromosomal toxin-antitoxin systems also exist, some {{of which}} perform cell {{functions}} such as responding to stresses, causing cell cycle arrest and bringing about programmed cell death. In evolutionary terms, toxin-antitoxin systems can be considered selfish DNA in {{that the purpose of}} the systems are to replicate, regardless of whether they benefit the host organism or not. Some have proposed adaptive theories to explain the evolution of toxin-antitoxin systems; for example, chromosomal toxin-antitoxin systems could have evolved to prevent the inheritance of large deletions of the host genome. Toxin-antitoxin systems have several biotechnological applications, such as a method of maintaining <b>plasmids</b> in cell lines, targets for antibiotics, and as positive selection vectors.|$|E
5|$|The biotechnological {{applications}} of toxin-antitoxin systems {{have begun to}} be realised by several biotechnology organisations. A primary usage is in maintaining <b>plasmids</b> in a large bacterial cell culture. In an experiment examining {{the effectiveness of the}} hok/sok locus, it was found that segregational stability of an inserted plasmid expressing beta-galactosidase was increased by between 8 and 22 times compared to a control culture lacking a toxin-antitoxin system. In large-scale microorganism processes such as fermentation, progeny cells lacking the plasmid insert often have a higher fitness than those who inherit the plasmid and can outcompete the desirable microorganisms. A toxin-antitoxin system maintains the plasmid thereby maintaining the efficiency of the industrial process.|$|E
40|$|With the {{development}} of therapeutic methods in medicine, like are DNA vaccines and gene therapy increases demand for new processes for the isolation and purification highly pure <b>plasmid</b> DNA. Most often used methods of purification <b>plasmid</b> DNA are chromatographic methods. In experimental part of this thesis was performed isolation of <b>plasmid</b> pUC- 19 DNA <b>plasmid</b> via alkalyne lysis. And purification of <b>plasmid</b> was performed by liquid chromatography and agarose gel electrophoresis...|$|R
40|$|We have {{determined}} the entire DNA sequence of <b>plasmid</b> pKpQIL, the blaKPC- 3 -carrying <b>plasmid</b> harbored by the carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae clone sequence type 258 (ST 258) in Israel. pKpQIL is a 113, 637 -bp, self-transmissible <b>plasmid</b> {{that belongs to}} the incompatibility group IncFII. It consists of a large backbone of a pKPN 4 -like <b>plasmid</b> and carries the blaKPC- 3 -containing Tn 4401 a transposon of a pNYC-like <b>plasmid...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{nucleotide}} sequence at the oriT {{region of the}} IncI 1 <b>plasmid</b> R 64 was determined. A recombinant <b>plasmid</b> carrying a 141 -base-pair R 64 sequence was mobilized with a normal frequency, while a <b>plasmid</b> carrying only 44 base pairs of this R 64 sequence was mobilized with a frequency 1 / 10 that of the original <b>plasmid.</b> The oriT region of the R 64 <b>plasmid</b> contains two inverted-repeat sequences...|$|R
5|$|The game {{provides}} {{several options}} for players to face challenges. In addition to direct combat, the player can use <b>plasmids</b> to lure enemies into traps or to turn enemies against each other, or employ stealth tactics to avoid detection by hostiles including the security systems and turrets. The player can hack {{into any of}} Rapture's automated systems; the hacking process is done via a mini-game similar to Pipe Mania where the player must connect two points {{on opposite sides of}} a grid with a limited set of piping within a fixed amount of time, with failure to complete in time costing health and potentially sounding alarms. Early in the game, the player is given a research camera; by taking photographs of enemies, the player will cumulatively gain knowledge about the individual foes which translates into attack boosts and other benefits when facing that enemy type in the future.|$|E
5|$|Toxin-antitoxin {{systems are}} {{typically}} classified {{according to how}} the antitoxin neutralises the toxin. In a Type I toxin-antitoxin system, the translation of messenger RNA (mRNA) that encodes the toxin is inhibited by the binding of a small non-coding RNA antitoxin to the mRNA. The protein toxin in a type II system is inhibited post-translationally by the binding of another protein antitoxin. A single example of Type III toxin-antitoxin system has been described whereby a protein toxin is bound directly by an RNA molecule. Toxin-antitoxin genes are often transferred through horizontal gene transfer and are associated with pathogenic bacteria, having been found on <b>plasmids</b> conferring antibiotic resistance and virulence.|$|E
25|$|The Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis {{wild type}} strain NCPPB382 carries two <b>plasmids</b> {{associated}} with virulence: pCM1 and pCM2. The avirulent strain, CMM100, {{does not contain}} these <b>plasmids.</b> Strains that carried {{one of the two}} <b>plasmids</b> were found to be virulent but wilting symptoms were delayed. The virulent and avirulent strains produced the same amount of ectopolysaccharides, suggesting that EPS does not {{play a significant role in}} pathogenicity.|$|E
40|$|The citrate <b>plasmid</b> (Cit+ <b>plasmid)</b> from Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis biovar diacetylactis was cloned {{into the}} EcoRI site of <b>plasmid</b> pUC 18. This {{recombinant}} <b>plasmid</b> enabled Escherichia coli K- 12 to transport and utilize citrate {{as a source}} of energy, indicating expression of the citrate permease from L. lactis biovar diacetylactis. The citrate permease was {{under the control of the}} lac promoter of pUC 18. Genetic expression of the Cit+ <b>plasmid</b> in maxicells revealed that the <b>plasmid</b> encoded two polypeptides of 47 and 32 kilodaltons, determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis...|$|R
40|$|Most {{isolates}} of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium {{contain a}} 90 -kb virulence <b>plasmid.</b> This <b>plasmid</b> {{is reported to}} be mobilizable but nonconjugative. However, we have determined that the virulence <b>plasmid</b> of strains LT 2, 14028, and SR- 11 is indeed self-transmissible. The <b>plasmid</b> of strain SL 1344 is not. Optimal conjugation frequency requires filter matings on M 9 minimal glucose plates with a recipient strain lacking the virulence <b>plasmid.</b> These conditions result in a frequency of 2. 9 × 10 − 4 transconjugants/donor. Matings on Luria-Bertani plates, liquid matings, or matings with a recipient strain carrying the virulence <b>plasmid</b> reduce the efficiency by up to 400 -fold. Homologs of the F <b>plasmid</b> conjugation genes are physically located on the virulence <b>plasmid</b> and are required for the conjugative phenotype...|$|R
40|$|Ten multidrug {{resistant}} Salmonella typhi {{were isolated}} from the blood and stool samples of clinically suspected patients suffering from typhoid fever. To see whether the drug resistance phenomenon was <b>plasmid</b> mediated, one of these resistant isolates {{was used for the}} <b>plasmid</b> analysis and a single 20 kb <b>plasmid</b> was found. This 20 kb <b>plasmid</b> was transferred to a sensitive E. coli LE 392 and after the <b>plasmid</b> transfer experiment E. coli LE 392 acquired resistance against those previously used antibiotics. <b>Plasmid</b> analysis of the transformed E. coli LE 392 further exhibited that it harbored a single 20 kb <b>plasmid</b> corresponding to that of the wild S. typhi which further confirmed that the 20 kb <b>plasmid</b> was carrying the gene(s) responsible for the multidrug resistance in Salmonella typhi. </i...|$|R
