40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{review the}} {{management}} of a cohort of patients with <b>positive</b> treponemal <b>serology</b> and psychiatric and/or neurological disorders. METHODS: A retrospective case note review of 172 patients with <b>positive</b> treponemal <b>serology</b> attending the Patrick Clement's Clinic, Central Middlesex Hospital between December 1990 and November 1995 was performed. RESULTS: 101 men and 71 women were new attenders diagnosed with <b>positive</b> treponemal <b>serology.</b> A neurological problem was identified in 27 patients (12 women and 15 men) with psychiatric and/or neurological disorders, of whom 20 (six women and 14 men) underwent investigation of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). With the medical history and results of CSF-RPR and FTA tests, white cell count (WCC), and total protein level in the CSF, 10 patients (eight men and two women) were diagnosed with likely neurosyphilis and 17 with neurological disorders not thought {{to be caused by}} syphilis. The clinical features in those having neurosyphilis were sensorineural hearing loss (n = 5) and tabes dorsalis (n = 5). In the seven patients diagnosed with neurosyphilis who underwent CSF examination one patient had a reactive CSF-FTA, elevated protein, and elevated WCC; one patient had a reactive CSF-FTA and RPR with elevated protein; the total protein only was elevated in three cases and the WCC elevated in one case. Nine of the 10 patients with neurosyphilis received adequate neurosyphilitic treatment; one patient was lost to follow up.

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether a <b>positive</b> <b>serology</b> for Mimivirus was associated with increased morbidity and mortality in mechanically-ventilated patients by using a matched cohort. Methods: Patients ventilated for at least 2 days were eligible if ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) was suspected. Patients with a <b>positive</b> <b>serology</b> for Mimivirus were matched to seronegative patients. Matching criteria were (1) the same main diagnosis on ICU admission, (2) the same age (+- 10 years), (3) the same SAPS II score (+- 10 points), (4) the same McCabe and Jackson co-morbidity score, (5) admission within 1 year, and (6) diagnosis of at least one bacterial VAP during the ICU stay or not. Results: A total of 55 pairs were submitted for analysis. The effectiveness of matching was 94. 8 %. Patients with a <b>positive</b> <b>serology</b> for Mimivirus had longer mechanical ventilation and ICU stay with median excesses of 7 days and 10 days, respectively. There was no difference in ICU mortality. The duration of mechanical ventilation prior to bronchoalveolar lavage was associated with <b>positive</b> <b>serology</b> for Mimivirus (adjusted OR 1. 09, P = 0. 014) whereas immunosuppression (adjusted OR 0. 10, P = 0. 014) and enteral nutrition (adjusted OR 0. 14, P = 0. 009) were associated with the absence of seroconversion.

40|$|Abstract Background Antibody {{serology}} is {{an important}} tool {{in the investigation of}} celiac disease (CD), but does not always correlate with mucosal appearance in the small intestine. Patients with <b>positive</b> CD <b>serology</b> but normal mucosa (Marsh 0) are at increased risk of future CD. In this study we describe a model for identifying and characterizing individuals with normal mucosa but <b>positive</b> CD <b>serology.</b> Such individuals are sometimes referred to as having latent CD. Methods The records of ten Swedish pathology departments were used to identify individuals with biopsies indicating normal duodenal/jejunal mucosa. Using the national personal identification number, these data were linked with CD serology data (antigliadin, antiendomysial and tissue transglutaminase antibodies); and we thereby identified 3, 736 individuals with normal mucosa but <b>positive</b> CD <b>serology.</b> Two independent reviewers then manually reviewed their biopsy reports to estimate comorbidity. We also randomly selected 112 individuals for validation through patient chart review. Results The majority of the 3, 736 individuals were females (62 %). Children (0 â 15 years) made up 21. 4 %. The median number of biopsy specimen was 3. Our review of biopsy reports found that other gastrointestinal comorbidity was rare (inflammatory bowel disease: 0. 4 %; helicobacter pylori infection: 0. 2 %). Some 22 % individuals selected for patient chart review had a relative with CD. The most common symptoms among these individuals were diarrhea (46 %) and abdominal pain (45 %), while 26 % had anemia. Although 27 % of the individuals selected for validation had been informed about gluten-free diet, only 13 % were adhering to a gluten-free diet at the end of follow-up.

40|$|AIM: To {{assess whether}} {{schistosomiasis}} coinfection with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) influences hepatic fibrosis and pegylated-interferon/ribavirin (PEG-IFN/RIB) therapy response. METHODS: This {{study was designed}} as a retrospective analysis of 3596 chronic HCV patients enrolled in the Egyptian National Program for HCV treatment with PEG-IFN/RIB. All patients underwent liver biopsy and anti-schistosomal antibodies testing prior to HCV treatment. The serology results were used to categorize the patients into group A (<b>positive</b> schistosomal <b>serology)</b> or group B (negative schistosomal serology). Patients in group A were given oral antischistosomal treatment (praziquantel, single dose) at four weeks prior to PEG-IFN/RIB. All patients received a 48 -wk course of PEG-IFN (PEG-IFN&#x 3 B 1; 2 a or PEG-IFN&#x 3 B 1; 2 b) /RIB therapy. Clinical and laboratory follow-up examinations were carried out for 24 wk after cessation of therapy (to week 72). Correlations of <b>positive</b> schistosomal <b>serology</b> with fibrosis and treatment response were assessed by multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: Schistosomal antibody was positive in 27. 3 % of patients (15. 9 % females and 84. 1 % males). The patients in group A were older (P = 0. 008) and had a higher proportion of males (P = 0. 002) than the patients in group B. There was no significant association between fibrosis stage and <b>positive</b> schistosomal <b>serology</b> (P = 0. 703). Early virological response was achieved in significantly more patients in group B than in group A (89. 4 % vs 86. 5 %, P = 0. 015). However, significantly more patients in group A experienced breakthrough at week 24 than patients in group B (36. 3 % vs 32. 3 %, P = 0. 024). End of treatment response was achieved in more patients in group B than in group A (62. 0 % vs 59. 1 %) but the difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0. 108). Sustained virological response occurred in significantly more patients in group B than in group A (37. 6 % vs 27. 7 %, P = 0. 000). Multivariate logistic regression analysis of patient data at treatment weeks 48 and 72 showed that <b>positive</b> schistosomal <b>serology</b> was associated with failure of response to treatment at week 48 (OR = 1. 3, P = 0. 02) and at week 72 (OR = 1. 7, P < 0. 01).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} whether an observed association between cytomegalovirus (CMV) exposure and functional impairment and frailty in older adults is reproducible in {{a cohort of}} individuals aged 80 and older. DESIGN: The baseline results of the BELFRAIL study, a prospective observational cohort study, were analyzed. SETTING: Three well-circumscribed areas of Belgium. PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred sixty-seven persons aged 80 and older recruited by 29 general practitioners. MEASUREMENTS: Serum samples were assayed for levels of CMV immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies, interleukin (IL) - 6, and C-reactive protein. Measures of functional impairment were the Physical Performance Battery, Activities of Daily Living, and the Mini-Mental State Examination. Frailty was assessed using the Fried criteria. RESULTS: <b>Positive</b> CMV <b>serology</b> was found in 74 % of the population, 61 % of whom had a high anti-CMV IgG titer (> 250 Â IU/mL). CMV infection {{was not associated with}} functional or cognitive impairment. <b>Positive</b> CMV <b>serology</b> was negatively associated with prevalent frailty after adjusting for age, sex, level of education, comorbidity, smoking status, body mass index, and IL- 6 level. High levels of anti-CMV IgG were associated with functional impairment. In the adjusted models, this relationship was no longer statistically significant. There was no association between prevalent frailty or cognitive impairment and high anti-CMV IgG titers. CONCLUSION: The findings of previous studies could not be confirmed.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Endomysial {{antibody}} (EMA) {{and tissue}} transglutaminase (tTG) antibody testing {{is used to}} screen subjects with suspected celiac disease. However, the traditional gold standard for the diagnosis of celiac disease is histopathology of the small bowel. As villous atrophy may be patchy, duodenal biopsies could potentially miss the abnormalities. Capsule endoscopy can obtain images of the whole small intestine and {{may be useful in}} the early diagnosis of celiac disease. AIMS: To evaluate suspected celiac disease patients who have <b>positive</b> celiac <b>serology</b> and normal duodenal histology and to determine, with capsule endoscopy, whether these patients have any endoscopic markers of celiac disease. METHODS: Twenty-two subjects with <b>positive</b> celiac <b>serology</b> (EMA or tTG) were prospectively evaluated. Eight of the subjects had normal duodenal histology and 14 had duodenal histology consistent with celiac disease. All subjects underwent capsule endoscopy. Endoscopic markers of villous atrophy such as loss of mucosal folds, scalloping, mosaic pattern, and visible vessels were assessed. RESULTS: Eight subjects with normal duodenal histology had normal capsule endoscopy findings. In the 14 subjects with duodenal histology that was consistent with celiac disease, 13 had celiac disease changes seen at capsule endoscopy. One subject with normal capsule endoscopy findings showed Marsh IIIc on duodenal histology. Using duodenal histology as the gold standard, capsule endoscopy had a sensitivity of 93 %, specificity of 100 %, PPV of 100 %, and NPV of 89 % in recognizing villous atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: Capsule endoscopy is useful in the detection of villous abnormalities in untreated celiac disease. Patients with <b>positive</b> celiac <b>serology</b> (EMA or tTG) and normal duodenal histology are unlikely to have capsule endoscopy markers of villous atrophy. Ilmars Lidums, Adrian G.

Antibodies anti-SAPA were shown in 80. 8 % of the chagasic patients in the initial stage of the infection (<b>positive</b> IgM <b>serology</b> and/or <b>positive</b> buffy coat (BC) test) and in 81. 4 % of the patients in the indeterminate stage of the infection (<b>positive</b> IgG <b>serology</b> with negative BC and IgM tests). These results show that the anti-SAPA response is not only present during the initial stage of the infection (few months) but extends some years after infection. (RÃ©sumÃ© d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|To {{gain insight}} into the {{incidence}} and severity of pertussis in the Netherlands in 2001 and 2002, surveillance data based on notifications, laboratory data, hospitalisations and deaths were analysed for these two years and compared to that for 1989 - 2000. The decreasing coverage of serologic data from the LIS-RIVM compared with 1996 was taken into account. According to various surveillance sources pertussis is still endemic with epidemic peaks {{every two to three}} years (in 1996, 1999 and 2001). The reported incidence of notified cases was highest in 2001 (50. 2 / 100, 000) and decreased in 2002 (28. 0). The incidence/ 100, 000 in 2001 calculated from <b>positive</b> two-point <b>serology</b> amounted 4. 4 (corrected for decreasing coverage 8. 0) and <b>positive</b> one-point <b>serology</b> 30. 7 (corrected 55. 8) and hospital admissions 2. 5. The incidence calculated from these surveillance sources was again lower in 2002 : incidence/ 100, 000 <b>positive</b> two-point <b>serology</b> 2. 1 (corrected 4. 1), <b>positive</b> one-point <b>serology</b> 15. 4 (corrected 29. 9) and hospitalisations 1. 6. Highest incidence of hospitalisations was reported among infants less than 1 year (especially those aged < 3 months). In 2002 the first year an effect of the booster vaccination for four-year-olds might be visible- all surveillance sources showed a decrease in the incidence of cases aged 3 and 4 year old compared with previous years. Besides, small increases in the number of patients older than 5 years were seen. Estimations of vaccine efficacy based on surveillance data showed a slight improvement in vaccine-efficacy for the 1 -year-olds in the period 1998 - 2002 compared with 1996 - 1997. Still, pertussis is endemic with peaks every 2 to 3 years and with a higher incidence compared to the period prior to the epidemic in 1996 - 1997. The introduction of the acellular booster-vaccination for 4 -year-olds in 2001 has caused a decrease in the incidence of pertussis among the target-population. Long-term surveillance will be necessary to provide insight into the possible effect among the population at large. Estimations of vaccine-efficacy have improved in 1998 - 2002 compared to 1996 - 1997, probably {{as a result of the}} introduction of a 'stronger' pertussis vaccine in 1997. Pertussis is still most severe among young unvaccinated infants. The latter should be taken into account with the development of future vaccination-strategies (e. g. boostering of parents/care givers) ...|$|R
