5|$|Contrary to {{the view}} here <b>popularized</b> <b>by</b> Cassius Dio, however, Nerva had in fact little choice with regard to his successor.

Likewise, Edward Gibbon's assertion that Nerva hereby established a tradition of succession through adoption among the Five Good Emperors has found little support among modern historians.|$|E

Von Neumann's algorithm was the first interior point method of linear programming.|$|E

5|$|Phenomenalism is {{the theory}} that {{representations}} (or sense data) of external objects are all that exist. Such a view was briefly adopted by Bertrand Russell {{and many of the}} logical positivists during the early 20th century. A third possibility is to accept the existence of a basic substance that is neither physical nor mental. The mental and physical would then both be properties of this neutral substance. Such a position was adopted by Baruch Spinoza and was <b>popularized</b> <b>by</b> Ernst Mach in the 19th century. This neutral monism, as it is called, resembles property dualism.|$|E

5|$|The ABJM theory {{appearing}} in {{this version of}} the correspondence is also interesting for a variety of reasons. Introduced by Aharony, Bergman, Jafferis, and Maldacena, it is closely related to another quantum field theory called Chern–Simons theory.

In addition, the ABJM theory serves as a semi-realistic simplified model for solving problems that arise in condensed matter physics.|$|E
