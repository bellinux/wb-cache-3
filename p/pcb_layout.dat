25|$|Orthogonal layout methods, {{which allow}} {{the edges of}} the graph to run {{horizontally}} or vertically, parallel to the coordinate axes of the layout. These methods were originally designed for VLSI and <b>PCB</b> <b>layout</b> problems but they have also been adapted for graph drawing. They typically involve a multiphase approach in which an input graph is planarized by replacing crossing points by vertices, a topological embedding of the planarized graph is found, edge orientations are chosen to minimize bends, vertices are placed consistently with these orientations, and finally a layout compaction stage reduces the area of the drawing.|$|E
25|$|Open-source {{hardware}} (OSH) {{consists of}} physical artifacts of technology designed and {{offered by the}} open design movement. Both free and open-source software (FOSS) and open-source hardware are created by this open-source culture movement and apply a like concept {{to a variety of}} components. It is sometimes, thus, referred to as FOSH (free and open-source hardware). The term usually means that information about the hardware is easily discerned so that others can make it – coupling it closely to the maker movement. Hardware design (i.e. mechanical drawings, schematics, bills of material, <b>PCB</b> <b>layout</b> data, HDL source code and integrated circuit layout data), in addition to the software that drives the hardware, are all released under free/libre terms. The original sharer gains feedback and potentially improvements on the design from the FOSH community. There is now significant evidence that such sharing can drive a high return on investment for investors.|$|E
