5|$|In his (1991) novel Roman Blood, Steven Saylor renders a fictionalized, yet informed, {{rendition}} {{of how the}} Roman punishment poena cullei might occur. The reference to the <b>punishment</b> <b>is</b> in connection with Cicero's (historically correct, and successful) endeavours to acquit Sextus Roscius of the charge of having murdered his own father.|$|E
5|$|Capital <b>punishment</b> <b>is</b> {{legal in}} Singapore. The number of {{judicial}} executions has fluctuated widely depending on crime rates; {{at its highest}} point, according to unofficial statistics compiled by Amnesty International, about 408 people were hanged between 1991 and 2003; at its lowest point in 2010, none were executed. Between 2004 and 2011, the number of executions varied between none and 10. Hanging, which is used for all executions and are carried out in Changi Prison on Fridays at dawn, are by the long drop method, which severs the spinal cord.|$|E

50|$|Criminal {{responsibility}} is considered personal, therefore collective <b>punishments</b> <b>are</b> not recognized. A defendant is considered {{innocent until proven}} guilty, and <b>punishments</b> <b>are</b> aimed at the rehabilitation of the convicted. The death penalty and cruel and unusual <b>punishments</b> <b>are</b> prohibited. Extradition of citizens is not permitted outside of those cases provided by international conventions, and is prohibited for political offences.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from the}} death penalty, the {{remaining}} four <b>Punishments</b> for Slaves <b>were</b> designed to bring about damage to their bodies that would mark them for life. All ordinary citizens were subjected to these <b>punishments.</b> These <b>punishments</b> <b>were</b> for men.

5|$|Persona 2: Eternal <b>Punishment</b> <b>is</b> a {{role-playing}} {{game where}} the player takes {{control of a}} group of characters exploring the fictional city of Sumaru. The camera follows the party from an adjustable angled overhead perspective. The city in general is navigated using an overworld map. A key element to the story and gameplay is the Rumor system: after the characters hear a rumor, they can spread that rumor around the city using certain characters, and those rumors can grant the characters special items or other positive or negative effects.|$|E
5|$|Augustine {{believed}} that a physical Hell exists, but that physical <b>punishment</b> <b>is</b> secondary to the punishment of being separated from God. He proposed two reasons for this: Firstly, humans have free will, and only those who choose to follow God will be forgiven and able to avoid Hell. Secondly, he {{believed that}} Adam and Eve's choice to sin affected our free choice, and that humans are left unable to resist sin. Augustine proposed that the grace of Jesus Christ freed humans from original sin, but he maintained that humans can only be saved {{if they choose to}} receive grace, and that this choice is formed by the character of individual humans. Accepting that even those who will be saved continue to sin, Augustine proposed that those who choose God's grace will still go to Hell for a time to purge them of their sin, before going to Heaven.|$|E
5|$|Capital <b>punishment</b> <b>is</b> sanctioned in the United States {{for certain}} federal and {{military}} crimes, {{and used in}} 31 states. No executions took place from 1967 to 1977, owing {{in part to a}} U.S. Supreme Court ruling striking down arbitrary imposition of the death penalty. In 1976, that Court ruled that, under appropriate circumstances, capital punishment may constitutionally be imposed. Since the decision there have been more than 1,300 executions, a majority of these taking place in three states: Texas, Virginia, and Oklahoma. Meanwhile, several states have either abolished or struck down death penalty laws. In 2015, the country had the fifth-highest number of executions in the world, following China, Iran, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.|$|E
50|$|The {{last time}} capital <b>punishment</b> <b>was</b> {{enforced}} in peacetime is in 1825 (see: Tahvo Putkonen). In the Finnish Civil War (1918) {{and in the}} wars of World War II (1939-1945) capital <b>punishment</b> <b>was</b> enforced. The death penalty was abolished in 1971.|$|R
50|$|With {{respect to}} the {{cooperation}} norms violations (prisoner's dilemma), {{it has been shown}} that second-party <b>punishments</b> <b>are</b> consistently higher than third-party punishments for defectors. The <b>punishments</b> <b>were</b> such that the defectors could still profit in the third-party conditions, but could not profit in the second-party conditions. <b>Punishment</b> for cooperators <b>were</b> negligible under both conditions.|$|R

5|$|On Rubicun III, the Edo {{explain to}} Lt. Tasha Yar (Denise Crosby) and Worf that capital <b>punishment</b> <b>is</b> used to enforce their laws. The away team rush to warn Wesley, only to {{discover}} he has accidentally broken a greenhouse while playing catch with the Edo youths. An Edo policeman attempts to give Wesley a lethal injection for this infraction of the law, but Yar and Worf draw their phasers. On the ship, the sphere leaves Data's body and departs. Picard, upon hearing of the situation with Wesley, transports to the surface. He meets {{with representatives of the}} Edo in a council chamber and explains that Earth no longer practices capital punishment. Some Edo interpret this stance as an attempt by the Federation to push their superiority and suggest that Picard should mount a rescue effort for the boy. He says he cannot, quoting the Prime Directive.|$|E
5|$|The Megans are {{determined}} to put humanity and the Enterprise crew on trial for what humans did to their people during the Salem witch-trials as well as Lucien for bringing them here. Kirk comes out in support of Lucien's life and says that killing him would make the Megans just like humans. Lucien's <b>punishment</b> <b>is</b> to be condemned into limbo for eternity for bringing humans into the Megans' world. While Kirk states that humanity has progressed infinitely since 1691, the Megans ignore his words. At {{the end of the}} trial, Kirk offers his life to save Lucien's and the Megans are so impressed by the captain's gesture that they spare Lucien, and tell the Enterprise that they would welcome future human visits to their planet. They also return the Enterprise to its proper universe, while Lucien is revealed to be Lucifer.|$|E
5|$|The {{number and}} names of hells, {{as well as}} the type of sinners sent to a {{particular}} hell, varies from text to text; however, many scriptures describe 28 hells. After death, messengers of Yama called Yamadutas bring all beings to the court of Yama, where he weighs the virtues and the vices of the being and passes a judgement, sending the virtuous to Svarga (heaven) and the sinners to one of the hells. The stay in Svarga or Naraka is generally described as temporary. After the quantum of <b>punishment</b> <b>is</b> over, the souls are reborn as lower or higher beings as per their merits. In a few texts, hell is described as a bottomless pit of darkness where souls are trapped for eternity and deprived of rebirth.|$|E
50|$|With {{respect to}} the {{distribution}} norms violations (dictator games), {{it has been shown}} that second-party <b>punishments</b> <b>are</b> consistently higher than third-party punishments for dictators that choose to share less than half of their endowment. The <b>punishments</b> <b>were</b> such that the dictators could still profit from giving less than half in the third-party conditions, but could not profit in the second-party conditions. The levels of <b>punishment</b> <b>were</b> consistently low for both second and third-party punishments if the levels of endowment were higher than half.|$|R
40|$|Pigeons were punished {{with mild}} shock for pecking {{during one of}} two {{components}} of a multiple schedule. They eventually recovered so that they pecked {{at the same rate}} during both components. In one experiment they were extinguished after recovering. When <b>punishment</b> <b>was</b> maintained during extinction, they extinguished faster during the punished, than during the unpunished component. When <b>punishment</b> <b>was</b> stopped during extinction, they extinguished faster during the unpunished than during the previously punished component. In another experiment, <b>punishment</b> <b>was</b> programmed first during neither of the two components, then during one, then during both, and finally during the other component. The extent of recovery decreased with each successive cycle. It is concluded that, if transient emotional states are ignored, reward and <b>punishment</b> <b>are</b> symmetrical in their effects...|$|R

5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, Mulder and Scully investigate the Church of God with Signs and Wonders, a church where the Bible is read literally, and <b>punishment</b> <b>is</b> dealt deftly, after a small town church {{is the site of}} a number of ritualistic-like murders. But soon the agents realize that the difference between the peaceful religious and the fanatics may not be very much at all.|$|E
5|$|In Stage six (universal ethical {{principles}} driven), moral reasoning {{is based on}} abstract reasoning using universal {{ethical principles}}. Laws are valid only insofar as they are grounded in justice, {{and a commitment to}} justice carries with it an obligation to disobey unjust laws. Legal rights are unnecessary, as social contracts are not essential for deontic moral action. Decisions are not reached hypothetically in a conditional way but rather categorically in an absolute way, as in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant. This involves an individual imagining what they would do in another’s shoes, if they believed what that other person imagines to be true. The resulting consensus is the action taken. In this way action is never a means but always an end in itself; the individual acts because it is right, and not because it avoids <b>punishment,</b> <b>is</b> in their best interest, expected, legal, or previously agreed upon. Although Kohlberg insisted that stage six exists, he found it difficult to identify individuals who consistently operated at that level.|$|E
5|$|Outside their tree house, Finn and Jake snooze, while BMO (Niki Yang) and N.E.P.T.R. (Andy Milonakis) {{play out}} a spoof of Robin Hood and the Sheriff of Nottingham. The two break open Finn and Jake's {{treasure}} room, pouring their massive stash of gold {{out into the}} yard, {{as well as the}} Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant (Steve Agee). BMO talks Finn into spending the money at an expensive resort at Wildberry Kingdom. When they arrive in the town square, Jake unloads their treasure into the city's fountain. A guard scolds them for this, but they bribe him with a few shillings and a crown, freeing them from the law. Chaos follows shortly after Jake uses wealth to control the residents. When they disrespect her authority, Wildberry Princess (Maria Bamford) orders Finn and Jake to be arrested and for their money to be seized and melted down. Her <b>punishment</b> <b>is</b> for them to be covered in the molten gold, but BMO and N.E.P.T.R. arrive just in time and save the two.|$|E
