The entire program is privately funded by members and supporters of The Planetary Society, the world’s largest nonprofit space advocacy organization. Spacecraft design started in 2009; {{by the end of}} 2011 both spacecraft had largely been built but not fully tested, and neither had a firm launch commitment. Following an 18 -month <b>program</b> <b>pause</b> during 2012 - 2013, the effort was resumed after launch opportunities had been secured for each spacecraft. The first LightSail spacecraft—dedicated primarily to demonstrating the solar sail deployment process—was launched into Earth orbit on 2015 May 20 as a secondary payload aboard an Atlas 5 rocket, and on June 9 mission success was declared. The mission plan for the second LightSail includes demonstration of solar sailing in Earth orbit, among other objectives. It is on track for a launch in 2016 aboard a Falcon Heavy rocket as a key element of the Prox- 1 mission. Lessons learned from the 2015 test mission will be applied to the 2016 mission, and lessons from both LightSail missions will inform planned NASA solar sail-based CubeSat missions and hopefully enhance their chances for mission success...|$|E

40|$|Accurate and {{complete}} DNA replication {{is fundamental to}} maintain genome integrity. While the mechanisms and underlying machinery required to duplicate bulk genomic DNA are beginning to emerge, {{little is known about}} how cells replicate through damaged areas and special chromosomal regions such as telomeres, centromeres, and highly transcribed loci [1]. Here, we have investigated the role of the yeast cullin Rtt 101 p in this process. We show that rtt 101 Δ cells accumulate spontaneous DNA damage and exhibit a G 2 /M delay, even though they are fully proficient to detect and repair chromosome breaks. Viability of rtt 101 Δ mutants depends on Rrm 3 p, a DNA helicase involved in displacing proteinaceous complexes at <b>programmed</b> <b>pause</b> sites [2]. Moreover, rtt 101 Δ cells show hyperrecombination at forks arrested at replication fork barriers (RFBs) of ribosomal DNA. Finally, rtt 101 Δ mutants are sensitive to fork arrest induced by DNA alkylation, but not by nucleotide depletion. We therefore propose that the cullin Rtt 101 p promotes fork progression through obstacles such as DNA lesions or tightly bound protein-DNA complexes via a new mechanism involving ubiquitin-conjugation...|$|R

This fork pausing {{is required}} to initiate a recombination event that switches mating type. Swi 1 is also needed for the replication checkpoint that arrests division in response to fork arrest. How Swi 1 accomplishes these tasks is unknown. Here we report that Swi 1 copurifies with a 181 -amino-acid protein encoded by swi 3 +. The Swi 1 -Swi 3 complex {{is required for}} survival of fork arrest and for activation of the replication checkpoint kinase Cds 1. Association of Swi 1 and Swi 3 with chromatin during DNA replication correlated with movement of the replication fork. swi 1 Δ and swi 3 Δ mutants accumulated Rad 22 (Rad 52 homolog) DNA repair foci during replication. These foci correlated with the Rad 22 -dependent appearance of Holliday junction (HJ) -like structures in cells lacking Mus 81 -Eme 1 HJ resolvase. Rhp 51 and Rhp 54 homologous recombination proteins were not required for viability in swi 1 Δ or swi 3 Δ cells, indicating that the HJ-like structures arise from single-strand DNA gaps or rearranged forks instead of broken forks. We propose that Swi 1 and Swi 3 define a fork protection complex that coordinates leading- and lagging-strand synthesis and stabilizes stalled replication forks...|$|R

40|$|IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) is an {{architectural}} framework for delivering IP multimedia to fixed and mobile users. IMS promises {{to facilitate the}} blending of quad-play services (voice, video, TV and mobility) in interactive, personalized ways. Delivery of a quad-play bundle, with one monthly-bill, is a highly desirable objective for service providers of all types – especially wireline operators. Such an offering would allow service providers to achieve a higher ARPU (average revenue per user), reduce customer churn, and win new subscribers. As we will see, the IMS architecture also offers the ability to reduce OPEX (operating expenses) and {{is a means of}} rapidly deploying new and unique combinations of services. If the quad-play components were merely bundled together as four discrete services, providers could only compete on price – a no-win situation. Instead, while continuing to supply high-quality voice, video and data services that subscribers are accustomed to, they must offer features that blend IPTV with other services, such as presence, instant messaging and telephony applications. The number of combinations is potentially limitless. Some of the possibilities include: � Mobile TV – the ability to watch your favorite TV programs on your home set, cell phone, PC or laptop. � TV telephony – the ability to receive a phone call while watching TV. The <b>program</b> would <b>pause</b> and display caller ID information and allow you to choose to take the call or refer it to voice mail. � IM with TV – the ability to communicate with friends and colleagues about a program you’re both watching. � Remote DVR – the ability to program your DVR remotely to record programs that you might miss, and then to play them back via Mobile TV.

40|$|Efficient {{and safe}} memory {{management}} {{is a hard}} problem. Garbage collection promises automatic memory management but comes {{with the cost of}} increased memory footprint, reduced parallelism in multi-threaded <b>programs,</b> unpredictable <b>pause</b> time, and intricate tuning parameters balancing the program's workload and designated memory usage in order for an application to perform reasonably well. Existing research mitigates the above problems to some extent, but programmer error could still cause memory leak by erroneously keeping memory references when they are no longer needed. We need a methodology for programmers to become resource aware, so that efficient, scalable, predictable and high performance programs may be written without the fear of resource leak. Linear logic has been recognized as the formalism of choice for resource tracking. It requires explicit introduction and elimination of resources and guarantees that a resource cannot be implicitly shared or abandoned, hence must be linear. Early languages based on linear logic focused on Curry-Howard correspondence. They began by limiting the expressive powers of the language and then reintroduced them by allowing controlled sharing which is necessary for recursive functions. However, only by deviating from Curry-Howard correspondence could later development actually address programming errors in resource usage. The contribution of this dissertation is a simple, safe, and efficient approach introducing linear resource ownership semantics into C++ (which is still a widely used language after 30 years since inception) through linear pointer, a smart pointer inspired by linear logic. By implementing various linear data structures and a parallel, multi-threaded memory allocator based on these data structures, this work shows that linear pointer is practical and efficient in the real world, and {{that it is possible to}} build a memory management stack that is entirely leak free. The dissertation offers some closing remarks on the difficulties a formal system would encounter when reasoning about a concurrent linear data algorithm, and what might be done to solve these problems...|$|R
5000|$|Some debuggers allow {{registers}} {{or program}} variables in memory {{to be modified}} before resuming, effectively allowing the introduction of [...] "hand-coded" [...] temporary assignments for test purposes. Similarly, program instructions can often be skipped {{to determine the effect}} of changes to the program logic - enabling questions about program execution to be answered in a direct way (i.e. without assumptions or guesswork). In many cases it may be the only practical method of testing obscure [...] "event-driven" [...] error subroutines that rarely, if ever, get executed - without the added risk of leaving temporary source changes. Manually changing the resume location within a <b>paused</b> <b>program</b> can be used to enter an otherwise rarely executed section of code (such as a specific hardware condition handler). Implementing data breakpoints in software however, can greatly reduce the performance of the application being debugged - since it is using additional resources on the same processor. However, this is normally acceptable during testing and the amount of information available from the debugger is not restricted by limitations of debug data known to the hardware. For instance, a software implementation can collect logical path data at program/subroutine/instruction level to considerably augment what might be stored by the particular hardware platform for inspection. The instruction set simulation method considerably reduces the overhead, compared to the (repeated) instruction replacement method, also reducing cache misses.|$|R
50|$|The player uses simple {{commands}} {{to create a}} list of instructions to perform the given task. Such commands include picking up the first item at the inbox, placing the item the avatar is currently carrying at the outbox, copying the carried item to a marked square, performing addition or subtraction of the carried item with the item at the marked square, and making decisions based {{on the value of}} the carried item such as if it is zero or negative. As such, these mimic the elements of assembly language: the simple instructions equivalent to opcodes, the ability of the avatar to hold an item mirroring a processor register, and the spaces on the office floor representing main memory. Later, the player gains the ability to use the concept of memory addresses, in which they can direct instructions to operate on a specific floor space that is labeled with the number of a different floor space. The visual approach to the language also allows the player to place simple handdrawn notes as labels in both the list of instructions or to label floor spaces for clarity. The loops and jump commands are also marked with arrows to help the player identify the logic flow. Once they have created the program, they can run it through, increasing the speed for longer <b>programs,</b> or <b>pause</b> and move step by step for debugging purposes. If the outbox received any boxes it is not expected for that program, the program will immediately terminate and the player will need {{to figure out how to}} correct it.

40|$|An {{important}} {{focus of}} the Social Welfare Research Centre's work on the welfare of elderly people has been non-institutional care; formal care provided by statutory services, and informal care provided by family members. This report {{is the first in}} a planned series to look at one specific formal service, the Home Help service, in relation to elderly people. In the context of theoretical and practical issues relating to the development of home support services, this study examines Home Help service structures across Australia and, in particular, the workings of the service in New South Wales. Data for the study were collected in 1981 / 82, a time when financial and administrative constraints were markedly restricting the range and amount of home help which could be provided. In New South Wales, where the most information was gathered, the service was facing important challenges in terms of its development into a more comprehensive, caring service but was being hampered by lack of funds. Over the last three years the Home Care Service of New South Wales has experienced a continuous process of change and development. Funding in this period has increased by 187 per cent, total staff by 20 per cent and the number of branches by 5 per cent. Pay rates for field staff have risen by 46 per cent, and a long battle through the industrial courts has been in progress to develop an award. The most recent State budget (1983 / 84) provided for an increase of 107 per cent in funding of the New South Wales Home Care Service. This has allowed the introduction of needs based allocation of funds, the further development of innovative services and an upgrading of the administrative capacities of branches. The flexibility of branches in planning their expenditure has increased with the introduction of funding of all branches under a system of four monthly blocks compared with four weekly funding under which many branches in our study operated. The Wages <b>Pause</b> <b>Program</b> has also provided 'seeding' resources for an Assessment Program designed to assist branch staff in the development of effective assessment/re-assessment procedures. A training program, established centrally, since the time of our study, has become {{an important part of the}} service, with a budget of $ 0. 5 million for 1983 / 84. Funding changes have meant that the Home Care Service has been able to develop the services it offers for all groups, including non-elderly people. For example, an affirmative action program for disabled people has been designed to ensure that the Service is accessible and appropriate to their needs. The already existing live-in housekeeper program has been extended to provide assistance to families in crisis and to offer extended respite care. Although recent increases in funding have expanded the potential of the service to meet the home care needs of the community, it is clear that even more resources will be needed if this is to be done completely. Many important issues regarding the allocation of home help resources at both the geographic and client level have been raised in this report...|$|R
