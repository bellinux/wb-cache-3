40|$|In this work, a {{dry powder}} nano-in-microparticle (NiM) vaccine {{formulation}} {{was developed by}} using a very gentle two-step-production method involving, first, an ionic gelation step to achieve primary nanoparticles followed by a spray drying step to gain the final dry powder vaccine formulation. The biopolymer chitosan was chosen as adjuvant and particle forming excipient because of its mucoadhesive and adjuvant properties. At first, different chitosan qualities were analysed {{with respect to their}} polymer properties like the molecular weight and the degree of deacetylation. Subsequently, an in vivo study (in cooperation with the University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand) was conducted in order to evaluate the adjuvant activity of three different chitosan qualities after s. c. administration. For this, two of the chitosans used were spray dried prior to the application and then administered as PBS soluble hydrochloride salts, the third quality was used as received and thus given as a PBS chitosan suspension. All three qualities were given together with the model antigen ovalbumin and also without it as placebo formulations. As a result of this study Chitosan from Sigma was identified as the chitosan with the highest adjuvant activity. Parallel to this study, a nanoparticle production method was developed. For this, chitosan was dissolved in acidic medium and then the bile salt derivative sodium deoxycholate was added under stirring to induce the gelation process. A method was developed to obtain nanoparticles with about 250 nm in diameter. Particles of this size are known to be taken up well by DCs specialised cells, called M-cells, which are located in the mucosal membranes. Particulate antigens induce both a strong systemic and also a local immune response on the mucosal membranes. The nanoparticles were combined with two model antigens, bovine serum albumin and ovalbumin, that were associated with the particles during the particle forming process. The particle forming process was further investigated regarding the relationship between the pH value of the chitosan solution and the resulting particle size as well as the antigen loading efficiency. These experiments were performed in order to enable the user to produce tailored particles in the different size ranges, if desired. In addition, the influence of the molecular weight of the polymer {{on the size of the}} generated particles was analysed. After that, freeze and spray drying with different stabilising excipients were examined in order to transfer the nanosuspension into a dry powder formulation being capable for direct respiratory administration. Finally, it was found that adding a 10 % mannitol solution to the nanosuspension followed by spray drying led to the best dry powder NiM formulation regarding handling and powder properties. Subsequently, protein stability in the final formulation was verified using SDS-PAGE and circular dichroism analysis. The results showed that the antigen (OVA) was not affected by the production process. The obtained powder was further analysed regarding its deposition profile inside the nasal cavity of adults and children using two nasal cast models and a nasal <b>powder</b> <b>dispenser.</b> In order to determine the respirable fraction the Twin Stage Glass Impinger with two dry powder inhalers were used. Obtained data showed that the nasal deposition of the NiM formulation inside the adults nasal cast model was satisfactory, while, due to the anatomy, the amount of NiM formulation deposited in the anterior regions of the child model was unacceptably high and thus the obtained deposition profile failed to match the desired one. Regarding the pulmonary delivery it was found that the produced powder showed a very high capsule and device retention. This problem was solved by adding 1 % magnesium stearate to the spray dried powder and blending for 3 h. Nevertheless, the resulting respirable fraction remained little too low. Finally, a second in vivo as well as another in vitro study were performed. In these studies the produced NiM formulation was administered intranasally to mice and the immune response measured as expression of CD 4 + and CD 8 + transgenic (OVA specific) cells was analysed via flow cytometry. In addition, the cell toxicity and the cellular uptake of the NiM formulation were investigated. In these studies it was found that the NiM formulation was taken up by dendritic cells in a satisfactory extent of about 50 %. Unfortunately, the magnitude of the immune response induced by the NiM formulation was rather modest and not significantly higher than those induced by the antigen-free placebo NiM formulation. Based on the obtained results, in future work it should be examined if a second adjuvant can be added to the existing formulation in order to increase the immune response. This new formulation should then be tested again in an in vivo study regarding its immunological potential. In order to ensure to induce an appropriate immune response in further studies the amount of antigen in the formulation should also be increased to about 2 %. But for this, the NiM formulation which was developed in this work is certainly a good basis for further development and optimisatio...|$|E

40|$|Plodia interpunctella (Hübner) {{is a major}} pest of raw and {{processed}} stored food products {{and the purpose of}} this work was to design and determine whether an entomopathogen based autodissemination approach would be an efficacious product for its control. A comparison of the retention, horizontal transmission and effect on mating of two electrostatic entomopathogen delivery powders (Entomag™ and Entostat™) was made to evaluate their potential as a component of an autodissemination method for the control of P. interpunctella. Both powders were shown to have some effects on mating behaviour and ability of treated males to locate a pheromone source when applied in high doses. However, no effects were observed at rates consistent with the amount of powder that was actually taken up when the moths visited a prototype bait station device. Male and females lost 69. 9 and 64. 3 % by weight respectively of Entomag by 48 h after exposure but lost more Entostat, 89. 8 % and 75. 9 %, over the same period. Critical to the efficacy of autodissemination is the transfer of powder from males to females and on average a 49 % greater weight of Entostat was transferred than Entomag. In addition to this the electrostatic charge on each powder was measured, with Entostat charging significantly more (to the negative polarity) than Entomag. The respective distances that a charged particle could levitate by virtue of electrostatic forces to an insect, were modelled, with Entostat predicted as levitating over a greater distance to the moth than Entomag under scenarios where the insect was either neutral or charged (neutral particle = 2. 8 mm, compared to 1. 9 mm; charged particle = 21. 7 mm, compared to 6. 8 mm). A novel technique for determining powder uptake by P. interpuncetlla was developed based on image analysis. This determined the regions of the moth’s body to which particles were more likely to adhere. This study confirmed that pit-fall style <b>powder</b> <b>dispensers</b> were more effective at delivering powder {{to the head of the}} moth, where powder appeared to be most readily horizontally transferred between conspecifics. Finally, an individual based modelling approach was taken to determine the overall suitability of Beauveria bassiana autodissemination as a controlling strategy for P. interpunctella. The model suggested that a maximum of only 62 % of male moths would become contaminated with entomopathogen and that this would be insufficient to cause a decline in the overall population.

Adults of O. cornifrons were self-marked with chicken egg-white protein <b>powder</b> from a <b>dispenser</b> nest box placed {{at the center of}} the study orchard at early bloom. Flower samples were collected from randomly selected trees (n[*]=[*] 30) located at different distances from the nest box. Flowers were analyzed for the presence of immunomarker protein with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Foraging patterns were determined by measuring the distance and direction of marked flowers from the nest box. While marked flowers were found out to 55  m (maximum distance sampled), most marked flowers were found within 35  m from the nest and the percentage of marked flowers declined rapidly beyond that distance. Fruit density per limb cross-sectional area (cm 2) in the study orchard was significantly higher than in the orchard without O. cornifrons, indicating the value of O. cornifrons as pollinators in increasing fruit yield in tart cherries...|$|R

The report {{is a part of}} a Bachelor thesis project for graduates of science in mechanical engineering. Technogarden Engineering Resources AB is a technical consulting firm in Karlstad who has been commissioned by the client JPRT Förvaltning AB to develop a separate accessory for a gruel machine that helps consumers to facilitate the dispensing of baby formula powder in its powder magazine. This includes a design engineering process with focus on product development, including project management, concept generation, designing, material selection, prototype manufacturing and evalution. The work is divided into choice of material for the finished product were mechanical properties, environmental impact and health effects are criterias of decision. Selection of concepts was done by examining similar designs, generate possible concepts and objectively proceed with the most appropriate concept to design. Designing the product is made using 3 D CAD which later serves as model for prototyping using a 3 D printer which manufactures the prototype of plastic material. The finished prototype is evaluated to find improvements in design and present this to the client for further design complements. The prototype resulted in a functional design which requires further detail design for ease of manufacturing and assembly. Further investigation such as material samples and invoice from suppliers is needed before the construction can be put into production. Since the product will be used with food, it needs to be CE approved and choice of materials must be in compliance with the European Commission Regulation (EC) No 10 / 2011 for products made of plastics that are intended to be in contact with food. The design must meet the requirements and some of the demands from the product specification established together with the client. Some of the requirements that must be met is that the container must hold a certain amount of baby formula powder, which the designed is dimensioned after. The amount of powder dispensed by this design is calculated by the volume of the powder magazine. Since this design is intended for a consumer market, effort has been put into create an attractive product that can be recognized along with the gruel machine that it is intended to use with. Ergonomics has been a factor included while designing in this project and even more work can be done in this area for further improvements. ...|$|R
