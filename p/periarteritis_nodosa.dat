40|$|THE {{association}} of renal lesions with <b>periarteritis</b> <b>nodosa</b> {{has been known}} {{since the publication of}} the first comprehensive description of the disease by Kussmaul and Maier (1866). The frequency of renal involvement has been stated to be 73 per cent, of cases (Gruber, 1925), 80 per cent, of cases (Arkin, 1930), and 87 per cent, of cases (Harris, Lynch, and O'Hare, 1939). Gruber's review of 108 cases from the literature shows that while multiple renal infarcts were a common finding, there were also cases in which diffuse changes in the renal parenchyma were present, and these were usually described as one or other form of nephritis. In the literature before and since Gruber's paper, opinions have varied as to the relation of these parenchymal changes to the <b>periarteritis</b> <b>nodosa.</b> Thus, Ophuls (1923) believed that the diffuse nephritis seen in <b>periarteritis</b> <b>nodosa</b> was an unrelated coincidental lesion, yet Kroetz (1921) thought that the same factor that involved the renal arteries was also the cause of the nephritic lesions. Meyer (1921) could not decide whether the nephritic lesions were secondary to the vascular involvement or directly due to a hypothetical toxic factor. Gray (1929) argued that the nephritic lesions were secondary to involvement of arterioles by <b>periarteritis</b> <b>nodosa.</b> Grant (1940) held that the renal changes were primary manifestations of <b>periarteritis</b> <b>nodosa</b> and not those of an independent glomerulonephritis.

40|$|International audienceRenal {{involvement}} of systemic vasculitides {{is an emergency}} in nephrology. Although it has become very rare, the diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa {{must be considered in}} some patients. A 70 -year-old patient, previously healthy, presented with acute renal failure and malignant hypertension and abundant albuminuria. Subcutaneous nodule, orchitis and mononeuritis appeared subsequently. The search for auto-immunity or viral infection was negative. Markers of thrombotic microangiopathy, present initially, resolved after blood pressure control. After a renal computed tomography with contrast medium injection was considered normal, without any micro-aneurysm, a renal biopsy was performed. It showed vascular lesions and glomerular ischemia. It was complicated by hemorragic shock after 36 hours. The diagnosis of <b>periarteritis</b> <b>nodosa</b> was finally made after arterial angiography showed millimetric renal micro-aneurysms.

In all these cases histologic changes found in the liver varied from "minimal" to chronic aggressive hepatitis. In all the cases, deposits of HBsAg, immunoglobulins, beta 1 C-globulin and C 1 q were detected in vascular lesions. That these deposits could represent HBsAg-anti-HBs immune complexes was supported by demonstrating their strong binding of guinea pig complement and by the successful elution of all HBsAg {{and part of the}} immunoglobulin from these deposits by treatment with buffers known to dissociate antigen-antibody bonds but not with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7. 6 (PBS). Glomerulonephritis associated with these immune complexes was found in 6 cases. The presence of larger masses of HBsAg immune complexes, chiefly in recent insudative and fibrinoid vascular lesions, their lesser amounts in lesions undergoing involution, and their absence from healed lesions strongly suggest that these complexes play a primary role in the pathogenesis of acute vascular damage in <b>periarteritis</b> <b>nodosa...</b>|$|E
40|$|Earlier {{experiments}} {{have shown that}} treatment with methylandrostenediol (MAD) results in the accumulation of hyalin granules in the adrenocortical cells.

It had also been found that adrenalectomy prevents all these effects of MAD. The present experiments on rats show that, {{in the absence of the}} thyroid, the production by this steroid of hyalin granules in the adrenals is diminished but not abolished.

Historical Perspectives and Classification The earliest classification of vasculitis was that of Zeek in 1952; who reviewed the litera-turefrom 1886 to 1952.

40|$|The first animal case of <b>periarteritis</b> <b>nodosa</b> in Japan was reported. The {{case was}} a 6 -year-old cow of Japanese black breed, and its chief {{symptoms}} were emaciation, groaning, tachypnea, accentuation of heart sounds and tenderness at the cardiac region. As {{a result of the}} pathological examination, a typical lesion of <b>periarteritis</b> <b>nodosa</b> was found in all organs examined. The affected arterioles showed nodular and funicular thickening macroscopically, and the arteritic lesions in all stages of development were found microscopically. These lesions were classified in the following 4 stages; (1) degenerative stage (fibrinoid degeneration and edema of the arterial wall), (2) acute inflammatory stage (marked cellular infiltration together with fibrinoid degeneration and the destruction of elastic laminae), (3) granulation tissue stage (granulation tissue formation in and around the arterial wall and intimal proliferation), and (4) healed granulation tissue stage (progressive fibrosis of the arterial wall). The changes of earlier stages were not so common as those of later stages. As findings other than the arteritic lesion, chronic vesicular emphysema and focal atelectasis of the lungs, hypertrophy of the myocardium, edema and hyaline degeneration of the skeletal muscles and focal amyloidosis of the liver and portal lymph node were observed.

It has been noted by DuBois x that it is sometimes possible to alter the statistical incidence of rare diseases by training a hospital staff to become conscious of a disease syndrome and on the alert to diagnose the ailment early when, presumably, treatment may be effective. He cites the case of disseminated lupus erythematosus. Considered a rarity, {{the diagnosis}} was made 11 times in the Los Angeles County General Hospital in the years 1948 and 1949. However, in the following two years, after the hospital staff became alert to the existence of systemic lupus, and checked obscure but pos-sible cases by the use of the blood test devised by Hargraves 2 for lupus erythemato-sus cells (the so-called L. E. cells), a total of 44 cases was diagnosed. This put the disease above Hodgkin's and pernicious anemia in relapse in statistical fre-quency. Neither of these diseases is generally considered rare in the hospital population. The following account of a case of periarteritis (also a collagen disease) is re-ported for two reasons: First, to stimulate increased alertness to the syndrome.
