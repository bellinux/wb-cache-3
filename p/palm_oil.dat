40|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>palm</b> {{is one of}} the world’s most rapidly {{expanding}} crops, replacing humid forests across tropical regions. Studies examining the effect of this land conversion on biodiversity have tended to focus predominantly on Southeast Asia, where the majority of the world’s <b>oil</b> <b>palm</b> is produced. Because the Amazon possesses the greatest area of suitable land for <b>oil</b> <b>palm</b> expansion, <b>oil</b> <b>palm</b> is considered an emerging threat to Amazonian biodiversity.

We used mist nets to conduct avifaunal surveys of forest and <b>oil</b> <b>palm</b> habitat in the Pucallpa region of Peruvian Amazonia.

5|$|As of 1993, {{there were}} 40 timber-processing plants {{and a number}} of sawmills. Tawau Port is a major export and import gateway for timber {{especially}} from North Kalimantan. A barter trade has been formalised between East Kalimantan (now North Kalimantan) and Sabah with the creation of Tawau Barter Trade Association (BATS) in 1993. The association handles the cash-based trade of raw materials from Indonesia, but in recent years has focussed on timber industry.

40|$|Abstract: The {{effect of}} {{fermented}} melon seed oil (Citrullus lanatus) (Ogiri) and <b>palm</b> kernel <b>oil</b> on the plasma lipid profile of female albino rats were investigated. Rats {{were randomly assigned}} into three groups and fed diet composed with fermented melon seed <b>oil,</b> <b>palm</b> kernel <b>oil</b> and control diet for seven weeks. After the feeding trial, plasma total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly higher (p< 0. 05) than control in <b>palm</b> kernel <b>oil</b> diet while {{there was no significant}} difference in high density lipoprotein cholesterol. In contrast, the total cholesterol and high density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly higher (p< 0. 5) than control while the low density lipoprotein cholesterol was significantly lower (p< 0. 05) in the fermented melon seed oil diet. The Ogiri oil diet had significantly reduced LDL/HDL ratio compared with the control while the <b>palm</b> kernel <b>oil</b> diet had a higher LDL/HDL ratio.
