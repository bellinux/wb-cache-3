5|$|According to Mendelian inheritance, {{variations}} in an organism's phenotype (observable physical and behavioral characteristics) are {{due in part}} to {{variations in}} its genotype (<b>particular</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> genes). Each gene specifies a particular trait with different sequence of a gene (alleles) giving rise to different phenotypes. Most eukaryotic organisms (such as the pea plants Mendel worked on) have two alleles for each trait, one inherited from each parent.|$|E
5|$|George Mackey {{had asked}} whether Born's rule is a {{necessary}} consequence of a <b>particular</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> axioms for quantum mechanics, and more specifically whether every measure on the lattice of projections of a Hilbert space can be defined by a positive operator with unit trace. Though Richard Kadison proved this was false for two-dimensional Hilbert spaces, Gleason's theorem (published 1957) shows {{it to be true}} for higher dimensions.|$|E

5|$|An {{intuitive}} {{understanding of}} X-ray diffraction {{can be obtained}} from the Bragg model of diffraction. In this model, a given reflection is associated with a set of evenly spaced sheets running through the crystal, usually passing through the centers of the atoms of the crystal lattice. The orientation of a <b>particular</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> sheets is identified by its three Miller indices (h, k, l), and let their spacing be noted by d. William Lawrence Bragg proposed a model in which the incoming X-rays are scattered specularly (mirror-like) from each plane; from that assumption, X-rays scattered from adjacent planes will combine constructively (constructive interference) when the angle θ between the plane and the X-ray results in a path-length difference that is an integer multiple n of the X-ray wavelength λ.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, other {{proteins}} {{have evolved}} to bind to particular DNA sequences. The most intensively studied of these are the various transcription factors, which are proteins that regulate transcription. Each transcription factor binds to one <b>particular</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> DNA sequences and activates or inhibits the transcription of genes that have these sequences close to their promoters. The transcription factors do this in two ways. Firstly, they can bind the RNA polymerase responsible for transcription, either directly or through other mediator proteins; this locates the polymerase at the promoter and allows it to begin transcription. Alternatively, transcription factors can bind enzymes that modify the histones at the promoter. This changes the accessibility of the DNA template to the polymerase.|$|E
5|$|The story tracks Joule Adams, one of {{the first}} volunteers for the utopian colony of Far Eden, who wakes after centuries in cryo-sleep to find that nothing has gone {{according}} to plan. With her three robotic machines known as corebot companions, Joule ventures throughout Far Eden to uncover the secrets behind the failed mission. The open world environment of Far Eden is subject to exploration and the collection of resources. Joule's weapons are color-coded to inflict damage on a <b>particular</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> enemies and, like her companions, can also be enhanced. The corebots support her in battle and puzzle solving.|$|E

5|$|Andrei Kolmogorov {{developed}} in a 1931 paper {{a large part of}} the early theory of continuous-time Markov processes. Kolmogorov was partly inspired by Louis Bachelier's 1900 work on fluctuations in the stock market as well as Norbert Wiener's work on Einstein's model of Brownian movement. He introduced and studied a <b>particular</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> Markov processes known as diffusion processes, where he derived a set of differential equations describing the processes. Independent of Kolmgorov's work, Sydney Chapman derived in a 1928 paper an equation, now called the Chapman–Kolmogorov equation, in a less mathematically rigorous way than Kolmogorov, while studying Brownian movement. The differential equations are now called the Kolmogorov equations or the Kolmogorov–Chapman equations. Other mathematicians who contributed significantly to the foundations of Markov processes include William Feller, starting in the 1930s, and then later Eugene Dynkin, starting in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|One <b>particular</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> {{observations}} {{is related}} to eminently useful practical applications, namely to satellite navigation systems such as the Global Positioning System that are used both for precise positioning and timekeeping. Such systems rely on two sets of atomic clocks: clocks aboard satellites orbiting the Earth, and reference clocks stationed on the Earth's surface. General relativity predicts that these two sets of clocks should tick at slightly different rates, due to their different motions (an effect already predicted by special relativity) and their different positions within the Earth's gravitational field. In order to ensure the system's accuracy, the satellite clocks are either slowed down by a relativistic factor, or that same factor is made part of the evaluation algorithm. In turn, tests of the system's accuracy (especially the very thorough measurements {{that are part of}} the definition of universal coordinated time) are testament to the validity of the relativistic predictions.|$|E
