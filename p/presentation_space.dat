The Kitchen continued their eclectic programming at the Mercer Arts Center until the summer of 1973 when they began planning to move to 59 Wooster Street.

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} differences was the coordinate system. While in Windows the 0,0 coordinate was located in the upper left corner, in PM it was in the lower left corner. Another difference was that all drawing operations went to the Device Context (DC) in Windows. PM also used DCs but there was an added level of abstraction called <b>Presentation</b> <b>Space</b> (PS). OS/2 also had more powerful drawing functions in its Graphics Programming Interface (GPI). Some of the GPI concepts (like viewing transforms) were later incorporated into Windows NT. The OS/2 programming model was thought to be cleaner, since {{there was no need to}} explicitly export the window procedure, no WinMain, and no non-standard function prologs and epilogs.|$|E
5000|$|Albus Cavus is a {{collective}} {{of artists and}} educators who transform public spaces with creativity. Originally, it was established as an underground art gallery and <b>presentation</b> <b>space</b> in New Brunswick, New Jersey, United States.

By forming a network of relationships that includes the city government, schools, and businesses, it provides the artists with projects that benefit the local community. Public art installations and murals beautify the neighborhoods and provide the residents with the feeling of ownership and responsibility for their surroundings.|$|E

50|$|Digital {{installation}} art {{constitutes a}} broad {{field of activity}} and incorporates many forms. Some resemble video installations, particularly large scale works involving projections and live video capture. By using projection techniques that enhance an audiences impression of sensory envelopment, many digital installations attempt to create immersive environments. Others go even further and attempt to facilitate a complete immersion in virtual realms. This type of installation is generally site-specific, scalable, and without fixed dimensionality, meaning it can be reconfigured to accommodate different <b>presentation</b> <b>spaces.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Since 2013, Andreas Heusser {{has devoted}} {{himself to the}} {{exploration}} of nothing in art, philosophy and science. This has developed into the No Show Museum, a museum dedicated to nothing and its various [...] {{throughout the history of}} art. The museum's collection includes around 400 works and documents from over 120 international artists of the 20th and 21st centuries. The museum also has a mobile <b>presentation</b> <b>space</b> in a converted postal car. From July to October 2015, the No Show Museum was on tour through Europe, staging around 30 exhibitions in 20 different countries, before finally arriving in Italy, as an official participant of the 56th Venice Art Biennale.The museum reproduces the typical structures, mechanisms, rituals and strategies of established art institutions. As a result, the project becomes a model in which we can observe the contextual conditions that are required for the recognition of something (or nothing) as art. Implicit in the project, then, is the question: What is needed for a successful promotion and marketing of art?In the summer of 2016, the mobile museum was shipped from Europe to America with the mission to spread nothing in the New World: The 80-day exhibition tour led from New York to Canada, then to the West Coast of the U.S., and finally down to Baja California Sur, Mexico.|$|E
5000|$|On the {{northern}} side, {{next to the}} staircase {{that leads to the}} second floor, one finds the so-called 'hall of justice' or 'lower halls', the principal <b>presentation</b> <b>space</b> of the Castle. It is a large hall on a rectangular plan, with the walls completely covered in a fresco of a fictive loggia with columns of marble, alabaster and transparent crystal. Scenes of the hunt, courtly life and northern landscapes are represented. The cycle of decoration culminates with the judgement of Paris, in which the commissioner of the work, George of Challant, is actually represented as Paris. The frescoes of this hall, probably completed before the death of George of Challant in 1509, have been attributed to the Master of Wuillerine, an artist thought to have been of the Franco-Flemish school, as may be deduced from the presence in the landscapes of houses with sharply-pitched roofs and windmills of the type typical in northern Europe. The Master of Wuillerine {{is also the author of}} an [...] "ex voto" [...] for the collegiate church of Saint Ursus at Aosta. The ceiling is of wood with the trusses left exposed. Placed along the walls on the long sides of the hall are placed carved wooden stalls, nineteenth-century recreations of the late-Gothic originals conserved in the Turin City Museum of Ancient Art. The rear wall of the hall is pierced by a large stone fireplace decorated by a griffin and a lion that hold the arms of the Challant family aloft.|$|E

40|$|One {{important}} consideration in dictionary-making {{has been that}} of space. To conserve space in paper dictionaries, a number of principles, strategies and conventions have been employed. With the gradual transition of the dictionary to the electronic medium, some of these strategies and conventions have lost or changed their significance. For one thing, {{it is no longer}} sufficient to speak of dictionary space alone, as was customary with paper dictionaries. One should now distinguish between at least two types of space: storage space and <b>presentation</b> <b>space.</b> In fact, this distinction is also valid for paper dictionaries. By storage space I mean the capacity to hold the total content of the dictionary. Storage space restrictions are no longer a major concern in electronic dictionaries except for the most space-consuming content, such as high-resolution video. <b>Presentation</b> <b>space</b> refers to the display of lexicographic information, and here the restrictions are very real in the case of electronic dictionaries. The (potentially) dynamic character of lexicographic presentation in electroni...|$|E
