40|$|A Hilton {{combustor}} was substantially {{modified to}} a suitable symmetrical configuration for research purposes. Provisions for swirl, preheat and injection of LCV gases were incorporated with appropriate burner management systems for safe operation. Instrumentation for temperature, velocity and concentration measurements {{was developed and}} fully automated by interfacing to a microprocessor for rapid data acquisition. Flame stability limits were determined {{over a wide range}} of operating conditions by varying swirl, secondary air temperature and excess air levels while maintaining the burner momentum constant. Addition of swirl up to a limit of O~ 69 generally improved stability. Preheating secondary air alone was beneficial only if the temperature was raised to at least 250 oC. A combination of intermediate swirl and moderate preheat of the secondary air resulted in satisfactory flame stability over a wide range of calorific values of the fuel. Thus, existing concentric <b>pipe</b> <b>burner</b> systems may be easily modified at low cost to burn LCV gases of variable compositions. With LCV gas flames the excess air factor (EAF) had a major influence on values of temperature, species concentration and velocity. Unburnt hydrocarbon (UHC) and CO not surprisingly increased in concentration close to the blow-off limits under the majority of operating conditions. This indicated incomplete combustion probably resulting from the lowered flame temperatures and partial flame lift-off. On the other hand, burnout efficiencies at the exhaust were reasonably high for most operating conditions involving LCV gases. The combustion data were analysed to extract the characteristic mixing and chemical reaction times the ratio of which gave the parameter epsilon, originally proposed for unconfined flames. Close to the blow-off limit epsilon took the value 4. 9 compared with 6. 2 for fully stable flames. This finding showed that the criterion was also valid for confined flames, supporting the extinction mechanism proposed by Peters and Williams, and providing an important basis for predicting stability limits and burner design parameters...|$|E

If point 7 is fulfilled with the help of experience, be able to operate as a projectcoordinator in the purchase of a professional burner. This task will include coordinating the project group in various meetings and then lead to an RFQ (Request For Quotation). Results from the project show the great potential in an optimization of a burner at a cement plant. A production increase of 5 % could be seen together with a lowered specific energy consumption which is extremely satisfactory results. Unfortunately a breakdown of the system occurred a bit down the path of optimisation that resulted in damages to the kiln. At this stage the optimization was stopped and the old burner was put back after finished kiln repair. Finally crucial to underline is that the proven results in this study convinced the Group Management of buying a new burner. The benefits from a professional tailor made burner are far greater than the cost of buying it. The payback time is roughly around a year for such an investment depending on current market conditions. In this report focus is put on the combustion process at a cement plant.

5000|$|When fog {{prevented}} returning Allied aircraft from locating {{and seeing}} their runways to land, {{they would be}} diverted to FIDO equipped aerodromes. RAF night bombers which were damaged on their missions were also diverted to FIDO airfields due {{to the need to}} make certain they could land when they arrived. When FIDO was needed, the fuel pumps were started to pour flammable liquid into the pipe system and a jeep with a flaming brand lashed to its rear drove fast down both sides of the runway to ignite the fuel at the outlets in the <b>pipes.</b> The <b>burners</b> were sometimes ignited by men on bicycles or by runners on foot. [...] The result was a row of flame {{along the side of the}} runway that could be seen for a great distance from the air. The heat from the flames evaporated suspended fog droplets so that the Allied aircraft could have suitable visibility to find the airfield and land. Once landed, the crews would find shelter where they could, and their planes would be refuelled and, if needed, repaired before flying back to their normal bases the next day.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} most {{portable}} gas cartridge stoves {{is similar to}} that of many pressurized burner stoves, except the fuel tank or cartridge contains a liquefied gas - typically butane, propane or a mixture of hydrocarbons - that is held under pressure. While the gas in the cartridge is in a liquid state when stored under pressure, it vaporizes immediately as it leaves the storage bottle (i.e., without priming), arriving at the burner as a gas. The principal advantage of gas cartridge stoves is convenience: no priming is required, they are generally maintenance-free and capable of immediate high heat output, the flame is easily adjusted and they are generally considered simpler to operate. There are two basic designs for most gas cartridge stoves used for camping: the burner assembly is fitted into the top of the gas cartridge, which serves as the stove's base, or the stove is free-standing and the cartridge is separated from the burner and connected by means of a small hose or <b>pipe.</b> Single <b>burner</b> propane stoves commonly used in food service have the gas container integrated into the body of the stove. Butane cartridges are almost exclusively manufactured in South Korea with the only exception being one manufacturer in Houston, Texas. Butane canisters manufactured in South Korea contain butane from Saudi Arabia, while the American manufacturer fills canisters with domestic butane.|$|R
40|$|Industrial {{experiments}} were performed for a retrofitted 660 Â MWe full-scale down-fired boiler. Measurements of ignition {{of the primary}} air/fuel mixture flow, the gas temperature distribution of the furnace and the gas components in the furnace were conducted at loads of 660, 550 and 330 Â MWe. With decreasing load, the gas temperature decreases and the ignition position of the primary coal/air flow becomes farther along the axis of the fuel-rich <b>pipe</b> in the <b>burner</b> region under the arches. The furnace temperature also decreases with decreasing load, as does {{the difference between the}} temperatures in the burning region and the lower position of the burnout region. With decreasing load, the exhaust gas temperature decreases from 129. 8 Â Â°C to 114. 3 Â Â°C, while NOx emissions decrease from 2448 to 1610 Â mg/m 3. All three loads result in low carbon content in fly ash and great boiler thermal efficiency higher than 92 %. Compared with the case of 660 Â MWe before retrofit, the exhaust gas temperature decreased from 136 to 129. 8 Â Â°C, the carbon content in the fly ash decreased from 9. 55 % to 2. 43 % and the boiler efficiency increased from 84. 54 % to 93. 66 %.
