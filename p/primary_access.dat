40|$|Individual health {{outcomes}} differ greatly between neighborhoods, and {{recent research has}} begun to examine how neighborhood environment affects individual health. A common hypothesis is that the inequitable distribution of healthcare resources limits {{access to health care}} for individuals in disadvantaged neighborhoods, causing poorer long-term health. Yet, research has not examined if neighborhood environment actually affects an individual's ability to <b>access</b> <b>primary</b> care. Data from the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey suggests there is significant variation between neighborhoods in an individual's ability to <b>access</b> <b>primary</b> care. This neighborhood-level effect is not explained by the composition of individuals living in the neighborhood. Four mechanisms through which neighborhood environment could affect an individual's ability to <b>access</b> <b>primary</b> care are examined: (1) neighborhood information networks, (2) neighborhood health behavior norms, (3) neighborhood social capital and (4) neighborhood healthcare resources. Social capital and healthcare resources significantly predict an individual's <b>primary</b> care <b>access.</b> Since differences in <b>primary</b> care <b>access</b> may explain individual-level health disparities between neighborhoods, policies designed to improve <b>primary</b> care <b>access</b> must account for both individual and neighborhood effects.

40|$|Novice teen {{drivers have}} disproportionally {{elevated}} crash rate compared to older drivers’. The high crash rate among novices is generally attributed to multiple risk factors, including driving inexperience, young age, risky driving behavior, vehicle accessibility, time of day, and driving with teenage passengers. The current naturalistic driving study with novice-teenagers evaluated the associations between vehicle accessibility (primary or shared) and driving conditions. Of 83 study participants 55 had <b>primary</b> vehicle <b>access.</b> Teens who shared a vehicle drove 22 % more miles {{with an adult}} passenger in the vehicle compared to teens with <b>primary</b> vehicle <b>access.</b> <b>Primary</b> vehicle <b>access</b> {{was significantly associated with}} increased driving exposure (i. e. number of trips and miles driven) and driving with teen passengers. Driving with an adult present is protective, while greater exposure and driving with teenage passengers are known risk factors. Our findings indicate that <b>primary</b> vehicle <b>access</b> increases exposure overall and to driving with teen passengers, thereby increasing crash risk...|$|R

5|$|On April 28, 2014, {{pedestrian}} {{access to}} the station was partially cut off when the abutting landowner erected a fence on the station's <b>primary</b> <b>access</b> point, forcing riders to walk a short distance along the tracks to a different business lot, {{in an effort to}} stop commuters from parking on his business lots. He removed a section of the fence for platform access after meeting with the MBTA, but disputed whether he was required to provide access and station facilities according to the terms of the 1960 land sale. Despite intervention by state legislators and a postcard campaign by residents, an agreement was not reached in 2014. In December 2014, the MBTA rejected a plan that would have created a pedestrian access path and a vehicle dropoff lane, alleging that the landowner had unfairly shifted property lines.|$|E
