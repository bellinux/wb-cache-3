40|$|A {{comparative}} fining {{trial was}} conducted in a laboratory scale to study the influence of protein fining agents on proanthocyanidins, colour and browning potential of white wine. The monomeric flavanols were significantly depleted by casein, and gelatine with low molecular weight (MW) distribution, and isinglass obtained from fish swim bladder (MW > 94. 0, containing some bands in the range 94. 0 – 43. 0 and at 20. 1 kDa). However, the other gelatines and isinglass with a MW polydispersion below 20. 1 kDa did not interact significantly (P < 0. 05) with these compounds. In contrast, the oligomeric compounds were not decreased by swim bladder isinglass. It was also observed that neither of the isinglasses decreased the polymeric flavanols significantly (P < 0. 05). Although casein and <b>potassium</b> <b>caseinate</b> had similar MW distributions and isoelectric points, <b>potassium</b> <b>caseinate</b> decreased the polymeric flavanols, whereas casein did decrease monomeric, oligomeric and polymeric flavanols significantly (P < 0. 05). The degree of polymerisation of polymeric proanthocyanidins that remained in the fined wine decreased significantly (P < 0. 05) after addition of protein fining agents except when <b>potassium</b> <b>caseinate</b> was used. Casein, <b>potassium</b> <b>caseinate</b> and swim bladder isinglass induced a significant (P < 0. 05) decrease in wine colour (A 420 nm), a decrease in browning potential {{and a decrease in}} turbidit...|$|E
40|$|Seven {{treatments}} (activated charcoal, bentonite, PVPP, yeast cell walls, <b>potassium</b> <b>caseinate,</b> zeolite and {{grape seed}} oil) were evaluated for their efficacy in decreasing {{the concentration of}} geosmin, responsible for earthy off-flavour in wine. In the red wine the <b>potassium</b> <b>caseinate</b> and grape seed oil treatments decreased the concentration of geosmin by 14 % and 83 %, respectively, while in the white wine, the activated charcoal and the grape seed oil were able to decrease the concentration of geosmin by 23 % and 81 %, respectively. The effective treatments in decreasing geosmin also decreased aroma volatile compounds, most of all esters, responsible for fruity notes. Considering the OAVs (concentration/odour threshold) only the treatment with grape seed oil was able to decrease the relative contribution of geosmin to {{the profile of the}} odour active compounds, both in red and in white wine. Sensory analysis confirmed the efficacy of the grape seed oil as a remedial treatment...|$|E
40|$|Aims: Volatile phenols (4 -ethylphenol and 4 -ethylguaiacol) affect wine quality by imparting, above certain concentrations, aroma defects. This work {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of some common oenological practices on the concentration of volatile phenols and the sensory impact of these odour-active compounds in wines. Methods and results: The studied oenological practices {{were based on the}} addition of gum arabic, mannoproteins, yeast cell walls, lees, oak chips, dairy cream and <b>potassium</b> <b>caseinate</b> and on the application of a bubbled nitrogen stream. These treatments were applied to naturally contaminated wines containing volatile phenols at concentrations above detection threshold. The treated wines were characterised by chemical and sensory analysis. The most effective treatments in the reduction of the concentration of volatile phenols were the addition of fine lees, cream and <b>potassium</b> <b>caseinate.</b> Apart from being able to partially remove these compounds (approximately 35 % removal), fine lees contributed to a greater “freshness” and complexity of the wines. Although the addition of cream did decrease the sensory impact of volatile phenols, it did not benefit the wines as these were strongly marked by dairy aromas. The use of oak chips, although it did not have a notable effect on the removal of volatile phenols, led to a significant reduction in the perception of these compounds...|$|E
40|$|In this study, the {{potentiality}} of Patatin (P), {{a protein}} extracted from potato, as must fining agent was investigated on musts obtained from two South Italy grape cultivars (Falanghina and Greco). Besides P, fining agents as bentonite (B) and <b>potassium</b> <b>caseinate</b> (C) were assayed at different concentrations. The rate of sedimentation, {{the decline of}} turbidity during time, the absorbance at 420 nm, the GRP (grape reaction products) and hydroxycinnamic acids (HCA) concentrations were determined. The comparative trials showed that P is a suitable fining agent to prevent browning and decrease haze during must settling because its effect on grape phenolics, brown pigments and turbidity is comparable and/or better than that detected for C. Its use as single fining agent or in combination with B depends on must characteristics...|$|E
40|$|The fate of {{four new}} {{fungicides}} (cyprodinil, fludioxonil, pyrimethanil, and tebuconazole) from the treatment on vine {{to the production}} of wine was studied. The influence of clarifying agents (bentonite, charcoal, <b>potassium</b> <b>caseinate,</b> gelatin, and polyvinylpolypyrrolidone) on residue concentrations in wine was also studied. The fungicide residues on grapes showed different decay rates after treatment, with first-order kinetics and half-lives ranging from 8 to 57 days. Grape processing into wine caused considerable residue reduction with cyprodinil (ca. 80 %), fludioxonil (ca. 70 %), and tebuconazole (ca. 50 %) and no reduction with pyrimethanil. The two wine-making techniques employed (with and without maceration) had the same influence on the residue concentrations in wine, except for fludioxonil which showed maximum residue reduction with vinification with maceration. Among the clarifying agents tested, only charcoal showed effective action on the elimination of residue content in wine, proving complete elimination, or almost, of fungicide residues...|$|E
40|$|The fate of {{residues}} of five insecticides (chlorpyrifos methyl, fenthion, methidathion, parathion methyl, and quinalphos) {{from the}} treatment on vine {{to the production}} of wine was studied. The influence of clarifying agents (bentonite, charcoal, <b>potassium</b> <b>caseinate,</b> gelatin, polyvinylpolypyrrolidone, and colloidal silicon dioxide) on residue concentrations in wine was also studied. The insecticide residues on grapes showed high decay rates after treatment, with first-order kinetics and half-lives ranging from 0. 97 to 3. 27 days. Grape processing into wine caused considerable residue reduction (> 80 %) for chlorpyrifos methyl, parathion methyl, and quinalphos, moderate reduction (ca. 50 %) for methidathion, and almost no reduction for fenthion. The wine-making technique (with or without maceration) had the same influence on the residue concentrations in wine. The clarifying agents tested showed no or moderate influence on the residue contents in wine with the exception of charcoal, which allowed complete or almost complete elimination of insecticide residues...|$|E
40|$|The use of plant-derived {{proteins}} as {{wine fining}} agent has gained increased interest {{owing to the}} potential allergenicity of animal proteins in susceptible subjects. Patatin P {{is the name of}} a family of glycoproteins that can be recovered from potato aqueous by-product. In this study, a comparative fining trial simulating industrial procedures with 10, 20 and 30 g/hL of commercial preparations of patatin, <b>potassium</b> <b>caseinate,</b> gelatin and egg albumin on an Aglianico (Vitis vinifera L.) red wine was performed. Color indexes and phenolics were analyzed by spectrophotometric methods and HPLC. The potential astringency has been evaluated by an index based on the ability of wine to precipitate salivary proteins (SPI, Saliva Precipitation Index). Patatin is a suitable alternative to animal proteins used as fining agent because: (i) a decrease in total phenolics and tannins after the treatments with 10, 20 and 30 g/hL of commercial preparation containing P was detected; (ii) Patatin, as well as all the fining agents used in this experiment, is able to diminish astringency and the content of red wine phenolics able to react with salivary proteins. Considering all concentrations tested, the effectiveness in reducing proteins reactive towards wine polyphenols was patatin = gelatine > egg albumin > casein (p < 0. 05); (iii) at each concentration considered, the treatment with patatin causes no depletion of chromatic characteristics of red wine although a significant slight loss of individual anthocyanins was observed...|$|E
40|$|Semillon and Shiraz grapes {{containing}} ochratoxin A (OA) {{were produced}} by inoculation of bunches {{on the vine}} with Aspergillus carbonarius. Small scale vinification of these grapes was performed and the OA content at various stages was analysed. Semillon must was treated with pectolytic enzymes and the juice after pressing was fined with bentonite. Neither pectolytic enzymes nor bentonite influenced the OA content of the clarified juice. Shiraz must was vinified by either static or rotary fermentation. No differences in the OA content of wine after pressing were noted. OA was concentrated in juice lees and gross lees. However, additional juice or wine recovered from lees after centrifugation did not display increased OA contamination compared to racked juice or wine. Addition of bentonite at 2. 5 g/L to a Semillon wine containing 56 mg grape-derived protein/L and ca. 8 μg OA/kg resulted in a 67 % reduction in OA concentration. <b>Potassium</b> <b>caseinate</b> showed some effect, whereas gelatin, isinglass and PVPP did not significantly diminish OA in white wine compared to wine settled without fining agents. Addition of yeast hulls at 5. 0 g/L to a Shiraz wine containing ca. 5 μg OA/kg yielded a 43 % reduction. Gelatin was also slightly effective. Storage of wine for 10 - 14 months resulted in a decrease in OA concentration of 22 % and 29 % for white and red wines, respectively. Su-Lin l. Leong, Ailsa D. Hocking and Eileen S. Scot...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} urea {{addition}} on the self-assembly of caseinate sub-micelles and subsequent {{impact on the}} structural and material properties of caseinate solutions and caseinate stabilised oil-in-water emulsions (30 vol% oil) were studied. Sub-micellar particle size and distribution were measured using dynamic light scattering. Sodium caseinate in solution showed a bimodal particle size distribution centred at 20 and 120 nm (radius). The increasing addition of urea (1. 1 to 6. 6 M) was seen to cause {{a reduction in the}} size of caseinate sub-micelle, which was attributed to a dissociation of the sub-micellar fraction arising from a reduction in hydrophobic interactions. For sodium caseinate solutions above estimated sub-micellar close-packing phase volumes (＞ 10 wt% protein concentration), increasing addition of urea was seen to significantly lower solution viscosity with more pronounced changes observed with increasing protein concentration. All the urea-treated solutions were Newtonian. For sodium caseinate stabilised emulsions, where protein concentrations were above the critical threshold for onset of depletion flocculation, the addition of urea was seen to result in a reduction in depletion free energy of the emulsions. The effects of reduced depletion interaction on emulsion stability, structural and rheological properties were found to be dependent not only on the concentration of added urea, but also on the protein concentration in the emulsions. For 2 and 4 wt% caseinate concentrations, depleted droplets reduced with increasing urea concentration and the emulsion stability increased as well. For 6 wt% protein concentration, the stability decreased with the addition of 1. 1 and 3. 3 M urea, and it was re-established when the urea concentration was up to 6. 6 M. This was attributed to the synergic effects on the depletion potential and continuous phase viscosity which were induced by urea, and it was supported by the results of creaming profiles, rheological properties and microstructure. Likewise, urea had similar effects on the emulsions stabilised by <b>potassium</b> <b>caseinate...</b>|$|E
40|$|Mycotoxins are toxic {{secondary}} metabolites {{produced by}} certain moulds, being ochratoxin A (OTA) {{one of the}} most relevant. Its chemical structure is a dihydro-isocoumarin connected at the 7 -carboxy group to a molecule of L [...] phenylalanine via an amide bond. OTA contamination of wines might be a risk to consumer health, thus requiring treatments to achieve acceptable standards for human consumption [1]. According to the Regulation No. 1881 / 2006 of the European Commission, the maximum limit for OTA in wine is 2 µg/kg [2]. Therefore, the aim of this work was to know the effect of different fining agents on OTA removal, as well as their impact on white and red wine physicochemical characteristics. To evaluate their efficiency, 11 commercial fining agents (mineral, synthetic, animal and vegetable proteins) were used to get new approaches on OTA removal from white and red wines. Trials were performed in wines artificially supplemented (at a final concentration of 10 µg/L) with OTA. The most effective fining agent in removing OTA (80 %) from white wine was a commercial formulation that contains gelatine, bentonite and activated carbon. Removals between 10 - 30 % were obtained with <b>potassium</b> <b>caseinate,</b> yeast cell walls and pea protein. With bentonites, carboxymethylcellulose, polyvinylpolypyrrolidone and chitosan no considerable OTA removal was verified. In red wine, removals between 6 - 19 % were obtained with egg albumin, yeast cell walls, pea protein, isinglass, gelatine, polyvinylpolypyrrolidone and chitosan. The most effective fining agents in removing OTA from red wine were an activated carbon (66 %) followed again by the commercial formulation (55 %), being activated carbon a well-known adsorbent of mycotoxins. These results may provide useful information for winemakers, namely for the selection of the most appropriate oenological product for OTA removal, reducing wine toxicity and simultaneously enhancing food safety and wine quality.

40|$|In Europe, wine is {{estimated}} to be the second source, after cereals, of ochratoxin A (OTA), {{one of the most important}} mycotoxin found in food and feed products [1]. Its chemical structure consists of a chlorine-containing dihydro-isocoumarin linked through the 7 -carboxyl group to L [...] phenylalanine. In wine, this fungal metabolite represents a severe risk for consumer health. According to the European Commission Regulation (EC) No. 123 / 2005 the maximum limit for OTA in wine is 2 g/Kg [2]. Therefore, it is important to prevent and control their occurrence in wines. With the purpose to remove this toxin, several chemical, microbiological and physical methods were described in the literature [1, 3, 4]. Consequently, the aim of this work is to understand the interaction of different types of fining agents on OTA removal from wine. To evaluate their effectiveness, eleven commercial fining agents, including mineral, synthetic, animal and vegetable proteins were used to get new approaches on OTA removal from wine. Trials were performed in wines added of OTA. Most effective fining agent in removing OTA was a commercial formulation that contains activated carbon, a well-known adsorbent of mycotoxins. Reductions between 10 and 30 % were also obtained with <b>potassium</b> <b>caseinate,</b> yeast cell walls and pea protein. However, with bentonites, carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP) and chitosan no considerable reduction of OTA was verify. Also, the influence of these fining agents on the physicochemical wine characteristics, namely wine color, total phenolic compounds, flavonoids and non-flavonoids were studied. Final results could provide important information to the wine industry to select treatments based on fining agents to remove OTA, in order to reduce toxicity and consequently to improve wine safety and preserving wine quality.

40|$|The {{presence}} of mycotoxins in foodstuff {{is a matter}} of concern for food safety. Mycotoxins are toxic secondary metabolites produced by certain molds, being ochratoxin A (OTA) one of the most relevant. Wines can also be contaminated with these toxicants. Several authors have demonstrated the {{presence of}} mycotoxins in wine, especially ochratoxin A (OTA) [1]. Its chemical structure is a dihydro-isocoumarin connected at the 7 -carboxy group to a molecule of L [...] phenylalanine via an amide bond. As these toxicants can never be completely removed from the food chain, many countries have defined levels in food in order to attend health concerns. OTA contamination of wines might be a risk to consumer health, thus requiring treatments to achieve acceptable standards for human consumption [2]. The maximum acceptable level of OTA in wines is 2. 0 g/kg according to the Commission regulation No. 1881 / 2006 [3]. Therefore, the aim of this work was to reduce OTA to safer levels using different fining agents, as well as their impact on white wine physicochemical characteristics. To evaluate their efficiency, 11 commercial fining agents (mineral, synthetic, animal and vegetable proteins) were used to get new approaches on OTA removal from white wine. Trials (including a control without addition of a fining agent) were performed in white wine artificially supplemented with OTA (10 µg/L). OTA analysis were performed after wine fining. Wine was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min and 1 mL of the supernatant was collected and added of an equal volume of acetonitrile/methanol/acetic acid (78 : 20 : 2 v/v/v). Also, the solid fractions obtained after fining, were centrifuged (4000 rpm, 15 min), the resulting supernatant discarded, and the pellet extracted with 1 mL of the above solution and 1 mL of H 2 O. OTA analysis was performed by HPLC with fluorescence detection according to Abrunhosa and Venâncio [4]. The most effective fining agent in removing OTA (80 %) from white wine was a commercial formulation that contains gelatine, bentonite and activated carbon. Removals between 10 - 30 % were obtained with <b>potassium</b> <b>caseinate,</b> yeast cell walls and pea protein. With bentonites, carboxymethylcellulose, polyvinylpolypyrrolidone and chitosan no considerable OTA removal was verified. Following, the effectiveness of seven commercial activated carbons was also evaluated and compared with the commercial formulation that contains gelatine, bentonite and activated carbon. The different activated carbons were applied at the concentration recommended by the manufacturer in order to evaluate their efficiency in reducing OTA levels. Trial and OTA analysis were performed as explained previously. The results showed that in white wine all activated carbons except one reduced 100 % of OTA. The commercial formulation that contains gelatine, bentonite and activated carbon (C 8) reduced only 73 % of OTA concentration. These results may provide useful information for winemakers, namely for the selection of the most appropriate oenological product for OTA removal, reducing wine toxicity and simultaneously enhancing food safety and wine quality.
