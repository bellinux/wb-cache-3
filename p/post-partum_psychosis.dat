50|$|After {{qualifying}} {{as a child}} psychotherapist, Rhode {{worked in}} the National Health Service at Paddington Green Child Guidance Clinic and in private practice, and studied with eminent Kleinian psychoanalysts including Wilfred Bion. His first psychoanalytically-informed book was Of Birth and Madness, a London Times Book of the Week. It arose out of interviews he conducted in an inpatient unit for mothers with <b>post-partum</b> <b>psychosis</b> and their babies, but also addressed the historical and cultural evolution of attitudes towards pregnancy and childbirth and the psychiatric theories they inspired. His later books continue to be psychoanalytically informed but extend into aspects of traditional cosmology. Married to the child psychotherapist Maria Rhode. Four children. He lives in London.|$|E
5000|$|Whalley's popular science {{account of}} [...] "The Ageing Brain" [...] (Phoenix Press, 2004, {{published}} in the USA and translated into Spanish, Italian and Japanese) describes some of his research findings on brain structural and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, nutrition, genetics and physical health and how these explain differences in individual rates of ageing of some mental abilities while others are relatively preserved. His work [...] "Understanding brain aging and dementia: a life course approach" [...] was published in 2015 by Columbia University Press [...] He is currently Crombie Ross Professor emeritus at the University of Aberdeen (2008-2022)and research professor at the University of the Highlands & Islands (2010-2020). He has lectured widely in UK, USA, South Africa, Canada and Australia mostly about dementia and severe forms of mental illness. He {{was a member of}} the senior clinical scientific staff at the MRC Brain Metabolism Unit, Edinburgh University(1978-1986), senior lecturer in psychiatry (Edinburgh University, 1986-1991) and honorary consultant psychiatrist Lothian Health Board (1978-1991). With George Fink in Edinburgh University Whalley investigated the role of oxytocin in severe mental illness and the benefits of ECT. He detected abnormalities of oxytocinergic function in schizoaffective mania, <b>post-partum</b> <b>psychosis</b> and how ECT modified oxytocin release.|$|E
40|$|Just before 10 : 00 a. m. on June 20, 2001, {{a uniformed}} police officer was {{dispatched}} {{to do what}} he thought was a routine welfare check at a home in Houston, Texas. When the officer met Andrea Yates at the door, she immediately told him, “I just killed my kids. ” When Yates was later asked why she drowned her five children, she claimed she had to in order to save them from hell. The police would learn that Yates had been suffering from long-term post-partum depression and psychosis. Nearly 10 years after Andrea Yates killed her five children, the case remains hotly debated because of the critical legal questions it and other cases involving criminal insanity raise. At her first trial, Yates was convicted of capital murder. After her successful appeal, however, a second jury found that Yates ’ <b>post-partum</b> <b>psychosis</b> rendered her incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong when she murdered her children. She was then civilly committed to a high-security treatment facility—the usual consequence of a successful insanity-based acquittal. 1 What role did Yates ’ severe <b>post-partum</b> <b>psychosis</b> play in the crime? Was she criminally responsible for the murders of her children given her mental illness? And...|$|E
40|$|The {{perinatal}} period {{is associated with}} an increased risk of severe mental disorders. We summarise the evidence regarding the epidemiology, risk factors, and treatment of severe mental illness in relation to childbirth, focusing on bipolar disorder, affective psychosis, and schizophrenia. We discuss women with ongoing chronic conditions and those with the onset of new episodes of <b>post-partum</b> <b>psychosis.</b> Despite the importance of perinatal episodes, with suicide a leading cause of maternal death, few studies are available to guide the management of women with severe mental disorders in pregnancy and the post-partum period. However, general principles of management are discussed, including the need for an individual risk-benefit analysis for each woman...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Hallucination is a {{fundamental}} psychiatric symptom often regarded as a hallmark of psychosis. It {{can be found in}} schizophrenia, other psychoses (including delusional disorder, acute and transient psychosis, <b>post-partum</b> <b>psychosis),</b> affective disorders, dementia, substance induced psychotic disorders, and delirium. Aims and objective: This study is a systematic attempt to study and compare the nature and types of hallucination across three different study groups, namely schizophrenia, mania, and other psychosis. Materials and methods: The study was conducted in a total of 90 randomly selected patients of schizophrenia, mania, and other psychotic disorders, i. e. 30 in each study group. The nature and types of hallucination were assessed by using the Schedule for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN). Results and observation: Hallucination was found in 66. 67...|$|E
40|$|This piece {{discusses}} {{the case of}} Andrea Yates, the woman who confessed to drowning her five children to death and was subsequently convicted of murder (though the conviction has since been overturned). In this piece, Colb contends that Andrea Yates was convicted because of the jurors’ emotional/psychological response {{to the possibility that}} <b>post-partum</b> <b>psychosis</b> could cause an otherwise decent person to commit such brutal acts. As a symptom of denial, Colb argues, the jury rejected the insanity defense and thereby reassured itself that only evil people could do what Yates did. If that were the case, then it would be fine to continue to ignore the issue of mental illness in general and its impact on post-partum women in particular...|$|E
40|$|Background Previous {{cross-sectional}} {{studies have}} highlighted {{a number of}} obstetric variables that {{may be associated with}} the development of broadly defined puerperal (<b>post-partum)</b> <b>psychosis.</b> These include: (a) primiparity, (b) pregnancy complications, (c) delivery complications, (d) Caesarean section, (e) female baby and (f) shorter gestation period. Aims To examine these risk factors in women with well-characterised bipolar affective puerperal psychosis. Method A sample of 129 women with bipolar affective puerperal psychosis were investigated using a design that takes advantage of within-subject comparisons of affected and unaffected deliveries. Results Two of the variables studied were independently associated with an episode of puerperal psychosis: primiparity (odds ratio= 3. 76, P < 0. 001) and delivery complications (odds ratio= 2. 68, P= 0. 022). Conclusions This study provides further evidence of the association between primiparity and puerperal psychosis and suggests that complications during delivery may be associated with a severe post-partum episode...|$|E
40|$|In 2009, Joyce Carol Oates {{published}} {{the collection of}} short stories Dear Husband, which contained the eponymous story inspired by the case of Andrea Yates, a Texan housewife who had killed her five children in the house bathtub in 2001. The woman, who was sectioned in 2007, declared that hers had been “a mother’s final act of mercy”, as she had meant to save her children from the devil. She had been suffering from <b>post-partum</b> <b>psychosis,</b> a condition that made it hard to judge whether she was aware of what she was doing while drowning her kids. The essay analyzes the depiction that Oates made of Yates in her short story, and considers the treatment that the author reserved to her character: is she portrayed as a villain or a victim? With the help of Paul Ricoeur’s concepts of “guilt” and “impurity”, and a comparison between the actuality of the Yeats case and its fictional counterpart, {{it will be possible to}} understand the point of view of the author on the culpability of Andrea Yates...|$|E
40|$|Post-partum {{depression}} (PPD) {{belongs to}} the depressive spectrum consecutive to a pregnancy. It is important to detect {{it as soon as}} possible to avoid non-negligible consequences for the mother, the new born and close relatives. It some cases, PPD may give way to <b>post-partum</b> <b>psychosis,</b> a psychiatric emergency. The present study splits 88 women in two groups, within days of delivery, as a function of their score at the Edinburgh postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), an internationally validated scale which predicts future episodes of PPD. The two groups are then compared to a series of open items, obtained by personal interview, with the objective to better differentiate psychological and historical data giving way to this condition. Among the women, 27. 3 % had a score on the EPDS ≥ 12, which is higher than what is generally encountered in the literature. The main results of this study are: 1) the higher percentage in the at risk group of women living with a significant other; 2) the presence of psychic or somatic issues during the pregnancy; 3) the feelings of negligence by the immediate environment; 4) auto-depreciative tendency, the ill-fulfilling of maternal function. These items are easily detectable if a little more attention was dedicated to young mothers soon after delivery. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Gamma (γ) {{oscillations}} (30 - 120 Hz), an emergent {{property of}} neuronal networks, correlate with memory, cognition and encoding. In the hippocampal CA 3 region, locally generated γ oscillations emerge through feedback between inhibitory parvalbumin-positive basket cells (PV+BCs) {{and the principal}} (pyramidal) cells. PV+BCs express δ-subunit-containing GABAARs (-GABAARs) and NMDA receptors (NMDA-Rs) that balance the frequency of γ oscillations. Neuroactive steroids (NS), such as the progesterone-derived (3 α, 5 α) - 3 -hydroxy-pregnan- 20 -one (allopregnanolone; ALLO), modulate the expression of δ-GABAARs and the tonic conductance they mediate. Pregnancy produces large increases in ALLO and brain-region-specific homeostatic changes in δ-GABAARs expression. Here we show that in CA 3, where most PV+ interneurons (INs) express δ-GABAARs, expression of δ-GABAARs on INs diminishes during pregnancy, but reverts to control levels within 48 hours postpartum. These anatomical findings were corroborated by a pregnancy-related increase {{in the frequency of}} kainate-induced CA 3 γ oscillations in vitro that could be countered by the NMDA-R antagonists D-AP 5 and PPDA. Mimicking the typical hormonal conditions during pregnancy by supplementing 100 nM ALLO lowered the γ frequencies to levels found in virgin or postpartum mice. Our findings show that states of altered NS levels (e. g., pregnancy) may provoke perturbations in γ oscillatory activity through direct effects on the GABAergic system, and underscore the importance of δ-GABAARs homeostatic plasticity in maintaining constant network output despite large hormonal changes. Inaccurate coupling of NS levels to δ-GABAAR expression may facilitate abnormal neurological and psychiatric conditions such as epilepsy, post-partum depression, and <b>post-partum</b> <b>psychosis,</b> thus providing insights into potential new treatments...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction Hypertensive syndromes in {{pregnancy}} {{are one of}} the leading causes of obstetric admissions into intensive care units. They are related to changes in the central nervous system caused by a decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure, indicated by an increase in intracranial pressure. These changes in pressure usually result from acute injuries or a decrease in the mean arterial pressure due to iatrogenic action or shock. However, other vascular disorders may contribute to similar occurrences. Case presentation A 15 -year-old girl was admitted to our hospital complaining of severe headaches since the eighth month of pregnancy, and presented with an arterial blood pressure of 180 / 120 mmHg. The diagnostic hypothesis was pre-eclampsia. Our patient's blood pressure levels remained elevated, and she was submitted to a cesarean section. After the procedure, she was referred to our infirmary, presenting with a blank distant look and with no interaction with the environment, dyslalia, and labial and upper and lower right limb paresis. She was confused and unable to speak, but responded to painful stimuli as she conveyed abdominal pain at superficial and deep palpation. The hypothesis of <b>post-partum</b> <b>psychosis</b> was suggested. She was then transferred to our intensive care unit, maintaining an impassive attitude in bed but reacting to external stimuli. Results of a computed tomography scan revealed ischemic infarction of the territory of her left middle cerebral artery. A selective cerebral arteriography showed bilateral occlusion of her internal carotid artery in the intracranial position, prebifurcation and angiodysplasia in the cervical segments of her internal carotid artery. Sixteen days after hospital admission, our patient died. Conclusion This data shows the need for careful monitoring of hypertensive syndromes {{in pregnancy}} cases, especially in cases with a history of chronic hypertension or with vascular alterations, It also highlights the need for constant supervision of blood pressure levels during the use of anti-hypertensive medications. </p...|$|E
