We find that individual investors are mostly likely to submit a proposal being excluded from the <b>proxy</b> <b>ballot.</b> Since individual investors are not so skillful as institutional investors, we summarize that shareholder proposals are excluded mainly due to sponsors ’ lack of experience and knowledge, {{rather than as a}} self-serving vehicle for shareholder activists to gain bargaining power or to simply annoy management. We also find that most shareholder proposals are omitted because they deal with a matter relating to the company’s ordinary business operations...|$|E

50|$|During the 2016 campaign, Liberal {{candidate}} for Whitehorse Centre, Tamara Goeppel, {{was accused of}} soliciting <b>proxy</b> <b>ballots</b> from ten homeless people in her riding. Proxy votes, a form of franchise in which voters surrender their vote to another in their stead, are intended for use only by voters who {{have reason to believe}} they will be absent from the territory on voting day and advanced polling days.|$|R
50|$|In Canada, the {{province}} of Nova Scotia allows citizens to vote by proxy if they expect to be absent. The Territories of Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut also allow for proxy voting. Canadian prisoners of war in enemy camps were allowed to vote through proxy voting. David Stewart and Keith Archer opine that proxy voting can result in leadership selection processes to become leader-dominated. Proxy voting had only been available to military personnel since World War II, but was extended in 1970 and 1977 to include voters in special circumstances such as northern camp operators, fishermen, and prospectors. The Alberta Liberal Party ran into some difficulties, in that {{an unknown number of}} <b>proxy</b> <b>ballots</b> that were counted may have been invalid. Those who, through proxy voting or assistance of invalids, become knowledgeable of the principal's choice are bound to secrecy.|$|R
50|$|Controversy arose {{when the}} Chief Electoral Officer {{launched}} two inquiries during the campaign, citing concerns about <b>proxy</b> voting, special <b>ballots,</b> and purposeful misinformation by all three {{candidates in the}} Mountainview riding, {{as well as the}} use of proxy votes by Liberal candidate Tamara Goeppel in the Whitehorse Centre riding. The Chief Electoral Officer eventually ruled that there was no wrongdoing in Mountainview, but her inquiry into Whitehorse Centre led the RCMP to press charges in February 2017.|$|R
50|$|In April 2014, Dr. Shamsheer Vayalil filed a {{petition}} in the Indian Supreme Court regarding the NRI Voting Rights. He was {{concerned by the}} existing procedure in which the NRIs had to travel to their constituency to vote. He moved the Supreme Court to make the process easier. Acting on his PIL, the Supreme Court directed the Election Commission to explore the possibilities for NRIs to cast their vote. Acting on the Supreme Court’s directive, the Election Commission set up a committee to explore the possibilities of NRIs to vote. In October 2014, based on the committee’s recommendation, the Election Commission submitted its report to the Supreme Court, which has recommended enabling NRIs to vote by <b>proxy</b> and e-postal <b>ballot.</b> The Indian Government has also favored e-postal ballot for NRIs {{and the introduction of}} the bill in the Indian Parliament for NRI Voting Rights is still awaited.|$|R
5000|$|... "Alarming {{declarations}} {{about the}} likely vote rigging directly point to organizational weaknesses of some candidates {{as the law}} allows for reliable barriers against any electoral fraud. For instance, any presidential candidate can send his two representatives to sit on local and regional electoral commissions, appoint observers {{to keep an eye}} on voting and counting of <b>ballots.</b> <b>Proxies</b> of candidates who have wide authority can also supervise the course of the voting". [...] "There are more than enough supervisory tools. Other effective barriers to electoral fraud are the Central Election Commission members are appointed by major parliamentary parties on a quota principle and numerous international observers. Mass media and NGOs, notably, the Committee of Voters of Ukraine, will also be effective in helping to curb fraud. Of great importance for establishing the final tally are also exit polls run by respected polling companies.they will all be used during the campaign." [...] adding that [...] "All the more so that there are 18 presidential candidates, some having considerable weight. That is why any declarations about the likely fraud are just attempts to justify a defeat of those who make them. Note that those candidates who are selling themselves as strong-willed and tough are most given to such declarations. In fact, such declarations expose them as would-be losers and outsiders" ...|$|R
