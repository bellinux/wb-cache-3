500|$|In 1947, Feller {{announced}} that he would pitch in the Cuban winter league during the off-season, but Commissioner Chandler ruled no major leaguer could play in Cuba. Feller said he would donate his profits from playing in the Cuban winter league to the American Major League players' pension fund: [...] "I want to prove I'm not going to Cuba for any selfish interest but because there is a principle involved and that is the right of any ball player to work at his chosen profession". Feller also believed it was [...] "grossly unfair" [...] that major leaguers who were U.S. citizens could not play in winter leagues but Latin Americans were permitted. Indians owner and president Bill Veeck said, [...] "I have no comment on Bob's outside activities. I don't know whether they've hurt him or not. But I do know this. The great majority of the people of Cleveland think they've hurt him." [...] Feller's barnstorming business savvy and endorsement details {{made him one of the}} wealthiest players of his time but he claimed his off-season exhibitions and barnstorming were necessary to pay for increased medical expenses for his family. His first wife developed anemia after giving birth to their second child when she was given the wrong type of blood during transfusions; she subsequently became addicted to the prescribed medication for her condition. Feller was trying to make up lost earnings as a result, since he missed out on over $200,000 in salary when he served in the Navy; he missed more than three major league seasons. Feller's biographer John Sickels suggested: [...] "They were trying to make money, but part of it was also, he felt that the black players weren't necessarily getting a fair chance and that he wanted to sort of showcase it. And seeing those, I think, those exhibition games helped <b>people</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> the Negro League players were just as good as the Major League players." ...|$|E

2500|$|Even after Steve Bannon's {{role was}} diminished by Trump in mid-April 2017, Voris' {{organization}} was still viewed as notable by national media. [...] On May 9, 2017 The Atlantic released {{a video of}} the Church Militant offices and personal which also included pictures of the then recent New York Times and Detroit Free Press articles. Voris told The Atlantic {{that of all the}} debates held in America, the question of which is the right religion has never been debated. He complained about [...] "A tyranny, a dictatorship of relativism. [...] 'If you don't want to have an abortion don't, I'm going to have mine, you don't want to that's fine. If you don't like gay marriage, don't marry someone of the same sex.' Societies can function like that. There is right and wrong, good and evil, truth and lies. ...The world is so mired in misunderstanding today {{that they need to be}} pointed to - here's truth." [...] Voris discussed his upbringing and the story of how he returned to Catholicism. He also challenged the label of far-right or hate group. The video ended with him saying [...] "The old Michael Voris was a lustful, prideful, acting on hurt, and sense of victim, and all that business. The new Michael Voris, or the new man, is somebody who is now dedicated to helping other <b>people</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> there is no limit to God. It's impossible to do enough to save souls until you have drawn your last breath." ...|$|E

60|$|It is {{exceedingly}} {{difficult to make}} <b>people</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> an evil is an evil. For instance, we seize a man and deliberately do him a malicious injury: say, imprison him for years. One would not suppose that it needed any exceptional clearness of wit to recognize in this an act of diabolical cruelty. But in England such a recognition provokes a stare of surprise, followed by an explanation that the outrage is punishment or justice or something else that is all right, or perhaps by a heated attempt to argue {{that we should all}} be robbed and murdered in our beds if such senseless villainies as sentences of imprisonment were not committed daily. It is useless to argue that even if this were true, which it is not, the alternative to adding crimes of our own to the crimes from which we suffer is not helpless submission. Chickenpox is an evil; but if I were to declare that we must either submit to it or else repress it sternly by seizing everyone who suffers from it and punishing them by inoculation with smallpox, I should be laughed at; for though nobody could deny that the result would be to prevent chickenpox to some extent by making people avoid it much more carefully, and to effect a further apparent prevention by making them conceal it very anxiously, yet people would have sense enough to see that the deliberate propagation of smallpox was a creation of evil, and must therefore be ruled out in favor of purely humane and hygienic measures. Yet in the precisely parallel case of a man breaking into my house and stealing my wife's diamonds I am expected {{as a matter of course}} to steal ten years of his life, torturing him all the time. If he tries to defeat that monstrous retaliation by shooting me, my survivors hang him. The net result suggested by the police statistics is that we inflict atrocious injuries on the burglars we catch in order to make the rest take effectual precautions against detection; so that instead of saving our wives' diamonds from burglary we only greatly decrease our chances of ever getting them back, and increase our chances of being shot by the robber if we are unlucky enough to disturb him at his work.|$|E
