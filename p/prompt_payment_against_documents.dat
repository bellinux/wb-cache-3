40|$|IWA Publishing 2010. The {{definitive}} peer-reviewed {{and edited}} {{version of this}} article is published in the journal Water Policy and is available at www. iwapublishing. com. Cost recovery is a prerequisite for sustainable water service provision. For water utilities, one of the key determinants of overall cost recovery efficiency is the ability to recover payment, within a reasonable timeframe, for all the water bills sent to customers. This study used empirical data, obtained through a cross-sectional survey in eight small urban centres in Uganda, to establish the determinants of customer decisions to pay utility water bills promptly. Regression analysis on the data showed that customer attitude towards <b>prompt</b> <b>payment,</b> perceived ease or difficulty of paying on time (perceived control), as well as social pressure, strongly influence intentions to pay, which in turn directly affects actual <b>prompt</b> bill <b>payment</b> behaviour. The results also show that attitudes towards <b>prompt</b> <b>payment</b> are informed by perceptions of benefits and sacrifices associated with the behaviour, while social pressure is perceived to come from family members, neighbours and the utility itself. Perceived control was found to reflect both internal and external impediments to <b>prompt</b> bill <b>payment,</b> many of which relate to service issues that are within the control of water utility managers...|$|R

5|$|<b>Prompt</b> <b>Payment</b> and Stealing a Ride are two 1911 American silent short comedy films {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. <b>Prompt</b> <b>Payment</b> focuses on a lawyer who evades his creditors, dons a disguise and plays against them {{in a game of}} poker. After winning a large sum of money from them, he excuses himself and returns to pay them with their own money. Stealing a Ride is listed as a comedy, but has a clear dramatic element. Susie and Johnnie are out sledding when Susie's parents are about to go out for a sleigh drive. The children ask to come along, but are refused. The children hitch their sleds {{to the back of the}} sleigh and follow along, only to fall off and get lost in the woods. The parents later track them down and bring them home.
