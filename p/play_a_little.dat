500|$|Before {{the start}} of the 1951 season, Houtteman was drafted into the United States Army. He had {{originally}} been classified 4F, or medically ineligible for the draft, because of a high school knee injury, and he felt that he was drafted only because he was a prominent athlete. He served in the heavy weapons division of the Army, where the roar of the big guns sent pains throbbing through Houtteman's head and gave him severe headaches, which doctors believed was a lingering effect of the skull fracture three years earlier. As a result, the Army reclassified Houtteman as not fully qualified for combat duty. This led to a medical discharge on September 15, 1951. Speaking of his time in the Army, Houtteman said, [...] "I spent most of my time in the Army hospital. I did <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> ball at Camp Pickett", Virginia.|$|E
500|$|With {{the last}} {{pick of the}} eighth round of the 1986 NFL Draft and 221st overall selection, the Bears drafted Douglass. [...] He was the third of four {{defensive}} backs selected by the Bears in that draft (Vestee Jackson 2nd round, Bruce Jones 7th round and Barton Hundley 10th round). The 1986 Bears signed Douglass in mid-July. [...] In training camp, Douglas was switched from cornerback to safety and recovered a fumble in the first exhibition game against the Cowboys. [...] He was described by bears scout Rod Graves as [...] "built more like a fullback and could possibly help us inside as a strong-safety type". The Chicago Tribune listed him at [...] and , and the Chicago Sun-Times reported him at [...] and [...] with the description that [...] "Big, strong, tough hitter who likes to <b>play.</b> <b>A</b> <b>little</b> too slow to play cornerback. Makes some mistakes because of overeagerness." ...|$|E
500|$|Amidst these drastic changes, large {{proportions}} of the freshmen classes (some as high as 30%) contained all-state high school band members. As the band's experience and musical talents grew, {{the quality of the}} music improved dramatically. Haney even rewrote the drills to include a portion where the band stopped moving and played to the audience. This innovation was well received and became a staple of the band's repertoire. In 1975, at a televised game versus the University of Arkansas, the Aggie Band was repeatedly asked to play music during lulls in the game. By the fourth quarter, the Aggie Band had played on TV during every break and Colonel Haney, trying his best to be fair, told the cameraman that they really should let the Razorback Band <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too. The cameraman called up to the broadcast booth to get guidance and then replied, [...] "The director doesn't want to hear the Arkansas band, he wants to hear the Aggie Band." ...|$|E

Upon fleeing the area, the journalist reporting on Cash suddenly arrives in her car and rescues him. She explains that the Director is actually Lionel Starkweather, a former film producer from Los Santos, who was popular in the 90s, but {{was forced to leave}} the industry due to a [...] "scandal". The reporter has been putting together evidence about Starkweather's snuff movies for months, and now she has enough to expose him. First, however, she needs to retrieve some of this evidence from her apartment. Meanwhile, Starkweather orders the chief of the Carcer City Police Department, Gary Schaffer, to bring both Cash and the journalist to him, blackmailing him that he will expose his corruption to the Liberty City Supreme Court if he does not comply.|$|E
500|$|In October 2013, Marvel {{released}} the first trailer for Captain America: The Winter Soldier. The Hollywood Reporter said, [...] "it looks like it'll {{live up to}} the 'political thriller' that's been promised for months now." [...] The Los Angeles Times said, [...] " [...] trailer runs 2½ minutes and teases plenty of action, conspiracy and clever banter between Captain America and his S.H.I.E.L.D. colleagues, with a smattering of the previously released Comic-Con International and D23 footage." [...] The Los Angeles Times also noted that the day before the release of the trailer, the studio released [...] "a teaser for a trailer." [...] The trailer received 23.5 million views in the 24 hours after its release. In November 2013, Jed Whedon, the co-creator of the television series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., said that there are plans to reference events from the film into the show, stating, [...] "Nick Fury is in , and S.H.I.E.L.D. makes an appearance, so we will definitely try to tee-up some stuff and probably <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of the fallout from that film." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 1941, Presley entered {{first grade}} at East Tupelo Consolidated, where his {{instructors}} regarded him as [...] "average". He {{was encouraged to}} enter a singing contest after impressing his schoolteacher with a rendition of Red Foley's country song [...] "Old Shep" [...] during morning prayers. The contest, held at the Mississippi-Alabama Fair and Dairy Show on October 3, 1945, was his first public performance. Ten-year-old Presley was dressed as a cowboy; he stood on a chair to reach the microphone and sang [...] "Old Shep". He recalled placing fifth. A few months later, Presley received his first guitar for his birthday; he had hoped for something else—by different accounts, either a bicycle or a rifle. Over the following year, he received basic guitar lessons from two of his uncles and the new pastor at the family's church. Presley recalled, [...] "I took the guitar, and I watched people, and I learned to <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit. But I would never sing in public. I was very shy about it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Aside from singing, {{she also}} plays instruments, saying [...] "I <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{bit of the}} guitar and the piano." [...] She first showed her skills on playing the piano in the 2004 Pop Ko 'To! concert. She credits her brother, King, for her {{interest}} on it. She can also play the acoustic guitar but prefers the keyboard, believing that it is her key to becoming a composer.|$|E
2500|$|Already {{known as}} 'the crack {{forward of the}} Clapham Rovers', his joining the Castle Blues was welcomed {{in the words of}} a {{football}} commentator writing in The Wellington Journal and Shrewsbury News: [...] "To any of my readers who would wish to see football, I would give the advice, 'See him play'.

2500|$|By {{the end of}} 1997 Killing Heidi had {{acquired}} a new rhythm section with Warren Jenkin on bass guitar (Rick Price, Merril Bainbridge, Deborah Conway) and Adam Pedretti on drums (ex-Non-Intentional Lifeform aka NIL). Pendretti described his recruitment, [...] " [...] had worked with NIL as producer, so he knew I could <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit off the wall... dropped off a Killing Heidi demo and I started learning the songs. It just took off from there." [...] Killing Heidi recorded {{the rest of their}} first studio album, Reflector, throughout 1998 and into 1999. According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, Kosky was [...] "meticulously shaping the band's début album"; he worked as their engineer, producer, talent manager and record label co-owner.|$|E
2500|$|A Little Princess is a children's {{novel by}} Frances Hodgson Burnett, first {{published}} {{as a book}} in 1905. It is an expanded version {{of the short story}} [...] "Sara Crewe: or, What Happened at Miss Minchin's", which was serialized in St. Nicholas Magazine from December 1887. According to Burnett, after she composed the 1902 <b>play</b> <b>A</b> <b>Little</b> Un-fairy Princess based on that story, her publisher asked that she expand the story as a novel with [...] "the things and people that had been left out before". The novel was published by Charles Scribner's Sons (also publisher of St. Nicholas) with illustrations by Ethel Franklin Betts and the full title A Little Princess: Being the Whole Story of Sara Crewe Now Being Told for the First Time.|$|E

2500|$|Coyne {{was brought}} into the Australian squad for the World Cup 2010 qualifiers against Iraq and Qatar in June 2008. He {{impressed}} in training with Australia manager Pim Verbeek saying: [...] "Chris is a leader, a tough defender. I think he can play at a higher level, but we shall see. I think it’s better to <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit more organised in the backline, {{and then we can}} use a player like Chris." [...] He made his debut for Australia in the 0–1 defeat to Iraq in Dubai, impressing with the way he marshalled the defence, leading Verbeek to praise him again, saying, [...] "He's an experienced player, he knows what he's doing and he's made a good impression on us. He's a leader. He's a very good header, he's never in panic." ...|$|E
2500|$|... “After I {{had learned}} to <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> I was chosen to give all the bugle calls.

[...] Then all of the boys would run for their rooms. [...] At nine o’clock the second call was given, when all lights were tuned out and we were supposed to be in bed. [...] Later on I learned the mess call, and eventually could blow all the calls of the regular army.” The Carlisle Indian band of brass instruments performed at football games, world expositions and presidential inaugural parades. On May 24, 1883, Luther led the first “real American” band to cross the Brooklyn Bridge at its grand opening ceremony.|$|E
2500|$|Bob Macpherson (the {{brother of}} Christina) and Paterson {{are said to}} have taken rides {{together}} at Dagworth. Here they would probably have passed the Combo Waterhole, where Macpherson is purported to have told this story to Paterson. Although not remaining in close contact, Paterson and Christina Macpherson both maintained this version of events until their deaths. Amongst Macpherson's belongings, found after her death in 1936, was an unopened letter to a music researcher that read [...] "...one day I played (from ear) a tune, which I had heard played by a band at the Races in Warrnambool...he [...] then said he thought he could write some words to it. He then and there wrote the first verse. We tried it and thought it went well, so he then wrote the other verses." [...] Similarly, in the early 1930s on ABC radio Paterson said [...] "The shearers staged a strike and Macpherson's woolshed at Dagworth was burnt down and a man was picked up dead...Miss Macpherson used to <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> Scottish tune on a zither and I put words to it and called it Waltzing Matilda." ...|$|E

2500|$|Performed by the Four Freshmen, [...] "Their Hearts Were Full of Spring" [...] (1961) was a {{particular}} favorite of the Beach Boys. Brian explained: [...] "My mom turned me on to them. She {{turned on the radio}} and goes, 'Hear that song? This is called 'Day By Day' by the Four Freshmen.' And I listened and I went 'Oh, I love it, Mommy! I love it!' ... We went in [...] and she said you can take records into these little booths and play them to see if you wanted to buy them. ... You know how you sit in a sauna bath and the sweat will come out? That's what that whole experience in that room started to be. I purged all kinds of bullshit and picked up the Freshmen. It was magic. Total magic." [...] By deconstructing their arrangements of pop standards, Brian educated himself on jazz harmony. Lambert notes, [...] "If Bob Flanigan helped teach Brian how to sing, then Gershwin, Kern, Porter, and the other members of this pantheon helped him learn how to craft a song." [...] Wilson continued: [...] "I learned them bar by bar. I'd go to my hi-fi set and I'd <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit. Then I'd stop and try to figure it out, back and forth, back and forth, until I figured the whole song out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Turner was a lower-order {{right-handed}} batsman and a right-arm fast-medium bowler. Though born in Dorset, {{his club}} cricket {{was in the}} Taunton area and he appeared for Somerset's second eleven and its colts' team {{at the age of}} 17. He made his first-team debut in a single first-class match in the 1984 season, but then played fairly regularly in both the first-class and one-day formats in 1985, when Somerset had an unexpectedly poor season and finished {{at the bottom of the}} County Championship. In 10 first-class matches, Turner averaged nearly 24 with the bat, though that was in part due to half his 12 innings ending with him not out, and his highest score was an unbeaten 24 against Warwickshire in the match where Viv Richards made 322. In the same game, Turner took four wickets for 74 runs, the only time he took more than two first-class wickets in an innings. He was no more successful in one-day matches, where in 13 outings he took only 10 wickets and made 68 runs. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack wrote: [...] "Turner... had a few good days, but not enough to attract another contract." [...] But though no longer on the staff, Turner did <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> for Somerset in 1986, appearing in a single first-class fixture and four List A games, in one of which, against Glamorgan, he made an unbeaten 22, his best one-day score.|$|E
