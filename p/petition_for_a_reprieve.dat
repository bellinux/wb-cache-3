50|$|At his {{subsequent}} trial he was defended by H.S. Wood of High Wycombe, {{but the jury}} took just two minutes to find him guilty, despite Wood's attempts to get the charge reduced to manslaughter because of Nell's unfaithfulness. Wood set up a <b>petition</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>reprieve</b> and, assisted by a Miss Eleanor Grave, succeeded in gaining {{a great number of}} signatures. However, the trial judge, Judge Hawkins, stated that Wooldridge's taking the cut-throat razor with him to Windsor was evidence of premeditation and so refused to consider a reprieve.|$|E
5000|$|<b>A</b> recent <b>reprieve</b> to <b>a</b> notably brutal murderer from Lancashire {{may have}} led opinion in Preston to believe that <b>a</b> <b>reprieve</b> was likely <b>for</b> Allen and Evans, and a {{petition}} demanding their hanging was started (there was also <b>a</b> smaller <b>petition</b> calling <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>reprieve).</b> On 10 August, the Home Office sent out letters announcing that the Secretary of State had [...] "failed to discover any sufficient ground to justify him in advising Her Majesty {{to interfere with the}} due course of law" [...] in both cases.|$|R

5000|$|Before Ansell's execution, {{there was}} {{considerable}} public pressure <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>reprieve,</b> {{on the grounds of}} her sex, youth and perceived lack of mental capacity (both of herself, and of other members of her family). The Metropolitan Asylums Board passed <b>a</b> resolution calling <b>for</b> clemency. Some newspapers, including the Daily Mail under the headline [...] "A One-sided Investigation", asked <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>reprieve.</b> Three questions were asked in the House of Commons in relation to her case, and more than 100 MPs signed a petition that her life be spared. However, the Home Office was unwilling to <b>reprieve</b> <b>a</b> poisoner, this murder being considered a premeditated act, and poisoning an especially heinous crime under English law.|$|R
