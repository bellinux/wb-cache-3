25|$|The {{ingredients}} and spiciness of hamin varies from area to area. Iraqi Jews prepare {{their version of}} cholent, known as tebit, with a whole chicken stuffed with rice. Jews from Morocco or Iberia make a version called adafina or dafina, which calls for spices like garlic, cinnamon, allspice, ginger, and pepper, as well as whole eggs that turn brown and creamy during the long cooking process. The Spanish cocido ('stew') containing chicken and chickpeas is a likely offshoot of the traditional hamin of the Spanish Jews. Yemenite Jews have developed various kinds of <b>puff</b> <b>pastry</b> cooked for ten hours, including jahnoun and kuban (eaten {{in the morning of}} the Sabbath rather than at mid-day, with dairy meals).|$|E
25|$|The Dutch and Flemish {{call this}} day Driekoningen, while German {{speakers}} call it Dreikönigstag (Three Kings' Day). In the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and neighboring Germany, children {{in groups of}} three (symbolising the three kings) proceed in costume {{from house to house}} while singing songs typical for the occasion, and receiving a coin or some sweets at each door. They may each carry a paper lantern symbolizing the star. In some places, especially Holland, these troupes gather for competitions and present their skits/songs for an audience. As in Belgium, Koningentaart (Kings' tart), <b>puff</b> <b>pastry</b> with almond filling, is prepared with a black bean hidden inside. Whoever finds the bean in his or her piece is king or queen for the day. A more typically Dutch version is Koningenbrood, or Kings' bread. Another Low Countries tradition on Epiphany is to open up doors and windows to let good luck in for the coming year.|$|E

25|$|He also {{insisted on}} always {{wearing the same}} {{battered}} old flowerpot sunhat during his time out in the field, a constant companion from his debut in 1981 to his last game in 2004. Russell lined up the ball with the specially cut back rim, but it ended up rather worn out. Only his wife Aileen was allowed to repair it, while Russell carried an emergency repair kit of cotton thread and rubber. Its state of age and hence apparent disrepair caused more than one argument with the authorities. Russell refused to wear the official coloured one-day sunhat in South Africa, with a compromise only reached when Russell agreed to wear his old flowerpot hat inside the new sun hat. On a second occasion in the West Indies, he agreed to wash it, and placed it to dry in an oven. Forgotten and resultantly overbaked, the hat caught fire, and was only just rescued from total incineration – the top collapsed like <b>puff</b> <b>pastry</b> on removal.

500|$|Czerniecki's {{goal was}} to present what he called [...] "Old Polish dishes" [...] as opposed to foreign recipes. He did, however, {{reference}} foreign influences throughout the book, particularly from French cuisine and from what he referred to as [...] "Imperial cuisine", that is, the cooking styles of Bohemia and Hungary, then both part of the Habsburg Empire. He displays an ambivalent attitude to French cookery; on the one hand, he dismisses French , or creamy soups, as alien to Polish culture and criticizes the use of wine in cooking. [...] "Every dish may be cooked without wine", he wrote, [...] "it suffices to season it with vinegar and sweetness." [...] On the other hand, Czerniecki does provide recipes for , dishes seasoned with wine, {{as well as other}} French culinary novelties, such as <b>puff</b> <b>pastry</b> (still known today in Poland as [...] "French dough"), arguing that a skilled chef must be able to accommodate foreign visitors with dishes from their own cuisines.

[...] They remain above the doors all year until they are inadvertently dusted off or replaced by new markings the next year. On January 6, as in much of Europe, a Polish style Three Kings cake is served with a coin or almond baked inside. The one who gets it is king or queen for the day, signified by wearing the paper crown that decorates the cake. According to Polish tradition this person will be lucky in the coming year. Recipes vary by region. Some serve a French-type <b>puff</b> <b>pastry</b> cake with almond paste filling, others favor a sponge cake with almond cream filling, and yet others enjoy a light fruitcake.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} ensure the flaky texture of the croissant, it is {{important}} to balance the yeast activity with steam production. If the yeast overproduces CO2, then the well-defined layers may collapse. During the baking process, this would cause steam to escape too early from the bread, reducing dough lift and flakiness of the final product. Thus, to offset the negative effects of yeast on layer integrity and dough lift, croissants usually contain less layers than other <b>puff</b> <b>pastries.</b>|$|R

60|$|I affirm that, {{if these}} five {{departments}} are all perfect, the great ends of domestic cookery are answered, {{so far as}} the comfort and well-being of life are concerned. I am aware that there exists another department, which is often regarded by culinary amateurs and young aspirants as the higher branch and very collegiate course of practical cookery; to wit, confectionery, by which I mean to designate all pleasing and complicated compounds of sweets and spices, devised not for health and nourishment, and strongly suspected of interfering with both,--mere tolerated gratifications of the palate, which we eat, not with the expectation of being benefited, but only with the hope of not being injured by them. In this large department rank all sorts of cakes, pies, preserves, ices, etc. I shall have a word or two to say under this head before I have done. I only remark now that, in my tours about the country, I have often had a virulent ill-will excited towards these works of culinary supererogation, because I thought their excellence was attained by treading under foot and disregarding the five grand essentials. I have sat at many a table garnished with three or four kinds of well-made cake, compounded with citron and spices and all imaginable good things, where the meat was tough and greasy, the bread some hot preparation of flour, lard, saleratus, and acid, and the butter unutterably detestable. At such tables I have thought that, if the mistress of the feast had given the care, time, and labor to preparing the simple items of bread, butter, and meat that she evidently had given to the preparation of these extras, the lot of a traveler might be much more comfortable. Evidently she never had thought of these common articles as constituting a good table. So long as she had <b>puff</b> <b>pastry,</b> rich black cake, clear jelly, and preserves, she seemed to consider that such unimportant matters as bread, butter, and meat could take care of themselves. It is the same inattention to common things as that which leads people to build houses with stone fronts and window-caps and expensive front-door trimmings, without bathing-rooms or fireplaces or ventilators.|$|E

5000|$|The Columbian Exchange, {{which began}} in 1492, had a {{profound}} influence on the baking occupation. Access to sugar greatly increased {{as a result of}} new cultivation in the Caribbean, and ingredients such as cocoa and chocolate became available in the Old World. In the eighteenth century, processors learned how to refine sugar from sugar beets, allowing Europeans to grow sugar locally. [...] These developments led to an increase in the sophistication of baking and pastries, and the development of new products such as <b>puff</b> <b>pastries</b> and Danish dough. Two important books on bread-baking were published in the 1770s: Paul-Jacques Malaouin published L'art du meinier, du boulanger et du vermicellier (The Art of the Miller, the Bread-Baker, and the Pasta-Maker) in 1775, and Antoine-Augustin Parmentier published Le parfair boulanger (The Perfect Bread-Baker) in 1778.|$|R

Kuih is an important feature for festive occasions and is traditionally made at home, but are now available for purchase from home caterers, street hawker vendors, market stallholders and specialist cafes, shops and restaurants. It is difficult to distinguish between kuih of Malay or Peranakan (also known as [...] "Straits Chinese") origin because the histories of traditional kuih recipes have not been well-documented, and cross-cultural influencing over the centuries were commonplace.
