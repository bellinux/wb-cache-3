40|$|Data {{warehouses}} {{are large}} complex systems with many interacting nonlinear components. It is an amalgamation {{of many different}} systems and integration of such diverse elements is its primary concern. It is often difficult for a data <b>warehouse</b> <b>manager</b> to predict {{the performance of the}} system especially when demand pattern for the required data keeps changing. We have developed a simulation model using ARENA simulation package that will simulate the behavior and performance of a data warehouse system environment based on its overall design.

Agricultural producers are urged to sell grain at the harvest time when the price of agricultural products is usually lowest, mostly because of their needs for financial sources. Instead of selling products, farmers can store them in the <b>public</b> <b>warehouses</b> and use short-time financing by lending against warehouse receipt with usually lowest interest rate. In following months, farmers can sell products at higher price and repay short-term loan. This study showed that strategy of using <b>public</b> <b>warehouses</b> and postponing the sale of grains after harvest is profitable strategy for agricultural producers...|$|R

40|$|Sandvik Rock Tools is {{operating}} in a highly competitive market. This requires them to constantly improve the efficiency of their organization, {{in order for them}} to maintain their position as market leaders, both in a short-term and a long-term perspective. Sandvik Rock Tools is currently working on developing and further improving their supply chain. The supply chain is a key organizational function and improvements of the supply chain aim to yield benefits like lowered total costs and better utilized inventory levels. The purpose of our work has been to develop the supply chain between Sandvik’s in-market warehouse and their customer site at Dannemora. The main focus of this thesis has been to enable automatic data collection and to lower the stock levels at the customer site in Dannemora. This would be accomplished by improving the information flow between the two entities in the observed supply chain and by enabling real-time inventory information, easily accessible to the <b>warehouse</b> <b>manager.</b> A barcode system was implemented in the warehouse at the Dannemora customer site and was integrated with warehouse management software that was developed by the authors. The implemented barcode system and the warehouse management software were used at the Dannemora customer site for a period of two months.  The effects of the implemented barcode system working in combination with the warehouse management software were observed in several operational areas after implementation, and the results were positive and beneficial. Firstly, the barcode system and warehouse management software simplified the <b>warehouse</b> <b>manager’s</b> decision process, by providing easy access to necessary warehouse management information, like realtime inventory information. Secondly, it made the day-to-day work routine of the <b>warehouse</b> <b>manager</b> easier, this being the case because the barcode system that had been implemented had digitalized and automated many tasks that had previously been performed manually by <b>warehouse</b> <b>manager.</b> An excellent example would be the simplified process for order placement and stocktaking. Thirdly, it improved the information flow between the Dannemora customer site and Sandvik’s in-market warehouse in Sandviken, thereby improving the overall effectiveness of the entire supply chain, through shared information. The barcode implementation successfully lowered inventory levels by six percent on average...|$|R
