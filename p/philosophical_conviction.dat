25|$|Infertility is {{the main}} reason parents seek to adopt {{children}} they are not related to. One study shows this accounted for 80% of unrelated infant adoptions and half of adoptions through foster care. Estimates suggest that 11–24% of Americans who cannot conceive or carry to term attempt to build a family through adoption, and that the overall rate of ever-married American women who adopt is about 1.4%. Other reasons people adopt are numerous although not well documented. These may include wanting to cement a new family following divorce or death of one parent, compassion motivated by religious or <b>philosophical</b> <b>conviction,</b> to avoid contributing to overpopulation out of the belief that it is more responsible to care for otherwise parent-less children than to reproduce, to ensure that inheritable diseases (e.g., Tay-Sachs disease) are not passed on, and health concerns relating to pregnancy and childbirth. Although there are a range of possible reasons, the most recent study of experiences of women who adopt suggests they {{are most likely to be}} 40–44 years of age, currently married, have impaired fertility, and childless.|$|E

6000|$|The {{theory of}} the unmorality of art has {{established}} itself firmly in the strictly artistic classes. They are free to produce anything they like. They are free to write a [...] "Paradise Lost" [...] in which Satan shall conquer God. They are free to write a [...] "Divine Comedy" [...] in which heaven shall be under the floor of hell. And what have they done? Have they produced in their universality anything grander or more beautiful than the things uttered by the fierce Ghibbeline Catholic, by the rigid Puritan schoolmaster? We {{know that they have}} produced only a few roundels. Milton does not merely beat them at his piety, he beats them at their own irreverence. In all their little books of verse you will not find a finer defiance of God than Satan's. Nor will you find the grandeur of paganism felt as that fiery Christian felt it who described Faranata lifting his head as in disdain of hell. And the reason is very obvious. Blasphemy is an artistic effect, because blasphemy depends upon a <b>philosophical</b> <b>conviction.</b> Blasphemy depends upon belief and is fading with it. If any one doubts this, let him sit down seriously and try to think blasphemous thoughts about Thor. I think his family will find him {{at the end of the}} day in a state of some exhaustion.|$|E
6000|$|The play called The Devil's Disciple {{has great}} merits, but the merits are incidental. Some of its jokes are serious and important, but its general plan {{can only be}} called a joke. Almost alone among Bernard Shaw's plays (except of course such things as How he Lied to her Husband and The Admirable Bashville) this drama does not turn on any very plain pivot of ethical or <b>philosophical</b> <b>conviction.</b> The artistic idea {{seems to be the}} notion of a melodrama in which all the {{conventional}} melodramatic situations shall suddenly take unconventional turns. Just where the melodramatic clergyman would show courage he appears to show cowardice; just where the melodramatic sinner would confess his love he confesses his indifference. This is a little too like the Shaw of the newspaper critics rather than the Shaw of reality. There are indeed present in the play two of the writer's principal moral conceptions. The first is the idea of a great heroic action coming in a sense from nowhere; that is, not coming from any commonplace motive; being born in the soul in naked beauty, coming with its own authority and testifying only to itself. Shaw's agent does not act towards something, but from something. The hero dies, not because he desires heroism, but because he has it. So in this particular play the Devil's Disciple finds that his own nature will not permit him to put the rope around another man's neck; he has no reasons of desire, affection, or even equity; his death is a sort of divine whim. And in connection with this the dramatist introduces another favourite moral; the objection to perpetual playing upon the motive of sex. He deliberately lures the onlooker into the net of Cupid in order to tell him with salutary decision that Cupid is not there at all. Millions of melodramatic dramatists have made a man face death for the woman he loves; Shaw makes him face death for the woman he does not love--merely in order to put woman in her place. He objects to that idolatry of sexualism which makes it the fountain of all forcible enthusiasms; he dislikes the amorous drama which makes the female the only key to the male. He is Feminist in politics, but Anti-feminist in emotion. His key to most problems is, [...] "Ne cherchez pas la femme." ...|$|E
6000|$|There are people, however, who dig {{somewhat}} {{deeper than}} this into the possible evils of dogma. It is felt by many that strong <b>philosophical</b> <b>conviction,</b> while {{it does not}} (as they perceive) produce that sluggish and fundamentally frivolous condition which we call bigotry, does produce a certain concentration, exaggeration, and moral impatience, which we may agree to call fanaticism. They say, in brief, that ideas are dangerous things. In politics, for example, it is commonly urged against a man like Mr. Balfour, or against a man like Mr. John Morley, that a wealth of ideas is dangerous. The true doctrine on this point, again, is surely not very difficult to state. Ideas are dangerous, but the man to whom they are least dangerous is the man of ideas. He is acquainted with ideas, and moves among them like a lion-tamer. Ideas are dangerous, but the man to whom they are most dangerous is the man of no ideas. The man of no ideas will find the first idea fly to his head like wine {{to the head of}} a teetotaller. It is a common error, I think, among the Radical idealists of my own party and period to suggest that financiers and business men are a danger to the empire because they are so sordid or so materialistic. The truth is that financiers and business men are a danger to the empire because they can be sentimental about any sentiment, and idealistic about any ideal, any ideal that they find lying about. just as a boy who has not known much of women is apt too easily to take a woman for the woman, so these practical men, unaccustomed to causes, are always inclined to think that if a thing is proved to be an ideal it is proved to be the ideal. Many, for example, avowedly followed Cecil Rhodes because he had a vision. They might as well have followed him because he had a nose; a man without some kind of dream of perfection is quite as much of a monstrosity as a noseless man. People say of such a figure, in almost feverish whispers, [...] "He knows his own mind," [...] which is exactly like saying in equally feverish whispers, [...] "He blows his own nose." [...] Human nature simply cannot subsist without a hope and aim of some kind; as the sanity of the Old Testament truly said, where there is no vision the people perisheth. But it is precisely because an ideal is necessary to man that the man without ideals is in permanent danger of fanaticism. There is nothing which is so likely to leave a man open to the sudden and irresistible inroad of an unbalanced vision as the cultivation of business habits. All of us know angular business men who think that the earth is flat, or that Mr. Kruger was {{at the head of a}} great military despotism, or that men are graminivorous, or that Bacon wrote Shakespeare. Religious and philosophical beliefs are, indeed, as dangerous as fire, and nothing can take from them that beauty of danger. But there is only one way of really guarding ourselves against the excessive danger of them, and that is to be steeped in philosophy and soaked in religion.|$|E

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the twenty-first century, European societies reflect a great diversity of different religious and <b>philosophical</b> <b>convictions.</b> In order to guarantee that our future society will be just as varied as today's, attention should not only be focused at the different religions and life stances. Rather, for a prospective pluralist society to exist, it is indispensable to have a common identity, shared values, or what could be labeled a 'public morality'. The question is what this identity really means in present-day society and what public morality encompasses. Today's multi-religious society is no longer based on one common religion that serves as a framework for social cohesion. That means it is necessary to find out whether it is possible to articulate a (minimum) public morality, without religion. What is the content of a minimum 'public morality' that citizens of a pluriform society should acknowledge?

While Brecht's conception of the Lehrstück form also aimed at engaging the participants, he naturally viewed the music's 'use' as incidental to the ideas in the play and criticised Hindemith's different end: [...] "the cellist in the orchestra, father of a numerous family, now began to play not from <b>philosophical</b> <b>conviction</b> but for pleasure. The culinary principle was saved." [...] Each dug in his heels and after a 1934 radio broadcast in Brussels neither allowed performances of the other's version.

Linguistic means are obviously chosen in order to support the methodological and <b>philosophical</b> <b>conviction,</b> which Newton calls experimental philosophy, as opposed to the axiomatic-deductive school of the Cartesians. Special attention seems to be given to gradual transitions from an expressive and narrative style to a more formalized and rigid professional language which, among other features, can be characterized by the use of nominalization. Following the approach of Functional Grammar, I consider nominalization as a case of grammatical metaphor. For the analysis of processes of further formalization, I introduce the concept of algebraic metaphor...|$|E

40|$|Information is {{relative}} to its contemplator. A contemplator {{does not exist}} in a vacuum but a magical world of their own disposition. Their magical world is realised through their faculty of mind that makes sense of their own existence. Their sense of existence is atypical realisation. Thus, there is no objective reality that can be realised by others but rather distinctive inter subjective interpretations of inherent realisations. This process of inter-subjective inquiry occurs in a communication continuum. In such a continuum, language or systems of signs are used by interpreters to acquire, represent and manipulate information. Our concern with a communication continuum are the problems of signification which include: reference, inference and choice in the social discourse of accountancy. In this paper, we ponder an <b>philosophical</b> <b>conviction</b> that is based upon the way people interpret and use signs -semiotics- in contemplating such a continuum of signs. The aim of which is two folds: (a) can semiotics provide critical theory-postmodernism with the means of explicit and critical reflection on the barriers to perfect communication which {{is a step in the}} right direction of human emancipation, and (b) to explore the potential of semiotics for intelligent accountancy based applications. ...|$|E

40|$|In England and Wales, it {{has been}} held in the common-law that {{teachers}} are 'in loco parentis' and must {{have the same rights}} as parents to punish children reasonably. The Education Act 1944 did not prohibit corporal punishment in schools. But LEAs may make corporal punishment regulations under Section 23 of the 1944 Education Act. The courts have however held that the right of a teacher to inflict reasonable and moderate corporal punishment overrides the regulations, especially when the teacher does not know about the regulations. In 1966, Plowden Report recommended prohibition of corporal punishment in primary schools. The recommendation was not adopted by the Government. But it produced the Society of Teachers Opposed to Physical Punishment (STOPP) in 1968. And the Labour Party adopted the abolition of corporal punishment as its policy in 1978. The United Kingdom is a party to the European Convention on Human Rights.
