Hardware accelerators such as GPUs and co-processors have emerged as general- purpose processors in today’s high performance computing (HPC) platforms, thereby increasing platforms’ performance capabilities. This trend has allowed greater parallelism and substantial acceleration of scientific simulation software. In order to leverage the power of new HPC platforms, scientific applications must be written in specific lower-level programming languages, {{which used to be}} platform specific. Newer programming models such as OpenACC simplifies implementation and assures portability of applications to run across GPUs from different vendors and multi-core processors. The distance field is a representation of a surface geometry or shape required by many algorithms within the areas of computer graphics, visualization, computational fluid dynamics and more. It can be calculated by solving the eikonal equation using the FSM. The parallel FSMs explored in this thesis have not been implemented on GPU platforms and do not scale to a large problem size. This thesis addresses this problem by designing a parallel algorithm that utilizes a domain decomposition strategy for multi-accelerated distributed platforms. The proposed algorithm applies first coarse grain parallelism using MPI to distribute subdomains across multiple nodes and then fine grain parallelism to optimize performance by utilizing accelerators. The results of the parallel implementations of FSM for GPU-based platforms showed speedup greater than 20 × compared to the serial version for some problems and the newly developed parallel algorithm eliminates the limitation of current algorithms to solve large memory problems with comparable runtime efficiency...|$|R

40|$|The human {{cerebrospinal}} fluid metabolomic database Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) {{is considered to}} be an excellent source of molecular biomarkers of neurological function since it is in direct contact with the extracellular space of the brain. As the CSF contains metabolites and other molecules that can reflect altered brain function, sys tematic studies of the CSF metabolome can potentially offer new insights into central nervous system (CNS) disorders. These include neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, amyo trophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis, and neuro psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia, depression and bipolar disorder. At the time it was first published in 2007, the CSF metabolome database [1] contained 308 detectable metabolites, with information on names, struc tures, concentrations, literature references and disease associations. Since this time, the database has been applied to the study of numerous CNS diseases. Technological advances expand the spectrum of CSF metabolites A new study from David Wishart and coworkers, published in Genome Medicine, represents an important work in the field of biomarker discovery [2]. The authors describe how continuing advances in analytical tech nologies have led to the discovery of many new CSF metabolites, allowing expansion of the CSF metabolome database. They applied five different metabolomic <b>plat</b> <b>forms</b> to characterize multiple CSF samples, and this resulted in identification of new constituent metabolites and an increase in size of the database by approximately 50 %. The authors now give an updated CSF metabolome database that contains detailed information of 476 compounds. Furthermore, the authors have carried out an extensive literature review for additional information on these compounds, including their concentrations and disease associations. The newly identified molecules consist of a number of metabolites (6 acylcarnitines, 13 amino acids, hexose, 42 phosphatidylcholines, 2 lyso phosphatidylcholines and 14 sphingolipids) that should aid neurological studies involving changes in energy metabolism. In addition, Wishart et al. also identified 37 metal ions, which could be useful in studies of neuro degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, since alterations in metal ions are known to occur in this condition [3].

40|$|Through close {{consideration}} of the multiplayer online game The Secret World (2012), this paper works towards a definition of “Weird Games” {{as a basis for}} advocating the aesthetic potential of Weird for digital games. The paper forms part of a more expansive project to examine the uses and formal specificities of Gothic and Weird in digital games. While the Weird Tale shares some features with Gothic, it has a very distinctive form that is beautifully summed by H. P. Lovecraft: The true weird tale has something more than secret murder, bloody bones, or a sheeted form clanking chains according to rule. A certain atmosphere of breathless and unexplainable dread of outer, unknown forces must be present; and there must be a hint, expressed with a seriousness and portentousness becoming its subject, of that most terrible conception of the human brain—a malign and particular suspension or defeat of those fixed laws of Nature which are our only safeguard against the assaults of chaos and the daemons of unplumbed space. (Cited Joshi, 1990 : 6. My italics.) The Weird Tale may be regarded broadly as a part of twentieth-century populist or even trash writing, but, as this special edition of Well-Played attests, it also has a place in digital games and like Gothic it crosses genres and (<b>plat)</b> <b>forms.</b> Indicative of its presence in Indie games are: Alone (Greenwood Games, 2013), developed for the immersive context provided by Oculus Rift providing many opportunities for breaking the fourth wall; Dear Esther (thechineseroom, 2012), which pushed horror grammar towards atmosphere rather than action and The Binding of Isaac (Headup Games, 2011). To these I add examples from prior, bigger budget games such as the Lovecraftian homage Eternal Darkness: Sanity’s Requiem (Silicon Knights, 2002), the early entries in the Silent Hill series (particularly 1 and 2) and the Twin Peaks-like Deadly Premonition (Access Games, 2010 / 2012), where a real-time mechanic contributes to the creation of its version of Weird. More than simply adaptation, Weird is exerting an influence on the formation of innovative contemporary game grammar, largely in contention with established conventions. The analytic framework around this assertion is based in an investigation of the ways that the participatory and rule-based nature of digital game form shapes, at a fundamental level, the ways that the Weird tale manifests in games and I will truncate the term to “Weird”, which further helps relocate it outside text-based literature and places emphasis on its affective coordinates. As such, the paper works towards the proposition that there are certain properties of digital games that are capable of generating a new dimension to the affective experience of Weird...|$|R

40|$|Rice is a {{new crop}} for the country {{in general and the}} study area, Metema, in particular. There is an immense {{potential}} rice production area and high consumer demand. However, the rice sector is not fully developed as compared to the potential. Many institutional, organizational and technological factors were attributed to existing inefficiencies in rice production and utilization. This study was undertaken in Metema District of North Gondar Zone, Amhara National Regional State and has been designed to throw light on the challenges, opportunities and entry points for infusing further innovation (technological institutional and organizational) for upgrading the rice value chain. Identification of actors, their role, linkage, attitudes, habits and practices in the value chain; analyzing the institutional arrangements and enabling environment that affect the functioning of the value chain; and identifying recent innovation activities and their immediate outcomes in the District were the focus of this study. Primary data was collected from 100 randomly selected farm households and other rice value chain actors including input suppliers, marketing agents, consumers and support services. Data was collected using both qualitative and quantitative methods which incorporated semi-structured interview schedule, focus group discussions, key informant interview and personal observation. The main findings of the research revealed that, there are multiple public and non-public actors involved along the rice value chain, upstream from input supply to downstream consumers, playing different role. However, there is no mechanism to coordinate multiple actors together for effective and efficient functioning of the value chain. There is public sector actors’ domination with limited private sector involvement in the value chain. A long tradition of limited responsiveness, top-down, hierarchical, non participatory/ exclusiveness and less risk taking type of organizational culture and, habits and practices lead DoARD to have weak interaction, knowledge and information sharing with the various actors along the value chain. As to the linkage, weak and informal linkage between chain actors characterizes the rice value chain. Lack of post harvest processing technology(rice polisher), limited access to and supply of inputs, severe termite attack, non availability of well developed rice market, high labor demand for crop management, absence of responsible body who works on actors interaction were some of the challenges identified for innovation at various stages of rice value chain. Absence of rice polisher machine was the most critical problem that affects the whole value chain. On the contrary, increased farmer’s awareness about and availability of improved rice varieties, existence of favorable land and climatic condition, presence of high consumer demand, and increased institutional support from different GOs and NGOs were mentioned as opportunities for innovation. In order to address the existing problems and to increase competitive advantage of the rice production, <b>plat</b> <b>forms</b> and partnerships have to be created between value chain actors to create an enabling environment for sharing of information, knowledge and solve existing problems of shortage of rice polisher machine and input supply services.

NP affinity for the avidin/peptide tag complexes was used to provide insight into factors that contribute NP/tag binding. The identified epitope sequence with an optimized length (tMel-tag) was fused to two recombinant proteins. The tagged proteins exhibited higher NP affinity than proteins without tags. The results establish that a fusion peptide tag consisting of optimized 15 amino acid residues can provide strong affinity to an abiotic polymer NP. The affinity and selectivity of NP/tMel-tag interactions were exploited for protein purification in conjunction with immobilized metal ion/His 6 -tag interactions to prepare highly purified recombinant proteins. This strategy makes available inexpensive, abiotic synthetic polymers as affinity agents for peptide tags and provides alternatives for important applications where more costly affinity agents are used. © 2014 American Chemical Society...|$|E
