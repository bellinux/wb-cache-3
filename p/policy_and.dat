40|$|Gender-focused human {{resource}} <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> practices signal an organizationâ€™s perspective on gender diversity.

This paper tests the mediating effects of gender diversity (at non-management and management levels) {{in the relationship between}} gender-focused <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> practices and performance. The findings indicate that non-management gender diversity partially mediates the relationship between gender-focused <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> practices and productivity, and management gender diversity partially mediates the relationship between gender-focused <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> practices and perceived market performance. The results have several theoretical, research and practical implications...|$|R

Tourism <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> organisations are seen here as playing functional roles towards the development of the tourist industry. There are two basic hypotheses to be tested in the thesis, namely: (a) There are causal relations between tourism organisations <b>and</b> <b>policies,</b> <b>and</b> tourist industry development. (b) There are evaluable functions that tourism <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> organisations play {{in the development of the}} tourist industry.
