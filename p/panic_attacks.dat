5|$|Alprazolam is {{effective}} in the relief of moderate to severe anxiety and <b>panic</b> <b>attacks.</b> However, {{it is not a}} first line treatment since the development of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Alprazolam is no longer recommended in Australia for the treatment of panic disorder due to concerns regarding tolerance, dependence, and abuse. Most evidence shows that the benefits of alprazolam in treating panic disorder last only 4 to 10 weeks. However, people with panic disorder have been treated on an open basis for up to 8 months without apparent loss of benefit.|$|E
50|$|<b>Panic</b> <b>Attack</b> turned X-Terminator 2 over, {{and due to}} a spike {{that was}} {{attached}} to the front, it couldn't self-right. <b>Panic</b> <b>Attack</b> pressed the pit button, and rolled X-Terminator back on its wheels. X-Terminator 2 then drove on top of <b>Panic</b> <b>Attack's</b> lifting forks, and <b>Panic</b> <b>Attack</b> slowly pushed X-Terminator into the pit. Winner: <b>Panic</b> <b>Attack.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Panic</b> <b>Attack</b> {{drove into}} Stinger, but {{found it hard}} to attack. Stinger used its axe on <b>Panic</b> <b>Attack's</b> sides and lifting mechanism. Stinger spun around and hit <b>Panic</b> <b>Attack</b> many times. <b>Panic</b> <b>Attack</b> pushed Stinger into Matilda, but went into the CPZ. <b>Panic</b> <b>Attack</b> then pushed Stinger into the arena wall, but the judges {{decision}} meant that Stinger was the winner, who finished 3rd overall.|$|R
50|$|SMIDSY rammed into <b>Panic</b> <b>Attack's</b> sides, {{and drove}} over the robot many times. <b>Panic</b> <b>Attack</b> then pushed SMIDSY into Shunt, but was caught itself by Dead Metal. <b>Panic</b> <b>Attack</b> then lifted SMIDSY {{and held it}} over the flame pit. Its fork had got stuck in SMIDSY's wheel opening, but <b>Panic</b> <b>Attack</b> managed to drag it around, {{eventually}} lowering SMIDSY in the pit.|$|R
5|$|Diagnosis of {{epilepsy}} can be difficult. A {{number of}} other conditions may present very similar signs and symptoms to seizures, including syncope, hyperventilation, migraines, narcolepsy, <b>panic</b> <b>attacks</b> and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES). In particular a syncope can {{be accompanied by a}} short episode of convulsions. Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, often misdiagnosed as nightmares, was considered to be a parasomnia but later identified to be an epilepsy syndrome. Attacks of the movement disorder paroxysmal dyskinesia may be taken for epileptic seizures. The cause of a drop attack can be, among many others, an atonic seizure.|$|E
5|$|The {{most potent}} {{are members of}} the genus Psilocybe, such as P.azurescens, P.semilanceata, and P.cyanescens, but {{psilocybin}} has also been isolated from about a dozen other genera. As a prodrug, psilocybin is quickly converted by the body to psilocin, which has mind-altering effects similar, in some aspects, to those of LSD, mescaline, and DMT. In general, the effects include euphoria, visual and mental hallucinations, changes in perception, a distorted sense of time, and spiritual experiences, and can include possible adverse reactions such as nausea and <b>panic</b> <b>attacks.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following Sean Connery's {{announcement}} {{that he would}} not play James Bond again, Eastwood was offered the role but turned it down because he believed the character should be played by an English actor. He next starred in the loner Western Joe Kidd (1972), based on a character inspired by Reies Lopez Tijerina, who stormed a courthouse in Tierra Amarilla, New Mexico in June 1967. During filming, Eastwood suffered symptoms of a bronchial infection and several <b>panic</b> <b>attacks.</b> Joe Kidd received a mixed reception, with Roger Greenspun of The New York Times writing that it was unremarkable, with foolish symbolism and sloppy editing, although he praised Eastwood's performance.|$|E
50|$|This {{was one of}} the {{greatest}} fights in the series. X-Terminator pushed <b>Panic</b> <b>Attack</b> around using its axe, but then <b>Panic</b> <b>Attack</b> slammed X-Terminator into the arena wall. The CO2 canister was punctured, rendering X-T's weapons and self-righting mechanism useless, which allowed <b>Panic</b> <b>Attack</b> to flip X-Terminator over. The house robots then moved in and <b>attacked</b> X-Terminator. Winner: <b>Panic</b> <b>Attack.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Panic</b> <b>Attack</b> {{drove into}} Overkill. SMIDSY then got under Overkill, and Overkill flipped it later. <b>Panic</b> <b>Attack</b> wedged Overkill {{into the arena}} spike, and lifted it, before it was rammed by SMIDSY. <b>Panic</b> <b>Attack</b> lifted Overkill again onto the arena wall. Both <b>Panic</b> <b>Attack</b> and SMIDSY then pushed Overkill into the CPZ, and lifted it. It went to a judges {{decision}} and Overkill GTI was eliminated.|$|R
50|$|When using a bomb, player fires {{missiles}} towards stage boss. <b>Panic</b> <b>attack</b> {{power is}} increased by repeatedly using bomb stock before the ongoing <b>panic</b> <b>attack</b> is completed. <b>Panic</b> <b>attack's</b> power can reach level 5. At least level 3 {{is needed to}} slow down enemies.|$|R
5|$|In several seasons, contestants {{have been}} cast but {{ultimately}} withdrew {{before the game}} began: a 20th contestant, Mellisa McNulty was originally cast in , but dropped out and returned home {{the night before the}} show began because of <b>panic</b> <b>attacks,</b> while in , the 19th and 20th contestants, So and Doo Kim a related couple, were removed just before filming due to a medical emergency. In both cases, the removed contestants were unreplaced. Fiji and San Juan del Sur proceeded with an uneven gender balance. This occurrence made Fiji the only season {{in the history of the}} show to have an odd number of players.|$|E
5|$|Wesley awakens in {{a factory}} {{surrounded}} by Fox and other assassins. The group's leader, Sloan, forces Wesley at gunpoint to shoot the wings off of several flies, which he does, much to Wesley's shock. Sloan explains that Wesley's <b>panic</b> <b>attacks</b> are actually a rare ability {{that allows him to}} distribute massive amounts of adrenaline to his brain,slowing his perception of his surroundings and granting him superhuman strength and speed. He reveals that Wesley's father, as well as Cross, were members of the Fraternity, a society of assassins that maintains balance in the world. Sloan wants to train him so that he may help kill Cross.|$|E
5|$|Years later, {{six months}} after the Battle of New York, Stark's {{experiences}} during the alien invasion are giving him <b>panic</b> <b>attacks.</b> Restless, he has built several dozen Iron Man suits, creating friction with his girlfriend Pepper Potts. Meanwhile, a string of bombings by a terrorist known only as the Mandarin has left intelligence agencies bewildered by a lack of forensic evidence. Stark's security chief Happy Hogan is badly injured in a Mandarin attack, causing Stark to issue a televised threat to the Mandarin, who responds by destroying Stark's home with helicopter gunships. Hansen, who came to warn Stark, survives the attack along with Potts. Stark escapes in an Iron Man suit, which his artificial intelligence J.A.R.V.I.S. pilots to rural Tennessee, following a flight plan from Stark's investigation into the Mandarin. Stark's experimental armor lacks sufficient power to return to California, and the world believes him dead.|$|E

5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are used}} recreationally and by {{problematic}} drug misusers. Mortality is higher among poly-drug misusers that also use benzodiazepines. Heavy alcohol use also increases mortality among poly-drug users. Dependence and tolerance, often coupled with dosage escalation, to benzodiazepines can develop rapidly among drug misusers; withdrawal syndrome may appear after {{as little as}} three weeks of continuous use. Long-term use {{has the potential to}} cause both physical and psychological dependence and severe withdrawal symptoms such as depression, anxiety (often to the point of <b>panic</b> <b>attacks),</b> and agoraphobia. Benzodiazepines and, in particular, temazepam are sometimes used intravenously, which, if done incorrectly or in an unsterile manner, can lead to medical complications including abscesses, cellulitis, thrombophlebitis, arterial puncture, deep vein thrombosis, and gangrene. Sharing syringes and needles for this purpose also brings up the possibility of transmission of hepatitis, HIV, and other diseases. Benzodiazepines are also misused intranasally, which may have additional health consequences. Once benzodiazepine dependence has been established, a clinician usually converts the patient to an equivalent dose of diazepam before beginning a gradual reduction program.|$|E
25|$|Limited symptom {{attacks are}} similar to <b>panic</b> <b>attacks,</b> but have fewer symptoms. Most people with PD {{experience}} both <b>panic</b> <b>attacks</b> and limited symptom attacks.|$|E
25|$|Tobacco smoking {{increases}} the risk of developing panic disorder with or without agoraphobia and panic attacks; smoking started in adolescence or early adulthood particularly increases this risk of developing panic disorder. While the mechanism of how smoking increases <b>panic</b> <b>attacks</b> is not fully understood, a few hypotheses have been derived. Smoking cigarettes may lead to <b>panic</b> <b>attacks</b> by causing changes in respiratory function (e.g. feeling short of breath). These respiratory changes in turn can lead to the formation of <b>panic</b> <b>attacks,</b> as respiratory symptoms are a prominent feature of panic. Respiratory abnormalities have been found in children with high levels of anxiety, which suggests that a person with these difficulties may be susceptible to <b>panic</b> <b>attacks,</b> and thus more likely to subsequently develop panic disorder. Nicotine, a stimulant, could contribute to <b>panic</b> <b>attacks.</b> However, nicotine withdrawal may also cause significant anxiety which could contribute to <b>panic</b> <b>attacks.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the Gauntlet, <b>Panic</b> <b>Attack</b> {{advanced}} {{exactly the}} same distance as Mace, meaning that the two had to run the course again at the same time. Mace was subsequently trapped and pitted by the Sentinel, putting <b>Panic</b> <b>Attack</b> through. In the trial, <b>Panic</b> <b>Attack</b> advanced through Pinball. In the semi-final battle, it beat the favourites Mortis by putting it into the pit.|$|R
50|$|In the Heat Final, Terrorhurtz {{continuously}} hit <b>Panic</b> <b>Attack</b> {{with their}} axe {{until it was}} immobilised. After having been counted out, <b>Panic</b> <b>Attack</b> had its top struck off by Matilda's flywheel.|$|R
50|$|The {{team also}} entered <b>Panic</b> <b>Attack</b> {{in one season}} of Battlebots, losing out to Frenzy. They {{returned}} next season with Scallywag, a wedge-shaped lifter with a colour scheme similar to <b>Panic</b> <b>Attack.</b>|$|R
25|$|Panic {{disorder}} sufferers {{usually have}} a series of intense episodes of extreme anxiety during <b>panic</b> <b>attacks.</b> These attacks typically last about ten minutes, and can be as short-lived as 1–5 minutes, but can last twenty minutes to more than an hour, or until helpful intervention is made. <b>Panic</b> <b>attacks</b> can wax and wane for a period of hours (<b>panic</b> <b>attacks</b> rolling into one another), and the intensity and specific symptoms of panic may vary over the duration.|$|E

50|$|<b>Panic</b> <b>Attack</b> won its Eliminator for the Grand Final by immobilising Killertron, and {{subsequently}} pushed Sgt. Bash into the pit. In the final itself, <b>Panic</b> <b>Attack</b> avoided being flipped by Cassius, {{and pushed it}} into the pit for a shock victory.|$|R
25|$|Panic {{disorder}} is an anxiety disorder characterized by recurrent unexpected <b>panic</b> <b>attacks.</b> <b>Panic</b> <b>attacks</b> are sudden periods of intense fear that may include palpitations, sweating, shaking, shortness of breath, numbness, or {{a feeling that}} something really bad is going to happen. The maximum degree of symptoms occurs within minutes. There may be ongoing worries about having further attacks and avoidance of places where attacks {{have occurred in the}} past.|$|E
25|$|Deacon and Valentiner (2000) {{conducted}} a study that examined co-morbid <b>panic</b> <b>attacks</b> and substance use in a non-clinical sample of young adults who experienced regular <b>panic</b> <b>attacks.</b> The authors found that compared to healthy controls, therapeutic alcohol and sedative use was greater for non-clinical participants who experienced <b>panic</b> <b>attacks.</b> These {{findings are consistent with}} the suggestion made by Cox, Norton, Dorward, and Fergusson (1989) that panic disorder patients self-medicate if they believe that certain substances will be successful in alleviating their symptoms. If panic disorder patients are indeed self-medicating, there may be a portion of the population with undiagnosed panic disorder who will not seek professional help {{as a result of their}} own self-medication. In fact, for some patients panic disorder is only diagnosed after they seek treatment for their self-medication habit.|$|E
25|$|Substance {{abuse is}} often {{correlated}} with <b>panic</b> <b>attacks.</b> The majority of individuals {{participating in a}} study determined (63%) of those abusing alcohol reported that alcohol use began prior to the onset of panic, and the majority (59%) of those abusing illicit drugs reported that drug use began first. The study that was conducted documented the panic-substance abuse relationship. Substance abuse began prior to onset of panic and substances were used to self-medicate for <b>panic</b> <b>attacks</b> by only a few subjects.|$|E
