25|$|During a brief {{transitional}} period (c. 1950s–1990s), photographic technology, known as phototypesetting, utilized tiny high-resolution images of individual glyphs {{on a film}} strip (in {{the form of a}} film negative, with the letters as clear areas on an opaque black background). A high-intensity light source behind the film strip projected the image of each glyph through an optical system, which focused the desired letter onto the light-sensitive phototypesetting paper at a specific size and position. This photographic typesetting process permitted optical scaling, allowing designers to produce multiple sizes from a single font, although physical constraints on the reproduction system used still required design changes at different sizes; for example, ink traps and spikes to allow for spread of ink encountered in the printing stage. Manually operated <b>photocomposition</b> systems using fonts on filmstrips allowed fine kerning between letters without the physical effort of manual typesetting, and spawned an enlarged type design industry in the 1960s and 1970s.|$|E

5000|$|Casual scripts show a less formal, {{more active}} hand. The strokes may vary in width but often {{appear to have}} been created by wet brush rather than a pen nib. They appear {{in the early twentieth century}} and with the advent of <b>photocomposition</b> in the early-1950s their number rapidly increased. They were popularly used in {{advertising}} in Europe and North America into the 1970s. Examples of casual script types include Brush Script, Kaufmann and Mistral. Some may be non-connecting.|$|E
5000|$|The {{move from}} {{so-called}} ‘hot-type’ to ‘cold-type’ typesetting (<b>photocomposition)</b> streamlined {{the production process}} and allowed newspapers to be printed {{much more quickly than}} in the past. It was local newspapers rather than the nationals which were ‘leading the computer revolution’ in the industry. By managing this process in Portsmouth, Galpin [...] "guided the destinies of both daily and weekly newspapers into an era of clarity of print which was inconceivable at the threshold of his career".|$|E
50|$|Galpin {{was made}} an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1977 for his {{services}} to the newspaper industry. As General Manager (South) and a Director of the Portsmouth and Sunderland Newspapers, Galpin was responsible for introducing web offset printing to the Portsmouth Evening News and managing the newspaper’s move to its Hilsea location in 1969. This made the newspaper the first newspaper {{in the world with}} a circulation of over 100,000 copies to use computerised printing technology and colour <b>photocomposition.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Wexler {{was among}} the {{original}} artists to adopt digital image editing technology as a tool in the creative process. During 1987 Wexler was introduced to digital imaging technology by Tony Redhead, who in 1986 founded Electric Paint, the first U.S. company to use digital imaging technology and a Quantel Paintbox to create digital transparencies for print. [...] During 1992 Glen Wexler Studio established in-house digital imaging using Apple Inc. computers, and began employing full-time digital artists {{to assist with the}} retouching and <b>photocomposition</b> of Wexler’s projects.|$|E
5000|$|In June, 1971, {{again at}} McCormick Place, the company {{announced}} {{a variation of the}} Astrotype product at the National Printing Equipment show. [...] The new product, called Astrocomp, was directed at the printing and publishing industry. Its primary function was the original typing and subsequent editing of text intended to be set into type, either on a Linotype machine or on <b>photocomposition</b> equipment from manufacturers such as AM/Varityper, Merganthaler, and the Compugraphic Corporation. The Astrocomp product produced punched paper tape or magnetic tape that contained both the text and codes needed to drive these devices.|$|E
50|$|American Typewriter is a {{slab serif}} {{typeface}} created in 1974 by Joel Kaden and Tony Stan for International Typeface Corporation. It {{is based on}} the slab serif style of typewriters; however, unlike most true typewriter fonts, it is a proportional design: the characters do not all have the same width. American Typewriter is often used to suggest an old-fashioned or industrial image. It was originally released in cold type (<b>photocomposition)</b> before being released digitally. Like many ITC fonts, it has a range of four weights from light to bold (with matching italics) and separate condensed styles. Some releases do not have italics.|$|E
50|$|By the mid 1980s, Linotype {{adopted the}} redrawn DIN typefaces for digital <b>photocomposition.</b> Together with Adobe they {{released}} it as DIN Mittelschrift and DIN Engschrift in 1990. Thus the typefaces {{became part of}} the Adobe/Linotype PostScript typeface library. The use of DIN typefaces started to appear in the work of cutting edge graphic designers and design studios such as Uwe Loesch in Germany, Tel Design in the Netherlands as well as David Carson and April Greiman in the USA. Soon other leading designers began using DIN Mittelschrift and Engschrift, making it a popular option to other sans serif faces.|$|E
50|$|In 1967 Ed Benguiat {{licensed}} {{the design}} from ATF and re-drew the {{face for the}} Photo-Lettering Corporation. When the International Typeface Corporation (ITC) was formed in 1971 it not only issued this design as ITC Souvenir but hired Benguiat to draw additional weights. He even added swashes for each variant, thus increasing its attractiveness. It was the bold and demi-bold weights that subsequently achieved a ubiquitous popularity, leading to it being made available for <b>photocomposition</b> by all the leading producers under the name Souvenir by Alphatype, Berthold, Compugraphic, Dymo, Harris, Star/Photon, Mergenthaler, Monotype, Varityper, while it was called Sovran by Graphic Systems Inc.|$|E
50|$|From the 1960s, Letterpress {{printing}} {{started to}} decline {{in favor of}} Offset printing. New procedures of text composition appeared—first <b>photocomposition</b> and then desktop publishing from digital sources—which were more rational than those using lead types. But, despite the odds, the Neufville Typefoundry managed to maintain a strong production of lead types through acquisitions of prominent foundries: Fundición Tipográfica Nacional in 1971, the Bauer Type Foundry in 1972, Fonderie Typographique Française in 1974, matrices of the Lettergieterij Amsterdam in 1984, Ludwig & Mayer in 1985, and Fonderies Tyographiques Réunies del Líbano (United Type Foundries of Lebanon) in 1988. In 1974, it opened a branch near Paris, Neufville France, to supply lead types to France, Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia, an activity that lasted until 1995.|$|E
50|$|In {{graphic design}} too, {{long before the}} use of the word ‘retro’, {{referencing}} to earlier graphic characteristics was done. William Morris can be seen as an example, for i.a. book design he adopted Medieval production and stylistic models in 1891. Furthermore, in the beginning of the twentieth century, Gothic, Baroque and Rococo motifs were used for new products. In typography classicism has always been an influence and throughout the 20th century, early woodcut printing too. The introduction of the technique of <b>photocomposition</b> to typesetting in the 1960s allowed typographers greater flexibility in the selection and arrangement of type styles and sizes. For example, psychedelic typefaces were developed gaining inspiration from Art Nouveau and other cultures. Historicist styles are also used is in the promotion and packaging of food and household products, referring to childhood memories and domestic nostalgic ideals.|$|E
50|$|By late 1992, the {{new draft}} of Li Fanwen's Tangut-Chinese {{dictionary}} was almost complete, {{but he was}} not satisfied with the system of phonetic reconstruction that he was using, so after the Taiwan Tangutologist Gong Hwang cherng came to see him, he decided to use Professor Gong's system of phonetic reconstruction instead. The dictionary was now complete, but technical and financial issues delayed its publication until 1997. Originally, Li Fanwen had hoped to computer typeset the Tangut text, but eventually he had to abandon this plan, and the Tangut text in the 1997 edition was laboriously inserted using <b>photocomposition.</b> The dictionary comprised exactly 6,000 Tangut characters, and these 6,000 characters were later used as the source for the Mojikyo set of Tangut characters, which have since been widely used by Tangutologists for typesetting Tangut text. In 2002, the dictionary won the Wu Yuzhang Prize for Humanities and Social Sciences.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{earliest}} electronic <b>photocomposition</b> systems was introduced by Fairchild Semiconductor. The typesetter typed a line of text on a Fairchild keyboard that had no display. To verify correct content of the line it was typed a second time. If the two lines were identical a bell rang and the machine produced a punched paper tape corresponding to the text. With {{the completion of a}} block of lines the typesetter fed the corresponding paper tapes into a phototypesetting device that mechanically set type outlines printed on glass sheets into place for exposure onto a negative film. Photosensitive paper was exposed to light through the negative film, resulting in a column of black type on white paper, or a galley. The galley was then cut up and used to create a mechanical drawing or paste up of a whole page. A large film negative of the page is shot and used to make plates for offset printing.|$|E
5000|$|A venture {{was made}} into <b>photocomposition</b> with the ATF Hadego Typesetter. Introduced in 1958, the first model was the [...] "A". Not many were {{produced}} because the character fit left much to be desired. The most common model was the [...] "B". Character fit was improved by employing the Friden Flexowriter [...] "Justowriter" [...] escape mechanism to six units. The last and most advanced model based on the Friden mechanism was the [...] "B-8", where an eighth unit {{was added to the}} escape mechanism by means of a series of electro-mechanical relays that could add the eighth unit to some wider characters, like capital [...] "M", without changing the basic mechanical escape mechanism of the model [...] "B". The last phototypesetter designed and produced by ATF was the Photocomp 20, so named because of its rated speed of twenty 11-pica newspaper lines per minute. It featured four stepper motors (1) to move the film across, (2) to move the type disk, (3) to advance the film to the next line, and (4) to set the size of one unit of escapement. Type disks contained four fonts, each including 17 pi characters. Its controller was the first ATF controller utilizing integrated circuits in place of relays. Circuitry was based on Motorola DTL integrated circuits. Machine styling of the Photocomp 20 was by Richard Arbib. Only 17 machines were sold: one in Vienna Austria, and the remainder in North America.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Compugraphic {{introduced}} the 7200 and 2900 <b>photocomposition</b> machines. Prepared by a computer, a tape would be fed into a phototypesetter, which would imprint type from {{a strip of}} film onto Kodak-made Ektamatic (light-sensitive) paper, which would then be used for paste up. As the development of its systems progressed, Compugraphic continually included new technology such as larger CRT monitors, floppy-disk storage, and screen preview capabilities. Its most prolific product was the EditWriter, which could image onto photo paper up to 8 inches wide, could create type in sizes from 6 to 72 points by using various fixed lenses mounted on an internal turret, and stored information on 8" [...] floppy disks.Following {{the success of the}} EditWriter, Compugraphic introduced the Modular Composition System, known as the [...] "MCS". The entire system was modular, including the software, which was delivered on 5" [...] floppy disks. As the product matured, a [...] "WYSIWYG" [...] display was added (the PreView) so that a user could see a [...] "soft" [...] view of a job before it was typeset. This was followed up by the PowerView whereby the user worked directly on a [...] "WSIWYG" [...] display. The MCS was a huge success, and also marked a change in technology from 8bit to 16bit (Intel 8086) cpu hardware.Offered along with the MCS input side were 3 output devices: The top of the line 8600 CRT typesetter, the smaller 8400 CRT typesetter, and the entry level 8200. The 8600 was remarkable in many ways, but foremost was its digital font processor system using a dedicated AMD bit-sliced processing system. This with its wide flat CRT made it a remarkably fast output device. Digitized fonts were encrypted to the individual machine, a feature of digital typefaces up until emergence of desktop publishing. The 8400 was a lower cost CRT machine, replacing the rather expensive 8" [...] (and later 12") wide CRT of the 8600, with a small moveable 5" [...] CRT that was positioned across its printing window as required. The low-cost 8200 was based on [...] "spinning-font" [...] and xenon flash-tube technology, very similar to the deprecated EditWriter and Compuwriter products. 8200 typefaces were images on a spinning disk, and a flash-tube fired at the appropriate moment to generate an image on the typesetting media. Most of this machine was made of plastic parts and were not unknown to break or warp.Compugraphic also offered a version of CPM/86 runnable on the MCS hardware, along with WordStar, CalcStar and an accounting package.|$|E
