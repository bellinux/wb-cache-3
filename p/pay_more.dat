To help mediate the impact of the total fare increase on Anacostia residents, WMATA reduced basic bus fares for many routes in the area from $1 to 35 cents.|$|E

5|$|All trips {{made with}} a SmarTrip card, with the {{exception}} of bus transfers and passes, are charged as individual one-way fares. WMATA offers discounted rail and bus passes to customers who make several trips in one day, or many trips, or many short trips, in a seven-day period or calendar month; however, SmarTrip users must manually load each transit pass onto their SmarTrip cards or sign up for an autoload of the pass in advance. This is in contrast to the Oyster card system on the London Underground, for example, where fares are automatically capped to ensure that customers never <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> than the cost of a one-day pass each day.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the initial}} {{popularity}} of the PowerBook100 did not last. Sales decreased, and by December 1991 the 140 and 170 models had become more popular because customers were willing to <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> for a built-in floppy disk drive and second serial port, which the PowerBook100 lacked. By August 10, 1992, Apple quietly dropped the PowerBook100 from its price list but continued to sell existing stock through its own dealers and alternative discount consumer-oriented stores such as Price Club. In these stores, a 4MB RAM/40MB hard drive configuration with a floppy drive sold for less than $1,000 (more than $1,500 less than the similar 2MB/20MB configuration's original list price).|$|E

5|$|Prior to a {{government}} report being presented on 30 March 1993, SAS had launched 1 November 1993 as their preferred date of free competition, while Braathens SAFE had launched 1 April 1997 as their preferred date. Braaathens SAFE was worried that the high debt the company had due to the purchase of new aircraft would make them illiquid in a price war. Bjørn G. Braathen stated {{that the company had}} bought the new aircraft {{based on the belief that}} deregulation would occur in 1997, giving the airline time to <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> of the debt. On 2 June 1993, with 76 against 18 votes, parliament voted to deregulate the domestic airline market from 1 April 1994. It was supported by the Labor, Conservative and Progress Party. With this, Norway became the third country in Europe to fully deregulate, after Sweden and the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Strongly built, {{and compact}} yet elegant, Andalusians have long, thick manes and tails. Their most common coat color is gray, {{although}} {{they can be}} found in many other colors. They are known for their intelligence, sensitivity and docility. A sub-strain within the breed known as the Carthusian, is considered by breeders to be the purest strain of Andalusian, though there is no genetic evidence for this claim. The strain is still considered separate from the main breed however, and is preferred by breeders because buyers <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> for horses of Carthusian bloodlines. There are several competing registries keeping records of horses designated as Andalusian or PRE, but they differ on their definition of the Andalusian and PRE, the purity of various strains of the breed, and the legalities of stud book ownership. At least one lawsuit is in progress , to determine the ownership of the Spanish PRE stud book.|$|E
5|$|The first {{service from}} Oslo to Stockholm ran on 16 June 2002. Initially {{there were only}} three daily {{services}}, but later that year, two more daily services were introduced. At the same time, travel time was reduced by 20 minutes, as the trains stopped at only three intermediate stations. Linx operated with different prices on the same route, depending on if the ticket was bought in Norway or Sweden. The company stated that this was in part because of a strong Norwegian krone, in part because Norwegians were willing to <b>pay</b> <b>more,</b> and in part because the sales system in Sweden was more automated.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{insurance system}} devised by McGivney gave a deceased Knight's widow a $1,000 death benefit. Each member was assessed $1 upon a death, {{and when the}} number of Knights grew beyond 1,000, the assessment decreased according to the rate of increase. Each member, regardless of age, was assessed equally. As a result, younger, healthier members could expect to <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> over the course of their lifetimes than those men who joined when they were older. There was also a Sick Benefit Deposit for members who fell ill and could not work. Each sick Knight was entitled to draw up to $5 a week for 13 weeks (roughly equivalent to $125.75 in 2009 dollars). If he remained sick after that, the council to which he belonged determined the sum of money given to him.|$|E
5|$|In 2000 the Arden Group {{settled with}} One Meridian Plaza's owners E/R Partners to <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> than US$13 {{million for the}} site. In 1999 Arden sued E/R Partners for backing out of a deal Arden said it had made with the site owners. E/R Partners had wanted to sell the site to Liberty Property Trust for a higher amount. Arden had already bought the {{adjacent}} Two Mellon Plaza in 1993. Damaged and vacant since the One Meridian Plaza fire, Two Mellon Plaza was converted into a Ritz-Carlton hotel in 2000. Also adjacent to {{the south side of}} the One Meridian Plaza site is 1441 Chestnut Street. Mariner Commercial Properties bought the property which contained the site of several three-story shops and the eighteen-story Morris Building, all damaged and vacant due to the One Meridian Plaza fire. The buildings were demolished in 2000. The north side of the One Meridian plaza site faces Philadelphia City Hall across the street. While the One Meridian Plaza site waited for development Arden converted it into an underground parking garage.|$|E
5|$|In {{efficiency}} wage models, {{workers are}} paid at levels that maximize productivity instead of clearing the market. For example, in developing countries, firms might <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> than a market rate {{to ensure their}} workers can afford enough nutrition to be productive. Firms might also pay higher wages to increase loyalty and morale, possibly leading to better productivity. Firms can also pay higher than market wages to forestall shirking. Shirking models were particularly influential. Carl Shapiro and Joseph Stiglitz (1984) created a model where employees tend to avoid work unless firms can monitor worker effort and threaten slacking employees with unemployment. If the economy is at full employment, a fired shirker simply moves to a new job. Individual firms pay their workers a premium over the market rate to ensure their workers would rather work and keep their current job instead of shirking and risk having {{to move to a}} new job. Since each firm pays more than market clearing wages, the aggregated labor market fails to clear. This creates a pool of unemployed laborers and adds to the expense of getting fired. Workers not only risk a lower wage, they risk being stuck in the pool of unemployed. Keeping wages above market clearing levels creates a serious disincentive to shirk that makes workers more efficient even though it leaves some willing workers unemployed.|$|E

5|$|Norway Airlines was {{established}} on 2 April 1987 by Kjell Adserø and his holding company Hell Holding, {{along with several}} other investors from Trøndelag—the largest of which was Lyng Industrier. The business model was to operate charter flights from Norway to the Mediterranean; {{eighty percent of the}} market was carried out with foreign airlines and Adserø believed that Norwegians not only would prefer a Norwegian carrier, but would be willing to <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> for one. The company had an initial share capital of NOK10 million and established its head office and main base at Stavanger Airport, Sola. Separate companies, organized as kommandittselskap, wer established to own each aircraft and lease them to the airline. The aircraft owner companies paid 28.7 million United States dollars for each Boeing 737-300, which were delivered new from Boeing Commercial Airplanes. Shares in the aircraft owning companies was offered to the public with a four-percent annual return on investment. Part of the investment model was based on tax advantages.|$|E
5|$|The Fourth Round held First Division club Cardiff City in snowy {{conditions}} at Ninian Park. Vale won 2–0, and their victory was {{aided by the}} fact that Cardiff goalkeeper Ron Howells had to leave the pitch after 20 minutes after being knocked out following a collision with defender Derrick Sullivan, leaving his ten-man team to play 70 minutes with defender Alf Sherwood in goal. Vale attacked through the wings to get in numerous crosses to the box, from which Ken Griffiths and Albert Leake scored their goals. Centre-half Tommy Cheadle restricted centre-forward Trevor Ford to a quiet game, and at full-time the pair were full of bruises but still left the pitch with a handshake and a smile. Cardiff placed a £25,000 transfer bid for winger Colin Askey, and after their offer was rejected Cardiff stated they were prepared to <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> than £25,000, but Port Vale refused any negotiations. Other top clubs also made inquiries, but were all turned away.|$|E
