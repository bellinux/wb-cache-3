He reiterated the points he had made regarding Formosa: that while depicting a fallen woman as glamourous or noble might lead impressionable readers to vice, a true depiction of such a woman's misery might deter readers from yielding to temptation; and might soften the hearts of <b>parents</b> <b>whose</b> daughters have fallen, and thus afford an opportunity of returning to decency.|$|E

25|$|A {{key factor}} was the disinterest of the <b>parents,</b> <b>whose</b> main {{motivation}} for sending {{their children to}} the Scoletas appears to have been that they were looked after for a few hours and given a meal every day, rather than an interest in preserving Romansh. The other factor was that after entering primary school, the children received a few hours a week of Romansh instruction at best. As a result, the last Scoletas were closed in the 1960s with the exception of Präz, where the Scoleta remained open until 1979.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} studies have been {{conducted}} to measure a number of chemicals associated with informal e-waste recycling in the populations. One study enrolled children from Guiyu and a control site 50km away to measure blood lead levels (BLLs). The average BLL in Guiyu was 15.3ug/dL compared to 9.9ug/dL in the control site. In the United States, the CDC has set a reference level for blood lead at 5ug/dL. High levels of lead in young children can impact IQ and the development of the central nervous system. The highest concentrations of lead were found in the children of <b>parents</b> <b>whose</b> workshop dealt with circuit boards and the lowest was among those who recycled plastic.|$|E

25|$|In July 2008, {{local governments}} in the Sichuan Province coordinated a {{campaign}} to silence angry <b>parents</b> <b>whose</b> children died during the earthquake through monetary contracts. If the parents refused, officials threatened that they would receive nothing. Although Chinese officials have advocated a policy of openness in time before the Olympic Games, the pressure on parents to sign demonstrates that officials are determined to create an appearance of public harmony rather than investigate into the corruption or negligence {{of the construction of}} schools. The payment amounts vary by school but are roughly the same. In Hanwang, parents were offered a package valued at 8,800 USD in cash and a per-parent pension of nearly 5,600 USD. Many parents said they signed the contract, even if no real investigation ensues. Furthermore, officials have continued to use traditional methods of silencing: riot police officers have broken up protests by parents; the authorities have set up cordons around the schools; and officials have ordered the Chinese news media to stop reporting on school collapses.|$|E

2500|$|A {{number of}} details about Jean Lafitte's early life remain obscure - often they {{contradict}} each other.

Other contemporary accounts claim that Lafitte was born in Orduna, Spain or in Westchester, New York.|$|E

Philip Dykes, for the applicant, argued that because Vallejos and Domingo's case would touch on issues of interpretation of the Basic Law under Article 158, Liang's interests would also be affected. In rejecting Liang's application, Ma stated: [...] "We feel that the points you seem to argue are adequately covered and will be adequately covered".

30|$|Associations between parental {{education}} and science skills are significant as well, {{as shown in}} model 2.

In February 2011, she hosted the 36th César Awards in France, and the following month released her third feature film direction, The Beaver (2011), about a depressed man who develops an alternative personality based on a beaver hand puppet. It starred Maverick co-star Mel Gibson and featured herself, Anton Yelchin and Jennifer Lawrence in supporting roles as his family. Foster called its production [...] "probably the biggest struggle of my professional career", {{partly due to the}} film's heavy subject matter but also due to the controversy that developed around Gibson as he was accused of domestic violence and making anti-semitic, racist, and sexist statements. The film received mixed reviews, and failed the box office, largely due to the controversy surrounding its star. In 2011, Foster also appeared as part of an ensemble cast with John C.
