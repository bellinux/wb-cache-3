40|$|A {{continuously}} mixed, aseptic <b>paddle</b> <b>mixer</b> {{was used}} successfully for solid-state fermentation (SSF) with Aspergillus oryzae on whole wheat kernels. Continuous mixing improved temperature control and prevented inhomogeneities in the bed. Respiration rates {{found in this}} system were comparable to those in small, isothermal, unmixed beds, which showed that continuous mixing did not cause serious damage to the fungus or the wheat kernels. Continuous mixing improves heat transport to the bioreactor wall, which reduces the need for evaporative cooling and thus may help to prevent the desiccation problems that hamper large-scale SSF. However, scale-up calculations for the <b>paddle</b> <b>mixer</b> indicated that wall cooling becomes insufficient at the 2 -m 3 scale for a rapidly growing fungus like Aspergillus oryzae. Consequently, evaporative cooling will remain important in large-scale mixed systems. Experiments showed that water addition will be necessary when evaporative cooling is applied {{in order to maintain}} a sufficiently high water activity of the solid substrate. Mixing is necessary to ensure homogeneous water addition in SSF. Automated process control might be achieved using the enthalpy balance. The enthalpy balance for the case of evaporative cooling in the <b>paddle</b> <b>mixer</b> was validated. This work shows that continuous mixing provides promising possibilities for simultaneous control of temperature and moisture content in solid-state fermentation on a large scale...|$|E

40|$|Aggregates {{generated}} {{in water and}} wastewater treatment systems and those found in natural systems are fractal and therefore have different scaling properties than assumed in settling velocity calculations using Stokes' law. In order to demonstrate that settling velocity models based on impermeable spheres do not accurately relate aggregate size, porosity and settling velocity for highly porous fractal aggregates, we generated fractal aggregates by coagulation of latex microspheres in <b>paddle</b> <b>mixers</b> and analyzed each aggregate individually for its size, porosity, and settling velocity. Settling velocities of these aggregates were on average 4 - 8. 3 times higher than those predicted using either an impermeable sphere model (Stokes' law) or a permeable sphere model that specified aggregate permeability for a homogeneous distribution of particles within an aggregate. Fractal dimensions (D) derived from size-porosity relationships for the three batches of aggregates were 1. 78 ± 0. 10, 2. 19 ± 0. 12 and 2. 25 ± 0. 10. These fractal dimensions were used to predict power law relationships between aggregate size and settling velocity based on Stokes' law. When {{it was assumed that}} the drag coefficient, C(D), was constant and fixed at its value of C(D) = 24 /Re for the creeping flow region (Re 2. As a result, when D < 2, aggregate porosities will be overestimated and fractal dimensions will be calculated incorrectly from settling velocity data and Stokes' law. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The high-shear {{colloidal}} mixer, pioneered over 60 years ago, is {{internationally recognized}} as the most efficient method of mixing cement based grouts. Only recently, however, has this technology been applied {{to the production of}} cemented rockfill (CRF) for use in underground mines in North America. Traditionally, <b>paddle</b> type <b>mixers</b> have been used to produce the cement based slurries required for the preparation of cemented rockfills. While considerable success has been achieved with these mixers, tremendous advantages are attained with the colloidal mixer. The combined effect of the highly efficient mixing action and the ability to mix low water/solids ratios allows for reductions in the cement content for a given strength requirement. Cement can also be replaced by cheaper fillers such as flyash or PFA resulting in significant cost savings. Although large scale dedicated CRF plants are typical, there is a growing need for mobile plants capable of operating anywhere underground. The compact size and rapid batching speed of the high-shear colloidal mixers has allowed them to be incorporated into skid mounted systems capable of producing and discharging cement based slurries onto rockfill aggregate for the production of CRF. In many cases run-of-mine development waste can be taken directly to a portable plant located near the dumping face and used as CRF aggregate thereby eliminating the cost of waste removal...|$|R

The model examines the mixing of solids dissolved in a liquid at room temperature. To visualize the process of distributing the mixture particles over the cross-section and analyzing the mixing efficiency, the Poincaréplot module of the COMSOL Multiphysics software environment was used. For the first time, a multi-physical stream of heterogeneous flow model has been developed that describes in detail the physical state of the fluid at all points of the considered section at the initial time, takes into account the design parameters of the channel (orientation, dimensions, material, etc.), specifies the laws of variation of the parameters at the boundaries of the calculated section in conditions of the wave change in the internal section of the working chamber-channel of the inductive peristaltic pumping unit {{under the influence of the}} energy of the magnetic field...|$|R

Aggregates generated in a <b>paddle</b> <b>mixer</b> and a rolling cylinder had D 3 fractal {{dimensions of}} 1. 92 ± 0. 04 and 1. 59 ± 0. 16, respectively, indicating rolling cylinder aggregates are more fractal than <b>paddle</b> <b>mixer</b> aggregates. Fractal dimensions of marine snow aggregates were determined from image analysis of in-situ aggregate photographs at two different research facilities. Fractal dimensions from the two facilities were equal, indicating this analysis technique is independent of equipment and analyst.

40|$|Characterisation of {{particle}} flow using Positron Emission Particle Tracking (PEPT) {{is based on}} tracking {{the position of a}} single particle in a dynamic system. Recent developments in PEPT have facilitated tracking multiple particles aiming at improvements in data representation. Nevertheless for systems with a wide residence time distribution and/or dead zone, the conditions for getting representative data which could reflect the bulk behaviour of the powders need to be analysed and specified. In the present work, an attempt is made to simulate PEPT experiments for a <b>paddle</b> <b>mixer</b> using Discrete Element Method (DEM), with a view to investigate the effect of increasing the number of tracers on their time-averaged velocity distribution and whether it can represent the data on whole population {{of particle}}s. The time averaged velocity distribution of the individual tracer particles (resembling simulated PEPT) is obtained and compared with the time averaged data on entire particle population. The DEM results indicate that for the investigated <b>paddle</b> <b>mixer,</b> it takes 251. s for one tracer to travel adequately in all the active space of the system. The instantaneous tracer velocity fluctuates around the average value obtained for all the particles, suggesting that the average tracer velocity is adequately representative of the average particle velocity in the system. The data of the PEPT experiment with one tracer with those of DEM with one tracer are in good agreement; however, DEM simulation suggests that increasing the number of tracers in the <b>paddle</b> <b>mixer</b> system does not influence the average velocity distribution. Furthermore, the velocity for all particles in the DEM shows a smooth distribution with a peak frequency of the velocity distribution that is lower than PEPT and DEM tracer. When tracking a single tracer in DEM or PEPT, it may not be detected to have zero velocity at any instant of time, whilst the data for all particles show that about 0. 3 % of particles are stagnant...|$|E

40|$|A {{soft metal}} with low wear {{resistance}} (6000 series aluminum), {{was used to}} minimize run time while maximizing wear rate. Two paddle configurations were tested, with the first four paddles after the augers replaced by the wear paddles. The first configuration was all flat paddles, with the first paddle not aligned with the augers and is consistent with present SPF mixer. The second configuration had helical paddles {{for the first three}} stages after the augers and a flat paddle at the fourth stage. The first helical paddle was aligned with the auger flight for the second configuration. The all flat paddle configuration wear rate was approximately double the wear rate of the helical paddles for the first two sets of paddles after the augers. For both configurations, there was little or no wear on the third and fourth paddle sets based on mass change, indicating that the fully wetted premix materials are much less abrasive than the un-wetted or partially wetted premix. Additionally, inspection of the wear surface of the paddles at higher magnification showed the flat paddles were worn much more than the helical and is consistent with the wear rates. Aligning the auger discharge flight with the first set of helical paddles was effective in reducing the wear rate as compared to the flat paddle configuration. Changing the paddle configuration from flat to helical resulted in a slight increase in rheological properties. Although, both tests produced grout-like material that is within the processing rage of the SPF, {{it should be noted that}} cement is not included in the premix and water was used rather than salt solution, which does affect the rheology of the fresh grout. The higher rheological properties from the helical wear test are most likely due to the reduced number of shearing <b>paddles</b> in the <b>mixer.</b> In addition, there is variation in the rheological data for each wear test. This is most likely due to the way that the dry feeds enter the mixer from the dry feeder. The premix is discharged from the hopper in an unsteady fashion, where irregular sized clumps were observed leaving the discharge of the auger, though the auger speed is constant...|$|R
40|$|The Saltstone Production Facility has a 10 -inch Readco-Kurimoto {{continuous}} mixer that mixes the premix dry feeds and low-level waste salt solution to make fresh (uncured) saltstone. Inspection of the mixer in January 2013 showed significant wear on the third, {{fourth and fifth}} paddle pairs after the conveying augers. A 2 -inch Readco-Kurimoto {{continuous mixer}} {{was used to test}} alternate paddle configurations for use in the 10 -inch mixer to decrease the wear rate on the paddles. Two wear tests were conducted to investigate a method of reducing wear on the <b>mixer</b> <b>paddles.</b> The first test (wear test 2 a) had a paddle configuration similar to the currently installed 10 -inch mixer in the SPF. This test established baseline wear. The second test (wear test 2 b) had a reconfigured paddle arrangement that replaced the flat paddles with helical paddles for paddle pairs 2 � 6 and aligned paddle pair 1 with the augers. The intent of the reconfiguration was to more effectively convey the partially wetted dry feeds through the transition region and into the liquid feed where paddle wear is reduced due to dry feeds and salt solution being mixed at the intended water to premix ratio. The design of the helical paddles provides conveyance through the transition region to the liquid feed inlet. The alignment with the auger is aimed to provide a smoother transition (minimizing the discontinuity between the auger and paddle pair 1) into the downstream paddles. A soft metal with low wear resistance (6000 series aluminum) was used for the wear testing paddles to determine wear patterns while minimizing run time and maximizing wear rate. For the two paddle configurations tested using the scaled 2 -inch Readco-Kurimoto continuous mixer, with the first six paddles after the augers replaced by the wear paddles and the remaining paddles were stainless steel. Since the 10 -inch SPF mixer is designed with the liquid inlet centered over paddle pairs 5 and 6, the scaled 2 -inch mixer was configured the same way. The wear rate from wear test 2 a was approximately double the wear rate from wear test 2 b for paddle pairs 4 and 5. For both configurations, there was little or no wear on paddle pairs 1, 2, 3 and 6 based on mass change, indicating that the un-wetted and fully wetted premix materials cause less wear than the partially wetted premix. Additionally, inspection of the wear surface of the paddles showed more deformation on the flat paddles than the helical paddles which was consistent with the wear rates. Aligning of the auger discharge flight with paddle pair 1 resulted in a lower wear rate paddle pair 1 rather than having them misaligned with the feed augers. During the paddle wear tests, polishing wear was observed on the inside barrel of the mixer. The polishing wear is evident on the upper housing clamshell and the lower housing clamshell primarily at paddle pairs 4 and 5, which is the transition region of the mixer. Wear on the mixer barrel increases the space between the paddles and the barrel, resulting in increased grout build up on the barrel. Since the mixer barrel cannot be reconfigured or replaced in the SPF, the method for mitigating wear on the barrel is to move the more viscous grout through the transition region as quickly as possible. In addition, the location of the liquid inlet does not allow for sufficient cleaning of the mixer since residual grout remains on paddle pairs 1 � 4. As the paddles continue to wear and the self-cleaning capability of the paddles is lost, the lack of sufficient flushing would aid in grout build up between the barrel and the paddles which could eventually lead to decreased throughput capacity of the dry feeds. Changing the paddle configuration from flat to helical resulted in no change to the rheological properties of the grout mixture. Both tests produced a grout that is within the processing range of the SPF. Based on the results of this testing, it is recommended for the currently installed SPF <b>mixer</b> that <b>paddle</b> pairs 1 through 6 be helical rather than flat, with the paddle pair 1 aligned with the feed augers in order to minimize the wear occurring in the SPF mixer. Based on the results of this testing, it is recommended that the mixer be inspected and critical measurements be taken whenever the SPF processing schedule allows in order to establish a wear rate of the 10 -inch <b>mixer</b> <b>paddles.</b> 5 Based on these measurements, the lifetime of paddles in the transition region can be established in order to set up a maintenance schedule for the mixer. Since replacing the entire mixer is very expensive and time intensive, replacing the worn paddles after a specific time period would allow for planned shutdowns as well as process optimization such that the mixer throughput is not compromised. In addition, further testing should be performed to determine an alternate liquid inlet location to better flush the mixer of residual grout at the end of processing. Sufficiently cleaning the mixer will help eliminate another potential source of wear. Another potential method for reducing the wear rate in the mixer is to reduce the mixer speed without affecting the throughput capacity. Since wear rate is a function of impact velocity of the grout and mixing paddles, testing could be done using the 2 -inch mixer determine the optimum mixer speed to reduce wear but not adversely impact facility operations (e. g. throughput capacity and grout properties) ...|$|R

For the mathematical description of the mixing process of animal feed ingredients in the presence of chemical reaction the system of differential equations of Academician V. V. Kafarov was used. Proposed by him hypothesis based on the theory of Markov’s processes stating that "any multicomponent mixture can be considered as the result of an iterative process of mixing the two components to achieve the desired uniformity of all the ingredients in the mixture" allows us to consider a process of mixing binary composition in a <b>paddle</b> <b>mixer</b> in the form of differential equations of two ingredients concentration numerous changes until it becomes a homogenous mixture.

Water losses caused by evaporation were calculated from water vapor measurements. Model parameters were determined using an experimental membrane-based model system, which mimicked the growth of A. oryzae on the wheat grains and permitted direct measurement of the fungal biomass dry weight and wet weight.

The fluid shear rate (G) and the aggregate fractal dimension (O) affected the collision frequency function (β) between fractal aggregates and small particles, resulting in β ~ G(1 - 0. 33 D).

Journal of Animal Science, 94, 76 - 76. doi: 10. 2527 /msasas 2016 - 163 Since the introduction of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) into the United States, feed {{has been identified as}} a vector of transmission between herds. As with other biological hazards, biosecurity at feed manufacturing facilities {{plays a key role in}} preventing cross-contamination of finished feeds. One potential method for reducing introduction of PEDV into finished feeds is through batch sequencing of diets. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the effects of feed batch sequencing on PEDV cross-contamination between diets. A 50 kg batch of feed was inoculated with PEDV, mixed in a 0. 11 m 3 electric <b>paddle</b> <b>mixer</b> and had a final concentration of 4. 5 × 104 TCID 50 PEDV particles per g, cycle threshold (Ct) of 11. After mixing, the feed was discharged from the mixer into a bucket elevator and collected to mimic processing in a commercial feed mill. To simulate batch sequencing, 4 subsequent PEDV-free batch diets were processed through the system without equipment cleaning. Sequenced batches (1 – 4) were mixed, discharged, and sampled similar to the PEDV-positive batch. Feed inoculation, processing, and batch sequencing was performed for 3 replicates with complete PEDV-decontamination of all equipment and facility between each replication. All collected feed samples were analyzed for PEDV RNA by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and infectivity by bioassay. Bioassay included a controlled challenge study using 30 crossbred 10 d old pigs to establish infectivity. All pigs (9 / 9) challenged with the positive treatment (feed Ct 31. 7 ± 0. 20 SEM) had fecal swabs with detectible PEDV RNA indicating PEDV infectivity. Infectivity was further confirmed with histopathology and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The discharge for the first sequence had less detectable PEDV RNA (P 45). Infectivity was confirmed in 1 of 3 replicate batches for the first and second sequences. It is important to note, the 2 ndsequence did not have detectable PEDV RNA in any feed sample. The results of this study confirm feed as a vector of PEDV transmission and is the first to demonstrate feed without detectible PEDV RNA can be infective. Furthermore, although subsequent feed batches had reduced quantities of PEDV RNA, they were still found to be infective. Therefore, feed batch sequencing should be considered a risk mitigation strategy but should not be considered a risk elimination strategy...|$|E
40|$|Systems of {{particles}} can be modeled {{in a number}} of ways. The discrete element method (DEM) is among the most detailed of all possible approaches. When using DEM, the trajectory of each and every particle is computed. Naturally, this comes at a high computational cost. At a more abstract, vessel scale level, population balance (PB) modeling is also used. In this approach a system of partial differential equations is written (similar to the conservation equations of mass, momentum, and energy) which describes the evolution of the distribution of particle properties (e. g., size, composition, and age). Unfortunately PB cannot directly account for the motion of material in a vessel in a computationally efficient manner. ^ In this work, a novel multi-scale modeling approach is presented in which DEM and PB models are combined via a compartment model (CM) to account for flow heterogeneity in a particle mixer-coater. Using this approach, the mixer is decomposed into bed and spray regions, and particle trajectories taken from the DEM model are used to generate an intermediate sub-CM that matches the residence time distributions {{of particles}} in these regions. A system of PB models is then generated from the CM. The CM presents a simplified, but still accurate description of the particle residence times in the regions of the mixer. A case study of a simple top spray coating system shows the method is 80 % faster than using DEM alone with 13 % of the error of using PB alone. Approaches to estimating the minimum DEM simulation time are also presented. Parametric studies are performed which demonstrate that as operating parameters of the mixer are varied, the CM structure remains and only the CM parameters change. This fact allows generation of a single CM structure for a given system. The method is applied to three mixer geometries: a dual-axis <b>paddle</b> <b>mixer,</b> a horizontal axis rotating drum, and a vertical axis mixer. ^ The approach is limited to systems in which the residence time in a region is statistically independent of the residence time in any other region. Also, a region’s residence time distribution must be able to be modeled in terms of a network of ideal compartments. The mixer flow must also have reached a steady state so that each region’s residence time distributions does not vary with time. Within these constraints, the multi-scale modeling approach developed in this thesis is capable of drastically reducing computational time and increasing total process understand via the reduction of a full DEM simulation to a simple CM. ...|$|E

Journal of Animal Science, 94, 77 - 77. doi: 10. 2527 /msasas 2016 - 164 With the introduction of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) to the United States in 2013 and the subsequent identification of feed as a route of transmission, identifying sources of feedstuff contamination and methods {{to reduce the risk}} of transmission at feed mills has become paramount. As with other biological hazards, contaminated ingredients can easily lead to cross-contamination of finished feeds and contamination throughout the facility. Therefore, the objective of this study was to monitor equipment and environmental contamination after manufacturing PEDV-positive feed and after the production of subsequent PEDV-negative feed. PEDV-positive feed (50 kg with 4. 5 × 104 TCID 50 /g, Ct 11) was mixed in a 0. 11 m 3 <b>paddle</b> <b>mixer,</b> discharged into a bucket elevator, and collected. Following processing of the contaminated feed, 4 subsequent batches of PEDV-free feed (sequence 1 – 4) were processed through the mixer and bucket elevator with no decontamination between batches to mimic commercial feed production. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus contamination of equipment and surrounding areas were monitored via the collection of swabs that were analyzed via quantitative PCR (qPCR) for PEDV RNA. Swabs were collected from equipment and facility surfaces prior and after processing contaminated feed and after processing subsequent sequenced batch diets. Monitored areas for equipment included the interior of the mixer and bucket elevator. Facility areas included high and low foot traffic areas (concrete), floor drain (concrete), worker boot bottoms (rubber), table (metal), and door (metal). Three replications of contaminated feed and subsequent sequence batch diet processing was completed, with equipment and facility decontamination between replicates. Following qPCR analysis, Ct values ? 40 were considered PEDV-positive and all numerical data was converted to ± for statistical analysis via PROC MIXED procedure of SAS.

All swabs collected from equipment surfaces after processing of PEDV-positive feed were positive for PEDV, while 16 of 18 of the collected facility swabs were positive for PEDV RNA. Following processing of the first sequence batch diet, 100 % of equipment surfaces and 88. 9 % of facility surfaces were positive for PEDV. Surprisingly, a large percentage of equipment and facility surfaces remained PEDV-positive through the processing of the subsequent sequence batch diets. Furthermore, all swabs collected from concrete and rubber surfaces remained PEDV-positive through all processing of all diets. This study demonstrates the extent of equipment and facility contamination that could occur in a feed manufacturing facility after processing of PEDV-contaminated feed...|$|E
40|$|As {{a common}} unit {{operation}} in the manufacturing industry, the spray coating processes involve many fundamental physical phenomena such as the mixing and segregation of particulate systems, spray dynamics and liquid contact spreading. This thesis work focused on modeling the particulate flow dynamics by developing a multi-scale approach to predict the coating uniformity of polydisperse particles sprayed in a Forberg style paddle mixer/coater. The approach consisted of two principal models: the discrete element method (DEM) for modeling the general flow features, and the population balance (PB) for simulating the multidimensional particle property distribution. ^ First principles analysis based on DEM simulations and spray post-processing was performed to characterize the complex flow and mixing kinetics, especially through the spray region where particles receive the coating mass. The number of spray zone visits and surface area exposure percentage were found to significantly affect the coating mass distribution such that small particles receive more spray than expected. This trend was the opposite of that observed from fluidized bed or spouted bed coating systems, in which large particles were preferentially sprayed. The spatial component analysis at the mixing steady state showed the size segregation of large particles in certain regions in the bed was {{the main cause of}} the spray preference. It was also found that the mixing intensity had little impact on the mixing kinetics, but the extent of segregation could be reduced by increasing the paddle rotational speed. ^ To study the coating mass distribution, a new two dimensional PB model was developed based on a compartment model scheme which incorporated the flow heterogeneity information from the DEM study. The results showed the coating mass coefficient of variance (CoV) ideally evolved with the inverse square root of the spray time for size independence growth, and deviated from the trend for size dependence growth. Increasing the seed particle size CoV 0 or growth rate size dependence both caused an increase in the coating mass CoV beyond that predicted by one dimensional models. Sensitivity analysis on compartment model parameters showed significant influences from the bed characteristic time, bed recycle ratio and shortcut circuit fractions. Further parametric study also demonstrated an increase trend of coating mass CoV increased as Froude number Fr increased for Fr 3 ̆c 2. ^ Finally, lab scale spray coating experiments were conducted to validate the model. From the unimodal series experiments, it was observed a similar power law relation of coating mass CoV with the spray time, and an increasing trend of coating mass CoV with the Fr value to what predicted from the DEM-PB model. The results of bimodal series experiments demonstrated a preferential spraying towards the relative small particle population, again as predicted by the model. ^ The DEM-PB model is a powerful tool for design and optimization of spray coating in a Forberg style <b>paddle</b> <b>mixer.</b> The multi-scale approach taken is a template for more general application to other coaters and granulators. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the search}} for a {{renewable}} energy source that could replace petroleum and other nonrenewable energy sources, pyrolysis of biomass is a hopeful alternative and pretreatment could further improve its potential. There are several possible routes for pretreating lignocellulosic biomass, but many need further refining before becoming economical. The main obstacle for the conversion of biomass to high quality products is the presence of alkali and alkaline earth metals (AAEMs) that are known to impair cellulose decomposition to levoglucosan and promote char, water, and light oxygenate formation. One pretreatment option is to remove the AAEMs from the biomass by washing. Another efficient process of converting biomass into high quality bio-oil is a dilute acid pretreatment that passivates AAEMs in biomass, leading to decreased cellulose monomer fragmentation and thus increasing sugar yields. In this study the effectiveness of a washing method [...] involving a recycled carboxylic acid rich, aqueous fraction of bio-oil [...] is looked at for red oak. This study also presents an optimization of three important variables in the dilute acid pretreatment process of the agricultural byproduct, cornstover, to increase the value of the bio-oil produced. In the preliminary study, red oak was washed with an aqueous fraction of bio-oil to remove the AAEMs. While effective at removing AAEMs, the levoglucosan yield did not improve, unless a water rinse was incorporated [...] increasing levoglucosan yields from 3. 3 to 13. 3 wt%. Passivating the remaining AAEMs in the washed samples with sulfuric acid was less effective but increased levoglucosan yields from 3. 3 wt% to 9. 8 wt%. These processes were compared to samples that were only passivated with sulfuric acid, which led to levoglucosan yields of 20. 8 wt%. In the pretreatment optimization study for cornstover, the variables considered were the particle size upon acid infusion, the biomass to water ratio, and the diffusion time. Pretreatment of 400 g batches of cornstover was carried out in a <b>paddle</b> <b>mixer</b> equipped with a pump and sprayer. From these batches 250 μg samples were pyrolyzed to examine their effect on product yields, mainly levoglucosan. Levoglucosan yields increased more than 2, 000 %, reaching yields as high as 17 wt% on a dry biomass basis. With process optimization the amount of water necessary for acid passivation can be reduced significantly. Reducing the amount of water in the pretreatment process led to increased levoglucosan yields; a 2 : 1 biomass to water ratio was found to be more effective than a 1 : 1 ratio at increasing yields. The particle size also played an important role. 3. 17 mm particles resulted in the highest levoglucosan yields. Diffusion time was not an important factor in the acid infusion process. Overall, optimal levoglucosan yields were achieved with 3. 17 mm cornstover particles, a 2 : 1 biomass to water ratio, over any length of diffusion time...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Grain Science and IndustryCharles R StarkThe {{uniformity}} of a feed mixture is determined from {{the coefficient of}} variation (CV) of ten samples in a single batch of feed. The feed industry standard is a %CV of less than 10 using a single source tracer such as salt, trace minerals or iron filings. The {{uniformity of}} mix can be affected by many factors including ingredient properties, equipment design, mix time, sampling method, sample preparation and overall precision of method. The objectives of this thesis were to verify the chloride ion test by the Quantab® chloride titrator method and {{to determine the effect}} of extended mixing time, salt particle size, sample preparation, wet mix time, spray condition, application time of the liquid addition, percent liquid addition and mixer type on the uniformity of mix. The first experiment evaluated the effect of water temperature, technician, extraction time, dissolution time on the chloride ion test by the Quantab® chloride titrator method. The salt concentration was significantly affected by water temperature and dissolution time. The results of Experiment 1 demonstrated the 60 ºC water temperature and the 30 s extraction time by stirring followed by immediately placing the strip into the solution after extraction should be used for the Quantab® chloride titrator method. The second experiment evaluated the effect of extended mix time, particle size of salt and sample preparation on the %CV. The extended mix time did not result in segregation (P > 0. 30). However, particle size of the salt and sample preparation significantly affected the uniformity of mix. The results of Experiment 2 indicated that the extended mix time of up to 60 minutes did not increase the %CV of the feed; the particle size of the salt used in the uniformity of mix test can significantly change the results of the test; and grinding the sample prior to analysis improved the precision of the Quantab® chloride titrator method when coarse salt is used in the manufacturing process. The third experiment evaluated the effect of wet mix time and the timing of the liquid addition using different spray conditions on the %CV. The wet mix time significantly changed the %CV of the mixture (P = 0. 0057). The use of a spray nozzle had no effect on the %CV of the feed mixture when a 1. 14 % of a 23 % saline solution was sprayed on to the feed (P = 0. 7435). The results of Experiment 3 indicated the wet mix time had a greater influence on the uniformity of mix than the type of nozzle used to apply the liquid; and the shorter liquid application time allowed more time for the mechanical shear of the ribbons and paddles to break up the agglomerated wet particles and distribute them throughout the feed mixture when the total time of the liquid addition plus wet mix time was fixed. The fourth experiment evaluated the effect of different percent liquid addition, application time and mixer type with different wet mix times on the uniformity of mix. The %CV of feed mixed using a fixed wet mix time setting did not change when the percent liquid addition was increased, while the %CV of the feed mixed using a fixed total liquid mix time setting increased when increasing the percent liquid addition. The %CV of feed mixed with a ribbon mixer did not change when the liquid application time was decreased while the %CV of the feed mixed with a <b>paddle</b> <b>mixer</b> increased when decreasing the liquid application time. Differences were observed in the %CV based on the parameters of liquid cycle time, mixer type and mixer size. The results of Experiment 4 indicated the liquid addition time and the percent of liquid addition affected the uniformity of mix. The uniformity of liquid application should be tested with the highest percent liquid addition. Furthermore, application and wet mix times should be determined for each mixer type and size to establish the optimal batch cycle...|$|E
