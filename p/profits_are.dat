5|$|Of the film's net profit, {{estimated}} to amount to $30–40million (£20–25million) from the cinema release alone, roughly 20% will be split between Geoffrey Rush (as executive producer), Tom Hooper and Colin Firth, who receive their bonuses {{before the other}} stakeholders. The remaining profit is to be split equally between the producers and the equity investors. The UK Film Council invested £1million of public funds from the United Kingdom lottery into the film. In March 2011 Variety estimated that the return could be between fifteen and twenty times that. The Council's merger into the British Film Institute means that the <b>profits</b> <b>are</b> {{to be returned to}} that body.|$|E

5000|$|An {{equivalent}} perspective {{relies on}} the relationship that, for each unit sold, marginal profit (Mπ) equals marginal revenue (MR) minus marginal cost (MC). Then, if marginal revenue is greater than marginal cost at some level of output, marginal <b>profit</b> <b>is</b> positive and thus a greater quantity should be produced, and if marginal revenue is less than marginal cost, marginal <b>profit</b> <b>is</b> negative and a lesser quantity should be produced. At the output level at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost, marginal <b>profit</b> <b>is</b> zero and this quantity {{is the one that}} maximizes profit. Since total profit increases when marginal <b>profit</b> <b>is</b> positive and total profit decreases when marginal <b>profit</b> <b>is</b> negative, it must reach a maximum where marginal <b>profit</b> <b>is</b> zero—or where marginal cost equals marginal revenue—and where lower or higher output levels give lower profit levels. In calculus terms, the correct intersection of MC and MR will occur when: ...|$|R
5|$|Seed is {{gathered}} from natural forest and plantations, most collectors being {{descendants of the}} original settlers. Seed is then germinated in soil-less media and sealed from the atmosphere to prevent contamination. After testing they are picked, washed (bare-rooted), sanitised and certified then packed and sealed into insulated containers for export. They grow both indoors and out and are popular for hotels and motels worldwide. Nursery <b>profits</b> <b>are</b> returned to enhance the island ecosystem. The nursery plans to expand the business to include the curly palm and other native plants of special interest.|$|E
5|$|Virginia voters {{approved}} a government-run lottery in 1987. Before the vote, supporters of a lottery suggested {{a number of}} possible ways in which lottery profits could be designated in Virginia, such as education, transportation and Chesapeake Bay cleanup. However, the referendum made no designation of how lottery profits would be spent. Sales began September 20, 1988. In 1989, the General Assembly directed Lottery proceeds to capital construction projects. From 1990 to 1998, the proceeds went to Virginia's General Fund. Starting in 1999, a provision in Virginia's budget called for all proceeds to be assigned exclusively to education. In November 2000, Virginia {{voters approved}} the creation of the State Lottery Proceeds Fund by an 83.5-point margin. The measure, which is a permanent part of Virginia's Constitution, directs the General Assembly to use all Lottery profits for educational purposes. The Lottery does not control how its <b>profits</b> <b>are</b> spent.|$|E
5|$|Jim and Pam become engaged, and she {{ultimately}} {{returns from}} New York to Scranton, where Jim has bought his parents' {{house for the}} two of them. Having avoided jail and only been sentenced to community service, Ryan dyes his hair and starts working for a bowling alley. Michael initiates a romance with Holly until she is transferred to the Nashua, New Hampshire branch and the relationship ends. When Andy is made aware of Dwight and Angela's continued affair, both men leave her. Newly hired Vice President Charles Miner implements a rigid managerial style over the branch that causes Michael to resign in protest. Michael opens the Michael Scott Paper Company, enticing Pam and Ryan to join as salespeople, and though his business model is ultimately unsustainable, Dunder Mifflin's <b>profits</b> <b>are</b> immediately threatened. In a buyout of the Michael Scott Paper Company, the three are rehired with Pam promoted to sales and Ryan returning as a temp. During the chaos, new receptionist Erin is hired to fill the vacancy originally left by Pam. The season's finale ends with a cliffhanger ending hinting that Pam might be pregnant.|$|E

50|$|Ordinary shares entitle {{the owner}} to {{a share in}} the company's net <b>profit.</b> It <b>is</b> {{calculated}} in the following way: the net <b>profit</b> <b>is</b> divided {{by the total number of}} owned shares, producing a notional value per share, known as a dividend. An individual's share of the <b>profit</b> <b>is</b> thus the dividend multiplied by the number of shares owned.|$|R

25|$|Advocates {{of unions}} {{claim that the}} higher wages that unions demand can be paid for through company profits. However, as Milton Friedman pointed out, <b>profits</b> <b>are</b> only very rarely high enough. 80% of {{national}} income is wages, and only about 6% is profits after tax, providing very little room for higher wages, even if profits could be totally used up. Moreover, <b>profits</b> <b>are</b> invested leading {{to an increase in}} capital: which raises the value of labor, increasing wages. If profits were totally removed, this source of wage increase would be removed.|$|E

25|$|Some {{believe that}} company <b>profits</b> <b>are</b> best re-invested in the company: {{research}} and development, capital investment, expansion, etc. Proponents {{of this view}} (and thus critics of dividends per se) suggest that an eagerness to return profits to shareholders may indicate the management having run out of good ideas {{for the future of}} the company. Some studies, however, have demonstrated that companies that pay dividends have higher earnings growth, suggesting that dividend payments may be evidence of confidence in earnings growth and sufficient profitability to fund future expansion.|$|E
