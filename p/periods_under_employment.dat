40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to show the existence of <b>under</b> <b>employment</b> of labor in the agricultural sector in Thailand and Indonesia, because the <b>under</b> <b>employment</b> of labor is the cause of a low relative income in agricultural sectors. This study first confirms the high performance of economic development in Thailand and Indonesia. The non-agricultural sector in both countries has greatly contributed to the attainment of high annual compound growth rate of GDP. Although the agricultural sector greatly contributed to the growing GDP in the 1950 's and 1960 's, its contribution became smaller in the 1970 's and 1980 's. In 1990, its share of the GDP was only 14. 6 % in Thailand and 19. 5 % in Indonesia. The non-agricultural sector absorbed a large part of the labor for the period 1950 - 1990. The ability of labor absorption in the agricultural sector was great and the share of labor employment in this sector reached 61. 3 % in 1990 in Thailand and 55. 9 % in Indonesia. Low labor productivity and the large share of employment suggested the existence of <b>under</b> <b>employment</b> of labor in this sector. Secondly, the Cobb-Douglas production functions of agricultural sector in Thailand and Indonesia are estimated under the assumption of constant return to scale. The marginal productivity of labor is estimated by using the estimated production elasticity of labor. By comparing these with the average wage rate, the marginal productivity of labor in the agricultural sector was found to be far less than its average wage rate. According to the findings above, one can conclude that there existed dualistic economic structures, including the <b>under</b> <b>employment</b> of labor in the agricultural sector, under the economic development process during the period 1950 - 1990 in Thailand and Indonesia...|$|R

40|$|Much {{concerning}} the disease termed leprosy is accepted as received knowledge, without thought {{to time and}} place, but there were many differences in how leprosy sufferers were treated across regions and eras, and so diversity {{should be regarded as}} normal. This thesis will examine what was meant by the term leprosy during primarily the medieval period between the sixth and fifteenth centuries in Ireland in order to see if this equates with the disease called Hansen’s Disease in the twenty-first century. The focus will fall around the twelfth century, but as the majority of the extant documentary evidence is mainly from the early modern period, this will, out of necessity, also be discussed. There has been much written on what exactly leprosy was in the past and this thesis will not attempt to answer that question directly, instead its aim will be to contextualise the situation in medieval Ireland by examining the presence of leprosy in comparative terms in the Middle Ages. Leprosy in medieval Ireland is a much neglected area of research due to the perception that {{there is a lack of}} evidence. Although extant documentary sources may be less than elsewhere in medieval Europe, this thesis will show that there are plenty of other forms of proof available. Ciara Crawford’s unpublished thesis of 2010, which examined general illness, including leprosy in the Irish annals, is the only other research undertaken this millennium regarding leprosy in medieval Ireland, as all of the other limited research in connection with this subject was undertaken during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. This thesis employs all forms of extant evidence including, annals, documentary, hagiography, archaeology, paleopathology and place-names and using this multi-disciplinary approach provides confirmation of the presence of the disease, which was then termed leprosy, in medieval Ireland. This approach resulted in multiple methodological and terminology issues and this thesis will also attempt to address these in order to understand the extent and nature of leprosy in Ireland and its prevalence throughout the <b>period</b> <b>under</b> scrutiny. <b>Employment</b> of this multi-disciplinary approach has resulted in a surprising amount of Irish evidence concerning leprosy being gathered together for the first time. This approach enabled an image to emerge of how leprosy and its sufferers were treated and together with elsewhere, Ireland shows diverse outcomes. It must be taken into consideration however that the extant evidence is inconsistent and some geographical areas and time periods are better represented than others, resulting in an incomplete and uneven portrayal...|$|R
