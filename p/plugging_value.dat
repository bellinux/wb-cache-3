40|$|This paper proposes {{using an}} {{economical}} model {{in making the}} case for software upgrade at or-ganizations in general and at educational institutions in particular. Cost-benefit Analysis (CBA) is a model widely used in economics by various organizations to select among alternatives and to justify making certain investments. Spending money or investing in software upgrade costs may need to be justified in some cases. In these cases, {{it would be helpful to}} use a framework such as the CBA to justify and make the case for investing in software upgrade. The paper intends to help with determining the feasibility (or lack of it) of paying for software upgrade by introducing this framework. The main contribution of this paper lie in the introduction of a framework that can be used by academic institutions when tackling a decision or contemplating the purchase of software up-grades. Such a framework can then be systematically applied to justify and make the case for or against purchasing software upgrade. A secondary contribution for the paper is to suggest meth-ods for converting factors influencing software upgrades into monetary values so to be able to <b>plug</b> <b>values</b> in the proposed framework. To achieve both objectives, the paper articulates the fac-tors that stand for and against the purchase of technology upgrade. It then suggests ways convert these factors into monetary values.

LiaB is a set of ‘hands-on’ exercises in which students design, build, and test at home various d. c. and a. c. circuits using an inexpensive electronics kit, digital multimeter, and a software oscilloscope and, thus, has not require significant resources to implement. The inclusion of LiaB in our ECE curriculum has received overwhelmingly positive comments from the students as well as from faculty members who have used the kits for projects in upper division courses that have been traditionally lecture-based with no lab component and has been adopted by three community colleges. The aim of the first set of experiments that are under development, funded {{by a grant from the}} National Science Foundation, is to reinforce abstract concepts on first-order and second- order RLC circuits introduced in the companion circuits lecture course. The students construct circuits with physical components rather than symbolic parts in PSpice and determine the time-varying voltage drops and currents in the circuit by direct measurement rather than by <b>plugging</b> <b>values</b> into their calculators. Experiments enable students to explore how the component tolerances, the initial state of the capacitor and/or inductor, and the frequency response of the circuit affects the output signal.

40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIA key {{aspect of}} the design of long {{distance}} ore concentrate pipelines {{is the need to}} properly predict maximum pressures. This is traditionally done by means of transient analysis, thus predicting the possible impact of slurry hammers, which may occur during operation in a potentially uncontrolled manner in case of power outages. In this technical note, it is shown for typical ore slurry and pipeline characteristics, that in long distance systems with routes having inclined sections, the plug formation mechanism may become a dominant factor in system overpressures. A dimensionless number expressed as the ratio of the Joukowski and the <b>plug</b> overpressure <b>value,</b> suggests that a scale for the critical plug length above which maximum pressures are controlled by the plug mechanism rather than the transient flow is between about 150 m and 500 m, or a few percent points of the overall pipeline length in common long distance systems.

5000|$|The inverse demand {{function}} {{is useful in}} deriving the total and marginal revenue functions. Total revenue equals price, P, times quantity, Q, or TR = P×Q. Multiply the inverse {{demand function}} by Q to derive the total revenue function: TR = (120 - [...]5Q) × Q = 120Q - 0.5Q². The marginal revenue function is the first derivative of the total revenue function; here MR = 120 - Q. Note that the MR function has the same y-intercept as the inverse demand function in this linear example; the x-intercept of the MR function is one-half the value of that of the demand function, and {{the slope of the}} MR function is twice that of the inverse demand function. This relationship holds true for all linear demand equations. The importance of being able to quickly calculate MR is that the profit-maximizing condition for firms regardless of market structure is to produce where marginal revenue equals marginal cost (MC). To derive MC the first derivative of the total cost function is taken. For example, assume cost, C, equals 420 + 60Q + Q2. Then MC = 60 + 2Q. Equating MR to MC and solving for Q gives Q = 20. So 20 is the profit maximizing quantity: to find the profit-maximizing price simply <b>plug</b> the <b>value</b> of Q into the inverse demand equation and solve for P.|$|R

40|$|A living {{system can}} be viewed as a {{chemical}} reaction network described as a “biological circuit”, in which genes and their products are represented by nodes in the circuit (Fig 1 a). A fundamental and ubiquitous difficulty of systems biology is identifying relevant model parameters. A genetic network model of the biological clock of Neurospora crassa quantitatively consistent with available RNA and protein profiling data was proposed in [1]. Due to the oscillating nature of biological clock models, the search space of the model parameters is extremely complex. Also the high dimensionality of the search space makes exhaustive searches impractical. Population based evolutionary algorithms are suitable tools for such complex high dimensional search problems. In this work, we applied an evolution strategy, which is a robust and fast evolutionary algorithm, to solve the problem. The only way to evaluate fitness of the model parameters is to <b>plug</b> the <b>values</b> into the system and numerically solve the Ordinary differential equation (Runge-Kutta Method) to compare with the actual data from biological experiments. Thousands of equations need to be solved for each generation while we evolve the population to converge towards an optimal solution.
