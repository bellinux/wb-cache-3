5|$|Charlton {{was limited}} to 25 {{appearances}} in the 1972–73 campaign and suffered an injury in the FA Cup semi-final against Wolves which ended his season. After failing to regain his fitness for the final, he announced his retirement. Madeley played in his <b>place</b> <b>but</b> Gordon McQueen had been signed as his long-term replacement. He played his testimonial against Celtic, and was given £28,000 of the £40,000 matchday takings.|$|E

5|$|Not {{only were}} stone castles {{expensive}} {{to build in}} the first <b>place,</b> <b>but</b> their maintenance was a constant drain. They contained a lot of timber, which was often unseasoned {{and as a result}} needed careful upkeep. For example, it is documented that in the late 12thcentury repairs at castles such as Exeter and Gloucester cost between £20 and £50 annually.|$|E
5|$|A second {{reservoir}} {{was built}} around 1860 in Brown Cove, between Swirral Edge and Lower Man, {{along with one}} further down the valley in Keppel Cove. These provided water to generate hydroelectric power for the lead mine. The dam in Keppel Cove is still in <b>place,</b> <b>but</b> water now leaks through its base. The remains of the dam in Brown Cove can be seen, but again water leaks freely through it. It is unclear whether there ever was a natural tarn in Brown Cove. Guidebook writers before 1860 refer only to Keppel Cove Tarn {{to the north of}} Swirral Edge.|$|E

Newcastle finished the 2007–08 season in twelfth <b>place,</b> <b>but</b> as the season drew to a close, Keegan publicly criticised the board, claiming they were not providing the team enough financial support.|$|E

5|$|Barrichello's {{victory was}} {{considered}} popular amongst the Formula One paddock {{as it came}} after a setback during his career. The race result meant Häkkinen and Coulthard were tied for second <b>place</b> <b>but</b> the points advantage to Michael Schumacher was reduced to two points. Barrichello remained a further eight points behind the McLaren drivers. In the Constructors' Championship McLaren remained four points behind the Ferraris, who were 80 points ahead of Williams with six races of the season remaining. The track intruder, named as 47-year-old Frenchman Robert Sehli, later apologised for his actions and was fined by the track's management.|$|E
5|$|Eight {{locations}} in Juniata County are {{listed on the}} National Register of Historic Places. They were listed between 1972 and 1986. They include the Academia Pomeroy Covered Bridge, the Tuscarora Academy, and the Book Site in Beale Township; the Lehmans-Port Royal Bridge in Milford Township; and the East Oriental and North Oriental covered bridges. The Dimmsville Covered Bridge in Greenwood Township had been designated as a historic <b>place,</b> <b>but</b> fell into disrepair and collapsed in April, 2017.

5|$|Elie Wiesel {{was born}} on 30 September 1928 in Sighet, a town in the Carpathian {{mountains}} of northern Transylvania, to Chlomo Wiesel, a shopkeeper, and his wife, Sarah, née Feig. The family lived {{in a community of}} 10,000–20,000 mostly Orthodox Jews. Northern Transylvania had been annexed by Hungary in 1940, and restrictions on Jews were already in <b>place,</b> <b>but</b> the period Wiesel discusses {{at the beginning of the}} book, 1941–1943, was a relatively calm one for the Jewish population.|$|E

5|$|He {{continued}} {{to manage and}} change {{every aspect of the}} club, and took the decision to disassemble the club's scouting network to instead focus on local talent in Northumberland and Durham. His only major new signing of the 1974–75 season was Terry Cooper, a former Leeds United teammate. They adapted well to the First Division, finishing in seventh <b>place,</b> <b>but</b> would have finished fourth and qualified for Europe had Derby County not scored a last second goal against them {{on the last day of}} the season.|$|E
5|$|He {{kept his}} <b>place,</b> <b>but</b> in November, an injury {{sustained}} against Mallorca {{was diagnosed as}} a bruised kidney and fractured vertebrae, which kept him out for some weeks, during which time Zé Castro forced his way into consideration as a starter. In January 2007, Pablo marked his 100th game for the club with a rare goal to earn a draw with Racing Santander, and completed the season with 24 league games. He helped the club qualify for the 2007–08 UEFA Cup via the Intertoto Cup, and retained a regular spot in the starting eleven as Atlético finished fourth {{in the league and}} qualified for the Champions League, but mistakes in the Madrid derby in January 2008 led to both Real's goals and rekindled the fans' hostility.|$|E
5|$|He {{was sold}} to English First Division club Charlton Athletic in January 1987 for a fee of £125,000. He played at Wembley Stadium in {{the final of the}} Full Members Cup on 29 March, which ended in a 1–0 defeat to Blackburn Rovers. Charlton {{finished}} the 1986–87 season in the relegation play-off <b>place,</b> <b>but</b> retained their top-flight status after beating Leeds United 2–1 in a replay in the play-off final, following a 1–1 aggregate draw. Milne only played as a late substitute in the first leg at Selhurst Park, and ended the game with a broken jaw after being elbowed by Micky Adams. He dropped out of manager Lennie Lawrence's first team plans during the 1987–88 season, and was allowed to leave the club.|$|E
