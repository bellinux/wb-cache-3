5|$|Guitarist Chris Poland {{and drummer}} Gar Samuelson had been {{expelled}} from the band following {{the conclusion of the}} Peace Sells tour for disruptive behavior, including Poland's habit of <b>pawning</b> band equipment to pay for drugs. Samuelson was immediately replaced by his drum technician, Chuck Behler. However, a new guitarist would take longer to emerge. At first, the band hired guitarist Jay Reynolds from the band Malice, but Reynolds was not up to the task of recording, and was subsequently replaced by his guitar teacher, Jeff Young. Dave Mustaine has since stated his regret for the way he handled Reynolds's firing.|$|E
5|$|In the empire, Frederick {{faced the}} {{opposition}} of the Bavarian Wittelsbach dynasty and of his cousin Sigismund, who was duke in Tyrol, Vorarlberg, and Further Austria then. Sigismund had been {{in conflict with the}} Swiss Confederacy, too. When he had been banned by Pope Pius II in a conflict over the nomination of a bishop in Tyrol, the Swiss had annexed the formerly Habsburg territories of the Thurgau. In 1468, Sigismund clashed with the Swiss in the War of Waldshut, which he could end without significant territorial losses only by paying a large ransom, which he financed by <b>pawning</b> territories in the Sundgau and the Alsace to Charles the Bold of Burgundy in 1469. Charles did not, however, help Sigismund against the Swiss, and so Sigismund bought back the territories in 1474 and concluded a peace treaty with the Confederacy, the Ewige Richtung, although the emperor never recognized it. In the following Burgundy Wars, the Swiss and Sigismund both fought against Charles the Bold.|$|E
5|$|Homer {{makes an}} {{appointment}} {{at the clinic}} and pays for it by <b>pawning</b> their television. This only frustrates {{the rest of the}} Simpsons as he takes them to the scheduled appointment. In the waiting room, they claim the family doesn't have a problem and are silenced by Homer. Dr. Monroe encourages them to express their unhappiness with a series of exercises. The first is a drawing exercise, which he encourages them to draw out the source of their problems. Most of the Simpsons vent out their anger by drawing Homer as they see him. When Dr. Monroe observes it, he realizes that Homer is likely the source of their issues in the family. This is evident when he proves his own inattentive nature in being lost in the exercise and having the family view him as such, including being too strict as a disciplinarian. The other methods in getting the family {{to talk to each other}} in a normal matter fail. Dr. Monroe finally takes matters into his own hands and sends them all to a generator room, allowing them to deliver electric shocks to each other. The family shocks one another to the point of causing a power drain on the city. Unable to help them, Dr. Monroe gives the Simpsons double their money back. With a fresh sense of family unity, they use the money to buy a new television set.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Pawn</b> {{structure}} is commonly important in positional chess. Deficiencies in <b>pawn</b> structure can include having doubled <b>pawns</b> or isolated <b>pawns.</b> A positional advantage can {{be having a}} passed <b>pawn.</b> Exchanges of <b>pawns</b> or other pieces are often made or avoided to prevent such deficiencies or to obtain a <b>pawn</b> structure advantage. If an opponent moves a <b>pawn</b> into a position diagonally adjacent to a player's <b>pawn,</b> effectively offering an exchange of <b>pawns,</b> sometimes {{it is possible to}} avoid a disadvantageous <b>pawn</b> exchange by moving the attacked <b>pawn</b> directly forward instead of taking the offered <b>pawn.</b> However, one may also consider making exchanges of <b>pawns</b> or other pieces to open up a file for one's rooks and queen or opening up a diagonal for one's bishop and queen, even if a <b>pawn</b> deficiency is incurred.|$|R
50|$|A <b>pawn</b> which {{cannot be}} blocked or {{captured}} by enemy <b>pawns</b> in its advance to promotion is a passed <b>pawn.</b> In the diagram at right, White has a protected passed <b>pawn</b> on c5 and Black has an outside passed <b>pawn</b> on h5. Because endgames are often {{won by the}} player who can promote a <b>pawn</b> first, having a passed <b>pawn</b> in an endgame can be decisive - especially a protected passed <b>pawn</b> (a passed <b>pawn</b> that is protected by a <b>pawn).</b> In this vein, a <b>pawn</b> majority, {{a greater number of}} <b>pawns</b> belonging to one player {{on one side of the}} chessboard, is strategically important because it can often be converted into a passed <b>pawn.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Pawns</b> can {{be moved}} to any space at a right angle (but not diagonally). If {{adjacent}} to another <b>pawn,</b> the <b>pawn</b> may jump over that <b>pawn.</b> If an adjacent <b>pawn</b> has a third <b>pawn</b> or a wall {{on the other side}} of it, the player may move to either space that is immediately adjacent (left or right) to the first <b>pawn.</b> Multiple <b>pawns</b> may not be jumped. Walls may not be jumped, including when moving laterally due to a <b>pawn</b> or wall being behind a jumped <b>pawn.</b>|$|R

25|$|In June 2011, Rick Harrison's autobiography, License to Pawn: Deals, Steals, and My Life at the Gold & Silver, was {{published}} by Hyperion Books. Harrison's autobiography details his childhood, some of the troubles he faced before {{he got into the}} <b>pawning</b> business, as well as anecdotes from his time at the Gold & Silver. Also, The Old Man, Corey, and Chumlee have their own chapters in the book, reflecting on their life and experiences at the pawn shop.|$|E
50|$|In the endgame, {{isolated}} <b>pawns</b> are {{a weakness}} in <b>pawn</b> structure because they cannot be defended by other <b>pawns</b> as with connected <b>pawns.</b> In this diagram, the white <b>pawn</b> on the e4-square {{and the black}} <b>pawn</b> on a7 are isolated.|$|R
50|$|A passed <b>pawn</b> that is {{protected}} by its own <b>pawns</b> is called a protected passed <b>pawn.</b> In the first diagram in this article, the <b>pawns</b> on the b and e files are protected passed <b>pawns.</b> Two or more passed <b>pawns</b> on adjacent files are called connected passed <b>pawns</b> (see connected <b>pawns),</b> {{and they are very}} strong. In the diagram at the top, White's b and c <b>pawns</b> are connected passed <b>pawns.</b> A pair of connected passed <b>pawns</b> is sometimes called a steamroller. It is often strategically advantageous for the side with connected passed <b>pawns</b> to place them on the same rank and then advance them in tandem, because this makes them more difficult to blockade.|$|R
25|$|A <b>pawn</b> is {{referred}} to by the file on which it stands: a rook <b>pawn</b> is on the a- or h-file, a knight <b>pawn</b> is on the b- or g-file, a bishop <b>pawn</b> is on the c- or f-file. A central <b>pawn</b> is a queen <b>pawn</b> or a king <b>pawn,</b> on the d- or e-file.|$|R
25|$|The {{following}} spring, Sverre {{sent the}} still loyal Tore, bishop of Hamar, to Rome to plead his {{case before the}} pope. He returned in early 1197, according to the saga, carrying a papal letter which annulled the excommunication of Sverre. In Denmark, Tore {{is said to have}} fallen ill and died under suspicious circumstances, but not before <b>pawning</b> the papal letter. The pawnbrokers then travelled to Norway and delivered it to Sverre who used it for everything it was worth. No other sources confirm this story and most historians now agree that the letter was forged.|$|E
25|$|After five days, {{during which}} he used almost all his money, Riis found work as a {{carpenter}} at Brady's Bend Iron Works on the Allegheny River above Pittsburgh. After {{a few days of}} that he began mining for increased pay, but quickly resumed carpentry. Learning on July 19, 1870, that France had declared war on Germany, he expected that Denmark would join France to avenge the Prussian seizure of Schleswig, and determined to fight for France. He returned to New York, and, having pawned most of his possessions and without money, attempted to enlist at the French consulate, but was told that there was no plan to send a volunteer army from America. <b>Pawning</b> his revolver, he walked out of New York until he collapsed from exhaustion; on waking, he walked to Fordham College where a Catholic priest served him breakfast.|$|E
25|$|The {{series was}} {{originally}} pitched to HBO, though the network preferred the series {{to have been}} a Taxicab Confessions-style series taking place at the Gold & Silver's night window. The format eventually evolved into the now-familiar family-oriented motif used on the series. History president Nancy Dubuc, who had been charged with creating programming with a more populist appeal to balance out the network's in-depth military programming, picked up the series, which was initially titled <b>Pawning</b> History, before a staffer at Leftfield suggested that Pawn Stars would fit better with the locale. The network concurred, believing that name to be more pleasing and easily remembered. The staffer adjusted its story-line in order to bring it in line with the network's brand, which included the on-camera experts appraising the items brought into the Gold & Silver, though she did not discourage the interpersonal conflicts among the show's stars.|$|E
50|$|In chess, doubled <b>pawns</b> are two <b>pawns</b> of {{the same}} color {{residing}} on the same file. <b>Pawns</b> can become doubled only when one <b>pawn</b> captures onto a file on which another friendly <b>pawn</b> resides. In the diagram, the <b>pawns</b> on the b-file and e-file are doubled. The <b>pawns</b> on the e-file are doubled and isolated.|$|R

25|$|Mozart became {{acquainted with}} members of the famous {{orchestra}} in Mannheim, the best in Europe at the time. He also fell in love with Aloysia Weber, one of four daughters of a musical family. There were prospects of employment in Mannheim, but they came to nothing, and Mozart left for Paris on 14 March 1778 to continue his search. One of his letters from Paris hints at a possible post as an organist at Versailles, but Mozart was not interested in such an appointment. He fell into debt and took to <b>pawning</b> valuables. The nadir of the visit occurred when Mozart's mother was taken ill and died on 3 July 1778. There had been delays in calling a doctor—probably, according to Halliwell, {{because of a lack of}} funds. Mozart stayed with Melchior Grimm, who, as personal secretary of the Duke d'Orléans, lived in his mansion.|$|E
25|$|Early {{forms of}} proto-capitalism and free markets {{were present in}} the Caliphate. An early market economy and early form of {{merchant}} capitalism developed between the 8th and 12th centuries. A vigorous monetary economy developed based on the wide circulation of a common currency (the dinar) and the integration of previously independent monetary areas. Business techniques and forms of business organization employed during this time included early contracts, bills of exchange, long-distance international trade, early forms of partnership (mufawada) such as limited partnerships (mudaraba), and early forms of credit, debt, profit, loss, capital (al-mal), capital accumulation (nama al-mal), circulating capital, capital expenditure, revenue, cheques, promissory notes, trusts (waqf), savings accounts, transactional accounts, <b>pawning,</b> loaning, exchange rates, bankers, money changers, ledgers, deposits, assignments, the double-entry bookkeeping system, and lawsuits. Organizational enterprises similar to corporations independent from the state also existed in the medieval Islamic world. Many of these concepts were adopted and further advanced in medieval Europe from the 13th century onwards.|$|E
25|$|Charles {{continued}} {{to believe that}} he could reclaim the kingdom and recalled that early in 1744 a few Scottish Highland clan chieftains had sent a message that they would rise if he arrived with as few as 3,000 French troops. Living at French expense, he {{continued to}} petition ministers for commitment to another invasion, to their increasing irritation. In secrecy he also developed a plan with a consortium of Nantes privateers, funded by exiled Scots bankers and <b>pawning</b> of his mother's jewelry. They fitted out the 16-gun privateer Du Teillay and a ship of the line the Elisabeth and set out from Nantes for Scotland in July 1745 on the pretence that this was a normal privateering cruise, leaving a personal letter from Charles to Louis XV of France announcing the departure and asking for help with the rising. The Elisabeth, carrying weapons, supplies and 700 volunteers from the Irish Brigade, encountered the British Navy ship HMS Lion and with both ships badly damaged in the ensuing battle the Elisabeth was forced back, but the Du Teillay successfully landed Charles with his seven men of Moidart on the island of Eriskay in the Outer Hebrides on 2 August 1745.|$|E

500|$|Eberhardt and Ehnni {{relocated}} to Ténès in July 1902 after Ehnni obtained employment {{there as a}} translator. Eberhardt was incorrigibly bad with her money, spending anything she received immediately on tobacco, books, and gifts for friends, and <b>pawning</b> her meagre possessions or asking for loans when she realised {{there was no money}} left for food. This behaviour made her even more of a pariah among the other European residents of the town. Eberhardt would frequently leave for weeks at a time, being either summoned to Algiers by Barrucand or sent on assignments. She was given a regular column in his newspaper, where she wrote about the life and customs of Bedouin tribes. Both Ehnni and Eberhardt's health deteriorated, with Eberhardt regularly suffering from bouts of malaria. She was also probably affected by syphillis.|$|E
