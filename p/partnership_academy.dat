This grant is used to keep class sizes small, infuse curriculum with technology, provide extra support to students, and support hands on learning. Teachers in the Academy have time to meet and collaborate. This gives them the opportunity to plan cross-curricular technology rich projects to enhance learning. It also gives teachers an opportunity to identify students who need an extra push to take themselves to the next level and pool our resources to push them. The Academy provides a rigorous academic experience that focuses on helping students complete the A-G requirements to transfer to a four university. Students take four classes per year within the Academy: English, Science, Social Studies, and a Technology elective. The elective varies each year depending on the student’s pathway. Students have the opportunity to enroll in an SAT preparation course at no cost. Students can earn college credit through Cañada College for all technology classes in the Academy.|$|E

40|$|Institutions {{of higher}} {{education}} in Milwaukee that prepare teachers all have longstanding relationships with the Milwaukee Public Schools. They work directly with principals and cooperating teachers, they provide preparation for cooperating teachers to participate in the assessment of candidates, they have strong relationships with specific schools where teacher candidates are placed both for early field experiences and student teaching. What these relationships have not done before, however, is to function as part of a coordinated system of reform. As a P- 16 Council, the Milwaukee <b>Partnership</b> <b>Academy</b> (MPA) has provided the locus for system-to-system reform, allowing the local IHEs to marshal resources together to better serve the children and youth of Milwaukee (Pugach, Post, Anderson, Lehmann, & Donder, in press). As partners in system-to-system reform, we have staked out a direction and made serious progress toward our joint goal of collaborative assessment of teacher candidates. However, we do not claim to offer absolute answers. This is a work in progress. The Milwaukee Partnership as the Context for Collaborative Assessment The MPA is an urban P- 16 council made up of three inter-related groups that form its governing structure: (1) the Executive Partners, (2) the Partners, which include broad wide community constituencies, and (3) the Implementation Team, which is the action arm of the MPA.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the culture that has developed in a school-within-a-school career academy. Using a case study approach, the study focused on the attitudes, beliefs, and stories of the members of one career academy. The Waverly High Health Occupations Academy was implemented in 1994 with funding from the local district and an Illinois <b>Partnership</b> <b>Academy</b> Initiative grant. The large urban high school, located in the Chicago suburban region, is ethnically and economically diverse. Data were collected through six focus groups with academy students and one focus group with academy teachers over a period of six months. The constant comparative methodology of data analysis was employed, with identifying categories assigned to describe sets of similar comments and stories. Emergent themes served as the basis for the findings. The culture of the academy was described in terms of its expectations for its members, the ways in which connectedness was fostered, and the impact of the academy on both students' and teachers' lives. Findings revealed that: (1) academy members held high expectations of themselves and others, helped each other be successful in the academy, and felt a strong sense of caring about and for each other; (2) teachers were credited with facilitating initial connections, academy members became like family, and they shared a strong sense of support with each other, and (3) students gained valuable knowledge and insights into their futures and possible careers, and they learned much about themselves, their interests, and their abilities. The theme of "family" emerged frequently in all focus groups. As the small learning community model has been and continues to be a common feature of many high school reform initiatives, the study's findings offer implications for creating a culture that supports such teaching and learning communities. Future research may indicate whether the culture of the Waverly High Health Occupations Academy is one that is shared by other career academies and school-within-a-school models...|$|E
