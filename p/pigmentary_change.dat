40|$|Background: <b>Pigmentary</b> skin <b>changes</b> {{are common}} {{presentation}} among pregnant women. The impact {{of which is}} very worrisome. Most of these <b>pigmentary</b> <b>changes</b> were due to increase hormonal influence such as melanocyte stimulating hormone, adrenocorticotrophic hormone, cortisol, progesterone and increased sensitivity of melanocyte at normally pigmented areas. Objective: The study was aimed at documenting the prevalence and pattern of <b>pigmentary</b> <b>changes</b> {{as well as providing}} baseline data among pregnant women in Nigeria. Materials and Methods: This study was a descriptive cross-sectional study of 240 primigravidae who attended antenatal clinic of Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals’ Complex (OAUTHC), Ile-Ife, Nigeria and 240 controls who were never pregnant. The study was carried out between March, 2013 and March, 2014. Data was analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 16. 0. Data were presented in tables and statistical significance (measured as P< 0. 05) were determined using Chi square and Friedman’s tests as appropriate. Results: The general prevalence of <b>pigmentary</b> <b>changes</b> in pregnancy among the subjects in this study was 77. 5 % in first trimester, 95. 8 % in second and 95. 4 % in third trimesters while it was 17. 1 % in the controls. Nipple, areola, generalized hyperpimentations and linea nigra were much higher than controls. These <b>pigmentary</b> <b>changes</b> also increased in prevalence as pregnancy advanced. There was statistically significant association between gestational age (trimester) and <b>pigmentary</b> <b>changes</b> (P= 0. 000). The prevalence of melasma increases as the pregnancy progresses from 5. 0 % in first trimester to 8. 8 % in third trimester. The relationship was found to be statistically significant (P= 0. 000). Conclusion: The prevalence of <b>pigmentary</b> <b>changes</b> among pregnant women in Nigeria was found to be very high. Healthcare workers involved in obstetric care need to be well informed to enable accurate diagnosis and education of patients.

This review discusses the hereditary group of the reticulated pigmentation disorders, such as dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria, dyschromatosis universalis hereditaria, and reticulate acropigmentation of Kitamura. The clinical presentation and histopathological features often overlap, making diagnosis difficult. However, each of these hereditary conditions possesses a unique genetic mutation, and genetic analysis is thus more useful in the diagnosis of these conditions. This article delivers an update regarding the clinical features, detailed histopathological description, and genetic information concerning hereditary reticulate pigmentary disorders and aims to provide useful background for use by clinical dermatologists and histopathologists when approaching this group of hereditary disorders...|$|E
40|$|Human melanocytes are {{not simply}} pigment-producing cells. It {{may be part of}} the {{inflammatory}} response, during which the pigmentary system may produce more melanin or suppress melanization. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have been implicated in both innate host defense against pathogens and inflammatory response. Therefore, it may be possible that activation of TLRs in melanocytes {{may play a role in}} the modulation of melanogenesis. In this study, we investigated whether normal human melanocytes expressed TLRs and analyzed pigmentation changes upon TLR stimulation. The expression of TLR 1 ~ 10 mRNA in cultured human melanocyte was analyzed using RT-PCR, Western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Human melanocytes constitutively express mRNA and protein for TLR 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9 and 10. Stimulation of TLR 1 / 2 and 4 with Pam 3 CSK 4 and lipopolysaccharide induced pigmentation of melanocytes. Activation of TLR 5 and 7 with flagellin and imiquimod treatments reduced pigmentation of melanocytes and zebrafish. In summary, the results provided evidence for TLRs expression in normal human melanocytes. It is speculated that a response of melanocyte to TLR ligands may play a role in the <b>pigmentary</b> <b>change</b> in the skin...|$|E

In group 1, 12 patients were treated with lid hygiene, warm compresses, and chloramphenicol 1 % ointment 4 times a day. In group 2, 16 patients were treated with 0. 3 mL triamcinolone acetonide (10 mg/mL) injection to the subcutaneous tissue extralesionally via the percutaneous route. Exclusion criteria were: acutely infected chalazion with preseptal cellulitis, recurrent chalazion, small chalazion (≤ 2 mm), and prior treatment to chalazion. Main outcome measures. Size of chalazion, recurrence of chalazion, intraocular pressure, and complications from treatment, including skin <b>pigmentary</b> <b>change</b> or atrophy and pyogenic granuloma. Results. There was a clinically and statistically {{significant difference between the}} success rates in group 1 (58. 3 %) and group 2 (93. 8 %).

30|$|Clinical changes {{recognizable}} as photoaging include wrinkle, inelasticity, telangiectasia and <b>pigmentary</b> <b>change.</b> Although not detrimental in nature, hyperpigmentation {{can be a}} big cosmetic concern, especially among Asian. The inhibition of melanogenesis is a critical target for skin-whitening cosmetic and treatment of abnormal pigmentation (Yokozawa and Kim [2007]). Since tyrosinase is a rate-limiting enzyme of melanogenesis, inhibition on its action is one major strategy to treat hyperpigmentation. The anti-tyrosinase and anti-melanogenic activity of natural substances have been studied extensively. Fruit extracts of bitter melon have been shown to exert significant inhibitory effect on mushroom tyrosinase (Kamkaen et al. [2007]; Masuda et al. [2007]; Baurin et al. [2002]). Kamkaen et al. ([2007]) reported that methanolic extract of bitter melon fruit can exert a significant mushroom tyrosinase inhibition (78.9 % compared to positive control of kojic acid). Masuda et al. ([2007]) reported that ethanol extract of bitter melon fruit can show 21.7 % of mushroom tyrosinase inhibitory activity at a concentration of 0.5  mg/mL. Similar finding was reported in previous study that used propylene glycol/deionized water extract of bitter melon plants with 32 % inhibition of mushroom tyrosinase (Baurin et al. [2002]). In our preliminary study, WBM leaf extracts exhibited suppressive effect on mushroom tyrosinase activity at a concentration of 5  mg/mL. It is not yet known whether WBM leaf extract has anti-melanogenic activity in cellular assay. In the experiments reported here, HL- 1 showed more potent anti-tyrosinase and anti-melanogenic activities than others. Regarding the inhibitory effect on tyrosinase activity, HL- 1 extract was similar to kojic acid at each tested concentration (Figure  4). Kojic acid shows its anti-tyrosinase activity by chelating the copper ion in the active site of tyrosinase (Kahn [1995]). However, the inhibitory mechanism or effective constituents of WBM leaf extract is still unclear. Kim et al. ([2008]), Yokozawa and Kim ([2007]), and Kim ([2007]) reported that the antimelanogenic action of some agents is related to their antioxidant activity. Concerning the action mechanism of anti-tyrosinase agents, blocking of oxidative pathway (Kim [2007]) and binding of enzyme activity sites (Curto et al. [1999]) may be involved in inhibiting the catalytic reaction of tyrosinase. Previous studies demonstrated that gallate and its derivatives (Kim [2007]; Tanford [1980]) and p-alkoxybenzoic acid derivatives (Chen et al. [2005]) can act as tyrosinase inhibitors. The bulky hydrophobic portions of gallate derivatives were considered to interact with tyrosinase’s hydrophobic protein bulk surrounding the binuclear copper active site and thus gallate derivatives exerted the anti-tyrosinase effect (Tanford [1980]). Since gallic acid was found in WBM leaf extracts, it speculated that gallic acid may contribute, at least partially, to anti-melanogenic activity of WBM leaf extracts. Other unknown active constituents present in WBM leaf extract could also play critical roles in the biological effects. The identification of these functional or bioactive ingredients in WBM leaf extract is an interesting topic for future study.|$|E
