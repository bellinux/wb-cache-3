He {{had the opportunity to}} attend the University of Cambridge, but decided, after his first term, to complete the full course of his undergraduate studies at Edinburgh. The academic staff of Edinburgh University included some highly regarded names; his first year tutors included Sir William Hamilton, who lectured him on logic and metaphysics, Philip Kelland on mathematics, and James Forbes on natural philosophy. He did not find his classes at Edinburgh University very demanding, and was therefore able to immerse himself in private study during free time at the university and particularly when back home at Glenlair. There he would experiment with improvised chemical, electric, and magnetic apparatus, but his chief concerns regarded the properties of polarised light. He constructed shaped blocks of gelatine, subjected them to various stresses, and with a pair of polarising prisms given to him by William Nicol, viewed the coloured fringes that had developed within the jelly. Through this practice he discovered <b>photoelasticity,</b> which is a means of determining the stress distribution within physical structures.|$|E

Well known manifestations of this effect appear in optical wave plates/retarders (linear modes) and in Faraday rotation/optical rotation (circular modes). If the path length in the birefringent medium is sufficient, plane waves will exit the material with a significantly different propagation direction, due to refraction. For example, {{this is the}} case with macroscopic crystals of calcite, which present the viewer with two offset, orthogonally polarised images of whatever is viewed through them. It was this effect that provided the first discovery of polarization, by Erasmus Bartholinus in 1669. In addition, the phase shift, and thus the change in polarization state, is usually frequency dependent, which, in combination with dichroism, often gives rise to bright colours and rainbow-like effects. In mineralogy, such properties, known as pleochroism, are frequently exploited for the purpose of identifying minerals using polarization microscopes. Additionally, many plastics that are not normally birefringent will become so when subject to mechanical stress, a phenomenon which is the basis of <b>photoelasticity.</b> Non-birefringent methods, to rotate the linear polarization of light beams, include the use of prismatic polarization rotators which use total internal reflection in a prism set designed for efficient collinear transmission.|$|E
2500|$|Isotropic solids do not exhibit birefringence. However, {{when they}} are under {{mechanical}} stress, birefringence results. The stress can be applied externally or is [...] "frozen in" [...] after a birefringent plastic ware is cooled after it is manufactured using injection molding. When such a sample is placed between two crossed polarizers, colour patterns can be observed, because polarization of a light ray is rotated after passing through a birefringent material {{and the amount of}} rotation is dependent on wavelength. The experimental method called <b>photoelasticity</b> used for analyzing stress distribution in solids is based on the same principle.|$|E

50|$|<b>Photoelasticity</b> can {{describe}} both three-dimensional and two-dimensional states of stress. However, examining <b>photoelasticity</b> in three-dimensional systems is more involved than two-dimensional or plane-stress system. So the present section deals with <b>photoelasticity</b> {{in a plane}} stress system. This condition is achieved when {{the thickness of the}} prototype is much smaller as compared to dimensions in the plane. Thus one is only concerned with stresses acting parallel to the plane of the model, as other stress components are zero. The experimental setup varies from experiment to experiment. The two basic kinds of setup used are plane polariscope and circular polariscope.|$|E

Between 1930 and 1940, many other books appeared on the subject, including books in Russian, German and French. At the same time, much development occurred in the field - great improvements were achieved in technique, and the equipment was simplified. With refinements in the technology, photoelastic experiments were extended to determining three-dimensional states of stress.

It is a property of all dielectric media and {{is often used to}} experimentally determine the stress distribution in a material, where it gives a picture of stress distributions around discontinuities in materials. Photoelastic experiments are an important tool for determining critical stress points in a material, and are used for determining stress concentration in irregular geometries.|$|E
50|$|Many {{crystals}} {{are naturally}} birefringent, but isotropic {{materials such as}} plastics and glass can also often be made birefringent by introducing a preferred direction through, e.g., an external force or electric field. This can be utilized in the determination of stresses in structures using <b>photoelasticity.</b> The birefringent material is then placed between crossed polarizers. A change in birefringence will alter the polarization and thereby the fraction of light that is transmitted through the second polarizer.|$|E
