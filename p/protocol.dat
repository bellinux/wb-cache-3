5|$|All {{programs}} that wish to provide services-as-files to other programs speak a unified <b>protocol,</b> called 9P. Compared to other systems, this reduces {{the number of}} custom programming interfaces. 9P is a generic, medium-agnostic, byte-oriented <b>protocol</b> that provides for messages delivered between a server and a client. The <b>protocol</b> is {{used to refer to}} and communicate with processes, programs, and data, including both the user interface and the network. With the release of the 4th edition, it was modified and renamed 9P2000.|$|E

Numerical results and comparisons of three cooperative MAC <b>protocols</b> with reactive helper node selection mechanisms are presented. Research trends, {{as well as the}} advantages and disadvantages of related research, on cross-layer cooperative MAC <b>protocols,</b> cooperative routing, and transport <b>protocols</b> are described...|$|R
30|$|Although {{the single}} channel based <b>protocols</b> have much simpler {{architectures}} than the multi-channel based <b>protocols,</b> the data transmission {{rate of the}} source-destination pair is {{lower than that of}} the latter kind of <b>protocols.</b> However, multi-channels based <b>protocols</b> usually need to design more complex mechanisms to guarantee the fairness of <b>protocols</b> and efficiently allocate spectrum and transmit power. Moreover, the multi-channel based <b>protocols</b> often have higher cost than the single-channel based <b>protocols</b> because more radios are needed.|$|R
30|$|Second, we {{will show}} some {{classical}} routing <b>protocols.</b> In general, the routing <b>protocols</b> are classified into two types for WSNs: flat routing <b>protocols</b> and hierarchical routing <b>protocols.</b> In flat routing <b>protocols,</b> they route data to the sink node through a multi-hop network. In hierarchical routing <b>protocols,</b> sensor nodes construct clusters for routing, and then data transmission occurs as two steps, i.e., intra-cluster routing and inter-cluster routing [10].|$|R
5|$|For the Internet, the {{physical}} medium and data link <b>protocol</b> can vary several times as packets traverse the globe. This {{is because the}} Internet places no constraints on what physical medium or data link <b>protocol</b> is used. This leads {{to the adoption of}} media and protocols that best suit the local network situation. In practice, most intercontinental communication will use the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) <b>protocol</b> (or a modern equivalent) on top of optic fiber. This is because for most intercontinental communication the Internet shares the same infrastructure as the public switched telephone network.|$|E

40|$|<b>Protocols</b> are modular abstractions {{that capture}} {{patterns}} of interaction among agents. The compelling vision behind <b>protocols</b> is to enable creating customized interactions by refining and composing existing <b>protocols.</b> Realizing this vision presupposes (1) maintaining repositories of <b>protocols</b> and (2) refining and composing selected <b>protocols.</b> To this end, this paper synthesizes recent advances on <b>protocols</b> {{and on the}} knowledge representation of actions. This paper presents MAD-P, a modular action description language tailored for <b>protocols.</b> MAD-P enables building an aggregation hierarchy of <b>protocols</b> via composition.

40|$|Underwater {{wireless}} sensor networks (UWSNs) {{are similar}} to the terrestrial sensor networks. Nevertheless, there are different characteristics among them such as low battery power, limited bandwidth and high variable propagation delay. One of the common major problems in UWSNs is determining an efficient and reliable routing between the source node and the destination node. Therefore, researchers tend to design efficient <b>protocols</b> with consideration of the different characteristics of underwater communication. Furthermore, many routing <b>protocols</b> have been proposed and these <b>protocols</b> may be classified as location-based and location-free routing <b>protocols.</b> Pressure-based routing <b>protocols</b> are a subcategory of the location-free routing <b>protocols.</b> This paper focuses on reviewing the pressure-based routing <b>protocols</b> that may further be classified into non-void avoidance <b>protocols</b> and void avoidance <b>protocols.</b> Moreover, non-void avoidance <b>protocols</b> have been classified into single factor based and multi factor based routing <b>protocols.</b> Finally, this paper provides a comparison between these <b>protocols</b> based on their features, performance and simulation parameters and the paper concludes with some future works on which further study can be conducted...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} different <b>protocols</b> to induce regular changes in RR-intervals and {{systolic blood pressure}} by considering the success of inducing changes, the variability in following the <b>protocols</b> and the variability of the changes. Twelve subjects had their ECG and continuous noninvasive blood pressure (Finapres) recorded while following four breathing, and four action <b>protocols.</b> All the <b>protocols</b> were designed to induce changes in heart rate and blood pressure at 8 times a minute (0. 133 Hz). Induction success was 92 % for the breathing <b>protocols</b> and 47 % for the action <b>protocols.</b> Both sets of <b>protocols</b> were performed equally well. With RR-interval changes, variability was 3. 1 times lower for breathing <b>protocols</b> than action <b>protocols,</b> and for SP level changes it was 3. 4 times lower.

In [12], the four-way handshaking of the IEEE 802.11 medium access is considered {{as the main}} criterion to categorize the surveyed MAC <b>protocols.</b> In [13], the authors classify the MAC <b>protocols</b> based on the access scheme which defines two major MAC categories: random access <b>protocols</b> and scheduled <b>protocols.</b> The first category represents an adequate solution for ad hoc networks {{and most of the}} works have been done using this scheme. These works are further classified into three groups: pure-RTS/CTS <b>protocols,</b> tone-based <b>protocols,</b> and other <b>protocols</b> using additional control packets.|$|R
40|$|Synchronization {{algorithms}} {{that are}} efficient {{across a wide}} range of applications and operating conditions are hard to design because their performance depends on unpredictable run-time factors.
