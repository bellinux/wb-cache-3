5|$|<b>Progress</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> {{towards the}} team's new arena on March 22, when the former St. Francis Hospital, {{across the street}} from Mellon Arena, was imploded. Following debris removal and site preparation, {{groundbreaking}} for construction began in the summer.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill was}} {{deposited}} in Parliament, but no <b>progress</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> in the 1898 session and it disappeared afterwards, although the BS presented {{a modified version}} of the Euston branch in a bill for the 1899 session.|$|E
5|$|Little <b>progress</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> {{over the}} next century in {{explaining}} or treating tics, and a psychogenic view prevailed well into the 20th century. The possibility that movement disorders, including Tourette syndrome, might have an organic origin was raised when an encephalitis epidemic from 1918–1926 led to a subsequent epidemic of tic disorders.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there were}} {{periodic}} attempts at reconciliation between the Metropolia and the Russian Church {{over the next}} few decades, no serious <b>progress</b> <b>was</b> <b>made.</b> During this time, the ethnic character of the Metropolia began to change. Since many Russian immigrants to America aligned themselves with the vocally anti-Communist ROCOR, the Metropolia experienced its growth increasingly through the addition of English-speaking converts. As a result, the ethnic makeup of the Metropolia began to shift away from a purely Slavic one that had included mainly Russians, Ukrainians, Galicians, and Rusyns.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they had}} {{initially}} {{been told that}} they would be withdrawn from the front within 48 hours, the strategic situation called that they remained at the front holding the ground on the eastern flank. In late July a breakout from the beachhead was attempted and the 1st Special Service Brigade moved through the Le Bois de Bavent, a large wooded area, as the Germans began to withdraw. Nevertheless, little <b>progress</b> <b>was</b> <b>made,</b> and, after a brief move which saw No. 6 Commando advance to Bavent, they went on the defensive again.|$|E
5|$|The {{attack on}} Orsonga began at 3:30pm, {{following}} a half-hour artillery bombardment, and marked the battalion's first battle on Italian soil. Although initially some <b>progress</b> <b>was</b> <b>made,</b> the Germans {{managed to hold}} Orsonga throughout December amidst intense hand-to-hand fighting. Finally, the Māoris were withdrawn from the line {{on the night of}} 15/16 January 1944 when they were relieved by an Indian unit. Over the course of the battle, they had lost 11 men killed and 222 wounded.|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} {{had been planned}} since 1968 as a vision of Yogiji Maharaj. Yogiji Maharaj, the spiritual head of the BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha at the time, expressed his desire for wanting a grand temple built {{on the banks of}} the Yamuna river to two or three devotee families of Swaminarayan that resided in New Delhi at the time. Attempts were made to start the project, however little <b>progress</b> <b>was</b> <b>made.</b> In 1971, Yogiji Maharaj died.|$|E
5|$|The field {{grew from}} 19th century beginnings, where {{embryology}} faced a mystery: zoologists {{did not know}} how embryonic development was controlled at the molecular level. Charles Darwin noted that having similar embryos implied common ancestry, but little <b>progress</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> until the 1970s. Then, recombinant DNA technology at last brought embryology together with molecular genetics. A key early discovery was of homeotic genes that regulate development {{in a wide range of}} eukaryotes.|$|E
5|$|The second {{significant}} HV offensive was Operation Whirlwind, launched {{across the}} Kupa River on 11 December. The HV was tasked with advancing towards Glina but the operation failed after a shallow bridgehead was established within two days. In Lika, battles were fought for individual villages but little <b>progress</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> by either side. The JNA captured four villages south of Osijek between 21 November and 16 December but {{the front lines}} generally became static.|$|E
50|$|All <b>progress</b> <b>is</b> <b>made</b> at {{low speed}} and the {{emphasis}} is on skill, rather than finishing first although trialing can be highly competitive. There are three traditional forms of off-road trailing.|$|R
50|$|There {{are some}} less {{difficult}} versions, which reduce the effort by supporting {{some of the}} body weight in some way. One can {{move on to the}} standard push-up after <b>progress</b> <b>is</b> <b>made.</b>|$|R
50|$|There is {{explicitly}} in Seers a sequently aspect to this. As <b>progress</b> <b>is</b> <b>made</b> towards the economic goals, that is ‘undernourishment, unemployment and inequality dwindle’.. ‘educational and political aims {{become increasingly important}} objectives of development’.|$|R
5|$|As at Oak Ridge, {{the most}} {{difficulty}} was encountered while canning the uranium slugs, which commenced at Hanford in March 1944. They were pickled to remove dirt and impurities, dipped in molten bronze, tin, and aluminum-silicon alloy, canned using hydraulic presses, and then capped using arc welding under an argon atmosphere. Finally, they {{were subjected to}} a series of tests to detect holes or faulty welds. Disappointingly, most canned slugs initially failed the tests, resulting in an output {{of only a handful of}} canned slugs per day. But steady <b>progress</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> and by June 1944 production increased to the point where it appeared that enough canned slugs would be available to start Reactor B on schedule in August 1944.|$|E
5|$|Benedict Arnold next wrote {{a series}} of letters to Clinton, even before he might have {{expected}} {{a response to the}} July 7 letter. In a July 11 letter, he complained that the British did not appear to trust him, and threatened to break off negotiations unless <b>progress</b> <b>was</b> <b>made.</b> On July 12, he wrote again, making explicit the offer to surrender West Point, although his price rose to £20,000 (in addition to indemnification for his losses), with a £1,000 down payment to be delivered with the response. These letters were delivered by Samuel Wallis, another Philadelphia businessman who spied for the British, rather than by Stansbury.|$|E
5|$|Despite the World War I, {{significant}} {{extensions of}} rail lines were carried out, {{particularly in the}} wheat growing areas in the north west and west. The new lengthy parallel lines {{were considered to be}} cheaper to operate than the numerous short spurs such as those in the Goulburn Valley. By 1930 the railway map of Victoria was largely complete, with the best land settled and the remaining land marginal for agriculture, with a number of lines built across the state border into the Riverina of NSW. On November 1937 the first run of the Spirit of <b>Progress</b> <b>was</b> <b>made,</b> a streamlined all air conditioned train run between Melbourne and Albury, led by the matching S class steam locomotives.|$|E
5000|$|The only field within {{medicine}} {{where some}} <b>progress</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>was</b> pharmacology, with the compilement of the [...] "Tibb-e Shifa’i" [...] in 1556.

5|$|Early {{the next}} day the NZMRB moved towards Katia, with the {{intention}} of attacking a Turkish gun emplacement. The brigade positioned itself between the 2nd Light Horse Brigade on the left and the 3rd Light Horse Brigade on the right. Taking the lead, the regiment advanced close enough by 14:30 to charge the position on horseback, then dismounted and continued the attack on foot, all in the face of heavy rifle and machine-gun fire. No <b>progress</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> and they {{spent the rest of the}} day returning fire from cover. The engagement cost the regiment one dead and six wounded.|$|E
5|$|However, no <b>progress</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> {{with the}} {{airfield}} {{for over a}} decade. Instead, the water aerodrome at Bukta was upgraded. Initially the passengers were transported to the aircraft with a boat, {{but after a few}} years a floating dock was built. Services were only provided during five summer months, from May through September. During the rest of the year, Alta had no airline service; travel time to Oslo was then six days, largely by ship. The route was taken over by Widerøe in 1954, who bought a de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter to serve a route from Tromsø via Alta to Hammerfest, Kirkenes and Vadsø. In Tromsø, the routes connected with a Norwegian Air Lines' seaplane service to Oslo. Bukta had 2,000 annual passengers in 1957, and the summer route was flown daily beginning in 1960.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 20th century much <b>progress</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> in {{increasing}} the accuracy of measurements of the speed of light, first by cavity resonance techniques and later by laser interferometer techniques. These were aided by new, more precise, definitions of the metre and second. In 1950, Louis Essen determined the speed as , using cavity resonance. This value was adopted by the 12th General Assembly of the Radio-Scientific Union in 1957. In 1960, the metre was redefined in terms of the wavelength of a particular spectral line of krypton-86, and, in 1967, the second was redefined in terms of the hyperfine transition frequency of the ground state of caesium-133.|$|E

5000|$|The term {{contrasts}} with free climbing in which <b>progress</b> <b>is</b> <b>made</b> without using artificial aids: a free climber ascends by only holding onto and stepping on natural {{features of the}} rock, using rope and equipment merely to catch them in case of fall and provide belay.|$|R
