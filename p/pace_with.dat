5|$|Loggers felled {{massive amounts}} of forest in the 1920s and 1930s. Reforestation efforts began in the 1940s because natural {{regeneration}} could not keep <b>pace</b> <b>with</b> the rate of logging. In 1962, the Columbus Day Storm knocked many more large trees to the ground. Today, old-growth forest covers only about {{five percent of the}} watershed.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Nigerian civil war, Nigeria was {{self-sufficient}} in food. Agriculture {{has failed}} to keep <b>pace</b> <b>with</b> Nigeria's rapid population growth, and Nigeria now relies upon food imports to sustain itself. The Nigerian government promoted the use of inorganic fertilizers in the 1970s.|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the importance of}} different atrioventricular intervals during exercise in patients with dual chamber pacemakers, seven patients with complete heart block and sinus rhythm were exercised in different pacing modes and atrioventricular intervals: (a) ventricular inhibited (VVI) <b>pacing</b> <b>with</b> no synchronous atrial augmentation or rate responsiveness; (b) atrial synchronous ventricular or DDD <b>pacing</b> <b>with</b> a short mean (SD) atrioventricular interval of 66 (4) ms; and (c) DDD <b>pacing</b> <b>with</b> a long atrioventricular interval of 168 (12) ms. <b>Pacing</b> <b>with</b> a short or long atrioventricular interval gave similar maximum heart rates, oxygen uptake at the anaerobic threshold, end tidal pressure of carbon dioxide or oxygen pulse (a measure of stroke volume). <b>Pacing</b> <b>with</b> either a short or long atrioventricular interval produced a significantly higher oxygen consumption and anaerobic threshold and less lactate production than VVI pacing. During exercise a short atrioventricular interval {{does not provide a}} better cardiopulmonary performance than a long atrioventricular interval...|$|R

5|$|Berg {{station was}} opened on 10 October 1934, when the municipally owned company Akersbanerne had {{completed}} the Sognsvann Line from Majorstuen to Sognsvann. Residential areas at Sogn, Tåsen and Berg were starting to grow, in <b>pace</b> <b>with</b> a larger suburban development plan. Akersbanerne bought new property along the line, upon which new houses were to be designed by the Norwegian architect Kristofer Lange (1886–1977).|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{to ensure}} that the number of SMCs kept <b>pace</b> <b>with</b> the {{increase}} in voters and hence the number of MPs, the EBRC's terms of reference would state that there should be at least 12 SMCs. The rationale given for these changes was that the GRC scheme would work better and the link between voters and their MPs would be strengthened. In the 2011 general election, SMCs returned to Parliament 12 MPs and 15 GRCs a total of 75 MPs.|$|E

Cotto dominated {{the fourth and fifth}} rounds managing to land combinations on N'dou's head. N'dou won the seventh and eighth rounds after landing more accurate hits than Cotto. The last three rounds were even with both fighters establishing short periods of control in the fight. The judges gave Cotto scores of 117-111, 116-112 and 115-113.|$|E
5|$|Rwanda is {{a country}} of few natural resources, {{and the economy is}} based mostly on {{subsistence}} agriculture by local farmers using simple tools. An estimated 90% of the working population farms, and agriculture constituted an estimated 32.5% of GDP in 2014. Farming techniques are basic, with small plots of land and steep slopes. Since the mid-1980s, farm sizes and food production have been decreasing, {{due in part to the}} resettlement of displaced people. Despite Rwanda's fertile ecosystem, food production often does not keep <b>pace</b> <b>with</b> population growth, and food imports are required.|$|E

5|$|Tiger sharks {{have a large}} upper lobe, {{which allows}} for slow {{cruising}} and sudden bursts of speed. The tiger shark {{must be able to}} twist and turn in the water easily when hunting to support its varied diet, whereas the porbeagle shark, which hunts schooling fish such as mackerel and herring, has a large lower lobe to help it keep <b>pace</b> <b>with</b> its fast-swimming prey. Other tail adaptations help sharks catch prey more directly, such as the thresher shark's usage of its powerful, elongated upper lobe to stun fish and squid.|$|E
5|$|To be most {{effective}} at controlling a pest, a biological control agent requires a colonizing ability which allows it to keep <b>pace</b> <b>with</b> changes to the habitat in space and time. Control is greatest if the agent has temporal persistence, {{so that it can}} maintain its population even in the temporary absence of the target species, and if it is an opportunistic forager, enabling it to rapidly exploit a pest population.|$|E
5|$|As the eruptions continued, {{they became}} {{concentrated}} at one vent along the fissure {{and began to}} build the island into a more circular shape. By 24 November, the island measured about 900metres by 650metres (2950 by 2130ft). The violent explosions caused by the meeting of lava and sea water meant that the island consisted of a loose pile of volcanic rock (scoria), which was eroded rapidly by North Atlantic storms during the winter. However, eruptions more than kept <b>pace</b> <b>with</b> wave erosion, and by February 1964, the island had a maximum diameter of over 1300metres (4265ft).|$|E
40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} after {{coronary artery}} bypass surgery occurs in 30 to 40 % of patients. Prophylactic therapy with drugs is not always possible and not always efficient. Atrial pacing {{may play a role}} in the prevention of atrial fibrillation. Biatrial <b>pacing</b> <b>with</b> fixed high rate or overdrive and right atrial <b>pacing</b> <b>with</b> overdrive has been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of atrial fibrillation after {{coronary artery bypass}} surgery. Avoidance of undersensing and loss of capture with atrial epicardial wires is a technical challenge. Individually tailored and combined approaches are promising future directions for prophylactic therapy...|$|R

5|$|Chambers {{reflected}} {{on drug use}} in athletics {{in an interview with}} Olympic gold medallist Sir Matthew Pinsent for the BBC's Inside Sport programme. Chambers claimed there would always be athletes using performance-enhancing drugs because drug testers did not keep <b>pace</b> <b>with</b> advances in science and that athletes who took drugs had an immense advantage over those who remained clean. Chambers was roundly condemned for his comments in the interview by both the press and his former colleagues in the athletics world, including Sir Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah, and Sebastian Coe, although former 100m world record holder Asafa Powell supported Chambers' claims.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{suffering}} {{shortages of}} pilots and equipment, No.84 Wing was generally {{able to keep}} <b>pace</b> <b>with</b> the army's requirements. A detachment of No.36 Squadron, flying C-47 Dakotas, was employed to augment the wing's supply capabilities. Up {{until the end of}} June 1945, No.5 Squadron had flown almost 2,000 sorties and No.17 AOP Flight over 1,300, while No.10 Local Air Supply Unit and the No.36 Squadron detachment had accounted for almost 1,000 between them. As the navigational efficiency of the New Zealander pilots increased, demands on the Boomerangs and Wirraways lessened, and the bulk of the reconnaissance duties fell to the Austers of No.17 AOP Flight.|$|E
5|$|Gomez proved {{his critics}} wrong {{when he arrived}} at the fight in prime {{condition}} and with aggression, determination and desire. The first two rounds started at a furious <b>pace,</b> <b>with</b> Arthur keeping Gomez at bay with stiff jabs and Gomez working inside with hooks and body punches. The match was turning into a clash of opposing styles, Arthur displaying control and boxing technique and Gomez storming forward with wild ferocity. From the third round the fight began to turn Gomez's way. Gomez cut Arthur in the third and silenced the home crowd, who were not used to seeing the home-town hero being battered in this manner. Gomez dominated the fourth round and was in full control of the fight—he exposed Arthur's weak defence and at one stage landed 28 punches without reply.|$|E

5|$|Grandmaster Flash {{suggests}} that Herc {{may not have}} kept <b>pace</b> <b>with</b> developments in techniques of cueing (lining up a record to play at a certain place on it). Developments changed techniques of cutting (switching from one record to another) and scratching (moving the record by hand to and fro under the stylus for percussive effect) in the late 1970s. Herc said he retreated from the scene after being stabbed at the Executive Playhouse while trying to intercede in a fight, and the burning down {{of one of his}} venues. In 1980, Herc had stopped DJing and was working in a record shop in South Bronx.|$|E
5|$|In Egypt, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps were {{defeated}} by British forces under Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery in October 1942. The Allies landed in Sicily in July 1943 and in Italy in September. Meanwhile, American and British bomber fleets based in Britain began operations against Germany {{and in an}} effort to destroy German morale many sorties were intentionally given civilian targets. Soon German aircraft production could not keep <b>pace</b> <b>with</b> losses and without air cover the Allied bombing campaign became even more devastating. By targeting oil refineries and factories, they crippled the German war effort by late 1944.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to habitat destruction, the pygmy slow loris is seriously threatened by hunting and trade. Within its geographic range and neighbor countries, {{the trade in}} the pygmy slow loris has recently increased due to economic changes and human population growth, and the trend is expected to continue. Decreased sightings {{in the field and}} at animal markets indicate that wild populations are being depleted since the low reproduction rate of the pygmy slow loris cannot keep <b>pace</b> <b>with</b> these large-scale off-takes. Accordingly, conservationists and field biologists fear local extinctions in the near future. Between 1998 and 2006, 70% of pygmy slow lorises seized by authorities died before reaching a sheltering zoo, resulting in replacement demand and additional captures from the wild.|$|E
