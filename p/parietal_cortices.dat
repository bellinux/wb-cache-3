We previously reported that reboxetine and desipramine, two selective norepinephrine transporter (NET) blockers, at doses that maximally increase DA in the prefrontal cortex, do not increase DA in the <b>parietal</b> and occipital <b>cortices.</b> In the present study, {{we performed a}} full dose-response study {{of the effect of}} systemic reboxetine and desipramine on DA and NA in dialysates from the <b>parietal</b> and occipital <b>cortices.</b> Seven doses of reboxetine (0. 1, 0. 25, 0. 5, 1. 0, 2. 5, 5. 0 and 10 mg/kg) and four doses of desipramine (0. 25, 1. 0, 2. 5 and 5. 0 mg/kg) were tested. Reboxetine and desipramine differentially affected dialysate DA as compared with NA. Reboxetine increased DA maximally by about 100 % after doses of 0. 25 - 0. 5 mg/kg and showed a bell-shaped dose-response function in both areas; desipramine did not affect DA in the parietal cortex and increased it in the occipital cortex only at 2. 5 mg/kg. NA was maximally increased by 275 % by 0. 5 - 2. 5 mg/kg reboxetine and by about 300 % by 5. 0 mg/kg desipramine with a more linear dose-response curve. The mechanism of peculiar dose-response function of dialysate DA after reboxetine and desipramine was further investigated by testing the effect of drugs on dialysate DA and NA under alpha(2) receptor blockade. Under local perfusion of the occipital cortex with idazoxan, an otherwise ineffective dose of reboxetine and desipramine (5 mg/kg) became effective in raising extracellular DA.

This study aimed at investigating the relationship between changes in synchrony and degree of LOC during parietal lobe epilepsy (PLE), a form of epilepsy in which seizures directly involve the <b>parietal</b> associative <b>cortices.</b> METHODS: Ten patients undergoing stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) during presurgical evaluation of PLE were studied. The LOC intensity was scored using the Conscious Seizure Scale (CSS). For each studied seizure (n = 29), interdependencies between signals recorded from six brain regions were estimated {{as a function of}} time by using nonlinear regression analysis (h(2) coefficient). KEY FINDINGS: Seizures were divided into three groups according to the CSS scale: group A (no LOC) with a score ≤ 1, group B (intermediate or partial LOC) with a score ranging from 2 to 5, and group C (maximal LOC) with a score ≥ 6. The majority of seizures in patients with PLE disclosed significant LOC (17 / 29, group C). Mean h(2) values were significantly different between the three groups (p = 0. 008), the maximal values of synchrony being observed in group C. In addition, a statistically significant nonlinear relationship (p = 0. 0021) was found between the h(2) values and the CSS scores, suggesting a threshold effect.

40|$|GABA is {{the primary}} {{inhibitory}} neurotransmitter in human brain. The level of GABA varies substantially across individuals, and this variability is associated with interindividual differences in visual perception. However, it remains unclear whether the association between GABA level and visual perception reflects a general influence of visual inhibition or whether the GABA levels of different cortical regions selectively influence perception of different visual features. To address this, we studied how the GABA levels of <b>parietal</b> and occipital <b>cortices</b> related to interindividual differences in size, orientation, and brightness perception. We used visual contextual illusion as a perceptual assay since the illusion dissociates perceptual content from stimulus content and {{the magnitude of the}} illusion reflects the effect of visual inhibition.

Specifically, parietal GABA level correlated with size illusion magnitude but not with orientation or brightness illusion magnitude; in contrast, occipital GABA level correlated with orientation illusion magnitude but not with size or brightness illusion magnitude. Our findings reveal a region- and feature-dependent influence of GABA level on human visual perception. <b>Parietal</b> and occipital <b>cortices</b> contain, respectively, topographic maps of size and orientation preference in which neural responses to stimulus sizes and stimulus orientations are modulated by intraregional lateral connections.

50|$|Despite {{the growing}} {{currency}} of the 'biasing' model of executive functions, direct evidence for functional connectivity between the PFC and sensory regions when executive functions are used, is to date rather sparse. Indeed, the only direct evidence comes from {{studies in which}} a portion of frontal cortex is damaged, and a corresponding effect is observed far from the lesion site, in the responses of sensory neurons. However, few studies have explored whether this effect is specific to situations where executive functions are required. Other methods for measuring connectivity between distant brain regions, such as correlation in the fMRI response, have yielded indirect evidence that the frontal cortex and sensory regions communicate during a variety of processes thought to engage executive functions, such as working memory, but more research is required to establish how information flows between the PFC {{and the rest of}} the brain when executive functions are used. As an early step in this direction, an fMRI study on the flow of information processing during visuospatial reasoning has provided evidence for causal associations (inferred from the temporal order of activity) between sensory-related activity in occipital and <b>parietal</b> <b>cortices</b> and activity in posterior and anterior PFC.

50|$|Alain et al. {{utilized}} {{a delayed}} match to sample task {{in which participants}} held an initial tone in memory, comparing it to a second tone presented 500 ms later. Although the set of stimuli tones remained the same throughout the experiment, task blocks alternated between pitch and spatial comparisons. For example, during pitch comparison blocks, participants were instructed to report whether the second stimulus was higher, lower, or equal in pitch relative to the first pitch, regardless of the two tones spatial locations. Conversely, during spatial comparison blocks, participants were instructed to report whether the second tone was leftward, rightward, or equal in space relative to the first tone, regardless of tone pitch. This task was used in two experiments, one utilizing fMRI and one ERP, to gauge the spatial and temporal properties, respectively, of 'what' and 'where' auditory processing. Comparing the pitch and spatial judgements revealed increased activation in primary auditory cortices and right inferior frontal gyrus during the pitch task, and increased activation in bilateral posterior temporal areas, and inferior and superior <b>parietal</b> <b>cortices</b> during the spatial task. The ERP results revealed divergence between the pitch and spatial tasks at 300-500 ms following {{the onset of the}} first stimulus, in the form of increased positivity in inferior frontotemporal regions with the pitch task, and increased positivity over centroparietal regions during the spatial task. This suggested that, similar to what is thought to occur in vision, elements of an auditory scene are split into separate 'what' (ventral) and 'where' (dorsal) pathways, however it was unclear if this similarity {{is the result of a}} supramodal division of feature and spatial processes.|$|E

5000|$|Recognition {{memory is}} {{critically}} {{dependent on a}} hierarchically organized network of brain areas including the visual ventral stream, medial temporal lobe structures, frontal lobe and <b>parietal</b> <b>cortices</b> along with the hippocampus. As mentioned previously, the processes of recollection and familiarity are represented differently in the brain. As such, each of the regions listed above can be further subdivided according to which part is primarily involved in recollection or in familiarity. In the temporal cortex, for instance, the medial region is related to recollection whereas the anterior region is related to familiarity. Similarly, in the parietal cortex, the lateral region is related to recollection whereas the superior region is related to familiarity. An even more specific account divides the medial parietal region, relating the posterior cingulate to recollection and the precuneus to familiarity. The hippocampus plays {{a prominent role in}} recollection whereas familiarity depends heavily on the surrounding medial-temporal regions, especially the perirhinal cortex. Finally, it is not yet clear what specific regions of the prefrontal lobes are associated with recollection versus familiarity, although there is evidence that the left prefrontal cortex is correlated more strongly with recollection whereas the right prefrontal cortex is involved more in familiarity. Though left-side activation involved in recollection was originally hypothesized to result from semantic processing of words (many of these earlier studies used written words for stimuli) subsequent studies using nonverbal stimuli produced the same finding—suggesting that prefrontal activation in the left hemisphere results from any kind of detailed remembering. [...] As previously mentioned, recognition memory is not a stand-alone concept; rather it is a highly interconnected and integrated sub-system of memory. Perhaps misleadingly, the regions of the brain listed above correspond to an abstract and highly generalized understanding of recognition memory, in which the stimuli or items-to-be-recognized are not specified. In reality, however, the location of brain activation involved in recognition is highly dependent {{on the nature of the}} stimulus itself. Consider the conceptual differences in recognizing written words compared to recognizing human faces. These are two qualitatively different tasks and as such it is not surprising that they involve additional, distinct regions of the brain. Recognizing words, for example, involves the visual word form area, a region in the left fusiform gyrus, which is believed to specialized in recognizing written words. Similarly, the fusiform face area, located in the right hemisphere, is linked specifically to the recognition of faces.|$|E
