40|$|Staphylococcal {{bacteremia}} was induced in {{two groups}} of rabbits that were pairfed high protein and protein deficient diets. Marked deviations in response were observed {{as a result of}} protein deficiency: a) blood clearance of S aureus was delayed; b) <b>persistence</b> <b>and</b> <b>multiplication</b> of bacteria in blood and tissues were pronounced; c) neutrophilic response was poor and transitory; d) mortality was very high and occurred very early and e) focal necrotizing lesions, rather than well-formed abscesses, were found in organs...|$|E
40|$|Microbial {{pathogenicity}} in Staphylococcus aureus is {{a complex}} process involving a number of virulence genes that are regulated by global regulatory systems including sar and agr. To evaluate the roles of these two loci in virulence, we constructed sar-/agr- mutants of strains RN 6390 and RN 450 and compared their phenotypic profiles to the corresponding single sar- and agr- mutants and parents. The secretion of all hemolysins was absent in the sar-/agr- mutants while residual beta-hemolysin activity remained in single agr- mutants. The fibronectin binding capacity was significantly diminished in both single sar- mutants and double mutants when compared with parents while the reduction in fibrinogen binding capacity in the double mutants was modest. In the rabbit endocarditis model, {{there was a significant}} decrease in both infectivity rates and intravegetation bacterial densities with the double mutant as compared to the parent (RN 6390) at 10 (3) - 10 (6) CFU inocula despite comparable levels of early bacteremia among various challenge groups. Notably, fewer bacteria in the double mutant group adhered to valvular vegetations at 30 min after challenge (10 (6) CFU) than the parent group. These studies suggest that both the sar and agr loci are involved in initial valvular adherence, intravegetation <b>persistence</b> <b>and</b> <b>multiplication</b> of S. aureus in endocarditis...|$|E
40|$|A {{therapeutic}} trial with topical bromovinyldeoxyuridine (BVDU) plus low-dosage steroids {{was conducted in}} five patients with chronic zoster keratouveitis, who had previously received topical acyclovir (ACV) and steroids. In all cases, BVDU (plus steroids) {{was found to be}} superior to ACV (plus steroids). Yet BVDU was not able to keep the patients from having chronic relapsing varicella-zoster keratouveitis. This can probably be explained by pathophysiological reasons, i. e., the <b>persistence</b> <b>and</b> low-grade <b>multiplication</b> of the varicella-zoster virus in peripheral eye tissues during the chronic carrier stage. It is possible that this chronic carrier status could be obviated by vigorous antiviral treatment during the acute phase of the illness. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSince calcium-signaling regulates {{specific}} and fundamental cellular processes, {{it represents the}} ideal target of viral proteins, {{in order for the}} virus to control cellular functions <b>and</b> favour its <b>persistence,</b> <b>multiplication</b> <b>and</b> spread. A detailed analysis of reports focused on the impact of viral proteins on calcium-signaling has shown that virus-related elevations of cytosolic calcium levels allow increased viral protein expression (HIV- 1, HSV- 1 / 2), viral replication (HBx, enterovirus 2 B, HTLV- 1 p 12 I, HHV- 8, EBV), viral maturation (rotavirus), viral release (enterovirus 2 B) and cell immortalization (EBV). Interestingly, virus-induced decreased cytosolic calcium levels {{have been found to be}} associated with inhibition of immune cells functions (HIV- 1 Tat, HHV- 8 K 15, EBV LMP 2 A). Finally, several viral proteins are able to modulate intracellular calcium-signaling to control cell viability (HIV- 1 Tat, HTLV- 1 p 13 II, HCV core, HBx, enterovirus 2 B, HHV- 8 K 7). These data point out calcium-signaling as a key cellular target for viral infection and should stimulate further studies exploring new calcium-related therapeutic strategies...|$|R
40|$|In {{the oral}} cavity, gingival {{epithelial}} cell (GEC) layers {{function as an}} innate host defense system to prevent intrusion by periodontal bacteria. Nevertheless, Porphyromonas gingivalis, the most well-known periodontal pathogen, can enter GECs and pass through the epithelial barrier into deeper tissues. An intracellular location is considered advantageous for bacteria to escape from immune surveillance by the host as well as antibiotic pressure, leading to intracellular <b>persistence,</b> <b>multiplication</b> <b>and</b> dissemination to adjacent tissues. P. gingivalis are invaginated by gingival epithelial cells via the endocytic pathway, and some intracellular bacteria are sorted to lytic compartments, including autolysosomes and late endosomes/lysosomes, while {{a considerable number of}} the remaining organisms are sorted to Rab 11 - and RalA-positive recycling endosomes, followed by bacterial exit from the cells. Exited bacteria can re-enter fresh cells. However, dominant negative forms and RNAi-knockdown of Rab 11, RalA and exocyst complex subunits (Sec 5, Sec 6 and Exo 84) significantly disturb the exit of P. gingivalis. These are the first known results to show that the endocytic recycling pathway mediates bacterial exit from infected cells to neighboring cells and may provide important information regarding the exit mechanisms of various invasive pathogens...|$|R
