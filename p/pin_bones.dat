An analysis of variance of the weight and bovinemetric measurements was conducted on 1. 402 animals, with information gathered on the technical visits (from 2008 to 2014) to 63 ranches belonging to ASOSENEPOL, located at the regions of: Caribbean, Interandean and Orinoquia – Amazonia Valleys. The animals were classified under sex, region and age group, and an analysis of multiple regression was made in order to select the bovinemetric measurements with the greatest effect on weight (p< 0. 0001). Results. In females: hip width and rump length were significant (p< 0. 0001). In males: hip width, rump length, rump height, body length and <b>pin</b> <b>bone</b> width were significant (p< 0. 0001). The variation in weight for females was related to bovinemetric measurements associated to meat production (thoracic perimeter, body length and rump height), with easy calving (hip width, <b>pin</b> <b>bone</b> width and rump length). For males, the variation in weight was observed in bovinemetric measurements associated to meat production like hip width, <b>pin</b> <b>bone</b> width, rump length, and testicular circumference.

40|$|<b>Pin</b> <b>bones</b> {{represent}} {{a major problem}} for processing and quality of fish products. Development of methods of removal requires better knowledge of the pin bones’ attachment to the muscle and structures involved in the breakdown during loosening. In this study, <b>pin</b> <b>bones</b> from cod and salmon were dissected from fish fillets after slaughter or storage on ice for 5 days, and thereafter analysed with molecular methods, which revealed major differences between these species before and after storage. The connective tissue (CT) attaches the pin bone to the muscle in cod, while the <b>pin</b> <b>bones</b> in salmon are embedded in adipose tissue. Collagens, elastin, lectin-binding proteins and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are all components of the attachment site, and this differ between salmon and cod, resulting in a CT in cod that is more resistant to enzymatic degradation compared to the CT in salmon. Structural differences are reflected in the composition of transcriptome. Microarray analysis comparing the attachment sites of the <b>pin</b> <b>bones</b> with a reference muscle sample showed limited differences in salmon. In cod, on the other hand, the variances were substantial, and the gene expression profiles suggested difference in myofibre structure, metabolism and cell processes between the pin bone attachment site and the reference muscle. Degradation of the connective tissue occurs closest to the <b>pin</b> <b>bones</b> and not in the neighbouring tissue, which was shown using light microscopy. This study shows that the attachment of the <b>pin</b> <b>bones</b> in cod and salmon is different; therefore, the development of methods for removal should be tailored to each individual species...|$|E
40|$|Post mortem {{storage is}} a {{necessary}} process for removal of <b>pin</b> <b>bones</b> without destruction of fillets, thereby avoiding volume and economic loss. However, the enzymes involved in loosening <b>pin</b> <b>bones</b> during storage have not been studied to a great extent. In this study, the activities and localization of MMPs in the connective tissue (CT) of <b>pin</b> <b>bones</b> dissected from fillet of salmon and cod were investigated. Interestingly, the enzyme activity profile in these two species was different during post mortem storage of fish fillets. Adding MMP inhibitor (GM 6001) and serine protease inhibitor (Pefabloc) revealed different effects in the two species, suggesting different regulations in salmon and cod. In situ zymography with the same inhibitors verified MMP and serine protease activity in CT close to pin bone at early post mortem (6 h) in salmon. However, MMP inhibition was not evident in cod in this area at that time point. Immunohistochemistry further revealed MMP 9 and MMP 13 were located more to the outer rim of CT, facing the pin bone and adipose tissue, while MMP 7 was more randomly distributed within CT in salmon. In contrast, all these three MMPs were randomly distributed in CT in cod. In summary, our study reveals different MMP enzyme profiles in salmon and cod in the pin bone area, influenced by serine proteases, and suggests that MMPs and serine proteases must be taken in consideration when studying the conditions for early pin bone removal...|$|E

The {{data were}} subjected to linkage analysis for the detection and mapping of segregating quantitative trait loci (QTL) influencing live weight, average daily gain and body measurements at weaning. Probability coefficients of inheriting allele 1 or 2 from the sire at specific chromosomal intervals were computed. The phenotypic data on progeny were regressed on these probability coefficients in a within-common-parent regression analysis. Fixed effects of sex, parity and season of birth as well as age as a covariate, were fitted in a linear model to the phenotypic data and subsequently analysed using QTL Express by generating an F-statistic through permutation tests at chromosome-wide significance thresholds over 10, 000 iterations at 1 cM intervals. Highly significant (P< 0. 01) segregating QTL for body measurements were detected on BTA 2 for hip width (1 cM) and chest depth (8 cM) in Sire Family 1 and <b>pin</b> <b>bone</b> width (16 cM) in Sire Family 3. Other significant QTL (P< 0. 05) detected were withers height (3 cM), hip height (4 cM), body length (4 cM), shoulder width (6 cM), lumbar width (3 cM), thurl width (3 cM) and canon circumference (2 cM) in Sire Family 1, shoulder width (16 cM) in Sire Family 3 and thurl width (24 cM), <b>pin</b> <b>bone</b> width (19 cM), heart girth (26 cM) and abdominal width (69 cM) in Sire Family 4.

The goal with the thesis work is to further develop an existing prototype. In order to achieve the goal a pre-study of the prototype had to be made in order to define a customer demand specification. The thesis work is then continued by a function analysis which differs from a conservative one.  For each sub-function various sub solutions a made. The advantage of this method is that it results in various total solutions which after an evaluation one will be chosen for further development. To examine if the fully developed prototype achieved the given demands a test specification was made. The tests resulted in success, however later in the thesis it is recommended to perform tests on a real prototype to ensure that the given demands are fulfilled. These tests however are not a part of this thesis. The economic sub goal with the thesis was not properly fulfilled, however the remaining goals was fulfilled successfully.   The result of the thesis was an improved prototype, manufacturing documentation of the prototype and a suggestion of material change that could lead to reduced total costs. ...|$|R

Although originally developed for human medicine, HIFU may also be used to weaken the attachment of <b>pin</b> <b>bones</b> in fish fillets to enable easier removal of such bones. This was shown in the present study, where a series of experiments were performed on HIFU phantoms and fillets of cod and salmon. In thin objects such as fish fillets, the heat is mainly dissipated at the surfaces. However, bones inside the fillet absorb ultrasound energy more efficiently than the surrounding tissue, resulting in a “self-focusing” heating of the bones. Salmon skin was found to effectively block the ultrasound, resulting in a significantly lower heating effect in fillets with skin. Cod skin partly blocked the ultrasound, but only to a small degree, enabling HIFU treatment through the skin. The treatment of fillets to reduce the pin bone attachment yielded an average reduction in the required pulling force by 50 % in cod fillets with skin, with little muscle denaturation, and 72 % in skinned fillets, with significant muscle denaturation. Salmon fillets were treated from the muscle side of the fillet to circumvent the need for penetration through skin.

Also, weight records of 22, 778 animals born from 1998 to 2003, in ten farms across six Brazilian states were used. Carcass traits as measured by ultrasound of the live animal were recorded from 2002 to 2004 in 2590 males and females with ages varying from 450 to 599 days. Fixed models including farm, year and season of birth, sex and type of feed effects, and the covariates age of dam (AOD) and age of animal at measurement were used to study the effect of environmental factors on these traits. The genetic parameters for LMA, BF and RF were estimated with two and three-trait animal models with 120 -day weights using a restricted maximum likelihood method. All environmental effects significantly affected carcass traits, with the exception of year of birth for BF and RF and AOD for LMA. The heritability estimates for LMA, BF and RF were 0. 35, 0. 51 and 0. 39, respectively. Standard errors obtained in one-trait analyses were from 0. 07 to 0. 09. Genetic correlation estimates between LMA and the two traits of subcutaneous fat were low (close to zero) and 0. 74 between BF and RF, indicating that the selection for LMA should not cause antagonism in the genetic improvement of subcutaneous fat measured by real-time ultrasound.

40|$|Body {{condition}} scoring is {{a common}} tool to assess the subcutaneous fat reserves of dairy cows. Because of its subjectivity, which causes limits in repeatability, it is often discussed controversially. Aim {{of the current study}} was to evaluate the impact of considering the cows overall appearance on the scoring process and on the validity of the results. Therefore, two different methods to reveal body condition scores (BCS), ‘independent BCS' (iBCS) and ‘dependent BCS' (dBCS), were used to assess 1111 Swiss Brown Cattle. The iBCS and the dBCS systems were both working with the same flowchart with a decision tree structure for visual and palpatory assessment using a scale from 2 to 5 with increment units of 0. 25. The iBCS was created strictly complying with the defined frames of the decision tree structure. The system was chosen due to its formularized approach to reduce the influence of subjective impressions. By contrast, the dBCS system, which was in line with common practice, had a more open approach, where - besides the decision tree - the overall impression of the cow's physical appearance was taken into account for generating the final score. Ultrasound measurement of the back fat thickness (BFT) was applied as a validation method. The dBCS {{turned out to be the}} better predictor of BFT, explaining 67. 3 % of the variance. The iBCS was only able to explain 47. 3 % of the BFT variance. Within the whole data set, only 31. 3 % of the animals received identical dBCS and iBCS. The pin bone region caused the most deviations between dBCS and iBCS, but also assessing the pelvis line, the hook bones and the ligaments led to divergences in around 20 % of the scored animals. The study showed that during the assessment of body condition a strict adherence to a decision tree is a possible source of inexact classifications. Some body regions, especially the <b>pin</b> <b>bones,</b> proved to be particularly challenging for scoring due to difficulties in assessing them. All the more, the inclusion of the overall appearance of the cow into the assessment process counteracted these errors and led to a fair predictability of BFT with the flowchart-based BCS. This might be particularly important, if different cattle types and breeds are assesse...|$|E
40|$|Residual {{feed intake}} (RFI) is a feed {{efficiency}} trait {{defined as the}} difference between actual feed intake and the one predicted {{on the basis of}} requirements for production and maintenance of body weight. Evidence exists of a positive correlation between RFI and fat thickness in Bos taurus, suggesting that low RFI cattle (feed efficient ones) are leaner. The objective {{of this study was to}} access the relationship between fat thickness and RFI by partial correlation including all animals (n= 603, 300 bulls and 303 heifers), and by means comparison including only animals divergently classified by RFI (low RFI, n= 192 and high RFI, n= 186). The animals were born from 2004 to 2010, and were performance tested after weaning for 56 to 112 days, depending of test year and sex. The average age and body weight at the beginning of performance test were 286 ± 42 days and 225 ± 51 kg. At the end of performance test images of backfat thickness (BF) were obtained by ultrasound (Pie Medical-Aquila- 3. 5 MHz linear probe) between the 12 th and 13 th ribs, transversely over the longissimus muscle. Images of rump fat thickness (RF) were obtained at the junction of the gluteus medius and biceps femoris muscles between the hook and <b>pin</b> <b>bones.</b> The images were saved and subsequently analyzed using Echo Image Viewer 1. 0. For partial correlations (MANOVA, SAS 9. 3), the model included fixed effect of contemporary group (GC=year, sex and installation) and age of the beginning of performance test and age of ultrasound fat measurement (average of 373 ± 42 days) as covariates (linear effect). For means comparison (GLM, SAS 9. 3), the model included fixed effects of GC, RFI classes (only low RFI and high RFI, excluding medium RFI) and age of beginning of performance test. Partial correlations between fat thickness and RFI were close to zero (- 0. 006 for BF and 0. 010 for RF). Reinforcing these results, there were no significant differences of BF and RF from feed efficient (low RFI class) and feed inefficient animals (high RFI class), although there were significant difference between them on the dry matter intake independently of average daily gain (ADG) and metabolic body weight. These results show that animals with low RFI have lower feed intake, similar ADG and subcutaneous fat thickness than high RFI animals, fact that is desirable for slaughterhouses and consumers...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the mature size and the growth pattern of ten body measurements, namely withers height, hip height, body length, chest girth, chest depth, chest width, rump length, hip width, thurl width and <b>pin</b> <b>bone</b> width of bulls and heifers of Bali cattle reared under traditional rearing system in Bone and Barru district, South Sulawesi, Indonesia. The data of the above measurements of 108 bulls and 146 heifers at Bone district and 152 bulls and 110 heifers at Barru district (age ranged from 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 months) were used to fit Brody growth curve models to estimate of mature size for the ten size measurements. The result showed that the growth of body measurements of Bali cattle until 24 months of age were still increasing and not reaching the mature size yet. The place, sex and age factors were significantly affected to the growth of body measurements of Bali cattle...|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} movements between {{vertebral bodies}} T 10 and T 11, and T 11 and T 12 were measured during clinical-type SMTs to T 11 in unembalmed post-rigor human cadavers, using embedded stainless steel <b>bone</b> <b>pins</b> and high speed cinematography. Significant relative movements between target and adjacent vertebrae occurred primarily in sagittal and axial rotation during the thrust {{phases of the}} SMTs. The relative positions of the vertebral bodies were compared at similar force levels, {{before and after the}} rapid thrust phases. The sagittal angles between T 11 and T 12 following the SMTs, were significantly different from their pre-thrust values. Two non-invasive methods (surface markers and uni-axial accelerometers) were compared to the invasive <b>bone</b> <b>pins,</b> in order to assess their suitability to accurately measure posterior-anterior translation. The results showed that both non-invasive techniques significantly underestimated the absolute movements of all vertebral bodies during the SMTs. The relative posterior-anterior translations using the non-invasive techniques however, were not significantly different from those determined from the <b>bone</b> <b>pins...</b>|$|R
40|$|Two {{different}} methods to reveal body condition scores (BCS), called independent BCS (iBCS) and dependent BCS (dBCS; {{similar to the}} method of Ferguson et al. 1994), were applied in 1111 Swiss Brown dairy cows. Ultrasound measurement of the back fat thickness (BFT) served as validation method. Aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the impact of assessor’s subjective impression of the overall appearance of the cow on the scoring process. With 67. 3 % of the BFT variance, the dBCS with its consideration of the overall impression of the cow and its more open approach was more suitable to predict the subcutaneous fat appositions. The strictly formularized iBCS could only explain 47. 3 % of the BFT variance. The <b>pin</b> <b>bone</b> region was identified to cause the biggest assessing problems. To summarize, including the overall impression of the cow is decisive to gain valid results, especially when the body condition scoring system is applied to different cattle types and breeds...|$|R
