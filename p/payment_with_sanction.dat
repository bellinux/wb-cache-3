This project will comprise a London workshop bringing together policy-makers and practitioners to explore Iran sanctions {{in the specific}} context of the insurance industry. The obligation to comply <b>with</b> <b>sanctions</b> constitutes an important commercial consideration with numerous associated challenges that vary considerably according to sector. Implementation can be costly and complex and {{it can be difficult to}} determine whether compliance policies and procedures meet the challenges. However, the consequences of being found in non-compliance <b>with</b> <b>sanctions</b> are significant. Firms thus have a strong interest in fully understanding and keeping pace with intricate and rapidly-evolving sanctions regimes.
