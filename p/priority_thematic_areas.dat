40|$|JPI Oceans aims {{to address}} broad <b>priority</b> <b>thematic</b> <b>areas</b> which {{lie at the}} intersections of the marine environment, climate change and human activities. In order to {{understand}} these interactions, capacities {{in terms of human}} resources and infrastructures are required. Because of {{the very nature of the}} marine system and climate interaction, there is a need for sustained long-time series as well as integrated observations bringing together physical, chemical, and biological data of the different parts of the seas and oceans. Added to this is the need for geological data to understand hazards and risk, in addition to measurements of sediments for instance in river basins, to measure natural historical vs. human induced climate change. All these infrastructures for ocean observation (permanent, temporary and exploratory) and experimentation/testing are expensive to build, upgrade, maintain and to operate and will benefit from the European planning approach offered by the JPI Oceans mechanism. In order to identify where JPI Oceans can add value in the field of infrastructures and human capacity building, this work package first conducted a mapping of existing infrastructures, observation/data and human capacity building based on a broad stakeholders consultation. The mapping exercise and the stakeholders’ consultation demonstrated that Europe benefits from a wide variety of MRI, existing, in continuous development or in construction, with a total of more than 900 facilities. A preliminary analysis allowed to highlight a number of key issues related to each types of marine research infrastructure 2. Regarding Human Capacity Building (HCB), CSA Oceans has built on previous initiatives, in particular the achievements of the SEAS-ERA project to map the European landscape and instruments to support education, training, and mobility 3. This mapping exercise has been completed by the analysis of a case study specifically addressing the ‘jobs of the sea’ issue, targeting technology districts dealing mainly with maritime transport activities. Based on the mapping and an in-depth analysis of the stakeholders consultation, the present report proposes needs and gaps that need to be covered for a sustained observation and collection of marine data and develop a long-term European observation system (Chapter 3.), existing gaps in infrastructures for laboratory research and experimentation in different marine and maritime fields (Chapter 4.), general marine research infrastructures gaps (Chapter 5.), as well as gaps and needs in human capacity building (Chapter 6.). These numerous gaps and needs call for an improved joint programming and coordination of marine RIs and HCB in Europe in terms of management and governing mechanisms. The structure of this report is based on the document “state of play - analysis of stakeholders’ consultation” presented to the JPI Oceans Strategic Advisory Board (StAB) and Management Board (MB) at the Oslo meeting (26 - 27 march 2014). In this structure, each sub-chapter corresponds to a category of needs identified by stakeholders (see also 2. 2 analysis of the stakeholders’ consultation). Relevant gaps for JPI Oceans joint activities are listed for each of these issues. As a next step, Work Package 1 of the CSA Oceans project will integrate output of this gap analyses into a coherent Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA) and recommend joint actions based on an assessment of the suggested proposals...|$|E

The GEF has benefitted from a greater complementarity with UNEP’s regular programming. UNEP’s <b>priorities</b> within six <b>thematic</b> <b>areas</b> defined in its Medium-Term Strategy (MTS) are closely aligned with the GEF priorities specified in its six focal areas.

The UNEP/GEF portfolio continues to make gains in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. Business standards and procedures have been improved, quality of supervision of projects remains high, public disclosure of information and engagement of GEF Operational Focal Points has increased, and last year’s internal reorganization continues to enhance the integration of the GEF portfolio with the regular programme of UNEP for greater complementarity and synergy.

40|$|Much {{has been}} written about the link between {{practice}} and research in the nursing and health literature. The literature from fields of practice relating to care of the older person is no exception. Enhancing best practice to effectively meet the needs and desires of older people, and provide an optimal working environment for those providing that care, requires sustainable synergies between research and practice. However, the perception of a gap(s) between ‘what we know’ and ‘what we do’ persists in the writing in relation to the care of older people, as it does in healthcare more broadly. Rather than attempting to provide an exhaustive descriptive review of the literature, this paper reports on, and provides an analysis of, two broad <b>thematic</b> <b>areas</b> that are reflected in much of the writing about research and practice relevant to the care of older people. The first <b>thematic</b> <b>area</b> relates to literature that presupposes a linear/passive view of research uptake.
