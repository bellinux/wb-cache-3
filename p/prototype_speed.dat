40|$|Security riding is very {{important}} in the aspects of traffic. One of the main factors of traffic accidents is high speed. Therefore, it is required a speed restraint equipment for pressing the number of accidents. The car speed restraint system is available in the market, but on a motorcycle is not available yet. This paper presents a design of speed restraint equipment for motorcycle that safe for users, and is expected to reduce traffic accident. The Main idea this speed restriction is cutting off the flow of electrical signals from the pulser (the time ignition trigger sensor) to the CDI for 1 second. The cutting Signal with mechanical relays controlled by microcontroller AT 89 S 52 using the on-off algorithm. Speed sensor use optocoupler is used to detect the number of rounds wheel motorcycle. If a result of measurement is more than the speed setpoint, microcontroler make a decission to cut motorcycle ignition signal. Results of this research is a <b>prototype</b> <b>speed</b> restraint shown that it able to process data from the measurement of the speed limit on the speed of a motorcycle. This prototype safe for all users and accordance with the set value and the level of success is above 90 % for speed of 10 km/hr to 40 km/hr...|$|E

40|$|Ventilation {{systems can}} utilize 80 {{percent of the}} total thermal-energy {{requirements}} for a livestock confinement building. Optimizing energy expenditure or environmental control is not possible with conventional controls. Improper adjustment of thermostats can result in ventilation rates above the minimum while the supplemental heater is operating. Thermostats can provide undesirable environmental fluctuations. Variable-speed fan controls have difficulties with accuracy and reliability. Operators avoid the use of complex control systems because of their inability to set the controls properly;A single-board microcomputer was selected to provide logical control of the livestock environment. Inside and outside dry-bulb temperature inputs utilize a semiconductor sensor whose current output varies with absolute dry-bulb temperature. A dew-point temperature sensor measures the moisture content of the environment. The static pressure transducers include diaphragms and linear Hall effect sensors. Fan speeds are counted with pulses from digital Hall effect sensors. Operator inputs, the desired dry-bulb temperatures, are attained with the adjustment of the potentiometers. An 8 -bit analog-to-digital converter is interfaced to the microcomputer;Solid state relays control the power to single-speed fans, supplemental heater solenoids, and air inlet motors for air distribution. Eight-bit digital-to-analog converters provide signals to <b>prototype</b> <b>speed</b> controllers which manipulate variable-speed fans. The direction of the air inlet motors is controlled by electromagnetic relays. The operator adjusts the minimum ventilation rate of the variable-speed fans;Software, located in erasable programmable read-only-memory, presents a rational correlation between the ventilation, supplemental heating, and air distribution systems. The ventilation and supplemental heating systems attempt to provide the desired temperatures. The degree of change in ventilation rates is determined by the outside temperature. Variable-speed and single-speed fans function logically together to reduce abrupt fluctuations in airflow. The dew-point temperature is monitored to limit the relative humidity. The micrcomputer utilizes the fan rpm sensors to prevent winds from stalling variable-speed fans. Static pressure is regulated by the air inlets to maintain uniform air distribution. Fans, for summer ventilation, are utilized only during stressful weather conditions, thus conserving electrical energy. The software is written in mnemonic code and converted to machine language with an assembler;The controller, installed in a swine farrowing and nursery room, is operational and entering the system testing phase. Intensive testing is required before the reliability of the design is proven...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{reports on}} the {{combined}} microsimulation and small scale demonstration evaluation of the freeway performance effects of a specific connected vehicle implementation of speed harmonization (The Prototype). The microsimulation testing was performed on a 10 mile stretch of freeway in San Mateo County, California. The small scale field demonstration was performed with 10 equipped vehicles on 17 miles of the I- 5 freeway in Seattle, Washington. The microsimulation analysis evaluated {{the effects of the}} <b>Prototype</b> <b>speed</b> harmonization algorithm on shockwaves, queues, throughput, speed variation, travel time, and reliability, for different response rates for vehicles on the facility. The “response rate” is defined as the combination of the percent of the vehicle fleet with connected vehicle capabilities, the percent of connected vehicles that successfully receive the speed recommendation in a timely manner, and the percent of drivers who having received the recommendation also choose to comply with the recommended speed. Results from the simulation analysis found that the Prototype is likely to significantly reduce the magnitude of the speed differences (shockwaves) between vehicles, even at the 10 -percent response rate. This is considered to benefit safety by reducing the probability of collisions where free-flowing traffic meets the back of a queue. The trade-off for the improved safety is that the Prototype increases the geographic impact of existing bottlenecks on freeway speeds by expanding the upstream distance that is affected by congestion. The small scale field demonstration evaluated the performance of a cell phone based application for communicating vehicle status and receiving recommended speeds and advanced queue warnings using a combination of the cellular network and roadside dedicated short range communication devices via a DSRC antenna installed in the vehicle. The small scale demonstration also evaluated the ability to detect queues via a combination of installed loop detectors in the road and basic safety messages transmitted by the connected vehicles. The small scale field demonstration showed the feasibility of connected vehicle data capture and dissemination functionality using both cellular communications and Dedicated Short Range (DSRC) communications. It demonstrated that the Prototype has the communication speeds, communication reliability, and computed processing speed to support speed harmonization application functionality in an operational traffic environment.

30|$|Nanomaterial-delivered {{fabrication}} [1 - 7] is {{a critical}} step toward realization of molecular architecture/electronics and nano-bio material engineering. Among conventional technologies, it corresponds to the additive nanofabrication method, representing a bottom up approach for nanostructures and nanodevices, which deposits materials onto a substrate. Such additive methods can be classified into two categories: beam-based writing [8, 9] and pen-type lithography [10, 11]. The direct laser writing is a typical beam-based lithography method and {{has the advantage of}} a fast <b>prototyping</b> <b>speed,</b> but it cannot be used to deposit beam-inactive materials. The electron-beam-based and the focused-ion-beam-based lithography allow high-resolution fabrication of various nanomaterials but the required high particle energy and long writing time limit their applications to nanodevice fabrication. On the other hand, the pen-type nanofabrication method such as the dip-pen nanolithography exhibits the advantages of higher throughput and lower energy consumption than the beam-based methods along with previous contributions of nano-dispensing [12 - 15] and scanning probe lithography methods [16 - 18]. However, it also suffers from both lack of continuous writing capability and limited ink selectivity. Recently, the meniscus-confined electrodeposition of electrolytes has been developed for fabrication of metallic structures, but its application is restricted to the conducting substrate because it employs the electric field-induced delivery [19].|$|R
