50|$|Parallel to his {{initiatives}} in Air Force education and training, Hewitt introduced a revised aircrew ranking scheme {{that consisted of}} skill categories with various levels, such as navigator level 4 or <b>pilot</b> <b>level</b> 1, rather than the regular military ranks such as sergeant or flight lieutenant. This was abandoned in 1950 due to dissatisfaction caused {{by the lack of}} obvious equivalence between these specialist 'ranks' and the traditional ranking system common {{to the rest of the}} RAAF and other defence forces. After completing his term as Air Member for Personnel in 1948, he was posted to London as the Australian Defence Representative. By now promoted air vice marshal, Hewitt was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1951 New Year Honours. Returning from Britain the same year, he took over as Air Member for Supply and Equipment (AMSE) from Air Vice Marshal George Mackinolty, who had died suddenly of cancer. Hewitt served as AMSE until his retirement from the RAAF in April 1956. In this role, he again cooperated with Air Vice Marshal Wackett—now the Air Member for Technical Services—to introduce the concept of acquiring spare parts based on 'life-of-type', whereby the forecast number and type of spares necessary for an aircraft's projected service life would be ordered when it was first deployed operationally, to reduce support costs and delivery times.|$|E

50|$|Shortly after ignition, {{at about}} 60,000 feet (18 km), the craft {{unexpectedly}} rolled 90 {{degrees to the}} left, due to wind shear. When the pilot attempted to correct it, it rolled 90 degrees to the right. The <b>pilot</b> <b>levelled</b> the craft out, and proceeded with the climb. The correction of the roll excursion, using full trim, caused a pitch trim tab to run up against a stop. This caused the trim actuator, as designed, to stop operating for a 3 s timeout. Not realising what had happened, the pilot and controllers interpreted this as failure of the trim actuator, and they switched to a backup system. Spacecraft attitude was problematic during the entire climb, and not corrected until the start of re-entry.|$|R

40|$|In {{the event}} of an aircraft’s cyclic Active Inceptor System(AIS) failure, causing sudden loss of {{actively}} generated control forces, its flight control mechanical characteristics (FCMC) would degrade to the system’s inherent, nearzero force characteristics (the isotonic mode).

In order to mitigate the risks associated with this failure and to optimise the inherent FCMC and augmentation laws for improved handling qualities (HQ), a standardised and generic test that incorporated all influencing worst case flight and control parameters needed to be defined. The data from simulator evaluations were analysed and it was concluded that the most influencing parameters on the severity of transient response and recovery were the steady inceptor force and the <b>pilot's</b> <b>level</b> of attentiveness at the point of failure.

Effective August 1, 2013, all airline pilots must have an Airline Transport Pilot Certificate (ATP) or an Airline Transport Pilot Certificate with restricted Privileges (ATP-r). An ATP allows a pilot to act as the Captain or First Officer of an airline flight and requires 1,500 hours of total flight time as well as other requirements (i.e. 25 hours of night, 23 years old), see 14CFR61.159. An ATP-r certificate allows a pilot to act as a First Officer in a two pilot crew if they do not meet certain requirements. For example, the total flight time requirement is reduced to as little as 750 hours and the age requirement is reduced to 21. see 14CFR61.160.|$|R

50|$|Changing a person’s {{orientation}} {{will cause}} specific ducts to be stimulated due to these hair cells. When the head turns, the canals move {{but because of}} its inertia, the endolymph fluid tends to lag and thereby stimulates the hair cells. This stimulation results in awareness of angular acceleration in that plane. After about 10 seconds the endolymph velocity matches that of the canal, which stops stimulation of the hair cells and reduces the person's awareness of rotation. In addition, the canals cannot detect rotational acceleration of approximately 1 degree per second squared or lower; this is the detection threshold of the semicircular canals.Therefore, a pilot may not notice a slow turn or a bank maintained long enough. After the <b>pilot</b> <b>levels</b> the wings, there is an illusion that the plane is banking {{too much in the}} opposite direction.
