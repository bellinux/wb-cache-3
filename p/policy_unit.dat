Pan-democrat legislator Albert Chan gave his nomination to Tsang in the Chief Executive election, while Albert Cheng was seen as Tsang's friend in the Legislative Council. Tsang also appointed some members from the pan-democracy camp to the government positions, including Lau Sai-leung to the Central <b>Policy</b> <b>Unit</b> which drew the criticism from the traditional Beijing-loyalists. On 30 August 2005, Tsang announced that the Guangdong Provincial Government invited all 60 members from the legislative council to visit Guangdong between 25 to 26 September 2005.

To augment timely and effective analysis of the revenue aspects of the fiscal policy, governments have increasingly turned toward in-house tax <b>policy</b> <b>units</b> {{rather than relying on}} tax experts from outside their countries. These tax <b>policy</b> <b>units</b> have been increasingly called upon to analyze the impact of tax policies on the economy and to estimate the revenue implications of tax measures, with the ultimate objective of ensuring a healthy fiscal situation within the economy. Tax <b>policy</b> <b>units</b> also help ensure that tax systems are efficient, fair, and simple to understand and comply with.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of <b>policy</b> <b>units</b> at key corporate actors of the British and the German core executive reveals different patterns. The paper argues that characteristic {{features of the}} politico-administrative system, e. g. the number and allocation of veto points, {{the separation of powers}} and the administrative culture determine the institutionalisation of such units. Moreover, whether and how these units contribute to coherent government policy-making depends largely on their innovative capacity to complement traditional mechanisms of cross-departmental co-ordination with new instruments and ways of policy-making which again ensure their involvement and enhance their influence.

25|$|Following the {{abolition}} of the GLC, McDonnell was employed as head of the <b>policy</b> <b>unit</b> at Camden London Borough Council. In 1987, he became Chief Executive of the Association of London Authorities (eventually the Association of London Government), where he represented all the London Boroughs in their relations with central government and Europe. Having previously unsuccessfully contested Hampstead and Highgate in 1983, McDonnell fought for his home constituency of Hayes and Harlington at the 1992 general election, but was narrowly defeated by the Conservative incumbent Terry Dicks, by a mere 53 votes. During the campaign, his Conservative opponent Terry Dicks sued for libel over critical material in McDonnell's campaign leaflets; McDonnell settled and paid Dicks £15,000 plus legal costs, which amounted to £55,000.|$|E
25|$|Born in Liverpool, McDonnell {{moved with}} his family to the south of England when he was very young; his father became a bus driver and was a branch {{secretary}} of the Transport and General Workers' Union. McDonnell attended Great Yarmouth Grammar School. McDonnell began training to be a Catholic priest, attending St Joseph's College, Ipswich, a Roman Catholic boarding independent school for boys (now co-educational), before eventually deciding against the vocation. Upon leaving education, he held a series of unskilled jobs. After marrying his first wife, he studied for A-levels at night school at Burnley Technical College, and at the age of 23, he moved to Hayes in Greater London, attended Brunel University, and took a Bachelor of Science degree in Government and Politics. During this period, he helped his wife run a small children's home in Hayes, and was active on behalf of his local community and for National Union of Public Employees. After completing his Master of Science in Politics and Sociology at Birkbeck College, University of London, he became a researcher and official with the National Union of Mineworkers from 1977–78, and later the Trades Union Congress from 1978–82. From 1985–87, he was head of the <b>Policy</b> <b>Unit</b> at Camden Borough Council, then chief executive of the Association of London Authorities from 1987–95 and the Association of London Government from 1995–97.|$|E
