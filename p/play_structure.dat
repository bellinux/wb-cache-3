5|$|The former SeaWorld site {{began to}} be {{demolished}} in late 2004, when Geauga Lake started construction on a new water park. On November 11, 2004 Geauga Lake announced Wildwater Kingdom, a new water park {{scheduled to open in}} 2005. It would be constructed in two phases, with the first phase costing $16million and the second phase $8million. The first phase consisted of a ProSlide Tornado, an activity pool, an action river and a new children's area with a multistory <b>play</b> <b>structure.</b> Hurricane Mountain, Ohio's tallest water-slide complex, was moved from the existing water park to the new Wildwater Kingdom and renamed Thunder Falls. Together, they formed Geauga Lake & Wildwater Kingdom. The parks were connected by a floating bridge {{in the middle of the}} lake.|$|E

500|$|In June 2009, an {{unidentified}} arsonist destroyed the center. According to Schuurman, the center suffered three arson attempts previously: a fire burned the professional building three months prior and {{was followed by}} the discovery of a soda can filled with flammable liquid, then the burning down of the center's <b>play</b> <b>structure.</b> Building and content losses were estimated at $750,000. Business and financial records, as well as program materials were lost in the fire. The organization spent a year attempting to recover a [...] "fair" [...] insurance settlement, during which the building remained vacant and was subjected to vandalism (stolen copper pipes resulted in a flooded basement). Deconstruction and demolition of the building began in May 2010, following receipt of a $1.2 million settlement. During the construction of the new center, which began in April 2012, the center operated on Northeast Glisan Street near 22nd Avenue in Northeast Portland and reportedly never cancelled a single support meeting.|$|E

500|$|To {{the west}} of the {{building}} is Willson Park, named for Salem founder William H. Willson and sited roughly at the center of his former landholdings. From 1853 to 1965 it was a Salem city park. After the park was turned over to the state, Lloyd Bond and Associates were asked to redesign the park. Willson Park has the Waite Fountain, a gazebo built in 1982, and Peter Helzer's sculpture, Parade of Animals (1991), which was designed as a <b>play</b> <b>structure.</b> [...] Waite Fountain was donated in honor of Oregon businessperson E. M. Waite in 1907 by his wife. The Breyman Fountain, added in 1904 as a memorial to Werner and Eugene Breyman, is at the far west end of the park. It was originally decorated with a statue of a soldier from the Spanish–American War and also served as a lamp post and horse trough. Today the statue holds no water and is sometimes planted with flowers. In 2005, a Walk of Flags feature was added that displays the flags of every state in the Union. In 2009, the nine flags of Oregon's federally recognized Native American tribes were added to the Walk of Flags.|$|E
500|$|Three family-oriented attractions {{are located}} on the ground level, {{detached}} from the three slide towers. Two of these are children's areas {{and the third is}} a wave pool. Pipeline Plunge is a children's area with four flume slides and hundreds of water activities. The area, originally called Nickelodeon's Pipeline Plunge, is a large, multi-level water <b>play</b> <b>structure</b> featuring an [...] tipping bucket which dumps water on guests every few minutes. It played host to two [...] "Slime Fest" [...] events in 2009 that included several live shows, a dunking chair and [...] "Australia's biggest sliming" [...] where [...] of slime was dumped on park guests using green coloured water in the giant tipping bucket twice daily. The mass sliming returned in the 2010/2011 summer holidays as part of the Summer Funomenon. Pipeline Plunge is a WhiteWater West Aqua Play area.

500|$|During development, {{the team}} faced {{a lot of}} {{problems}} when designing the game so it would be both familiar for series fans and fresh to old and new players. The pieces of gameplay experimentation meant that the development was [...] "a more fundamental ground-up process" [...] than earlier titles such as The Wind Waker. Their earlier titles had involved lifting elements from earlier games and pasting them into a new entry, but for Skyward Sword the developers wanted to add a new <b>play</b> <b>structure</b> to avoid fans seeing it as more of the same. The original concept for gameplay using the Wii MotionPlus was proposed by Fujibayashi at a point when the team were already developing the gameplay around the console's standard Wii Remote and Nunchuk control scheme. When first proposed, Aonuma was highly enthusiastic, and his wish to change to Wii MotionPlus meant that work on the game needed to begin all over again. The use of Wii MotionPlus proved challenging for the developers to implement, to the point where at one point Aonuma seriously considered dropping it from the game entirely. After the release of Wii Sports Resort, the team saw how motion controls could be used for swordplay: after talking with the development team, they were able to borrow the technology and used it to create the motion-driven swordplay. The implementation of Wii MotionPlus meant that the enemy artificial intelligence needed to be able to counter it, adjusting their stances depending on the position of Link's sword.|$|E

40|$|Naturalistic {{observations}} {{were made on}} 72 preschoolers in four daycare centres to determine whether preschoolers preferred {{certain areas of the}} playground and whether specific social and cognitive behaviors were localized in particular parts of the playground. Each playground area was classified in one of four ways (enclosed/private areas, <b>play</b> <b>structures,</b> pavement, and sand) to determine whether different areas elicit different behaviors. Whether individual differences in internalizing or externalizing behaviors or sex influenced amount of time spent in different types of areas or number of areas played in were also examined. Results indicated that preschoolers spent more time on pavement and sand than on <b>play</b> <b>structures</b> and private areas and that there was more unoccupied activity in the former two areas than in the latter. Sand appeared to promote fine motor <b>play</b> whereas <b>play</b> <b>structures</b> promoted gross motor play.

40|$|Background: Chromated {{copper arsenate}} (CCA) -treated wood {{has been widely}} used for outdoor <b>play</b> <b>structures.</b> There is a growing {{scientific}} concern about children’s exposure to the arsenic that leaches from these structures. The {{purpose of this study}} was to measure arsenic from CCA-treated wood <b>play</b> <b>structures</b> owned by the City of Toronto to guide an appropriate exposure reduction strategy. Methods: In the fall of 2002, 4 soil and 2 wood surface samples (dislodgeable arsenic) were collected from 217 <b>play</b> <b>structures</b> and analyzed for total arsenic content. Soil arsenic concentrations were compared to the federal soil guideline of 12 µg/g. Dislodgeable arsenic concentrations were compared to a Toronto Public Health-derived interim action level of 100 µg/ 100 cm 2. Results: Soil arsenic levels in samples taken from within one metre of CCA-treated wood were low (mean 2. 1; range 0. 5 - 10 µg/g). However, the means of the arsenic level in the composite soil samples taken from beneath an elevated platform were significantly greater (p< 0. 01) than the background soil sample and soil from within one metre of the CCA...|$|R
