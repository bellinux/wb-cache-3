50|$|Seifert had crafted all of {{his weapons}} about two {{months prior to the}} attack. The lance was made from a broomstick and a {{triangular}} scraper, while he used a <b>pump</b> <b>bracket</b> to create the mace. His flamethrower was made from an insecticide sprayer with a wire netting attached to the nozzle, and filled with a mixture of old motor oil and paint thinner.|$|E
5000|$|The journey {{had started}} off well, but very quickly the bad weather {{and a number}} of {{mechanical}} problems significantly reduced the speed of the ship. Afterwards, the left engine ceased operating for 20 hours and 26 minutes, shortly followed by the right engine, which stopped running for 11 hours and 42 minutes. Fortunately for the passengers and the crew, the engines halted separately, not simultaneously. The cause of mechanical problems was later considered by ship specialists to be overheating of bearings or as it was formally stated in The Marine Engineer Magazine [...] "the failure of the slide valves to work smoothly and to the breakage of studs on the air <b>pump</b> <b>brackets,</b> so that a proper vacuum could not be maintained".|$|R
50|$|The pumps on {{fire trucks}} don’t help if there’s not a skilled person {{operating}} the controls. This race pits teams {{against the clock}} {{to see who can}} get a steady stream of water to the deluge gun (on the end of the hose) the quickest.The operator starts 10 feet from the pumper without the pump in gear, the operator must engage the pump, and pull a draft and have a working stream quickly. The fastest time for this event wins, judging is usually broken up in classes for centrifugal, piston, and rotary gear pumps. Another variant is <b>Bracket</b> <b>pumping</b> where the operator guesses {{how long it will take}} him to perform the same tasks, his score is the difference in seconds from his guess to his actual.|$|R
