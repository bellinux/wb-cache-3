50|$|Wickwane's {{background}} is unknown, {{as is his}} place of education, but he {{was referred to as}} magister so he probably attended a university. He was prebendary of North Newald in Yorkshire by 1265 and also held the prebend of Ripon. He was elected Archbishop of York on 22 June 1279, and consecrated on 17 September 1279 by Pope Nicholas III at Viterbo. On his return to England, he had his <b>primatial</b> <b>cross</b> carried in front of him through the see of Canterbury, thus reviving a centuries-old controversy between York and Canterbury. He was enthroned at York Minster on Christmas Day 1279. The matter of the cross involved Wickwane in a dispute with Archbishop John Peckham of Canterbury.|$|E
5000|$|In the Anglican Communion, archbishops are styled [...] "The Most Reverend" [...] and {{addressed}} as [...] "Your Grace", while bishops are styled [...] "The Right Reverend" [...] {{and addressed}} as [...] "My Lord" [...] or [...] "Your Lordship". (In some countries, this usage is followed {{also by the}} Roman Catholic Church, but in others no distinction is made and [...] "The Most Reverend" [...] and [...] "Your Excellency" [...] are used for archbishops and bishops alike.) Anglican archbishops are entitled to be preceded by a server carrying an archiepiscopal processional cross (with two bars instead of one) in liturgical processions. The Archbishop of Canterbury's metropolitical processional cross is always carried before him by a priest-chaplain, and (like other archbishops) is a two-barred processional cross. However, the Archbishop of Canterbury is also entitled to be preceded by the ancient <b>primatial</b> <b>cross</b> of Canterbury (still in ceremonial use) which is of an ornate historical design, made of precious metal, and with precious stones inserted, but unlike his metropolitical cross (or those of other archbishops) it is not double-barred.|$|E
