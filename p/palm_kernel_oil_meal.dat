Methods: Nonionic surfactant blends of Tween&reg; and Tween&reg;/Span&reg; series were screened based on their solubilization capacity with water for <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>oil</b> esters. Tween&reg; 80 and five blends of Tween&reg; 80 /Span&reg; 80 and Tween&reg; 80 /Span&reg; 85 in the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) value range of 10. 7 &ndash; 14. 0 were selected to study the phase diagram behavior of <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>oil</b> esters using the water titration method at room temperature. Results: High solubilization capacity was obtained by Tween&reg; 80 compared with other surfactants of Tween&reg; series. High HLB blends of Tween&reg; 80 /Span&reg; 85 and Tween&reg; 80 /Span&reg; 80 at HLB 13. 7 and 13. 9, respectively, have better solubilization capacity compared with the lower HLB values of Tween&reg; 80 /Span&reg; 80. All the selected blends of surfactants were formed as water-in-oil microemulsions, and other dispersion systems varied in size and geometrical layout in the triangles. The high solubilization capacity and larger areas of the water-in-oil microemulsion systems were due to the structural similarity between the lipophilic tail of Tween&reg; 80 and the oleyl group of the <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>oil</b> esters. Conclusion: This study suggests that the phase diagram behavior of <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>oil</b> esters, water, and nonionic surfactants is not only affected by the HLB value, but also by the structural similarity between <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>oil</b> esters and the surfactant used.

Palm oil is obtained from the mesocarp of the palm fruit while <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>oil</b> {{is derived from the}} flesh of the kernel. Although they come from the same fruit, <b>palm</b> <b>oil</b> and <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>oil</b> differ in their physical and chemical characteristics. Palm oil is about 50 % saturated and contains mainly palmitic (Ci 6 : 0) and oleic (Ci 8 :i) acids. <b>Palm</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>oil</b> is more than 80 % saturated and contains mainly lauric acid (C 12 : 0). Fractionation process separates palm oil into palm olein (liquid) and palm stearin (solid). A second fractionation gives superolein, palm mid fraction and hard stearin. Similarly fractionation separates <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>oil</b> into <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> olein and <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> stearin. <b>Palm</b> <b>oil</b> and palm olein are widely used for industrial frying of snack foods due to their excellent oxidative stability. They have a long shelf life due to the presence of vitamin E, a powerful natural antioxi­dant. Palm olein produces less smoking, spattering, foaming and gums compared to polyunsaturated oils such as soyabean and sunflower oils. Palm stearin is used as an ingredient (hard feed stock) in the manufacture of shortenings, margarines and vanaspati. Being naturally semi-solid, it is an excellent choice for the manufacture of semi-solid products such as shortenings, margarines and vanaspati since it can reduce cost and is free form trans fatty acids. Palm oil stabilizes the product in β' form, which is required for good creaming and baking performances. <b>Palm</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>oil</b> and its products, either on its own or in combination with palm oil products are widely used in the manufacture of specialty fats, margarines and spreads. Incorporation of <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>oil</b> or its derivatives, particularly in table margarine and spreads improves melting characteristic of the products. <b>Palm</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>oil</b> can be used to some extent in shortenings and vanaspati. <b>Palm</b> <b>oil</b> and <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>oil</b> are also used in the manufacture of imitation dairy products.

Future outlook sees new applications of palm oil in pourable margarines, burgers, frankfurters and sausage/bologna. Substitution of animal fat with palm oil will give a low cholesterol meat product.

This is because of palm <b>oil</b> (PO) and <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>oil</b> (PKO) as raw material have important fatty acids involved in soap making which are C 16 -C 18 and C 12 -C 14 which contribute to the detergency properties, lathering and washing properties of the soaps. Parameters that involve in this research are ratio concentration of raw materials, temperature and speed. For the concentration, the ratio is from 0 until 100 %, for the temperature the best range is from 20 ˚C- 70 ˚C, for the speed the best range is from 600 - 1500 rpm, and within constant the time of process which is 30 min. This experiment consists only one process which is reactions process. First step is the temperature, speed and time of raw material are set as stated in the table. Second step is <b>palm</b> <b>oil</b> and <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>oil</b> are mixed together on the hot plate. Then the sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is added gradually together with the sodium chloride (NaCl) and EDTA based on the amount stated in table. The study has shown that the relationship of all parameter with optimum condition is achieved in order to produce high yield production of soap and in good quality compared with the production of soap from tallow and coconut oil. The optimum concentration in manufacturing of soap is making from a blend of 80 % <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> and 20 % palm oil with the speed 900 rpm at temperature 30 ˚ C...|$|R
