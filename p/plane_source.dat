50|$|The Transient <b>Plane</b> <b>Source</b> {{technique}} typically employs {{two samples}} halves, in-between which the sensor is sandwiched. Normally the samples should be homogeneous, but extended use of transient <b>plane</b> <b>source</b> testing of heterogeneous material is possible, with proper selection of sensor size to maximize sample penetration. This method {{can also be}} used in a single-sided configuration, with the introduction of a known insulation material used as sensor support.|$|E
50|$|A {{variation}} of the above method is the Modified Transient <b>Plane</b> <b>Source</b> Method (MTPS) developed by Dr. Nancy Mathis. The device uses a one-sided, interfacial, heat reflectance sensor that applies a momentary, constant heat source to the sample. The difference between this method and traditional transient <b>plane</b> <b>source</b> technique described above is that the heating element is supported on a backing, which provides mechanical support, electrical insulation and thermal insulation. This modification provides a one-sided interfacial measurement in offering maximum flexibility in testing liquids, powders, pastes and solids.|$|E

50|$|Transient <b>Plane</b> <b>Source</b> Method, {{utilizing}} a plane sensor {{and a special}} mathematical model describing the heat conductivity, combined with electronics, enables the method {{to be used to}} measure Thermal Transport Properties. It covers a thermal conductivity range of at least 0.01-500 W/m/K (in accordance with ISO 22007-2) and can be used for measuring various kinds of materials, such as solids, liquid, paste and thin films etc. In 2008 it was approved as an ISO-standard for measuring thermal transport properties of polymers (November 2008). This TPS standard also covers the use of this method to test both isotropic and anisotropic materials.|$|E

40|$|We present {{here the}} results of {{the first part of the}} VLBI Ecliptic Plane Survey (VEPS) program. The goal of the program is to find all compact sources within 7. 5 ^∘ of the {{ecliptic}} plane which are suitable as calibrators for anticipated phase referencing observations of spacecraft and determine their positions with accuracy at the 1. 5 nrad level. We run the program in two modes: the search mode and the refining mode. In the search mode, a complete sample of all sources brighter than 50 mJy at 5 GHz listed in the Parkes-MIT-NRAO (PMN) and Green Bank 6 cm (GB 6) catalogs, except those previously detected with VLBI, is observed. In the refining mode, the positions of all ecliptic <b>plane</b> <b>sources,</b> including those found in the search mode, are improved. By October 2016, thirteen 24 -hr sessions that targeted all sources brighter than 100 mJy have been observed and analyzed. Among 3320 observed target sources, 555 objects have been detected. We also conducted a number of follow-up VLBI experiments in the refining mode and improved the positions of 249 ecliptic <b>plane</b> <b>sources.</b> Comment: 12 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables, accepted by The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series (ApJS...|$|R

40|$|A {{comparative}} analysis of two planar near-field (NF) to far-field (FF) computation methods is proposed. The first method {{is based on}} the plane wave spectrum (PWS). The other method is the Planar Scanning Area Extrapolation Method (PSAEM). This method {{is based on the}} introduction of auxiliary dipoles mimicking the radiation of a real <b>source</b> in the <b>plane</b> outside the scan area. The accuracy of both methods was tested with EM radiation from a set of elementary electric dipoles radiating at 1 GHz and the radiation of a planar textile antenna at 2. 5 GHz. Comparisons of NF cartographies at different test <b>planes</b> above the <b>source</b> <b>plane</b> with the reference data were made. It was shown that the PWS method presents an error vector magnitude increasing with the distance between the observation <b>plane</b> and the <b>source</b> <b>plane</b> position.
