40|$|Current work at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) {{is focused}} on the {{development}} CERMET fuel materials for Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP). The CERMETs consist of uranium dioxide (UO 2) fuel particles embedded in a tungsten (W) metal matrix. Initial testing of W-UO 2 samples fabricated from fine angular powders performed reasonably well, but suffered from significant fuel loss during repeated thermal cycling due to agglomeration of the UO 2 (1). The blended powder mixtures resulted in a non-uniform dispersion of the UO 2 particles in the tungsten matrix, which allows rapid vaporization of the interconnected UO 2 from the sample edges into the bulk material. Also, the angular powders create areas of stress concentrations due to thermal expansion mismatch, which eventually cracks the tungsten matrix. Evenly coating spherical UO 2 particles with chemical vapor deposited (CVD) tungsten prior to consolidation was previously demonstrated to provide improved performance. However, the CVD processing technology is expensive and not currently available. In order to reduce cost and enhance performance, a powder coating process has been developed at MSFC to produce a uniform distribution of the spherical UO 2 particles in a tungsten matrix. The method involves utilization of a polyethylene binder during mixing which leads to fine tungsten powders clinging to the larger UO 2 spherical particles. This process was developed using HfO 2 as a surrogate for UO 2. Enough powder was mixed to make 8 discs (2 cm diameter x 8 mm thickness) using spark plasma sintering. A uniaxial pressure of 50 MPa was used at four different temperatures (2 samples at each temperature). The first two samples were heated to 1400 C and 1500 C respectively for 5 minutes. Densities for these samples were less than 85 % of theoretical, so the time at temperature was increased to 20 minutes for the remaining samples. The highest densities were achieved for the two samples sintered at 1700 C (approx. 92 % of theoretical). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the mixed powders and the sintered samples along with energy dispersive x-ray analysis was obtained. The SEM of the powders clearly show the fine W powder adhered to the larger HfO 2 particles and a uniform distribution of HfO 2 particles in a tungsten matrix upon densification. Vicker's Microhardness testing was also performed on all samples using 0. 5, 1. 0 and 2. 0 kg loads. Five indents were made at each load level. All indents were placed in the tungsten matrix to assist as a proxy in measuring densification. The highest hardness value was obtained for the 1700 C specimens. The hardness average for these samples was 312. 14 MPa.

Similar size is obtained in our <b>powders.</b> TEM <b>images</b> show sizes of nanocrystals between 2 to 6  nm, and in our results, the size of C-Si-ncs is between 4 and 6  nm. On the other hand, with respect to FTIR, several groups with silicon oxide, silicon-hydrogen, and carbon-hydrogen bonds were obtained. Their PL spectra have some resemblance with ours because they also had double peaks of photoluminescence in the red region. Similar behavior is obtained in the UV–vis spectra. The bandgap was calculated using the same method, with energies of the same order as our results. This demonstrates that there is a method simpler to get results like that of Ray et al. [47]. Regarding the working life of the colloidal solutions, our samples were synthesized more than 6  months ago and are still presenting the same intense photoluminescence. Even when the solvent evaporates, depositing the same solvent would result to the same PL.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{demonstrate}} a novel method of extracting relevant information from undispersed bulk powder surfaces to be used in particle size analysis. A new surface imaging approach for undispersed powders combined with multivariate modeling was used. Digital surface images of various granule batches were captured using an inventive optical setup in controlled illumination conditions. A descriptor, the gray scale difference matrix (GSDM), which describes the particle size of granular material was generated and extracted from the <b>powder</b> surface <b>image</b> information. Partial least squares (PLS) modeling was used to create a model between the GSDM and the particle size distribution of granules measured with sieving. The use of lateral illumination and the combining of information from 2 surface images strengthened the shading effects on the powder surfaces. The shading effects exposed the topography or the visual texture of the powder surfaces. This textural information was efficiently extracted using the GSDM descriptor. The goodness-of-fit (R 2) for the created PLS model was 0. 91 and the predicted variation (Q 2) was 0. 87, indicating a good model. The model covered granule sizes in the size range of approximately 20 to 2500 μm. The extracted descriptor was effectively used in particle size measurement. This study confirms that digital images taken from undispersed bulk powder surfaces contain substantial information needed for particle size distribution analysis.

During the immersion the surface was analysed in-situ using synchrotron X-ray diffraction on the UK CRG beamline XMaS (BM 28) [16] at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). Surface powder diffractograms were collected for 2  s every 125  s using a Mar CCD 165 camera (Mar, USA, Inc.). The sample surface was automatically moved to within 125  μm of an X-ray transparent, 6  μm thick, Kapton® window for 10  s for x-ray exposure {{and then moved}} deeper into the solution to ensure unrestricted growth. It then remained immersed at all times. After 10  hours, the window was removed and the surface allowed to dry until no further changes occurred in the diffraction patterns. (b) In a different experiment conducted on the Belgian-Dutch CRG beamline DUBBLE (BM 26 a) at the ESRF, the same solution was flowed in 2  mL droplets across a polished lead sample surface in ambient air.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop a {{computer}} model to simulate the image acquisition for two computed radiography (CR) imaging systems used for neonatal chest imaging: (1) The Agfa ADC Compact, a flying spot reader with <b>powder</b> phosphor <b>image</b> plates (MD 40. 0); and (2) the Agfa DX-S, a line-scanning CR reader with needle crystal phosphor image plates (HD 5. 0). The model was then applied to compare the image quality of the two CR imaging systems. METHODS: Monte Carlo techniques were used to simulate the transport of primary and scattered x rays in digital x-ray systems. The output of the Monte Carlo program was an image representing the energy absorbed in the detector material. This image was then modified using physical characteristics of the CR imaging systems to account for the signal intensity variations due to the heel effect along the anode-cathode axis, the spatial resolution characteristics of the imaging system, and the various sources of image noise. The simulation was performed for typical acquisition parameters of neonatal chest x-ray examinations. To evaluate the computer model, the authors compared the threshold-contrast detectability in simulated and experimentally acquired images of a contrast-detail phantom. Threshold-contrast curves were computed using a commercially available scoring program. RESULTS: The threshold-contrast curves of the simulated and experimentally acquired images show good agreement; for the two CR systems, 93 % of the threshold diameters calculated from the simulated images fell within the confidence intervals of the threshold diameter calculated from the experimentally assessed images. Moreover, the superiority of needle based CR plates for neonatal imaging was confirmed.

30|$|The gas sensing {{mechanism}} for the composite sensors may be explained {{on the basis of}} interactions between the sensing film and adsorbed gas. For pure P 3 HT, it has been proposed that NH 3 can adsorb and donate a lone pair of its electrons to the pentagonal sulfur ring in the P 3 HT structure[22]. Electrons will recombine with existing holes in the p-type P 3 HT, leading to a resistance increase in agreement with the observed NH 3 response. By adding unloaded ZnO NPs, the response is enhanced by a factor of approximately 1.5. This could reasonably be explained by the increase of specific surface area for gas interaction of the composite film by ZnO NPs. From the FE-SEM image in Figure  5, ZnO NP addition results in considerable increase of film porosity and hence the surface area. However, the magnitude of this increase cannot be quantitatively confirmed as BET measurement, which is currently the only quantitative analysis method of specific surface area, of the film surface is presently not available because the standard BET method requires a large amount of material (> 0.3  g) which is difficult to prepare in the form of film and the presence of substrate will considerably complicate nitrogen adsorption evaluation. Thus, the specific surface area of the composite film can only be inferred from BET data of the corresponding <b>powder</b> and SEM <b>images.</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} essentially {{consists of}} three related studies concerned with quantifying the structure and micromechanical state of bulk polycrystalline materials. They are contained in Chapters 1, 2 and 3, which may be read independently. The {{emphasis is on the}} development of new methods for the analysis and interpretation of generalized pole figure data. Chapter 1 contains an expanded version of a manuscript my coauthors and I have submitted for review [3]. In it, a robust method for obtaining an orientation distribu- tion function (ODF) from pole density functions (PDFs) is presented. The method uses the gradient norm of the ODF for conditional control of the solution {{in the context of a}} constrained minimization problem. The introduction has been expanded to include a detailed definition of the ODF and PDF. Several additional sample applications of the method have also been included, as well as several appendices that elaborate on the mathematical formalism of orientations and other technical aspects of the implementation. Chapter 2 is largely similar to a second manuscript that has been provisionally accepted for publication in the Journal of Applied Crystallography [5]. In it, the methods developed in Chapter 1 have been adapted to obtain a lattice strain distribution function (LSDF) from strain pole figures (SPFs). The proposed SPF inversion method utilizes conditional control formulated independently of any kinematic linking assumptions. In Chapter 3, a methodology is presented for extracting generalized pole figure data from 2 -d <b>powder</b> diffraction <b>images.</b> An example application of this analysis, along with the methods presented in Chapters 1 and 2, is provided using data obtained via an in situ loading/diffraction experiment performed at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source. The fourth and final chapter provides a summary of the salient scientific contributions of this dissertation, along with proposed extensions of the research. Together, the 3 methods presented in this dissertation provide a set of tools for characterizing the structure and micro-mechanical state of polycrystalline materials at the bulk scale. Most importantly, the resulting distributions are suitable for direct comparison to the predictions of structure-based models of polycrystalline materials.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{developing}} a novel material delivery device for a Multiple Material Additive Manufacturing (MMAM) system using a Dry Powder Printing (DPP) technique developed recently. The {{goal of the}} thesis was to study in detail the characteristic of a micro dispensing device utilizing ultrasonic vibration via a piezoelectric transducer, which was designed and constructed to handle {{a wide range of}} fine powder materials. The research systematically investigated the nature of the interaction between the device and the materials, which allowed the design and processing parameters to be understood. Experiments were conducted to explain the effects of the printing parameters on printing results so as to discover the basic characteristics of the new dry powder printing device. Moreover, weight measurements of the deposited <b>powder,</b> microscopy and <b>image</b> visualization was used to assess the behavior of the device. The device developed can successfully provide continuity, consistency and reliability of layer printing of multiple material powders. The results demonstrated that the device is capable of dispensing various types of fine powders, such as metals, polymers and ceramics, with particle sizes of between 14 - 72 ?m. The relative standard deviation of the device is less than 7 %. The minimum mass flow rate can be reached at 0. 14 mg/s for a cohesive powder such as a copper powder. The maximum moving speed is up to 50 mm/s for a free flowing powder such as a solder powder. Currently, the precise printing of micro geometries can be achieved up to a diameter as small as 85 ?m. Moreover, the study also reveals that the performance of the device mainly depends on the dispensing parameters (e. g. nozzle diameter, nozzle angle, and piezo electric position), material parameters (e. g. type, particle size, flowability) and process parameters (e. g. moving speed, signal voltage and standoff distance). High resolution printing by the device can be achieved by controlling these parameters. This work has shown that the dispenser can deliver different powders in very precise and small quantities at almost any designated position. This demonstrates the potential of this method for a multiple material delivery system for MMAM in the near future...|$|R
40|$|The pore {{diameter}} of a catalyst support controls {{the diffusion of}} reactant molecules to the catalytic active sites; thus, affecting the rates and conversions of the hydrotreating reactions. Desirable textural properties of SBA- 15 makes it a potential alternative to the conventionally used &# 947;-Al 2 O 3 support {{due to the fact}} that its pore size can be manipulated via controlling the synthesis parameters, while maintaining relatively high surface area. Larger pore diameter SBA- 15 supports may facilitate the diffusion of bulky molecules as that of the asphaltenes present in the heavy petroleum fractions, making it a potential catalyst support for hydrotreating operations. Considering the very sour nature of Canada’s bitumen with high sulfur contents in the range of 2 - 6 wt %, the appreciably high sulfur contents particularly present in Athabasca derived heavy gas oils (about 4 wt % sulfur), the rising demand for cleaner fuels, and also the increasing stringency on environmental standards, the need for novel and improved hydrotreating catalysts cannot be overemphasized. By varying the molar ratio of hexane to ammonium fluoride, the pore channels of SBA- 15 could be varied. Controlling the pore {{diameter of}} these supports via micelle swelling facilitated the production of larger pore diameter SBA- 15 -supported catalysts. In this project, four mesoporous silica SBA- 15 catalyst supports with pore diameters in the range of 5 - 20 nm were synthesized in the preliminary phase using hexane as the micelle swelling agent and subsequently utilized for the loading of 2 wt. % Fe and 15 wt. % W catalyst metals, respectively. The hexagonal mesoscopic structure of these materials were characterized using powder small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, TEM and SEM <b>images.</b> <b>Powder</b> XRD analysis evidenced inhomogeneous metal dispersion on the largest pore diameter catalyst.

The optimum catalyst was found to be Cat-H with metal loadings of 3 wt. % Fe and 30 wt. % W. At these loadings and temperatures of 375 °C, 388 °C, and 400 °C, HDS activities of 53. 4 %, 64. 1 %, and 73. 3 % with corresponding HDN activities of 21. 9 %, 26. 2 %, and 38. 3 %, respectively, were recorded. Catalytic performance evaluations conducted on equal mass loading using a reference commercial &# 947;-Al 2 O 3 -supported FeW catalyst offered HDS activities of 69. 3 %, 80. 4 %, and 89. 1 %, with corresponding HDN activities of 16. 4 %, 32. 4 %, and 49. 3 % at the same temperatures studied. However, no significant changes in HDS and HDN activities were observed for similar evaluations on volume percent metals loading basis. Kinetic studies performed with the optimum FeW/SBA- 15 catalyst suggested activation energies of 147. 2 and 150. 6 kJ/mol for HDS and HDN, respectively, by the Langmuir-Hinshelwood’s model. Similar results were predicted by the Power Law and Multi-parameter models for HDS (129. 6 and 126. 7 kJ/mol, respectively), which does not conclusively make the latter model clearly stand out as the best. Data fitting by the Power Law suggested reaction orders of 2 and 1. 5 for HDS and HDN, which seem to be consistent for the hydrotreatment of heavy gas oil. Finally, a long-term deactivation study spanning a period of 60 days time-on-stream showed the optimum catalyst to be stable under hydrotreating experiments conducted in a downward flow micro-trickle bed reactor at temperature, pressure, liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV), and gas/oil ratio of 375 – 400 &# 730;C, 8. 8 MPa, 1 h- 1, and 600 mL/mL (at STP), respectively...|$|R
