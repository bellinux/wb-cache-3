Domesticated animals that were also eaten included chickens, Mandarin ducks, geese, cows, sheep, pigs, camels and dogs (various types were bred specifically for food, while most were used as pets). Turtles and fish were taken from streams and lakes. Commonly hunted game, such as owl, pheasant, magpie, sika deer, and Chinese bamboo partridge were consumed. Seasonings included sugar, honey, salt and soy sauce. Beer and wine were regularly consumed.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{agricultural}} food staples during Han were wheat, barley, rice, foxtail millet, <b>proso</b> <b>millet,</b> and beans. People of the Han also consumed sorghum, Job's tears, taro, mallow, mustard green, melon, bottle gourd, bamboo shoot, {{the roots of}} lotus plants, and ginger. Some of the fruits the Han ate included the chestnut, jujube, pear, peach, plum (including the plum of Prunus salicina and Prunus mume), melon, apricot, red bayberry, and strawberry. The Han Chinese domesticated and ate chickens, Mandarin ducks, geese, camels, cows, sheep, pigs, and dogs. The type of game animals hunted during the Han included rabbit, sika deer, turtle dove, goose, owl, Chinese bamboo partridge, magpie, common pheasant, and cranes, while fish and turtles were taken from streams and lakes. Beer—which could be an unfermented malt drink with low alcohol content or a stronger brew fermented with yeast—was commonly consumed alongside meat, but virtually never consumed alongside grains such as rice. Wine was also regularly consumed.|$|E

40|$|Seven millet {{varieties}} {{grown in}} Sri Lanka (proso, foxtail, finger (Ravi), finger (local), kodo, and little) and India (pearl) {{were used in}} this study. Soluble and bound phenolics obtained by solvent extraction were used to evaluate antioxidant, DNA scission and enzyme inhibitory and antiproliferative activities by several chemical and biological methods. Distribution of phenolics and their antioxidant activity was assessed in dehulled grains and hulls separated by air classification. Phenolic compounds in free, soluble conjugates and insoluble bound fractions were identified and quantified. In addition, accessibility of phenolics in the digestive tract was determined using a simulated in vitro digestion model and colonic fermentation. The contents of total phenolics (TPC),total flavonoids (TFC) and proanthocyanidins (PC) as well as scavenging activities of test compounds were evaluated using superoxide, hydroxyl, peroxyl, 2, 2 -diphenyl-l-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical, H₂O₂, and singlet oxygen. Different concentrations of extract {{were used to determine}} their IC₅₀ values. In addition, the ferrous chelating and reducing activities of extracts were measured. The highest phenolic content of soluble phenolics of millet grains was obtained with 70 % (v/v) acetone for 25 minutes under reflux conditions. The TPC of soluble and insoluble bound phenolic fractions of millet varieties were 7. 2 - 32. 4 and 2. 2 - 81. 6 μmol ferulic acid eq/g defatted meal, respectively. This demonstrates that bound phenolics are important contributors to antioxidant potential of millets. Kodo millet showed the highest soluble phenolic content followed by finger (local), finger (Ravi), little, foxtail, pearl and <b>proso</b> <b>millets.</b> Millets with dark brown pigmented testa and pericarp possessed a higher soluble phenolic content than those with white or yellow testa and pericarp. The TFC of soluble and insoluble extracts were 1. 2 - 33. 7 and 0. 3 - 4. 5 μmol catechin eq (CE) /g defatted meal, respectively. The soluble extracts of finger (local) millet had the highest PC (311. 28 μmol CE/g defatted meal). All varieties exhibited effective radical, H₂O₂ and singlet oxygen inhibition, reducing activity as well as ferrous ion chelating power which varied according to the assay employed and the variety used. Several hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acids and flavonoids were identified and quantified by HPLC analysis. In general, ferulic and ρ-coumaric were found to be the major phenolic acids followed by protocatechuic, caffeic, sinapic, ρ-hydroxybenzoic, gentisic, and vanillic acids and their contents depended on the variety and the form present in the grain matrix. Flavonoids identified were flavones, flavan- 3 -ol monomers and dimers, and flavanonols. All seven varieties effectively inhibited oxidation in a pork model system, and stripped corn oil. At a concentration of 0. 5 mg/ml all extracts inhibited oxidation by 16 - 88 % in the linoleic acid emulsion system. All phenolic extracts inhibited Cu (II) -induced human LDL and liposome oxidation and DNA scission. Millet extracts at 0. 05 mg/mL inhibited LDL cholesterol oxidation by 1 - 41 % and exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of DNA scission. The antiprolifeative studies showed that kodo millet extract inhibited HT- 29 cells proliferation in the range of 75 - 100 % after 4 days of incubation. The hulls from dehulled millets had higher TPC and antioxidant activity compared to their whole, dehulled and cooked grain counterparts. The phenolic extracts of dehulled millet grains, following in vitro enzymic digestion under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and colonic fermentation, showed effective antioxidant activity and were accessible under physiological conditions...|$|R
25|$|The Cucuteni-Trypillia {{culture was}} {{a society of}} {{subsistence}} farmers. Cultivating the soil (using an ard or scratch plough), harvesting crops and tending livestock was probably the main occupation for most people. Typically for a Neolithic culture, {{the vast majority of}} their diet consisted of cereal grains. They cultivated club wheat, oats, rye, <b>proso</b> <b>millet,</b> barley and hemp, which were probably ground and baked as unleavened bread in clay ovens or on heated stones in the home. They also grew peas and beans, apricot, cherry plum and wine grapes – though there is no solid evidence that they actually made wine. There is also evidence that they may have kept bees.|$|E
25|$|During the Middle Ages {{the cuisine}} of Poland was heavy and spicy. Two main {{ingredients}} were meat (both game and beef) and cereal. The latter consisted initially of <b>proso</b> <b>millet,</b> but {{later in the}} Middle Ages other types of cereal became widely used. Most commoners did not use bread and instead consumed cereals in the forms of kasza or various types of flatbread, some of which (for instance kołacz) are considered traditional recipes even in the 21st century. Apart from cereals, {{a large portion of}} the daily diet of mediaeval Poles consisted of beans, mostly broad beans and peas. As the territory of Poland was densely forested, usage of mushrooms, forest berries, nuts and wild honey was also widespread. Among the delicacies of the Polish nobility were honey-braised bear paws served with horseradish-flavoured salad (now species protected in Poland), smoked bear tongue and bear bacon.|$|E

50|$|While <b>proso</b> <b>millet</b> is not {{a member}} of the Neolithic Near East crop assemblage, it arrived in Europe no later than the time these {{introductions}} did, and <b>proso</b> <b>millet</b> as an independent domestication could predate the arrival of the Near East grain crops.|$|E
50|$|Due to its C4 {{photosynthetic}} system, <b>proso</b> <b>millet</b> is thermophilic like maize. Therefore, shady {{locations of}} the field should be avoided. It is sensitive to cold temperatures lower than 10 to 13 degrees Celsius. <b>Proso</b> <b>millet</b> is highly drought-resistant, which makes it of interest to regions with low water availability and longer periods without rain.The soil should be light or medium-heavy. Due to its flat root systems, soil compaction must be avoided. Furthermore, <b>proso</b> <b>millet</b> does not tolerate soil wetness caused by dammed-up water.|$|E

50|$|<b>Proso</b> <b>millet</b> is a {{relatively}} low-demanding crop and diseases are not known; consequently, <b>proso</b> <b>millet</b> is often used in organic farming systems in Europe. In the United States it is often used as an intercrop. Thus, <b>proso</b> <b>millet</b> can help to avoid a summer fallow, and continuous crop rotation can be achieved. Its superficial root system and its resistance to atrazine residue make <b>proso</b> <b>millet</b> a good intercrop between two water- and pesticide-demanding crops. The stubbles of the last crop, by allowing more heat into the soil, result in a faster and earlier millet growth. While millet occupies the ground, because of its superficial root system, the soil can replenish its water content for the next crop. Later crops, for example, a winter wheat, can in turn benefit from the millet stubble, which act as snow accumulators.|$|E

50|$|The {{most widely}} grown millet is pearl millet, {{which is an}} {{important}} sized crop in India and parts of Africa. Finger millet, <b>proso</b> <b>millet,</b> and foxtail millet are also important crop species. In the developed world, millets are less important. For example, in the United States the only significant crop is <b>proso</b> <b>millet,</b> which is mostly grown for bird seed.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} promote millet cultivation, other {{potential}} uses have been considered recently. For example, starch derived from millets {{has been shown to}} be a good substrate for fermentation and malting with grains having similar starch contents as wheat grains. A recently published study suggested that starch derived from <b>proso</b> <b>millet</b> can be converted to ethanol with an only moderately lower efficiency than starch derived from corn. The development of varieties with highly fermentable characteristics could improve ethanol yield to that of highly fermentable corn. Since <b>proso</b> <b>millet</b> is compatible with low-input agriculture, cultivation on marginal soils for biofuel production could represent an important new market, such as for farmers in the High Plains of the US.The demand for more diverse and healthier cereal-based foods is increasing, particularly in affluent countries. This could create new markets for <b>proso</b> <b>millet</b> products in human nutrition. Protein content in <b>proso</b> <b>millet</b> grains is comparable with that of wheat, but the share of essential amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and methionine) is substantially higher in <b>proso</b> <b>millet.</b> In addition, health-promoting phenolic compounds contained in the grains are readily bioaccessible and their high calcium content favor bone strengthening and dental health. Among the most commonly consumed products are ready-to-eat breakfast cereals made purely from millet flour [...] as well as a variety of noodles and bakery products, which are, however, often produced from mixtures with wheat flour to improve their sensory quality.|$|E

50|$|Only a few {{diseases}} and pests {{are known to}} attack <b>proso</b> <b>millet,</b> {{but they are not}} economically important. Weeds are a bigger problem. The critical phase is in juvenile development. The formation of the grains happens in the 3, up to 5, leaf stadium. After that, all nutrients should be available for the millet, so it is necessary to prevent the growth of weeds. In conventional farming, herbicides may be used. In organic farming it is possible to use harrow weeders and interrow cultivators, but special sowing parameters described in the chapter above are needed.For good crop development, fertilization with 50 to 75 kg nitrogen per hectare is recommended. Planting <b>proso</b> <b>millet</b> in a crop rotation after maize should be avoided due to its same weed spectrum. Because <b>proso</b> <b>millet</b> is an undemanding crop, it may be used {{at the end of the}} rotation.|$|E
