5|$|At Euston, major {{reconstruction}} {{works were}} undertaken {{to incorporate the}} new Victoria line <b>platforms</b> so that cross-platform interchanges could be provided with the Northern line's Bank branch—the former C route to King's Cross and Bank. Unlike the former CCE <b>platforms,</b> which were in separate tunnels with side <b>platforms,</b> the Bank branch tracks served an island platform in a single large tunnel. These <b>platforms</b> suffered from dangerous overcrowding at peak times. To provide cross-platform interchange, a new section of tunnel was constructed for northbound Bank branch trains, which were diverted to a new platform south of the original alignment. The redundant northbound track bed in the station tunnel was filled in to form a wider southbound platform. The new Victoria line <b>platforms</b> were excavated between and parallel to the original and the new Bank branch tunnels. Each pair of <b>platforms</b> was linked via a concourse served by escalators.|$|E
5|$|Entering {{the main}} building, the ticket office and ticket {{machines}} are immediately ahead, and the route from Temple Quay and the ferry {{is on the}} left; a bookshop is on the right, next to the platform entrance. Customer Information System screens by the entrance show arrival and departure information for all <b>platforms,</b> as do displays {{on each of the}} <b>platforms.</b> All <b>platforms</b> are signalled for trains in either direction and the flexible layout means that trains on any route can use any part of the station. <b>Platforms</b> with odd numbers are at the east end, even numbers at the west end (geographically the south, due to the curvature of the <b>platforms).</b>|$|E
5|$|Many pre-Columbian Native American {{societies}} of ancient North America built large pyramidal earth structures known as platform mounds. Among {{the largest and}} best-known of these structures is Monks Mound {{at the site of}} Cahokia in what became Illinois, completed around 1100 AD, which has a base larger than that of the Great Pyramid at Giza. Many of the mounds underwent multiple episodes of mound construction at periodic intervals, some becoming quite large. They are believed to have {{played a central role in}} the mound-building peoples' religious life and documented uses include semi-public chief's house <b>platforms,</b> public temple <b>platforms,</b> mortuary <b>platforms,</b> charnel house <b>platforms,</b> earth lodge/town house <b>platforms,</b> residence <b>platforms,</b> square ground and rotunda <b>platforms,</b> and dance <b>platforms.</b>|$|E

5|$|<b>Platforms</b> 12 and 13 were bay <b>platforms,</b> between <b>Platforms</b> 11 and 10, also curving east. All three bay <b>platforms</b> {{were for}} {{terminating}} services {{to and from}} Southport, Blackburn and Liverpool via Ormskirk. Platform 13 was added in 1913.|$|E
5|$|<b>Platforms</b> 5 and 6 {{formed the}} main, wide island platform, {{with a full}} set of {{buildings}} along its centre. The <b>platforms</b> were used mainly for West Coast Main Line services, northbound and southbound respectively. At the south end were two bay <b>platforms,</b> between <b>platforms</b> 5 and 6, used for short trains and goods vans.|$|E
5|$|The first island {{platform}} comprises <b>platforms</b> 5 to 8. Platform 5 {{is inside the}} main train shed while 6 is a southerly extension and 7 and 8 were added outside the supporting wall in the 1930s. Platform 5 is used by trains towards Cardiff and platform 7 to Portsmouth; <b>platforms</b> 6 and 8 are the main <b>platforms</b> for Weston-super-Mare and stations to Penzance. Between <b>platforms</b> 5 and 7 are the two spur sidings that are long enough to stable a single Class 153 DMU.|$|E

5000|$|Kuromatsunai Station has {{a single}} side <b>platform</b> (<b>platform</b> 1) and an island <b>platform</b> (<b>platform</b> 2,3) {{connected}} by an overpass.|$|R
5000|$|The {{station has}} 4 <b>platform</b> tracks, a [...] "home" [...] <b>platform</b> (next {{to the station}} building), an island <b>platform</b> and a side <b>platform.</b> The home <b>platform</b> (<b>platform</b> 1) is only used by Regionalbahn {{services}} running on the Schlüchtern-Jossa-Gemünden-Würzburg route, which begin and end here. The central <b>platform</b> (tracks 2 and 4) is used by Regional-Express services on the Frankfurt-Fulda route. The side <b>platform</b> (<b>platform</b> 5) is rarely used. About 3 km east of the station {{is the beginning of}} the Schlüchtern tunnel through the Distelrasen ridge.|$|R
5|$|The {{northbound}} side <b>platforms</b> of Bay Ridge Avenue and 77th Street do {{not have}} platform pillars because the <b>platforms</b> {{were supposed to be}} temporary; however, the southbound <b>platforms</b> do have pillars.|$|E
5|$|The third island {{platform}} comprises <b>platforms</b> 9 to 12 and also {{dates from the}} 1930s. It is longer than <b>platforms</b> 5–8 but the rear of a High Speed Train on the west end <b>platforms</b> will block part of the east end platform. A wide variety of trains use these <b>platforms,</b> including to and from London Paddington and London Waterloo and Weymouth.|$|E
5|$|Three {{parallel}} {{train tracks}} {{pass through the}} station, with two double-sided <b>platforms</b> between the central track and the outer tracks. The edges of the <b>platforms</b> are labelled platform 1 and 2, and platform 3 and 4, {{in such a way}} that the two outer tracks are accessible from <b>platforms</b> 1 and 4, and the central track, usually used by trains that terminate and reverse at Arnos Grove station, is accessible from <b>platforms</b> 2 and 3. <b>Platforms</b> 1 and 2 are designated for trains to Cockfosters while <b>platforms</b> 3 and 4 are for trains to Central London.|$|E

The island <b>platform</b> serves trains going down on <b>platform</b> 1 and some trains either go up or down on <b>platform</b> 2.|$|R
25|$|The middle island <b>platform</b> {{also has}} {{bi-directionally}} signalled through <b>platform</b> faces on each side, numbered 4 and 6, {{together with a}} west-facing terminal <b>platform</b> face numbered 5. <b>Platform</b> 4 can accommodate a five coach train, <b>platform</b> 5 a seven coach train, and <b>platform</b> 6 a fourteen coach train.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} digital radio {{stations}} also broadcast through digital cable <b>platforms,</b> including Virgin Media and WightFibre.|$|E
5|$|Access {{between the}} <b>platforms</b> is via a subway with ramps {{at the west}} end of the <b>platforms,</b> {{although}} the station is not considered completely accessible as the ramps are steeper than 1 in 12. The subway exits onto Fraser Street, which is the sole entrance to the station. The subway is decorated with murals painted by local schoolchildren, reflecting the history and culture of Bristol.|$|E
5|$|Arlene {{passed over}} several {{offshore}} oil <b>platforms</b> as it tracked northwestward across the Gulf of Mexico, producing gusty winds. The strongest surface wind gust reported {{in association with}} Arlene was clocked at 63mph (101km/h) on an oil platform south of Sabine Pass, Texas. Four other oil <b>platforms</b> experienced gusts or sustained winds of at least gale force.|$|E
5000|$|The main <b>platform</b> {{adjacent}} to the entrance is <b>platform</b> 4 which is mainly used for trains towards Exeter and Cardiff, as is <b>platform</b> 3 opposite. This is one side of an island <b>platform,</b> {{the opposite side of}} which is <b>platform</b> 2 which is used by trains to London Waterloo and [...] <b>Platform</b> 5 is a bay <b>platform</b> at the west end which is no longer used by passenger trains.

5000|$|The Ford C1 <b>platform</b> (for [...] "compact class") is Ford's {{global compact}} car {{automobile}} <b>platform.</b> It replaces Ford C170 <b>platform</b> and Mazda's BJ <b>platform.</b> The C1 <b>platform</b> debuted with the European Ford Focus C-Max compact MPV in early 2004. The <b>platform</b> {{is designed for}} either front- or all wheel drive.|$|R
50|$|A second <b>platform</b> {{is reached}} via a barrier-protected {{underpass}} that dates {{from a time}} when there was a much higher level of traffic. Beyond that {{there used to be a}} third <b>platform</b> accessed by a footbridge from <b>platform</b> 2. Today only the home <b>platform</b> (<b>platform</b> 1) is used, except when for a single, morning train crossing when the island <b>platform</b> (<b>platform</b> 2) is used.|$|R
5|$|Because of the hilly terrain, {{the station}} was built in a deep cutting {{excavated}} from Highgate Hill adjacent to Archway Road. Tunnels penetrated the hillside {{at each end of}} the station, leading towards East Finchley to the north and Crouch End to the south. When built, the station had two side <b>platforms,</b> with three tracks between them, and a station building on the south side. A footbridge linked the two <b>platforms.</b>|$|E
5|$|Between April and August 2016 the Bakerloo line <b>platforms</b> {{were closed}} to enable {{escalator}} replacements {{and the construction}} of connecting passageways to the new Crossrail <b>platforms</b> due to open in 2018. In December 2016 Westminster City Council approved proposals to construct a new mixed-use development called Paddington Quarter on a site adjacent to the mainline station. The plans include reconstruction of the Bakerloo line station to provide a larger ticket hall and better access between <b>platforms</b> and street level.|$|E
5|$|Between late 1962 {{and early}} 1964 the east {{ends of the}} <b>platforms</b> were {{extended}} to allow longer 8-car trains to be operated. This involved carefully enlarging the tunnels under the Metropolitan Police's original headquarters at New Scotland Yard (now Norman Shaw Buildings). The station was completely rebuilt to incorporate new deep-level <b>platforms</b> for the Jubilee line when it was extended to the London Docklands in the 1990s. During the works, {{the level of the}} sub-surface <b>platforms</b> was lowered to enable ground level access to Portcullis House. This was achieved in small increments which were carried out when the line was closed at night.|$|E
50|$|Kawawachō Station is an {{above ground}} station {{with a single}} island <b>platform</b> serving four {{elevated}} tracks. The station building is located underneath the tracks and <b>platform.</b> The <b>platform</b> is numbered <b>Platform</b> 3 and <b>Platform</b> 4. There is no <b>Platform</b> 1 or <b>Platform</b> 2, and these tracks are used as a rail yard for to removal of train carriages from the main rail lines of the Green Line.|$|R

5|$|Both NEC tracks have {{high-level}} <b>platforms,</b> {{which were}} added in 2001 {{for use by}} Acela Express trains (which cannot use low <b>platforms).</b> The southbound NEC track is served by a low platform behind the station, {{which leads to a}} short high-level platform south of State Street. The northbound NEC track is served by a high-level platform behind the station building; the low platform south of State Street is generally only used for deboarding passengers from busy trains. Because of the sharp curve, the high-level <b>platforms</b> are set slightly back from the tracks to avoid scraping the ends of train cars, and thus bridge plates are needed to span the gap between platform and car.|$|E
5|$|Both <b>platforms</b> have {{concrete}} windscreens {{on either}} end and steel canopies at the portions underneath the center station building. The <b>platforms</b> are offset, with the southbound platform extending {{slightly to the}} north, and the northbound platform extending slightly further south. An elevator {{and a set of}} staircases and escalators from each subway platform go up to the shared fare control.|$|E
