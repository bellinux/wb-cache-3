25|$|The only {{successful}} hijacking of a SAA flight {{took place}} on 24 May 1972, when a Boeing 727-044 (ZS-SBE) was hijacked en route from Salisbury, Rhodesia (now known as Harare, Zimbabwe) to Johannesburg. Two Lebanese, Kamil and Yagi, {{took control of the}} aircraft by <b>packing</b> dynamite <b>sticks</b> on the hatracks. They were armed with a pistol. They forced the pilot, Captain Blake Flemington, to return to Salisbury, where they landed and re-fuelled with 12 hostages remaining on board. The captain tricked them into thinking that they were en route to the Seychelles, while he was in fact heading for Blantyre, Malawi. After landing, the passengers used nightfall to enter the cockpit, where they climbed down the emergency escape rope. By the time the hijackers realised this, the captain, one passenger, and a flight steward, Dirk Nel, remained on the aircraft. The two hijackers started fighting with each other for possession of the dynamite fuse. In the ensuing chaos, the three captives escaped, leaving the two hijackers on board. Malawi security forces started shooting and the two surrendered. They were jailed for two years on a charge of being in possession of an undeclared firearm on board an aircraft. After serving one year of their sentence, they were released.|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{polyethylene}} packaging (PEP) (in air) and vacuum packaging (VP) on the histamine related quality of milkfish sticks stored at different temperatures (− 20 °C, 4 °C, 15 °C, and 25 °C) were studied. The {{results showed that}} the aerobic plate count (APC), pH, total volatile basic nitrogen (TVBN), and histamine contents increased as storage time increased when the PEP and VP samples were stored at 25 °C. At below 15 °C, the APC, TVBN, pH, and histamine levels in PEP and VP samples were retarded, but the VP samples had considerably lower levels of APC, TVBN, and histamine than PEP samples. Once the frozen fish samples stored at − 20 °C for 2 months were thawed and stored at 25 °C, VP retarded the increase of histamine in milkfish sticks as compared to PEP. In summary, this result suggested the milkfish <b>sticks</b> <b>packed</b> with VP and stored below 4 °C could prevent deterioration of product quality and extend shelf-life...|$|R
2500|$|The fossil {{remains of}} Agathaumas were first found in 1872 in southwestern Wyoming. They were {{discovered}} by Fielding Bradford Meek and Henry Martyn Bannister {{while they were}} looking for fossil shells in the Lance Formation (then Laramie Formation) near the Black Butte and Bitter Creek. Meek and Bannister were employed by Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden's Geological Survey of the Territories, and notified paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope of the find. Cope himself searched the ridge near Black Butte and re-discovered Meek's site, finding huge bones protruding from the rocks near a coal vein. The bones were preserved in sand and clay sediments, <b>packed</b> with fossil <b>sticks</b> and leaves, indicating a heavily forested habitat. Cope later (in 1873) described the skeleton as [...] "the wreck of one of the princes among giants." [...] Later in 1872, Cope published a description and name for the animal, Agathaumas sylvestris, or [...] "marvelous forest-dweller," [...] in reference to its great size and the environment revealed in the same rocks as its bones. The name Agathaumas has been cited as an example of Cope's excitement with this discovery, which he considered, at the time, as the largest known land animal that had ever lived. Several years later, with the discovery of the giant sauropod dinosaurs of the Morrison Formation, it became clear to him that British forms as Cetiosaurus and Pelorosaurus were land animals.|$|R
40|$|The fine {{structure}} of the longitudinal flagellum in Cerathtm tripos, which performs not only undulations but also retractions, has been examined in both the retracted and relaxed states. Although conventional fixation always triggered retraction, the flagellum was found to remain relaxed when it was washed briefly with CaI+-free medium prior to fixation. Previous light-microscopic investigation showed that it contained two fibres, the axoneme and the R-fibre. The present study by transmission electron microscopy has revealed that the axoneme {{that appeared to be}} a single fibre under the light microscope is a bundle of four fibres; the 9 + 2 microtubular axoneme, the packing material, the striated fibre, and the paraxial fibre. The first two are common in the longitudinal flagella of dinoflagellates, and the axoneme presumably generates the undulation. The last two are new and unique to the longitudinal flagellum of Ceratium. The R-fibre, which probably contracts to fold the flagellum during retraction, con-sists of fine filaments, which pursue a loosely spiral course in the contracted state, but align longitudinally in the relaxed state. Periodic striations appear only on the extended R-fibre. The R-fibre shortens to approximately one third of its extended length and pursues a left-handed helix. The <b>packing</b> material, which <b>sticks</b> to the microtubular axoneme on one side, is connected with the R-fibre on the other side at intervals of approximately 5 - 8 fim. The retraction seems to be regulated by the Cat+ concentration in the flagellum...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of using mouthpiece nebulization and nasal swab <b>stick</b> <b>packing</b> for topical anesthesia in awake fiberoptic nasotracheal intubation. Material and Method: This was a prospective descriptive study of 30 patients with ASA I-II who underwent elective surgery and suspected of difficult intubation between March 2004 and June 2006. After 2 % lidocaine 5 ml was nebulizated in a micronebulizer using oxygen 10 L/min as a driving gas through a standard mouth-piece and 10 % cocaine 1 ml on cotton swab-stick was applied to the selected nostril for 15 min, fiberoptic nasotracheal intubation was done while the patient was awake. If the patient had severe gag or cough reflex, 1 % lidocaine 5 ml per each time could be injected through the working channel of the fiberoptic broncho-scope. The descriptive statistics were calculated by using SPSS version 11. 0. Results: The success rate of awake fiberoptic nasotracheal was 100 %. The mean duration of awake fiberoptic nasotracheal intubation was 119. 0 + 76. 8 sec. The responses of the patient to instrumentation during 4 periods, i. e. : passing the endotracheal tube into the nose, passing the bronchoscope into the pharynx-larynx, passing the bronchoscope into the trachea-carina and passing the endotracheal tube into the trachea were, as follows: no response in about 53. 3 %, 63. 3 %, 23. 3 %,and 13. 3 %; mild pain or reflex in about 46. 7 %, 10 %, 70 %, and 86. 7 %; moderate pain or reflex in about 0 %, 3. 3 %, 6. 7 %, and 0 %; and severe pain or refle...|$|R
40|$|Obesity Due to Poor Snack Choices and Lack of Physical Activity A chronic {{issue in}} my {{immediate}} community, Murray State University, is obesity due to unhealthy diets and a generally lethargic lifestyle. The muffin picture represents the average healthiness of snacks available on campus. While students are working towards their education on campus {{it has become}} increasingly difficult to acquire snacks that are both convenient and health conscious. Places such as the T-Room cater towards less healthy foods by making them far more available and also making them much less expensive. For a student to get a quick lunch consisting of a grilled cheese, fries, and soft drink the price is 8. 48 while if that same student wanted a ready-made cobb salad with turkey, a water, a sausage and cheese <b>stick</b> <b>pack,</b> and a fruit dip cup the price would cost 11. 36. Both of these meals are similar in their respective caloric densities but meal one has a far less healthy macro balance, being high in fats and carbs, and is also fried or cooked with a lot of butter. Furthermore, the amount of sugar in the soft drink has its own health implications as well. These factors lead to students putting on unhealthy weight and the unhealthy food also does not fuel the body well for physical activity. Leading on to my community asset I posted a picture of me in D. C. I work as a personal trainer at a local gym Downtown Dynabody and I have worked as a group fitness instructor at the MSU wellness center for a number of years. During my time a a fitness professional I have worked with many people to help change their views of what it takes to become fit, promote working towards a better version of themselves, and I have helped a few people reach fitness goals beyond what they believed possible. My job as personal trainer is to be 2 ̆ 2 team motivation 2 ̆ 2 as well as to listen to my clients, adapt their training to optimize its effectiveness, and to teach them how to so things properly. By doing my part working with the few clients I have, I am able to also influence those who come in contact with my clients. People see others in the community making healthy life changes to better their health, lose weight, and improve their body image and the idea that it is obtainable for them as well spreads like wild fire. Case based examples in the community as well as changing the community views of obesity are crucial in fighting this epidemic. To combat the obesity problem at MSU a two-part challenge is set before us. Both a physical aspect, stressing the importance of being more physically active, and the nutritional aspect, eating correctly and having healthy food available to busy students. Using community ambassadors, community based challenges, and using the assets at our disposal can help change the trend of the 2 ̆ 2 freshman 152 ̆ 2 or worse the 2 ̆ 2 sophomore 302 ̆ 2. With less unhealthy weight gain and a more balanced diet health risks associated with obesity as well as health issues students may currently have as well as those that may present in the future due to obesity, poor nutrition, or lack of exercise. Our country as a whole has a large population of people suffering from or at risk for heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure; all of which can be reduced or completely resolved with a healthier diet, active lifestyle, and lower body fat. As with most things, education and understanding are the most important factors in making lifestyle changes towards a healthier life...|$|R
