5|$|Although {{nitrogen}} is non-toxic, when {{released into}} an enclosed space it can displace oxygen, and therefore presents an asphyxiation hazard. This may happen with few warning symptoms, since the human carotid {{body is a}} relatively <b>poor</b> <b>and</b> slow low-oxygen (hypoxia) sensing system.
