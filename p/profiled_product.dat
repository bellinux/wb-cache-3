40|$|A dynamic-programming {{heuristic}} {{is described}} to find approximate {{solutions to the}} problem of identifying a new, multi-attribute <b>product</b> <b>profile</b> associated with the highest share-of-choices in a competitive market. The input data consist of idiosyncratic multi-attribute preference functions estimated using conjoint or hybrid-conjoint analysis. An individual is assumed to choose a new <b>product</b> <b>profile</b> if he/she associates a higher utility with it than with a status-quo alternative. Importance weights are assigned to individuals to account for differences in their purchase and/or usage rates and the performance of a new <b>product</b> <b>profile</b> is evaluated after taking into account its cannibalization of a seller's existing brands. In a simulation with real-sized problems, the proposed heuristic strictly dominates an alternative lagrangian-relaxation heuristic in terms of both computational time and approximation of the optimal solution. Across 192 simulated problems, the dynamic-programming heuristic identifies <b>product</b> <b>profiles</b> whose share-of-choices, on average, are 98. 2 % of the share-of-choices of the optimal <b>product</b> <b>profile,</b> suggesting that it closely approximates the optimal solution. marketing, product design, conjoint analysis, heuristics...|$|R
40|$|Conjoint {{analysis}} (also called stated preference analysis) {{involves the}} use of designed hypothetical choice situations to measure individuals’ preferences and predict their choice in new situations. Conjoint experiments involve the design and analysis of hypothetical decision tasks. Alternatives are described by their main features, called attributes. Multiple hypothetical alternatives (<b>product</b> <b>profiles)</b> are generated and presented to respondents, who are requested to express their degree of preference for these profiles. Conjoint experiments have become a popular tool to model individual preferences and decision-making in a variety of research areas. Most studies of conjoint analysis have involved a verbal description of <b>product</b> <b>profiles,</b> although some studies have used a pictorial presentation of <b>product</b> <b>profiles.</b> This paper describes a framework for a conjoint analysis system in a virtual environment. <b>Product</b> <b>profiles</b> are generated in a virtual environment and respondents are requested to choose in that virtual environment the <b>product</b> <b>profile</b> they prefer. Advantages of a virtual environment in this area of research include 3 D presentation, improved experience and the possibility to include measurable attributes such as time and sound. This framework is a first attempt to explore the possibilities of virtual reality systems in conjoint analysis...|$|R

40|$|Comparisons of {{satellite}} temperature <b>profile</b> <b>products</b> from GPS radio occultation (RO) and hyperspectral infrared (IR) /microwave (MW) sounders are made using a previously developed matchup technique. The profile matchup technique matches GPS RO and IR/MW sounder profiles temporally, within 1 h, and spatially, {{taking into account}} the unique RO profile geometry and theoretical spatial resolution by calculating a ray-path averaged sounder profile. The comparisons use the GPS RO dry temperature product. Sounder minus GPS RO differences are computed and used to calculate bias and rms profile statistics, which are created for global and 30 ° latitude zones for selected time periods. These statistics are created from various combinations of temperature profile data from the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere & Climate (COSMIC) network, Global Navigation Satellite System Receiver for Atmospheric Sounding (GRAS) instrument, and the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) /Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU), Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) /AMSU, and Crosstrack Infrared Sounder (CrIS) /Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) sounding systems. By overlaying combinations of these matchup statistics for similar time and space domains, comparisons of different sounders' products, sounder product versions, and GPS RO products can be made. The COSMIC GPS RO network has the spatial coverage, time continuity, and stability to provide a common reference for comparison of the sounder <b>profile</b> <b>products.</b> The results of this study demonstrate that GPS RO has potential to act as a common temperature reference and can help facilitate inter-comparison of sounding retrieval methods and also highlight differences among sensor product versions...|$|R
