5|$|Quatermass 2 was {{released}} on Region 2 DVD in 2003 by DD Video. It contained a number of extra features including commentary by director Val Guest and writer Nigel Kneale, {{as well as an}} interview with Val Guest and a trailer for Enemy From Space, as the film is known in the US. The film was first released in the US on Region 1 DVD by Anchor Bay Entertainment and is mastered from an archival <b>print</b> <b>that</b> shows every image with razor-sharp clarity and richness; it contains the same extra features as on the Region 2 UK release. The film had been previously released on both VHS cassette and LaserDisc.|$|E

25|$|Around 1920, {{the first}} {{practical}} subtractive color processes were introduced. These also used black-and-white film to photograph multiple color-filtered source images, {{but the final}} product was a multicolored <b>print</b> <b>that</b> did not require special projection equipment. Before 1932, when three-strip Technicolor was introduced, commercialized subtractive processes used only two color components and could reproduce only a limited range of color.|$|E

25|$|The {{insertion}} {{of a dream}} sequence of a unicorn running through a forest. The original sequence of the dream—showing Deckard intercut with the running unicorn—was not found in a print of sufficient quality. Arick was thus forced to use a different <b>print</b> <b>that</b> shows only the unicorn running, without any intercutting to Deckard. This unicorn scene suggests a completely different interpretation {{at the end of}} the film: Gaff's origami unicorn means that Deckard's dreams are known to him, implying that Deckard's memories are artificial and that therefore he is a replicant of the same generation as Rachael.|$|E
25|$|Beyond Words {{moved into}} an office along Cornell Road in the Tanasbourne {{neighborhood}} of Hillsboro in 2006. In 2004, the company was struggling and considered filling for bankruptcy protection until a new investor was brought on board. That year Beyond Words had its first big success, after more than 250 titles to their name, with Masaru Emoto’s Hidden Messages of Water. The book sold {{enough to make the}} New York Times Best Seller list and sold a total of half a million copies. The company started a partnership with publisher Simon & Schuster’s subsidiary Atria Books in 2006. That same year the company had a dinner party where one of the commentators from The Secret DVD convinced the group to watch the video, which led to the publication of the book, The Secret by Rhonda Byrne. By March 2007, the book had become the top seller on Amazon.com as well as listing on The New York Times bestseller list, and had 1.75 million copies in <b>print.</b> <b>That</b> month Simon & Schuster ordered an additional 2 million copies in what was their largest reorder in their history. By 2003, the Secret had over five million copies in hardcover.|$|E

500|$|In the mid-1990s, Criterion Collection {{released}} the first-cut 205-minute version of Andrei Rublev on laserdisc, which Criterion re-issued on DVD in 1999.

According to Tarkovsky's sister, Marina Tarkovskaya, one of {{the editors of the}} film, Lyudmila Feiginova, secretly kept a print of the 205-minute cut under her bed. Criterion's producer of the project stated that the video transfer was sourced from a film <b>print</b> <b>that</b> filmmaker Martin Scorsese had acquired while visiting Russia.

500|$|Fantoma Films and Image Entertainment {{released}} The Great Silence on DVD on September 4, 2001, {{with their}} release being the film's first {{appearance on the}} American market. The release used an English-language <b>print</b> <b>that</b> was digitally remastered by Zoetrope Aubry Productions, presented in [...] letterboxed widescreen, with the only audio option being a Dolby Digital Mono mix of the English dub. The DVD's special features consist of a video introduction to the film by Alex Cox, the alternative happy ending (with optional commentary by Cox), and the English version of the film's trailer. Fantoma reissued the disc on January 27, 2004. Glenn Erickson felt that the transfer on Fantoma's DVD was [...] "reasonable but not great" [...] due to the transfer having washed-out colours despite being clean from damage. Erickson also felt that the English dub [...] "still plays as artificial and false, and detracts mightily from Kinski's performance" [...] despite praising the voice acting itself.|$|E

During the week {{leading up to the}} game, Mitchell sat for a short ESPN interview conducted by Dan Patrick. [...] Asked to identify the members of the Patriots' secondary, Mitchell claimed he did not know them by name, only by number, and then deliberately stated each of their numbers incorrectly. Finally, he said he [...] "had something" [...] for safety Rodney Harrison. Harrison responded by calling Mitchell a [...] "jerk." [...] Normally tight-lipped coach Patriots head coach Bill Belichick later said of Mitchell, [...] "ll he does is talk. [...] He's terrible, and you can <b>print</b> <b>that.</b> [...] I was happy {{when he was in the}} game." [...] Mitchell caught only one pass for 11yards in the 24–21 loss.

500|$|Many of the better-known British writers {{began to}} appear in Nebula, {{including}} William F. Temple and Eric Frank Russell; new authors also began to be published. [...] Hamilton was glad to work with beginning writers, and in 1953 several writers who later became very well known, including Brian Aldiss, Barrington Bayley, and Bob Shaw, each sold their first story to Nebula. [...] Not all these stories reached <b>print</b> <b>that</b> year: Aldiss’s [...] "T" [...] appeared in the November 1956 issue, by which time other stories of Aldiss’s were in print, and the first story by Bayley is not certainly identified – it may have been [...] "Consolidation", which appeared in November 1959, but {{it is also possible that}} it was never printed. [...] Robert Silverberg had begun submitting stories to Hamilton as soon as he heard of Nebula, realizing that Hamilton was unlikely to be getting many submissions from US writers, and found Hamilton very helpful. Silverberg's first story, [...] "Gorgon Planet", was accepted by Hamilton on January 11, 1954. [...] Brian Aldiss echoes Silverberg's assessment of Hamilton, commenting that Hamilton was [...] "a sympathetic editor to a beginner. [...] He was also a patient editor." ...|$|E
500|$|The first written {{reference}} of the koala {{was recorded}} by John Price, servant of John Hunter, the Governor of New South Wales. Price encountered the [...] "cullawine" [...] on 26 January 1798, during {{an expedition to}} the Blue Mountains, although his account was not published until nearly a century later in Historical Records of Australia. In 1802, French-born explorer Francis Louis Barrallier encountered the animal when his two Aboriginal guides, returning from a hunt, brought back two koala feet they were intending to eat. Barrallier preserved the appendages and sent them and his notes to Hunter's successor, Philip Gidley King, who forwarded them to Joseph Banks. Similar to Price, Barrallier's notes were not published until 1897. Reports of the first capture of a live [...] "koolah" [...] appeared in The Sydney Gazette in August 1803. [...] Within a few weeks Flinders' astronomer, James Inman, purchased a specimen pair for live shipment to Joseph Banks in England. They were described as 'somewhat larger than the Waumbut (Wombat)'. These encounters helped provide the impetus for King to commission the artist John Lewin to paint watercolours of the animal. Lewin painted three pictures, {{one of which was}} subsequently made into a <b>print</b> <b>that</b> was reproduced in Georges Cuvier's The Animal Kingdom (first published in 1827) and several European works on natural history.|$|E

500|$|The {{species was}} first named 1936 as Boletus felleus forma plumbeoviolaceus by American mycologist Walter H. Snell {{and one of}} his {{graduate}} students, Esther A. Dick, based on specimens found in the Black Rock Forest near Cornwall, New York. Regarding his decision to use the taxonomic rank forma, Snell wrote: [...] "The writer hesitates to multiply the number of forms (formae) and varieties with distinctive names, because of the ease with which one develops the habit of interpreting slight variations as definite taxonomic units... the word [...] "form" [...] is used instead of [...] "variety" [...] as making no commitment as to the actual status of the variable segregate under consideration, until further information is available." [...] The first collections made of the mushroom were of young, immature specimens, from which authors were unable to obtain spores for examination. It was not until a few years after that they found mature fruit bodies, which revealed that the rosy color of the pore surface took some time to develop. They concluded that this and other differences in physical characteristics, as well as differences in spore size, were enough to justify it being a species distinct from B.felleus, so in 1941 they raised the taxon to species status with the name Boletus plumbeoviolaceus. Noted Agaricales taxonomist Rolf Singer later transferred the taxon to Tylopilus in 1947, a genus characterized by a spore <b>print</b> <b>that</b> is pink, or wine red (vinaceous), rather than brown as in Boletus.|$|E
