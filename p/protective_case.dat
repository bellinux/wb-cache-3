2500|$|Although {{the flight}} data {{recorder}} (FDR) outer <b>protective</b> <b>case</b> was damaged, the data tape inside was intact and all the data was recoverable. Five parameters were recorded by the FDR: heading, altitude, airspeed, normal acceleration (G loads), and microphone keying. [...] The FDR did not record rudder, aileron or spoiler deflection data, which could have aided the NTSB in reconstructing the plane's final moments. The data available proved insufficient to establish why the plane suddenly went into the fatal dive. The NTSB considered the possibilities of a malfunction of the rudder power control unit servo (which might have caused the rudder to reverse) {{and the effect of}} powerful rotor winds from the nearby Rocky Mountains might have had, but there was not enough evidence to prove either hypothesis.|$|E
