The quantitative study of metamorphism comprises experimental phase-chemical studies, thermodynamic calculations {{and the study of}} metamorphic mineral assemblages by means of the electron microprobe. Consequently, the metamorphic petrologist today is capable of calculating accurately the distribution of temperature and pressure in the earth's crust with time within approximately 50 °C and a few hundred bars. This makes it possible for him to examine, from a quantitative point of view, the continuous adjustment (that is, the submersion, heating and consequent elevation, erosion and cooling = PoT-time loops) of rock masses under changing physical conditions. Since the mineralogical and chemical composition, fabric and field-relations of metamorphic rock formations are a reflection of the underlying geological processes which {{played a role in the}} evolution of the earth's crust, metamorphism may thus be regarded as the key to identifying <b>primordial</b> <b>areas</b> of mountain formation. The chemographic analysis of phase-relations in metamorphic rock formations and the identification of continuous and discontinuous metamorphic reactions form the basis for the construction of petrogenetic diagrams by means of which different p-T loops may be deduced. These loops are then used to make deductions concerning the underlying geological processes. The study of metamorphism is, however, not simply an interesting geological exercise, but the information gained from this type of examination plays an important role in the establishment of models of exploration which are used by mining companies to locate ore deposits in complex metamorphic areas...|$|E

The analysis of a revaylding in the conditions of Belarus is made for the first time for the territory of one of the largest fore st complexes of Eastern Europe – the Naliboksky dense forest. The specific structure of megafauna of the Nali boksky dense forest, and also process of restoration of populations of such large phytophages as a red deer and a bison is studied. For a local site population density of representatives of megafauna is studied: bison, elk, red deer, roe, boar, bear, wolf and lynx. Calculation of impact of phytophages on forest ecosystems by calculation of the consumed phytoweight is made. The main forms of influence of views engineers of forest ecosys tems – zoogene glades and reservoirs, and their value for increase of heterogeneity of habitat and preservation of a biodiversity are considered. For further restora-tion of ecosystems of the woods, characteristic for the doagrikulturnykh, the list of the types which are of interest to the subsequent installation is offered: fallow deer European, Przhevalsky’s horse, tur cattle...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we review}} {{evidence}} from comparative studies of primate cortical organization, highlighting recent findings and hypotheses {{that may help}} us to understand the rules governing evolutionary changes of the cortical map {{and the process of}} formation of areas during development. We argue that clear unequivocal views of cortical areas and their homologies are more likely to emerge for ‘core’ fields, including the primary sensory areas, which are specified early in development by precise molecular identification steps. In primates, the middle temporal area is probably one of these <b>primordial</b> cortical fields. <b>Areas</b> that form at progressively later stages of development correspond to progressively more recent evolutionary events, their development being less firmly anchored in molecular specification. The certainty with which areal boundaries can be delimited, and likely homologies can be assigned, becomes increasingly blurred in parallel with this evolutionary/developmental sequence. For example, while current concepts for the definition of cortical areas have been vindicated in allowing a clarification of the organization of the New World monkey ‘third tier’ visual cortex (the third and dorsomedial areas, V 3 and DM), our analyses suggest that more flexible mapping criteria may be needed to unravel the organization of higher-order visual association and polysensory areas...|$|R
40|$|At the {{transition}} from early reptilian ancestors to <b>primordial</b> mammals, the <b>areas</b> of sensory cortex that process topographic modalities acquire the laminar structure of isocortex. A prominent step in lamination is granulation, whereby the formerly unique principal layer of pyramidal cells is split by the insertion of a new layer of excitatory, but intrinsic, granule cells, layer IV. I consider the hypothesis that granulation, and the differentiation between supra- and infra-granular pyramidal layers, may be advantageous to support fine topography in their sensory maps. Fine topography implies a generic distinction between "where" information, explicitly mapped on the cortical sheet, and "what" information, represented in a distributed fashion as a distinct firing pattern across neurons. These patterns can be stored on recurrent collaterals in the cortex, and such memory can help substantially {{in the analysis of}} current sensory input. The simulation of a simplified network model demonstrates that a non-laminated patch of cortex must compromise between transmitting "where" information or retrieving "what" information. The simulation of a modified model including differentiation of a granular layer shows a modest but significant quantitative advantage, expressed as a less severe trade-off between "what" and "where". The further connectivity differentiation between infra-granular and supra-granular pyramidal layers is shown to match the mix of "what" and "where" information optimal for their respective target structures...|$|R
40|$|Pre-print de capítulo en Branciforte, L. Madrid, 2013 El texto que sigue contiene un conjunto de reflexiones a propósito de la {{historia de}} las relaciones ítalo españolas, su historia común en torno a un continente de agua: el Mediterráneo. Italia y España son países explicables solo desde su condición de naciones modernas, de entronque europeo, pero al mismo tiempo, ambas: balcones abiertos al Mediterráneo. Sin embargo, en los dos casos se ha pasado de una condición mediterránea a una atracción atlántica, que, en tiempos distintos, las vincularía con la navegación, el comercio y las migraciones. El entendimiento mutuo ha sido durante el siglo XX parte del mito hispano italiano, construido sobre la cercanía física, la afinidad lingüística y cultural. La distancia y el extrañamiento surgieron sin embargo de la experiencia histórica que, en las décadas siguientes al final de la II Guerra Mundial alejó a los dos países. Italia fue modelo para España de lo moderno en la tradición durante los años sesenta y setenta. Esta imagen se produjo en Italia con respecto a España a partir de los años noventa. En el presente, y ya ambas en el seno de la Unión Europea y al amparo de políticas comunes, Italia y España van juntas en muchos terrenos. No está tan claro sin embargo que ambas hayan entendido al fin que el Mediterráneo es su <b>área</b> <b>primordial</b> de experiencia común futura. The {{following}} text contains {{a set of}} reflections {{on the history of}} Spanish-Italian relations, and the common history around a continent of water: the Mediterranean Sea. Italy and Spain are understood only from their status as modern nations of Europe junction, but at the same time, both: balconies opened to the Mediterranean Sea. However, in both cases, these countries have gone –in different historic times- from a Mediterranean condition to an Atlantic attraction. This one tied them with the shipping, trade and migration traditions. Mutual understanding has been in twentieth century a part of Hispanic-Italian myth that has been built on physical proximity, linguistic and cultural affinity. However, the distance and estrangement arose from past experience, in the decades following the end of World War II. Italy became a model of modern ways to Spain during the sixties and seventies. This image was the one produced in Italy with regard to Spain from the nineties to the beginning of XXI century. At present time, being both, Italy and Spain within the EU and under common policies, they must go together in many areas. It is less clear, however, that they finally have understood that the Mediterranean is their primary area to a common future experience...|$|R
