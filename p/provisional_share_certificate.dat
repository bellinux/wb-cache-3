50|$|Certain {{corporate}} documents, {{for example}} <b>share</b> <b>certificates</b> are often issued under the company seal (and some countries required that <b>share</b> <b>certificates</b> be issued under the common seal).

50|$|In Sweden, <b>share</b> <b>certificates</b> {{have been}} largely abolished, people using {{electronic}} shares instead (which are either registered in the share owner's name or in the share owner's broker's name). <b>Share</b> <b>certificates</b> may exist in Sweden, {{but only if the}} shares are not listed on any stock exchange in Sweden, and the availability of <b>share</b> <b>certificates</b> {{has nothing to do with}} voting in shareholders' general meetings.|$|R
50|$|Originally, {{shareholders}} {{could be}} literally anonymous and collect dividends by surrendering coupons {{attached to their}} <b>share</b> <b>certificates.</b> Dividends were therefore paid to whoever held the <b>certificate.</b> <b>Share</b> <b>certificates</b> could be transferred privately, and therefore {{the management of the}} company would not necessarily know who owned its shares.|$|R

50|$|Margit Osterloh published, {{together}} with Bruno S. Frey, a much-noticed {{article in the}} Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. In analogy to the cooperative model, they propose that refugees acquire a <b>share</b> <b>certificate</b> {{of the state in}} order to enter the country. In return they get permission to work in the labor market. If a refugee is recognized as a political asylum seeker, the fee paid for the <b>share</b> <b>certificate</b> will be reimbursed. The currently inhumane and life-threatening defense against refugees and the exploitation by criminal traffickers is thereby reduced. Refugees receive a calculable perspective and incentives for integration. The proposal offers advantages for the countries of destination and origin, as well as for migrants.|$|R
50|$|In {{corporate}} law, a {{stock certificate}} (also known as certificate of stock or <b>share</b> <b>certificate)</b> {{is a legal}} document that certifies ownership of a specific number of shares or stock in a corporation. Historically, certificates may have been required to evidence entitlement to dividends, with a receipt for the payment being endorsed on the back; and the original certificate may have been required to be provided to effect {{the transfer of the}} shareholding. Over time, these functions have been rendered redundant by statutory schemes to streamline the administrative burden on corporations, and to facilitate and streamline trading on a stock exchange. For example, most jurisdictions now impose an obligation on corporations to pay dividends to shareholders registered at a relevant point of time without the need to produce the <b>share</b> <b>certificate</b> as proof of entitlement and the certificate is no longer required to be produced with a transfer of a shareholding. In some jurisdictions today, the issue of paper stock certificates may be dispensed with, at least in some circumstances, and many corporations now provide a holding statement in lieu of a <b>share</b> <b>certificate</b> for each parcel of shares owned.|$|R
