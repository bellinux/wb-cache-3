50|$|The {{phase shift}} process used with passive phase array {{typically}} puts the receive beam and transmit beam into diagonally opposite quadrants. The {{sign of the}} phase shift must be inverted after the transmit pulse is finished and before the receive period begins to place the receive beam into the same location as the transmit beam. That requires a <b>phase</b> <b>impulse</b> that degrades sub-clutter visibility performance on Doppler radar and Pulse-Doppler radar. As an example, Yttrium iron garnet phase shifters must be changed after transmit pulse quench and before receiver processing starts to align transmit and receive beams. That impulse introduces FM noise that degrades clutter performance.|$|E
40|$|In arena blast testing, {{a common}} and {{economical}} practice employed is to distribute several targets radially around a central charge. However, if these targets are positioned too proximally, reflections and diffractions of blast waves off neighbouring cubicles {{can affect the}} nature of expected blast loading. Computational fluid dynamics software has been used through an extensive series of simulations to identify the levels of interference in incident pressure–time histories with and without an obstructing target present. The data were post-processed to identify the Cartesian co-ordinates in which different levels of interference in peak incident overpressure and incident positive <b>phase</b> <b>impulse</b> were achieved. The results indicated that in all cases, there was a greater interference in peak incident overpressure than incident positive <b>phase</b> <b>impulse</b> values directly proximal to the target but, at greater separations, significant differences in incident positive <b>phase</b> <b>impulse</b> existed where peak incident overpressure had returned to free-field equivalent magnitudes. When compared with the established ‘rules of thumb’ for cubicle placement, for targets at different stand-off ranges, an angle of 45 ° to the rear cubicle still holds some practical relevance, although it is too acute to cover all interference effects. For targets positioned at the same stand-off range, a separation distance of two cubicle widths is generally too conservative and, in many cases, more cubicles can be positioned around the charge. A bespoke recommendation table has been presented for targets at stand-off ranges between 15 and 50 m to allow users to identify the minimum distance from a target at which obstructed-field peak incident overpressure and incident positive <b>phase</b> <b>impulse</b> values differ negligibly from free-field equivalents...|$|E

The plasma processes associated with the negative impulse are again divided into the three phases—the preliminary <b>impulse</b> <b>phase,</b> and {{the first and second}} main <b>impulse</b> <b>phases</b> in terms of the ionosphere-magnetosphere coupling.

40|$|In {{large-scale}} arena blast testing, {{a common}} and economical practice undertaken is to position several cubicle targets radially around a central charge. To gain maximal benefit from this, targets should be positioned at their minimum permissible separation at which no blast wave interference is sustained from neighbouring obstructions. This interference typically occurs either when targets positioned {{at the same}} stand-off range are too close creating an amplification effect where a superposition forms between the incident blast wave and the reflected wave off the cubicle, or, where a target is positioned in the region behind another target, which causes a shadowing effect with decreased magnitudes of pressure and impulse. A comprehensive computational modelling study was undertaken using the hydrocode Air 3 D to examine the influence of cubicle positioning at different ranges on the surrounding blast wave pressure-time fields. A systematic series of simulations were conducted to show the differences in incident peak overpressure and positive <b>phase</b> <b>impulse</b> between free-field and obstructed-field simulation configurations. The predictions from the modelling study indicated {{that the presence of}} cubicle target obstructions resulted in differences in peak incident overpressure and positive <b>phase</b> <b>impulse</b> in nearby pressure waves. In all cases, at close separation distances, there were greater differences in peak pressure than positive <b>phase</b> <b>impulse.</b> However, with increased separation, peak pressure returned to free-field conditions sooner whilst differences in impulse remained significant, thus governing separation distance recommendations. The simulations showed that, for targets at the same stand-off range, clear separations of between 3. 88 m and 6. 92 m were required to achieve free-field equivalency, depending on the distance from the charge to the target. For targets at different stand-off ranges an angle greater than 54. 2 ° from the front corner of the cubicle has been shown to ensure free-field equivalent conditions. A bespoke recommendation table has been generated to provide precise positioning for cubicles at different stand-off ranges in a look-up matrix format that can be readily used by engineers in the field...|$|E

40|$|The {{angle and}} {{frequency}} dependent reflective {{properties of the}} seabed can be determined from beam-steered ambient noise measurements on a vertical array of hydrophones. From the up-to-down ratio the beam-smeared modulus square of the plane wave reflection coefficient is obtained. Geo-acoustic parameters can be inverted by matching the measured and modelled reflection loss assuming {{a certain number of}} sediment layers. The searching for the geo-acoustic parameters is done with fast global optimisation techniques such as differential evolution. An alternative approach is to Fourier transform the reflection coefficient producing the minimum <b>phase</b> <b>impulse</b> response, which explicitly shows layer boundaries. Spectral factorisation is applied to restore the lost phase of the reflection coefficient. This method offers the possibility of determining the number of layers and their order. Both methods were applied to reflection loss data extracted from ambient noise measurements on a drifting vertical array in the shallow waters in the Mediterranean. The results of both methods are compared showing good agreement between the two sets of sediment layering estimates. It is concluded that the methods offer a sub-bottom profiling technique without making additional sound where the array is sensing local seabed properties with a footprint of order the water depth...|$|E
40|$|Two-dimensional {{axisymmetric}} hydrodynamic {{models were}} developed using GEODYN {{to simulate the}} propagation of air blasts resulting {{from a series of}} high explosive detonations conducted at Kirtland Air Force Base in August and September of 2007. Dubbed Humble Redwood I (HR- 1), these near-surface chemical high explosive detonations consisted of seven shots of varying height or depth of burst. Each shot was simulated numerically using GEODYN. An adaptive mesh refinement scheme based on air pressure gradients was employed such that the mesh refinement tracked the advancing shock front where sharp discontinuities existed in the state variables, but allowed the mesh to sufficiently relax behind the shock front for runtime efficiency. Comparisons of overpressure, sound speed, and positive <b>phase</b> <b>impulse</b> from the GEODYN simulations were made to the recorded data taken from each HR- 1 shot. Where the detonations occurred above ground or were shallowly buried (no deeper than 1 m), the GEODYN model was able to simulate the sound speeds, peak overpressures, and positive phase impulses to within approximately 1 %, 23 %, and 6 %, respectively, of the actual recorded data, supporting the use of numerical simulation of the air blast as a forensic tool in determining the yield of an otherwise unknown explosion...|$|E
40|$|When {{evaluating}} the dynamic response of a structure {{subjected to a}} high explosive detonation, {{it is common to}} simplify both the target properties and the form of the blast pressure load - a standard approach is to model the target as an equivalent Single-Degree-of-Freedom (SDOF) system with the blast load idealised as a pulse which decays linearly with time. Whilst this method is suitable for cases where the reflecting surface is large, {{it is well known that}} for smaller targets, the propagation of a rarefaction 'clearing' wave from the edges of the target may cause a premature reduction in the magnitude of the blast pressure and hence reduce the total impulse acting on the structure. In this article, a simple method for calculating clearing relief, based on an acoustic approximation of the rarefaction wave, is coupled with an SDOF model to investigate the influence of clearing on the dynamic response of elastic targets. Response spectra are developed for a range of target sizes and blast events that may be of interest to the engineer, enabling the effects of blast wave clearing to be evaluated and situations where blast wave clearing may increase the peak displacement of the target to be determined. When the natural period of the target is large compared to the duration of loading, the reduction in positive <b>phase</b> <b>impulse</b> leads to significantly lower values of peak displacement when compared to an identical system subjected to a triangular blast load. For systems where the natural period is comparable to the duration of the loading, the early onset of negative pressure (attributed to blast wave clearing) can coincide with the rebound of the target and result in greater peak displacements. It is concluded that blast wave clearing should be evaluated and its influence quantified in order to ensure that blast resistant designs are efficient and safe. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} in non-surgical gait rehabilitation treatments to reduce the loading in the knee joint. In particular, synergetic kinematic changes required for joint offloading should be determined individually for each subject. Previous studies for gait rehabilitation designs are typically relied on a “trial-and-error” approach, using multi-body dynamic (MBD) analysis. However MBD is fairly time demanding which prevents it to be used iteratively for each subject. This study employed an artificial neural network to develop a cost-effective computational framework for designing gait rehabilitation patterns. A feed forward artificial neural network (FFANN) was trained based {{on a number of}} experimental gait trials obtained from literature. The trained network was then hired to calculate the appropriate kinematic waveforms (output) needed to achieve desired knee joint loading patterns (input). An auxiliary neural network was also developed to update the ground reaction force and moment profiles with respect to the predicted kinematic waveforms. The feasibility and efficiency of the predicted kinematic patterns were then evaluated through MBD analysis. Resuls showed that FFANN-based predicted kinematics could effectively decrease the total knee joint reaction forces. Peak values of the resultant knee joint forces, with respect to the bodyweight (BW), were reduced by 20 % BW and 25 % BW in the midstance and the terminal stance <b>phases.</b> <b>Impulse</b> values of the knee joint loading patterns were also decreased by 17 % BW*s and 24 %BW*s in the corresponding phases.
