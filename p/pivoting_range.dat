40|$|Variable Geometry Turbochargers (VGT) {{are widely}} used to improve engine-turbocharger {{matching}} and currently common in diesel engines. VGT has proven to provide air boost for wide engine speed range as well as reduce turbo-lag. This thesis presents the design and experimental evaluation of a variable geometry mixed flow turbocharger turbine. The mixed flow rotor {{used in this study}} consists of 12 blades with a constant inlet blade angle of + 20 °, a cone angle of 50 ° and a tip diameter of 95. 2 mm. A variable geometry stator has been designed within this work, consists of 15 vanes fitted into a ring mechanism with a <b>pivoting</b> <b>range</b> between 40 ° and 80 °. A novel nozzle vane was designed to have 40 ° lean stacking (from the axial direction). This geometrically achieves 3 -dimensional match with the mixed flow rotor and aims to improve the turbine stage performance. A conventional straight nozzle vane was also constructed {{in order to have a}} comparative design to assess the benefits of the new lean vane. The steady flow performance results are presented for vane angle settings of 40 °, 50 °, 60 °, 65 ° and 70 ° over a non-dimensional speed range of 0. 833 - 1. 667. The tests have been carried out with a permanent magnet eddy current dynamometer within a velocity ratio range of 0. 47 to 1. 09. The optimum efficiency of the variable geometry turbine was found to be approximately 5 percentage points higher than the baseline nozzleless unit. The peak efficiency of the variable geometry turbine corresponds to vane angle settings between 60 ° and 65 °, for both the lean and straight vanes. The maximum total-to-static efficiency of the turbine with lean vanes configuration was measured to be 79. 8 % at a velocity ratio of 0. 675. The equivalent value with straight vanes configuration is 80. 4 % at a velocity ratio of 0. 673. The swallowing capacity of the turbine was shown to increase with the lean vanes, as much as 17 % at 70 ° vane angle and pressure ratio of 1. 7. The turbine pulsating flow performance is presented for 50 % and 80 % equivalent speed conditions and a pulse frequency range of 20 - 80 Hz, these frequencies correspond to an engine speed range of 800 - 3200 RPM respectively. The turbine was observed to go through a period of choking within a pulse for vane angle settings between 60 ° - 70 °. The unsteady efficiency of a nozzled turbine was found to exhibit larger deviation from the quasi-steady curve compared to a nozzlesless turbine, by as much as - 19. 4 percentage points. This behaviour was found to be more pronounced towards the close nozzle settings, where the blockage effect is dominant. The nozzle ring was also shown to act as a “restrictor” which shields the turbine rotor from being completely exposed to the unsteadiness of the flow. This coupled with the phase shifting ambiguity was shown to result in the inaccuracy of the point-by-point instantaneous efficiency; where as much as 25 % of a cycle exhibits instantaneous efficiency above unity. Finally the turbine was tested by adapting to the pulsating flow (20 - 60 Hz) by cyclic variation in the opening and closing of the nozzle vanes, called Active Control Turbocharger (A. C. T.). The nozzle vane operating schedules for each pulse period were evaluated experimentally in two general modes; natural oscillating opening/closing of the nozzle vanes due to the pulsating flow and the forced sinusoidal oscillation of the vanes to match the incoming pulsating flow. The spring stiffness was found to be a dominant factor in the effectiveness of the natural oscillation mode. In the best setting, the turbine energy extraction was shown to improve by 6. 1 % over a cycle for the 20 Hz flow condition. In overall it was demonstrated an optimum A. C. T. operating condition could be achieved by allowing the nozzle ring to oscillate naturally in pulsating flow, against an external spring pre-load, which eliminates the use of complex mechanism and external drive. However, the current result suggest the benefits of A. C. T. are best realised in large low speed engines. Open Acces...|$|E

40|$|Effective {{similarity}} search indexing {{in general}} metric spaces has traditionally received special attention {{in several areas}} of interest like pattern recognition, computer vision or information retrieval. A typical method {{is based on the}} use of a distance as a dissimilarity function (not restricting to Euclidean distance) where the main objective is to speed up the search of the most similar object in a database by minimising the number of distance computations. Several types of search can be defined, being the k-nearest neighbour or the range search the most common. AESA {{is one of the most}} well known of such algorithms due to its performance (measured in distance computations). PiAESA is an AESA variant where the main objective has changed. Instead of trying to find the best nearest neighbour candidate at each step, it tries to find the object that contributes the most to have a bigger lower bound function, that is, a better estimation of the distance. In this paper we extend and test PiAESA to support several similarity queries. Our empirical results show that this approach obtains a significant improvement in performance when comparing with competing algorithms.

40|$|In {{the midst}} of {{heightened}} territorial tensions in Asia and lack of transparency within Beijing’s policymaking machine, analysts draw conclusions from China’s response to the US ‘pivot’ at their peril. The volume of Western supposition regarding China’s response to the US pivot vastly overshadows analyses of actual responses from Chinese sources. Studying official Chinese commentary and media coverage on US activity in Asia from November 2011 to January 2013 reveals three major trends. The tone in Chinese reportage on the US <b>pivot</b> <b>ranges</b> from a more moderate discourse from official sources {{to higher levels of}} alarm across state‑sponsored media. The media coverage of the US–Japan alliance or US engagement in ASEAN generally displays a high degree of nationalistic intensity, particularly when compared to the largely moderate Chinese reactions to Australia–US Marine and Air Force cooperation. US involvement in the South China Sea disputes and the US–Japan alliance in the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands dispute have also elicited strong nationalistic responses in the media. A common theme of containment was recorded across all sources: the bulk of Chinese commentary on US Asia–Pacific policy is a response to the destabilising effect of what is perceived as a ‘Cold War’‑style encirclement of China. US Asia–Pacific foreign policy is discussed widely and actively in China. Understanding the nuances of China’s differentiated response from the time of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s 2011 ‘America’s Pacific Century’ essay in Foreign Policy magazine is important: it makes us examine the accuracy of Western perceptions of China’s ‘stance’ on US foreign policy in the Asia– Pacific. Doing so provides greater depth to analyses of the narratives and strategic culture of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Greater insight into foreign policy and decision-making in China is useful to regional stakeholders, even if the evidence does not always provide for lucid conclusions...|$|R
50|$|The Multilift MPH (Military <b>Pivoting</b> Hooklift) <b>range</b> {{is based}} around commercially proven technologies, the overall system {{performance}} being improved by enhancing below ground {{pick up and}} the ability to load misaligned flatracks, both important military operational requirements. The complete system is designed to be used in all operational conditions, including darkness or while wearing nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) protective equipment. An automatic, fully sequenced control system mounted in the cab aids operational safety and maximises speed, even under battle conditions. The MPH range was designed and optimised to load, transport and unload flatracks conforming to the NATO standard (STANAG 2413). Flatracks can be pre-loaded at base with any military payload ready for dispersal to the required location. Payloads such as MLRS rockets, light armoured vehicles and command/control shelters can also be transported by using purpose-built flatracks with the correct locking systems built in.|$|R

We will also implement and experiment using a multi-threaded execution environment running on several processors. </p...|$|R
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{refers to}} a vertical axis hydraulic turbine to exploit energy from marine tidal currents or river streams, converting it into electric energy. The vertical axis hydraulic turbine {{is characterized by a}} rotor equipped with three blades each of which is pivotally connected on the rotor. During the revolution the blades are able to <b>pivot</b> within a <b>range</b> from 80 to 90 deg. with respect to the radial direction of the rotor. This variable pitch system for the blades is obtained through a self-acting system, based on the equilibrium obtained between centrifugal forces and hydrodynamic forces on the blade and the pitch blade range is limited by two stops placed opportunely. Through the blade pitch, the turbine is characterized by high torques that allow spontaneous starting without the need of an ignition device. The prototype of this turbine, named KOBOLD turbine, has been installed under a floating platform in 2002 in Messina strait within the ENERMAR project. The first turbine was characterized by a diameter of 5 m and a blade height of 5 m. The turbine, was rated at about 100 kW power with a current speed of 3, 0 m/s. UNIDO (United Nations Industrial Developments Organisation) has chosen the Kobold technology for the electrification of developing countries in a program that foresees the installation of three pilot plants in Southeast Asia.

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} whether double-bundle {{anterior cruciate ligament}} reconstruction leads to better restoration of anterior and rotational laxity and range of motion than single-bundle reconstruction. Methods: A search was performed in the Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases. All randomized, quasi-randomized, and observational clinical trials that reported the outcome of double-versus single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction were included in our meta-analysis. The primary outcomes were anterior laxity (KT arthrometer; MEDmetric, San Diego, CA), <b>pivot</b> shift, and <b>range</b> of motion. Subgroup analyses were performed for more than 2 years' follow-up, anatomic reconstruction, and nonanatomic reconstruction. The quality of the included studies was scored by use of the GRADE Checklist. Results: Included 12 studies in this meta-analysis, 5 of which were randomized. There was {{a statistically significant difference}} in favor of double-bundle reconstruction for anterior laxity (KT arthrometer difference, - 0. 6 mm), Lachman test (64 % risk reduction of positive Lachman), and pivot-shift test (69 % risk reduction of positive shift). Similar results were found for the subgroup with more than 2 years' follow-up and anatomic reconstructions. There were no significant differences for the subgroup with nonanatomic reconstructions, except a 2. 6 times risk increase of extension deficit with nonanatomic double-bundle reconstruction compared with nonanatomic single-bundle reconstruction. Most of the included studies were found to have at least one serious limitation in study design. Conclusions: In comparison with single-bundle reconstruction, double-bundle reconstruction showed less anterior laxity, as measured by the KT arthrometer and Lachman test, and better rotational laxity, as measured by the pivot-shift test. The majority of the included studies had at least one major limitation in study design that decreased the quality of the study. Level of Evidence: Level I, meta-analysi...|$|R
40|$|We have {{analyzed}} Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) data of {{the neutron}} star transient Aquila X- 1 obtained during its outbursts in May/June 1999 and September/October 2000. We find {{that in the early}} rise of these outbursts, a hard flare in the energy range above 15 keV preceded the soft X-ray peak. The hard X-ray flux of the hard flares at maximum was more than a factor of three stronger than at any other point in the outbursts. The rise of the hard X-ray flare to this maximum, was consistent with a monotonically brightening low/hard state spectrum. After the peak of the hard flare, a sharp spectral transition occurred with spectral <b>pivoting</b> in the <b>range</b> 8 – 12 keV. Our timing analysis shows that during the hard flare the power spectra were mainly composed of band-limited noise and a ∼ 1 – 20 Hz QPO, which correlate in frequency. Immediately after the hard flare, the power spectra turned into power law noise. The spectral and timing properties during and after the hard flares are very similar to those in black hole transients during the early rise of an outburst. We suggest that these hard flares and spectral transitions in Aql X- 1 are of the same origin as those observed in black hole transients. This leads to the association of the 1 – 20 Hz QPOs and band-limited noise in Aql X- 1 with those in black hole transients. We discuss the impact of this discovery on our understanding of soft X-ray transient outbursts, state transitions and variability in X-ray binaries.

40|$|Turbochargers {{are widely}} used in both {{passenger}} and commercial vehicle applications to increase power density, improved fuel economy leading to significant emissions reductions. In recent years, car manufacturers have introduced turbochargers widely in the diesel market {{in response to the}} stricter regulations in exhaust emissions. Although investment in turbocharger technology has made it possible to overcome issues related to reliability and cost, research is much needed in the area of design, testing methodologies and model development. This is particularly the case when considering unsteady flow effects. Computational codes are used by engine manufacturers to predict its performance and size components; prediction accuracy is crucial in this process. This thesis contributes to this process in several ways: steady modelling and heat transfer predictions. Furthermore, most aero-thermal design and analysis codes need data for validation; often the data available falls outside the range of conditions the engine experiences in reality leading to the need to interpolate and extrapolate excessively. The current work also contributes to this area by providing extensive experimental data in a large range of conditions. A further contribution of this work is the understanding of the turbine performance under pulsating flow; it shows that this performance deviates from the commonly used quasi-steady assumption in turbocharger/engine matching. A turbocharger is subjected to high temperature conditions; heat transfer within the turbine and the compressor severely affects the compressor performance at low rotational speeds and mass flow rates. Compressor maps provided by turbocharger manufacturers do not usually take into account the effects of heat transfer; this causes a mismatch when fitting the maps into engine codes which is detrimental to the overall engine performance prediction. The experimental investigation was conducted on three different turbine designs for an automotive turbocharger. The design progression was based on a commercial nozzleless unit modified into a variable geometry single as well as a twin-entry turbine configuration. The main geometrical parameters of these turbines were kept constant to allow equivalent performance assessment. The mixed-flow rotor used in this study consists of 12 blades with a constant inlet blade angle of + 20 °, a cone angle of 50 ° and a tip diameter of 95. 2 mm. The variable geometry stator consists of 15 vanes fitted into a ring mechanism, capable of <b>pivoting</b> in the <b>range</b> of 40 ° and 80 ° (with reference to the radial direction). The design progression into twin-entry turbine was completed by fitting a divider (accounting for only ≈ 6 % of the overall internal volume) within volute. The turbine response for different vane angles (40 ° to 70 °) and mass flow ratios between the two entries of the turbine was assessed. The turbine was tested under steady and pulsating flow conditions for two rotational speeds, 27. 9 rev/s·√K and 43. 0 rev/s·√K, a velocity ratio (U 2 /Cis) of 0. 3 - 1. 1 and a pulse frequency of 40 - 80 Hz under both in-phase and out-of-phase conditions. A meanline aerodynamic model capable of predicting the performance parameters was developed for the nozzleless and the variable geometry single-entry turbine. The former was validated against experimental results spanning an equivalent speed range of 27. 9 rev/s·√K and 53. 8 rev/s·√K while the latter validated against one single speed (43. 0 rev/s·√K) and three different vane angle settings (40 °, 60 ° and 70 °). The wide range of tests data from the Imperial College High Speed Dynamometer enabled the evaluation of the model in areas of the maps where currently no data exists. Based on the model prediction, a breakdown aerodynamic loss analysis was performed. As for the twin-entry turbine, the interaction between the two entries was investigated. Based on experimental evidence, a map-based method was developed to uniquely correlate the flow capacity within the entries for both partial and unequal admission. An investigation into the effects of heat transfer on a turbocharger was performed using a commercial turbocharger mounted on a 2. 0 litre diesel engine. The global objective of these tests was to improve the understanding of heat transfer in turbochargers under realistic engine conditions. Measurements were obtained for engine speeds between 1000 and 3000 rpm at a step of 500 rpm – for each engine speed the load applied was varied from 16 to 250 Nm. In addition to the standard set of measurements needed to define the turbo operating point, the turbocharger was equipped with 17 thermocouples positioned in different locations in order to quantify the temperatures of the components constituting the turbocharger. A simplified 1 -D heat transfer model was also developed and compared with experimental measurements. The algorithms calculate the heat transferred through the turbocharger, from the hot to the cold end by means of lump capacitances. The compressor performance deterioration from the adiabatic map was then predicted and based on the data generated by the model a multiple regression analysis was developed in order to assess the main parameters affecting the compressor non-adiabatic performance.
