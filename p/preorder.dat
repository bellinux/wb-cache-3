40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} {{construction}} of <b>preorders</b> on Set-monads by the semantic ⊤⊤-lifting. We show the universal property of this construction, and characterise the class of <b>preorders</b> on a monad as a limit of a Cardop-chain. We apply these theoretical results to identifying <b>preorders</b> on some concrete monads, including the powerset monad, maybe monad, and their composite monad. We also relate {{the construction of}} <b>preorders</b> and coalgebraic formulation of simulations. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we present logical {{characterizations}} of two <b>preorders,</b> {{within the framework}} of Hennessy-Milner Logics. The two <b>preorders</b> (loosely termed bisimulation-based efficiency <b>preorders)</b> are on processes represented as labelled transition systems. The characterizations are particularly interesting as they explore <b>preorders</b> lying between strong and weak bisimilarity, guided by a principle of containment which is explained in the Introduction. Even though the proofs of the characterizations use standard methods, there are various subtleties introduced {{by the nature of the}} <b>preorders</b> and the logical operators needed to characterize them.

40|$|AbstractIn {{previous}} papers, {{the notions}} of “closedness” and “strong closedness” in set-based topological categories were introduced. In this paper, we give the characterization of closed and strongly closed subobjects of an object in the category Prord of <b>preordered</b> sets and show that they form appropriate closure operators which enjoy the basic properties like idempotency (weak) hereditariness, and productivity. We investigate the relationships between these closure operators and the well-known ones, the up- and down-closures. As a consequence, we characterize each of T 0, T 1, and T 2 <b>preordered</b> sets and show {{that each of the}} full subcategories of each of T 0, T 1, T 2 <b>preordered</b> sets is quotient-reflective in Prord. Furthermore, we give the characterization of each of pre-Hausdorff <b>preordered</b> sets and zero-dimensional <b>preordered</b> sets, and show that there is an isomorphism of the full subcategory of zero-dimensional <b>preordered</b> sets and the full subcategory of pre-Hausdorff <b>preordered</b> sets. Finally, we show that both of these subcategories are bireflective in Prord...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMost {{of belief}} {{revision}} operations {{have been proposed}} for totally preordrered information. However, in case of partial ignorance, pieces of information are partially <b>preordered</b> and few effective approaches of revision have been proposed. The paper presents a new framework for revising partially <b>preordered</b> information, called Partially <b>Preordered</b> Removed Sets Revision (PPRSR). The notion of removed set, initially defined {{in the context of}} the revision of non ordered or totally <b>preordered</b> information is extended to partial <b>preorders.</b> The removed sets are efficiently computed thanks to a suitable encoding of the revision problem into logic programming with answer set semantics. This framework captures the possibilistic revision of partially <b>preordered</b> information and allows for implementing it with ASP. Finally, it shows how PPRSR can be applied to a real application of the VENUS european project...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} testing <b>preorders</b> for real-time communicating processes with "time-out" as {{the time}} constraint primitive where the time domain is the real numbers. The testing <b>preorders</b> presented here are {{a natural extension of}} De Nicola and Hennessy's for untimed communicating processes. We give fully abstract characterizations of the testing <b>preorders</b> in order to ease a proof by focusing the "essential pattern" of tests to establish the <b>preorders.</b> Next, by applying Holmer-Larsen-Wang's "symbolic" method to our <b>preorders,</b> we give the symbolic alternative characterizations where we treat time intervals instead of time itself. For the regular class of real-time, since timeout points are finitely represented, these symbolic characterizations give a proof technique for the testing <b>preorders.</b> Finally, we illustrate our proof technique by some examples. 1 Introduction Recently the communicating process model has been extended so that it can deal with the "timed" behavior.
