When people ask me which E.T. they should look at, I always tell them to look at the original 1982 E.T. If you notice, when we did put out E.T. we put out two E.T.s. We put out the digitally enhanced version with the additional scenes and for no extra money, in the same package, we put out the original '82 version.

5|$|During the 18th century, {{the street}} {{began to be}} popular with the bourgeoisie living around Mayfair. Shop owners let out their upper storeys for {{residential}} purposes, attracting lodgers such as Jonathan Swift, George Selwyn, William Pitt the Elder and Laurence Sterne. In 1784, Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire, an active socialite, demanded that people boycott Covent Garden as its residents had voted against Whig member of parliament Charles James Fox. This had caused him to lose his seat in parliament, leading to {{the dissolution of the}} Fox–North Coalition. She insisted people should look for nearer shopping streets, and encouraged <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Bond Street. Consequently, the street became a retail area for people living in Mayfair. By the end of the century, an upper-class social group known as the Bond Street Loungers had appeared, wearing expensive wigs and parading {{up and down the street}} in a pretentious manner.|$|E

[...] For a short period after their marriage, Clarence and Grace Hemingway lived at first with Grace's father, Ernest Hall, their first son's namesake. Later, Ernest Hemingway would say that he disliked his name, which he [...] "associated with the naive, even foolish hero of Oscar Wilde's play The Importance of Being Earnest".

500|$|A {{number of}} {{accounts}} in apocryphal literature {{built on the}} accounts of the crucifixion darkness. The Gospel of Peter, probably from the second century, expanded on the canonical gospel accounts in creative ways. As one writer puts it, [...] "accompanying miracles become more fabulous and the apocalyptic portents are more vivid". In this version, the darkness which covers the whole of Judaea leads <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> about with lamps believing it to be night. The fourth century Gospel of Nicodemus describes how Pilate {{and his wife are}} disturbed by a report of what had happened, and the Judeans he has summoned tell him it was an ordinary solar eclipse. Another text from the fourth century, the purported Report of Pontius Pilate to Tiberius, claimed the darkness had started at the sixth hour, covered the whole world, and during the subsequent evening the full moon resembled blood for the entire night. In a fifth- or sixth-century text by Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, the author claims to have observed a solar eclipse from Heliopolis {{at the time of the}} crucifixion.|$|E

The film was heavily promoted in an episode of the Fox Network series Bones in the episode [...] "The Gamer In The Grease" [...] (Season 5, Episode 9). Avatar star Joel David Moore has a recurring role on the program, and is seen in the episode anxiously awaiting the release of the film. A week prior to the American release, Zoe Saldana promoted the film on Adult Swim when she was interviewed by an animated Space Ghost.

500|$|The album's lead single, [...] "Tango del Pecado", is {{addressed}} {{to the parents of}} Residente's then-girlfriend, former Miss Universe Denise Quiñones, who did not approve of the couple's relationship. [...] He explains that the song expresses how he will still date her regardless of their opinions, and author Ed Morales observes that [...] "It's a calling out of the morality of Latin America. [...] It's just an invitation to turn everything upside-down by embracing the ugly and profane in life and, you know, asking <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on that journey." [...] "Tango del Pecado" [...] also created controversy due to the repeated chanting of [...] "Súbele el volumen a la música satánica" [...] (turn up the satanic music). [...] Residente asserts that he did not add the line to create a reaction, saying, [...] "I never do something expecting something. I do things because I like them." [...] "El Avión Se Cae" [...] depicts the thoughts of a drunken airplane passenger. In [...] "Pal Norte", Residente discusses the plight of immigrants in the United States. [...] Commenting on the track's lyrical themes, he explained [...] "I had wanted to do that theme because I think it is an important topic. And not just for the immigrants in the United States but all over. It is a song that immigrants can identify with, Dominicans as well as Puerto Ricans. All the people leave one country for another for the same reasons." [...] Although much of the album addresses immigration and moving to different countries, [...] "La Crema" [...] is a celebration of living in Puerto Rico.|$|E
