40|$|This paper uses an {{aggregate}} modelling approach {{to assess the}} impact of taxes in refined-petroleum products on the Philippine's economy. The approach used in the analysis consists of a general equilibrium model composed of 14 producing sectors, 14 consuming sectors, three household categories classified by income, and a government. The effects of removing the 48 % tax on premium and regular gasoline and the 24 % tax on other refined petroleum products on prices and quantities are examined. The results are revealing. For example, the consequences of a complete elimination of refined petroleum product taxes would be an increase in output by all producing sectors of about 3 Â· 7 % or about 2 Â· 65 hundred billion (2 Â· 65 x 1011) <b>Philippine</b> <b>pesos,</b> a rise in the consumption of goods and services by about 13 Â· 6 % or 4 Â· 2 hundred billion (4 Â· 2 x 1011) <b>Philippine</b> <b>pesos,</b> a rise in total utility by 14 Â· 3 % or 4 Â· 5 hundred billion (4 Â· 5 x 1011) <b>Philippine</b> <b>pesos</b> and a lower tax revenue for the government of 62 Â· 4 % or 2 Â· 8 hundred billion (2 Â· 8 x 1011) <b>Philippine</b> <b>pesos.</b> When subjected to a sensitivity analysis, the results are reasonably robust with regard to the assumption of the values of the substitution elasticities.
