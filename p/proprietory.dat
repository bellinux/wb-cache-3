60|$|It {{was only}} as the nineteenth century {{developed}} that men {{began to realize that}} property was not one simple thing, but a great complex of ownerships of different values and consequences, that many things (such as one's body, the implements of an artist, clothing, toothbrushes) are very profoundly and incurably one's personal property, {{and that there is a}} very great range of things, railways, machinery of various sorts, homes, cultivated gardens, pleasure boats, for example, which need each to be considered very particularly to determine how far and under what limitations it may come under private ownership, and how far it falls into the public domain and may be administered and let out by the state in the collective interest. On the practical side these questions pass into politics, and the problem of making and sustaining efficient state administration. They open up issues in social psychology, and interact with the enquiries of educational science. The criticism of property is still a vast and passionate ferment rather than a science. On the one hand are the Individualists, who would protect and enlarge our present freedoms with what we possess, and on the other the Socialists who would in many directions pool our ownerships and restrain our <b>proprietory</b> acts. In practice one will find every gradation between the extreme individualist, who will scarcely tolerate a tax of any sort to support a government, and the communist who would deny any possessions at all. The ordinary socialist of to-day is what is called a collectivist; he would allow a considerable amount of private property but put such affairs as education, transport, mines, land-owning, most mass productions of staple articles, and the like, into the hands of a highly organized state. Nowadays there does seem to be a gradual convergence of reasonable men towards a moderate socialism scientifically studied and planned. It is realized more and more clearly that the untutored man does not co-operate easily and successfully in large undertakings, and that every step towards a more complex state and every function that the state takes over from private enterprise, necessitates a corresponding educational advance and the organization of a proper criticism and control. Both the press and the political methods of the contemporary state are far too crude for any large extension of collective activities.|$|E
60|$|But we {{had only}} that one day there, and in our haste {{to give it to}} the regatta we could only make sure of driving over a {{beautiful}} picture- postal bridge {{on our way to the}} meadows by whose brink our college barge was moored, and making believe to tug at its chain. It was really doing nothing of the kind, for it was familiar with boat-racing in the Thames where the Thames is still the Isis at Oxford, and was as wholly without the motive as without the fact of impatience. Like many other barges and house-boats set broadside to the shore for a mile up and down as closely as they could be lined, it was of a comfortable cabin below and of a pleasant gallery above, with an awning to keep off the sun or rain, whichever it might be the whim of the weather to send. But that day the weather had no whims; it was its pleasure to be neither wet nor hot, but of a delicious average warmth, informed with a cool freshness which had the days of the years of youth in it. In fact, youth came back in all the holiday sights and scents to the elderly witness who ought to have known better than to be glad of such things as the white tents in the green meadows, the gypsy fires burning pale in the sunlight by the gypsy camps, the traps and carriages thronging up and down the road, or standing detached from the horses in the wayside shadow, where the trodden grass, not less nor more than the wandering cigar-whiff, exhaled the memories of far-off circus-days and Fourths of July. But such things lift the heart in spite of philosophy and experience, and bid it rejoice in the relish of novelty which a scene everywhere elementally the same offers in slight idiosyncrasies of time and place. Certain of these might well touch the American half-brother with a sense of difference, but there was none that perhaps more suggested it than the frank English proclamation by sign-board that these or those grounds in the meadows were this or that lady's, who might be supposed waiting in <b>proprietory</b> state for her guests within the pavilion of her roped-off enclosure. Together with this assertion of private right, and the warning it implied, was the expression of yet elder privilege in the presence of the immemorial wanderers who had their shabby camps by the open wayside and offered the passer fortune at so low a rate that the poorest pleasurer could afford to buy a prophecy of prosperity from them; I do not know why they proposed to sell with these favorable destinies small brushes and brooms of their own make.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A novel {{reliability}} analysis technique {{is presented to}} estimate the reli-ability of real structural systems. Its unique feature is that the dynamic loadings can be applied in time domain. It is a nonlinear stochastic finite element logarithm combined with the response surface method (RSM). It generates the response sur-face around the most probable failure point and incorporates information {{of the distribution of}} the random variables in the RSM formulation. It is verified using the Monte Carlo simulation technique, and is found to be very efficient and accurate. Most sources of nonlinearlity and uncertainty can be explicitly incorporated in the formulation. The flexibility of connections, represented by moment-relative rota-tion (M–θ) curves, is addressed. After the Northridge earthquake of 1994, several improved steel connections were proposed. Structural Sesimic Design Associates (SSDA) tested several full-scale <b>proprietory</b> slotted web beam–column connec-tions. The authors suggested (M–θ) curves for this connection using actual test data. Behaviours of steel frames, assuming the connections are fully restrained, partially restrained, consisting of pre- and post-Northridge connections are evaluated and compared. Desirable features of the post-Northridge connections observed during testing are analytically confirmed. Laterally weak steel frame is then strengthened with concrete shear walls. Capabilities and the advanced nature of the method are demonstrated with the help of realistic examples...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} part of a case study of recent and {{contemporary}} changes in rural Luq economy and society in Kisumu District of Kenya. It examines in particular the productive role of women in regard to changing patterns in access to land, land use and subsistence agriculture. The central issue discussed in the paper is women's land rights in relation to those of men. Special attention is focussed on the land reform programme whose implementation is nearing completion in the district and its impact on access rights of women and men in land. It is pointed out that the transfer (or intention to transfer) of the final right to dispose of land from a communal (lineage) to an individual basis has two structural consequences. First it creates a new legal basis for the control of the individual over resources especially because land is the basis of rural livelihood in the area. Second in so far as the registered title holders are mainly men the programme merely modernises the <b>proprietory</b> control over women by men. More specifically it is pointed-out that weakening of women's usufructory rights by the programme is likely to be more disadvantageous for childless women, women with only daughters and widows in the latter category...|$|E

The removal of loosely bound or weakly adsorbed contamination from surfaces can usually be achieved using conventional cleaning methods such as solvents or <b>proprietory</b> aqueous-based cleaning solutions. However, the removal of fully crosslinked material which might be strongly adsorbed or chemisorbed onto surfaces, such as paints or adhesives, presents a much greater challenge. Similarly, residual epoxide resins remaining on the inside surfaces of resin transfer mould (RTM) tooling post curing are strongly adhered to the mould surface and need to be removed so that the mould can be reused. The mould materials are typically steel or nickel but may be compositebased. Conventional methods cannot fully remove residual epoxide material without the use of hazardous chemicals and mechanical removal can easily result in damage to the underlying mould which may compromise its reuse.

40|$|Abstract Background The most {{efficient}} method for enhancing solubility of recombinant proteins appears {{to use the}} fusion expression partners. Although commercial fusion partners including maltose binding protein and glutathione- S -transferase have shown good performance in enhancing the solubility, they cannot {{be used for the}} <b>proprietory</b> production of commercially value-added proteins and likely cannot serve as universal helpers to solve all protein solubility and folding issues. Thus, novel fusion partners will continue to be developed through systematic investigations including proteome mining presented in this study. Results We analyzed the Escherichia coli proteome response to the exogenous stress of guanidine hydrochloride using 2 -dimensional gel electrophoresis and found that RpoS (RNA polymerase sigma factor) was significantly stress responsive. While under the stress condition the total number of soluble proteins decreased by about 7 %, but a 6 -fold increase in the level of RpoS was observed, indicating that RpoS is a stress-induced protein. As an N-terminus fusion expression partner, RpoS increased significantly the solubility of many aggregation-prone heterologous proteins in E. coli cytoplasm, indicating that RpoS is a very effective solubility enhancer for the synthesis of many recombinant proteins. RpoS was also well suited for the production of a biologically active fusion mutant of Pseudomonas putida cutinase. Conclusion RpoS is highly effective as a strong solubility enhancer for aggregation-prone heterologous proteins when it is used as a fusion expression partner in an E. coli expression system. The results of these findings may, therefore, be useful in the production of other biologically active industrial enzymes, as successfully demonstrated by cutinase. </p...|$|E

We manipulate the cost of link formation in different treatments. Our data almost perfectly match the predictions for both stages whenever the link formation costs are extreme and the predicted networks symmetric (empty or complete networks). In the case of intermediate link formation costs where the predicted networks are asymmetric, subjects rarely form asymmetric networks. When they do, observed and predicted quantities are less in accordance than for symmetric networks. Collusion cannot account for the observed behavior. In our second experiment we reject the conjecture that these findings are driven out by experience in a setting in which we increase the implemented number of repetitions of the two-stage game. Finally, in our third experiment we reduce the complexity of the setting by transforming the original two-stage game into a one-stage game where the formation of inter-firm networks directly determines firms’ payoffs. These are derived from assumed equilibrium market outputs on the here absent competition stage. In this case, observed networks coincide with the predicted ones indicating that experimental subjects’ limited capacity to foresee the outcomes of the market stage may be driving the earlier discrepancies.

40|$|Benefits {{and costs}} of {{implementing}} the specialized grazing systems on federal rangelands managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) were studied. First only the direct benefits and costs {{were used to determine}} the internal rates of return on the Bureau of of Land Management investments in grazing systems. Secondly, the effects of theses systems on profits of private ranchers were determined. Finally the benefits and costs stream on the Bureau of Land Management and the changes in ranchers 2 ̆ 7 profits were brought together to find out the net gain to society from investing the federal funds in specialized grazing systems. The internal rate of return on the Bureau of Land Management investments over an area of approximately 695, 024 acres in Idaho, Nevada and Utah is 2. 37 percent which is less than half the rate federal investments are expected to return (as measured by the federal government 2 ̆ 7 s cost of borrowing). More than half of the twenty four allotment plans have negative rates of return. Out of thirteen plans with negative rates of return only five had positive net returns and the rest have negative net returns. Specialized grazing systems have improved the aggregate profits of the private ranchers by 3. 06 for each pound of livestock produced. Federal investment in specialized grazing systems may be justified if income distribution is considered a valid reason for such activities. If the stability and continuity of their operations is assured, ranchers may be able to pay increased grazing fees. In {{view of the fact that}} under public pressure the government has decided to withdraw rancher benefits in the form of grazing fees lower than market rates, income distribution appears to be poor grounds for justification of federal investment. Also, given the income benefits to ranch operations, ranchers themselves would undoubtedly want to invest in grazing systems on federal land. However, rancher investment is unlikely since the Bureau of Land Management is already discouraging private permanent improvements on public lands. From the point of view of the Bureau of Land Management as a <b>proprietory</b> agent, the real cost of obtaining an increase of a bundle of non-grazing benefits produced jointly with an animal unit month of increased forage production is 0. 53. A grazing fee of 1. 74 per animal unit month would be required for the Bureau of Land Management to break even on investments in grazing systems. This is in spirt of the fact that large federal investments in necessary range improvements already existed before the implementation of the specialized grazing systems. It appears the investments in grazing systems on unimproved ranges are not justifiable in terms of direct returns to the Bureau of Land Management. If the externality to the ranching segment of society is internalized, specialized grazing systems more than pay for themselves if future benefits are discounted at the public discount rate. Besides the positive change in public goods, society gains 3. 42 for each additional animal unit month of grazing. Many questions are left unanswered such as quantifying and placing a dollar value on rangeland benefits claimed by the federal agencies...|$|E
40|$|DustScan is {{a passive}} (i. e. unpowered) dust {{sampling}} method. It uses a transparent adhesive ‘sticky pad’ to sample dust in flux and in deposition for subsequent image-based quantification and, as appropriate, geochemical analysis. Samples are obtained over typically 7 – 14 day intervals {{in the vicinity}} of industrial sites such as quarries, surface coal mines, landfill sites and construction and demolition sites. DustScan was developed at the University of Leeds (Farnfield and Birch, 1997) and refined at DustScan Ltd and the University of Leeds (Datson and Birch, 2006). Dedicated geochemical analysis methods of DustScan samples using ICP-AES and ICP-MS have been developed (Datson and Fowler, 2007) and their use in environmental forensics has been demonstrated by quantifying dust propagation at a hazardous waste landfill site (Fowler et al. 2010). However, wider environmental forensic applications of the method have been constrained largely by the impracticality of detaching the sampled dust from the collection media. Until recently, the sticky pads have been die-cut from sheets of a <b>proprietory</b> transparent PVC film with a permanent, cross-linked polymer-acrylic adhesive. Whilst this type of adhesive has excellent environmental dust sampling characteristics, its formulation renders it essentially insoluble (except in solvents that also dissolve much of the dust, e. g. HF). Furthermore, on retrieval after field sampling the sticky pads are sealed with a transparent film to facilitate handling and minimise contamination, thus making physical removal of dust at a later date difficult. Since the most effective means of dust ‘extraction’ from the sticky pads has been in solution and the image-based quantification method does not assess dust mass, geochemical data have been reported in terms of concentration in the extraction (e. g. ppm in solution) rather than in the dust (e. g. mg g- 1). Confidence in adequately low detection limits has also been compromised by variable concentrations of some metals (e. g. Zn, Ba) in the sampling media. Funding was obtained from the Finance South East Ltd (FSE) proof of concept (PoCKeT) fund to investigate alternative dust sampling media and, initially, to improve the elemental coverage and method detection limits. The project was carried out in conjunction between DustScan Ltd and the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences (SEES) at the University of Portsmouth. The new adhesive has similar transparency, tack and UV-resistance to the original but can be dissolved in an appropriate solvent. The new design has been tested in the field at a range of UK industrial sites as well as in a comprehensive bench testing programme. In the field trials, the new sampling media performed well in relation to the original sticky pads. Dust capture and retention were apparently similar and sample handling and processing for image analysis were satisfactory, although transparency was marginally less uniform. In the bench tests, both types of sticky pad were exposed to a known dust at different concentrations and wind speeds in an environmental wind tunnel. Correspondence between the sample media types was good to excellent in relation to the different image quantification methods applied. In addition, an array of elemental analysis tests was performed. NIST standard reference materials were applied to the new sticky pads, then extracted by dissolution of the adhesive and filtration onto 25 mm PTFE filter circles for ICP-MS analysis. Bulk dusts from a number of industrial sources were similarly applied, and analysed before and after application. An unanticipated benefit of the investigation has been the development of a practicable method to determine sampled dust mass in passive directional and deposited environmental dust samples, which has enabled reporting of mass/mass element concentrations in the dust samples after ICP-MS analysis...|$|E
