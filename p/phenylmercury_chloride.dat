40|$|In {{this study}} we report a method for direct vapor {{generation}} of mercury species on nano TiO 2 under UV irradiation {{in the presence of}} a formic acid and sodium formate mixture as a hole scavenger. A novelly designed UV/TiO 2 photocatalysis reaction device (UV/TiO 2 PCRD) was used as an effective sample introduction unit and an interface for mercury species determination by atomic fluorescence spectrometry (AFS) and speciation by HPLC-AFS for the first time. The detection limits of 10, 20, 30 and 70 pg mL(- 1) of mercury chloride, methylmercury chloride, ethylmercury chloride and <b>phenylmercury</b> <b>chloride,</b> respectively, were achieved by AFS using flow injection mode. Compared with the traditional KBH 4 /NaOH-HCl system, UV/TiO 2 PCRD is a superior alternative for online vapor generation of Hg species...|$|E
40|$|An {{automatic}} system, {{based on}} the on-line coupling of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation, post column microwave digestion, and cold-vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometry (CVAFS) detection, was proposed for the speciation analysis of four mercury compounds. Post column microwave digestion, {{in the presence of}} potassium persulfate (in HCl), was applied in the system to improve the conversion efficiency of three organic mercury compounds into inorganic mercury. Parameters influencing the on-line digestion efficiency and the separation effect were optimized. To avoid water vapor and methanol entering into the atomic fluorescence detector, ice-water mixture bath was used to cool the rnicrowave-digested sample solution. Four mercury species including inorganic mercury chloride (MC), methylmercury chloride (MMC), ethylmercury chloride (EMC) and <b>phenylmercury</b> <b>chloride</b> (PMC) were baseline separated within 13 min by using RP C 18 column with a mobile phase of 50 % (v/v) methanol containing 10 mmol 1 (- 1) tetrabutyl ammonium bromide and 0. 1 mol 1 (- 1) sodium chloride pumped at 1. 2 ml min(- 1). Seafood samples, composed of three gastropod species and two bivalve species from Yantai port, China, have been analyzed by the proposed method. Dogfish muscle (DORM- 2) was analyzed to verify the accuracy of the method and the result was in good agreement with the certified value. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B. V...|$|E
