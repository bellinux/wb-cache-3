40|$|Background: In {{diagnostic}} radiology lead apron, are usually {{used to protect}} patients and radiology staff against ionizing radiation. Lead apron is a desirable shield due to high absorption and effective attenuation of x-ray photons in the {{diagnostic radiology}} range. Objective: Although lead aprons have good radiation protection properties, in recent years, researchers {{have been looking for}} alternative materials to be used instead of lead apron because of some problems derived from lead-content of aprons. Because of its lead-content, these radiation <b>protection</b> <b>garments</b> are so heavy and uncomfortable for the staff to wear, particularly in long-time uses. In addition, lead is a toxic element and its disposal is associated with environmental and human-health hazards. Method: In this study, several new combinations of lead free materials ((W-Si), (W-Sn-Ba-EPVC), (W-Sn-Cd-EPVC)) have been investigated in the energy range of diagnostic radiology in two geometries: narrow and broad beam. Geometries of the radiation attenuation characteristics of these materials was assessed in 40, 60, 90 and 120 kVp and the results compared with those of some lead-containing materials ((Pb-Si), (Pb-EPVC)). Results: Lead shields still provide better protection in low energies (below 40 kVp). Combination of W-Sn-Cd-EPVC has shown the best radiation attenuation features in 60 and 90 kVp and the composition of (W-Sn-Ba-EPVC) represents the best attenuation in 120 kVp, even better than previously mentioned lead- containing composites.

The current Shuttle pneumatic Anti-G Suit or AGS at 25 mmHg (0. 5 psi) and customized medical mechanical compressive garments (20 - 30 mmHg) were tested on human subjects. The test process is presented. The preliminary results conclude that mechanical compressive garments can ameliorate orthostatic hypotension in hypovolemic subjects. A mechanical compressive garment is light, small and works without external pressure gas source; however the current garment design does not provide an adjustment {{to compensate for the}} loss of mass and size in the lower torso during long term space missions. It is also difficult to don. Compression garments that do not include an abdominal component are less effective countermeasures than garments which do.

Although both garments successfully countered hypovolemia-induced orthostatic intolerance, the Kentavr provided protection by using lower levels of compression pressure. This more recent study with a lower AGS pressure shows that pressures at 20 - 30 mmHg is acceptable but protection function is not as effective as higher pressure.

40|$|The {{excellence}} in quality of Biella wool fabric, provided {{from the last}} 40 years one of first position in {{all over the world}} for the "Biella textile district". In the last decade competition of developing countries became ruthless regarding the common textile like wool for a lot of reason, first of all cheaper labor. Industries started to move production over there but, fortunately, the know-how has remained here. For these reasons, since the past 10 years the world of textile, especially in Europe and USA, is moving to another kind of textile and garments dimension: the Technical Textile. Aramids are, since 90 's, the most important technical textile for <b>protection</b> <b>garments,</b> and in Biella district a lot of factories started to handle them. Since some factories started to produce yarn and fabric for protective garments, the need to dye them has come. The market nowadays requires, even for protective goods, not only the conventional coloration with which the fiber is produced in large scale by manufacturers, but all the typical color ranges of other common textile fibers. Nomex® fiber is probably the most important m-aramid used for this scope and its dyeing recipes are well known. However, Nomex® is not easily available for factories due to particular commercial agreements, and is very expensive. Other branded m-aramid fibers exist on the market having same technical properties of Nomex® but, unfortunately, not exactly the same dyeability. In 2010 a regional research project called FILIDEA was born between Politecnico di Torino and Marchi&Fildi Company. One of the 6 research working packages was thought to overcome the difficulties in dyeing a m-aramid fiber called X-Fiper® and produced by a Chinese company called SRO.

Thermal manikins offer an alternative to the ethics of human subject testing; however, some manikin results have disagreed in a recent round-robin test. The source of the inconsistency between manikins could be methodological or calibration. Inconsistent measurements dilute the argument for using manikins in place of human subjects. Since manikins are not mass-produced and a variety of designs are in use, a calibration tool is needed to make manikin data credible and prove equivalence to human subject testing. Calibration by means of a standard clothing set can demonstrate consistency among manikins but not absolute accuracy. To facilitate the calibration of manikins in many locations, there is need for a portable calibration system.

40|$|Purpose: To {{measure the}} {{attenuation}} effectiveness and minimize {{the weight of}} new non-Pb radiation shielding materials used for radiation protection by interventional radiology (IR) physicians, to compare {{the accuracy of the}} different standard measurement geometries of these materials, and to determine x-ray qualities that correspond to the scattered radiation that IR physicians typically encounter. Methods: Radiation attenuation capabilities of non-Pb materials were investigated. Typically, most studies of non-Pb materials have focused on the attenuating properties of metal powders. In this study, layers of materials incorporating non-Pb powdered compounds such as Bi 2 O 3, Gd 2 O 3, and BaSO 4 were measured individually, as bilayers, and as a Bi 2 O 3 -loaded hand cream. Attenuation measurements were performed in narrow-beam (fluorescence excluded) and broad beam (fluorescence included) geometries, demonstrating that these different geometries provided significantly different results. The Monte Carlo (MC) program EGSnrc was used to calculate the resulting spectra after attenuation by radiation shielding materials, and scattered x-ray spectra after 900 scattering of eight ASTM Standard primary x-ray beams. Surrogate x-ray qualities that corresponded to these scattered spectra were tabulated. Results: Radiation shielding materials incorporating Bi 2 O 3 were found to provide equivalent or superior attenuation compared with commercial Pb-based and non-Pb materials across the 60 - 130 kVp energy range. Measurements were made for single layers of the Bi 2 O 3 compound and for bilayers where the ordering was low atomic number (Z) layer closest to x-ray sourcehigh Z (Bi 2 O 3) layer farthest from the x-ray source. Narrow-beam Standard test methods which do not include the contribution from fluorescence overestimated the attenuating capabilities of Pb and non-Pb materials. Measurements of a newly developed, quick-drying, and easily removable Bi 2 O 3 -loaded hand cream demonstrated better attenuation capabilities than commercial Bi 2 O 3 -loaded gloves. Scattered radiation measurements and MC simulations illustrated that the spectra resulting from 900 scattering of primary x-ray beam qualities can be approximated by surrogate x-ray qualities which are more representative of the radiation actually encountered by IR physicians. A table of surrogate qualities of the eight ASTM F 2547 - 06 Standard qualities was compiled. Conclusions: New non-Pb compound materials, particularly single layers or bilayers incorporating Bi 2 O 3, can reduce the weight of radiation protection materials while providing equivalent or better protection compared to Pb-based materials. Attenuation measurements in geometries that exclude the contribution from fluorescence substantially underestimate the quantity of transmitted radiation. A new Bi 2 O 3 -loaded hand cream demonstrated a novel and effective approach for hand protection. Standard testing protocols for radiation protection materials used by IR physicians specify a wider kVp range than is necessary. A more realistic range would acknowledge the lower kVp resulting from scatter and allow IR physicians to confidently utilize lighter-weight materials while still receiving adequate protection.

The study investigates the validity of an assumption that there is a dearth in the product offerings of women’s protective wear that are ergonomically designed with a good fit, and offer acceptable levels of comfort for women performing outdoors in the construction industry. The research employs a qualitative research method – including interviews with key actors such as women working in the construction industry, and manufacturers. Pertinent psychological and physiological factors relating to the current protective wear are also interrogated herein. For example, the unique morphological features associated with steatopygia and gynaeoid body types are common in the sub-region, and yet not fully accommodated in the design of contextresponsive work wear. The prevailing attitudes among selected manufacturers and suppliers to motivate them to offer superior products for women in the construction industry are explored. A higher adoption rate of the redesigned women’s protective wear could correlate to reductions in downtime associated with general occupational health and safety issues; as well as an impact of low levels of comfort, <b>protection</b> and <b>garment</b> fit. Similarly, the redesigned garments could inform the development of improved protective wear for women, and ultimately facilitate higher productivity in the work environment. Subsequently, a boosted self-confidence and higher levels of motivation occasioned by a positive body image of women workers would validate the efficacy of the intended ergonomic design intervention. Lastly, the thesis discusses sociotechnical strategies for generating high fidelity data for applications in new product development for women’s protective wear. Furthermore, the findings and recommendations are discussed herein; this is made possible by the data collected...|$|R
40|$|NEW YORK (Reuters Health) Improvised {{explosive}} devices (IEDs) cause a far worse pattern of injury than conventional anti-personnel mines (APMs), {{a study by}} combat medics stationed in Afghanistan shows. “These weapons cause devastating injuries that necessitate lifelong care and treatment for these patients,” Dr. Shane Smith, a major in the Royal Canadian Medical Service based in London, Ontario, told Reuters Health by telephone. “They have multiple amputations as well as very significant pelvic injuries, and so these people will need support going forward. ”Conventional landmines were initially designed to “injure but not kill, to remove a target from combat and to increase the logistical burden for the enemy of caring for the casualty,” Dr. Smith and his team note in their report, published August 23 in BMJ Open. A person who steps on a landmine typically suffers traumatic amputation of the foot or leg, {{with one or more}} traumatic lower-limb amputations. After observing that injuries from IEDs seemed to be much more severe, Dr. Smith and his team prospectively characterized injuries in 100 consecutive pedestrian IED victims treated between January 2010 and July 2011 at the Multinational Medical Unit at Kandahar Air Field in Afghanistan. All patients were male, ranging in age from six to 44 years. Nine were younger than 18. Sixty-one were soldiers from the U. S., Canada or the UK; 27 were Afghan locals, and nationality was not recorded for the remaining 12. Of the IED victims, 70 % suffered multiple amputations, including five with quadruple amputations, 27 with triple amputations, and 38 with double amputations. In contrast, about 10 % of conventional landmine victims sustain multiple amputations. Genital injury occurred in 26 %, versus about 13 % of those injured by conventional APMs. Thirty-seven IED victims had at least one upper-extremity amputation, and 46 had perineal or gluteal injuries. Injuries were fatal in 19 patients. “The typical injury profile... included: bilateral lower extremity amputations (often above the knee); mangling or amputation of an upper extremity; extensive soft tissue injury with deep contamination by soil, extending into gluteal and perineal regions and pelvic ring disruption and genital mutilation,” the authors state. Given the observed injury patterns, Dr. Smith and his colleagues note, first responders to IED injuries should be prepared to apply tourniquets bilaterally and place pelvic binders to help reduce blood loss. “IEDs have a much more severe and significant injury pattern than industrially manufactured conventional landmines,” Dr. Jonathan Morrison, a trauma surgeon at the R. Adam Cowley Shock Trauma Center at the University of Maryland Medical System, told Reuters Health by telephone. Dr. Morrison deployed multiple times to Iraq and Afghanistan, but he did not participate in the new study. Since about 2011 - 2012, Dr. Morrison noted, coalition soldiers serving in Afghanistan have been issued perineal <b>protection</b> <b>garments</b> to shield them from blast injury. Also, he added, soldiers are now less likely to patrol on foot, and more likely to travel in armored mine-resistant vehicles specifically designed to deflect IED blasts. Lessons learned from treating IED injuries have been useful for civilian physicians caring for victims of shootings and terrorist attacks in the U. S., Dr. Morrison pointed out. The U. S. Department of Homeland Security’s Stop the Bleed campaign aims to give bystanders the skills to step in and treat trauma victims, he added. ([URL] concept of powerful improvised {{explosive devices}} is not new,” Dr. Morrison said, noting that the devices were used against U. S. soldiers in Vietnam, who rarely survived the events. “We are now much better at managing these sorts of injuries,” he said. “There is now a cohort of several hundred veterans who have a relatively unique set of injuries, and caring for them in five, 10, 20 years’ time is going to have some unique challenges that we’ve never encountered before. ”SOURCE: [URL] Open 2017.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{material}} aspects of the wood and metal workshop, which is one out of two learning settings in the Sloyd subject. Sloyd is a compulsory school subject in Sweden, which includes textile, wood and metal work. Historically, wood and metal Sloyd {{has been dominated by}} male pupils and teachers. The purpose of the thesis is to describe and analyse how the materialized masculinity of the wood and metal workshop is embodied by the pupils during class. The study concerns 41 observed lessons in three different workshops, during the period of 2011 - 2013. Six groups have been ob- served and the observations have been complemented with individual interviews, group interviews and one video recording. The study is conducted from a gender perspective, which considers sociomaterial structures {{to be a part of}} a gender structure. Following Raewyn Connell, Yvonne Hirdman and others, the gender structure of the sociomaterial wood and metal workshop is brought to light. But the main focus lies on the embodied phenomena of the sociomaterial structure. This is applied through a hermeneutical phenomenological methodology, where the main analytical tools have been ”the corporeal turn” as presented by Maxine Sheets-Johnstone, ”the lived body” as Merleau-Ponty describes it, and Young’s interpretation of”situatedness” in feminist phenomenology. As regards the results, an overarching structuralistic analysis of pupils’ expectancies and be- haviours in the setting, along with historical documents, show that the wood and metal workshop holds a strong material classification in school. It is geographically peripheral and resembles the workshops of the industry outside school, rather than classrooms inside school. The workshop also has a strong inner classification, where the metal room is classified as the most masculine place in the workshop, and the painting room and the workbench are classified as being weak in masculinity. Analysis shows that the materiality close to the skin (caps, dirt, <b>protection</b> gear and <b>garments)</b> is embodied both as an ex- pression or a visual sign for others, but also as a tactile immanence or non- visual objectification of the body. Analysis also shows that the materiality in contact with the hand of- ten has an elongated form. The common use of elongated objects (wagging, fencing, poking, crafting) in the Sloyd groups are described as a consequence of historical views on masculine movements and transcendence by the founders of male (wood and metal) Sloyd. Furthermore, the processing of the common three-dimensional materials are analysed as "inside", as a non-visual kinetic-kinaesthetic experience that lessens the visual objectification of the body. Beyond the reach of the hand, the three- dimensional, silent and personal artefacts render specific intersubjective situations. The space of the workshop is considered performative, using the silent and three-dimensional objects as proposals of intersubjective situations and tactile-kinaesthetic turn-takings. Conclusively, the results are discussed in relation to concepts of individuality and corporeal meaning in the workshop, the concrete rather than abstract masculinity, and in relation to the well-used concept of mediated experience in creative subjects such as Sloyd.
