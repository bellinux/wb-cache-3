Caterpillars of the Brazilian skipper butterfly (Calpodes ethlius), {{also known as the}} larger canna <b>leaf</b> <b>roller,</b> cut the leaves and roll them over to live inside while pupating and eating the leaf. [...] In addition, caterpillars of the lesser canna <b>leaf</b> <b>roller</b> (Geshna cannalis), a grass moth, will sew the leaves shut before they can unfurl by spinning a silk thread around the leaf.

40|$|The {{importance}} of mutualism is receiving more attention in community ecology. In this study, the fire ant Solenopsis invicta {{was found to}} take advantage of the shelters constructed by the <b>leaf</b> <b>roller</b> Sylepta derogata to protect mealybugs (Phenacoccus solenopsis) against their natural enemies. This protective effect of fire ant tending on the survival of mealybugs in shelters was observed when enemies and <b>leaf</b> <b>rollers</b> were simultaneously present. Specifically, fire ants moved the mealybugs inside the shelters produced by S. derogata on enemy-infested plants. Compared with that in plants without ants, the survival of mealybugs in shelters in the presence of natural enemies in plants with ants markedly improved. Both the protection of ants and the shelters provided by <b>leaf</b> <b>rollers</b> did not affect the survival of mealybugs in the absence of enemies in plants. Ants and <b>leaf</b> <b>rollers</b> significantly improved the survival of mealybugs in predator-infested plants, whereas no such improvement was observed in parasitoid-infested ones...|$|R

40|$|Field {{experiments}} were {{conducted during the}} 2012 and 2013 cropping seasons at the University of Maiduguri to compared the efficacies of selected aqueous plant extracts on {{the management of the}} population of eggplant <b>leaf</b> <b>roller</b> (Eublemma olivacea Wlk.) infesting eggplant (Solanum melongena L.). The extracts were from neem leaf; bitter melon; black current; ginger rhizome and wild onion. They were compared with a conventional insecticide, Lambdacot 500 EC and the absolute control. Extracts were applied at 5 % w/v while Lambdacot was applied at 1. 5 g a. i/ha. The results indicated that the mean number of <b>leaf</b> <b>rollers</b> in treated plots were significantly (P< 0. 05) lower than the control. The highest mean number of <b>leaf</b> <b>rollers</b> was 3. 01 and 3. 93. Lambdacot 500 EC had the lowest eggplant <b>leaf</b> <b>roller</b> counts per plant followed by neem, ginger rhizome and wild onion. The mean number of leaves damaged per plant followed similar trend. There was significantly (P< 0. 05) higher number of eggplant fruits/plant, fruit weight and fruit yield in the decreasing order of Lambdacot 500 EC, neem, wild onion, bitter melon and black current. The absolute control had the fewest number of eggplant fruits/plant, fruit weight and fruit yield. These aqueous extracts should be adopted by eggplant farmers as they are cost effective and friendly to the environment. However, the actual quantities of these extracts to be applied per plant depending on the variety of eggplant, season and weather condition of the cropping season and canopy architecture remain to be critically explored...|$|R

40|$|India is an {{agricultural}} country. Farmer has {{wide range of}} diversity to select suitable crops. However, cultivation of these crops for optimum yield and quality produce is highly technical by using technical support. Detection of plant disease is an essential research topic. Studies show that relying on pure naked-eye observation of expert to detect such diseases can be prohibitively expensive, especially in developing countries. Providing fast, automatic, cheap and accurate image processing-based solutions for that task can be great realistic significance. This paper presents computationally efficient method for <b>paddy</b> <b>leaf</b> disease identification. The proposed approaches consist of three phases: image segmentation, feature extraction and classification. Image segmentation technique is used to detect infected parts of leaf by using K-means clustering. The feature extraction phase derives features based on the <b>paddy</b> <b>leaf</b> image. These features are used as input to the classifier for classification purpose. In this experiment, the classifier is used as artificial neural network. Many researchers are working on real time plant leaf diseases from many years. In future, this project will be implemented for real time leaf disease detection. This project is very useful to farmer to detect paddy diseases at early stage...|$|R
40|$|In an {{agriculture}} field paddy {{is one of}} {{the major}} staple foods in the Asian countries like China, India, Indonesia, and Bangladesh etc. But paddy disease likes a Blast; Bacterial Leaf Blight; Rice tungro etc. stops the growth of the paddy trees. If the diseases are not detected at an early possible stage then there is a decrease in the production of paddy. In this paper a noble methodology i. e. image processing of the <b>paddy</b> <b>leaf</b> by histogram is proposed, to avoid large scale effect of these diseases. By this approach one can detect the disease at a very primary stage and thus can take necessary steps in time to minimize the loss of production. At first, an image of a <b>paddy</b> <b>leaf</b> is captured, and then processed for enhancement. Later, the image is converted from RGB colour image to gray image and then extracted to a histogram using MATLAB functions. The resultants of images are given as input to identify disease from classification of diseases and grading the diseases. After completing disease identification, and stage detection, a consultative treatment module of the disease was prepared with the help of agricultural experts...|$|R
