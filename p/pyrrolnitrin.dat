40|$|<b>Pyrrolnitrin</b> at 10 μg/ml {{inhibited}} {{the growth}} of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Penicillium atrovenetum, and P. oxalicum. The primary site of action of <b>pyrrolnitrin</b> on S. cerevisiae was the terminal electron transport system between succinate or reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and coenzyme Q. At growth inhibitory concentrations, <b>pyrrolnitrin</b> inhibited endogenous and exogenous respiration immediately after its addition to the system. In mitochondrial preparations, the antibiotic inhibited succinate oxidase, NADH oxidase, succinate-cytochrome c reductase, NADH-cytochrome c reductase, and succinate-coenzyme Q 6 reductase. In addition, <b>pyrrolnitrin</b> inhibited the antimycin-insensitive reduction of dichlorophenolindophenol and of the tetrazolium dye 2, 2 ′-di-p-nitrophenyl-(3, 3 ′-dimethoxy- 4, 4 ′-bi-phenylene) 5, 5 ′-diphenylditetrazolium. The reduction of another tetrazolium dye, 2 -p-iodophenyl- 3 -p-nitrophenyl- 5 -phenyltetrazolium chloride, that was antimycin-sensitive, was also inhibited by <b>pyrrolnitrin.</b> The antibiotic {{had no effect on}} the activity of cytochrome oxidase, and it did not appear to bind with flavine adenine dinucleotide, the coenzyme of succinic dehydrogenase.

We have isolated a 32 -kb genomic DNA fragment from this strain that contains genes involved in the biosynthesis of <b>pyrrolnitrin.</b> Marker-exchange mutagenesis of this DNA with Tn 5 revealed the presence of a 6. 2 -kb region that contains genes required for the synthesis of <b>pyrrolnitrin.</b> The nucleotide sequence of the 6. 2 -kb region was determined and found to contain a cluster of four genes that are required for the production of <b>pyrrolnitrin.</b> Deletion mutations in any of the four genes resulted in a pyrrolnitrin-nonproducing phenotype. The putative coding sequences of the four individual genes were cloned by PCR and fused to the tac promoter from Escherichia coli. In each case, the appropriate tac promoter-pyrrolnitrin gene fusion was shown to complement the pyrrolnitrin-negative phenotype of the corresponding deletion mutant.

After multiple subcutaneous doses of <b>pyrrolnitrin</b> at 20 mg/kg, activity was recovered in mouse blood and urine as well as kidney, liver, and brain homogenates. Multiple daily doses (50 mg/kg) of this antibiotic were effective in reducing by 74 % the number of viable cells of C. albicans recovered from kidney homogenates.

In mitochondrial preparations, <b>pyrrolnitrin</b> strongly inhibited respiration and the rotenone-sensitive NADH-cytochrome c reductase. The rotenone-insensitive NADH-cytochrome c reductase, the succinate-cytochrome c reductase, and the reduction of dichlorophenolindophenol by either NADH or succinate were inhibited to a lesser extent. However, the activity of cytochrome oxidase was not affected by <b>pyrrolnitrin.</b> The extent of reduction of flavoproteins by NADH and succinate, measured at 465 - 510 nm, was unaltered; however, the reduction of cytochrome b, measured at 560 - 575 nm, was partially inhibited by <b>pyrrolnitrin.</b> The level of totally reduced cytochrome b was restored with antimycin A.

Mutants of strain BL 915 that did not produce <b>pyrrolnitrin</b> and did not suppress damping-off of cotton by R. solani were generated by exposure to N-methyl-N′ -nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. A gene region that was capable of restoring <b>pyrrolnitrin</b> production to the non-pyrrolnitrin-producing mutants and of conferring this ability upon two other P. fluorescens strains not otherwise known to produce this compound or to be capable of suppressing damping-off caused by R. solani was isolated from strain BL 915.

We derived mutants of Pf- 5 with single and multiple mutations in biosynthesis genes for seven antifungal metabolites: 2, 4 -diacetylphoroglucinol (DAPG), <b>pyrrolnitrin,</b> pyoluteorin, hydrogen cyanide, rhizoxin, orfamide A, and toxoflavin. These mutants were tested for inhibition of the pathogens Fusarium verticillioides and Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. pisi. Rhizoxin, <b>pyrrolnitrin,</b> and DAPG were found to be primarily responsible for fungal antagonism by Pf- 5. Previously, other workers showed that the mycotoxin fusaric acid, which is produced by many Fusarium species, including F. verticillioides, inhibited the production of DAPG by Pseudomonas spp. In this study, amendment of culture media with fusaric acid decreased DAPG production, increased pyoluteorin production, and had no consistent influence on <b>pyrrolnitrin</b> or orfamide A production by Pf- 5. Fusaric acid also altered the transcription of biosynthetic genes, indicating that the mycotoxin influenced antibiotic production by Pf- 5 at the transcriptional level. Addition of fusaric acid to the culture medium reduced antibiosis of F. verticillioides by Pf- 5 and derivative strains that produce DAPG but had no effect on antibiosis by Pf- 5 derivatives that suppressed F. verticillioides due to <b>pyrrolnitrin</b> or rhizoxin production. Our results demonstrated the importance of three compounds, rhizoxin, <b>pyrrolnitrin,</b> and DAPG, in suppression of Fusarium spp. by Pf- 5 and confirmed that an interspecies signaling system mediated by fusaric acid had parallel effects on antifungal metabolite production and antibiosis by the bacterial biological control organism...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to estimate {{the risk of a}} decrease in the efficacy of biocontrol as a result of selection pressure exerted by biocontrol agents on Botrytis cinerea, focusing on <b>pyrrolnitrin,</b> an antibiotic identified in diverse biocontrol agents having an effect on B. cinerea. To evaluate a possible decrease in sensitivity to <b>pyrrolnitrin,</b> 10 successive generations of five isolates of B. cinerea were produced in vitro {{in the presence of a}} sublethal dose (10 mu g L- 1) of the antibiotic. For one isolate, a significant reduction in the sensitivity to <b>pyrrolnitrin</b> at the fifth generation was observed with a resistance factor of c. 11. The production of 10 additional generations for four of these isolates, with increasing doses of <b>pyrrolnitrin</b> (100 - 4000 mu g L- 1), resulted in the development of variants of B. cinerea with high levels of resistance to the antibiotic (RF > 1000) and a reduced sensitivity in vitro to a pyrrolnitrin-producing bacterium. Reverse adaptation of resistant variants after 10 additional generations in the absence of selection pressure was not observed, suggesting stability of the resistance. Comparison of the pyrrolnitrin-resistant generations and their sensitive parental isolates for mycelial growth, sporulation and aggressiveness on plant tissues revealed that the high level of resistance to <b>pyrrolnitrin</b> resulted in a high fitness cost. Mycelial growth was reduced between 1. 7 to 3. 6 times and sporulation reduced 3. 8 to 6. 6 times that of sensitive parental isolates.

We used liquid culture assays to identify several minerals and carbon sources which had a differential influence on {{the production of the}} antibiotics 2, 4 -diacetylphloroglucinol (PHL), pyoluteorin (PLT), and <b>pyrrolnitrin</b> and the siderophores salicylic acid and pyochelin by the model strain CHA 0, which was isolated from a natural disease-suppressive soil in Switzerland. Production of PHL was stimulated by Zn 2 +, NH 4 Mo 2 +, and glucose; the precursor compound mono-acetylphloroglucinol was stimulated by the same factors as PHL. Production of PLT was stimulated by Zn 2 +, Co 2 +, and glycerol but was repressed by glucose. <b>Pyrrolnitrin</b> production was increased by fructose, mannitol, and a mixture of Zn 2 + and NH 4 Mo 2 +. Pyochelin production was increased by Co 2 +, fructose, mannitol, and glucose. Interestingly, production of its precursor salicylic acid was increased by different factors, i. e., NH 4 Mo 2 +, glycerol, and glucose. The mixture of Zn 2 + and NH 4 Mo 2 + with fructose, mannitol, or glycerol further enhanced the production of PHL and PLT compared with either the minerals or the carbon sources used alone, but it did not improve siderophore production. Extending fermentation time from 2 to 5 days increased the accumulation of PLT, <b>pyrrolnitrin,</b> and pyochelin but not of PHL. When findings with CHA 0 were extended to an ecologically and genetically diverse collection of 41 P. fluorescens biocontrol strains, the effect of certain factors was strain dependent, while others had a general effect. Stimulation of PHL by Zn 2 + and glucose was strain dependent, whereas PLT production by all strains that can produce this compound was stimulated by Zn 2 + and transiently repressed by glucose. Inorganic phosphate reduced PHL production by CHA 0 and seven other strains tested but to various degrees. Production of PLT but not <b>pyrrolnitrin</b> by CHA 0 was also reduced by 100 mM phosphate. The use of 1 / 10 -strength nutrient broth-yeast extract, compared with standard nutrient broth-yeast extract, amended with glucose and/or glycerol resulted in dramatically increased accumulations of PHL (but not PLT), pyochelin, and salicylic acid, indicating that the ratio of carbon source to nutrient concentration {{played a key role in}} the metabolic flow. The results of this study (i) provide insight into the biosynthetic regulation of antimicrobial compounds, (ii) limit the number of factors for intensive study in situ, and (iii) indicate factors that can be manipulated to improve bacterial inoculants...|$|E
40|$|Exposure to {{microorganisms}} {{is considered}} an environmental factor which can contribute to diabetes mellitus via cytotoxicity or autoimmune responses against pancreatic cells. Firstly, the effects on rat insulinoma pancreatic β-cell line of secondary metabolites <b>pyrrolnitrin</b> (Burkholderia spp), phenazine compounds (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia spp) were investigated. Both compounds separately showed significant cytotoxicity after 24 h and at concentrations of 10 & 100 ng/ml potentiated insulin gene transcription, Ca 2 + content and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Furthermore, the outward membrane current was inhibited by phenazine (100 ng/ml) or <b>pyrrolnitrin</b> (10 or 100 ng/ml). Secondly, the capacity of 45 microbial species to bind insulin was screened {{in order to assess}} how common insulin binding was amongst microorganisms Burkholderia multivorans, B. cenocepacia and Aeromonas salmonicida bound insulin. A genomic library of B. multivorans was constructed in λ Zap Express and screened successfully for insulin binding recombinants. Recombinant phagemids p 1 & p 2 were excised, p 1, encoded an insulin binding protein (IBP 1 30 kDa) with homology to the iron complex siderophore receptor. For p 2, two IBPs were detected at 20 & 30 kDa (IBP 2 & IBP 3), representing an intracellular and outer membrane peptide transporter. Comparison of IBP 1 and human insulin receptor (HIR) produced 6 linear epitopes, and for IBP 2 & IBP 3 produced 3 epitopes. Thirdly, glutamic acid decarboxylase GAD 65 is a major pancreatic autoantigen contributing to autoimmune diabetes. To assess the likelihood that microorganisms possess epitopes that mimic regions on GAD, 45 microbial species were tested for homology. This was facilitated by purifying recombinant GAD protein which was used to produce GAD antiserum. Four E. coli cross-reacting proteins were identified using mass spectrometry, outer-membrane protein A, formate dehydrogenase, superoxide dismutase and DNA starvation protein. Epitopes occurred at the C-terminal region of GAD 65 (residues 419 – 565), a region previously reported to be targeted by autoantibodies. This study suggests that <b>pyrrolnitrin</b> and phenazine are cytotoxic to pancreatic β-cells and B. multivorans IBPs linear epitopes may be diabetogenic, particularly in patients with cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) who suffer a long term infections with Pseudomonas and Burkholderia species. Furthermore, microbial GAD epitopes could potentially induce an autoimmune response leading to diabetes. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Strains of Pseudomonas {{that produce}} {{antimicrobial}} metabolites and control soilborne plant diseases {{have often been}} isolated from soils defined as disease-suppressive, i. e., soils, in which specific plant pathogens are present, but plants show no or reduced disease symptoms. Moreover, {{it is assumed that}} pseudomonads producing antimicrobial compounds such as 2, 4 -diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG) or phenazines (PHZ) contribute to the specific disease resistance of suppressive soils. However, pseudomonads producing antimicrobial metabolites are also present in soils that are conducive to disease. Currently, it is still unknown whether and to which extent the abundance of antimicrobials-producing pseudomonads is related to the general disease resistance of common agricultural soils. Moreover, virtually nothing is known about the conditions under which pseudomonads express antimicrobial genes in agricultural field soils. We present here results of the first side-by-side comparison of 10 representative Swiss agricultural soils with a cereal-oriented cropping history for (i) the resistance against two soilborne pathogens, (ii) the abundance of Pseudomonas bacteria harboring genes involved in the biosynthesis of the antimicrobials DAPG, PHZ, and <b>pyrrolnitrin</b> on roots of wheat, and (iii) the ability to support the expression of these genes on the roots. Our study revealed that the level of soil disease resistance strongly depends on the type of pathogen, e. g., soils that are highly resistant to Gaeumannomyces tritici often are highly susceptible to Pythium ultimum and vice versa. There was no significant correlation between the disease resistance of the soils, the abundance of Pseudomonas bacteria carrying DAPG, PHZ, and <b>pyrrolnitrin</b> biosynthetic genes, and the ability of the soils to support the expression of the antimicrobial genes. Correlation analyses indicated that certain soil factors such as silt, clay, and some macro- and micronutrients influence both the abundance and the expression of the antimicrobial genes. Taken together, {{the results of this study}} suggests that pseudomonads producing DAPG, PHZ, or <b>pyrrolnitrin</b> are present and abundant in Swiss agricultural soils and that the soils support the expression of the respective biosynthetic genes in these bacteria to various degrees. The precise role that these pseudomonads play in the general disease resistance of the investigated agricultural soils remains elusive...|$|E
30|$|Physical {{thickening}} of cell {{walls in}} plants caused by BCAs contributes to induced resistance via diverse mechanisms that involve lignification, callose deposition and accumulation of antimicrobial low-molecular-weight substances (e.g., phytoalexins), and synthesis of chitinases, glucanases, peroxidases, and other pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins. Several endophytes such as Bacillus and Paenibacillus {{have been reported}} to inhibit soil-borne phytopathogens of pulse crops by production of siderophore, hydrolytic enzymes, antibiotics, and hydrogen cyanide (Senthilkumar et al., 2009). Florescent pseudomonad bacterium produces phenazine (Toohay et al., 1965), phloroglucinol (Howell and Stipanovic, 1980), siderophores (Sakthivel et al., 1986), and <b>pyrrolnitrin</b> (Burkhead and Geoghegan, 1994).|$|E

40|$|Botrytis cinerea {{is able to}} {{build-up}} {{resistance to}} <b>pyrrolnitrin,</b> an antibiotic produced by diverse biocontrol agents, possibly compromising the durability of this method of disease control. The development of two near-isogenic lines of B. cinerea differing in their level of resistance to <b>pyrrolnitrin</b> was compared in tomato plants and on PDA medium. In tomato plants, {{significant differences in the}} percentage of infected petioles one day after inoculation and in symptom progression on petioles and stems were observed between the resistant mutant and the sensitive wild-type parent suggesting a difference in their level of aggressiveness. Cytohistological investigations revealed that conidia of both near-isogenic lines germinated 6 hours after inoculation and mycelium developed within petiole tissues 12 hours after inoculation. However, while the wild-type parent isolate spread throughout the petiole and rapidly invaded the stem tissues via the leaf-abscission zone 72 hours after inoculation, the pyrrolnitrin-resistant mutant failed to extend beyond petiole tissues to invade the stem. Moreover, 72 hours after inoculation, the mycelial development of the pyrrolnitrin-resistant mutant was accompanied by abnormal glycogen accumulation and chlamydospore-like cells formation. In contrast, wild-type parent mycelium was normally structured with intensive colonization of stem tissues. Additionally, on PDA medium the mycelium of the pyrrolnitrin-resistant mutant was less vigorous than the wild-type isolate. These results suggest that the acquisition of pyrrolnitrin-resistance in B. cinerea is accompanied by changes in mycelial structure and reduction in mycelial growth, leading to a noticeable loss of aggressiveness on tomato plant...|$|E
