40|$|Conservation areas, {{both public}} and private, are {{critical}} tools to protect biodiversity and deliver important ecosystem services (ES) to society. Although societal benefits from such ES are increasingly used to promote public support of conservation, the number of beneficiaries, their identity, and the magnitude of benefits are largely unknown {{for the vast majority}} of conservation areas in the United States public-private conservation network. The location of conservation areas in relation to people strongly influences the direction and magnitude of ES flows as well as the identity of beneficiaries. We analyzed benefit zones, the areas to which selected ES could be conveyed to beneficiaries, to assess who benefits from a typical conservation network. Better knowledge of ES flows and beneficiaries will help land conservationists make a stronger case for the broad collateral benefits of conservation and help to address issues of social-environmental justice. To evaluate who benefits the most from the current public-private conservation network, we delineated the benefit zones for local ES (within 16 km) that are conveyed along hydrological paths from public (federal and state) and <b>private</b> (<b>easements)</b> conservation lands in the states of North Carolina and Virginia, USA. We also discuss the challenges and demonstrate an approach for delineating nonhydrological benefits that are passively conveyed to beneficiaries. We mapped and compared the geographic distribution of benefit zones within and among conservation area types. We further compared beneficiary demographics across benefit zones of the conservation area types and found that hydrological benefit zones of federal protected areas encompass disproportionately fewer minority beneficiaries compared to statewide demographic patterns. In contrast, benefit zones of state protected areas and <b>private</b> <b>easements</b> encompassed a much greater proportion of minority beneficiaries (~ 22 - 25 %). Benefit zones associated with private conservation lands included beneficiaries of significantly greater household income than benefit zones of other types of conservation areas. Our analysis of ES flows revealed significant socioeconomic gaps in how the current public-private conservation network benefits the public. These gaps warrant consideration in regional conservation plans and suggest that private conservation initiatives may be best suited for responding to the equity challenge. Enhancing the ecosystem benefits and the equity of benefit delivery from private conservation networks could build public and political support for long-term conservation strategies and ultimately enhance conservation efficacy...|$|R

5000|$|The English rule used to {{distinguish}} {{between public and private}} waters was based on the limit of the tide, for those waters that were navigable were subject to admiralty jurisdiction. In the U.S., this rule had been extended to include navigable fresh water [...] "reasonably capable of valuable use as a public way." [...] However, it was not always clear that a pond - isolated from the ocean or a navigable river, but otherwise in the public domain - was reserved for public use. Furthermore, the ability to hunt and fish on public lands had been denied to citizens during feudal times, and that [...] "system of legal inequality in the enjoyment of public property" [...] was precisely what the colonists sought to avoid. Thus, a new rule defining public waters needed to be established that was not based on the navigability of the waters.By the English rule thus modified, the legal title of New Hampshire land was in the king, who held it as trustee in his official and representative capacity, with no private interest. The dry land, and the soil under fresh rivers, brooks, and small ponds, was convertible, by his grant, into private property, for settlement, and for the advancement of the common welfare. The seashore, arms of the sea, and large ponds, by reason of their special adaptation to public uses, were set apart and reserved as public waters. They could not be converted into private estate or subjected to a <b>private</b> <b>easement,</b> by the trustee's grant, or by any act of the executive branch of the government. The distinction is between what the trustee held for public use and what he held for the purpose of sale or other appropriation to private use for the public benefit.In 1647 the want of a definition of “great ponds” was supplied,[...] [...] that no town shall appropriate to any particular person or persons any great pond containing more than ten acres of land, and that no man shall come upon another's propriety sic without their leave.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} twenty-five years, courts and {{commentators}} have recognized and upheld conservation easements {{as an important}} vehicle to preserve natural and ecologically sensitive land, focusing primarily on easements held by nonprofit organizations (NPOs).

This paper maintains that these two independent developments militate for {{the increased use of}} consensual conservation easements by governmental entities to achieve public land preservation goals. Governmental conservation easements can realize the benefits of efficiency, consent and free choice, and conservation, while avoiding the coercion implicit in public land use regulation. Moreover, governmental conservation easements have advantages over <b>private</b> <b>easements</b> in some situations: governmental easements may be more easily modified or even terminated to address future changes in conservation values and community needs; as with public land use regulation, governmental easements must be transparent and are subject to democratic, participatory processes that NPOs do not have to follow; and properly functioning governmental ownership may be best able to discern and represent the public interest when making acquisition, modification, and termination decisions about conservation easements. I suggest that both NPO-held conservation easement activities and legitimate public land use regulation are valuable and should continue, but argue that increased use of governmental conservation easements can bring significant benefits as well...|$|R

As our society urbanizes, open space preser-vation is an increasingly important regional and national policy issue.

50|$|Brachtenbach, {{while sitting}} as a Washington State Supreme Court Justice, wrote the opinion for Brown v. Voss, 105 Wash.2d 366, 715 P.2d 514 (1986). The issue in Voss was: {{to what extent}} can the owner of a <b>private</b> road <b>easement</b> {{traverse}} the servient estate to not only reach the dominant estate, but a parcel (subsequently acquired by the dominant estate owner) adjacent to the dominant estate when such usage does not increase the burden on the servient estate? While Brachtenbach stated the general rule that an easement appurtenant to one parcel of land may not be extended by the owner of the dominant estate to an additional non-dominant parcel owned by the owner of the dominant estate regardless of whether the additional parcel is adjacent to the dominant estate, and further declared that if an easement appurtenant serves a particular parcel of land, any extension of the easement is a misuse of the easement—Brachtenbach still ultimately allowed the owner of the dominant estate to continue using the easement to access the additional, non-dominant estate because a grant of injunctive relief would be inappropriate in light of the circumstances. In short, Brachtenbach essentially found in favor of the Plaintiff by not granting the defendant injunctive relief (i.e. preventing the owner of the dominant estate to continue to use the easement to access the adjacent non-dominant estate) although the plaintiff unlawfully extended the easement. Brachtenbach rationalized that a grant of injunctive relief under the circumstances would be inappropriate and against the principles of equity because (while no additional harm to the servient estate resulted from the extension of the easement) if injunctive relief was in fact given to the defendant, it would only serve to harm the plaintiff while not providing any benefit or protection to the defendant.|$|R
40|$|This Article {{explores the}} history of natural {{resources}} law and pollution control law to provide insights into current efforts by states to create wind easements, solar easements, and other property rights {{in the use of}} or access to renewable resources. Development of these resources is critical to current efforts to address climate change, which has a foot in both natural resources law and pollution control law. This creates challenges for developing theoretical and policy frameworks in this area, particularly surrounding the role of property rights. Property rights have {{played an important role in}} both natural resources law and pollution control law, but the role in each field is quite different. Early natural resources law was based significantly on conveying property rights in natural resources to private parties to encourage westward expansion and economic development. By contrast, pollution control law as it developed in the 1970 s and 1980 s was based on placing limits on such rights and creating government permit systems to meet environmental protection goals. This Article proposes that as scholars and policymakers consider approaches to developing wind and solar energy, it will be important to not rely too heavily on a property rights-based, natural resource development approach. Instead, this Article argues that an approach that integrates resource access into state and local permitting and land use planning frameworks may better meet development and environmental protection goals without creating new entrenched and potentially problematic property rights in natural resources. Moreover, because wind development and solar development present different concerns with regard to size, scale, and environmental impact, this Article suggests that solar development should be structured based on <b>private</b> solar <b>easement</b> transactions within a hospitable local zoning framework while wind development should be based on a state-wide siting and permitting structure with much more limited local government involvement...|$|R

40|$|Private land {{conservation}} {{provides an opportunity}} to address problems of habitat fragmentation and biodiversity loss caused {{by an increase in}} the development and parcelization of <b>private</b> land. Conservation <b>easements</b> (CEs) are an innovative tool used by land trusts to protect significant natural qualities of private land in perpetuity, while also allowing the land to remain in private ownership. Traditionally, property represents an individualistic relationship, however, CEs redefine this relationship by seeking to maximize the overlap in private and public goods in property. In this study, I explore the relationship between the common good and private property through an analysis of landowner attitudes and interest in conveying CEs. To address my research objectives I implemented a mixed-mode survey to 664 private landowners in the Whychus Creek Watershed in Deschutes County, OR. I received 257 survey responses, yielding a response rate of 41 %. The first layer of this study focuses on landowner attitudes towards CEs (Chapter 2). The results of an exploratory factor analysis suggest there are two dimensions to landowner attitudes towards CEs [...] internal and external dimension. I constructed logistic regression models to predict positive internal and external attitudes and found that external attitudes are primarily influenced by environmental beliefs, whereas internal attitudes are influenced by a suite of factors including financial beliefs and perceived risk to private ownership. Furthermore, landowner knowledge and awareness of CEs {{may play a role in}} attitude development. I found that as awareness increased the number of landowners perceiving low risk also increased. Additionally, I found that those who learned about CEs from a peer were more likely to have an extreme positive or negative attitude towards CEs. The second part of this study focuses on landowner interest in conveying a CE (Chapter 3). The results of a multinomial logistic regression analysis suggest that positive external and internal attitudes towards CEs provide the foundation for CE, while personal incentives and connections to the social and/or natural community serve as the motivation driving CE conveyance. Although the results of this study are only representative of landowners in the Whychus Creek Watershed I argue that some of the findings may be more broadly applicable. Contributing to our conceptual understanding of CEs, I discuss how CEs may be beneficial in reintegrating the common good into private property. Further, I highlight that landowner connections to both the social community and natural environment are important characteristics of CE conveyance as well as private {{land conservation}} in general...|$|R
40|$|Wetlands in the Nebraska's Rainwater Basin (RWB) have {{decreased}} by 90 {{percent over the}} past two centuries and are subject to on-going degradation of quality from urban and agricultural land-use practices. Losses in wetland habitat quantity and quality are important because the RWB serves as a critical spring staging area to ~ 7 million dabbling ducks, including approximately 50 percent of North America's mid-continent mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) population, and 30 percent of North America's total Northern pintail (A. acuta) population. During spring, waterfowl depend on wetland habitat for aquatic invertebrates and plant materials to accumulate the energy and protein needed to complete migration and initiate egg production. If demands for quality food resources are not met, waterfowl may arrive at breeding grounds in poorer body condition, and consequently be less likely to achieve reproductive success. This cross-seasonal effect is believed to be driven by excessive habitat loss at mid-latitudes, introduction of invasive plant species, and depletion of food resources by fall migrants. Given the importance of food resource acquisition at mid-latitude stopover sites and subsequent effects on recruitment, the goal {{of this study was to}} improve understanding of food resource availability in wetlands and the relationship to habitat use by spring-migrating waterfowl. I conducted weekly waterfowl surveys and quantified local habitat characteristics including seed density (kg/ha), invertebrate density (kg/ha), energy derived from food resources (kcal/ha), water depth, wetland area, vegetative cover, and several water quality parameters at 32 wetlands in spring 2014 and 35 wetlands in spring 2015. Additionally, I quantified wetland habitat surrounding each study site by assessing wetland area and number of wetlands (greater than 1 ha) within 2. 5 km and 5 km of a study site. Study sites were located on public lands managed by the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission and the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, <b>private</b> conservation <b>easement</b> lands enrolled in the Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP), and on private lands managed for agriculture (cropped and non-cropped). A set of species distribution models were developed to explain spring dabbling duck density and species richness in the RWB. I hypothesized that a combination of local (food density, energy, water depth, wetland area, and vegetative cover) and landscape variables would explain the greatest amount of variability in dabbling duck density. In 2014 (a dry year), energy, seed density, water depth, wetland area, and wetland density in the surrounding landscape were positively associated with dabbling duck density; however, invertebrate density and vegetative cover had no influence on dabbling duck density. In 2015 (wet year), seed density and energy were positively associated with dabbling duck density; however, water depth, wetland area, vegetative cover, invertebrate density, and wetland area in the surrounding landscape had no influence on dabbling duck density. Wetland area and water depth were the only useful explanatory variables for explaining species richness in 2014, whereas in 2015 dabbling duck species richness was best explained by wetland area and vegetative cover. I used non-parametric analyses to compare seed density, and true metabolizable energy (TME) at three wetland types; public, WRP, and cropped wetlands. Seed density did not vary among wetland types in 2014 or 2015. Median seed density estimates during both years at public, WRP, and cropped wetlands were 593 kg/ha (??= 621 kg/ha), 561 kg/ha (??= 566 kg/ha), and 419 kg/ha (??= 608 kg/ha) respectively. Seed density was consistent between years for public and WRP wetlands, but varied between years for cropped units (p less than 0. 05). Variation in seed density between years at cropped wetlands was likely influenced by the presence/absence of agricultural waste grains. Cumulative TME varied among wetland type in 2014 and 2015, with greater TME at cropped wetlands (median = 2431 kcal/kg) than public (median = 1740 kcal/kg) and WRP wetlands (median = 1781 kcal/kg), however TME did not differ between WRP and public wetlands. TME was consistent among wetland types between 2014 and 2015. Seed density estimates from this study were statistically greater than estimates currently used for management planning in the RWB, however, TME estimates were statistically less than estimates currently assumed for WRP and public wetlands in the region. My estimates for mean aquatic invertebrate density were approximately 40 -fold less than estimates for mean seed density. Benthic communities accounted for 68 percent of the total invertebrate density, however invertebrate diversity was greater in nektonic communities. Neonicotinoid synthetic insecticides are believed to have a deleterious effect on aquatic invertebrate communities in agricultural areas, although their occurrence in RWB wetlands were previously unknown. I detected trace levels of neonicotinoids in 92 percent of water samples collected in wetlands sampled in the RWB during the spring of 2015. I predicted a relatively high detection rate given the intensity of row crop production in the region, though concentrations were lower than expected. Concentrations at 26 wetlands sampled fell below toxicity benchmarks proposed by the Canadian Environmental Quality Guidelines, and only 11 percent of wetlands sampled had concentrations exceeding the most conservative benchmark proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency. Neonicotinoids concentrations were minimal at wetlands with vegetative buffers strips greater than or equal to 50 m between a wetland and a cropped field, relative to wetlands with vegetative buffers strips less than 50 m. Although neonicotinoid levels were below lethal concentrations for all aquatic invertebrates identified in this study, I observed a negative association between neonicotinoid concentrations and aquatic invertebrate density (g/m 2) ...|$|R
