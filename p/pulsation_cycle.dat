Four of the six clusters were fitted with wide-bore tapered liners and represented all combinations of two claw volumes (150 or 420 ml) and two short-milk-tube bores (8. 5 mm and 13. 5 mm). Two clusters were fitted with narrow-bore liners (22 and 25 mm) that had large-bore short milk tubes and large claw volumes. The vacuum variations were expressed as mean vacuum at the teat-end during the b-phase of pulsation (TVB), mean vacuum at the teat end measured over complete <b>pulsation</b> <b>cycles</b> (TV), minimum vacuum measured over complete <b>pulsation</b> <b>cycles</b> (TVM) and amplitude of vacuum fluctuation measured over complete <b>pulsation</b> <b>cycles</b> (TVF). The highest level of TVB was recorded with wide-bore tapered liners. For a milking unit fitted with a wide-bore tapered liner TVF was reduced and TVM increased by increasing either the bore of the short milk tube or the volume of the claw. When the bore of the LMT was increased TVB, TV and TVF increased. Simultaneous pulsation gave higher TVB (P < 0. 001) and higher TVF (P < 0. 001) than alternate pulsation for all cluster types.

40|$|The stellar {{parameters}} of RR Lyrae stars vary considerably over a <b>pulsation</b> <b>cycle,</b> and their determination {{is crucial for}} stellar modelling. We present a detailed spectroscopic analysis of the pulsating star RR Lyr, the prototype of its class, over a complete <b>pulsation</b> <b>cycle,</b> based on high-resolution spectra collected at the 2. 7 -m telescope of McDonald Observatory. We used simultaneous photometry to determine the accurate pulsation phase of each spectrum and determined the effective temperature, {{the shape of the}} depth-dependent microturbulent velocity, and the abundance of several elements, for each phase. The surface gravity was fixed to 2. 4. Element abundances resulting from our analysis are stable over the <b>pulsation</b> <b>cycle.</b> However, a variation in ionisation equilibrium is observed around minimum radius. We attribute this mostly to a dynamical acceleration contributing to the surface gravity. Variable turbulent convection on time scales longer than the <b>pulsation</b> <b>cycle</b> has been proposed as a cause for the Blazhko effect. We test this hypothesis to some extent by using the derived variable depth-dependent microturbulent velocity profiles to estimate their effect on the stellar magnitude. These effects turn out to be wavelength-dependent and much smaller than the observed light variations over the Blazhko cycle: if variations in the turbulent motions are entirely responsible for the Blazhko effect, they must surpass the scales covered by the microturbulent velocity.
