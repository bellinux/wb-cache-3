5|$|Copper {{is used in}} roofing, currency, and for {{photographic}} technology {{known as}} the daguerreotype. Copper was used in Renaissance sculpture, and was used to construct the Statue of Liberty; copper continues {{to be used in}} construction of various types. Copper plating and copper sheathing were widely used to protect the under-water hulls of ships, a technique pioneered by the British Admiralty in the 18th century. The Norddeutsche Affinerie in Hamburg was the first modern electroplating plant, starting its production in 1876. The German scientist Gottfried Osann invented powder metallurgy in 1830 while determining the metal's atomic mass; around then it was discovered that the amount and type of alloying element (e.g., tin) to copper would affect bell tones.

25|$|As a {{secondary}} mineral, turquoise forms by {{the action of}} percolating acidic aqueous solutions during the weathering and oxidation of preexisting minerals. For example, the copper may come from <b>primary</b> <b>copper</b> sulfides such as chalcopyrite or from the secondary carbonates malachite or azurite; the aluminium may derive from feldspar; and the phosphorus from apatite. Climate factors appear {{to play an important role}} as turquoise is typically found in arid regions, filling or encrusting cavities and fractures in typically highly altered volcanic rocks, often with associated limonite and other iron oxides. In the Southwestern United States turquoise is almost invariably associated with the weathering products of copper sulfide deposits in or around potassium-feldspar-bearing porphyritic intrusives. In some occurrences alunite, potassium aluminium sulfate, is a prominent secondary mineral. Typically turquoise mineralization is restricted to a relatively shallow depth of less than , although it does occur along deeper fracture zones where secondary solutions have greater penetration or the depth to the water table is greater.|$|E

40|$|A small, <b>primary</b> disseminated <b>copper</b> deposit {{is located}} in the Cerrillos mining {{district}}, Santa Fe County, New Mexico, about one mile north of the town of Cerrillos. Rocks in the Cerrillos district consist of latitic flows and monzonitic and syenitic intrusives of probable Early Tertiary age. The disseminated copper mineralization is located between the Cash Entry and Mina del Tiro mines, around a small, circular coarse-grained monzonite stock that has invaded monzonite porphyry and pink syenite. Spectrographic analy-sis of 1, 600 surface rock samples shows that a copper anomaly forms an annular ring up to 600 feet wide nearly encircling the coarse-grained monzonite stock. The anomalous area contains more than 2, 000 ppm copper-in-rock. In the area of the copper anomaly, the mineralization at the surface consists of green copper carbonates and silicates. Drilling has revealed that the mineraliza 6 on at depth consists of thin veinlets and disseminated grains of chalcopyrite and rare bornire. The best grades of copper min-eralization are found in silicified monzonite that also contains secondary biotite. The grade of the oxidized portion of the deposit is essentially the same as that in the unoxidized portion and virtually no secondary enrichment has occurred. As a consequence, the deposit {{is considered to be a}} <b>primary</b> disseminated <b>copper</b> deposit, the upper part of which has been slightly modified by surface oxidation. A zone of pyritization associated with strong argillic alteration and turquoise is found outside of the zone of copper mineralization...|$|R

50|$|Copper {{has been}} used since ancient times. Details of Copper mining and {{metallurgy}} are available in ancient works like Arthashastra. Copper is mainly used in Industrial applications, Electrical/Electronic equipments and Consumer products such as utensils. Major resources of Copper are available at Rajasthan, Madhya pradesh and Jharkhand. As on 2010, India had 1.56 billion tonnes of Copper ore. India {{is one of the}} 20 major Copper producers. In 2008, India produced 7,10,000 tonnes of copper. Hindustan Copper Limited, a public sector company is the only producer of <b>primary</b> refined <b>copper.</b> Post-pillar method and Blast hole stoping method are used for Mining.

50|$|The good raw {{material}} supply ensured high capacity utilisation {{of the production}} plants during the entire fiscal year. Overall, a total of 2,057,000 t of concentrates (2,063,000 t in the prior year) were processed at the Hamburg and Pirdop sites. The sulphuric acid output decreased to 2,002,000 t (2,071,000 t in the prior year) due to the concentrate throughput. At 934,000 t (932,000 t in the prior year), the cathode output increased again. The operating EBT of Business Unit (BU) <b>Primary</b> <b>Copper</b> rose significantly to €169.5 million (€65.4 million in the prior year). This increase in earnings is especially attributed to the favourable market trend for copper and copper {{raw material}}s as well as sulphuric acid.|$|E
