These variations of i//m are closely correl-ated with changes in malate, mannitol and the concen-tration of the well-known osmoticum K +, which agree with the involvement of an osmotic adjustment to counteract the evaporative demand during daylight hours.

A solar air heater, comprising two absorber systems in a single flat-plate collector, was designed {{on the principles of}} <b>psychrometry.</b> The heater was integrated to a drying chamber for food dehydration.

40|$|Turgor {{measured}} with a miniature pressure probe was compared to that {{measured with}} an isopiestic thermocouple psychrometer in mature regions of soybean (Glycine max [L. ] Merr.) stems. The probe measured turgor directly in cells of intact stems whereas the psychrometer measured the water potential and osmotic potential of excised stem segments and turgor was calculated by difference. When care was taken to prevent dehydration when working with the pressure probe, and diffusive resistance and dilution errors with the psychrometer, both methods gave similar values of turgor whether the plants were dehydrating or rehydrating. This finding, together with the previously demonstrated similarity in turgor measured with the isopiestic psychrometer and a pressure chamber, indicates that the pressure probe provides accurate measurements of turgor despite the need to penetrate the cell.

To test {{the reliability of}} an earlier study showing embolism refilling in roots at negative leaf water potentials, embolisms were counted, and root water potentials (Ψroot) and osmotic potentials of exuded xylem sap from the same roots were measured by isopiestic <b>psychrometry.</b> All vessels were full at dawn (Ψroot − 0. 1 MPa). Embolisms were first seen in late metaxylem vessels at 8 am. Embolized late metaxylem vessels peaked at 50 % at 10 am (Ψroot − 0. 1 MPa), fell to 44 % by 12 pm (Ψroot − 0. 23 MPa), then dropped steadily to zero by early evening (Ψroot − 0. 28 MPa). Transpiration was highest (8. 5 μg cm− 2 s− 1) between 12 and 2 pm when the percentage of vessels embolized was falling. Embolized vessels were refilled by liquid moving through their lateral walls. Xylem sap was very low in solutes. The mechanism of vessel refilling, when Ψroot is negative, requires further investigation.

40|$|The {{evergreen}} herb Pachysandra terminalis becomes moderately frost-hardy in winter. The water {{relations of}} its frost-hardy leaves were studied during a freeze-thaw cycle. Leaf water potentials, measured by <b>psychrometry</b> at subfreezing temperatures, were identical {{with those of}} ice, indicating equilibrium freezing. Microscopic observations showed extracellular freezing of tissue water. As evidenced by thermal analysis, the freezing process starts with the crystallization of a minor volume which was identified as apoplasmic water. The following long-lasting exotherm indicated slow export {{of water from the}} protoplasts driven by extracellular crystallization. In partially frozen leaves, the fractions of liquid water were measured at several subfreezing temperatures by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. They were consistently greater than those calculated from the osmotic potentials of cellular fluid, and the differences increased with decreasing temperature. About 50 % of the differences could be abolished by freeze-killing of the leaf and was thus ascribed to the effect of a (negative) pressure reinforcing the osmotic potential. The persistent part of the differences may have reflected a matric component. At − 7 °C, the absolute values of both potentials were − 1. 7 megapascals each. The water relations of Pachysandra leaves clearly indicate nonideal equilibrium freezing where negative pressures and matric potentials contribute to the leaf water potential and thus alleviate freeze-dehydration of the tissue...|$|E

In this study, the solute potential of the apoplast and symplast of the second (immature), tenth, twentieth, thirtieth, and fortieth internodes of field-grown sugarcane (Saccharum spp. hybrid) stalk tissue was determined by two independent methods. Solute potential of the apoplast was measured either directly by osmometry from solution collected by centrifugation, or inferred from the initial water potential of fully hydrated tissue determined by thermocouple <b>psychrometry</b> before the tissue was progressively dehydrated for generation of water potential isotherms. Both methods produced nearly identical values ranging from − 0. 6 to − 1. 8 megapascals for immature and mature tissue, respectively. The solute potential of the symplast determined by either method ranged from − 1. 0 to approximately − 2. 2 megapascals for immature and mature internodes, respectively. Solute quantitation by HPLC agreed with concentrations inferred from osmometry. Washing thirtieth internode tissue in deionized water increased pressure potential from 0. 29 to 1. 96 megapascals.

40|$|Thermocouple <b>psychrometry</b> is a {{technique}} that infers the water potential of the liq-uid phase of a sample from measurements within the vapor phase that is in equi-librium with the sample. The theoretical relation between water potential of the liq-uid phase and relative humidity of the vapor phase is given by the Kelvin equation ψ = energy/volume = (RT/Vw) ln(p/po) [3. 2. 3 – 1] where ψ is water potential (sum of matric and osmotic potential, MPa), R is the uni-versal gas constant (8. 314 × 10 − 6 MJ mol− 1 K− 1), T is temperature (K), Vw is molar volume of water (1. 8 × 10 − 5 m 3 mol− 1), and p/po is relative humidity expressed as a fraction where p is actual vapor pressure of air in equilibrium with the liquid phase (MPa) and po is saturation vapor pressure (MPa) at T. Difficulties with the technique arise from two main sources. The first {{stems from the fact}} that relative humidity in the soil gas phase changes only a small amount within the typical range of interest.

The process of going through all design steps of this typical engineering job, and hereby relating every step to the corresponding theory, allows to link theory with a real life example and demonstrate how course topics interact. The goal was to use hand methods not requiring specific software, which forced students to program the related equations in a python notebook, instead of just filling in numbers. Defining boundary conditions, calculating heating and cooling load, estimating a load duration curve, defining base and peak load emission systems, designing the hydraulic and aeraulic distribution system layout and sizing a ground coupled heat pump with direct cooling were required steps in order to finalize the design.

40|$|Hydraulic redistribution, the {{movement}} of water from soil layers of higher water potential to layers of lower water potential through the root systems of plants, has been documented in many taxa worldwide. Hydraulic redistribution is influenced principally by physical properties of roots and soils, and it should occur whenever root systems span soil layers of different water potential. Therefore, hydraulic redistribution should occur through the root systems of plants with aboveground tissue removed or through the root systems of fully senesced plants as long as roots remain intact and hydrated. We examined our hypothesis in field and greenhouse studies with the annual grass Bromus tectorum. We used soil <b>psychrometry</b> to measure soil water potential and performed 2 H-labeling experiments. In the field, following senescence of B. tectorum, we show substantial changes in soil water potential consistent with both upward and downward movement of water through roots. The amount of water redistributed represents {{a significant proportion of}} that which can be stored in the rooted zone. We also experimentally demonstrated upward movement of a 2 H label by roots of senesced plants and by roots of plants without aboveground tissues. In the greenhouse, we further demonstrated redistribution by senesced individuals using a 2 H label. Hydraulic redistribution through the roots of senesced plants should receive further attention because it may have important ecological consequences for soil water recharge, survival of plants through drought, and agricultural practices...|$|E

In V. unguiculata, the leaf water potentials measured by the in situ psychrometer oscillated at the same periodicity as, and proportional to, the leaf conductance. In all species, potentials measured by in situ psychrometers operating in the psychrometric mode were linearly correlated with potentials measured with the pressure chamber. However, the in situ psychrometers underestimated the leaf water potential in the two Helianthus species at low water potentials and overestimated the water potential in P. vera, N. oleander, and C. avellana. The underestimation in the two Helianthus species at low water potentials resulted from differences in water potential across the leaf. The overestimation in P. vera, N. oleander, and C. avellana was considered to arise from low epidermal conductances in these species even after abrasion of the cuticle. Pressure-volume studies with Lycopersicon esculentum showed that less water was expressed from distal than proximal leaflets when the whole leaf was slowly pressurized. The implication of this for water relations characteristics obtained by pressure-volume techniques is discussed.

40|$|Water deficits during seed filling often {{decrease}} seed size in soybean (Glycine max L.). The physiological {{basis for}} this response is not known but may result from direct effects of low seed water potential (Ψw) on the seed filling process. To determine whether low Ψw occurred in reproductive tissues of soybean, we monitored the water status (Ψw, Ψs, and Ψp) of leaf, pericarp, and seed (embryo and testa) tissue of greenhouse-grown plants subjected to a brief water deficit during the linear period of seed growth. Water deficits were imposed by withholding water and monitored in the reproductive tissues by thermocouple <b>psychrometry.</b> When water was abundant, leaf, pericarp, and seed Ψw were − 0. 5 to − 0. 7 megapascal at midday. When water was withheld, leaf Ψw decreased to − 2. 3 megapascals within 6 days. Pericarp Ψw also decreased to − 1. 9 megapascal during this time. Pericarp Ψs followed the decline in Ψw, but osmotic adjustment was not evident as the pericarp lost turgor completely by day 6. However, seed Ψw, Ψs, and Ψp {{were not significantly different}} from the controls. These results indicate that the water status of the developing seeds of soybean is not altered by short-term water deficits severe enough to inhibit the metabolic activity of the maternal plant.

From May until September measurements of stomatal conductance to water vapour (gs) {{were made on}} trees in the chambers. On six out of seven occasions, leaves which had expanded during the first flush (initial shoot extension, during May) in unfiltered air, had lower stomatal conductances, compared with those grown in filtered air; this was significant on three occasions (P < 0. 05). Leaves which expanded {{later in the season}} (second Hush or lammas growth) responded differently to the air quality treatments, with greater stomatal conductances recorded for trees exposed to unfiltered air. Measurements of leaf (<b>psychrometry)</b> and shoot (pressure bomb) water relations indicated that air quality had little effect on turgor pressure (P). Values of solute (?s) and water (?w) potential were higher for trees grown in unfiltered air. Trees were transported to the laboralory for measurement of photosynthesis (A), transpiration (E) and stomatal conductance (gs). Measurements of CO, uptake were also made whilst the CO, concentration within the leaf (Cf) was experimentally controlled (A/Ci analysis). This revealed that higher rates of photosynthesis for lammas leaves grown in unfiltered air were due to enhanced regeneration of RuBP (increased Jmax, P < 0. 08). Carboxylation efficiency (d.

40|$|We {{developed}} a new method to measure the solute concentration in the apoplast of stem tissue involving pressurizing the roots of intact seedlings (Glycine max [L. ] Merr. or Pisum sativum L.), collecting {{a small amount of}} exudate {{from the surface of the}} stem under saturating humidities, and determining the osmotic potential of the solution with a micro-osmometer capable of measuring small volumes (0. 5 microliter). In the elongating region, the apoplast concentrations were very low (equivalent to osmotic potentials of − 0. 03 to − 0. 04 megapascal) and negligible compared to the water potential of the apoplast (− 0. 15 to − 0. 30 megapascal) measured directly by isopiestic <b>psychrometry</b> in intact plants. Most of the apoplast water potential consisted of a negative pressure that could be measured with a pressure chamber (− 0. 15 to − 0. 28 megapascal). Tests showed that earlier methods involving infiltration of intercellular spaces or pressurizing cut segments caused solute to be released to the apoplast and resulted in spuriously high concentrations. These results indicate that, although a small amount of solute is present in the apoplast, the major component is a tension that is part of a growth-induced gradient in water potential in the enlarging tissue. The gradient originates from the extension of the cell walls, which prevents turgor from reaching its maximum and creates a growth-induced water potential that causes water to move from the xylem at a rate that satisfies the rate of enlargement. The magnitude of the gradient implies that growing tissue contains a large resistance to water movement...|$|E
40|$|The {{global demand}} for Nordic wild berries has {{increased}} steadily, {{partly due to}} their healthy properties and their good taste. Juice concentrate is produced by pressing berries and heating up the juice. The by-products are berry skins and seeds. Traditionally, the by-products have been composted. Higher competiveness {{can be achieved by}} decreasing the production cost and increasing the product values. The berry skins and seeds have a commercial value since they are rich in vitamins and nutrients. To use and sell these by-products, they need to be separated from each other and dried to a moisture content of less than 10 %wt. A berry juice industry in the north of Sweden has been studied in order to increase the energy and resource efficiency and optimize the quality and yield of different berry fractions. This was done by means of process integration with thermodynamics and <b>psychrometry</b> along with measurements of the berry juice production processes. Our calculations show that the drying system could be operated at full without any external heat supply. This could be achieved by increasing the efficiency of the dryer by recirculating 80 % of the drying air and by heating the air with heat from the flue gases from the industrial boiler. This change would decrease the need for heat in the dryer with about 64 %. The total heat use for the plant could thereby be decreased from 1204 kW to 1039 kW. The proposed changes could be done without compromising the production quality or the lead time.
