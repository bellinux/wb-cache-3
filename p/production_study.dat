40|$|This chapter applies a materialist, {{ecological}} {{approach to}} analyze the physical environment in which media production takes place, focusing on media-related occupations across global supply chains. We argue that conventional <b>production</b> <b>studies</b> have too narrowly circumscribed this sector and that more comprehensive research on media production labor is needed. We critique the idealism and pro-growth ideology that draws <b>production</b> <b>studies</b> toward both a focus on consciousness and the so-called aristocracy of talent.

Most schools, including Yang's, had closed {{during and after the}} chaos of the Xinhai Revolution, and therefore in 1912 Yang decided to return to his home village and establish a school, acting as its headmaster. He also founded an agricultural association, and was asked to serve as its chair.

He graduated as the school's valedictorian in 1917, and began practicing law at an office in Wuchang.

40|$|Abstract We {{present a}} {{semantic}} theory of causal discourse which {{allows us to}} derive expectations about upcoming discourse, specifically when to expect various types of explanations. We apply our theory to the phenomenon of implicit causality and show how the semantics of implicit causality verbs interacts with discourse structure. In particular, we show why certain verbs trigger explanations per default, what kind of explanations are triggered, and why these explanations {{are closely related to}} specific coreference patterns. Predictions derived from the theory were tested in a large-scale crosslinguistic <b>production</b> <b>study</b> comparing discourse continuations in German and Norwegian – two languages which display differing discourse structuring properties. The <b>production</b> <b>study</b> fully confirmed our predictions, with explanation types and implicit causality bias distributing as expected. The study furthermore reveals that our semantic account of implicit causality is cross-linguistically valid. ...|$|E

40|$|Foods {{differ in}} their satiating capacity. Satiety {{peptides}} may help to provide evidence for biological mechanisms behind these differences. The aim {{of this paper was}} to discuss the physiological relevance of three individual appetite peptides, i. e. CCK, GLP- 1 and PYY, in assessing the satiating capacity of foods. A literature research was conducted on CCK, GLP- 1, PYY and satiety; effective exogenous infusion <b>studies</b> and endogenous <b>production</b> <b>studies,</b> i. e. changes induced by foods, were identified. The relative changes in blood concentrations in these studies were compared in order to assess an indication of the physiological relevance of the peptides. Relative changes in the two types of studies investigating CCK overlapped, i. e. increases in serum were 3 to 14 -fold in effective exogenous studies (n = 7) and 2 to 8 -fold in endogenous <b>production</b> <b>studies</b> (n = 9). The relative changes in GLP- 1 and PYY did not overlap; GLP- 1 : 4 to 16 fold in effective exogenous studies (n = 4) and no effect to 4 fold in endogenous <b>production</b> <b>studies</b> (n = 38). PYY: 3 to 11 -fold in effective exogenous studies (n = 14) and no effect to 2 -fold in endogenous <b>production</b> <b>studies</b> (n = 10). GLP- 1 and PYY show effects on satiety at supra-physiological dosages, they are not likely to contribute individually to a difference in satiating capacity of foods and can therefore not be interpreted in isolation. The effects of CCK are likely to be in the physiological range and therefore may have an individual contribution to a difference in satiating capacity between food...|$|R
