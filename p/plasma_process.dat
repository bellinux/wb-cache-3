In particular, in tissue engineering, biomaterials need to be totally integrated with biological systems {{in order to be}} employed as substitutes of artificial prostheses. Since most materials do not allow a correct integration with the biological environment, <b>plasma</b> <b>processes</b> have been demonstrated to be very versatile in altering the material surface properties in order to improve the biocompatibility of materials. The challenge is to plasma modify 3 D scaffolds in order to be used for in vivo regeneration of human tissues. The correct 3 D biointegration inside living tissues is the crucial objective, towards which many aspects are directed, from the material engineering to its surface modification and affinity with the biological environment. In this paper, the advances in low pressure <b>plasma</b> <b>processes,</b> applied to both 2 D rigid substrates and 3 D porous structures, are discussed.

Unlike oxy-fuel cutting, the PAC process can be applied to cutting metals which form refractory oxides such as stainless steel, cast iron, aluminum, and other non-ferrous alloys. Since PAC was introduced by Praxair Inc. at the American Welding Society show in 1954, many process refinements, gas developments, and equipment improvements have occurred.|$|E
50|$|Carbon nanotube-plasma polymer-based amperometric biosensors for ultrasensitive glucose {{detection}} {{have been}} fabricated. Two amperometric enzyme biosensors were fabricated. One had single wall nanotubes {{and the other}} multi wall nanotubes, however, plasma-polymerized thin films (PPFs) were incorporated into both. A mixture of the enzyme glucose oxidase (GOD) and a CNT film was sandwiched with 10-nm-thick acetonitrile PPFs. A PPF layer was deposited onto a sputtered gold electrode. In order to facilitate the electrochemical communication between the CNT layer and GOD, CNTs were treated with oxygen plasma. The device with single-walled CNTs showed a sensitivity {{higher than that of}} multi walled CNTs. The glucose biosensor showed ultrasensitivity (a sensitivity of 40 µA mM-1 cm-2, a correlation coefficient of 0.992, a linear response range of 0.025 -1.9 mM, a detection limit of 6.2 µM at S/N = 3, +0.8V vs Ag/AgCl), and a rapid response (<4 seconds in reaching 95% of maximum response). This high performance is attributed to the fact that CNTs have excellent electrocatalytic activity and enhance electron transfer, and that PPFs and/or the <b>plasma</b> <b>process</b> for CNTs are an enzyme-friendly platform, i.e., a suitable design of the interface between GOD and CNTs.|$|E
