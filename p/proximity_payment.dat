40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to propose a {{solution}} for a potential vulnerability in mobile <b>proximity</b> <b>payment.</b> The mobile <b>proximity</b> <b>payment</b> is the evolution of the card payment whose reference standard is EMV (Europay, MasterCard and VISA). A mobile <b>proximity</b> <b>payment</b> transaction is performed via radio waves so there is the possibility to intercept the communication with the point-of-sale and also to activate the payer device, in a range of 10 cm. The EMV protocol assumes that within a range of 10 cm card fraud is hard to perform, moreover IC card capable point of sale are considered safe a priori, while the card must authenticate itself. This allows a leak of card information. In this paper we describe a possible solution to this problem, adding a safe level to the EMV protocol in the case of mobile <b>proximity</b> <b>payment</b> transactions.

40|$|Abstract Purpose – Technological {{innovations}} continuously {{impact the}} daily routines of consumers. In {{the case of}} mobile devices, their multifunctionality revolutionizes possibilities for consumers, for example by conducting mobile payments at a point of sale (<b>proximity</b> <b>payments).</b> Despite the advantages of mobile payment services, the number of users of these services is very low among German consumers. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} paper is to examine barriers which impede German consumers from adopting <b>proximity</b> mobile <b>payments</b> by applying the theory of innovation resistance. More specifically, this paper analyzes these obstacles regarding the usage barrier, value barrier, risk barrier, tradition barrier, image barrier and the added information barrier. Methodology – By utilizing a quantitative research approach with online self- completion questionnaires, 152 answers from German consumers were collected and statistically analyzed in order to empirically test the model of innovation resistance. In addition, the characteristics age and smartphone usage behavior of the participants were analyzed for examining further characteristics of the consumers. Findings – The results indicate that out of the examined six barriers, the tradition, risk and value barrier have proven to be significant in influencing the adoption intention of the questioned German consumers towards mobile payment services. Additionally, a connection between the characteristics age and smartphone usage behavior and the adoption intention could be detected. Research implications – A key finding is that an innovation resistance behavior among German consumers towards mobile payment exists according to this study. This paper provides recommendations for service providers for reducing the identified barriers and the consumer resistance for a successful breakthrough of the innovation of mobile payment. Originality/Contribution – This paper contributes to theory by applying the less studied perspective of innovation resistance to the research field of mobile payment, which is a novelty. Furthermore, insights into German consumers were given helping service providers to develop effective marketing strategies to meet the need of the consumers.

The smartphones are capable tostore everything that would normally be carried in a physical wallet andalso allows the users to make payments anytime and anywhere. The potentialadded-values of mobile payments, such as generating new revenues, obtaining newusers, increasing user stickiness attracted different players to expand theirbusinesses to the mobile payment services, including financial institutions,mobile network operators, mobile device manufacturers, trusted third partyproviders. To compete in the market, they explored differenttechnologies and business models {{which resulted in the}} complexity and dynamicsof the mobile payment market. Consequently, mobile payments have only become astandard practice in a few countries. In termsof proximity payments, NFC is widelyviewed {{as one of the most}} promising technologiesdue to its security features, compatibility with the existing financialinfrastructures, and ease of use. In the Chinese market, compared with QR code,NFC was first introduced and supported by various players. However, the Chinesemobile <b>proximity</b> <b>payment</b> market has become the largest and fastest-growingmobile <b>proximity</b> <b>payment</b> market in the world in few years by utilising QR code. The market is highly concentrated withAlipay and Tenpay which are QR code-based mobile payment platforms. In otherwords, QR code overtook NFC and became the most popular mobile proximitypayment technology in China.   Considering this phenomenon, the main researchquestion in this study is set as"why did QR code-based mobile payments overtake NFC and achieve a dominantposition in the Chinese market?". In orderto answer this question, the research work is conducted in three steps. Firstly, a historical review of the Chinese mobile proximity payments isperformed to identify the mainstream mobile <b>proximity</b> <b>payment</b> solutions basedon QR code and NFC technologies and corresponding business models adopted inthe Chinese market. Secondly, a desk research is conducted to determine thebarriers that mobile payment providers and users face towards to QR code andNFC-based mobile payment solutions using a multi-perspectiveframework. To obtain the situation in the Chinese market and also triangulatethe results of the desk research, in-depth interviews are conducted with technical experts and manager from the Chinesemobile payment industry. Lastly, a proposed research model is used to analysethe strategic actions of the mobile payment providers who support differenttechnological solutions, how they develop the mobile payment platforms andfacilitate users’ adoption of their mobile <b>proximity</b> <b>payment</b> services in theChinese market.   In this study, the research model is developed basedon relevant business model, platform andbusiness ecosystem theories. The final research model consists of three connectedperspectives which are platform technology, platform ecosystems and platformservices. It is applied to three Chinesemobile payment platforms, namely, He Wallet, Alipay and QuickPass which have implemented one or several technologicalsolutions based on NFC and QR code technologies. The data for the casestudies is collected from thesemi-structured interviews and the desk research. The results showed that althoughNFC technology was adopted first in the Chinese market, the enablingdevices of both consumers and merchants were not widely ready at that time forNFC technology, but good enough for QR code technology. However, the early NFCadopters (both MNOs and financial institutions) were reluctant to make a huge investment inthe enabling devices to realise the large-scale deployment in the early stagedue to the uncertainties on the technology level and the unclear roles andbenefits on the business aspect. Thereby, they missed the best time to captureuser and develop users' habit. In contrast, Alipay strategically adopted the independent service provider mode to leverage its obtained platformresources and capabilities whichsignificantly contributed the mass adoption of QR code in the Chinese market. DespiteQR code currently dominated the Chinese mobile payment market, it is believedthat NFC has its place in the Chinese mobile payment market as China UnionPayadopted an open platform strategy to incorporateall relevant players into its ecosystemto facilitate the development of NFC-based mobile payments.   The research results in this study are not onlybeneficial to the theoretical research in mobile payments but also useful forthe practical development of mobile payments. From the theoretical perspective,this research provides a comprehensive overview of the characteristics andpotential barriers of four technologicalsolutions based on NFC and QR code technologies. Besides, it developed aresearch model which can be used to interpret the status of a mobile paymentplatform. From practical perspective, itprovides some insights to the mobile payment providers in terms of the technology selection, the design of the businessmodel, the service development and the marketing strategies.

Cost considerations do not influence MPP adoption intention. Based on these findings we expect that MPP systems have a high chance to be widely adopted if optimized for compatibility...|$|E

40|$|This paper explores how {{the control}} over the Near Field Communication (NFC) secure element could provide {{platform}} leadership in the mobile payment ecosystem. During a decade of trials, firms from dif-ferent industries struggled to launch <b>proximity</b> mo-bile <b>payment</b> platforms to pay at physical point-of-sales. Mobile payments platforms are complex socio-technical systems that need to combine an array of resources and capabilities from different firms. The implementation of NFC platforms requires to store financial credentials of consumers in a secure ele-ment (SE). The industry designed several competing platform architectures for the secure element: SIM-centric, device-centric, SD-centric, and Host Card Emulation (HCE). Each of these alternatives gave more or less control to the different firms involved in the mobile payment ecosystem. For years, firms pro-moted the architecture which would give them more control. Over the time, this struggle just hindered the emergence of successful mobile payment platforms. The recent emergence of new actors (e. g., Google, Ap-ple, Samsung) raised optimistic prospects for future developments. This paper provides a strategic analy-sis of the mobile payment ecosystem by studying the relationship between SE architectures and the estab-lishment of platform leadership by incumbents and emerging actors. ...|$|R
40|$|MBA - WBSMobile phones have {{transformed}} {{the telecommunications industry}} profoundly. Phones are equipped with functionalities that open up new business opportunities to mobile network operators, banks and merchants. Near Field Communication (NFC) is a contactless application {{that can be applied}} within a mobile phone to enable it transact very much like a mobile credit card or wallet. The mobile payments environment continues to evolve with various stakeholders and business models emerging worldwide. Each stakeholder is motivated by their own set of business case drivers to either pursue or reject the move towards mobile payments. Revenue sharing arrangements associated with any of the potential business models represent both a point of great potential competitive friction and ultimately the key to a break-through for rapid deployment of mobile payments. Drawing on the international studies of mobile payments, this report evaluates the possible business models and revenue sharing arrangements that could potentially evolve in the South African mobile payments environment. The report also examines the reasons and business case drivers for merchants to adopt the technology and “self-organised” solutions. Lastly, the paper includes an analysis of the possible disruptions that this technology could cause. The assumption is made that mobile payment solutions will replace cash and card based solutions and become the payment instrument of choice as it offers more processing power capabilities than cash and cards. The research methodology employed in this study was qualitative and utilised semi-structured in-depth interviews where the content of transcripts were analysed. Thirteen interviews were held with mobile payment industry experts and practitioners in banks, mobile network operators and interchange companies. The research elicited some interesting findings. Collaboration was regarded as the most feasible business model and respondents believed that the answer to iii revenue sharing lay within the value that each stakeholder brings to the mobile <b>proximity</b> <b>payments</b> environment. Merchants {{play a key role in}} the mobile payments environment and their motivation to adopt the technology relies on the cost benefit continuum. Merchants are motivated to adopt the technology if it reduces cash handling, lower shrinkage, increases throughput and reduces the risk in terms of theft. Merchant “self-organised” solutions in competition with banks and mobile network operators is a possibility; but an unlikely option considering the recent deployment cost of upgrading payment infrastructure for contactless smart card technology in South Africa. Merchants encountered large capital expenditure during the latter upgrade and they would rather take a “wait and see” approach. Lastly, it is unlikely that mobile payment solutions will replace cash and card based solutions except for specific niche markets such as transportation and fast food restaurants. Both cash and cards as payment solutions are linked to customers’ perception of the “prestige” of using these payment solutions...|$|R

Academic background and methodology: The theoretical foundations of this research lie in technology and innovation acceptance related models. The proposed research model combines different theories including technology acceptance theory, switching barrier theory, diffusion of innovation theory, theory of perceived risks and <b>proximity</b> <b>payment</b> specific usefulness factors including transaction speed and transaction convenience. The empirical study is based on a data collected with an on online survey during spring 2013. The statistical method used to analyse the sample of 201 respondents' answers is Partial Least Squares analysis. Findings and conclusions: According to the research, the strongest determinant of consumers' use intention for both card and mobile payments is compatibility. Perceived risks have negative effect on intention to use both payment methods and this effect is especially emphasised on mobile based payments. There are also mentionable differences in the determinants of perceived risk. When assessing the risks related to card based NFC payments consumers tend to put emphasis on privacy related concerns whereas security concerns were highlighted with NFC mobile payments. Perceived usefulness of the system, for which perceived transaction convenience was found out to be the strongest determinant, has positive effect on both payment methods but this effect was slightly stronger for mobile payments. Perceived ease of use has a direct positive effect on use intention in terms of card based payments and with mobile payments it affects the system's perceived usefulness. In addition, there were also differences in the external factors behind use intention. With card based payments, consumers see the attractiveness of current alternatives as a negative factor towards intended usage but the data did not provide evidence for this in terms of mobile based NFC payments.

40|$|The {{worldwide}} mobile payments {{market is}} expected to have reached “$ 171. 5 billion as a total in 2012, with a 61. 9 % increase compared to 2011 ” and a constant annual forecasted growth of 42 % until 2016 according to (Christy, 2012, para. 1). In this fast growing market, there are two major categories identified, according to (Cluckey, 2011, p. 1) : proximity and remote payments. For the mobile proximity case, NFC is a technology that has seen a tremendous hype in the last years. However, barcode and QR code are also relevant and are addressed in the analysis section as well. NFC is a set of wireless standards based technology, that functions in short distance radio frequency identification (RFID) of approximately 4 inches and that can be applied in areas from simple data transfers to payments, by replacing credit card, according to (Hasoo, Lee, & Heekuck Oh, 2013). The same source mentions that the protocol is extremely secure, by granting privacy of the user and in the same time enabling personalized services, fact seen as very suitable for its usage in mobile payments services. Thus, in mobile proximity payments, NFC is a set of standards that enable device-to-device communication between mobile phones and other pieces of equipment, such as POS terminals. The thesis focuses mainly on NFC “self-organized” phone-based schemes, (J. Ondrus & Pigneur, 2005, p. 2), owned by players such as Google, PayPal and A Handset Manufacturer that are looking forward to enter the market from outside and thus cause disruption in relation to the already existing initiatives, the “operator-driven ones” (J. Ondrus & Pigneur, 2005, p. 2), where the banks and MNOs take the lead together. In the current thesis, the concept of the operator-driven models is extended to that of collaboration models(Smart Card Alliance, 2008), referred here as the collaborative models. These type of models are already working according to the functional standardized “four corners card payment working model” (LLC, 2010, p. 1) and have the banks as leaders in network in charge of payments, and the mobile network operators, responsible for storing the payment credentials in the mobile handsets. According to (LLC, 2010), the four corners card payment model links the buyer and the merchants through their issuing and acquiring banks, by making use of the card schemes companies (ex. Visa, MasterCard, Maestro). Thus, these so called “disruptive or insurgent players” (Jan Ondrus & Lyytinen, 2011,p. 2) have different organizational models compared to what is considered the traditional, reference one, in their attempt to step in the in-store payment by making use of NFC or other proximity payments technologies. Thus, companies such as Google, PayPal, and A Handset Manufacturer might find themselves in a position to exploit at maximum their resources and chose suitable strategies in relation to the other actors to gain support for initiatives and so reach success, by giving a high value for the network they are part of. Taking into account this problem, the research question to be answered is the following: What kind of network strategies should new-coming players in the mobile <b>proximity</b> <b>payment</b> market Google, PayPal and A Handset Manufacturer deploy in relation to the most relevant actors in their networks, in order to ensure their successfulness in the international market? For answering the research question, the author has created a theoretical framework that is applied to reach the research objective. It is important to emphasize that when referring to strategies, the researcher refers to certain manners the owners of the three disruptive ecosystems should treat the relation with the most important actors in their network in order to obtain support and obtain “multiple sourcing” for their models (Bruijn & Ten Heuvelhof, 2008, p. 41). That is why he names them “network strategies”. For this, {{it should be noted that}} the researcher considers that the more support in the network an owner of a certain value proposition has, the higher the chances for reaching success are. That is because he views success mainly from the perspective of the value delivered inside the value network. That means that certain “blocking parties” or parties with “diffuse power position” (Bruijn & Ten Heuvelhof, 2008, p. 40 - 41) should be dealt with in such a manner that more support is built with them and blockage is avoided. On the other hand, parties with “production power” should be kept close to the value proposition and involved in key decisions and benefits sharing. In order to measure the potential success of the disruptors and, based on that, derive the degree of successfulness of the strategies, the researcher has created a successfulness indicator, based on a network approach. This indicator measures success by taking into account the roles of the most important actors in the network (ex. how many supporters, blockers). The research approach taken to solve the problem is that of comparative analysis, between the roles that the most important actors (ex. banks, MNOs, card payment scheme) have in the new entrants’ ecosystems (Google, PayPal and A Handset Manufacturer) vis-à-vis their considered, static roles in the collaborative, traditional, operator-centric model. The latter is used as a reference, because it is considered in this research as the traditional, established model of performing mobile payments, as being based on the already standardized four corners model. In addition, all the critical parties seem to align their interests and thus increase the value for the all network in this case, thus labeling this model as Highly successful. As this latter model is considered a reference, it is the change in roles for the most important actors in the three disruptive networks compared to it that is relevant for giving insights regarding successfulness and then right network strategies that should be recommended. In order to be able to gather information about the case studies analyzed and then clarify the roles of the parties and then also quantify success, the researcher makes use of a business model based on platform theory called VISOR. For the collaborative model, the researcher uses a simple stakeholder analysis. As a manner of gathering data, the researcher has performed two sets of interviews. The first set was focused on gathering information about the business models of the disruptors and of the collaborative case. For this, he retrieved information from 7 consultants working for THE CLIENT, as well as consulting specialized materials about mobile payments. The second set of interviews was used in order to clarify the roles of the most important actors (ex. banks, card payment schemes and banks), by involving 7 experienced experts belonging to the entire mobile payments field. This set of interviews was recorded, transcribed and coded. The conclusions of the research are that Google scores “Low” as successfulness potential, PayPal “Low towards Medium”, whereas A Handset Manufacturer’s model is labeled as “High”. This is placed in the context where the reference, the collaborative model, is also labeled as High. That justification of these results is given by the fact that whereas Google has 3 major blockers and no supporters in its network on its Google Wallet’s product and PayPal has only 2, but still no major supporters, A Handset Manufacturer’s model is backed by 3 strong parties and 2 that seem possible to be activated. Thus, the researcher argues that the network strategies of A Handset Manufacturer’s are potentially more successful than Google’s and PayPal’s. Google is advised to bring banks and card payments schemes closer to the Google Wallet initiative, PayPal to strengthen the relationship with the banks for its close loop mobile in-store payment model, whereas A Handset Manufacturer’s should continue to focus on the relationship with the banks and build scale.

This represents roughly 40.8 % of the municipalities in which the Juntos program was present in 2009. Nevertheless, when expanding the sample using the survey weights from the sampling design, Perova and Vakis (2012) find that the number of households which report receiving cash transfers from Juntos surveyed in the ENAHO 2009 is very close to the actual number of beneficiary households listed in the program’s official records.

3000|$|The {{different}} {{characteristics of}} utilization and progress {{decisions in the}} domain of time lead us to derive separate hypotheses for the impact of the time delay between subsequent decisions on the sunk-cost effect. Again, we first focus on utilization decisions. Prelec and Loewenstein (1998) integrate Thaler’s (1980, 1985) idea of mental accounts in an evaluation of consumption and payment events. They specify that consumers feel the pain of paying at the time of product purchase, which must be deducted from the pleasure of consumption. Their model comes with two main assumptions: prospective accounting and coupling. Prospective accounting postulates that consumers mentally depreciate past payments, but consider future payments in their full amount. In coupling, individuals create a psychological link between the payment and the consumption of a transaction. In line with their argumentation, coupling moderates the impact of payment on consumption such that the pain of paying attenuates consumption utility and the consumption pleasure buffers the pain of paying. The imputed costs are the highest right after payment and decrease over time. Gourville and Soman (1998) label this gradual adaptation to sunk costs {{with the passage of time}} as payment depreciation. Consequently, the sunk-cost effect should be more present in temporal <b>proximity</b> to the <b>payment.</b> Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis: [...]...|$|R
