Metkut, a powdered mixture of several dals and a few spices is {{also a part of}} traditional Deshastha cuisine. Deshastha use black spice mix or kala, literally black, masala, in cooking. Traditionally, each family had their own recipe for the spice mix. However, this tradition is dying out as modern households buy <b>pre-packaged</b> mixed spice directly from supermarkets. Puran poli for festivals and {{on the first day of}} the two-day marriage is another Marathi Brahmin special dish.|$|E

5|$|Hershey Creamery Company, {{also known}} as Hershey's Ice Cream, is a creamery that {{produces}} Hershey's brand ice cream, sorbet, sherbet, and frozen yogurt, and other frozen treats such as smoothies and frozen slab style ice cream mixers. Founded by Jacob Hershey and four of his brothers in 1894 (all of whom have no relation to Milton S. Hershey and the chocolate company that he founded, also in 1894), it {{was taken over by}} the Holder family in the 1920s. The company {{was one of the first}} to offer consumers <b>pre-packaged</b> ice cream pints. In 1998, it modernized its operations to increase efficiency and reduce overhead. With their shared names and cities of origin, Hershey Creamery and Hershey Company have had a tumultuous relationship marked by multiple lawsuits over trademark issues. In the mid-1990s, the companies settled their most recent legal battles out of court, with the creamery agreeing to add a disclaimer to its ice cream products to note that it is not affiliated with The Hershey Company.|$|E

Similarly most jars of jam and packs of sausages are labelled 454g with no imperial indicator.|$|E
25|$|On August 26, 2010, {{news media}} {{reported}} that Blockbuster {{was planning to}} file a <b>pre-packaged</b> Chapter 11 bankruptcy in mid-September. In light of this news, the company's chief financial officer (CFO), Tom Casey, resigned on September 11. He was replaced by Dennis McGill, formerly CFO of Safety-Kleen Systems, Inc. On September 23, 2010, Blockbuster filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection due to challenging losses, $900 million in debt, and strong competition from Netflix, Redbox, and video on-demand services. Movie Gallery/Hollywood Video had filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation earlier in 2010 for similar reasons.|$|E
25|$|Many {{sectors of}} the {{industry}} did agree to a programme coordinated by the Metrication Board, with metrication of <b>pre-packaged</b> goods being introduced on a commodity by commodity basis. In 1977 when a carpet retailing chain reneged on an industry-wide agreement to use metric units (carpeting at £8.36 per square yard being much more appealing to the customer than carpeting at £10.00 per square metre), it became necessary {{for the first time}} to use legislation to enforce metrication rather than to rely on a voluntary adoption of the system.|$|E
25|$|When the Metrication Board was {{abolished}} in 1980, agreement {{had been}} reached with the EEC {{regarding the use of}} certain imperial measures until the end of 1989, a date that was subsequently extended to 1999. By this date most <b>pre-packaged</b> goods were sold in metric quantities with loose goods and goods weighed in front of the customer continuing to be sold in imperial quantities. In 1999, when the British Government allowed the derogation for the use of imperial units to lapse, all goods (apart from beer, cider and milk in returnable containers) had to be priced in metric units.|$|E

An oxygen garden was also recommended to provide oxygen for the ship and to enable the crew to grow their own food rather than rely completely on <b>pre-packaged</b> sustenance. Boyle met with a department within NASA that was focused on the psychology of deep-space travel, and they advised the director that regular Earth routines like preparing one's own food, enjoying its consumption and cleaning up afterwards are activities crucial to an astronaut's sanity.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though it}} is a very old industry, meat {{production}} continues to be shaped strongly by the evolving demands of customers. The trend towards selling meat in <b>pre-packaged</b> cuts has increased the demand for larger breeds of cattle, which are better suited to producing such cuts. Even more animals not previously exploited for their meat are now being farmed, especially the more agile and mobile species, whose muscles tend to be developed better than those of cattle, sheep or pigs. Examples are the various antelope species, the zebra, water buffalo and camel, as well as non-mammals, such as the crocodile, emu and ostrich. Another important trend in contemporary meat production is organic farming which, while providing no organoleptic benefit to meat so produced, meets an increasing demand for organic meat.|$|E

500|$|The term {{bacon in}} this book does not refer to the sliced and <b>pre-packaged</b> bacon that is {{ubiquitous}} in American markets, but instead the cured whole side of the pig. Furthermore, the differences between bacon in the United States and in the United Kingdom are quite pronounced, and the book refers only to cuts common in the United Kingdom. The cut {{that is used to}} produce [...] "American bacon" [...] is a cut referred to as [...] "streaky bacon" [...] in the United Kingdom. Most bacon consumed in the United Kingdom is known as back bacon and consists of both pork belly and pork loin in a single cut.

500|$|In the 1920s, {{the company}} was merged with the Holder family's Bethlehem-based Meyer Dairy Company, {{retaining}} the Hershey name. In 1926, with demand for the ice cream exceeding {{the capacity of the}} farmhouse, the newly merged company constructed its first ice cream plant in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. During the Great Depression, the company became the first ice cream maker to offer its products in <b>pre-packaged</b> pints. It began creating new flavors of ice cream which it then sold to other ice cream makers. Following World War II, the company continued to answer the call for greater convenience in consumer foods and expanded its offerings to include single-serve, easy to eat items such as popsicles and ice cream sandwiches. In the 1960s, the Holder family assumed full ownership of the company.|$|E

500|$|Dwellers of the Forbidden City is an {{adventure}} module, or <b>pre-packaged</b> adventure booklet, {{ready for use}} by Dungeon Masters in the Dungeons & Dragons (D) fantasy role-playing game. The adventure was first used as a module for tournament play at the 1980 Origins Game Fair, and was later published by TSR in 1981 for use with the first edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons rules. The module was written by game designer David [...] "Zeb" [...] Cook, who partly ascribes his hiring by TSR to his work on this module. In the adventure, the characters are hired to find an object taken to a lost oriental-style city, which has {{been taken over by}} a cult of snake-worshipers, the yuan-ti, and their servants, the mongrelmen and tasloi. The module was ranked as the 13th greatest Dungeons & Dragons adventure of all time by Dungeon magazine for the 30th anniversary of the Dungeons & Dragons game in 2004.|$|E

In 1971, he helped develop Chainmail, a miniatures wargame based on medieval warfare. He co-founded the company Tactical Studies Rules (TSR, Inc.) with childhood friend Don Kaye in 1973. The following year, he and Arneson created D, which expanded on Gygax's Chainmail and included elements of the fantasy stories he loved as a child. In the same year, he founded The Dragon, a magazine based around the new game. In 1977, Gygax began work on a more comprehensive version of the game, called Advanced Dungeons & Dragons. Gygax designed numerous manuals for the game system, {{as well as several}} <b>pre-packaged</b> adventures called [...] "modules" [...] that gave a person running a D game (the [...] "Dungeon Master") a rough script and ideas on how to run a particular gaming scenario. In 1983, he worked to license the D product line into the successful D cartoon series.|$|E
