The <b>population</b> <b>grew</b> in the summers {{with the arrival of}} migratory fishermen. In 1680, fishing ships (mostly from South Devon) set up fishing rooms at St. John's, bringing hundreds of Irish men into the port to operate inshore fishing boats.|$|E

Geometric <b>populations</b> <b>grow</b> in reproductive generations between intervals of abstinence from reproduction. Exponential <b>populations</b> <b>grow</b> without designated periods for reproduction. Reproduction is a continuous process and generations of reproduction overlap. This graph illustrates two hypothetical populations - one <b>population</b> <b>growing</b> periodically (and therefore geometrically) {{and the other}} <b>population</b> <b>growing</b> continuously (and therefore exponentially). The populations in the graph have a doubling time of 1 year. The populations in the graph are hypothetical. In reality, the doubling times differ between populations.|$|R

Farm <b>population</b> <b>grows</b> faster (or declines more slowly) in counties with relatively high farm income, and nonfarm <b>populations</b> <b>grow</b> faster in counties with relatively high nonfarm income. However, higher farm incomes lead to slower nonfarm population growth and vice versa.

40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} branching random {{walks in}} d-dimensional integer lattice with time–space i. i. d. offspring distributions. This model {{is known to}} exhibit a phase transition: If d≥ 3 and the environment is “not too random”, then, the total <b>population</b> <b>grows</b> as fast as its expectation with strictly positive probability. If, on the other hand, d≤ 2, or the environment is “random enough”, then the total <b>population</b> <b>grows</b> strictly slower than its expectation almost surely. We show the equivalence between the slow population growth and a natural localization property in terms of “replica overlap”.

Societal complexity is then potentially threatened if it develops beyond what is actually sustainable, and a disorderly reorganization were to follow. The scissors model of Malthusian collapse, where the <b>population</b> <b>grows</b> without limit and resources do not, is the idea of great opposing environmental forces cutting into each other.|$|R

5|$|Cheddar is {{recognised}} as a village. The adjacent {{settlement of}} Axbridge, although {{only about a}} third the population of Cheddar, is a town. This apparently illogical situation is explained by the relative importance of the two places in historic times.
