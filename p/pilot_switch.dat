5|$|A-10s were {{initially}} an unwelcome addition {{to many in}} the Air Force. Most <b>pilots</b> <b>switching</b> to the A-10 {{did not want to}} because fighter pilots traditionally favored speed and appearance. In 1987, many A-10s were shifted to the forward air control (FAC) role and redesignated OA-10. In the FAC role, the OA-10 is typically equipped with up to six pods of 2.75inch (70mm) Hydra rockets, usually with smoke or white phosphorus warheads used for target marking. OA-10s are physically unchanged and remain fully combat capable despite the redesignation.|$|R

50|$|July 15, 1995: A Beechcraft C35 Bonanza, {{registration}} number N1997D, struck {{a tree and}} crashed in a field in Plano, Texas 0.5 mi (0.8 km) north of Air Park-Dallas after experiencing a loss of power during the final landing approach; the aircraft suffered substantial damage, the pilot suffered minor injuries, and a passenger was seriously injured. While the aircraft was en route from Lancaster Airport and nearing Air Park-Dallas, the engine had lost power when the <b>pilot</b> <b>switched</b> to the auxiliary fuselage fuel tank, so the pilot selected the left main wing tank and {{did not attempt to}} switch tanks again when the engine lost power for the second time. NTSB accident investigators discovered that the left main tank and fuselage tank were both nearly empty, and attributed the crash to fuel starvation caused by the <b>pilot's</b> failure to <b>switch</b> to the right main wing tank, which still contained an adequate amount of fuel.|$|R
50|$|The {{air traffic}} {{controller}} instructed to follow the established corridor Troitskoe. Mild stratocumulus clouds were present along the designated route. At an altitude of 4,000 meters the aircraft ceased communications with Khabarovsk air traffic control, proceeding along the designated route. At 21:39 local time the <b>pilot</b> <b>switched</b> {{air traffic controller}}s, and after receiving permission started increasing altitude to 8,000 meters. The aircraft started experiencing control difficulties at 4,500 meters, approximately 1 minute and 37 seconds after the last communications with air traffic control. The pilots expressed dismay at the sharp roll of the wings; the aircraft disappeared from radar 36 seconds later, crashing into a swamp. All passengers and crew {{were killed in the}} crash.|$|R
50|$|Relays {{are used}} {{wherever}} {{it is necessary to}} control a high power or high voltage circuit with a low power circuit, especially when galvanic isolation is desirable. The first application of relays was in long telegraph lines, where the weak signal received at an intermediate station could control a contact, regenerating the signal for further transmission. High-voltage or high-current devices can be controlled with small, low voltage wiring and <b>pilots</b> <b>switches.</b> Operators can be isolated from the high voltage circuit. Low power devices such as microprocessors can drive relays to control electrical loads beyond their direct drive capability. In an automobile, a starter relay allows the high current of the cranking motor to be controlled with small wiring and contacts in the ignition key.|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{consider}} the problem of anomaly detection in heterogeneous, multivariate, variable-length time series datasets. Our {{focus is on the}} aviation safety domain, where data objects are flights and time series are sensor readings and <b>pilot</b> <b>switches.</b> In this context the goal is to detect anomalous flight segments, due to mechanical, environmental, or human factors in order to identifying operationally significant events and provide insights into the flight operations and highlight otherwise unavailable potential safety risks and precursors to accidents. For this purpose, we propose a framework which represents each flight using a semi-Markov switching vector autoregressive (SMS-VAR) model. Detection of anomalies is then based on measuring dissimilarities between the model's prediction and data observation. The framework is scalable, due to the inherent parallel nature of most computations, and can be used to perform online anomaly detection. Extensive experimental results on simulated and real datasets illustrate that the framework can detect various types of anomalies along with the key parameters involved...|$|R

40|$|The X- 15 was a {{critical}} research vehicle {{in the early days}} of space flight. On November 15, 1967, the X- 15 - 3 suffered an in-flight breakup. This 191 st flight of the X- 15 and the 65 th flight of this third configuration was the only fatal accident of the X- 15 program. This paper presents an analysis, from a human factors perspective, of the events that led up to the accident. The analysis is based on the information contained in the report of the Air Force-NASA Accident Investigation Board (AIB) dated January, 1968. The AIBs analysis addressed, primarily, the events that occurred subsequent to the pilots taking direct control of the reaction control system. The analysis described here suggests that all of the events that caused the accident occurred well before the moment when the <b>pilot</b> <b>switched</b> to direct control. Consequently, the analyses and conclusions regarding the causal factors of, and the contributing factors to, the loss of Flight 3 - 65 presented here differ from those of the AIB based on the same evidence. Although the accident occurred in 1967, the results of the presented analysis are still relevant today. We present our analysis and discuss its implications for the safety of space operations...|$|R

40|$|In 2010 the National Research Council of Canada Flight Research Laboratory (NRC-FRL) {{completed}} {{prototype development}} and flight test qualification of a remote sensor helicopter platform for Defense Research and Development Canada (DRDC). Based on the NRC Fly-By-Wire (FBW) Bell 412 ASRA, the aircraft {{is capable of}} concurrent carriage of the Generation III JMMES (MX- 15 D electro-optic (EO) camera turret and computing payload) and 3 MDS (tow-body sensor and computing payload) sensors. Anticipated air-vehicle applications for these remote sensors include manned and unmanned, fixed and rotary-wing military assets. Sensor airworthiness qualification indicated no adverse flight or structural dynamics, stable tow-body flight dynamics, and no adverse aircraft EMI/EMC characteristics. Sensor functional testing revealed normal 3 MDS magnetic noise signatures and MX- 15 D EO operations. Man-machine interface and human factors engineering (<b>pilot</b> <b>switching,</b> egress) issues were highlighted for improvement. The current flight clearance allows an operational envelope for EO operations to the aircraft velocity-never-exceed (VNE) airspeed of 140 knots. 3 MDS tow-body operations are cleared to the aircraft 80 knot slung load airspeed limit. Clearance limitations include a three-member crew, day Visual Flight Rules (VFR) cueing, and FBW systems disabled operations. Over water operations as well as laser operations outside of Canada are currently prohibited. Future enhancements following correction of identified issues include flight envelope expansion as well as development of the capability to interface JMMES and 3 MDS with the aircraft FBW flight control system.

50|$|On November 28, 2013, {{at about}} 02:51 EST, Cessna N777BK was {{substantially}} damaged during a forced landing {{on a road}} near Montrose, Pennsylvania. The commercial pilot sustained minor injury and the airplane was substantially damaged. The airplane was registered to Flight Express, Inc., and operated by Airnet Systems, Inc., as flight USC146, under FAR 135. Marginal VFR conditions prevailed in the area. The flight was operating VFR flight following. The flight originated from Teterboro Airport around 01:36, and was destined for Buffalo Niagara International Airport. The pilot stated that the fuel tanks were filled before departure {{but he did not}} check the fuel tanks for contaminants after fueling. The flight departed with the fuel selector positioned to the right tank and climbed to 8,500 feet. About 15 minutes after established in cruise, the <b>pilot</b> <b>switched</b> to the left tank. About 15 to 20 minutes later he heard a sound and noticed the cylinder head temperature and exhaust gas temperatures had dropped to their lowest point on the scale and the fuel flow increased between 140 pounds-per-hour and the maximum the needle could go. He adjusted the mixture to no effect. The fuel selector was returned to the right tank, the mixture was enriched, and the fuel pump turned on to low, and then high, positions for about 5 seconds each. Unable to maintain altitude, he set a course for an airport 25 to 30 miles north of his position but realized he would be unable to land there. He maneuvered the airplane for a forced landing on a road but again realized that he would be unable to reach that road. He descended through clouds between 6,000 and 4,500 feet. After descending below the clouds, the aircraft was maneuvered for a landing on the road. The airplane collided with an unmarked power line that crossed the road diagonally. The airplane came to rest upright. According to contract maintenance personnel who recovered the airplane, while attempting to drain the left fuel tank from the sump drain, blockage of the opening by ice was noted.|$|R
