To escape them and save the life of his successor the Chola emperor sends his son along with the Chola people to a secret territory. The refugees take along an idol sacred to the Pandyas, angering them. To capture the escaped Cholas and the stolen idol, the Pandyas extend their invasion to unexplored territories but cannot find them.|$|E

50|$|Forests cover 31% {{of total}} land {{area of the}} planet. Of that, 12% are {{designated}} {{for the conservation of}} biological diversity and nearly all are inhabited. Many of the peoples, who live in and have customary rights to their forests, have developed ways of life and traditional knowledge that are attuned to their forest environments. Yet, forest policies commonly treat forests as empty lands controlled by the state and available for ‘development’ - colonisation, logging, plantations, dams, mines, oil wells, gas pipelines and agribusiness. These encroachments often force forest <b>peoples</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> forest homes. Many conservation schemes to establish wilderness reserves also deny forest peoples’ rights.|$|R

25|$|Besides higher {{employment}} and living standards, {{the first two}} years of economic revival seemed to offer a break in the cycle of rising rural violence. The flow of displaced peasants from the Sierra eased, and a good many peasants began to return to the countryside. That reverse might be explained by García's initial efforts to reduce reliance on military force to combat the guerrillas and thereby to lessen the degree of two-way violence driving <b>people</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> villages. But the trend may also have been a response to the reality of better economic conditions and earning possibilities in the agricultural sector.|$|E

[...] During the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals, Rangers coach Mike Keenan, who later coached Bure for one-and-a-half seasons in Vancouver, called him [...] "perhaps the most electrifying forward in the league".

500|$|In September 2005, Woodstock {{resident}} Scott Wayne Indiana tied {{his first}} plastic toy horse to a horse ring {{located in the}} Pearl District. Of his attempt {{to draw attention to}} the rings, and to celebrate Portland's history, Indiana said: [...] "I loved the rings, and felt that people just weren't noticing them. This was an attempt to shake <b>people</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> routines and get them to notice their surroundings." [...] Since then, the Horse Project has gained momentum and participation; horses can be found tied to rings throughout the city, especially in east Portland. The installations have sparked interaction with residents, who have left hay, lassoes, riders, saddles, water, wool blankets, and other [...] "treats" [...] for the horses. Horses are often defaced or go missing.|$|E
500|$|According to author Andy Gill, by {{starting}} {{his new album}} with what sounded like [...] "a demented marching-band... staffed by crazy <b>people</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> mind on loco-weed", Dylan delivered his biggest shock yet for his former folkie fans. The elaborate puns on getting stoned combine a sense of paranoiac persecution with [...] "nudge-nudge wink-wink bohemian hedonism". Heylin {{points out that the}} Old Testament connotations of getting stoned made the Salvation Army-style musical backing seem like a good joke. The enigmatic title came about, Heylin suggests, because Dylan knew a song entitled [...] "everybody must get stoned" [...] would be kept off the airwaves. Heylin links the title to the Book of Proverbs, chapter 27, verse 15: [...] "A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike." [...] Released as a single on March 22, 1966, [...] "Rainy Day Women" [...] reached number two on the Billboard singles chart, and number seven in the UK.|$|E
500|$|As Wellington's {{makeshift}} train slowly headed towards Manchester, it {{was accompanied}} {{along the route}} by cheering crowds, still unaware of the accident. As they passed the milepost marking [...] from Liverpool, {{in the middle of}} Chat Moss, they met Stephenson and Northumbrian on the southern track, returning from Manchester. Stephenson told the party of Huskisson's condition when he last saw him before leaving Eccles for Manchester (erroneously claiming that amputation had already been attempted successfully), and boasted of having set a new speed record. The three remaining carriages of Wellington's original train, still on the southern track, were detached from the train and attached to Northumbrian, which set off at full speed for Manchester. As the train approached Manchester the trackside bystanders became increasingly hostile, booing, hissing and waving banners against Wellington. Hostile crowds spilled onto the track, forcing the trains to slow to a crawl. Eventually the crowds on the track became so dense they were unable to disperse as the trains approached, and the trains were obliged [...] "to play the part of the juggernaut car", pushing <b>people</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> path with their own momentum.|$|E

2500|$|Co-written as {{a horror}} comedy by John Russo and George A. Romero {{under the title}} Monster Flick, an early {{screenplay}} draft concerned the exploits of adolescent aliens who visit Earth and befriend human teenagers. A second version of the script featured {{a young man who}} runs away from home and discovers rotting human corpses that aliens use for food scattered across a meadow. Russo came up with the concept that they would be the recently dead only, because they could not afford to bring long-dead <b>people</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> graves, or at least [...] "we" [...] thought. He also {{came up with the idea}} that they would be [...] "flesh-eaters." [...] Romero decided he liked those two ideas and without them, it would have been labeled a true 'rip-off' of [...] "Richard Matheson's I Am Legend" [...] novel (1954). [...] The final draft, written mainly by Russo during three days in 1967, focused on reanimated human corpses – Romero refers to them as ghouls – that consume the flesh of the living. In a 1997 interview with the BBC's Forbidden Weekend, Romero explained that the script developed into a three-part short story. Part one became Night of the Living Dead. Sequels Dawn of the Dead (1978) and Day of the Dead (1985) were adapted from the two remaining parts.|$|E

2500|$|During the earthquake, {{the freeway}} buckled and twisted to its limits before the support columns failed {{and sent the}} upper deck {{crashing}} to the lower deck. In an instant, 41 people were crushed to death in their cars. Cars on the upper deck were tossed around violently, some of them flipped sideways {{and some of them}} were left dangling {{at the edge of the}} highway. Nearby residents and factory workers came to the rescue, climbing onto the wreckage with ladders and forklifts and pulling trapped <b>people</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> mangled cars from under a four-foot gap in some sections. Sixty members of Oakland's Public Works Agency left the nearby city yard and joined rescue efforts. Employees from Pacific Pipe (a now-closed factory adjoining the freeway) drove heavy lift equipment to the scene and started using it to raise sections of fallen freeway enough to allow further rescue. Hard-hatted factory workers continued their volunteer operation nonstop until October 21, 1989, when they were forced to pause as U.S. President George H. W. Bush and California Governor George Deukmejian viewed the damage. The efforts of the rescue workers finally yielded results on October 21, just after dawn, when survivor Buck Helm was freed from the wreckage, having spent 90 hours trapped in his crushed car under the rubble. Dubbed [...] "Lucky Buck" [...] by the local radio, Helm lived for another 29 days on life support, but then died of respiratory failure at the age of 57.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2016, Apple {{significantly}} redesigned its Union Square Apple Store {{in downtown}} San Francisco, adding large glass doors for the entry, open spaces with touch-sensitive tables and shelves for product displays, and rebranded rooms for the store.

The [...] "Genius Bar" [...] becomes the [...] "Genius Grove", a tree-lined area for help and support. [...] "The Forum" [...] features a large video screen and offers game nights, sessions with experts in creative arts, and community events. [...] "The Boardroom" [...] lets aspiring developers and entrepreneurs learn how to use their products to their full potential. [...] "The Plaza", while limited to select locations, offers a [...] "park-like" [...] space outside the store featuring free 24/7 Wi-Fi access and will host live concerts on some weekends. Designed by Jony Ive and Angela Ahrendts, the idea was to make Apple Stores into [...] "town squares", in which people come naturally to the store as a gathering place, and to [...] "help foster human experiences that draw <b>people</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> digital bubbles". The new design will be adopted to every store Apple has, and while renovation is undergoing, stores are either relocated or temporarily closed. For some locations, including its flagship Fifth Avenue store in New York City, the redesign means substantial expansion of space, requiring dismantling, and possibly reworking, of its physical properties.|$|E
