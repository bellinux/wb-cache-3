Mrs. Crutchely, herself, though so much longer experienced, had {{scarcely}} looked after the captain's comfort with more judgment, and certainly not with greater solicitude, than this youthful bride had expended on her bridegroom's room. In that day, artists were not very numerous in America, nor is it very probable that Doctor Yardley would have permitted his daughter to take so decided a step as to sit for her miniature for Mark's possession; but {{she had managed to}} get her <b>profile</b> <b>cut,</b> and to have it framed, and the mate discovered it placed carefully among his effects, when only a week out. From this profile Mark derived the greatest consolation. It was a good one, and Bridget happened to have a face that would tell in that sort of thing, so that the husband had no difficulty in recognising the wife, in this little image. There it was, with the very pretty slight turn of the head to one side, that in Bridget was both natural and graceful. Mark spent hours in gazing at and in admiring this inanimate shadow of his bride, which never failed to recall to him all her grace, and nature, and tenderness and love, though it could not convey any direct expression of her animation and spirit.|$|E

It was a country doctor's office, with the usual country doctor's supply of drugs on a shelf, but very much more than the country doctor's usual library: the {{standard}} works were there, and there were also the principal periodicals and the latest treatises of note in the medical world. In a long, upright case, like that of an old hall-clock, was the anatomy of one who had long done with time; a laryngoscope and some other professional apparatus of constant utility lay upon the leaf of the doctor's desk. There was nothing in the room which did not suggest his profession, except the sword and the spurs which hung upon the wall opposite where Grace sat beside one of the front windows. She spent her time in study of the room and its appointments, and in now and then glancing out at Mr. Libby, who sat statuesquely patient in the buggy. His <b>profile</b> <b>cut</b> against the sky was blameless; and a humorous shrewdness which showed in the wrinkle at his eye and in the droop of his yellow mustache gave its regularity life and charm. It occurred to her that if Dr. Mulbridge caught sight of Mr. Libby before he saw her, or before she could explain that she had got one of the gentlemen at the hotel--she resolved upon this prevarication--to drive her to Corbitant in default of another conveyance, he would have his impressions and conjectures, which doubtless the bunch of lilies in her hand would do their part to stimulate. She submitted to this possibility, and waited for his coming, which began to seem unreasonably delayed. The door opened at last, and a tall, powerfully framed man of thirty-five or forty, dressed in an ill-fitting suit of gray Canada homespun appeared. He moved with a slow, pondering step, and carried his shaggy head bent downwards from shoulders slightly rounded. His dark beard was already grizzled, and she saw that his mustache was burnt and turned tawny at points by smoking, of which habit his presence gave stale evidence to another sense. He held Grace's card in his hand, and he looked at her, as he advanced, out of gray eyes that, if not sympathetic, were perfectly intelligent, and that at once sought to divine and class her. She perceived that he took in the lilies and her coming color; she felt that he noted her figure and her dress.|$|E

It is shown that the profile appearing on the cut surface changes rapidly over time, so the profile of the tool cutting edge should also be changing rapidly. Workpiece material adhered onto the cutting tool, which is also known as a built-up edge, is a phenomenon which could explain the observations made. In terms of tool damage modes, workpiece material adhesion is believed to have contributed to tool wear in examples provided from finish turning, thread turning and drilling.

40|$|The Jeffrey L. Brown Institute of Archaeology, University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, {{was engaged}} by RiverPort Inn and Marina, Inc., of Chattanooga, {{to conduct a}} Phase I level archaeological {{reconnaissance}} on portions of a nine-acre parcel on the Tennessee River occupied by the grain elevator and storage plant of Cargill, Inc. As required by the Tennessee Historical Commission, the reconnaissance specifically included deep subsurface testing of the tract. A 25 m (822 ̆ 7) grid was superimposed on the site and every accessible or otherwise undisturbed grid intersection was cored using a power soil auger. The fill was screened for uniform artifact retrieval, and observations were made concerning soil characteristics and approximate depths of soil layers. A total of 40 auger tests were completed to depths varying from 40 cm (1. 52 ̆ 7) to 1. 4 m (52 ̆ 7). The frequency distribution of artifacts, both prehistoric and historic, suggested several areas of activity on the site. Five backhoe trenches were excavated at various locations on the site to access deeplyburied cultural components and to examine site stratigraphy. None of the trenches intercepted well-developed prehistoric middens, but cultural remains were noted in deep stratigraphic contexts along the river. Surface collections and augering results confirmed {{the presence of a}} concentration of prehistoric artifacts along the crest of the riverbank {{in the vicinity of the}} conveyor belt to the barge loading facility. Surface collection of the artifacts indicated a site attributable to the Late Woodland or Hamilton Phase, a cultural period now designated the Woodland III period and dated approximately from A. D. 350 to A. D. 900. To assess whether these remains represented an intact, buried component or represented a disturbed, displaced archaeological site, a <b>profile</b> <b>cut</b> or small trench was excavated by hand near the surface artifact concentration. This <b>profile</b> <b>cut</b> revealed that a distinct and undisturbed prehistoric midden was present, and that substantial quantities of cultural material were in evidence. Portions of the soil strata were excavated by hand and the fill screened. The associated artifacts confirm that a small remnant of a Woodland III site is present, evidently the remains of a housesite situated on the crest of the river levee. The <b>profile</b> <b>cut</b> was not carried to sterile soil, and minor sherd frequencies of fabric-marked pottery also suggest possible occupation of the site in the Woodland II period dated 200 B. C. to A. D. 350. The presence of a multi-component archaeological site is possible. Human remains, specifically two phalanges or finger bones, were recovered from the Woodland III midden. The finds were identified by Craig Lahren, Assistant Medical Examiner, Hamilton County. It is not clear whether these disarticulated finds are associated with an interment otherwise preserved on the site. Limited documentary evidence suggested historic land uses in the project area were principally agricultural but included the landing of a ferry operated in the antebellum and postbellum periods, until the late 1880 s. Clusters of historic artifacts were noted along the creek margins of the property, but construction of the plant evidently destroyed any organized physical remains of historic structures on the site. Secondary testing is recommended to determine if the prehistoric components present along the riverbank are eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places. While the Phase I auger testing has indicated the approximate horizontal limits of the surviving Woodland III component on the site, further testing is required to determine the vertical limits of habitation along the riverbank. The secondary testing will also assist in determining if a prehistoric cemetery is present on site. [URL]...|$|E

40|$|The {{global market}} {{competition}} {{has put a}} pressure on the industry to reduce lead time and increase quality of parts. In particular, the area of gear cutting tool design requires capability to rapidly produce tool designs with increased tool geometry precision. The aim {{of this research is}} to explore the field of gear shaper cutter design and produce a model and software that would enable creation of more precise cutter designs, faster. A literature survey of involute cylindrical gearing geometry highlights deficiencies in addressing industry requirements of tool manufacturing, as most of the research in the area is focused on problems of gear design, but not tool design. This research, therefore, focuses on the process of gear manufacturing using the gear shaper cutters. It attempts to develop an analytical model and a set of tools that are able to aid the design process of gear shaper cutter. With cylindrical gear being essentially " at" and therefore easier to express an- alytically, the focus of recent papers has shifted to non-cylindrical and non-involute gear trains. Yet the geometry of the tools used to produce cylindrical gears remains largely untapped area, in particular the geometry of gear shaper cutters. The knowl- edge about the profile of the cutter teeth and the <b>profile</b> <b>cut</b> by the cutter in the gear blank are essential for high precision gear manufacturing. The gear shaper cutter is a metal cutting tool and therefore should be re-sharpened on a regular basis. These re-sharpening operations change the profile of the tool and, consequently, the profile of the gear it cuts. The changes in the cutter and gear geometry are analysed in this thesis and a way to calculate the life span of the tool is suggested. Gear shaper cutter profiles usually have one or more modifications to the theoret- ical ideal involute profile applied. Some of these modifications are used to produce a better cutter profile, while other should in turn produce modifications to the gear profile, and, finally, some are used to overcome generated gear profile constraints. Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software for gear shaper cutter design should be able to show the profile of the cutter and the <b>profile</b> <b>cut</b> by the cutter with arbitrary modifications applied. The analysis and visualisation of gear shaper cutters profiles cut by these cutters is impossible without a clear understanding of the principles of operation of gear generation hardware, generating motion and different machine geometry, all being covered in this thesis. In order to verify the analytical model and the CAD software case studies of the real-life gear shaper cutter designs were performed...|$|E
40|$|THE CAMBONGO-NEGUNZA RIVER AND ITS TRIBUTARIES: AN EXAMPLE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE DRAINAGE PATTERNS IN ANGOLA. The hydrographical {{basin of}} River Cambongo-Negunza, {{situated}} in the coastal area of central Angola, was selected {{as an example of}} the complexity of drainage patterns in Angola. From its sources in the massifs of the Marginal Mountain (more than 2 000 m) the river flows through the stepped planed erosion surfaces to the Ocean. In its lower course the river valley presents a narrow and V-shaped cross <b>profile</b> <b>cut</b> in sedimentary rocks (Cretaceous-Quaternary). The coastal erosion surface, including the raised beaches (mean altitudes from 40 to 100 m), levelling the rocks of the Sedimentary Belt and those of the ancient crystalline massif, gradually rises towards the east until a well marked topographical limit, the base (altitude approx. 280 - 300 m) of the steep western slopes of a NNE-SSW quartzitic ridge with a dissymmetrical cross-sectional profile: the serra do Engelo (altitudes between 1 400 - 1 700 m), whose faults are peppered with thermal springs. Above the coastal surface, in the crystalline rock strip, some quartzitic hills with Inselberge characteristics rise out of the plains, leading to problems in relation to, for example, the western extension of the quartzite formations and their dismantling, and the behaviour of the same material in the complex genesis and evolution processes of the extensive regional line of N-S escarpments, against which the erosion surfaces of the coastal belt end. In the limestones near the coast, the river Cambongo-Negunza has a subterranean network of large caves and galleries surfacing near the small plain from which it flows into the ocean. Not far from the valley sinks and dolines of various sizes and lapies can be seen. The climatic conditions are semi-arid, with annual precipitation less than 700 mm and high evaporation rates. Vegetation is a mix of that which can be found in savanna, steppe and xerophytic habitats, with few to no trees. A vast area of outcrops of granitic and related rocks, sometimes covered by regoliths of various thicknesses, can be found between the Serra do Engelo and the massifs of the Marginal Mountain chain. The altitudes of the general levelling range between 1 100 and 1 200 m. The area is covered by forest and savannas with low trees, shrubs and tall grasses growing in rather thin and variable soils, fersialitic being among the most frequent. The average temperature is around 22 ºC and annual rainfall is about 1 400 mm. Lateritisation or bauxitisation lines and subaerean duricrust can be seen in many places. Above this surface, there are many Inselberge-type hills, isolated or in groups, mostly with square-shaped forms, linked or not to the geometrical patterns of the hydrographic networks, revealing the structural control of fractures and faults over these watercourses, whether small or large, permanent or temporary. Note that the majority of the Inselberge is not found near the escarpments of the marginal mountain chain, the eastern limit of the 1 100 - 1 200 metre-high plain, but rather quite a distance away to the west, near the Serra do Engelo quartzitic ridge. The same can be seen in the neighbouring basins of the River Cuvo-Queve to the north and to the south of the Cambongo-Negunza river basin. Fracture valleys and residual hills call for more detailed explanations, with suggestions of criteria for their study. Moreover, there has been the concern regarding how to correlate several factors relative to external dynamics (meteorisation and erosion in a broad sense) with those relative to internal dynamics (geology and tectonics) to explain the genesis and evolution of the landforms. Therefore, the study wraps up with some brief thoughts regarding a dynamic geo-chronological approach...|$|E

The PFPs were visualized using dye tracer experiments. Stained and unstained soil was sampled from three <b>profile</b> <b>cuts</b> per plot and analyzed for P fractions. The results show that labile P concentrations were highest in the O-layer and had the same range of values at all sites (240 – 320 mg·kg− 1), although total P (TP) differed considerably (530 – 2330 mg·kg− 1). The ratio of labile P to TP was significantly lower in the P-rich soil compared to the medium and P-poor soils. By contrast, the ratio of moderately labile P to TP was highest at the P-rich site. The shifts in P fractions with soil depth were generally gradual in the P-rich soil, but more abrupt at the others. The contents of labile and moderately labile P clearly differed in PFPs compared to soil matrix, but not statistically significant.
