50|$|Watson {{was born}} in Dundee, Scotland on 7 March 1860. He {{specialised}} in sanitation and {{was regarded as a}} pioneer in the development of sewage treatment. Watson was engineer to the Birmingham and District Drainage Board and also General Manager to the Birmingham, Tame and Rea District Drainage Board. At Birmingham he was responsible for the construction of the first large-scale <b>percolating</b> <b>filter</b> plant, a complete departure from the traditional land treatment in use in the city and elsewhere. Other changes that he introduced, based on his work in Birmingham, were the separation of sludge digestion, the extraction of methane from sewage for use in power generation and the introduction of flocculation prior to the <b>percolating</b> <b>filter.</b> He drew up plans for sanitation works in the district of Aberdeen which included a pumping station at Denmill, reservoir at the Hill of Ord and water supply to the district of Culter. These plans are now held by the National Archives of Scotland.|$|E
40|$|Endocrine disrupting {{chemicals}} (EDCs) {{can alter}} endocrine function in exposed animals. Such critical effects, {{combined with the}} ubiquity of EDCs in sewage effluent and potentially in tapwater, have led to concerns {{that they could be}} major physiological disruptors for wildlife and more controversially for humans. Although sewage effluent is known to be a rich source of EDCs, there is as yet no evidence for EDC uptake by invertebrates that live within the sewage treatment system. Here, we describe the use of an extraction method and GC–MS {{for the first time to}} determine levels of EDCs (e. g., dibutylphthalate, dioctylphthalate, bisphenol-A and 17 β-estradiol) in tissue samples from earthworms (Eisenia fetida) living in sewage <b>percolating</b> <b>filter</b> beds and garden soil. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such use of these techniques to determine EDCs in tissue samples in any organism. We found significantly higher concentrations of these chemicals in the animals from sewage <b>percolating</b> <b>filter</b> beds. Our data suggest that earthworms can be used as bioindicators for EDCs in these substrates and that the animals accumulate these compounds to levels well above those reported for waste water. The potential transfer into the terrestrial food chain and effects on wildlife are discussed. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Endocrine disrupting {{chemicals}} (EDCs) {{constitute a}} diverse group of chemical compounds which can alter endocrine function in exposed animals. Whilst most studies have focussed on exposure of wildlife to EDCs via aquatic routes, there is the potential for transfer into the terrestrial food chain through consumption of contaminated prey items developing in sewage sludge and waste water at sewage treatment works. In this study, we determine levels of EDCs in aerial insects whose larval stages develop on <b>percolating</b> <b>filter</b> beds at sewage treatment works. We compare absolute concentrations of known EDCs with those collected from aquatic environments not exposed to sewage effluent outflow. Our findings document {{for the first time that}} aerial invertebrates developing on sewage filter beds take up a range of chemicals thought to be incorporated from the sewage effluent, which act as endocrine disruptors. For two synthetic chemicals (17 a-ethinylestradiol and butylated hydroxy aniline), concentrations were significantly higher in insects captured around <b>percolating</b> <b>filter</b> beds than sites over 2 km from the nearest sewage works. A number of species of insectivorous bats and birds, some of which are declining or threatened, use sewage works as principle foraging sites. We calculate approximate exposure levels for a species of bat known to forage within sewage works and suggest that further research is warranted to assess the ecological implications of consuming contaminated invertebrate prey...|$|E

Similarly, the predator was present in the aerobic surface layers of river sediments but not in the anaerobic bottom layers.

30|$|In {{order to}} assuage {{the scourge of}} water {{pollution}} challenges emanating from improper handling of domestic wastewater, the under-resourced {{regions of the world}} require the use of high-performance, economical, technologically simple, reliable, and low-energy consuming appropriate technology for the management of domestic wastewater. Gravity percolation of wastewater through reactive material is one such on-site system that has been tested and found to be an effective appropriate technology for the under-resourced regions. On the strength of the high-performance efficiencies of the gravity <b>percolating</b> <b>filter</b> in the attenuation of array of pollutants (physicochemical parameters, nutrients, and micro pollutants) found in domestic wastewater, at the laboratory and field study, the on-site treatment scheme is an appropriate technology for domestic wastewater treatment.

40|$|Sewage {{treatment}} {{works with}} <b>percolating</b> <b>filter</b> beds {{are known to}} provide profitable foraging areas for insectivorous birds due to their association with high macroinvertebrate densities. Fly larvae developing on filter beds at sewage treatment works may similarly provide a valuable resource for foraging bats. Over the last two decades, however, {{there has been a}} decline in filter beds towards a system of “activated sludge”. Insects and bat activity were surveyed at 30 sites in Scotland employing these two different types of sewage treatment in order to assess the possible implications of these changes for foraging bats. Bat activity (number of passes) recorded from broad-band bat detectors was quantified at three points within each site. The biomass of aerial insects, sampled over the same period as the detector surveys, was measured using a suction trap. The biomass of insects and activity of Pipistrellus spp. was significantly higher at filter beds than at activated sludge sites. In addition, whilst foraging activity of Pipistrellus spp. at filter beds was comparable to that of adjacent “good” foraging habitat, foraging at activated sludge sites was considerably lower. This study indicates the high potential value of an anthropogenic process to foraging bats, particularly in a landscape where their insect prey has undergone a marked decline, and suggests that the current preference for activated sludge systems is likely to reduce the value of treatment works as foraging sites for bats...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: Various {{aspects of}} the {{nutrition}} of four fungi which commonly inhabit <b>percolating</b> <b>filters</b> treating sewage have been studied. Sepedunium n. sp., a pre-dominating fungus, required organic sources of nitrogen while Fusarium aqueducturn, Geotrichum sp., and Trichosporon cutaneum were able to utilize ammonium salts; F. aqueductum was also able to utilize nitrate. Geotrichum sp. and F. aqueductum needed no external supply of vitamins, T. cutaneum required thiamine and Sepe-donium sp. required thiamine and biotin for optimum growth. The pH range for optimum growth was narrow (pH 7 to 8. 5) for Sepedonium sp. while the ranges for the other fungi were much wider (pH 3 or 4 to 9). Zn, Ca, Mn and probably Fe and Cu were required by Sepedanium sp., which {{was the only one}} of the four fungi inhibited by concentrations of Zn above the optimum in media partially deficient in other elements. Mn, Fe or Cu when added with Zn counteracted the inhibitory action, while Ca increased it.

40|$|The {{suitability}} {{of a new}} plastic supporting medium for biofiltration was tested over a three year period. Tests were carried out on the stability, surface properties, mechanical strength, and dimensions of the medium. There was no {{evidence to suggest that}} the medium was deficient in any of these respects. The specific surface (320 m 2 m- 3) and the voidage (94 %) of the new medium are unlike any other used in bio-filtration and a pilot plant containing two filters was built to observe its effects on ecology and performance. Performance was estimated by chemical analysis and ecology studied by film examination and fauna counts. A system of removable sampling baskets was designed to enable samples to be obtained from two intermediate depths of filter. One of the major operating problems of <b>percolating</b> <b>filters</b> is excessive accumulation of film. The amount of film is influenced by hydraulic and organic load and each filter was run at a different loading. One was operated at 1. 2 m 3 m- 3 day- 1 (DOD load 0. 24 kgm- 3 day- 1) judged at the time to be the lowest filtration rate to offer advantages over conventional media. The other filter was operated at more than twice this loading (2. 4 m 3 m- 3 day-lBOD load 0. 55 kgm- 3 day- 1) giving a roughly 2. 5 x and 6 x the conventional loadings recommended for a Royal Commission effluent. The amount of film in each filter was normally low (0. 05 - 3 kgm(3 as volatile solids) and did not affect efficiency. The evidence collected during the study indicated that the ecology of the filters was normal when compared with the data obtained from the literature relating to filters with mineral media. There were indications that full ecological stability was yet to be reached and this was affecting the efficiency of the filters. The lower rate filter produced an average 87 % BOD removal giving a consistent Royal Commission effluent during the summer months. The higher rate filter produced a mean 83 % BOD removal but at no stage a consistent Royal Commission effluent. From the data on ecology and performance the filters resembled conventional filters rather than high rate filters...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Reactors with fixed {{biocenosis}} {{are most}} commonly applied for fish farm recirculating water treatment, {{as they have}} a number of advantages over other biological purification plants. In actual practice, inefficient plants which generally operate in a single-stage mode are often used. Finer treatment of fish farm recirculating water with removal of organic and nitrogen-containing contaminants can be achieved by a multi-stage biological process. Comparative studies of multi-stage treatment of fish farm recirculating water by reactors with fixed biocenosis were conducted in order to choose the optimal process flow scheme. The study results determine optimal process flow schemes for fish farm recirculating water treatment in such bioreactors as well as parameters for their operation in the course of bio-oxydation of organic contaminants and ammonium salts and denitrification. The best results were achieved when applying three-stage biological treatment of fish farm recirculating water where the oxidizer is configured as a <b>percolating</b> <b>filter</b> and the nitrification filter and the denitrification filter are accomplished in the form of flooded bioreactors. Besides, the oxidizer and the nitrification filter are placed successively in the main water flux to be treated whereas the denitrification filter is installed in a separate zone. The obtained results allow to define reactor volumes for carrying out of nitrification and denitrification in the course of fish farm recirculating water treatment.

40|$|A {{physical}} model and a {{computational fluid dynamic}} (cfd) model (HYDRO- 3 D) {{have been developed to}} simulate the effects of novel maturation pond configurations, inlet and outlet positions, channels and critical environmental factors (wind speed and direction) on the hydraulic efficiency of maturation ponds at a small sewage treatment works in southern England. The ponds form the final, polishing stage of an otherwise conventional <b>percolating</b> <b>filter</b> treatment works. The final effluent of the plant joins a stream that discharges directly to a bathing beach. Thus the overall objective of the project is to maximise the efficiency of pathogen indicator removal and meet European bathing water standards. The specific aim of the study reported here was to calibrate the {{physical model}} and to assess its reliability as a tool for assessing and predicting hydraulic performance of ponds. Work focused on the comparison of simulation outputs from the cfd model and full scale system performance in order to increase the reliability of both models as design tools. The full scale ponds under study comprised three parallel, tertiary stage maturation ponds. A Geopacks flow meter was used to calibrate the ratio of water and wind velocities in the full scale pond channels and the model. Additionally floats and novel drogues were used to measure low flow velocities within the physical model. Initial tracer experiments using salt and rhodamine-WT were conducted to define the hydraulic retention time (HRT) of the physical model in still air and with top and bottom inlets and outlets. In the physical model the effect of back-mixing and dead zones can be readily observed and photographed, whereas this is more difficult to display in the outputs of computational models. Potential sources of disagreement are discussed in the thesis, but their concurrence suggests they both have a valuable role to play in the future design of ponds aimed at maximising hydraulic efficiency. The study also confirmed field observations which indicated that wind tends to be damaging rather than beneficial to pond performance. (Abstract shortened by ProQuest.) ...|$|E
40|$|Sewage {{treatment}} plant (STP) effluents with primarily domestic inputs are strongly suspected {{to be an}} important source of natural and synthetic estrogens contaminating the aquatic environment. Even a few ng/L of some of these substances can provoke reproductive disturbances in riverine fish. The main purpose of this investigation has been that of ascertaining whether activated sludge STPs (ASSTPs) are able to produce significant amounts of free estrogens. For this purpose, we have monitored monthly estriol (E- 3), estradiol (E- 2), estrone (E- 1) and ethinylestradiol (EE 2) in influents and effluents of six Roman ASSTPs for five months. To do this, we have developed an original analytical method involving analyte extraction with a Carbograph 4 cartridge and LC coupled with negative turbo ion spray tandem mass spectrometry in the selected reaction monitoring mode. Analyte recovery ranged between 86 and 91 %, and limits of quantification were below 1 ng/ L. Over five months, inlet concentrations of E- 3, E- 2, E- 1 and EE 2 at the six plants averaged respectively 80, 12, 52 and 3. 0 ng/L. On the basis of the daily human excretion of conjugated estrogens, the above values suggest that deconjugation oc curs preferentially in sewers. The activated sludge treatment efficiently removed E- 3 (95 %), E- 2 (87 %), EE 2 (85 %), but not E- 1 (61 %). In four events out of thirty, E- 1 outlet levels were even larger than inlet levels. Median concentrations of the two most potent estrogens, that is E- 2 and EE 2 leaving the six ASSTPs were respectively 1 and 0. 45 ng/L. Ana lysis of a river (Tiber) water sampled downstream of small towns whose sewages are treated by <b>percolating</b> <b>filter</b> STPs or directly discharged into the river revealed the presence of all four estrogens at levels between 0. 04 (EE 2) and 1. 5 ng/L (E- 1) ...|$|E
40|$|L'influence du facteur {{thermique}} sur la contamination de la carpe par le 60 Co a été étudiée pour 4 températures : 8 °C, 15 °C, 20 °C et 25 °C. Pour chaque expérience, un lot homogène de 10 individus, d'une masse initiale d'environ 2, 3 g et nourris ad libitum, est introduit dans 5 litres d'eau, renouvelée tous les 3 à 4 jours et contaminée à raison de 1, 2. 105 Bq. l- 1. Entre deux renouvellements, la concentration du 60 Co dans l'eau décroît sensiblement et l'état ionique du radionucléide, introduit à 100 % sous forme cationique, évolue vers des formes anioniques et neutres. Ces deux faits sont liés au métabolisme des poissons dont {{la croissance}} pondérale est corrélée à la température, la distribution de la nourriture étant adaptée aux besoins des individus. Globalement, la quantité totale de radiocobalt fixée par les carpes apparaît très fortement liée au facteur thermique mais, selon le niveau des températures, des situations différentes se dégagent pour des mêmes écarts. Il n'y a pas proportionnalité comptéte entre élévation de température et accumulation du 60 Co mais une augmentation discontinue témoignant de l'existence de paliers, dont le plus important se situe à 20 °C. Le facteur de concentration du 60 Co est, par contre, peu influencé par le facteur thermique pour les écarts inférieurs à 10 °C ou quand la température maximale est inférieure à 20 °C. L'incidence de la température devient sensible quand les écarts dépassent 10 °C et notamment lorsque sont atteintes des valeurs correspondant à l'optimum thermique des carpes. A l'équilibre, le facteur de concentration moyen du 60 Co est de 3, 6 à 8 °C, 4, 4 à 15 °C, 5, 1 à 20 °C et 6 à 25 °C. The problems of simultaneous thermal and radionuclide pollutions {{have led to}} a number of laboratory and field studies of the temperature effects on the radioactive contamination of aquatic organisms. AMIARD and KHALANSKI (1981) concluded from their bibliographic study that a temperature rise generally has a positive effect on biological accumulation of radionuclides in freshwater organisms. Due to insufficient data, however, this conclusion {{does not appear to be}} substantiated for 60 Co uptake by fish. An experimental study was therefore undertaken to assess the effect of temperature on 60 Co uptake by Caprinus carpio. The importance of 60 Co results from the fact that, apart from tritium, radioactive cobalt isotopes represent the major components of liquid wastes discharged from pressurized water reactors, which are widely operated in France (BARDIN et al., 1982; PICAT et al., 1986). The common carp (Caprinus carpio L.) was selected as the subject of this experimentation because of its wide geographic distribution and the frequency with which it is found in field samples, making it a suitable biological indicator (D'AUBENTON and SPILLMANN, 1978; FOULQUIER and PALLY, 1982; FOULQUIER et al., 1985). The effect of temperature on 60 Co contamination of the carp was investigated by conducting the same experiment at four temperatures (8 °C, 15 °C, 20 °C and 25 °C) determined by ecological and physiological criteria. In each experiment, young carps with a mean weight of 2. 3 g were placed in a tank containing 5 liters of water contaminated with 1. 2 x 105 Bq. l- 1 of 60 Co. The water was renewed at intervals of 3 - 4 days. Modifications in the ionic form of the radio-active cobalt dissolved in the water were monitored by <b>percolating</b> <b>filtered</b> water samples through ion exchange resin columns. The carps were fed to satiation with an industrial food containing 12 % minerals, 8 % fats and 58 % proteins (dry weight) together with vitamins and trace elements including 0. 2 mg. kg- 1 of cobalt. Radioactivity levels in the fish were measured, after mild anesthesia, with a single-channel amplitude selector equipped with a thallium-activated flat sodium iodine probe. Between successive water renewals, the 60 Co concentration diminished (Table 1) and the ionic form of the radionuclide remaining in solution was significantly modified. The 60 Co was introduced in chloride form and was initially found exclusively as a cation; anionic or neutral forms appeared and became dominant after a few days (Figure 1). These two phenomena are probably related to the fish metabolism which is temperature dependent. Thus, food was distributed according to the individual requirements, and an exponential correlation was observed between the temperature and the weight gain in the carps (Table 1). The appearance of anionic and neutral forms may be attributed to excessive amounts of organic matter due to the presence of the fish and food (FUKAI and MURRAY, 1973; KILLEY et al., 1984). This evolution also results from a significant increase in ions such as HCO 3 -, Cl-, SO 4 [...] , PO 4 [...] and NH 4 + (FRITSCH and BAUDIN, 1984) which may combine with Co++ ions to form neutral molecules and anionic complexes (TRISHAN et al., 1981). Radioactive decay in the mater is also temperature-dependent : the amount of fecal matter, which strongly adsorbs radioactive cobalt, is proportional to the metabolic intensity in the fish. The overall 60 Co uptake by the carps (Table 2) appears to be strongly related to the temperature, but the effect of a given temperature rise varied with the initial temperature (Table 4). The 60 Co uptake was not fully proportional to the temperature rise, but was observed to increase in stepwise fashion indicating the existence of various thresholds. The most significant of these was noted at 20 °C, which is the lower limit of the optimum temperature range for carps. The 60 Co concentration in th fish (Table 3) was influenced to a much lower extent by the temperature than the total uptake. Small temperature variations (5 - 7 °C) had little or no effect on the concentration factor; this was also true for larger variations, from 8 °C to 20 °C (Table 4). Temperature effects were only significant between 8 °C and 25 °C, and between 15 °C and 25 °C. The 60 Co concentration variation in time was similar for all four temperatures, with two successive phases (Figure 2). It can be expressed mathematically by an exponential model based on the existence of several compartments in living organisms characterized by the influx and efflux rates for the element under consideration (GOLSTEIN and ELWOOD, 1971; AOYAMA and INOUE, 1973; PENTREATH, 1975; GONTIER, 1983). The maximum value and the time required to reach equilibrium were determined by extrapolation from the equations for the concentration factor variations. The results were 3. 6 and 510 days at 8 °C, 4. 4 and 220 days at 15 °C, 5. 1 and 125 days at 20 °C, and 6 and 110 days at 25 °C. These values indicate that a temperature rise diminishes the time required to reach equilibrium and slightly increases the concentration factor by an amount that is statistically significant only for major temperature differences (Table 4). Detailed investigations of various freshwater species, notably Caprinus carpio, have demonstrated the decisive effect of temperature on metabolic activity in these animals (LEVESQUE, 1980). The results presented here indicate that the 60 Co uptake rate in the carp is not proportional to the temperature rise as is generally the case for physiological processes. From a radiation protection standpoint, this observation suggests that the temperature is not an essential factor in 60 Co contamination of freshwater fish...|$|R
40|$|Vertical flow filters (unplanted) and {{vertical}} flow constructed wetlands (planted), simple and inexpensive technologies to treat effectively {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) contaminated water, consist of containers filled with granular material which is intermittently fed with contaminated water. Contaminants are removed from the water <b>percolating</b> through the <b>filter</b> due {{to a combination of}} biodegradation, volatilization and root uptake as the main removal processes. While biodegradation is the desired process, volatile emission might restrict the application of such systems. The focus of this thesis is on the assessment and quantification of individual removal processes in pilot-scale outdoor vertical filters and wetlands, located in Leuna, Germany used for VOCs contaminated groundwater treatment. Numerical reactive transport simulations were performed to extrapolate findings from a pilot-scale intermittently loaded system used for domestic waste water treatment to predict the performance of such a system for treatment of water containing ammonium and two VOCs: benzene and methyl tertiary butyl ether – MTBE. Model simulations considered aerobic degradation and volatilization assuming different scenarios. Model results predicted depth and frequency of the intermittent water loading, as well as the degradation kinetics and material properties are relevant for the contribution of the individual processes to total VOCs removal. An appropriate combination of injection depth and composition of the filter material would result in increasing biodegradation enhanced by oxygen recharge, at a limited emission of volatiles. For a selected pilot-scale vertical flow filter in Leuna, benzene and MTBE volatilization and biodegradation were investigated by a combination of field measurements and conservative numerical model simulations. Non-reactive tracer tests and flow rate measurements showed highly transient flow and heterogeneous transport regime in this filter system. Radon- 222 (naturally occurring in the treated water and measured at the in- and out-flow of the filter) behavior reproduced by numerical simulations and extrapolated for benzene and MTBE, indicated high volatilization potential. In contrast, relatively low volatile concentrations were detected by passive samplers on top of the filter. Qualitative assessment of biodegradation by catabolic genes analysis at different depths of the filter; and semi-quantitative assessment by stable isotope fractionation analysis indicated high potential for aerobic degradation. Thus, despite the high volatilization potential, biodegradation is dominating the contaminant mass removal: VOCs entering the soil air are subject to subsequent biodegradation in the upper filter layer acting, which is acting as a biofilter and reducing atmospheric VOCs emissions. Removal processes in a pilot-scale vertical flow filter and a vertical flow constructed wetland showing high VOCs removal, were analyzed by numerical reactive transport model simulations. Model calibration was based on porous material analyses, flow rate measurements, conservative solute and gas tracer tests, and in- and out-flow contaminant concentrations measurement. Numerical modeling results suggested very high biodegradation rates at both filters avoided volatile atmospheric emissions attributing the observed removal to biodegradation only. The simulation study thus supports the use of both of these vertical flow systems for the treatment of contaminated groundwater and the use of reactive transport modeling for the assessment of volatile organic compound removal in these high performance treatment systems...|$|R

In the {{experiments}} iron hydroxide {{was removed from}} sand by HCl by, subsequently the sand was boiled off with water and under water filled into 2 cm wide glass tubes. The tubes were sealed by an bored-through stopper provided at the lower, rear end a thin wire gauze and eventually a thin cotton wool plug, and the outflow tube pushed into the same leads into a container with water under constant pressure; the other tube end was provided with an inlet tube, which was also connected also to a water container under constant pressure. During off-time of {{the experiments}} the tubes were sealed air-proof. Both the tubes and the container intended for the in-take of the water flowed through were placed beside each other and were subjected thus in same way to the by the way almost constant temperature. An indispensable condition {{for the success of}} the experiments is the uniform grain size of the sand, which by the way may be put into the tubes only by small amounts. The substantial results of these investigations touching different hydrologic and soil science controversial issues are the subsequent: 1. The velocity of water circulating in horizontal direction in a sand does is not in reverse relation to the thickness of the filter and in straight relation to the applied pressure. In thick filter columns the pressure effect decreases more and more, and the movement of the water is only based on the imbibition. The effect even of a very strong pressure stops after short extending, and the water flows, as if no pressure was applied, therefore a pressure locally applied on a sand layer does not propagate on a considerable distance. 2. With the filtration in vertical direction according results are obtained only for same particle size of the sand; since this condition in nature is hardly fulfilled, no generally valid mathematical formula can be set up for this circulation. Under influence of the water movement in vertical direction the fine parts of the sand move upward, so that the water passage is hindered here and a to a certain extent an automatic rational filter is formed. 3. The resistance of the filter exerted on the passed water decreases apparently proportional to the filter thickness, the POISEUILLE law is only valid for thin filters. 4. If the water <b>percolating</b> the sand <b>filter</b> contains air, so it sticks at the sand grains on certain positions and hinders to a high degree the descending of the water. 5. The runoff from a vertically placed filter decreases only proportional to the thickness at the point, when the pressure reached a certain intensity. If this pressure is only weak, then the filtrate quantity increases with the filter thickness, because then the weight of the water column makes an effect. From this the conclusion is to be drawn that the seepage water quantities supplied to a groundwater stream are not pressed down by any means by the thickness of the layer to be percolated. 6. The volume of the water moistening the sand predominates the volume of the voids of the sand grains in apparent contact the more, the finer the sand is. The free space between the sand grains influnces therefore enormously the mobility of the sand impregnated with water (swimming sand). 7. Temperature increase accelerates the action of a filter due to the reduction of the inner friction of the filter fluid, however for a doubling of the filtrate quantity a rise in temperature to almost 30 ° is required. 8. The loess loam from the Hesbaye is still permeable for water at a thickness of 8 m (and probably still further). The same applies to clay, as long as he does not stand under pressure, thus it can be unhinderedly expanding correspondingly to the infiltration. 10. From all that it follows that the down flow of the meteoric water cannot take place regularly through the soil in parallel layers. Flowing on into the depth takes place only in limited space, because of the soil air which has to be displaced, since channels must remain for escaping air. Here the water penetrates only if the surface is sprinkled or covered by a rather high water layer or by melting snow, respectively. If the water begins to penetrate, then its velocity increases with the height of the water column. Subsequently on the superficial layers a suction effect is then carried out, which stops only then if the flow downward is in equilibrium with the capillary impregnation, and so the movement is downward annihilated.
