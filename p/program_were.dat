5|$|In 1912 the Davis Library {{was added}} to the campus with space for 5,000 volumes. Although a major improvement, its {{atmosphere}} was inhospitable by the standards of later generations. Stacks were locked to students, for example, and the librarian's office was located {{at the entrance to the}} stacks to maximize control over entry. Decisions about book selections and the library's <b>program</b> <b>were</b> in the hands of an all-male faculty committee instead of the female librarian.|$|E
5|$|Potential {{students}} {{were expected to}} have undergone grammar, rhetoric and encyclopedic sciences studies. Another prerequisite was the mastery of Greek and Latin, given that the classical juridic references and imperial constitutions used in the teaching <b>program</b> <b>were</b> written in Latin. The aspirants could pursue their preparatory studies in public schools or have private tutors.|$|E
5|$|The {{beginning}} of 1970 saw {{the initiation of}} the 18th Engineers Brigade's Operation Last Chance, a program of command emphasis and organization for motivation and success of that year's engineer operations.

5|$|A {{historical}} plaque {{awarded to}} Avery {{indicates that it}} is the oldest house in Ledyard and states its date from 1720, but evidence suggests it to be older. This plaque was part of a statewide funded campaign by the State of Connecticut for the 350th anniversary of the state's founding. Disagreements over the <b>program</b> <b>were</b> widespread due to the difficulty in dating the homes by craftsmanship and the lack of documentation to prove it. Ledyard recognized the Avery Homestead because of the documentation possessed by Amos G. Avery.|$|E
5|$|Agnes Fay Morgan (May 4, 1884 – July 20, 1968) was an American chemist and academic. She was the {{longtime}} {{chair of the}} home economics program at the University of California. Her program was strongly grounded in science, and students admitted into the <b>program</b> <b>were</b> required to have a level of science education that was not typical of home economics programs at the time. Morgan {{was one of the}} earliest married female college professors in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Although many in NASA's Voyager <b>program</b> <b>were</b> {{supportive}} of the idea, there were concerns that taking a picture of Earth {{so close to the}} Sun risked damaging the spacecraft's imaging system irreparably. It was not until 1989 that Sagan's idea was put into practice, but then instrument calibrations delayed the operation further, and the personnel who devised and transmitted the radio commands to Voyager 1 were also being laid off or transferred to other projects. Finally, NASA Administrator Richard Truly interceded to ensure that the photograph was taken.|$|E

5|$|Another {{issue of}} {{controversy}} was {{the scale of}} its actual scientific return, particularly following {{the loss of the}} Spektr science module. Astronauts, managers and various members of the press all complained that the benefits of the <b>program</b> <b>were</b> outweighed by the risks associated with it, especially considering {{the fact that most of}} the US science experiments had been contained within the holed module. As such, a large amount of American research was inaccessible, reducing the science that could be performed. The safety issues caused NASA to reconsider the future of the program at various times. The agency eventually decided to continue and came under fire from various areas of the press regarding that decision.|$|E
5|$|Both the {{character}} and the <b>program</b> <b>were</b> announced to the public via an advertisement in March 2000, though the program was not ready for use at that time.

The program was never officially released nor cancelled, though the trademarks for both Myosphere and Mya were abandoned by Motorola in 2002. The name Mya was believed to be a play on the words 'My assistant'.|$|E

5|$|The British {{governments of}} 1954–58 (under Conservatives Winston Churchill, Anthony Eden, and Harold Macmillan) also quietly {{resisted}} a test ban, despite the British public favoring a deal, until the US Congress approved expanded nuclear collaboration in 1958 and until after Britain had tested its first hydrogen bombs. In their view, testing was necessary if the UK nuclear <b>program</b> <b>were</b> {{to continue to}} develop. This opposition was tempered by concern that resistance to a test ban might lead the US and Soviet Union to pursue an agreement without Britain having any say in the matter.|$|E
5|$|The Cold War-inspired Space Race {{between the}} Soviet Union and the U.S. {{led to an}} {{acceleration}} of interest in exploration of the Moon. Once launchers had the necessary capabilities, these nations sent unstaffed probes on both flyby and impact/lander missions. Spacecraft from the Soviet Union's Luna <b>program</b> <b>were</b> the first to accomplish a number of goals: following three unnamed, failed missions in 1958, the first human-made object to escape Earth's gravity and pass near the Moon was Luna 1; the first human-made object to impact the lunar surface was Luna 2, and the first photographs of the normally occluded {{far side of the}} Moon were made by Luna 3, all in 1959.|$|E
5|$|The MOL {{program was}} {{cancelled}} on 10 June 1969, {{in favour of}} unmanned reconnaissance satellites. Some systems developed for the <b>program</b> <b>were</b> later used on unmanned missions, while the space suits which were under development were transferred to NASA. The Titan IIIM rocket which was to launch MOL never flew, however some of the upgrades that were built into it were later used to upgrade other Titan rockets — the stretched first and second stages became the Titan 34, which {{was used as the}} core of some later Titan IIIB flights, and on the Titan 34D. The seven-segment solid rocket boosters were later introduced on the Titan IVA.|$|E

This is a technique where the satellite takes advantage of the gravity and velocity of planets to reach its destination.|$|E
5|$|The {{projects}} ran out {{of funding}} due to the 1975–1976 New York City fiscal crisis, along {{with the fact that}} the MTA did not have a consistent funding source (its five-year Capital Programs were implemented in 1982 due to further decline in the subway after 1975–1976). Expected to be completed by the mid-1970s and early 1980s, lines for the Program for Action had to be reduced or canceled altogether due to the crisis. Because of the fiscal crisis, the Archer Avenue and 63rd Street lines, the only two complete lines to be built under the <b>program,</b> <b>were</b> truncated and delayed, and there were plans to abandon the expansions altogether.|$|E

5|$|In the General Government, the {{remaining}} schools were subjugated to the German educational system, {{and the number}} and competence of their Polish staff was steadily scaled down. All universities and most secondary schools were closed, if not immediately after the invasion, then by mid-1940. By late 1940, no official Polish educational institutions more advanced than a vocational school remained in operation, and they offered nothing beyond the elementary trade and technical training required for the Nazi economy. Primary schooling was to last for seven years, but the classes {{in the final two}} years of the <b>program</b> <b>were</b> to be limited to meeting one day per week. There was no money for heating of the schools in winter. Classes and schools were to be merged, Polish teachers dismissed, and the resulting savings used to sponsor the creation of schools for children of the German minority or to create barracks for German troops. No new Polish teachers were to be trained. The educational curriculum was censored; subjects such as literature, history and geography were removed. Old textbooks were confiscated and school libraries were closed. The new educational aims for Poles included convincing them that their national fate was hopeless, and teaching them to be submissive and respectful to Germans. This was accomplished through deliberate tactics such as police raids on schools, police inspections of student belongings, mass arrests of students and teachers, and the use of students as forced laborers, often by transporting them to Germany as seasonal workers.|$|E
5|$|Mark Gyrion, Daley's second cousin, was a {{superintendent}} of garages for the City's Water Management Department, and among his duties was deciding when City-owned trucks should be sold for scrap.
