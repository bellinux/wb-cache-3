5|$|After {{striking}} Tulagi, Yorktown rejoined with Lexington, {{and the two}} carriers {{engaged the}} rest of the Japanese forces involved in the Mo operation from 6–8 May in the Battle of the Coral Sea. In the battle, Lexington was sunk and Yorktown was damaged. The Japanese suffered Shōhō sunk, a fleet carrier heavily damaged, and heavy losses to their carrier aircraft and aircrews. Fearing more damaging attacks from Allied land-based aircraft or warships and unable because of their aircraft losses to provide adequate air cover for their naval surface forces, the Japanese turned back from their planned assault on <b>Port</b> <b>Moresby</b> with the intention of trying again later. The next Japanese seaborne attempt to take <b>Port</b> <b>Moresby,</b> however, never happened, mainly because of their navy's defeat in June at the Battle of Midway. Instead, the Japanese decided to try to take <b>Port</b> <b>Moresby</b> in an ultimately unsuccessful overland attack along the Kokoda Track. The failure to take <b>Port</b> <b>Moresby</b> in May 1942 would have significant and far-reaching strategic implications, many of which involved the small Japanese naval base at Tulagi.|$|E
5|$|No.33 Squadron, {{operating}} ex-Qantas Short Empire flying {{boats and}} several smaller transports, {{was raised in}} NEA on 19February 1942. Earlier that month, Lukis warned higher command of the poor state of preparedness and low morale of Australian Army troops at <b>Port</b> <b>Moresby,</b> {{due to lack of}} air cover and apparent lack of interest from government echelons. On 25February, Nos.3 and 4Fighter Sector Headquarters were established to coordinate fighter operations; they were based at Townsville and <b>Port</b> <b>Moresby</b> respectively. Seventeen P-40 Kittyhawks of No.75 Squadron, recently formed at Townsville, were deployed to <b>Port</b> <b>Moresby</b> in mid-March. Commanded by Squadron Leader John Jackson, the squadron suffered heavy losses in the ensuing battle. At one point NEA headquarters gave Jackson permission to withdraw but he refused, and the squadron was eventually credited with destroying thirty-five Japanese aircraft in the air and on the ground, securing <b>Port</b> <b>Moresby</b> until relieved by the 35th and 36th Squadrons of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF), operating P-39 Airacobras.|$|E

5|$|The Australian Chiefs of Staff {{identified}} <b>Port</b> <b>Moresby</b> as {{an important}} outpost early in the war. A company of the 15th Infantry Battalion was sent to <b>Port</b> <b>Moresby</b> in July 1940 and in October {{was transferred to the}} 49th Infantry Battalion. In February 1941, the Chiefs of Staff decided to reinforce the garrison by sending the rest of the 49th Infantry Battalion, a Militia unit, but specially enlisted for service in the tropics.|$|E
5|$|The first Japanese {{air raid}} on <b>Port</b> <b>Moresby</b> {{occurred}} on 3 February 1942, and the one-hundredth on 23 January 1943. The anti-aircraft gunners shot down their first Japanese aircraft on 28 February, during a raid {{in which two}} RAAF Catalinas were destroyed. The February raids touched off panic, disorder and looting which Morris {{did not have the}} provost resources to control. The first fighter aircraft, Kittyhawks of No. 75 Squadron RAAF under the command of Squadron Leader John Francis Jackson, reached <b>Port</b> <b>Moresby</b> on 21 March, flying by way of Horn Island because they lacked the range to fly directly from Townsville. They soon became involved in the Battle of <b>Port</b> <b>Moresby,</b> taking heavy losses, and were relieved by the Bell P-39 Airacobras of the US 35th and 36th Fighter Squadrons on 30 April.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Neil Hamilton Fairley and Major Ian Murray Mackerras visited <b>Port</b> <b>Moresby</b> in June 1942, {{and noted}} that the {{garrison}} had suffered 1,184 cases of malaria, an infection rate of 149 per thousand. They recommended that to conserve quinine, men could be taken off it during the dry season, and observed for relapses. Fortunately, the climate in the Owen Stanley Range was not favourable to mosquitoes, and most cases were relapses by men infected in <b>Port</b> <b>Moresby</b> or Syria. Potts therefore decided on 24 August that anti-malarial precautions were no longer necessary.|$|E

5|$|Elsewhere, on 7 August 1942, US forces {{carried out}} an amphibious landing on Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands, which caught the Japanese by surprise. To counter this, a large naval force was dispatched, {{as well as}} part of the 41st Infantry Regiment, which had been {{intended}} to join Horii's force but was diverted, as Japanese attention and resources turned towards the fighting against US forces in the Solomons. The engagements around Kokoda and the US landing at Guadalcanal caused General Harukichi Hyakutake, 17th Army commander in Rabaul, to re-consider the drive on <b>Port</b> <b>Moresby.</b> It was realised that more supplies would be needed and an amphibious landing around Milne Bay was planned for late August. By 16 August, the decision to capture <b>Port</b> <b>Moresby</b> was postponed until Milne Bay was captured and the situation on Guadalcanal was resolved. Consequently, on 28 August Horii's South Sea Detachment was ordered to position itself at a suitable location south of the Owen Stanleys to capture <b>Port</b> <b>Moresby</b> once the strategic situation elsewhere had been resolved in Japan's favour.|$|E
5|$|Following the Battle of the Coral Sea, the Japanese {{abandoned}} {{the attempt to}} capture <b>Port</b> <b>Moresby</b> from the sea and, on 21 July, landed ground forces at Buna in north-east Papua. After capturing the town of Kokoda {{for the second time}} on 9 August, the Japanese began advancing along the Kokoda Track towards <b>Port</b> <b>Moresby.</b> The 2,500-strong Japanese force met the 39th and 53rd Infantry Battalions, at the town of Isurava. As the battle was beginning to develop, on 26 August, members of the 2/14th, including Kingsbury, arrived at Isurava to reinforce the exhausted 39th Battalion.|$|E
5|$|Kenney assumed {{command of}} the Allied Air Forces on 4 August. Three days later, he instituted a {{sweeping}} reorganization of the Allied Air Forces. The Australian components were assigned to RAAF Command under Air Vice Marshal William Bostock, while the American components were consolidated into the reformed Fifth Air Force under Kenney's personal command. On paper, the organization followed the orthodox pattern, consisting of V Fighter Command under Brigadier General Paul Wurtsmith, V Bomber Command under Walker, and an Air Services Command under Major General Rush B. Lincoln. But Kenney realized {{that he would have}} to maintain his headquarters near MacArthur's GHQ, which moved to Brisbane on 20 July, while the fighting was thousands of miles away in New Guinea, with the Fifth Air Force's principal forward bases around <b>Port</b> <b>Moresby.</b> Moreover, Walker's headquarters was in Townsville, as heavy and medium bombers were based there and only staged through <b>Port</b> <b>Moresby.</b> Accordingly, Kenney appointed Whitehead as deputy Fifth Air Force commander, and commander of the Advanced Echelon (ADVON) in <b>Port</b> <b>Moresby.</b>|$|E
50|$|In June 2005, {{he called}} for {{autonomy}} for Papua {{along the same lines}} as that granted to Bougainville. In March 2006, he was appointed as a director of <b>Port</b> <b>Moresby's</b> water and sewerage provider, Eda Ranu. He was subsequently appointed chairman of the company.|$|R

50|$|This was {{the first}} time that a cyclone had been called Guba {{anywhere}} in the world. The name Guba was retired by the World Meteorological Organization, and was replaced with the name Maila.

5|$|There {{was also}} a light group, the 3rd Attack Group, {{equipped}} {{with a mixture of}} Douglas A-20 Havocs and B-25 Mitchells. This group was not just short of aircraft; it was critically short of aircrew as well. To make up the numbers the USAAF turned to the RAAF for help. Australian aircrew were assigned to most of the group’s aircraft, serving in every role except aircraft commander. In addition to the RAAF aircrew with the USAAF squadrons, there were RAAF units in the <b>Port</b> <b>Moresby</b> area. No. 30 Squadron RAAF, which had arrived in <b>Port</b> <b>Moresby</b> in September 1942, was equipped with the Bristol Beaufighter. Both the aircraft and the squadron proved adept at low level attacks. Also in the <b>Port</b> <b>Moresby</b> area were the 35th and 49th Fighter Groups, both equipped with Bell P-400, Curtiss P-40 Warhawk and Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighters, but only the last were suitable for long range escort missions.|$|E
5|$|Brett's replacement, Major General George Kenney, {{arrived in}} the theater in August, and Walker was {{appointed}} Commanding General, V Bomber Command, Fifth Air Force on 3 September, with his headquarters in Townsville. At this time, <b>Port</b> <b>Moresby</b> was subject to frequent Japanese air raids, so the bombers were generally based in the Townsville area and staged through <b>Port</b> <b>Moresby</b> to minimize their chance of loss or damage on the ground. In mid-September 1942, {{at the height of}} the Kokoda Track campaign, Kenney sent Walker to <b>Port</b> <b>Moresby</b> for a few weeks to direct the advanced echelon, to give Whitehead a rest and Walker more experience. Walker attempted to lift morale by improving the men's living conditions. He made a point of small gestures of fellowship, such as standing in line with the men at meal times. But what endeared him most to his men was his willingness to share the dangers as well as their hardships, by flying a mission a week on average. In October, General Douglas MacArthur gave Kenney a dressing down for flying over the Owen Stanley Range. In turn, Kenney ordered Walker, Wilson and Whitehead not to fly any more missions. For a variety of reasons, all four of them eventually disobeyed their orders.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} inter-group relations in <b>Port</b> <b>Moresby’s</b> informal urban settlement (slum) Two Mile, through perspective of appropriation {{of space and}} water. Since the 1960 s, steady rural-to-urban migration to Papua New Guinea’s capital {{has resulted in the}} emergence of urban slums that have become home to numerous small communities or social networks. They are marginal urban spaces of intense social interactions, which redefine traditional identities and construct urban social networks. Relations between the communities are manifested in the settlements’ (illegal) water supply. Water pipes are clearly visible, laid on the surface, and form an extensive network. The appropriation of water connections is a common practice in <b>Port</b> <b>Moresby’s</b> urban settlements with even political campaigns sometimes revolving around legalising existing or establishing new water connections. In the Two Mile settlement, the network of water distribution and the appropriation of space between the different groups represent spatial concepts of home and a system of urban socio-cultural identity. The appropriation and construction of water connections thus symbolises the delineation, organisation and appropriation of urban space in the settlement...|$|R
5|$|During World War II the {{battalion}} {{was sent to}} New Guinea in 1942 {{as part of the}} 30th Brigade to defend the territory against a Japanese attack. Subsequently, between July and August of that year the unit was heavily engaged in the defence of <b>Port</b> <b>Moresby,</b> fighting along the Kokoda Track. The 39th fought several desperate actions against the Japanese as they attempted to hold out until further reinforcements could be brought up from <b>Port</b> <b>Moresby.</b> They were also later involved in the fighting around Buna–Gona. Such was their involvement in the battle that {{by the time they were}} withdrawn they could only muster 32 men and following its return to Australia, the unit was disbanded in early July 1943.|$|E
5|$|Leslie Douglas (Les) Jackson, DFC & Bar (24 February 1917– 17 February 1980) was an Australian fighter ace of World WarII, {{credited}} with five aerial victories.

25|$|No. 32 Squadron's first mission {{took place}} {{the day it}} was formed, when {{aircraft}} were launched to search for a reported enemy submarine. A few days later, the squadron undertook the first of many bombing raids on the Japanese air base at Gasmata. After only a few weeks of operations, due to enemy raids on <b>Port</b> <b>Moresby's</b> Seven Mile airfield, the squadron was withdrawn to Horn Island, Queensland, but continued to stage out of Seven Mile on its missions, its aircraft refuelling there en route to their targets. In March 1942, one of the squadron's Hudsons was the first to spot the Japanese convoy transporting the forces for the invasion of the New Guinea mainland. Later the same month, the squadron engaged Japanese forces landing at Lae and Salamaua. In July 1942, No. 32 Squadron was active in the Gona area and during the lead-up to the Battle of Milne Bay.|$|R
5|$|There were no {{facilities}} in <b>Port</b> <b>Moresby</b> {{for the bulk}} storage of petroleum products, so they were shipped and distributed in 44-gallon drums, as they were known in SWPA, where food and fuel distribution was through the Australian Army, which used the imperial gallon. A shortage of 44-gallon drums developed in late 1942. Some 150,000 went north but only 10,000 returned. New production was ordered from Rheem in Australia, and civilian holders of 44-gallon drums were urged to empty and return them. Unserviceable drums were either repaired by the Bulk Issues Petrol and Oil Depot (BIPOD) or handed over to salvage. A well-organised collection effort was undertaken by the <b>Port</b> <b>Moresby</b> Base Sub Area which resulted in over 20,000 empty drums being returned to Australia in November.|$|E
5|$|Another form of airpower {{employed}} by Kenney was air transport. This started in September 1942 when {{troops of the}} 32nd Infantry Division were airlifted from Australia to <b>Port</b> <b>Moresby.</b> Later in the campaign, C-47 Dakotas landed Australian troops at Wanigela. A year later, American paratroops landed at Nadzab, enabling the Australian 7th Division to be flown in.|$|E
5|$|During February and March 1942, the RAAF formed four {{transport}} units: Nos.33, 34, 35 and 36Squadrons. No.36 Squadron {{was established}} on 11March at RAAF Station Laverton, Victoria, {{under the control}} of Southern Area Command. Its initial strength was twenty-six personnel and one Douglas DC-2. This was gradually built up to a force of six DC-2s, as well as examples of various de Havilland types including the DH.84 Dragon, DH.86 Express, DH.89 Dragon Rapide, and Tiger Moth. Tasked with transport operations throughout Australia and to <b>Port</b> <b>Moresby,</b> New Guinea, the squadron relocated to Essendon, Victoria, on 17July. One of the DC-2s crashed at Seven Mile Aerodrome, <b>Port</b> <b>Moresby,</b> on 14September; all aboard were killed. The squadron was transferred to Townsville, Queensland, on 11December 1942. During 1943, it maintained detachments at Essendon and in New Guinea, and began re-equipping with twelve Douglas C-47 Dakotas.|$|E
500|$|The 1st Army Troops Company was {{responsible}} for <b>Port</b> <b>Moresby’s</b> utilities: the power house, freezers, electrical installations, lighting and water supply. By June 1942 the water supply was close to its maximum capacity, with the pumping station at Bomana pumping water from the Laloki River 24 hours a day. The main [...] water main ran under the south eastern end of the Jackson Drome, a prime target for Japanese air raids, and the water pipe was consequently prone to damage. From one cause or another there were 40 to 50 breaks per month. By October 1942 the reservoir level was falling, indicating that usage was exceeding pumping capacity. A new intake and pumping station was constructed near Schwimmer Drome to bring water from the Laloki River to a treatment plant and concrete reservoir on Twin Peaks Mountain. The 1st Army Troops Company assumed responsibility for its operation upon its completion in March 1943.|$|R

50|$|Flooding in Papua New Guinea led to {{at least}} 150 deaths. In the Oro Province, about 2,000 people were {{evacuated}} {{as a result of}} the flooding. Roads, bridges and 40 houses were washed away, as tides in the area reached two metres high. The provincial capital, Popondetta, had its water supply shut down, and Papua New Guinea's national airline, Air Niugini, suspended flights to Popondetta's main airport. The Rabaraba district in Milne Bay Province was also hit by flooding, with 30 houses and food gardens washed away, and forcing the evacuation of about 100 people. The government in Papua New Guinea reported that an estimated 145,000 people were affected from the flooding in Oro Province. Six days of torrential rain led to a damage total of 200 million kina (US$71.4 million). Guba was the first tropical cyclone to be assigned a name from <b>Port</b> <b>Moresby's</b> name lists since Tropical Cyclone Epi in 2003.
