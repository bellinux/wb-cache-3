40|$|This thesis {{compares the}} <b>pre-contractual</b> <b>obligations</b> in France and the United States. The {{focus of this}} study is to analyze how both legal systems deal with these <b>pre-contractual</b> <b>obligations.</b> It focuses on the {{possibilities}} given to the parties to protect themselves during the negotiation process. In event of breach of negotiations, the law gives legal remedies to the parties. French and American laws have a different analysis of the problem but they reach similar result: liability under contract law when a contract has been formed or a tentative agreement, or under tort law when no agreement whatsoever has been reached...|$|E
40|$|The essay {{explores the}} {{counterintuitive}} possibil- ity of identifying the unilateral promise as a bar- gaining configuration {{or as an}} essential re- quirement of <b>pre-contractual</b> <b>obligations,</b> and ties to briefly describe the solution adopted in the ‘mixed’ jurisdictions of Scotland and Louisi- ana, that, on one hand, offer a remarkable recap of the legal traditions of common law and civil law and, on the other, emphasize the conceptual dichotomy relating to the institute of promissory estoppel, {{despite the fact that}} the doctrine of consideration has a reduced leeway in the two legal experiences...|$|E
40|$|The Consumer Credit Directive {{requires}} the creditor or the credit intermediary {{on the one}} hand to provide certain information and adequate explanations to consumers before they are bound by a consumer credit agreement {{and on the other hand}} to assess the consumer’s creditworthiness before the conclusion of the credit agreement. The aim of this paper is to discuss the transposition of the European Consumer Credit Directive into Belgian legislation. We will analyze the <b>pre-contractual</b> <b>obligations</b> – and their sanctions in case of violation - as applied by the courts/in legal practice. Also, we will examine whether the Belgian Act is compatible with the Consumer Credit Directive, the latter being based on the principle of targeted full harmonization...|$|E
40|$|The current paper puts into context the Government Ordinance no. 52 / 1997 {{regarding}} franchising {{with the}} new concepts of the Civil Code. Thus, under the old Civil Code there were no specific regulations that {{could be applied to}} a <b>pre-contractual</b> <b>obligation</b> of the parties. During any negotiation, because the parties sent each other a series of offers, counter offers, and in the end decided whether to agree or not, some parts of a professional secret, know-how, or any other important information for one or both might be revealed to the other. Under international laws, such as the one in France, or by using internationally established unwritten law, such as the Franchising Model Contract by the International Chamber of Commerce and Arbitration in Paris, such a disclosure of important or secret information is protected from future unauthorized usage by any party or affiliate if the contract is not signed. In the view of the new Civil Code, this stage in the development o an agreement, not yet binding, is now regulated and protected...|$|R
40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on the {{internal}} relationship between the lawyer and the client. Although this topic was already processed many times, I believe that, in particular, {{in the context of the}} current case law and the amendment of certain provisions, this work may contribute to the better understanding of this topic. The thesis is systematically divided into six chapters. In the first chapter, there is outlined the nature of this relationship and stressed out the importance of mutual trust. To further break down the individual rights and obligations in detail, it is necessary to outline the formation of the relationship between solicitor and client first. It is important to note that the specific obligations imposed on lawyer legislation even before the formation of the legal relationship. Under the conditions described in the first chapter, the lawyer has a duty to refuse to provide legal services to the client, which can be considered as the <b>pre-contractual</b> <b>obligation.</b> Attorney has an obligation, although there is still no relationship between them. Considering the entire work, the second and third chapters are the most important ones. In the second chapter I push the reciprocal rights and obligations in the context of their legal arrangements, both legal and underpinned, and the professional and [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Mastering Contract Law {{explores the}} basic {{principles}} and purposes of contract law, including a discussion of background principles and traditions of private ordering. The book explains contract formation, interpretation, and the requirement of written evidence for enforcement of certain types of promises. It explores the themes and doctrines of reliance, restitution, {{and the importance of}} public policy in contract law. Chapters include all of the areas of contract law typically covered in the first-year course, including the bargained-for exchange, unenforceable contracts, performance and breach, obstacles to performance, modification, <b>pre-contractual</b> <b>obligation,</b> remedies and damages, and stakeholders other than contracting parties, including the third-party beneficiary doctrine, delegation and assignment. The organization of the book reflects the five sequential questions that frame the thought processes of lawyers and judges dealing with contracts issues. For example, before considering whether a party 2 ̆ 7 s conduct amounts to a breach, a judge would answer the question whether the parties had indeed formed a contract. In addition to explaining the major cases traditionally covered in contracts classes, the authors present common-sense examples and hypotheticals in order to link student intuitions about fairness and competition to the law of contracting. This book is part of the Carolina Academic Press Mastering Series edited by Russell L. Weaver, University of Louisville School of Law. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|The {{times when}} {{closing of the}} {{contract}} was as simple as making an offer and receiving its acceptance are long over now. A variuosly long period preceeds an establishment of a contractual relationship. During such period, when a contract is being formed, the parties exchange their requests or essential information and negotiate {{the content of the}} contract. The longer this pre-contractual negotiation lasts, the more time, money or other means parties invest in good faith that they shall be compensated once the contract is concluded. In case the closing of the contract is not going to occur, because of a party's unfair dealings, the party in harm shall be entitled to engage liability of the other contractor. In these circumstances, the party in harm shall base its claim on a pre-contractual liability, also referred to as culpa in contrahendo. Apart from determining the <b>pre-contractual</b> <b>obligations</b> and liability for their breach in general fashion, the subject matter of this thesis is mainly an effective comparison of Czech and French relevant legal regulation. Since the legislation does not currently regulate the issue of pre-contractual liability, this thesis is focused primarily on the case law issued by courts from both states. In particular, the thesis analyzes the case law of the Czech Supreme [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{contrast}} between pre-contractual discipline at common and civil law represents, for the comparative scholar, a conceptual challenge that {{deserves to be}} harvested. Trying to formulate common principles capable of overcoming national laws, the European side seems to lean towards a cautious recognition of the binding nature of unilateral promise. Both the Draft Common Frame of Reference and the Principles of European Contract Law accept unilateral promises or undertakings as effective if they are ”intended to be legally binding without acceptance”. This feature may derive {{not only from the}} agreement between the parties but also from the mere willingness to assume a legal obligation, {{in the absence of any}} paradigm of reciprocal commitment. At first glance, an approach of this kind would seem to mark a break in continuity in civil law systems, which are focused on bilateral nature of the project of autonomy, as compared to common law systems based on the requisite of consideration. However, when looking deeper into the legal fabric developed in common law systems, one can find an instrument (promissory estoppel) which, in the course of its evolution, has progressively shown a predisposition to assume the role as an equivalent or even as a substitute to consideration. On this basis, promissory estoppel is not only the legal principle charged with the task of smoothing out the rigidity of the doctrine of consideration, but it also creates some kind of functional connection to the European culpa in contrahendo. Accordingly, the comparative analysis will be articulated at both the bargaining level and pre-contractual levels discounting that the elements of the two contexts may be largely overlapping in some cases, but not at all in others. The counterintuitive possibility of identifying the unilateral promise as a bargaining configuration (which revolves around the idea that the promisor wants to stress the seriousness of the commitment) or as an essential requirement of <b>pre-contractual</b> <b>obligation</b> (which it is closely linked to the desire to protect the expectation created in the promisee) requires some crucial theoretical articulations to be reconsidered...|$|R
40|$|Promissory {{estoppel}} {{took shape}} {{in the nineteenth century}} to smooth out the rigidity of the doctrine of consideration: it is possible to suggest that promissory estoppel provides a valuable investment protection mechanism in so far as it bars the promisor from opportunistic withdrawal of his undertaking when it can be expected that the promisor’s behaviour has induced the justified reliance of the promisee (so that ignoring such reliance would be contrary to justice). Nevertheless, it simultaneously poses the problem of the adequacy of such a protection, especially where there is a margin for trading ex-post which would render the imposition of liability unnecessary. Therefore, we will see that the focus shifts from the reasonableness of the conduct during the negotiations and moves {{in the direction of the}} obligation to act in good faith. This being the original inspiration, the theory has seen further developments in North America, which created an exception and became, to a greater extent, an alternative principle to the traditional theory of consideration based on the bargaining principle (which requires that there be some type of exchange bringing value, monetary or otherwise, to both parties). Therefore, although the traditional version of promissory estoppel relaxes the rigor of this approach emphasizing the element of induced reliance, the new course marks a sharp break from the traditional approach. In a broader view, the idea is that the unilateral promise is intended precisely to reassure the beneficiary about the seriousness of the undertaking and, consequently, to induce him to act on another’s commitment. Thus, the focus shifts from the reliance of the recipient to the willingness of the promisor to assume the commitment. As a result, promissory estoppel ceases to appear as an exception and becomes, to a greater extent, an alternative principle to the traditional theory. From the comparative scholar’s perspective this picture is particularly intriguing and filled with fascinating suggestions. The counter-intuitive possibility of identifying the unilateral promise as a bargaining configuration (which revolves around the idea that the promisor wants to stress the seriousness of the commitment) or as an essential requirement of <b>pre-contractual</b> <b>obligation</b> (where it is closely linked to the desire to protect the expectation created in the promisee) requires some crucial theoretical articulations to be reconsidered. The following notes are the first steps on the path towards uncovering and examining this complex conceptual chain...|$|R
