Methods Semen and blood from 680 men [mean (SD) age 34 (10) years] from Greenland, Sweden, Warsaw (Poland) and Kharkiv (Ukraine) were collected. Persistent organohalogen <b>pollutant</b> <b>exposure</b> was assessed by measuring serum levels of 2, 2, 4, 4, 5, 5 '-hexachlorobiphenyl (CB- 153) and dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethene (p,p'-DDE). Semen characteristics (volume, sperm concentration, total count proportion of progressively motile and morphology) and DNA fragmentation index (DFI) were determined. CAG and GGN repeat lengths were determined by direct sequencing of leukocyte DNA. Results A statistically significant interaction {{was found between the}} CB- 153 group and CAG repeat category in relation to sperm concentration and total sperm count (P= 0. 03 and 0. 01, respectively). For p,p'-DDE, in the European cohorts a significant interaction was found in relation to DFI (P= 0. 01). For CAG< 20, sperm concentration and total sperm count were 35 and 42 % lower, respectively, when the group with CB- 153 exposure above median was compared with that below the median.

Results were compared with those for sham-exposed animals and for rats exposed to ozone alone. Air <b>pollutant</b> <b>exposures,</b> inside stainless steel chambers, were one time only for 4 h. The end points for evaluation of effects were measurements of early and late rates of clearance of radiolabeled Insoluble tracer particles.

40|$|While {{numerous}} studies have linked exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM 2. 5) to adverse health outcomes (e. g., asthma, cardiovascular disease), less is known about which specific components of PM 2. 5 drive these associations. Because PM 2. 5 composition varies spatially with sources, characterizing fine-scale variation in constituents is critical to improving epidemiological studies on health effects of source-specific PM 2. 5. One approach for improving this characterization may be hybrid models wherein source-specific dispersion covariates are integrated into land use regression models (LURs). The objective of this dissertation was to develop hybrid dispersion-LUR models for PM 2. 5, black carbon (BC), and steel-related PM 2. 5 constituents [lead (Pb), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), and zinc (Zn) ], by combining concentrations data from spatial saturation monitoring with daily Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulatory data. These models were used to assign residence-based exposure estimates for time windows of interest for two Pittsburgh-area epidemiological cohorts. The first epidemiologic study examined associations between one-year <b>pollutant</b> <b>exposures</b> and levels of both circulating and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -stimulated inflammatory mediators in the Adult Health and Behavior II (AHAB II) cohort. We found that exposures to PM 2. 5 and BC were associated with higher LPS-stimulated IL- 1 β, IL- 6, and TNF-α. Pb was associated with increased stimulated TNF-α (p = 0. 02) and IL- 1 β (p = 0. 02), but were insignificant after adjusting for multiple comparisons (Bonferroni correction). No <b>pollutant</b> <b>exposures</b> were associated with circulating IL- 6 or CRP.

These results suggest that, although pollutants were not associated with circulating inflammatory mediators or brain morphology in these samples of healthy midlife adults, some chronic air pollution exposures may influence immune responsiveness, influencing risk for future inflammatory conditions. Taken together, these results indicate the public health importance of better understanding relationships between long-term source-specific PM 2. 5 and component exposures with functional indicators of immune responsiveness and other processes shaping risk for future health effects...|$|R

Exposure of ruminants, as for all other animals, is unavoidable and while the levels of exposure to most chemicals are usually too low to induce any physiological effects, combinations of pollutants can act additively or synergistically to perturb multiple physiological systems at all ages but particularly in the developing foetus. In sheep, organs affected by <b>pollutant</b> <b>exposure</b> include the ovary, testis, hypothalamus and pituitary gland and bone. Reported effects of exposure include changes in organ weight and gross structure, histology and gene and protein expression but these changes are not reflected in changes in reproductive performance under the conditions tested. These results illustrate the complexity of the effects of endocrine disrupting compounds on the reproductive axis, which make it difficult to extrapolate between, or even within, species. Effects of <b>pollutant</b> <b>exposure</b> on the thyroid gland, immune, cardiovascular and obesogenic systems have not been shown explicitly, in ruminants, but work on other species suggests that these systems can also be perturbed.

Viaduct design is sometimes used to improve transportation efficiency but possibly affects urban airflow and the resultant exposure risk, which have been rarely investigated so far. The personal intake fraction (P_IF) {{is defined as the}} average fraction of total emissions that is inhaled by each person of a population (1 ppm= 1 × 10 - 6), and the daily carbon monoxide (CO) <b>pollutant</b> <b>exposure</b> (Et) is estimated by multiplying the average concentration of a specific micro-environment within one day. As a novelty, by considering time activity patterns and breathing rates in various micro-environments for three age groups, this paper introduces IF and Et into computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation to quantify the impacts of street layouts (street width/ building height W/H= 1, 1. 5, 2), source location, viaduct settings and noise barriers on the source-exposure correlation when realistic CO sources are defined. Narrower streets experience larger P_IF (1. 51 - 5. 21 ppm) and CO exposure, and leeward-side buildings always attain higher vehicular <b>pollutant</b> <b>exposure</b> than windward-side. Cases with a viaduct experience smaller P_IF (3. 25 - 1. 46 ppm) than cases without a viaduct (P_IF= 5. 21 - 2. 23 ppm) if the single ground-level CO source is elevated onto the viaduct. With two CO sources (both ground-level and viaduct-level), daily CO exposure rises 2. 80 - 3. 33 times but P_IF only change slightly. Noise barriers above a viaduct raise concentration between barriers, but slightly reduce vehicular exposure in near-road buildings. Because people {{spend most of their time}} indoors, vehicular <b>pollutant</b> <b>exposure</b> within near-road buildings can be 6 - 9 times that at pedestrian level.

Routing experiments show that 50 % of 400 experiment trips achieve 30 % inhaled mass reduction for both mobile-source PM 2. 5 and Reactive Organic Gases. Also, the low exposure routes can be more fuel efficient than conventional least duration routes. •	This dissertation defines a state-of-practice digital sidewalk system and proposes a pedestrian navigation tool with the goal of minimizing pedestrians’ inhaled mass of on-road traffic emissions. Pedestrian routing experiments demonstrate that the navigation tool is able to advise walking trips that significantly reduce pedestrians’ PM 2. 5 exposure up to 90 %. As a result, pedestrians can be protected from excessive <b>pollutant</b> <b>exposure.</b> •	This dissertation also develops modeling techniques for large-scale <b>pollutant</b> <b>exposure</b> assessment for Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) residents, with spatial analysis resolution fifty times higher than previous research. In conjunction with socioeconomic parameter analysis, results reveal that in the SCAG region, low-income and minority population are subject to high-level vehicular emission exposure. This study makes it possible for community outreach and mitigation planning targeted at disadvantaged residential communities. The frameworks in this dissertation provide valuable implications for environmental transportation and justice research. Future improvements can be focused on real-time population activity collection, exposure assessment, and navigation implementation in the real world...|$|E
50|$|The direct {{benefits}} of the Clean Air Act from 1970 to 1990 include reduced incidence {{of a number of}} adverse human health effects, improvements in visibility, and avoided damage to agricultural crops. Based on the assumptions employed, the estimated economic value of these benefits ranges from $5.6 to $49.4 trillion, in 1990 dollars, with a mean, or central tendency estimate, of $22.2 trillion. These estimates do not include a number of other potentially important benefits which could not be readily quantified, such as ecosystem changes and air toxics-related human health effects. The estimates are {{based on the assumption that}} correlations between increased air pollution exposures and adverse health outcomes found by epidemiological studies indicate causal relationships between the <b>pollutant</b> <b>exposures</b> and the adverse health effects.|$|R
40|$|The authors {{investigated}} {{the risk of}} wheezing illnesses in relation to contemporaneous <b>pollutant</b> <b>exposures</b> (gas cooking, heating, and smoking) in childhood and adolescence in a cohort of 2, 289 United Kingdom subjects. Data from two questionnaires assessing wheezing at ages 7 - 8 and 15 - 17 years and one questionnaire on current and past <b>pollutant</b> <b>exposures</b> at age 16 - 18 years were studied (1987 - 1996). The 1, 868 subjects returning all three questionnaires were divided into three groups representing childhood (10. 5 %), adolescent (10. 9 %), and persistent (i. e., both; 16. 3 %) wheezing and compared with 1, 165 controls (62. 4 %) without wheezing. The estimated risks of childhood wheezing were increased by exposure to any gas in childhood (odds ratio (OR) = 1. 47, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 05, 2. 04) and exposure to a gas hob in childhood (OR = 1. 56, 95 % CI: 1. 13, 2. 16) and were increased further in those persistently exposed. Risk of persistent wheezing in adolescence was paradoxically reduced by exposure to a gas hob (OR = 0. 67, 95 % CI: 0. 50, 0. 91), possibly because of selection avoidance. Contemporaneous exposure to combined smoking by both parents was associated with wheezing in all groups (odds ratios ranged from 1. 62 (95 % CI: 1. 06, 2. 46) to 1. 93 (95 % CI: 1. 10, 3. 38)). Maternal smoking alone was associated with persistent wheezing and with both childhood (OR = 1. 90, 95 % CI: 1. 06, 3. 39) and persistent (OR = 2. 18, 95 % CI: 1. 15, 4. 14) wheezing if smoking occurred throughout childhood and adolescence. The authors conclude that exposures to gas cooking and smoking in childhood and adolescence increase the overall risk of wheezing...|$|R
40|$|The mucociliary {{clearance}} {{system is a}} {{first line of defense}} against inhaled agents, and so its compromise can adversely affect health. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide a review of data on the effect of in vivo air <b>pollutant</b> <b>exposures</b> on the clearance of test particles from airways. Data from both animals and humans are compared whenever possible, so that estimates of human health effects may be made. Mechanisms of action are also discussed, presenting the view that for low level exposures, changes in secretions are probably responsible for most observed changes in clearance. The pollutants pertinent to this review are those that are common in the environment and most likely to have impacts on large numbers of people: sulfur oxides, sulfuric acid mist, 08, NO 2, particulates, diesel exhaust, and cigarette smoke...|$|R
