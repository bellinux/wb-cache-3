5|$|All three {{thresher}} shark species were reassessed from Data Deficient to Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2007. The rapid {{collapse of the}} Californian subpopulation (over 50% within three generations) prompted concerns regarding the species' susceptibility to overfishing in other areas, where fishery data is seldom reported and aspects of life history and <b>population</b> <b>structure</b> are little-known. In addition to continued fishing pressure, common threshers are also taken as bycatch in other gear such as bottom trawls and fish traps, and are considered a nuisance by mackerel fishers as they become entangled in the nets.|$|E
5|$|Nothomyrmecia queens are brachypterous, {{meaning that}} they have stubby {{rudimentary}} wings that render them flightless. This may correlate with <b>population</b> <b>structure,</b> possibly as an adaptation in small populated colonies or by unusual ecological requirements. The alates may begin to emerge in late summer and early autumn (March or April), and colony-founding queens excavate to considerable depths underground; queens start to lay eggs by spring. Queens are univoltine and only produce a single generation of ants annually, and eggs may take 12 months to fully develop. When a colony is mature, only 50 to 100 individuals are present in each nest. In some colonies, colony founding can occur within a colony itself when a queen dies, taken over by one of her daughters. This method of colony founding may render a nest immortal.|$|E

Larson (1997) studied the morphological variation in the jaguar and showed there is clinal north–south variation, but also the differentiation within the supposed subspecies is larger than that between them, and thus does not warrant subspecies subdivision. A genetic study by Eizirik and coworkers in 2001 confirmed {{the absence of a}} clear geographical subspecies structure, although they found that major geographical barriers, such as the Amazon River, limited the exchange of genes between the different populations.

5|$|The {{evolution}} of the wolf occurred over a geologic time scale of 800,000 years, transforming the first Middle Pleistocene wolf specimen that is recognized as being morphologically similar to Canis lupus into today's dog, dingo, and gray wolf. Ecological factors including habitat type, climate, prey specialization and predatory competition will greatly influence the wolf's genetic <b>population</b> <b>structure</b> and cranio-dental plasticity. Wolves went through a population bottleneck 20,000 years before present (YBP), which indicates that many wolf populations had gone extinct {{at a time that}} coincided with the Last Glacial Maximum and the expansion of modern humans worldwide with their technology for capturing large game. The domestic dog is the most widely abundant large carnivore, and a descendant of one of those now-extinct wolf populations.|$|E
5|$|Comparative {{analyses}} between metagenomes {{can provide}} additional {{insight into the}} function of complex microbial communities and their role in host health. Pairwise or multiple comparisons between metagenomes can be made {{at the level of}} sequence composition (comparing GC-content or genome size), taxonomic diversity, or functional complement. Comparisons of <b>population</b> <b>structure</b> and phylogenetic diversity can be {{made on the basis of}} 16S and other phylogenetic marker genes, or—in the case of low-diversity communities—by genome reconstruction from the metagenomic dataset. Functional comparisons between metagenomes may be made by comparing sequences against reference databases such as COG or KEGG, and tabulating the abundance by category and evaluating any differences for statistical significance. This gene-centric approach emphasizes the functional complement of the community as a whole rather than taxonomic groups, and shows that the functional complements are analogous under similar environmental conditions. Consequently, metadata on the environmental context of the metagenomic sample is especially important in comparative analyses, as it provides researchers with the ability to study the effect of habitat upon community structure and function.|$|E

40|$|By {{combining}} evolutionary {{game theory}} and graph theory, "games on graphs" study the evolutionary dynamics of frequency-dependent selection in <b>population</b> <b>structures</b> modeled as geographical or social networks. Networks are usually represented {{by means of}} unipartite graphs, and social interactions by two-person games such as the famous prisoner's dilemma. Unipartite graphs have also been used for modeling interactions going beyond pairwise interactions. In this paper, we argue that bipartite graphs are a better alternative to unipartite graphs for describing <b>population</b> <b>structures</b> in evolutionary multiplayer games. To illustrate this point, we make use of bipartite graphs to investigate, by means of computer simulations, the evolution of cooperation under the conventional and the distributed N-person prisoner's dilemma. We show that several implicit assumptions arising from the standard approach based on unipartite graphs (such as the definition of replacement neighborhoods, the intertwining of individual and group diversity, and the large overlap of interaction neighborhoods) can have a large impact on the resulting evolutionary dynamics. Our work provides a clear example {{of the importance of}} construction procedures in games on graphs, of the suitability of bigraphs and hypergraphs for computational modeling, and of the importance of concepts from social network analysis such as centrality, centralization and bipartite clustering for the understanding of dynamical processes occurring on networked <b>population</b> <b>structures...</b>|$|R
40|$|The topological {{properties}} {{of a network}} directly impact {{the flow of information}} through a system. In evolving populations, the topology of inter-individual interactions affects the rate of dissemination of advantageous genetic information and thus affects selective pressure. In this study, we investigate the selective pressures induced by several scale-free <b>population</b> <b>structures</b> using takeover time analysis. Previous results have shown that the selective pressures induced by scale-free interaction topologies are at least as strong as those induced by random and panmictic interaction topologies. In contrast, our results show that the selective pressures induced by scale-free interaction topologies are heavily influenced by their underlying topological properties, and can be tuned from a selective pressure close to that of a random or panmictic topology to a selective pressure that is weaker than that of a two-dimensional toroidal lattice with 3 x 3 rectangular neighborhoods of interactions. We also provide a detailed topological analysis of these <b>population</b> <b>structures</b> and discuss their influence on the observed dynamics in takeover times. We show that the expected takeover times observed on all <b>population</b> <b>structures</b> considered herein can be rapidly estimated using only a few readily computable metrics of the underlying topology, precluding the need to run expensive simulations or recursive probabilistic formulations...|$|R
40|$|The {{critically}} endangered Central American River Turtle (Dermatemys mawii) is {{the only}} remaining member of the Dermatemydidae family, yet {{little is known about}} its <b>population</b> <b>structuring.</b> In a previous study of mitochondrial (mt) DNA in the species, three main lineages were described. One lineage (Central) was dominant across most of the range, while two other lineages were restricted to Papaloapan (PAP; isolated by the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and the Sierra de Santa Marta) or the south-eastern part of the range (1 D). Here we provide data from seven polymorphic microsatellite loci and the R 35 intron to re-evaluate these findings using DNA from the nuclear genome. Based on a slightly expanded data set of a total of 253 samples from the same localities, we find that mtDNA and nuclear DNA markers yield a highly congruent picture of the evolutionary history and <b>population</b> <b>structuring</b> of D. mawii. While resolution provided by the R 35 intron (sequenced for a subset of the samples) was very limited, the microsatellite data revealed pronounced <b>population</b> <b>structuring.</b> Within the Grijalva-Usumacinta drainage basin, however, many populations separated by more than 300 kilometers showed signals of high gene flow.

40|$|The role of {{geographic}} isolation in marine microbial speciation is hotly debated {{because of the}} high dispersal potential and large population sizes of planktonic microorganisms and the apparent lack of strong dispersal barriers in the open sea.

Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis implies that under appropriate geographic and environmental circumstances, like the pronounced climatic changes in the Pleistocene, <b>population</b> <b>structuring</b> may lead to speciation and hence may {{play an important role in}} diversification of marine planktonic microorganisms.

40|$|International audienceSeed {{dormancy}} {{and size}} are two important life-history traits that interplay as adaptation to varying environmental settings. As evolution of both traits involves correlated selective pressures, {{it is of}} interest to comparatively investigate {{the evolution of the}} two traits jointly as well as independently. We explore evolutionary trajectories of seed dormancy and size using adaptive dynamics in scenarios of deterministic or stochastic temperature variations. Ecological dynamics usually result in unbalanced <b>population</b> <b>structures,</b> and temperature shifts or fluctuations of high magnitude give rise to more balanced ecological structures. When only seed dormancy evolves, it is counter-selected and temperature shifts hasten this evolution. Evolution of seed size results in the fixation of a given strategy and evolved seed size decreases when seed dormancy is lowered. When coevolution is allowed, evolutionary variations are reduced while the speed of evolution becomes faster given temperature shifts. Such coevolution scenarios systematically result in reduced seed dormancy and size and similar unbalanced <b>population</b> <b>structures.</b> We discuss how this may be linked to the system stability. Dormancy is counter-selected because population dynamics lead to stable equilibrium, while small seeds are selected as the outcome of size-number trade-offs. Our results suggest that unlike random temperature variation between generations, temperature shifts with high magnitude can considerably alter <b>population</b> <b>structures</b> and accelerate life-history evolution.
