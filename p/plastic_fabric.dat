5000|$|Poor {{workmanship}} on {{the early}} cars {{was a source of}} some disappointment. [...] Nevertheless, fairly soon (and in the absence of much direct competition during its early years on the German market) the Ford Taunus 12M, with its roomy modern body came {{to be seen as a}} high quality product, but on launch it was 37% more expensive than the 1952 price of the predecessor model. By this time another 1200 cc small car, the Volkswagen Beetle, was also gaining a foothold in the market place, and while the Volkswagen could not compete with the new Taunus 12M on cabin space, its lower price offered a compelling argument in a country still impoverished after the traumas of war and national defeat. By the end of 1952 the old Taunus had disappeared from the Ford showrooms, and in December 1952 management decided to offer a stripped down version of the new Taunus 12M, with all the chrome trimmings and various other [...] "unnecessary" [...] elements removed. In place of the US-style front bench seat the basic version had two individual front seats which comprised simple non-adjustable steel frames with a thin coating of <b>plastic</b> <b>fabric.</b> In place of the US-style column-mounted gear change the stripped down version featured a gear lever in the middle of the floor between the two front seats: this was considered very old fashioned at the time. The basic Ford Taunus 12 was offered only as a two-door saloon/sedan. The stripped down Taunus 12 nevertheless retailed at more than 10% less than the price of a Ford Taunus 12M. And for only forty marks extra, the buyer of the basic car could upgrade his gear-change mechanism to the coveted column-mounted device.|$|E

40|$|Presented on January 14, 2013 from 3 : 00 to 4 : 00 pm in Marcus Nanotechnology Conference room 1116. Runtime: 53 : 54 minutes. Despite their {{everyday}} familiarity, thin sheets (paper, <b>plastic,</b> <b>fabric,</b> etc.) display remarkable and complex behaviors that still challenge theoretical description. The intricate coupling between {{the geometry of}} surfaces and the elasticity of a thin sheet necessarily leads {{to the formation of}} singularities, nonlinear elasticity, and geometric frustration. Nevertheless, multicellular organisms - like you - develop their three dimensional structures in part by exploiting these elastic phenomena. These considerations have led to new theoretical and experimental tools to shape elastic sheets into prescribed 3 D shapes using the principles of non-Euclidean geometry. I will describe our attempts to design sheets that fold controllably into 3 D structures and some related problems in the mechanics of origami, where 3 D structure is developed by folding a piece of paper. These techniques open up new avenues in "experimental mathematics", allowing us to explore geometry experimentally...|$|E

The material is metallized <b>plastic</b> <b>fabric,</b> a spinoff from space programs. Wall coverings are one of many consumer applications of aluminized plastic film technology developed for NASA by a firm later bought by King-Seeley Thermos Company, Winchester, Massachusetts, which now produces the material. The original NASA use was in the Echo 1 passive communications satellite, a "space baloon" made of aluminized mylar; the high reflectivity of the metallized coating enabled relay of communications signals from one Earth station to another by "bouncing" them off the satellite. The reflectivity feature also made the material an extremely efficient insulator and it was subsequently widely used in the Apollo program for such purposes as temperature control of spacecraft components and insulation of tanks for fuels that must be maintained at very low temperatures. I Used as a wall covering, the aluminized material offers extra insulation, reflects light and I resists cracking.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyse the {{interaction}} between art and contested notions of Hong Kong identity by examining recent installations that employ the red, white and blue-striped <b>plastic</b> <b>fabric,</b> locally known in Hong Kong as red-white-blue (紅白藍). The red-white-blue fabric has, in recent years, become a signifier of the collective identity of Hong Kong people and of the ‘Hong Kong spirit’, with specific reference to the traits of the working class in the 1960 s. The repeated articulations of this material in artworks show that there are certain qualities in this material with which local people identify. This study examines how installation works that employ this material question and revise notions of Hong Kong identity, and suggest its plurality and mutability. Works of local artists including Stanley Wong (a. k. a. Anothermountainman), Kith Tsang, Doris Wong, Siu King Chung and Tim Li are discussed in detail. Accounts of installations that employ red-white-blue often offer a limited interpretation of such works, paying insufficient attention to formal qualities and assuming a fixed and unitary notion of Hong Kong identity. The thesis argues that this paradigmatic cliché about Hong Kong identity is also expressed in the red-white-blue works of Stanley Wong to the extent that they evoke nostalgia and neglect contemporary social reality. The prevalence of such readings of red-white-blue-inspired works of art has veiled the complexity of works that interrogate Hong Kong identity from a diversity of perspectives. The contribution of this thesis is to remedy that situation, and provide a comprehensive account of key red-white-blue installation works...|$|E
40|$|The ductile to brittle {{deformation}} and {{the associated}} hydrothermal mineralogical record in Holes 920 B and 920 D perido-tites are complex. Remnants of a high-temperature phase (brown hornblende, talc) are preserved in the seΦentinized harzburg-ites. Primary chromites in the harzburgite are altered to ferritchromite. Magnetite, which originated from olivine breakdown during seΦβntinization, (1) recrystallizes, mimicking mesh and ribbon textures, and (2) reorganizes in veins and trails. Primary sulfide minerals rarely survive the extensive seΦentinization, and are affected by significant mobilization. An ilvaite + chlorite + fibrous salitic pyroxene ± carbonate ± grandite garnet + magnetite ± sulfides (pyrite> pyrrhotite> chalcopyrite) assemblage that developed in pyroxenite veins is cut by later seΦentine veins. Late hydrothermal veins, pyrite (+ silicates) precipitate in veins, which are cut in turn by pyrrhotite + chalcopyrite (+ phyllosilicate) veins. PETROGRAPHIC FEATURES Petrographic features and intersection criteria allow us to discrim-inate three main events in Holes 920 B and 920 D harzburgites: (1) hy-drous alteration preceding serpentinization, (2) the main serpentini-zation, and (3) late processes that overprint the serpentinite texture. A polyphase set of composite macroscopic veins is developed through the peridotite and is less developed in gabbro and diabase in-tervals. Pyroxenitic and gabbroic veins of magmatic origin are dis-cordant with the high-temperature <b>plastic</b> <b>fabric,</b> and predate the de-velopment of serpentine-bearing veins (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1995, fig. 22). Vein systems are the most characteristic features associated with fluid introduction during serpentinization, and control metamorphic recrystallization during uplift.

40|$|The Living-Filter {{is a novel}} {{floating}} emergent treatment wetland {{design that}} combines a hydroponic plant-bed with curtains and baffles. Thames Water Utilities and AquaticEngineering UK designed and installed the Living-Filter in Farmoor II reservoir, Oxfordshire, UK, in July 2012. The aim {{is to reduce the}} phytoplankton biomass prior to the water treatment works intake. The plant-bed (1  m H ×  21  m W ×  10  m L) supports plants of Phragmites australis, Phalaris arundinacea and Carex acutiformis, with a combined system of curtains and baffles that aid the water to flow through the Living-Filter. All the water treated at the water treatment works has passed through the Living-Filter. The roots and a <b>plastic</b> <b>fabric</b> increase the surface area for biofiltration processes and the rhizosphere provides refuge for zooplankton. The research attempts to answer the question: Can the Living-Filter be used as an in-reservoir pre-treatment filtration process for reducing the phytoplankton biomass onto the water treatment works? Weekly surveys were carried out from July to October 2013 at sixteen sampling sites to measure physico-chemical and biological variables. The results for the first year of study show: (1) Soluble manganese, dissolved inorganic nitrogen and nitrites were significantly lower after treatment through the Living-Filter. (2) Chlorophyll-a removal efficiency was up to 45 % during the first seven weeks. (3) Zooplankton abundance was more stable within the rhizosphere than in the water column. (4) The aerial shoots of the plants developed well, but based on root development only Phalaris and Carex should be considered for future designs. This work highlights the potential of the Living-Filter for phytoplankton reduction, but it also addresses questions that will further improve the system...|$|E
