40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of a research regarding the application of cogeneration plants, based on organic rankine cycle (ORC), fed with wood residuals. In {{the first part of the}} paper an energy audit of the companies in a furniture industry district, located in the North-East of Italy, is presented. On the basis of these data a typical electricity/thermal demand profile dependent on the number of employees has been determined. In order to evaluate the potential savings achievable with an ORC cogeneration plant, a numerical simulation model has been developed to analyse the energy balances of the components as well as the whole ORC power plant performance. The effects on the system energy and exergy efficiencies of different binary and ternary mixtures of <b>polisiloxane</b> as working fluid and of different operating modes (cogeneration or pure electricity production) have been analysed, also in off-design conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} a series of {{laboratory}} tests, carried out on the bioclastic limestone used {{in the construction of the}} Murcia cathedral, are presented in this paper in order to evaluate the efficiency of certain treatment products, that eventually could be applied to that stone for improving their state of conservation. Additionally, the behaviour under accelerated ageing tests of non treated samples and the treated ones with the different products employed -ethyl silicate, oligomeric <b>polisiloxane</b> and poliurethane-, is compared. En el presente trabajo se recogen los resultados de una serie de experimentos de laboratorio realizados con la caliza bioclástica utilizada en la construcción de la catedral de Murcia, con el fin de conocer la idoneidad de ciertos productos de tratamiento que eventualmente podrían aplicarse a dicha piedra para mejorar su estado de conservación. Además, se compara el comportamiento, frente a diversos ensayos de envejecimiento artificial acelerado, de la piedra sin tratar y tratada con los diferentes productos ensayados: silicato de etilo, polisiloxano oligomérico y poliuretano...|$|E
50|$|The {{character}} of the backbone, i.e. its flexibility, determines the thermal properties of the polymer (such as the glass transition temperature). For example, in <b>polisiloxanes,</b> the backbone chain is very flexible, which results in a very low glass transition temperature of -123 °C. The polymers with rigid backbones are prone to crystallization (e.g. polythiophenes) in thin films and in solution. Crystallization in its turn affects the optical properties of the polymers, its optical band gap and electronic levels.|$|R
