40|$|International audiencePhtalocyanine {{compounds}} {{deserved a}} considerable interest in recent times, particularly {{because of their}} possible use {{in the field of}} nanoelectronics. In particular, the charge mobility (of both electrons and holes) in <b>phtalocyanine</b> stacked arrangements has been recently extensively investigated. The present work focuses on the study of the hole-transfer mechanism between two <b>phtalocyanine</b> monomers. For an interdisk distance larger than 4. 5 bohrs, the eclipsed dimer exhibits a mixed-valence behavior, with a saddle point transition state separating two equivalent minima. This behavior, however, is strongly dependent on the relative angle between the disks. In particular, the mixed-valence character of the compound is strongly enhanced for arrangements that are far from the eclipsed geometry. Moreover, for values of the angle close to π/ 8 and 3 π/ 8, the ground and excited transition states have exactly the same energy, thus implying the presence of a conical intersection. These results can have deep implication in the charge transfer along <b>phtalocyanine</b> chains...|$|E

The intramolecular interaction between two metal centers is an intriguing research field due to their bonding nature and cooperative effects arising from the metallic centers interaction, which dramatically modify the chemical and physical behavior in comparison to its mononuclear counterpart in organometallic and inorganic compounds, leading to desirable properties for applications in molecular electronics, catalysis and other areas of material science. It is well established, that the variation of the metallic centers from a lighter (i. e. first row of transition metals) to heaviest counterpart leads to enhanced relativistic effects.

The structures ITO/ZnPc/C 60 /C 60 :AOB/Al with a reasonable energy conversion efficiency of ∼ 1. 5 % were investigated. The samples were aged for 1300 hours upon illumination with blue LED, with peak emission at 475 nm, and incident light power density of 10 mW/cm 2. The aged devices showed a strong and fast degradation of the short circuit current and of the fill factor after several hours followed by an almost constant behaviour of these values.

This thesis work {{concerns about}} the preparation, characterization and catalytic activities evaluation of (substituted) aryl and metallophthalocyanines films-modified glassy carbon (GC) electrodes towards nitrate electrochemical reduction in acidic aqueous media. The surface modification techniques adopted consisted of the electroreduction of 4 -substituted aryl diazonium salts and the metallophthalocyanine (MPc) powder abrasive adsorption. Through a complex mechanism involving the reactants and products adsorptions on the substrate surface, the electroreduction of aryl diazonium salts leads to the covalent attachment of mono as well as multilayers of aryl groups on the substrate surface. Detailed voltammetric investigations enabled to conclude, decisively for the first time, that the diazonium cation reduction begins to {{take place on the}} bulk (whole) surface and, depending upon the concentration and/or the products grafting efficiency, may continue to take place across the microscopic pinholes formed among the aryl groups grafted on the surface during the previous reduction step, thereby explaining the origin of the two reduction peaks in the voltammograms on GC surface. Electrochemical characterization of 4 -nitrophenyl(NP) -modified surfaces in various types of aqueous media shed light over a number of mechanistic aspects of the process. Some new electrochemical evidences of the complications of surface coverage determination of redox centers from their electrochemical responses and of the role of aqueous electrolyte species transport on the responses have been presented. Some new phenomena or observations such as identification of the regions of votammograms corresponding to aminophenyl and hydroxyaminophenyl formation of the surface bound NP groups reduction, identification of the method of surface bound NP groups surface coverage estimation from the total width at half wave maximum (or electron transfer coefficient) of the responses, identification of the mechanistic aspects governing the differences of voltammetric behaviors of surface bound NP layers and the solution phase nitrobenzene, electrochemical (and XPS) evidences of the presence of azo type functionalities in the aryl films prepared from aryldiazonium electroreduction were also noticed. Barrier characters of the aryldiazonium electroreduction-derived N,N-dimethylaminophenyl-, nitrophenyl- and aminophenyl-modified surfaces towards ferricyanide, hexaammineruthenium and proton electroreductions in aqueous media indicate to the existence of electrostatic interactions among the surface bound and the solution phase ionic species. However, upon negative potential applications (such as those of water or nitrate reductions) surface attached films are partly or completely lost from the surface, as evidenced by the analytical scale measurements as well as from potentiostatic electrolysis of nitrate reduction in acidic aqueous media. Concerning the MPc-modified GC surfaces, the analytical scale measurements showed that among the phthalocyanines of copper, Iron and Nickel, the one of Cu is an optimizing material for the nitrate electrochemical reduction in, not previously reported, acidic aqueous media. The catalytic activity of MPc powders towards nitrate reduction in these media, which varies in the order CuPc > FePc > NiPc > GC appears {{to be related to the}} mental center and not with the phthalocyanine ringPARIS-EST-Université (770839901) / SudocSudocFranceF...|$|R

Transition-metal phtalocyanines are a {{well-known}} class of molecules used as model {{to study the}} interaction between metal surfaces and metal-organic compounds. These kind of metal-organic complexes present {{a wide range of}} properties and functionalities which depend on the coordination of their central metal ion, such as magnetism or the adsorption of small gas molecules. In this work we study Chlorinated Manganese <b>Phtalocyanine</b> (Cl-MnPc) molecules deposited on a Ag (111) substrate. We explore the adsorption characteristics of this system by means of a combined Low Temperature Scanning Tunneling and Atomic Force Microscope. After deposition on a room temperature substrate, a fraction of (dechlorinated) MnPc molecules coexist with Cl-MnPc on the surface. Moreover, Cl-MnPc can be controllably dechlorinated after the evaporation process. We find that both molecules are a preferential site of adsorption for molecular Hydrogen, which is known to present a bistable vibrationally mediated behavior depending on its different adsorption configurations. Inelastic tunneling of electrons from a STM can excite such bistability which induces a fingerprint close to zero-bias on differential conductance measurements. Additionally, force spectra reveal differences on the electrostatic forces exerted between the tip and the molecule when the tunneling electrons trigger such hydrogen fluctuations.

To that end, we introduce a generalized slave-boson mean-field approximation (SBMFA) which correctly describes both the non-interacting limit (NIL) U= 0 and the strongly-interacting limit U →∞, where our formalism reproduces the correct value of the Kondo temperature for an isolated FePc molecule. Our results indicate that while the isolated molecule can be described by an SU(4) Anderson model in the Kondo regime, the case of the square lattice corresponds to the intermediate-valence regime, with a total occupation of nearly 1. 65 holes in the FePc molecular orbitals. Our results have important implications for the physical interpretation of the experiment. Comment: 7 pages, 2 figure...|$|E

Materials present {{the property of}} converting near-infrared (NIR) into higher-energy visible light. Nanoparticles were prepared by optimizing towards higher emission intensity at the absorption wavelength range of chloroaluminum phthalocyanine (ClAlPc) used as a photosensitizer in the photodynamic therapy. The NIR excitation wavelength is advantageous for biological applications, as it allows deeper penetration into tissues than the UV–visible radiation commonly used for luminescence excitation. Up-conversion emission spectra obtained under excitation at 980 nm showed a preferential green emission for the Yb 3 +–Er 3 + system and a red emission for the Yb 3 +–Ho 3 + one. In the last case, by using mixtures of nanoparticles and ClAlPc the red emission (680 nm) of the <b>phtalocyanine</b> was observed through excitation by the up-converted emission of the nanoparticles (650 nm) which were excited in NIR (980 nm) ...|$|E
40|$|An {{electrochemical}} treatment (EC) {{was applied}} at different intensities to degrade the chromophoric groups of dyes C. I. Reactive Black 5 (RB 5) and C. I. Reactive Blue 7 (Rb 7) until uncolored species were obtained. Decolorization rate constants of the azo dye RB 5 {{were higher than}} the <b>phtalocyanine</b> Rb 7 ones. In addition, the EC treatment was more efficient at higher intensities, but these conditions significantly increased the generation of undesirable by-products such as chloroform. The combination of EC with UV irradiation (UVEC) drastically minimized the generation of chloroform. The photo-assisted electrochemical treatment was also able to achieve decolorization values of 99 %. Finally, mixtures of dyes and surfactants were treated by EC and UVEC. In the presence of surfactants, the decolorization kinetic of dyes was slowed due to the competitive reactions of surfactants degradation. Both methods achieved total decolorization and in both cases, the generation of haloforms was negligible. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|An in situ energy {{dispersive}} x-ray reflectivity technique {{was used to}} study the morphological changes of gas sensing thin films of ruthenium <b>phtalocyanine</b> (RuPc) (2) induced by gas absorption/desorption processes. The time-resolved collection of reflectivity spectra during the exposure of each film to a gas flux of nitrogen oxides provided {{the evolution of the}} morphological parameters (thickness and roughness). The gas absorption process develops in two stages: The first induces morphological changes characteristic of a surface (adsorption) process, while the second is dominated by a bulk effect. This two-step behavior is also observed in the desorption process: When the thermal treatment is performed at 130 degrees C, the gas is released from the bulk only. Conversely, at higher temperatures, the gas is fully released, i. e., also from the surface, and the initial film thickness is regained. Finally, a further in situ study upon a second absorption treatment was carried out: In this case, only the film bulk diffusion process takes place...|$|E
