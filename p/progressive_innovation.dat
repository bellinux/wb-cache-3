40|$|This paper accords {{derivatives}} {{a central}} role in defining the character and dynamics of financialised accumulation. Under the guise of financial precision and a <b>progressive</b> <b>innovation</b> spiral, financial derivatives have instrumentalised risk so that ownership and property take a novel form. The advent of limited liability and absentee ownership {{in the second half of}} the nineteenth century marked the start of this process of transformation. At that stage, ownership became fleeting and its relationship to the underlying technical process uncertain, loose and complex. Risk management through derivatives takes this a stage further. Derivatives imply that ownership can take a form wherein there are no direct ties to a particular asset, and therefore no possibility of a conceptual link between property and stewardship. Instead, ownership proceeds on the basis of disengagement and financialisation proceeds via the construction of indifference to the exigencies of ‘real’ economic competition...|$|E

However, national and European reports and metrics paint a mixed picture about Ireland’s engagement in and outputs derived from innovation activities. Therefore, a critique of Irish innovation policy is timely and relevant given the renewed emphasis and restricted budgetary support afforded to create new enterprises, markets, export opportunities and employment growth. In short, where innovation policy traditionally focused on funding future opportunities and capacities, micro and macroeconomic forces now requires innovation policy to be responsive to current enterprise difficulties. Through incorporating innovation policy priorities, funding streams and key policy stakeholders we find {{that there is an}} imbalance in Irish innovation policy with a legacy of prioritising and funding ‘hard’ science and technology based innovations while ignoring ‘softer’ aspects of innovation i. e. service products, business models and customer/delivery interfaces at a similar level which can be implemented at all enterprise levels, incur less costs and operationalised in a more timely manner. This policy disparity has serious consequences for our <b>progressive</b> <b>innovation</b> ambitions around entrepreneurship, scaling indigenous enterprises, creating and sustaining SME’s.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of goods for urban areas {{is vital to the}} prosperity of these areas. Nevertheless, there are various environmental and accessibility problems related to the urban goods distribution process. Only a comprehensive set of policy actions, that addresses the problems at different geographical scales and at various functional levels in concert, can solve these problems. These functional levels refer to the organisational aspects of the system (logistics), the goods transport and goods traffic means, the infrastructures, and the spatial system in which the urban goods distribution process must function. <b>Progressive</b> <b>innovation</b> is required on all these levels to achieve an efficient urban goods distribution system, efficient both in terms of commercial interests and societal interests. In the thesis, an integrated long-term problem-solving vision of a future urban goods distribution system is developed. The proposed integrated logistics concept for urban goods distribution, is based on the optimal bundling of the movements of goods (consolidation) in time as well as space. This should be done by providing logistic services, such as city logistics, backbone logistics and network logistics, in close harmony with appropriate technological means, such as advanced vehicle technologies, advanced infrastructures, and other supporting systems. The integrated concepts are based on the application of different transport systems in different areas: that is, the concept is based on intermodality. Introducing such a complex, integrated goods distribution system will require a long string of co-ordinated actions {{from a wide variety of}} public and private actors.

40|$|The June 2016 joint {{consultation}} on listing regulation arises {{out of a}} renewed concern to ensure the Hong Kong market remains fit for purpose in meeting current and emergent challenges and demands. This paper undertakes {{an analysis of the}} consultation applying a law and principles based approach. This approach requires the listing regime to be suitable not only in view of market conditions but also in view of internationally accepted practices and standards concerning regulatory oversight. While it is recognized that regulatory evolution requires <b>progressive</b> <b>innovation,</b> the two new SEHK sub-committees envisaged by the {{joint consultation}} give rise to several areas of concern. The reasons for implementing the changes proposed are not well explained in the consultation and no clear case is presented as to why the sub-committee structure would provide improvements. Putting the SFC into a frontline decision-making role is problematic under the current statutory framework, and is not necessarily a forward moving step toward a system of statutory listing regulation. It implements changes that bypass legislative intent and renders certain statutory laws meaningless, it may subject the SFC to corporate laws that would impact on its ability to act as an independent regulator, and it would diminish regulatory accountability and clarity. The risk that the changes could be regarded as legislation by regulation would weaken, not strengthen, the SFC’s regulatory mandate over public listings. These problems run counter to the intent of the Proposal to improve listing regulation and carry the risk that Hong Kong’s governance of listings, particularly the role of the statutory regulator in it, would be at odds with international best practices. The conclusion of this paper is that progressing with the sub-committee proposal would not be a positive development unless and until the issues identified in this paper are properly addressed and resolved. It is suggested that a more holistic view of market development needs to be adopted that extends beyond the decision making mechanisms of the dual filing regime and identifies more precisely the specific issues that are problematic. Doing so would permit more targeted and sustainable oversight mechanisms to be developed. postprin...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{object of}} this paper {{concerns}} specific competences development of SME's related to the exploitation and the valorisation of the Human Resource through technological innovation process. Research on entrepreneurial innovation process has developed from observing the profiles of entrepreneurs and their motivations to analysing their strategic vision and behaviour. Our research discusses about managerial practices and core competencies of entrepreneurs {{both in terms of}} innovation and human resource management. We have carried out a comparative study of Canadian and French Firms from new and traditional economy. The entrepreneurship is mainly characterised by specific capacities of animation and mobilisation of the human resource. This paper proposes a manifest illustration of this fact in the case of technological innovation process. Any branch of industry meets long punctuated periods of <b>progressive</b> <b>innovation</b> and occasional technological ruptures which call into question technologies in progress in their incremental process. These phenomena were studied with rigour by authors like Utterback (1971) or Burgelman (1983). The innovating company must then be reactive as well in its formal structures as in its competences, the profile of its stations, the careers which it offers, its culture, and more largely in its capacity to cause, support and exploit the innovations. So for a long time, the researchers realise that the innovation must be studied within the framework of its entire process (Zaltman, 1973; Rogers, 1983), the solutions considered are primarily from organisational nature (Burns and Stalker, 1961; Normann, 1977) or from strategic nature (Cooper, 1979). However, the innovation is managed by effective men and teams with many competences, precisely able to develop these organisational architectures and these strategies which accompany or influence the innovation. These actors of change are integrated more and more into the center even of the technological innovation problems. One has found, for a few years, many research on the innovation which study the key-role of these actors that one indicates under the term " intraprenors " (Kanter, 1983; Pinchot, 1985; Burgelman and Sayles, 1987). In the prolongation of these theoretical reflexions, we put here ahead the major role of the human capital mobilisation like a core-competence of the entrepreneur engaged in a technological innovation process. We have conducted a quantitative survey of managerial practices and examined 106 cases of Canadian and French SMEs from new and traditional economy so as to draw to core competencies generative of technological innovation. On the basis of a common questionnaire the entrepreneurs describe their managerial practices, their decision making processes, their strategic options, their long-term vision as well as the necessary competencies of entrepreneurship. This information is then related to their various levels of performance in order to obtain grids of entrepreneurial competencies confirmed by innovation success. Our results show that in SMEs, management styles influence the training. We can observe them in the systems of rewards and sanctions, rotations of station and the plans of career, the work team and the relations of authority. The organizations' human dimension owes to call the researchers and the experts starting from new bases : the management of competencies related to the human capital is indeed from entrepreneurial nature. In fact, the results show that the man places himself in the organizational system main part. Competencies of the individuals are not transparent, and the latter are heterogeneous and require competencies of coordination, integration, mobilisation, communication and animation specific to the contractor carrying projects. At the top of the company, one must find creators and visionaries having in heart to preserve the contact with reality. The leaders must be able to recognize and manage all the intelligence in the case of technological innovation process. The manager engaged in a technological innovation process cannot be satisfied to locate and exploit the regularities; he must also endeavour to analyse the actions in progress, to integrate what they make emerge. That is not simple and implies a deep transformation of mentalities and behaviours. The international aspect of the comparison emphasises the differences between the Canadian and French entrepreneurial systems which require different but complementary recommendations. However, in both cases, human resource is regarded as competitive advantage in the small-sized firms' strategy...|$|E

40|$|The {{pursuit of}} {{innovation}} is engrained throughout society whether in business via {{the introduction of}} offerings, non-profits in their mission-driven initiatives, universities and agencies in their drive for discoveries and inventions, or governments in their desire {{to improve the quality}} of life of their citizens. Yet, despite these pursuits, innovations with long-lasting, significant impact represent an infrequent outcome in most domains. The seemingly random nature of these results stems, in part, from the definitions of innovation and the models based on such definitions. Although there is debate on this topic, a comprehensive and pragmatic perspective developed in this work defines innovation as the introduction of a novel or different idea into practice that has a positive impact on society. To date, models of innovation have focused on, for example, new technological advances, new approaches to connectivity in systems, new conceptual frameworks, or even new dimensions of performance – all effectively building on the first half of the definition of innovation and encouraging its pursuit based on the novelty of ideas. However, as explored herein, achieving profound results by innovating on demand might require a perspective that focuses on the impact of an innovation. In this view, innovation does not only entail doing new things, but consciously driving them towards achieving impact through proactive design behaviors. Explicit consideration of the impact dimension in innovation models has been missing, even though it may arguably be the most important since it represents the outcome of innovation. ^ With this in mind, this qualitative study focuses on creating a comprehensive impact-based perspective of innovation that: 1) classifies innovations by their impact and creates a model trajectory of innovations and their impact over time, and 2) develops an end-to-end design framework informed by the impact-based innovation model. To achieve this impact-based perspective, the study engaged in a multifaceted approach with two separate yet interrelated research streams. ^ The first research stream focused on characterizing what is herein termed the enabling innovation model. Classifying innovations by their impact and understanding the development of impact over time inherently requires a definition of innovation impact. A scholarship of integration study was employed to synthesize disparate impact perspectives throughout the policy, science, and business innovation literature into a transdisciplinary perspective of the impact of innovations. As a result, in this study, impact is defined as the degree to which an innovation alters the way individuals, groups, and societies live and act, and can be decomposed into the fundamental dimensions of reach, significance, and paradigm change. To create an impact-based classification and model trajectory of innovation, a set of nine strategically selected historical innovation cases were examined, using secondary historical research sources as data, to extract themes regarding common impact characteristics, development trajectories, and possible screening mechanisms. Based on these cases and impact dimensions, the model contrasts what are herein termed enabling innovations with progressive innovations. Enabling innovations exploit a new paradigm that alters worldviews, have broad reach across individuals, groups, and societies, and significant impact across measures of economics, environment, health, and culture. These innovations generate an impact cascade that affects many application spaces, take many architectural forms, and address multiple families of problems. At the other end of the spectrum, progressive innovations build on a working paradigm, have limited reach and drive focused changes across select measures of economics, environment, health, and culture. Both forms of innovation are complementary and fundamental to societal advance, and this enabling-progressive model suggests that a few innovations drive the majority of value creation in society. The research also investigated the development of enabling innovations, highlighting three key stages: the stage of breakthroughs, the enabling window, and the progressive cascade. Each of these stages has considerable variations in impact. Study of historical cases using the model as a guide highlight patterns that can be applied to identify, screen and pursue concepts with enabling potential, especially with regard to early decisions in the enabling window that can shape the future impact of an innovation. ^ The second research stream focused on creating a framework of patterns of thought and action that can guide the pursuit of enabling innovations. Successful capture of enabling innovations, particularly while in the enabling window, requires new behaviors to proactively envision, shape, and pursue enabling concepts. This research investigated these behaviors and, in particular, the differences with behaviors typically employed to drive <b>progressive</b> <b>innovation</b> activity. This framework of patterns and behaviors - herein termed the enabling thinking framework – was developed through a multifaceted approach, integrating evidence from: 1) a scholarship of integration study on design, innovation, entrepreneurism, and learning behaviors, 2) thematic analysis of the actions of stakeholders that participated in the history of the cases analyzed to build the enabling innovation model, and 3) thematic verbal protocol analysis of 28 performance tasks with a broad population of innovation consultants, corporate innovation leaders, and faculty and students recognized as innovative in their institution. The framework is anchored in the design process and consists of a set of design patterns and behaviors that are tailored to the challenges of achieving enabling innovations. ^ The combination of the enabling innovation model and enabling thinking framework makes this research study unique, because it frames the types of innovations to be pursued for high-impact and simultaneously outlines the competencies and key philosophies to achieve this type and scale of goal. Beyond defining enabling innovation, this work aims to open up a field of study that goes from simply 2 ̆ 2 designing 2 ̆ 2 to 2 ̆ 2 designing for models of innovation 2 ̆ 2 in which innovation archetypes can guide innovation pursuits throughout society – and facilitate intentional innovation.

Local biotechnology companies specializing in Next Generation Sequencing, such as Illumina, Inc., are considered one of the leaders at the fore front of NGS DNA Sequencing. The success of Illumina???s DNA sequencing platform can be attributed to its proprietary sequencing properties known as TruSeq v 3 chemistry through sequencing by synthesis (SBS) technologies. Recently, post experimental observations have indicated several reagents have more than adequate volumes needed to conduct the advertised 209 cycle sequencing experiments. Based on our current observations in reagent utilization, this reagent overfill may represent lost profit margin, increased overhead and environmental impact. We have conducted an SBS reagent audit with hopes of determining new optimal reagent volumes needed to maximize company profit margins as well as minimize environmental impacts and overhead. Using random sampling from the Genomic Services lab at Illumina Inc., we monitored over 220 experiments for approximately 30 weeks. From our measurements, we were able to calculate lost-bottle ratios from our current reagent fills and propose new reagent volumes based on our observed fluidic threshold. In comparisons to the current volume fills, our proposed volumes would save approximately 53 SBS reagent bottles for every sixteen sequencing runs. This new volume implementation would reduce overhead cost, environmental impact, increase profit margins, and improve chemical handling. Biotechnolog...|$|R

[...] It began publication on 4 October 2007, the fiftieth anniversary of the launch of Sputnik 1. Content on the web site included news, in-depth essays, and text- and audio-based interviews. The Science Progress staff included Editor-In-Chief Jonathan D. Moreno.|$|R
5000|$|CJDS is {{currently}} located in Edgewater and {{is building a}} new campus to call home in the Irving Park neighborhood. Nestled in a tree-lined urban neighborhood in a growing hub of family-friendly programming, the new campus will {{have easy access to}} both downtown and suburban living. It's a 2.6-acre campus, complete with multiple state-of-the-art buildings, an on-site gymnasium, sports field, playgrounds, and outdoor basketball courts. CJDS will be located in vintage buildings renovated to include flexible classroom spaces and <b>progressive</b> science and <b>innovation</b> labs, where digital learning and experiential learning live in harmony while Judaism is explored, integrated, and celebrated in all areas in the school.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis study {{describes}} {{and explains}} {{the paradox of}} related languages in contact that show signs of both linguistic divergence and convergence. Seventeen distinct languages are spoken in the northernmost islands of Vanuatu. These closely related Oceanic languages have evolved from an earlier dialect network, by <b>progressive</b> diversification. <b>Innovations</b> affecting word forms — mostly sound change and lexical replacement — have usually spread only short distances across the network; their accumulation over time has resulted in linguistic fragmentation, as each spatially-anchored community developed its own distinctive vocabulary. However, while languages follow a strong tendency to diverge {{in the form of}} their words, they also exhibit a high degree of isomorphism in their linguistic structures, and in the organization of their grammars and lexicons. This structural homogeneity, typically manifested by the perfect translatability of constructions across languages, reflects the traditions of mutual contact and multilingualism which these small communities have followed throughout their history. While word forms are perceived as emblematic of place and diffuse to smaller social circles, linguistic structures are left free to diffuse across much broader networks. Ultimately, the effects of divergence and convergence are the end result, over time, of these two distinct forms of horizontal diffusion...|$|R
40|$|Precise GPS {{kinematic}} positioning in the post-processed {{or in the}} real-time mode is now {{increasingly used}} for many surveying and navigation applications on land, at sea and in the air. The distance from the mobile receiver to the nearest reference receiver may range from a few kilometres to hundreds of kilometres. As the receiver separation increases, the problems of accounting for distance-dependent biases grows and, as a consequence, reliable ambiguity resolution becomes an even greater challenge. In this paper, the status and challenges for high precision GPS kinematic positioning for the short-range, medium-range and long-range cases, in both the post-processing and real-time modes, will be presented. The standard mode of carrier phase-based positioning {{is the result of}} <b>progressive</b> R&D <b>innovations.</b> Over the last half decade or so several significant developments have resulted in this high accuracy performance also being available in "real-time " [...] that is, in the field, immediately following the making of measurements, and after the data from the reference receiver has been transmitted to the (second) field receiver for processing. Real-time precise positioning is even possible when the GPS receiver is in motion. These systems are commonly referred to as RTK systems ("real-time-kinematic"), and make feasible the use of GPS-RTK for many time-critical applications such as machine control, GPS-guide...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{isolated}} {{a full-length}} cDNA clone of amphioxus AmphiNk 2 -tin, an NK 2 gene similar in sequence to vertebrate NK 2 cardiac genes, suggesting a potentially similar function to Drosophila tinman and to vertebrate NK 2 cardiac genes during heart development. During the neurula stage of amphioxus, AmphiNk 2 -tin is expressed first within the foregut endoderm, then transiently in muscle precursor {{cells in the}} somites, and finally in some mesoderm cells of the visceral peritoneum arranged in an approximately midventral row running beneath the midgut and hindgut. The peritoneal cells that express AmphiNk 2 -tin are evidently precursors of the myocardium of the heart, which subsequently becomes morphologically detectable ventral to the gut. The amphioxus heart is a rostrocaudally extended tube consisting entirely of myocardial cells (at both the larval and adult stages); there are no chambers, valves, endocardium, epicardium, or other differentiated features of vertebrate hearts. Phylogenetic analysis of the AmphiNk 2 -tin sequence documents its close relationship to vertebrate NK 2 class cardiac genes, and ancillary evidence suggests {{a relationship with the}} Drosophila NK 2 gene tinman. Apparently, an amphioxus-like heart, and the developmental program directing its development, was the foundation upon which the vertebrate heart evolved by <b>progressive</b> modular <b>innovations</b> at the genetic and morphological levels of organization...|$|R
