40|$|Cognitive {{impairment}} is a prevalent problem {{among the}} homeless and seems related to more psychosocial problems. However, {{little is known about}} the care needs of the subgroup of homeless people with an intellectual disability compared to those without an intellectual disability and how their care needs develop over time. This study explores self-reported care needs within a broad range of life domains among Dutch homeless people with and without a suspected intellectual disability to gain insight into the transition of self-reported care needs from baseline to follow-up in both subgroups. This longitudinal study is part of a cohort study among homeless people who had been accepted for an individual <b>programme</b> <b>plan</b> in four major Dutch cities. The initial cohort consisted of 513 participants who were interviewed in 2011. At 1. 5 -year follow-up, 336 participants (65. 5 %) were also interviewed and screened for intellectual disability. Of these participants, 31 % (95 % CI 26. 2 - 36. 1) had a suspected intellectual disability. For both groups, between baseline and follow-up, the number of 'unmet care needs' decreased significantly and the number of 'no care needs' increased significantly, while at follow-up, participants with a suspected intellectual disability reported 'no care needs' on significantly fewer life domains than those without a suspected intellectual disability (mean numbers 16. 4 vs. 17. 5). Between baseline and follow-up, 'met care needs' decreased significantly on housing for both groups, and increased on finances and dental care for participants with a suspected intellectual disability. At follow-up, participants with a suspected intellectual disability more often preferred housing support available by appointment than those without a suspected intellectual disability. These findings suggest that homeless people who had been accepted for an individual <b>programme</b> <b>plan</b> with a suspected intellectual disability have care needs for a longer period of time than those without a suspected intellectual disability. Providing care to homeless people with a suspected intellectual disability might require ongoing care and support, also after exiting homelessness. Support services should take this into account when considering their care provision and planning of services...|$|E
40|$|Part 6 : Enterprise Modelling CasesInternational audienceMany EA groups {{battle to}} {{establish}} an overall <b>programme</b> <b>plan</b> {{in a way that}} is integrated, achievable and understandable to the stakeholder and sponsor community as well as the downstream implementation groups, including: IT, Process Management, Human Resources and Product Management. This paper presents an approach that achieves these objectives in a simple way. The approach is currently being implemented in a fairly new enterprise architecture function within an aggressively expanding Telco with promising results. The problem is introduced and a solution including meta model and visual representations is discussed. Early findings are made to the effect that the technique is simple to apply as well as being effective in establishing shared understanding between the EA function, project sponsors, project stakeholders and IT personnel. The technique is explicated with an example that should make it easy for others to replicate in their own setting...|$|E

In particular we review how an analysis of the development process led to: an education <b>programme</b> <b>plan</b> for development stakeholders, the definition and integration of a tool chain incorporating Unified Modeling Language(UML) and Object Constraint Language(OCL) tools, the defini-tion of UML Profiles for both Requirements and User Interfaces together with the relevant transformations (both model-to-model and mode-to-text), and an application of all these to the modification of a software module.

Twenty-five parents of adults with a severe learning disability from a hospital in Hong Kong were invited to participate in five focus group interviews. The data were analysed by content analysis.
