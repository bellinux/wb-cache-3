40|$|The brief was {{to produce}} a range of {{affordable}} and functional products for everyday use. Research undertaken {{in response to the}} brief significantly addressed the needs of the consumer. The range was designed so that it could be manufactured across a number of factories: Greece, Spain, Portugal, Poland, Vietnam and China, thus, allowing the volumes to be achieved without completely overrunning one factory with one range. The designing of each article considered the most effective production method. Also stacking of each product was a necessary part of the design brief, this facilitates ease of storage and transportation. Stacking of objects is particularly challenging but necessary for economic and environmental policies. The range also offers the same design in a number of materials: stoneware, earthenware, and glass and a number of glaze and/or glass colours and patterns. This provides different price points and also a variety of aesthetics and consumer choice. The overall aesthetic is clean-cut, which provides simplicity and easy accessibility for the consumer but also a plain surface for the addition of pattern. A workshop with Kevin Gould, the chef, food critic and food trend analyst, enabled design teams to assess current food trends helpful to designing products appropriate to the food customers are buying. Research showed that although traditional and cultural dishes remained a mainstay in consumers’ eating habits, there was a predominant demand for pasta, pizza, rice and noodle dishes particularly Indian and Thai curry. Consumers were also seeking tableware to reflect the trans-cultural character of these dishes: large 30 cm flat pizza plates, generous pasta bowls, deep bowls for noodles, and square and rectangular dishes to mimic Oriental styles. Further research into market and product availability at major international trade fairs allowed us to assess the gaps in the current market.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare, by {{mechanical}} in vitro testing, a 2. 0 -mm system made with poly-L-DL-lactide acid with an analogue titanium-based system. Mandible replicas were used as a substrate and uniformly sectioned on the left mandibular angle. The 4 -hole plates were adapted and stabilized passively in the same site in both groups using four screws, 6. 0 mm long. During the resistance-to-load test, the force was applied perpendicular to the occlusal plane at three different points: first molar at the plated side; first molar at the contralateral side; and between the central incisors. At 1 mm of displacement, no statistically significant difference was found. At 2 mm displacement, a statistically significant difference was observed when an unfavourable fracture was simulated and the load was applied in the contralateral first molar and when a favourable fracture was simulated and the load was applied between the central incisors. At the failure displacement, a statistically significant difference was observed only when the favourable fracture was simulated and the load was applied on the first molar at the <b>plated</b> <b>side.</b> In conclusion, despite more failure, the poly-L-DL-lactic acid-based system was effective.

40|$|A {{simulated}} baseball batting {{task was}} used to investigate the role of attention in hitting performance for expert and novice baseball players. In Experiment 1, we compared the relative effects of attending to stimuli in the external environment (tone frequency) and attending to skill execution (bat movement) on batting performance for college players. When non-switch hitters batted from their preferred <b>plate</b> <b>side</b> or switch-hitters batted from either <b>plate</b> <b>side,</b> attending to the external environment had no significant effect relative to single task performance while attending to skill execution degraded batting performance. When non-switch hitters batted from their non-preferred <b>plate</b> <b>side</b> the exact opposite pattern of results was found. In Experiment 2, we compared the relative effects of attending to stimuli in the external environment presented either within or between swings for novice and expert batters. For experts, attending to the external environment had no significant effect relative to single task performance in the within condition but significantly degraded performance in the between condition. Novices showed the exact opposite pattern of results. These {{findings are consistent with}} the dominant theories of skill acquisition and indicate that the optimal attentional focus varies substantially across and within performers of different levels of expertise...|$|R

30|$|According to {{the above}} knowledge, no obvious {{resonance}} responses will occur in the fundamental mode of a cantilever deck with long side L_b, for example, L_b[*]=[*] 700  m for the girder bridge studied in Sect.  3, whereas {{this does not mean}} that resonance responses will not occur in higher modes of the cantilever deck. Actually, because the generalized force in certain mode of the plate depends on the characteristic of the mode shape, the effective span of the cantilever pate could not be measured as <b>plate</b> <b>side</b> L_b but the wavelength of the mode shape of the track. It is noted from Eq. (13) that the wavelength of the mode shape of the track deceases with the increase in mode number n. As a result, no matter how long the <b>plate</b> <b>side</b> L_b is, the effective span of the plate, namely the wavelength of the modal shape, will become small enough in higher modes of vibration. Thus, significant periodical generalized exciting forces and resonance responses may occur in some higher modes of vibration of the cantilever deck.|$|R
