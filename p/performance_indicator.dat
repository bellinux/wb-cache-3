Yet, what meaning {{can be derived from}} the information that is provided through <b>performance</b> <b>indicators?</b> What role should <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> play in the governance of an infrastructure industry? This paper reflects on the coherence between public values, <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> and operational actions. We focus on two important quality aspects in two network-based industries: punctuality for the rail sector and interruption of supply for the electricity sector. We observe that <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> in both industries are weakly related to public values and to operational actions. However, although <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> have a limited meaning, they still can {{play a role in the}} safeguarding of public values. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUNDThe {{development}} of <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> that enable benchmarking between organizations {{is an important}} mechanism for accountability, organizational learning, and performance improvement. In the province of Quebec (Canada), 21 rehabilitation organizations developed {{a common set of}} <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> through interorganizational collaboration. PURPOSEThe aims of this study were to describe the rehabilitation organizations' use of a common set of <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> and to identify the factors influencing such use. APPROACHA qualitative survey was performed. Individual semistructured interviews were conducted with executives (n = 18) working at 16 rehabilitation organizations using a common set of <b>performance</b> <b>indicators.</b> A thematic analysis of the factors of use was performed according to the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. The use of <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> was categorized as purposeful, political, or passive. FINDINGSOur results showed that all organizations used the common set of <b>performance</b> <b>indicators.</b> Four factors were identified as important to all the rehabilitation organizations to explain their interest in comparative performance indicators: the need to develop their own <b>performance</b> <b>indicators,</b> the compatibility of performance information with organizational needs, complexity/simplicity of performance information, and the support offered by their common association. Sixty-three percent of rehabilitation organizations made purposeful or political use of <b>performance</b> <b>indicators.</b> Three main factors contributed to typify those organizations from the others: the perceived quality of the <b>performance</b> <b>indicators,</b> the leadership of decision makers, and the resources available. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONSOur results showed that use of <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> can support the initiation of projects for improving the quality of care. Key recommendations are proposed to decision makers that may enhance performance indicators' use...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the current proposals {{by the government}} of Alberta, Canada, to implement an accountability framework for the province's postsecondary institutions using <b>performance</b> <b>indicators.</b> The paper develops a conceptual framework for <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> based on a discrepancy model of evaluation using three metaphors: mechanical, medical, and economic. This is followed by a critical examination of <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> with delineation of potential weaknesses and strengths as well as recommendations for practice. Finally, the Alberta plan is used as a case study to illustrate the concepts developed in the paper. The Alberta plan for <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> in the public postsecondary sector is seen as reflecting an economic metaphor of <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> which will result in measuring fiscal effectiveness as opposed to educational effectiveness.

40|$|The systems {{approach}} for occupational {{health and safety}} management has gained worldwide acceptance since the introduction of OHSAS 18001 and ILO’s guidelines. Since most of the guidelines for health and safety management advocate continual improvement and accident prevention, <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> {{become one of the most}} critical tools to evaluate the effectiveness of such systems. In most practice, safety <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> are divided into two categories: leading and lagging. The major disadvantage of lagging <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> is the fact corrective actions can only be initiated after the occurrence of accidents or incidents. The disadvantage of leading <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> is their divergent nature, which might result in potential problems due to subjectivity. Hence this study proposes the use of integrated <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> to compensate for the disadvantages of both types of <b>performance</b> <b>indicators.</b> The theory of this study is based on the requirements of OHSAS 18001, successful health and safety management of HSG (65) and a guide for measuring health and safet...|$|R

The model was constructed in six steps. A basic set of key <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> was designed by a synthesis of findings from preliminary research and analysis of approaches of international institutions that {{deal with the issue}} of corporate sustainability. Through a questionnaire survey a relevance of a proposed basic set of key <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> was verified. Key <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> were verified on a group of companies which have more than 250 employees and belong to a CZ – NACE 27. 1 Manufacture of electric motors, generators, transformers and electricity distribution and control apparatus. Subsequently, a reduction of a number of key <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> was done by statistical methods so that the explanatory power of the model has been retained as much as possible. In order to model reflect a reality, weights that express an influence of key <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> on corporate <b>performance</b> and sustainability were assigned to key <b>performance</b> <b>indicators.</b> Through a literature research a benchmarks for a reduced set of key <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> were determined in order to quantify a performance gap.
