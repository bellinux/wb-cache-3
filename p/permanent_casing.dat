30|$|First item in {{the design}} steps is to {{determine}} the outside diameter of production casing. This parameter is fixed to 5.5 in. which is commonly used in Marcellus shale gas well production. The sizes of the four other casings can be determined based {{on the size of the}} production casing. The outside diameter of the coupling used on production casing is 6.05 in. As discussed earlier, the surface subsidence in coal mine area can cause large vertical and horizontal ground displacement. In this case, the horizontal displacement would cause the bending effect on the casings, which will be discussed later. As for other casing’s annular space, the Pennsylvania Code requires that all <b>permanent</b> <b>casing</b> be surrounded by a minimum of 25  mm (1 inch) of grout at the entire length of casing. Therefore according to the cementing tables of Halliburton and design code of wellbores in Pennsylvania, one can determine the sizes of other casings and couplings. After the casing size is determined, the corresponding bit size can be selected using the bit size table in Fig.  6. Figure  8 shows the schematic view of the designed casings.|$|E
40|$|One new Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) {{groundwater}} {{monitoring and}} assessment well was installed at single-shell tank Waste Management Area (WMA) T in calendar year 2005 in partial fulfillment of commitments for well installations proposed in Hanford Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order, Milestone M- 24 - 57 (2004). The need for increased monitoring capability at this WMA was identified during a data quality objectives process for establishing a RCRA/Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) /Atomic Energy Act (AEA) integrated 200 West and 200 East Area Groundwater Monitoring Network. The initial borehole, 299 -W 11 - 25 B, was located about 20 ft from existing downgradient well 299 W 11 - 39. The specific objective for the borehole {{was to determine the}} vertical distribution of contaminants in the unconfined aquifer at the northeast corner of WMA T. The <b>permanent</b> <b>casing</b> in borehole 299 -W 11 - 25 B was damaged beyond repair during well construction and replacement borehole, 299 -W 11 - 46, was drilled about 10 ft from borehole 299 -W 11 - 25 B (Figure 1). Borehole 299 -W 11 - 46 was completed as a RCRA monitoring well. This document provides a compilation of all available geologic data, geophysical logs, hydrogeologic data and well information obtained during drilling, well construction, well development, pump installation, groundwater sampling and analysis activities, and preliminary results of slug tests associated with wells 299 -W 11 - 25 B and 299 -W 11 - 46. Appendix A contains geologists logs, Well Construction Summary Reports, Well Summary Sheets (as-built diagrams), and Well Development and Testing Data sheets. Appendix B contains the results of chemical analysis of groundwater samples. Appendix C contains complete spectral gamma-ray logs and borehole deviation surveys and Appendix D contains initial results of slug tests. The non-conformance report for borehole 299 -W 11 - 46 is provided in Appendix E...|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} type of pencil casing is of thin wood, usually {{hexagonal}} in section but sometimes cylindrical, permanently bonded to the core. Similar <b>permanent</b> <b>casings</b> may be constructed of other materials such as plastic or paper. To use the pencil, the casing must be carved or peeled off to expose the working end of the core as a sharp point. Mechanical pencils have more elaborate casings which are not permanently bonded to the core. Instead, the casing supports a separate, mobile piece of pigment core that can be extended or retracted through the casing tip as needed; these pencil casings can be re-loaded with a new core (usually graphite) when necessary.|$|R
40|$|A Thesis {{submitted}} to the Department of Civil Engineering for the Degree of Master of Engineering in Structural Engineering DesignAbstract This research was done as a case study, to highlight some basic conceptual changes needed in pile designing and philosophy adopted in Sri Lanka. Even though the results are based on single case study similar trends are observed in many other projects. However, further research in this respect may be needed before adopting the recommendation given in the thesis in design practices. / Since 1960 's Cast ln-Situ Bored (CIB) Piles have been a popular choice for deep foundation in America. Bui in Sri Lanka, only now it is getting more popular. It's due to large number of high-rise buildings coming up mainly in the capital city, Colombo. In Sri Lanka. CIB piles are commonly constructed by drilling or boring 300 mm- 1800 mm diameter boreholes. / Research for CIB piles began in the 1960 s, but the recent increase in popularity of these deep foundations reveal {{that there are still}} many variables in the design and construction process that have yet to be standardized. Questions still arise as to how construction methods influence the behavior of CIB piles, such as if bottom cleanliness affects bearing capacity, or how much skin friction effect the end bearing capacity, orN how much skin friction is reduced due to <b>permanent</b> and temporary <b>casing.</b> / Foundation system {{is one of the key}} elements in any structure. Designing the foundation system with a correct safety factor is a responsibility of the Design Engineers. It can be seen that Design Engineers tend to rely heavily on the approximate design parameters given in soil investigation reports. In most cases those design parameters are not match with local conditions. Most of them are extracted from research reports, books and journals published in other countries, developed to suite their subsurface conditions. Comparatively a hard rock stratum exists below the subsurface of most parts of Sri Lanka and the compressive strength of the intact bedrock is comparatively high than the normal. However the naturally existing rock mass is fractured and hence the strength may be much less than that of intact rock specimens. Therefore, construction quality controlling of piles is a valid consideration if higher value of end bearing to be used. It is worthwhile to look at the possibility of using much higher compressive strength than the value currently used. By doing so the pile diameter may be reduced and may achieve a higher quality product with an economical design. / Other main area to be considered is the depth to the bedrock. In coastal zone it's around 10 - 30 m below the mean sea level. Another important consideration is the presence of a strong weathered rock layer at a depth of about 10 - 20 m level below the MSL, The conventional skin frictional resistance assumed for this rock layer varies fro...|$|R
