25|$|Throughout his life, Honda's founder, Soichiro Honda, had an {{interest}} in automobiles. He worked as a mechanic at the Art Shokai garage, where he tuned cars and entered them in races. In 1937, with financing from his acquaintance Kato Shichirō, Honda founded Tōkai Seiki (Eastern Sea <b>Precision</b> <b>Machine</b> Company) to make piston rings working out of the Art Shokai garage. After initial failures, Tōkai Seiki won a contract to supply piston rings to Toyota, but lost the contract due to the poor quality of their products. After attending engineering school without graduating, and visiting factories around Japan to better understand Toyota's quality control processes, by 1941 Honda was able to mass-produce piston rings acceptable to Toyota, using an automated process that could employ even unskilled wartime laborers.|$|E
2500|$|Switzerland's {{trade was}} {{blockaded}} {{by both the}} Allies and by the Axis. Each side openly exerted pressure on Switzerland not to trade with the other. Economic cooperation and extension of credit to the Third Reich varied according to the perceived likelihood of invasion, {{and the availability of}} other trading partners. Concessions reached their zenith after a crucial rail link through Vichy France was severed in 1942, leaving Switzerland completely surrounded by the Axis. Switzerland relied on trade for half of its food and essentially all of its fuel, but controlled vital trans-alpine rail tunnels between Germany and Italy. Switzerland's most important exports during the war were <b>precision</b> <b>machine</b> tools, watches, jewel bearings (used in bomb sights), electricity, and dairy products. Until 1936, the Swiss franc was the only remaining major freely convertible currency in the world, and both the Allies and the Germans sold large amounts of gold to the Swiss National Bank. Between 1940 and 1945, the German Reichsbank sold 1.3billion francs worth of gold to Swiss Banks in exchange for Swiss francs and other foreign currency, which were used to buy strategically important raw materials like tungsten and oil from neutral countries. Hundreds of millions of francs worth of this gold was monetary gold plundered from the central banks of occupied countries. A total of 581,000 francs' worth of [...] "Melmer" [...] gold taken from Holocaust victims in eastern Europe was sold to Swiss banks. In total, trade between Germany and Switzerland contributed about 0.5% to the German war effort and did not significantly lengthen the war.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. For the {{replication}} {{of optical glass}} or plastic components moulding inserts with surface roughness in the nanometre range and form accuracy in the micron or sub-micron range are needed. Despite these requirements the applied moulding insert material has to suit further needs like high temperature stability and resistivity against abrasive and chemical wear. To satisfy the specific requirements of replication processes steel alloys can be heat treated {{in a way to}} meet these demands. Unfortunately, these steel alloys cannot be machined with single crystal diamond tools because catastrophic diamond tool wear occurs. In recent years good progress in the field of ultra <b>precision</b> <b>machining</b> of steel has been made by nitrocarburizing the steel alloy. This leads to a sub-surface compound layer which is diamond machinable with surface roughness Sa < 10 nm and reduced diamond tool wear. But the ultra <b>precision</b> <b>machining</b> of these nitrocarburized steels introduces new challenges caused by the high hardness of the compound layer. Typical values are about 1200 HV 0. 025. Therefore, this paper presents results from ultra <b>precision</b> <b>machining</b> processes focusing on the material behaviour during the cutting process. Influences of depth of cut and material composition on the surface generation can be found by evaluating chip formation and the resulting chips. Furthermore, the sub-surface of ultra <b>precision</b> <b>machined</b> steels is characterized by metallographic analysis to evaluate the influence of the nitrocarburizing process on ultra <b>precision</b> <b>machining.</b> In conclusion this paper presents the results for {{a deeper understanding of the}} material removal mechanisms in ultra <b>precision</b> <b>machining</b> of nitrocarburized steels...|$|R
