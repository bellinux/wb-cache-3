6000|$|This poem was {{composed}} {{in its first}} form as early as May, 1832 or 1833, as we learn from Fitzgerald's note--of the exact year he was not certain ('Life of Tennyson', i., 147). The evolution of the poem is an interesting study. How greatly it was altered in the second edition of 1842 will be evident from the collation which follows. The text of 1842 became the <b>permanent</b> <b>text,</b> and in this no subsequent material alterations were made. The poem is more purely fanciful than Tennyson perhaps was willing to own; certainly his explanation of the allegory, as {{he gave it to}} Canon Ainger, is not very intelligible: [...] "The new-born love for something, for some one in the wide world from which she has been so long excluded, takes her out of the region of shadows into that of realities". Poe's commentary is most to the point: [...] "Why do some persons fatigue themselves in endeavours to unravel such phantasy pieces as the 'Lady of Shallot'? As well unweave the ventum textilem".--'Democratic Review', Dec., 1844, quoted by Mr. Herne Shepherd. Mr. Palgrave says (selection from the 'Lyric Poems of Tennyson', p. 257) the poem was suggested by an Italian romance upon the Donna di Scalotta. On what authority this is said I do not know, nor can I identify the novel. In Novella, lxxxi., a collection of novels printed at Milan in 1804, there is one which tells but very briefly the story of Elaine's love and death, [...] "Qui conta come la Damigella di scalot mori per amore di Lancealotto di Lac," [...] and as in this novel Camelot is placed near the sea, this may be the novel referred to. In any case the poem is a fanciful and possibly an allegorical variant of the story of Elaine, Shalott being a form, through the French, of Astolat.|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of Carlos Bulosan in Filipino and Filipino-American radical history and literature is indisputable. His eminence spans the pacific, {{and he is}} known, diversely, as a radical poet, fictionist, novelist, and labor organizer. Author of the canonical America Iis the Hearts, Bulosan is celebrated for chronicling the conditions in America in his time, such as racism and unemployment. In the history of criticism on Bulosan's life and work, however, there is an undeclared general consensus that views Bulosan and his work as coherent <b>permanent</b> <b>texts</b> of radicalism and anti-imperialism. Central {{to the existence of}} such a tradition of critical reception are the generations of critics who, in more ways than one, control the discourse on and of Carlos Bulosan. This essay inquires into the sphere of the critical reception that orders, for our time and for the time ahead, the reading and interpretation of Bulosan. What eye and seeing, the essay asks, determine the perception of Bulosan as the angel of radicalism? What is obscured in constructing Bulosan as an immutable figure of the political? What light does the reader conceive when the personal is brought into the open and situated against the political? the essay explores {{the answers to these questions}} in Bulosan's loving letters to various friends, strangers, and white American women. The presence of these interrogations, the essay believes, will secure ultimately the continuing {{importance of}} Carlos Bulosan to radical literature and history...|$|R

In Majelis Tarjih decision stated that law of marriage with kitabiyah women is forbidden (proscribed). Although, most of Islamic scholar’s opinion showed that marry with kitabiyahwomen is allowed. Based on Majelis Tarjih, it is allowed when it has illat, such as: The marriage is aimed to ask her wife to join Islam. However, in reality, especially in Indonesia, Majelis Tarjih see this case, marriage with kitabiyah women has big disadvantage for Islam community. For most of Muslims those marry with kitabiyah women will follow with their wife’s religion and their children will follow with what their mum’s believed. Majelis Tarjih thought that the illat’s exceptional will be not used to anymore, even it will be attack back, allowing will become proscribing. In this case, by using Saddu Al­Dzari’at method, so Majelis Tarjih decided proscribed, this decision is unique because the method which is used is putting the benefit “first” than nash. It contrasts to most of Islamic scholars’ opinion. So, this research has urgent for knowing the considerations, reasons, methodology and the analysis of Majelis Tarjih in deciding law of marriage with kitabiyah women. In addition, to find out how is the relevance of Maqashid Al­Syari’at. Based on this reference’s study, there are some conclusions of this decision here should be critical, they are: The beneficial which was suggested by Majelis Tarjih is proscribing a Muslim’s marriage with kitabiyah women which has aim to keep his faithful (Hifz Al­Din). It contrasts with nash qath’i (<b>permanent</b> <b>text)</b> which is allowed it clearly. Dzari’at of Majelis Tarjih is suspected to create harmful for a Muslims. On the writer’s view, it is not suitable because it is based on previous research. Furthermore, the law is viewed by all people generally. Besides, the writer suspected that this decision is caused by politis­yuridis factor...|$|E

This is similar to other operations needed when, for example, a user performs a case or diacritic insensitive search within some text. In such cases software must equate or ignore characters it would not otherwise equate or ignore. Typically normalization is performed without altering the underlying stored text data (lossless). However, some software may potentially make <b>permanent</b> changes to <b>text</b> that eliminates the canonical or even non-canonical compatibility characters differences from text storage (lossy).|$|R
40|$|Unlike {{many of its}} {{comparator}} institutions, {{for example}} the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Centre Pompidou in Paris, Tate Modern in London has not hosted an explicitly feminist exhibition or collections programme. This essay asks whether feminism has influenced Tate Modern at all. The essay identifies and evaluates different methodologies for interpreting the gender politics of a museum collection, and extends its evalution to temporary exhibitions, matters of display and other mechanisms of interpretation. The essay applies {{the results of the}} methodological discussion to the specific example of Tate Modern since its opening in 2000, considering the actual collection but focussing chiefly on temporary exhibitions (including the high-profile Turbine Hall Commissions), displays of the <b>permanent</b> collection, wall <b>texts</b> and other interpretive material that are examined through evidence acquired during site visits and consultation of archival material. The final part of the essay develops a theme raised in the book's introduction, the influence of neo-liberalism in the museum sector and the evolution of a fundamentally commercial relationship between museum and audience, to reflect on the gender-political implications of Tate Modern's popularizing the museum through the explicit use of the 'high street' as a model...|$|R
25|$|Fitzpatrick {{continues}} to develop her {{ideas of the}} importance of community with an analysis of digital text preservation in which she proposes that current technical issues with digital text preservation will require social solutions. This proposal is based on Fitzpatrick’s reasoning that difficulties in the preservation of digital texts are not caused by any quality inherent to digital artifacts but, rather, stem from our understanding of digital products and our social practices concerning their use. It is often assumed that issues with digital preservation are due to the ephemeral quality of digital artifacts. Fitzpatrick points out that this is not entirely correct, illustrating that print text is by no means <b>permanent</b> and digital <b>text</b> is far more permanent than is commonly thought. The loss of access to digital texts or their interpretability, sometimes due to incompatibility between older media formats and newer platforms, is mistakenly perceived as the loss of digital texts themselves. Establishing this fact, Fitzpatrick argues that digital preservation efforts should not focus entirely on technical solutions to technical issues, but instead should concentrate on developing socially organized preservation systems. In addition to focusing on the development of preservation practices through community organization, Fitzpatrick argues that creators of digital artifacts must take steps to ensure the compatibility of their work with preservation efforts, stating: “…planning for the persistent availability of digital resources as {{part of the process of}} their creation will provide the greatest stability of the resources themselves at the least possible cost”.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{wants to}} clarify the {{controversial}} status of two related English constructions: enumerative there-clauses, e. g. (1), whose distinctness from ordinary existential clauses like (3 - 4) has been disputed, and enumerative there-clefts (2, which are not generally recognized as specificational clefts. (1) His nomination of formative influences gives a clue. There is Brian Ashton and Jack Rowell. (WB Times) (2) Now you've got a fair sort of permanent staff now. There‘s Herman {{has been there for}} years. (WB BrSpoken) An argument often adduced for the difference between enumerative and ordinary existentials is the typical definiteness of the NPs in the former, e. g. Brian Ashton and Jack Rowell (1) and the ‘indefiniteness’ restriction said to apply to the latter, e. g. some nasty girls in (3) (Lyons 1977). As shown by non-enumerative examples like (4), where the usual drunk Scotsman evokes ‘a’ (new) instance of the familiar type drunk Scotsman, this restriction is of a semantic-pragmatic nature. Ward & Birner (1995) correctly point out that examples like (3) and (4) as well as listing examples like (1) all share the pragmatics of presenting entities that are in some sense ‘new’. However, for this reason they reject the distinction between enumerative an non-enumerative existentials. Against this, we argue that the different coded meanings of the two types should be recognized. Ordinary existentials like (3 - 4) introduce unidentifiable instances of the type designated by the common noun and modifiers in the Existent NP, nasty girls (3) and drunk Scotsman (4) respectively. By contrast, enumerative existentials like (1) name one or more – typically identifiable – instances of a superordinate type to be retrieved from the preceding text: Ashton and Rowell are instances of formative influences. (3) I went to an all-girls‘ school and there were (*the) some nasty girls there. (WB) (4) There was the usual drunk Scotsman in the corner. (WB) A further argument for recognizing enumerative existentials as a distinct type is the features they share with enumerative there-clef s like (2), whose focal NP likewise names one or more – typically identifiable – instances, e. g. Herman in (2), of a superordinate type, which is retrievable from the preceding <b>text,</b> <b>permanent</b> staff, but which is also explicitly coded by the cleft relative clause, has been there for years. This tallies with Lambrecht’s (2001) analysis of examples like (2) as specificational clefts whose focal NP non-exhaustively lists a value for the variable ‘x’ in the open proposition contained in the cleft relative clause – an analysis not subscribed to by Huddleston & Pullum (2002 : 1396). We will verify and further develop the posited similarities in a corpus-based description, filtering extractions of the query [tag=“EX“][lemma=“be“][tag=“NP|PP|DET“] from BrSpoken and Times in WordbanksOnline (WB). For enumerative there-clauses and there-clefts, we will analyse and quantify the occurrence of (i) simple and coordinated NPs, and (ii) referring expressions: proper names, pronouns, definite or indefinite NPs, and functionally interpret these in function of the listing semantics. For there-clefts, we will assess whether the proposition in the relative clause is textually evoked, inferrable, anchored or brand-new in relation to the preceding text (Kaltenböck 2004, Gentens 2016). We will then extend this analysis to enumerative there-clauses: it should always be possible to make the superordinate type explicit in an added relative clause, e. g. (1) There is Brian Ashton and Jack Rowell that are formative infl ences, which will allow us to assess whether the superordinate type is textually evoked, inferable, or possibly anchored in the preceding discourse. Presumably it is never brand-new, as it would then be impossible to decide which superordinate type the enumerative existential lists instances of. This will give us an insight into the discursive motivations for choosing an enumerative there-clause or an enumerative there-cleft. References Gentens, C. (2016).
