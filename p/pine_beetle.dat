5|$|Beetles have {{a variety}} of ways to communicate, {{including}} the use of pheromones. The mountain <b>pine</b> <b>beetle</b> emits a pheromone to attract other beetles to a tree. The mass of beetles are able to overcome the chemical defenses of the tree. After the tree's defenses have been exhausted, the beetles emit an anti-aggregation pheromone. The species can stridulate to communicate.|$|E
5|$|Other pest {{include the}} coconut hispine beetle, Brontispa longissima, which feeds on young leaves, {{seedlings}} and mature coconut trees, causing serious economic {{damage in the}} Philippines. The mountain <b>pine</b> <b>beetle</b> is a destructive pest of mature or weakened lodgepole pine, sometimes affecting large areas of Canada.|$|E
5|$|The {{mountain}} <b>pine</b> <b>beetle</b> is {{a native}} insect species that is known to experience large outbreaks that infest forest groves, and is particularly common in areas with numerous lodgepole pines and fir trees. A large infestation occurred from 1995 through 2003, and the beetle wiped out areas of lodgepole pine in the SNRA, an area historically too cold for outbreaks to occur.|$|E

5000|$|In Colorado, the <b>pine</b> bark <b>beetle</b> is {{a common}} parasite. The <b>pine</b> <b>beetles</b> lays its eggs in the pine trees, {{and then when the}} babies are born, they eat the layers of the tree which stops the tree from growing. (Robbins) ...|$|R
5|$|Many beetle species {{undertake}} annual mass movements {{which are}} termed as migrations. These include the pollen beetle Meligethes aeneus and {{many species of}} coccinellids. These mass movements may also be opportunistic, in search of food, rather than seasonal. A 2008 study of an unusually large outbreak of Mountain <b>Pine</b> <b>Beetle</b> (Dendroctonus ponderosae) in British Columbia found that beetles were capable of flying 30–110km per day in densities of up to 18, 600 beetles per hectare.|$|E
5|$|Beetles are {{prominent}} in human culture, from the sacred scarabs of ancient Egypt to beetlewing art and use as pets or fighting insects for entertainment and gambling. Many beetle groups are brightly and attractively coloured making them objects of collection and decorative displays. Over 300 species {{are used as}} food, mostly as larvae; species widely consumed include mealworms and rhinoceros beetle larvae. However, the major impact of beetles on human life is as agricultural, forestry, and horticultural pests. Serious pests include the boll weevil of cotton, the Colorado potato beetle, the coconut hispine beetle, and the mountain <b>pine</b> <b>beetle.</b> Most beetles, however, do not cause economic damage and many, such as the lady beetles and dung beetles are beneficial by helping to control insect pests.|$|E
5|$|The {{mountain}} <b>pine</b> <b>beetle</b> {{killed a}} number of trees in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem from the late 1960s through the mid-1980s. This created a heterogeneous forest in which old surviving trees were mixed with younger trees of various ages. This mixed stand structure may have provided ladder fuels {{that contributed to the}} fires. In addition, the winter season of 1987–1988 was drier than usual, with the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem receiving only 31% of the normal snowpack. However, April and May 1988 were very wet and the abundant moisture greatly aided grass and understory development. By June, the rainfall stopped and little was recorded in the entire Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem for the next four months. By July, the worst drought in the history of Yellowstone National Park began. Grasses and plants which grew well in the early summer soon turned to dry tinder. Relative humidity levels fell further, desiccating the forest. Fuel moisture content in dead and fallen timber was recorded as low as 5%. By mid-August, humidity levels were averaging below 20% and were recorded as low as 6% on one occasion. To compound the lack of rainfall, the majority of Yellowstone's soils are rhyolitic volcanic rocks and soils which have poor moisture retention. A series of strong but dry storm fronts also led to the rapid spread of {{a number of}} the largest fires.|$|E

50|$|Mountain <b>pine</b> <b>beetles</b> infest the {{lodgepole}} pine, {{which makes}} up 8% of Colorado’s 22 e6acre km2 of forests. Lodgepole pines are found at elevations between 6,000-11,000 feet. A previous notable outbreak occurred in Colorado in the 1970s but was significantly less detrimental {{than the current}} infestation. Of the 1760000 acre of lodgepole pine, about 70% have been damaged. High temperatures have allowed beetle infestations at higher elevations. According to a recent study, <b>pine</b> <b>beetles</b> have expanded their infestation by 400000 acre. The infestation is primarily concentrated in the state’s northern mountains. The infestation has been moving north and east from the Granby and Winter Park area towards Larimer County. It is estimated that beetle kill will leave behind a deforested {{area the size of}} Rhode Island.|$|R

25|$|In western North America, {{the current}} {{outbreak}} of the mountain <b>pine</b> <b>beetle</b> and its microbial associates has destroyed wide areas of lodgepole pine forest, including more than 16 million of the 55 million hectares of forest in British Columbia. The current outbreak in the Rocky Mountain National Park began in 1996 and has caused the destruction of {{millions of acres of}} ponderosa and lodgepole pine trees. According to an annual assessment by the state's forest service, 264,000 acres of trees in Colorado were infested by the mountain <b>pine</b> <b>beetle</b> at the beginning of 2013. This was much smaller than the 1.15 million acres that were affected in 2008 because the beetle has already killed off most of the vulnerable trees (Ward).|$|E

25|$|There {{is ongoing}} {{research}} with some clerid species. Forensic research is limited {{because of their}} late arrival on carrion, but members such as Thanasimus undatulus have been researched as a possible role in integrated pest management or IPM. Thanasimus undatulus is a predator of bark beetles. Some species of bark beetles such as the southern <b>pine</b> <b>beetle</b> and the mountain <b>pine</b> <b>beetle</b> can become pests to the lumber industry because in large numbers they can cause damage and kill live trees. Thanasimus undatulus has been researched as a possible biological control agent for these pests. Researchers and forestry officials have used bark beetle aggreagation pheromones to attract the checkered beetle to specific trees. This causes the bark beetles to be overwhelmed, extensively preyed upon by the clerid beetles, and typically eliminated.|$|E
25|$|According to a 2016 {{study from}} the Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions rising levels of Carbon Dioxide may cancel out the <b>pine</b> <b>beetle</b> impact in British Columbia by 2020.
