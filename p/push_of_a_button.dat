We compare against a three-control setup consisting ofa jog wheel and two physical buttons. We show that the three-in-one control enables a 13 % faster reaction time over the three-control one, but that the three-in-one control suffers a 4 % penalty in the accuracy ofusers choosing between the two buttons in response to cues from an application.

40|$|Abstract. Providing haptic cues can {{generate}} {{increased levels of}} presence in users as they interact with tangible objects. In this paper, we present button effects delivered by air-jet displays {{with the aim of}} providing click-like sensations when virtual <b>buttons</b> in <b>an</b> AR environment are pressed. We derive the profile of the haptic output by measuring the force profile of real physical buttons. To validate our concept, we have built an AR system featuring a cellular phone model which users can tangibly manipulate through a physical AR marker object. When users press <b>a</b> <b>button</b> on the model, they experience a corresponding click-like feeling at their fingertip. In this way, our system enables users to press <b>a</b> <b>button</b> on <b>an</b> AR model and experience a force profile generated by our pneumatic array directly derived from the act <b>of</b> <b>pushing</b> <b>a</b> <b>button</b> in the real world.

The Chief sold 39,000 units within six months of its appearance at the 1926 New York Auto Salon, hitting 76,742 at twelve months. The next year, it became the top-selling six in the U.S., ranking seventh in overall sales. By 1933, it had moved up to producing the least expensive cars available with straight eight engines. This was done by using many components from the 6-cylinder Chevrolet Master, such as the body, but installing a large chrome strip {{on the top and}} center of the front hood Pontiac called the [...] "Silver Streak". In the late 1930s, Pontiac used a Buick [...] "torpedo" [...] body for one of its models, just prior to its being used by Chevrolet, earning some media attention for the marque. An unusual feature of the [...] "torpedo"-bodied exhibition car was that, with <b>push</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>button,</b> the front half of the body would open showing the engine and the car's front seat interior.

40|$|The commonest way {{of killing}} in the UK is by asharp instrument. Knight {{reported}} in 1975 {{that it is}} impossibleto discern {{with any degree of}} certainty the degree of force usedto create a stab wound. Despite this, expert witnesses continueto approximate the degree of force used for their reports andevidence in court. It is usually subjectively categorized as mild,moderate or severe, based solely on the examination of thewound. We undertook a study considering forces generated ina range of blunt trauma actions, using a novel force plate dy-namometer to measure the peak forces obtained by adult maleand female volunteers. We then studied forces generated bystabbing skin simulants and porcine samples with knives andscrewdrivers. Men generated more force than women duringstabbings which was found to be equivalent to somewherebetween the blunt trauma actions <b>of</b> <b>pushing</b> <b>a</b> <b>button</b> to asingle-handed push. When asked to stab using what theythought was mild, moderate and severe force, although volun-teers were able to actively decide the force used, the actualforce was found to be influenced by the weapon, sex of theindividual, hand used and biological/anatomical sitepenetrated. This study shows that the forces generated by vol-unteers in mild, moderate and severe stabbing tests in almost allcases were significantly greater than the forces required for skinpenetration. We suggest that the use of subjective force scales isinappropriate. Rather than use <b>of</b> <b>a</b> subjective scale, we suggestthat the force required in any stabbing requires investigation infour areas: the tip radius of the weapon, minimal force requiredfor penetration, the sex of the assailant and whether the forcerequired for penetration is greater than that that can be gener-ated by a person stabbing.
