50|$|The Derby Rib {{machine was}} invented in 1757 by Strutt. It {{consisted}} of an extra set of bearded needles that operated vertically, taking the loop and reversing them. This allowed a plain and <b>purl</b> <b>knit</b> to be used, and led to ribbing and a tighter more flexible fabric. To do a 3:1 rib, there would be one vertical needle after every third horizontal needle.|$|E
50|$|Robert Levenson {{was born}} in Boston to Samuel and Paulina Levenson, {{immigrants}} from Russia and Austria respectively. Samuel was a tailor and shoemaker, and his son eventually took up {{a career in the}} clothing business. After attending Boston Latin School, Robert went to Harvard, graduating in 1917. He subsequently moved to New York City, married Evelyn Lippmann, from Edgemere (Queens), and worked his way up in the business world; at his death he was a partner in the <b>Purl</b> <b>Knit</b> Sales Company. He was very active in his local community, Lawrence, Long Island, and in many Jewish societies; a remarkably large number of tributes appeared in The New York Times in the days following his death in Lawrence.|$|E

50|$|In older tatting and {{crocheting}} patterns, picots {{were sometimes}} specified as purls, purl stitches, or pearl stitches. These specifications {{are not to}} be confused with the reverse stitch known as a <b>purl</b> in <b>knitting.</b>|$|R
50|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{stitches}} that can be created depending on how and where the hook is inserted and how the working yarn is held. Tunisian stitches include variations on <b>knit,</b> <b>purl,</b> post stitch, and entrelac, to name a few.|$|R
25|$|While most crochet is {{made with}} a hook, {{there is also a}} method of {{crocheting}} with a knitting loom. This is called loomchet. Slip stitch crochet is very similar to knitting. Each stitch in slip stitch crochet is formed the same way as a <b>knit</b> or <b>purl</b> stitch which is then bound off. A person working in slip stitch crochet can follow a knitted pattern with <b>knits,</b> <b>purls,</b> and cables, and get a similar result.|$|R
60|$|Susan {{added another}} proof to this {{concluding}} dictum of hers {{one day in}} October. The doctor {{and his wife were}} away. Rilla was presiding over Jims' afternoon siesta upstairs, <b>purling</b> four and <b>knitting</b> one with ceaseless vim. Susan was seated on the back veranda, shelling beans, and Cousin Sophia was helping her. Peace and tranquility brooded over the Glen; the sky was fleeced over with silvery, shining clouds. Rainbow Valley lay in a soft, autumnal haze of fairy purple. The maple grove was a burning bush of colour and the hedge of sweet-briar around the kitchen yard was a thing of wonder in its subtle tintings. It did not seem that strife could be in the world, and Susan's faithful heart was lulled into a brief forgetfulness, although she had lain awake most of the preceding night thinking of little Jem far out on the Atlantic, where the great fleet was carrying Canada's first army across the ocean. Even Cousin Sophia looked less melancholy than usual and admitted that there was not much fault {{to be found in the}} day, although there was no doubt it was a weather-breeder and there would be an awful storm on its heels.|$|R
40|$|Knitted fabrics {{are widely}} used in {{clothing}} because of their elasticity, comfort and recovery properties as well as diversity in pattern design and texture. Up of one yarn only. Creating a knitted pattern, especially a hand knitted pattern is a cumbersome task in the textile industry. In this paper, we extend our previous try on composition of weaving pattern by music playing to knitted pattern. We propose a direct piano-like playing scheme for composing knitted patterns on multi-input devices rather than the synthesized modes for weaving patterns in our previous try. Taking weft-knits as examples, discrete notes on the treble staff are translated into a sequence of signatures of knit stitches and discrete notes in the bass staff are translated into a sequence of signatures of purl stitches. A summation tone is translated into multiple <b>knit,</b> <b>purl</b> and slip stitches. Artists can use their right hand to knit and their left hand to purl across the needles in cooperation. The sequences of <b>knit</b> and <b>purl</b> stitches become the notes on the full gamut of shafts and treadles. Our results show {{that we are able}} to compose a family of knitted patterns in a similar way to playing a basic instrument such as a piano in a relatively short time.
