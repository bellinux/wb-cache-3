40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the time-courses of lung function and respiratory muscle <b>pressure</b> generating <b>capacity</b> after spinal cord injury. Design: Multi-centre, prospective cohort study. Subjects: One hundred and nine subjects with recent, motor complete spinal cord injury. Methods: Lung function and respiratory muscle <b>pressure</b> generating <b>capacity</b> were measured at first mobilization, at discharge from inpatient rehabilitation {{and one year}} after discharge. Lung function was measured in all 109 subjects, and 55 of these performed additional measurements of respiratory muscle <b>pressure</b> generating <b>capacity.</b> Trajectories of respiratory muscle function for different lesion level groups were assessed by multi-variate multi-level regression models. Results: Forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 sec and maximal inspiratory muscle <b>pressure</b> generating <b>capacity</b> significantly increased during and after inpatient rehabilitation. Forced inspiratory volume in 1 sec, peak inspiratory flow, peak expiratory flow and maximal expiratory muscle <b>pressure</b> generating <b>capacity</b> increased only during inpatient rehabilitation, but not thereafter. Increasing lesion level had {{a negative effect on}} all measured lung function parameters, as well as on maximal inspiratory and expiratory muscle <b>pressure</b> generating <b>capacity.</b> Conclusion: Respiratory function improved during inpatient rehabilitation, but only forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 sec and maximal inspiratory muscle <b>pressure</b> generating <b>capacity</b> further improved thereafter. In particular, expiratory muscle function and subjects with tetraplegia should be screened and trained regularly. © 2008 The Authors.

50|$|To achieve {{improvement}} in PHE's, two important factors namely {{amount of heat}} transfer and pressure drop {{have to be considered}} such that amount of heat transfer needs to be increased and pressure drops need to be decreased. In plate heat exchangers due to presence of corrugated plate, there is a significant resistance to flow with high friction loss. Thus to design plate heat exchangers, one should consider both factors. For various range of Reynolds numbers, many correlations and chevron angles for plate heat exchangers exist. The plate geometry {{is one of the most}} important factor in heat transfer and pressure drop in plate heat exchangers, however such a feature is not accurately prescribed. In the corrugated plate heat exchangers, because of narrow path between the plates, there is a large <b>pressure</b> <b>capacity</b> and the flow becomes turbulent along the path. Therefore, it requires more pumping power than the other types of heat exchangers. Therefore, higher heat transfer and less pressure drop are targeted. The shape of plate heat exchanger is very important for industrial applications that are affected by pressure drop.|$|E

The addition of fibers into a conventional reinforced concrete can improve the structural and functional performance of safety-related concrete structures in nuclear power plants. Methods: The influence of fibers on the ultimate internal <b>pressure</b> <b>capacity</b> of a prestressed concrete containment vessel (PCCV) was investigated through {{a comparison of the}} ultimate pressure capacities between conventional and fiber-reinforced PCCVs. Steel and polyamide fibers were used. The tension behaviors of conventional concrete and fiber-reinforced concrete specimens were investigated through uniaxial tension tests and their tension-stiffening models were obtained. Results: For a PCCV reinforced with 1 % volume hooked-end steel fiber, the ultimate <b>pressure</b> <b>capacity</b> increased by approximately 12 % in comparison with that for a conventional PCCV. For a PCCV reinforced with 1. 5 % volume polyamide fiber, an increase of approximately 3 % was estimated for the ultimate <b>pressure</b> <b>capacity.</b> Conclusion: The ultimate <b>pressure</b> <b>capacity</b> can be greatly improved by introducing steel and polyamide fibers in a conventional reinforced concrete. Steel fibers are more effective at enhancing the containment performance of a PCCV than polyamide fibers.

40|$|In this study, the {{feasibility}} of using a micro LiBr/water-based absorption heat pump system embedded in protective clothing used in hazardous environments is explored and the characteristics of various microelectromechanicals-stem-based components are reviewed. The pump is identified as {{a key part of}} optimizing the performance of the system. An electroosmotic (EO) micro pump is suggested due to its higher flow rate together with many other advantages. A fabrication process of the EO micro pump was developed and various prototypes of the EO pump were fabricated using standard microfabrication technology. Experiments were conducted to study the performance of the EO micro pump. The results show that a thinner pump offers a higher <b>pressure</b> <b>capacity</b> but a lower flow rate. Higher electric field strength results in an enhanced <b>pressure</b> <b>capacity</b> and flow rate. The flow rate increases at higher temperatures. The effect of the ionic concentration on. pumping performance is weak even if the flow rate and <b>pressure</b> <b>capacity</b> are enhanced to some extent. Ethanol was also explored, and it was found that both the flow rate and the pressure are lower when water is used as the working liquid. The information from these results is valuable for use in the subsequent design of the overall micro heat pump system. A thermodynamic analysis using the EO pump information shows that the energy density of the micro heat pump system can be as high as 2. 6 W/g and is feasible for use in protective clothing aiming at a total cooling load of about 300 W. The EO pump has been found to contribute about 45 % of the total mass of the micro heat pump system...|$|E

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to investigate the response of a CANDU® 1 nuclear power plant containment structure to a much higher internal pressure that could be encountered during a severe accident. In this study, for the prestressed containment structure, a detailed model is obtained by a full 3 D model. Nonlinear finite element method is employed to predict the response of the structure using ANSYS software. The major challenges for modelling prestressing tendon elements are to accommodate parameters affecting prestressing forces. In previous research studies, the prestressing system is modelled using an equivalent pressure and tendon end forces, and tendons are modelled as smeared reinforcement in the concrete elements. In this study, the prestressing tendons are modelled using discrete elements. This method enables the capability of the model to update the prestressing forces accommodating the non-uniform losses. The difference in the response of the structure using the discrete model for the prestressing tendons and the smeared approach is 15 percent. It is observed that the containment structure, meets the design requirements of the current standards as it behaves linearly up to 1. 5 times the design pressure, and the ultimate <b>pressure</b> <b>capacity</b> is estimated as 2. 7 times the design pressure.
