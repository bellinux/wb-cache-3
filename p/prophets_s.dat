Islam conveys the message of love, peace and harmony and at the same time admonishes pandemonium, restlessness and chaos in society. Humanity on the globe generally and Muslims specifically are passing through very difficult times. Humanity, now a days is passing through various tensions and threats where bedlam {{is one of the}}m either on individual or collective level or on national and international level. In this difficult time, it necessitates to return and revise the teachings of Holy <b>Prophet</b> (<b>S.</b> A. W) as his (S. A. W) teachings are a blessing, sanctified element and gift from Allah which should be studied, understood and practiced so that we may contribute as an effective part of society. Literal meanings of Islam, Muslim and Momin indicate towards the message of love, peace and harmony. Allah has many names and one among them is “Salam” “Peace”. Being Muslims it is our duty to present the peaceful face of Islam as our <b>prophet</b> (<b>S.</b> A. W) fought for the establishment of peace and discouragement of violence in society. According to various books on the life of the Holy <b>Prophet</b> (<b>S.</b> A. W) such as Rahmat Aalam, Nabi Rehmat, Hadi Azam, Muhammad-e-Arbi one of the major achievements of Holy <b>Prophet</b> (<b>S.</b> A. W) is to establish a pious and complete society based on oneness of Allah and divine laws. The divine law which was given by Allah and implemented by Holy <b>Prophet</b> (<b>S.</b> A. W) was based on love, peace and harmony. Rest of the <b>Prophets</b> (A. <b>S)</b> was sent for the accomplishment of the same mission. They all instituted the serenity in societies of their time and ceased off devastations and pandemonium in humanity. It is observed that world is in search of lost peace which has become a dream of present day’s societies, families, and countries. Even peace has vanished from streets and towns at international and national politics, economy, religiosity, individual and collective levels. All this mess is directing towards restlessness, lack of patience, lack of justice and revenge. Humanity and world can come out of this chaotic situation only by acting upon God Almighty’s divine teachings and practices of Holy <b>Prophet</b> (<b>S.</b> A. W). The present research paper is a drop of the rain that overviews and understands prophetic teachings for chaos and establishment of peace...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{sets out}} to analyze the {{different}} components of the political ideology of the <b>Prophet</b> <b>s</b> Ummah. By analyzing the various texts the group has published online, the videos they have posted, and various other books, research papers and so on, I have explained exactly what the ideological beliefs of the <b>Prophet</b> <b>s</b> Ummah, {{and see how they}} fit in with the historical roots of Islamism, as well as other contemporary groups. The first part of the analysis is of the general theoretical beliefs. The groups of ideas are defined as descriptive of the world, normative as to how the world should be, and method for achieving this. The second part is to uncover which concrete recommendations the group has for the state and society based on the ideas. My main findings are that the <b>Prophet</b> <b>s</b> Ummah is almost a perfect fit {{when it comes to the}} theoretical basis of Islamism. They show almost every indicator when compared to the historical consensus of what Islamism is, and are sufficiently related to the other contemporary groups. The main descriptive beliefs are that they believe that Islam is struck in some form of civilizational struggle with the rest of the world, particularly the West, that this war is both of a physical and ideological nature, and that the influence from outside-sources has weakened and infected the perfect system given to mankind by Allah; Islam. The normative is that all people should follow a specific type of sharia, which is a divine set of rules meant guide both social and political life. Their recommendation is an Islamic State, or a Caliphate, based on these rules. This must be achieved by any means necessary. As such, they defend the use of violence, and adhere to an offensive understanding of jihad. The concrete solutions and recommendations however, are few. My main conclusion is that the <b>Prophet</b> <b>s</b> Ummah is clear on what they perceive to be the problem, but not on how to solve it. The analysis uncovers that apart from the general belief in an Islamic State, there are few coherent proposals on what it would look like, and how it would run...|$|R

"The thing {{began in}} this way: We and the Syrians were {{facing each other}} while we had common faith in one Allah, in the same <b>Prophet</b> (<b>s)</b> and on the same {{principles}} and canons of religion. So far as faith in Allah and the Holy <b>Prophet</b> (<b>s)</b> was concerned we never wanted them (the Syrians) to believe in anything over and above or other than what they were believing in {{and they did not}} want us to change our faith. Both of us were united on these principles. The point of contention between us was the question of the murder of Uthman. It had created the split. They wanted to lay the murder at my door while I am actually innocent of it.I advised them that this problem cannot be solved by excitement. Let the excitement subside, let us cool down; let us do away with sedition and revolt; let the country settle down into a peaceful atmosphere and when once a stable regime is formed and the right authority is accepted, then let this question be dealt with on the principles of equity and justice because only then the authority will have power enough to find the criminals and to bring them to justice. They refused to accept my advice and said that they wanted to decide the issue on the point of the sword.When they thus rejected my proposal of peace and kept on sabre rattling threats, then naturally the battle, which was furious and bloody, started. When they saw defeat facing them across the battlefield, when many of them were killed, and many more wounded, then they went down on their knees and proposed the same thing, which I had proposed before the bloodshed had begun.I accepted their proposal so that their desire might be fulfilled, my intentions of accepting the principles of truth and justice and acting according to these principles might become clear and they might have no cause to complain against me.Now whoever adheres firmly to the promises made will be the one whose salvation will be saved by Allah and one who will try to go back upon the promises made, will fall deeper and deeper into heresy, error and loss.

The preservation of lineage is greatly emphasized by the Islamic Shariah and the Cairo declaration {{of human rights in}} Islam also supported the protection of lineage in Islam.

The aspects covered in the paper range from discussion of right of progeny as well as equal rights of progeny for male and female; rights of children with the hierarchy of their rights from the stage of fetus, having proper nursing, caring, education and a healthy beginning of life. The comparative analysis based on arguments of Shariah and the CDHRI proves that it is the basic objective of Shariah to protect all fundamental rights and right of progeny has the foremost significance in it. ...|$|R

In Islamic teachings, weight and measurement play a significant principle in business transactions which have repeatedly emphasized by the <b>Prophet</b> <b>S.</b> A. W. Riba’ or interest is forbidden in the Quran. Sunnah should be followed. Nevertheless, post-modern business world embraces International Financial Reporting Standards (IRFS) for reporting for which in contrary is insufficient to cover certain elements of Islamic practice. Hence, Shariah compliant companies are torn in between pursuing religion obligations and being internationally acceptance for compliance and reporting. This research has collected evidence from 712 companies listed in Bursa Malaysia under Shariah law, a decree that is enshrined in the Quran. We employed multiple regression method to test the samples. Malaysian capital market is chosen as our research contender due to its position {{as the most important}} Islamic finance center. In effect, even though the main driver for reporting financial statements are IFRS, we found that income recognition in these companies is not significant, an important virtue that is weighty in Shariah companies. There were few studies on Islamic financial institutions that cover different angles of income recognition for other countries. This study focus on the same scenario, yet supplemented with a study on income recognition in Shariah compliant companies in Malaysian capital market...|$|R

It is concerned primarily with the use of specific Hadith text (Jawahir al-Bukhari) as a tool for social teaching in Malaysia. It is an attempt to provide a briefly work on the subject, particularly the role of this text in terms of his transmission of fundamental Islamic principles to Malay Muslims. In the interests of validity and reliability, the study provides multiple sources of evidence. These include tape-recorded indepth interviews 1 with researchers (in particular with an expert educationalist in twentieth century social, political and religious affairs in Malaysia) and academicians who are biographers of Husayn identified. My approach to the text builds also on the employments of the interpretation approach used in the understanding of text. Thus, research methods used to examine the original writings of Husayn are largely ‘qualitative 2, and consist of approaches such as ‘hermeneutics’ and the ‘inferential’ technique of content analysis. This article identifies that in social and religious discourse in Malaysia the use of Hadith texts serves social and political as well as religious practical teaching. It also identifies that the development of the Hadith in Malaysia and its significance for Malay Muslims was signified by several issues raised by Malay religious scholars. This includes the consciousness and critique of Malay Muslims on the misconduct in their lives. Among the purposes of the translation and commentary of Arabic texts are the definitions of an ideal Islamic society and to preserve the Hadith of the <b>Prophet</b> <b>s.</b> a. w to the Malay community.
