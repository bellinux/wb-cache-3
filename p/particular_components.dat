25|$|In 2015, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists {{unveiled}} the , an online tool that estimates {{the full cost}} of electricity produced by three configurations of the nuclear fuel cycle. Two years in the making, this interactive calculator is the first generally accessible model to provide a nuanced look at the economic costs of nuclear power; it lets users test how sensitive the price of electricity is to a full range of components—more than 60 parameters that can be adjusted for the three configurations of the nuclear fuel cycle considered by this tool (once-through, limited-recycle, full-recycle). Users can select the fuel cycle they would like to examine, change cost estimates for each component of that cycle, and even choose uncertainty ranges for the cost of <b>particular</b> <b>components.</b> This approach allows users around the world to compare the cost of different nuclear power approaches in a sophisticated way, while taking account of prices relevant to their own countries or regions.|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{separation}} {{techniques such}} as milling, centrifugation, and pressing have enabled concentration of <b>particular</b> <b>components</b> of food, yielding flour, oils, juices, and so on, and even separate fatty acids, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals. Inevitably, such large-scale concentration changes the nutritional content of food, saving certain nutrients while removing others. Heating techniques may also reduce food's content of many heat-labile nutrients such as certain vitamins and phytochemicals, and possibly other yet-to-be-discovered substances. Because of reduced nutritional value, processed foods are often 'enriched' or 'fortified' {{with some of the}} most critical nutrients (usually certain vitamins) that were lost during processing. Nonetheless, processed foods tend to have an inferior nutritional profile compared to whole, fresh foods, regarding content of both sugar and high GI starches, potassium/sodium, vitamins, fiber, and of intact, unoxidized (essential) fatty acids.

2500|$|There {{have always}} been {{problems}} in getting an understanding of full-scale aircraft behavior from wind tunnel data. Most of these problems arise because small scale models in atmospheric pressure tunnels operate at much lower Reynolds numbers than real aircraft, making the data hard to scale up. [...] In the late 1920s {{there was only one}} tunnel big enough to take full size aircraft propellers, and one which by running at high pressure could reach realistic Reynolds numbers with aircraft models; both of these were recent and in the USA. [...] It is therefore not surprising that some aircraft were designed specifically to undertake aerodynamic studies of <b>particular</b> <b>components.</b> [...] In the UK, the Bristol [...] "Laboratory" [...] was built to study the drag of different cowlings for radial engines and the Parnall Parasol to measure the forces acting on wings of different section in flight.|$|E

Software development tools such as Visual Studio or the numerous coding environments for Java will also allow <b>particular</b> <b>components</b> to be designed entirely in code and then used as building blocks in workflow diagrams after they are compiled.|$|E
50|$|Thermography can be {{classified}} as qualitative or quantitative, and passive or active. Qualitative thermography usually does not require an accurate temperature measurement. It only evaluates temperature differences between <b>particular</b> <b>components,</b> between different spots on the same object or between the measured object and the background. Qualitative thermography has many important applications, for example a thermal leaks diagnostics, thermal components diagnostics, searching for persons or in medicine. In contrast, the goal of quantitative thermography is an accurate temperature measurement of inspected objects. Knowledge of thermo-optical properties of the measured objects is essential in this case. Moreover, the thermo-optical properties often depend on temperature {{and it is also}} necessary to take into account an influence of environment.|$|E

50|$|Recently, it {{has been}} {{observed}} that colonization resistance can occur within the host in a 'direct' or 'indirect' manner. The former refers to <b>particular</b> <b>components</b> of the microbiota directly competing with exogenous pathogens for nutritional niches (e.g. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron directly competes with Citrobacter rodentium for carbohydrates in the intestinal lumen) or by producing growth inhibitors (e.g. Bacteroides thuringiensis can secrete bacteriocin that directly targets spore-forming Clostridium difficile, thus inhibiting its growth through an unknown mechanism), that directly inhibit the colonizing pathogen. Indirect colonization resistance is thought to be mediated through the induction of immune responses in the host that concomitantly inhibit the colonizing pathogen. An example of this has been observed with B. thetaiotaomicron, which can induce the host to produce antimicrobial C-type lectins REGIIIγ and REGIIIβ, both anti-microbial peptides that target gram-positive bacteria.|$|E
