Using a Sindbis virus expression vector, {{we showed that}} cytoplasmic synthesis of the <b>pregenome</b> resulted in hepadnaviral DNA synthesis. Moreover, complete infectious virus was produced from cells transfected with hepadnaviral pregenomic RNA. We conclude that the <b>pregenome</b> of hepadnaviruses can express all the proteins required for DNA synthesis as well as serve as a template for reverse transcription and that DNA resulting from <b>pregenome</b> expression can be utilized to establish a productive infection in pregenome-transfected cells...|$|E

The {{expression of the}} capsid protein C, together with envelope proteins {{in the absence of}} pregenomic RNA, produced normal amounts of intracellular capsids, but the secretion of virion-like particles was greatly reduced. The I 97 L C protein mutant, allowing immature nucleocapsid envelopment in the background of an HBV genome, did not promote the envelopment of capsids lacking a <b>pregenome,</b> suggesting that this mutation is not sufficient to induce secretion competence independently of the <b>pregenome...</b>|$|E
40|$|Evidence is {{presented}} that the previously cloned type I duck interferon (DuIFN) cDNA encodes a homologue of mammalian interferon-alpha (IFN-α). Recombinant DuIFN-α {{was used to}} study the inhibition of duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) replication in primary hepatocytes {{in order to determine}} the IFN-sensitive steps of the virus replication cycle. IFN-treated cells accumulated two- to threefold-lower amounts of viral RNA transcripts early during infection, when IFN was added before virus. This reduction was not due to inhibition of virus entry since initial covalently closed circular DNA levels were not decreased in IFN-treated cells. Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of IFN on viral RNA levels was not observed in cells infected with a mutant DHBV that fails to synthesize core protein, suggesting that an uncharacterized core protein-mediated enhancing effect is blocked by IFN. When IFN was added at 4 days postinfection, encapsidated viral RNA <b>pregenomes</b> disappeared from infected cells within 3 days. This depletion was not simply due to conversion of <b>pregenomes</b> to DNA since depletion was not blocked by phosphonoformic acid, an inhibitor of the viral reverse transcriptase. The intracellular concentration of intact nucleocapsids was reduced, suggesting that in the presence of IFN pregenome-containing capsids were selectively depleted in hepatocytes. Thus, two steps in DHBV replication that involve the viral core protein were inhibited by DuIFN-α...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDefective {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) genomes {{derived from}} packaging and reverse transcription of spliced RNA <b>pregenomes</b> {{were reported to}} be associated with progression to chronic infection. Since only two types with similarly spliced regions were characterized so far we reasoned that additional “spliced” genome variants may exist. Therefore, we isolated a large number of defective HBV genomes from sera of seven chronic carriers by full-length PCR. Forty-eight were found to contain deletions caused by splicing as identified by cloning, subgenomic PCR, and sequencing. In total, 11 types of spliced genomes derived from excision of 10 different introns were present in various combinations in each serum. This diversity resulted from alternative usage of five splice donor and four acceptor sites present in most but not all HBV genotypes. All spliced genomes shared sequence elements essential for replication as well as for transcription of the pre-C and pregenome/C mRNAs and the X mRNA. Moreover, all contained the coding regions for the X protein and for precore/core or precore/core fusion proteins but lacked the pre-S/S gene promoters. These data demonstrate substantial and HBV genotype-dependent diversity of spliced genomes from which a variety of aberrant precore/core fusion proteins and normal X protein but no functional envelope and P proteins could be expressed. These genomes and the encoded proteins {{may play a role in}} the viral life cycle, persistence, and pathogenesis...|$|R
40|$|The {{selective}} encapsidation of the hepadnaviral RNA <b>pregenome</b> from {{an excess}} of other viral and cellular mRNAs predicts specific protein-RNA interactions involving one or several sites on the <b>pregenome.</b> Using deletion analysis in a transient expression/packaging system in which all relevant viral proteins are provided in trans from a packaging-deficient helper genome, we identified near the 5 '-end of the <b>pregenome</b> a 137 nucleotide sequence that is necessary and sufficient for RNA encapsidation; {{other parts of the}} 3 kb <b>pregenome</b> were found not to contribute to this process. The encapsidation sequence, which we call epsilon, possesses several interesting features with implications for the pregenome's function in RNA packaging, RNA translation and reverse transcription. (i) epsilon contains several indirect repeat sequences, suggesting a high degree of secondary structure, (ii) epsilon overlaps with the start signal for core gene translation, suggesting a mechanism to regulate the alternative use of the <b>pregenome</b> as core mRNA, (iii) epsilon does not contain the direct repeat sequences known {{to be involved in the}} initiation of viral DNA synthesis. Finally, our deletion analysis suggests that ribosomes translating the epsilon sequence from the precore start codon may interfere with genomic RNA packaging...|$|E
40|$|We {{have found}} that {{transcription}} of the <b>pregenome</b> of an avian hepadnavirus, duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV), {{is dependent on the}} presence of a small element in the 5 ' transcribed region of the pregenome-encoding sequence. This element, which we have named pet (positive effector of transcription), exerts its effect in cis in a position and orientation-dependent manner, suggesting that it may function as part of the nascent <b>pregenome</b> transcript. The requirement for pet depends on the presence in the transcription unit of a region of the DHBV genome located upstream of the envelope promoters, which specifically suppresses transcription of templates lacking pet. In the presence of this region, deletion of pet activates transcription from downstream promoters, suggesting that <b>pregenome</b> transcription complexes fail to reach the downstream promoters. In vitro transcription experiments support the model that pet is required for transcription elongation on the DHBV template. We speculate that pet is required to suppress transcription termination during the first passage of <b>pregenome</b> transcription complexes through a viral termination region on the circular viral DNA...|$|E
40|$|We have {{constructed}} {{a series of}} deletion mutants spanning the genome of duck hepatitis B virus {{in order to determine}} which regions of the viral genome are required in cis for packaging of the <b>pregenome</b> into capsid particles. Deletion of sequences within either of two nonadjacent regions prevented replication of the mutant viral genomes expressed in a permissive avian hepatoma cell line in the presence of functionally active viral core and P proteins. Extraction of RNA from cells transfected with these replication-defective mutants showed that the mutants retained the capacity to be transcribed into a pregenomic-size viral RNA, but that these RNA species were not packaged into viral capsids. The two regions defined by these deletions are located 36 to 126 (region I) and 1046 to 1214 (region II) nucleotides downstream of the 5 ' end of the <b>pregenome</b> and contain sequences which are required in cis for encapsidation of the duck hepatitis B virus <b>pregenome...</b>|$|E

The observed mutational profiles {{were consistent with the}} presence of a base-paired region of the <b>pregenome</b> encapsidation signal overlapping the HBe-coding sequence.

40|$|International audienceHepatitis B virus (HBV) is an {{important}} human pathogen, which targets the liver extremely efficient, gaining access to hepatocytes by a so far unknown receptor and replicating in a hepatocyte-specific fashion. Cell differentiation seems to determine HBV replication. We here show {{that the level of}} hepatocyte differentiation, as indicated by hepatocyte polarization and metabolic activity, is closely correlated to the transcription of the HBV RNA <b>pregenome.</b> <b>Pregenome</b> transcription determined the level of HBV replication in various cell lines of hepatocellular origin and in primary human hepatocytes. A variety of hepatocyte-enriched nuclear factors have been described to regulate transcription of the <b>pregenome,</b> but it remained unknown which factors link HBV replication to hepatocyte differentiation. We determined that high expression levels of HNF 4 alpha but not its potential cofactors or other hepatocyte-enriched transcription factors were essential for efficient HBV replication, and link it to hepatocyte differentiation. HNF 1 alpha contributed to the control of HBV replication because it regulated the expression of HNF 4 alpha. Thus, a concerted action of HNF 4 alpha and HNF 1 alpha, which also determines morphological and functional differentiation of hepatocytes, links HBV replication to hepatocyte differentiation...|$|E
40|$|To {{study the}} {{replication}} {{strategy of the}} human hepatitis B virus, the 5 ' end of the RNA <b>pregenome</b> and the initiation sites of DNA plus and minus strands have been mapped. The RNA <b>pregenome</b> {{was found to be}} terminally redundant by 120 nucleotides; it is initiated within the pre-C region and may also function as mRNA for synthesis of the major core protein and the hepatitis B virus reverse transcriptase. The hepatitis B virus DNA minus strand is initiated within the direct repeat sequence DR 1, it contains a terminal redundancy of up to eight nucleotides, and its synthesis does not require any template switch. The DNA plus strand is primed by a short oligoribonucleotide probably derived from the 5 ' end of the RNA <b>pregenome,</b> and its synthesis is initiated close to the direct repeat sequence DR 2. For its elongation to pass the discontinuity in the DNA minus strand an intramolecular template switch occurs using the terminal redundancy of this template. Thus, the route of reverse transcription and DNA replication of hepatitis B viruses is fundamentally different from that of retroviruses...|$|E
40|$|Hepadnaviruses {{replicate}} through {{reverse transcription}} of an RNA <b>pregenome,</b> {{resulting in a}} relaxed circular DNA genome. The first 3 or 4 nucleotides (nt) of minus-strand DNA are synthesized {{by the use of}} a bulge in a stem-loop structure near the 5 ′ end of the <b>pregenome</b> as a template. This primer is then transferred to a complementary UUCA motif, termed an acceptor, within DR 1 * near the 3 ′ end of the viral <b>pregenome</b> via 4 -nt homology, and it resumes minus-strand DNA synthesis: this process is termed minus-strand transfer or primer translocation. Aside from the sequence identity of the donor and acceptor, {{little is known about the}} sequence elements contributing to minus-strand transfer. Here we report a novel cis-acting element, termed the β 5 region (28 nt in length), located 20 nt upstream of DR 1 *, that facilitates minus-strand DNA synthesis. The deletion or inversion of the sequence including the β 5 region diminished minus-strand DNA synthesis initiated at DR 1 *. Furthermore, the insertion of the β 5 region into its own position in a mutant in which the sequences including the β 5 region were replaced restored minus-strand DNA synthesis at DR 1 *. We speculate that the β 5 region facilitates minus-strand transfer, possibly by bringing the acceptor site in proximity to the donor site via base pairing or by interacting with protein factors involved in this process...|$|E
40|$|The {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) P gene which encodes {{the reverse}} transcriptase and other proteins required for replication is expressed on the bicistronic mRNA <b>pregenome</b> which also encodes the capsid protein {{in its first}} cistron. Recent results {{have suggested that the}} hepadnaviral P gene is translated by internal entry of ribosomes upstream from the P gene, in the overlapping C gene. Using a reporter gene fused to the HBV C or P gene, we demonstrate that the C sequence does not allow internal initiation of translation. Alternatively, our results support a model in which the HBV P gene is translated by ribosomes which scan from the capped extremity of the bicistronic mRNA <b>pregenome.</b> The mechanism by which the ribosomes scan past four AUGs before they initiate translation at the P AUG was analyzed. Our results show that these AUGs are skipped via two mechanisms: leaky scanning on AUGs in a weak or suboptimal initiation context and translation of an out-of-C-frame minicistron followed by reinitiation at P AUG. The minicistron translation allows ribosomes to bypass an AUG in a favorable context that would otherwise be used as a start codon for translation of a truncated capsid protein. Our results suggest that this elaborated scanning mechanism permits the coordinate expression of the HBV C and P genes on the viral bicistronic mRNA <b>pregenome.</b> The hepadnaviruses are a group of enveloped DNA vi-ruses which replicate their genome by reverse transcriptio...|$|E
40|$|The {{plus strand}} of virion DNA of duck {{hepatitis}} B virus possessed, at its 5 ' terminus, a capped oligoribonucleotide 18 to 19 bases in length. This oligoribonucleotide had a unique 5 ' end, the heterogeneity in length reflecting two distinct junctions with plus-strand DNA that were 1 base apart. The {{sequence of the}} RNA differed from that predicted by the sequence of duck hepatitis B virus upstream of the 5 ' ends of plus-strand DNA but was identical to a downstream sequence corresponding to the 5 ' terminus of a major poly(A) + viral RNA mapped by Büscher and co-workers (Cell 40 : 717 - 724, 1985). This RNA transcript is thought {{to serve as the}} template (i. e., the <b>pregenome)</b> for minus-strand synthesis via reverse transcription.

40|$|The human {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) is a hepatotropic {{virus that}} replicates through an RNA intermediate {{referred to as}} the <b>pregenome.</b> The promoter that directs the synthesis of the <b>pregenome</b> and several other transcripts with heterogeneous 5 ' ends is of particular interest because of its role in regulating key functions during the viral life cycle. We have examined the liver-specific characteristics of this promoter by DNA-protein interactions and by demonstrating the in vivo function of the promoter using the luciferase reporter gene expression system. The DNA-protein interactions in this region appear to be almost entirely liver-specific. Among these, a liver-specific nuclear factor, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein, binds to at least five sites on this promoter. Transient cotransfection experiments using CCAAT/enhancer binding protein expression vectors and the core promoter in the context of either the native hepatitis B virus genome or the luciferase reporter gene demonstrate that CCAAT/enhancer binding protein at low concentration modestly activates expression from the core promoter but represses at high concentration...|$|E
40|$|Encapsidation of the pregenomic RNA into nucleocapsids is a {{selective}} process which depends on specific RNA-protein interactions. The signal {{involved in the}} packaging of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) RNA <b>pregenome</b> was recently defined as a short sequence located near the 5 ' end of that molecule (Junker-Niepmann et al., EMBO J., in press), but it remained an open question which viral proteins are required. Using a genetic approach, we analyzed whether proteins derived from the HBV P gene {{play an important role}} in <b>pregenome</b> encapsidation. The results obtained with point mutations, deletions, and insertions scattered throughout the P gene clearly demonstrate that (i) a P gene product containing all functional domains is required both for the encapsidation of HBV pregenomic RNA and for packaging of nonviral RNAs fused to the HBV encapsidation signal, (ii) known enzymatic activities are not involved in the packaging reaction, suggesting that P protein is required as a structural component, and (iii) P protein acts primarily in cis, i. e., pregenomic RNAs from which P protein is synthesized are preferentially encapsidated...|$|E
40|$|Assembly of replication-competent {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) nucleocapsids {{requires the}} interaction of the core protein, the P protein, and the RNA <b>pregenome.</b> The core protein contains an arginine-rich C-terminal domain which is dispensable for particle formation in heterologous expression systems. Using transient expression in HuH 7 cells of a series of C-terminally truncated core proteins, I examined the functional role of this basic region {{in the context of a}} complete HBV genome. All variants containing at least the 144 N-terminal amino acids were assembly competent, but efficient <b>pregenome</b> encapsidation was observed only with variants consisting of 164 or more amino acids. These data indicate that one function of the arginine-rich region is to provide the interactions between core protein and RNA <b>pregenome.</b> However, in cores from the variant ending with amino acid 164, the production of complete positive-strand DNA was drastically reduced. Moreover, almost all positive-strand DNA originated from in situ priming, whereas in wild-type particles, this type of priming not supporting the formation of relaxed circular DNA (RC-DNA) accounted for about one half of the positive strands. Further C-terminal residues to position 173 restored RC-DNA formation, and the corresponding variant did not differ from the full-length core protein in all assays used. The observation that RNA encapsidation and formation of RC-DNA can be genetically separated suggests that the core protein, via its basic C-terminal region, also acts as an essential auxiliary component in HBV replication, possibly like a histone, or like a single-stranded-DNA-binding protein. In contrast to their importance for HBV replication, sequences beyond amino acid 164 were not required for the formation of enveloped virions. Since particles from variant 164 did not contain mature DNA genomes, a genome maturation signal is apparently not required for HBV nucleocapsid envelopment...|$|E
40|$|We {{characterized}} {{a number}} of important features {{of the structure of the}} cohesive overlap region of the DNA genome of duck hepatitis B virus. The 5 '-terminal nucleotide of minus-strand DNA was localized to nucleotide 2537, a G residue within the 12 -base repeat sequence DR 1. This G residue was shown to be the site of a covalent linkage to a protein, consistent with speculation that this protein is the primer of minus-strand synthesis, which occurs by reverse transcription. The 3 ' terminus of the minus strand was heterogeneous, being mapped to nucleotides 2530 and 2531, indicating that the minus strand is terminally redundant by seven or eight bases and ends at the putative 5 ' end of the transcribed RNA template (<b>pregenome)</b> for reverse transcription. We previously demonstrated that the presumptive RNA primer of plus-strand synthesis remains attached to plus-strand DNA during virus maturation; moreover, the sequence of this primer suggested an origin from the 5 ' end of the <b>pregenome</b> (J. -M. Lien, C. E. Aldrich, and W. S. Mason, J. Virol. 57 : 229 - 236, 1986). We show here that over 75 % of plus-strand primers are capped, further supporting the idea that these primers are uniquely derived from the 5 ' end of the <b>pregenome.</b> Finally, we found that seemingly mature duck hepatitis B virus genomes are incomplete by at least 12 bases, in that the 12 -base repeat sequence DR 2 is not copied into plus-strand DNA during virus maturation. Since DR 2 in virion DNA is duplexed with the RNA primer of plus-strand synthesis, it is possible that the failure to make complete plus strands is due to an inability of the viral DNA polymerase to carry out a displacement of the bound RNA primer...|$|E
40|$|Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA clones were {{propagated}} from 57 carriers with antibody to hepatitis B {{e antigen}} (HBeAg) and sequenced within nucleotides (nt) 1685 to 1926 including the core promoter (nt 1742 to 1849) and the pre-C region (nt 1814 to 1900). Mutations {{in the core}} promoter or those in the pre-C region, or both, were detected in 328 (97. 9 %) of 335 clones from them. Five carriers were infected with HBV mutants with mutations in the core promoter alone, while 20 carriers were infected only {{with those in the}} pre-C region to abort the translation of HBeAg precursor; the remaining 32 carriers were infected with HBV mutants with mutations in both the core promoter and pre-C region. Some carriers infected with HBV with mutations in the core promoter exclusively had high HBV DNA titers, comparable with those in carriers infected with wild-type HBV, thereby indicating that such mutations would not affect the transcription of the HBV <b>pregenome</b> extensively. Two point mutations in the core promoter, from A to T at nt 1762 and from G to A at nt 1764, were most prevalent. The other mutations included a point mutation at either of the two nucleotides and their deletion. All of these mutations involved the TTAAA sequence (nt 1758 to 1762) at 28 bp upstream of the initiation site for shorter pre-C mRNAs (nt 1790 +/- 1). The ATAAATT sequence (nt 1789 to 1795) at 23 bp upstream of the initiation site for the <b>pregenome</b> RNA (nt 1818), however, remained intact in all 335 HBV DNA clones. HBV mutants with mutations in the core promoter, unaccompanied by pre-C mutations, prevailed and replaced wild-type HBV in two carriers as they seroconverted from HBeAg to the corresponding antibody. These results indicate that HBV mutants with an HBeAg- phenotype would be generated by mutations in the core promoter which might abort the transcription of pre-C mRNA but do not seriously affect that of <b>pregenome</b> RNA...|$|E
40|$|Assembly of the enveloped {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) is {{initiated by}} packaging of the RNA <b>pregenome</b> and the viral reverse transcriptase-DNA polymerase into a nucleocapsid. The <b>pregenome</b> is then reverse transcribed into single-stranded minus-polarity DNA, which is subsequently replicated to double-stranded DNA. All replicative intermediates are observable in capsids within infected liver, but only relatively mature nucleocapsids containing partially double stranded DNA {{are found in}} secreted virions. This observation suggests that maturation of the genome within the capsid is required for envelopment and secretion. We show that the differential distribution of replicative intermediates between intracellular nucleocapsids and secreted virions is also observable in human hepatoma cells transfected with wild-type HBV genomes. However, nucleocapsids were not enveloped or secreted when they were produced by an HBV genome carrying a missense mutation in the DNA polymerase that eliminates all DNA synthesis. An HBV missense mutant defective in the RNase H activity of the polymerase which allowed minus-strand DNA synthesis but not formation of double-stranded DNA was able to form virion-like particles. These experiments demonstrate that immature nucleocapsids containing pregenomic RNA are incompetent for envelopment and that minus-strand DNA synthesis in the interior lumen of the capsid is coupled to {{the appearance of a}} signal on the exterior of the nucleocapsid that is essential for its envelopment...|$|E
40|$|The {{replication}} of the hepadnavirus DNA genome is initiated by reverse transcription of <b>pregenome</b> RNA into minus-strand DNA followed by plus-strand DNA synthesis. The priming of plus-strand DNA requires {{the transfer of}} an RNA primer from <b>pregenome</b> RNA to the primer-binding site on minus-strand DNA. Annealing of the primer to the primer-binding site is facilitated by short direct repeats, DR 1 and DR 2. To investigate the mechanism of plus-strand primer formation, we have introduced specific mutations into DR 1 and DR 2 and measured {{the effect of these}} mutants on initiation of plus-strand DNA synthesis. To facilitate such an analysis, we have constructed a vector for the efficient expression of woodchuck hepatitis virus in cultured cells. Our results suggest that the 3 ' end of the RNA primer is determined prior to its transfer to the primer-binding site and that the determination of the 3 ' end of the primer does not depend on a specific sequence motif at the cleavage site. In addition, we have identified an alternative initiation site for plus-strand DNA synthesis at a purine-rich sequence between DR 1 and DR 2. Initiation at this site occurs by a mechanism that is independent of the direct repeats and does not require the transfer of an RNA primer to the primer-binding site...|$|E

40|$|Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is {{the type}} member of the hepadnaviridae, small enveloped DNA viruses that {{replicate}} through reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate, the <b>pregenome.</b> This reaction occurs usually inside the viral nucleocapsid, the assembly of which requires specific interactions between multiple copies of the core protein, the viral replication enzyme (P protein) and the RNA <b>pregenome</b> which also serves as mRNA for both proteins. Deletion studies have established that specific packaging of the RNA is mediated by a short cis-acting sequence, the encapsidation signal epsilon. Using nuclease sensitivity experiments we provide experimental evidence that part of this sequence can adopt a stem-loop structure that is interrupted by a bulge and a single unpaired U residue. The structural consequences of deletions of the unpaired regions and changes in their primary sequences were investigated in vitro, and their influence on {{the function of the}} epsilon-signal was tested in animal cells by monitoring encapsidation of RNAs carrying the mutant epsilon-sequences in front of a 2. 7 kb foreign RNA fragment, or {{within the context of a}} complete HBV genome. The data indicate that the entire stem-loop structure containing the bulge and the loop is critical for encapsidation competence.

40|$|Hepatitis B virus (HBV), the causative {{agent of}} B-type {{hepatitis}} in man, {{is a small}} enveloped DNA virus that replicates through reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate, the terminally redundant RNA <b>pregenome.</b> An essential highly conserved cis-element present twice on this RNA is the encapsidation signal epsilon, a stem-loop structure that is critical for <b>pregenome</b> packaging and reverse transcription. Epsilon is hence an attractive target for antiviral therapy. Its structure, however, is a potential obstacle to antivirals whose action depends on hybridization, e. g. ribozymes. Here we demonstrate effective in vitro cleavage inside epsilon by hammerhead ribozymes containing flanking sequences complementary to an adjacent less structured region. Upon co-transfection with a HBV expression construct corresponding ribozymes embedded in a U 6 snRNA context led to a significant, though modest, reduction in the steady-state level of HBV pregenomes. Inactive ribozyme mutants revealed that antisense effects contributed substantially to this reduction, however, efficient epsilon cleavage by the intracellularly expressed ribozymes was observed in Mg(2 +) -supplemented cell lysates. Artificial HBV pregenomes carrying the ribozymes in cis and model RNAs lacking all HBV sequences except epsilon exhibited essentially the same behaviour. Hence, neither the absence of co-localization of ribozyme and target nor a viral component, but rather a cellular factor(s), {{is responsible for the}} strikingly different ribozyme activities inside cells and in cellular extracts...|$|E

Replication of the viral genome occurs via an RNA <b>pregenome</b> (pgRNA) that binds to HBV polymerase (P). P initiates pgRNA encapsidation and reverse transcription inside the capsid.

The arginine-rich C terminus of the core protein plays {{an essential role in}} both of these steps while being dispensable for nucleocapsid formation. In an attempt to identify other functional domains of the core protein, we performed a series of trans-complementation experiments analyzing the ability of duck and human hepatitis B virus (DHBV and HBV) core protein subunits to support the replication of a core-defective DHBV genome. Plasmids expressing the N-terminal amino acids 1 to 67 or the remaining C-terminal portion, amino acids 67 to 262, of the DHBV core protein were cotransfected into LMH cells along with a replication-deficient construct coding for the DHBV <b>pregenome</b> and polymerase. Neither the N nor the C terminus alone yielded replication-competent core particles. However, cotransfection of plasmids that separately expressed both regions restored a normal replication pattern. Furthermore, the DHBV C terminus but not the N terminus could be replaced by the corresponding domain of the HBV core protein in this assay. Finally, coexpression of the complete HBV core protein and the N terminus from DHBV resulted in DHBV replication, while the HBV core protein alone was not functional. Taken together, these findings suggest a modular organization of the DHBV core protein in which the C terminus is functionally conserved among different hepadnaviruses...|$|E
40|$|Hepatitis B virus (HBV) {{enhancer}} II (EnII) is a hepatotropic cis element {{which is}} responsible for the hepatocyte-specific gene expression of HBV. Multiple transcription factors have been demonstrated to interact with this region. In this study, the region from HBV nucleotides (nt) 1640 to 1663 in EnII was demonstrated to be essential for enhancer activity and to be another target sequence of putative transcription factors. To elucidate the factors which bind to this region, we used a yeast one-hybrid screening system and cloned three transcription factors, HLF, FTF, and E 4 BP 4, from a human adult liver cDNA library. All of these factors had binding affinity to the sequence from nt 1640 to 1663. Investigation of the effects of these factors on transcriptional regulation revealed that HLF and FTF had stimulatory activity on nt 1640 to 1663, whereas E 4 BP 4 had a suppressing effect. FTF coordinately activated both 3. 5 -kb RNA and 2. 4 / 2. 1 -kb RNA transcription in a transient transfection assay with an HBV expression vector. HLF, however, activated only 3. 5 -kb RNA transcription, and in primer extension analysis, HLF strongly stimulated the synthesis of <b>pregenome</b> RNA compared to precore RNA. Thus, FTF stimulated the activity of the second enhancer, while HLF stimulated the activity of the core upstream regulatory sequence, which affects only the core promoter, and had a dominant effect on the <b>pregenome</b> RNA synthesis...|$|E

40|$|Replication of the {{hepadnavirus}} genome occurs by {{reverse transcription}} of an RNA <b>pregenome</b> and is {{mediated by the}} viral polymerase; the polymerase is also required for packaging of the <b>pregenome</b> through interaction with the RNA packaging signal, e. Previous work suggested that reverse transcription of minus-strand DNA initiates within the sequence element DR 1 (direct repeat 1) and that disruption of DR 1 activates a cryptic initiation site in a downstream copy of £. However, using active duck hepatitis B virus polymerase expressed in a yeast Ty vector system, we demonstrate that synthesis of minus-strand DNAs with 5 ' ends at DR 1 requires the stem-loop of £, whereas the production of DNAs mapping to E does not require DR 1. Mutations at £ that remove homology between £ and DR 1 eliminate reverse transcripts with 5 ' ends in DR 1, and restoring homology at DRI to a mutant £ partially restores DNAs mapping to DR 1. Insertions of one nucleotide into the bulge region of the £ stem-loop increase the length of minus-strand DNA whose 5 ' ends map to DRI by one nucleotide. Thus, very short minus-strand primers are initiated within E, rather than in DR 1 as previously supposed; they are then transferred to a four-nucleotide homology in DR 1. Transfer was also observed in vivo during replication of duck hepatitis B virus in avian cells; in this case, transfer is from the 5 ' copy of £ to the 3 ' copy of DR 1. This minus-strand transfer reaction {{is likely to be}} a general feature of all hepadnaviruses...|$|E
40|$|The DNA genome of a {{hepatitis}} B {{virus is}} generated by reverse transcription of the RNA <b>pregenome.</b> Replication initiation does not involve a nucleic acid primer; instead, the hepadnavirus P protein binds to the structured RNA encapsidation signal ɛ, from which it copies a short DNA primer that becomes covalently linked to the enzyme. Using in vitro-translated duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) P protein, we probed the secondary structure of the protein-bound DHBV ɛ RNA (Dɛ) and observed a marked conformational change compared to free Dɛ RNA. Several initiation-competent mutant RNAs with a different free-state structure were similarly altered, whereas a binding-competent but initiation-deficient variant was not, indicating {{the importance of the}} rearrangement for replication initiation and suggesting a mechanistic coupling to encapsidation...|$|E
40|$|Human {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) {{is a small}} DNA {{virus that}} replicates inside the viral nucleocapsid by reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate, the <b>pregenome.</b> The sequences encompassing the encapsidation signal epsilon and the direct repeat DR 1 are present in two copies of this terminally redundant transcript. We have recently shown that HBV minus-strand DNA synthesis involves transfer of a short DNA primer copied from 5 '-epsilon to 3 '-DR 1 (DR 1 *). Using transfection of HBV genomes with lesions in 3 '-epsilon, and 5 '-DR 1 and its preceding sequence, we tested whether these additional elements contribute to the specificity of the transfer reaction. However, while some mutations affected proper plus-strand DNA formation, 5 '-epsilon and DR 1 * were completely sufficient for correct minus-strand DNA production...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{interferon}} (IFN) on hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication {{was investigated in}} a stable expression system, using HepG 2 cells transfected with recombinant HBV DNA. IFN was found to cause a marked reduction in the levels of both minus and plus strands of HBV DNA from core particles in the cytoplasm. Neither HBV DNA from virus particles nor the HBV surface antigen in the culture medium primarily underwent change in quantity by treatment with IFN, as was also found for HBV mRNAs and the HBV core antigen/HBV e antigen in the cytoplasm. IFN exerted no influence on HBV DNA synthesis by endogenous DNA polymerase in the core particle fraction. From these findings, {{it would appear that}} IFN inhibits HBV replication by blocking some step in the <b>pregenome</b> RNA-primed assembly of core particles...|$|E
40|$|AbstractHuman {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) is {{the prototype}} {{of a family of}} small DNA viruses that productively infect hepatocytes, the major cell of the liver, and replicate by reverse transcription of a terminally redundant viral RNA, the <b>pregenome.</b> Upon infection, the circular, partially double-stranded virion DNA is converted in the nucleus to a covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) that assembles into a minichromosome, the template for viral mRNA synthesis. Infection of hepatocytes is non-cytopathic. Infection of the liver may be either transient (< 6 months) or chronic and lifelong, depending on the ability of the host immune response to clear the infection. Chronic infections can cause immune-mediated liver damage progressing to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The mechanisms of carcinogenesis are unclear. Antiviral therapies with nucleoside analog inhibitors of viral DNA synthesis delay sequelae, but cannot cure HBV infections due to the persistence of cccDNA in hepatocytes...|$|E
40|$|According to {{the current}} model of {{hepadnavirus}} gene expression, the viral envelope proteins are produced from unspliced subgenomic RNAs, {{in contrast to the}} retroviral mechanism, where the subgenomic env RNA is generated by RNA splicing. We now describe and characterize a novel duck hepatitis B virus RNA species which is derived from the RNA <b>pregenome</b> by loss of a 1. 15 kb intron. This RNA (termed spliced L RNA) codes for the large surface protein (L protein), as does the previously described unspliced mRNA (the preS RNA); however, it differs in 5 ' leader sequence and promoter control. Mutational analysis indicates that the spliced L RNA is functionally important for virus replication in infected hepatocytes and ducks, but not for virus formation from transfected DNA genomes. This suggests that the newly discovered second pathway for L protein synthesis plays a distinct role in an early step in the viral life cycle...|$|E
