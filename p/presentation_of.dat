5|$|A {{coronation}} is the act {{of placement}} or bestowal of a crown upon a monarch's head. The term generally also refers {{not only to the}} physical crowning but to the whole ceremony wherein {{the act of}} crowning occurs, along with the <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> other items of regalia, marking the formal investiture of a monarch with regal power. Aside from the crowning, a coronation ceremony may comprise many other rituals such as the taking of special vows by the monarch, the investing and <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> regalia to the monarch, and acts of homage by the new ruler's subjects and the performance of other ritual deeds of special significance to the particular nation. Western-style coronations have often included anointing the monarch with holy oil, or chrism as it is often called; the anointing ritual's religious significance follows examples found in the Bible. The monarch's consort may also be crowned, either simultaneously with the monarch or as a separate event.|$|E
