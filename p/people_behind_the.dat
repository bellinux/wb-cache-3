5|$|Polygon is an American {{video game}} website that publishes news, culture, reviews, and videos. At its October 2012 launch as Vox Media's third property, Polygon sought to {{distinguish}} itself from competitors {{by focusing on}} the stories of the <b>people</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> games instead of the games themselves. They also produced long-form magazine-style feature articles, invested in video content, and chose to let their review scores be updated as the game changed.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of this}} Popular Revolution, Gaddafi invited Libya's {{people to}} found General People's Committees as {{conduits}} for raising political consciousness. Although offering little guidance for {{how to set up}} these councils, Gaddafi claimed that they would offer a form of direct political participation that was more democratic than a traditional party-based representative system. He hoped that the councils would mobilise the <b>people</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> RCC, erode the power of the traditional leaders and the bureaucracy, and allow for a new legal system chosen by the people. Many such committees were established in schools and colleges, where they were responsible for vetting staff, courses, and textbooks to determine if they were compatible with the country's revolutionary ideology.|$|E
5|$|Ibrox Park, as it {{was known}} between 1899 and 1997, is almost {{completely}} different from the Ibrox Stadium of today. It followed the model of most Scottish stadiums of the time, comprising an oval track around the pitch, with a pavilion and one stand along one side. The ground had a capacity of 40,000. Celtic Park, Ibrox and Hampden Park all competed {{with each other to}} host Scottish Cup Finals and Scotland matches, one of which could generate up to £1,000 in revenue for the host club. To aid their chances of gaining that revenue, Rangers constructed a large terracing, holding 36,000 <b>people,</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> western goalmouth. The terracing, designed by Archibald Leitch, was formed by wooden planks bolted onto a framework made of iron. A similar wooden terracing was constructed at the eastern end, giving a total capacity of 75,000.|$|E

25|$|Relationships {{in virtual}} worlds have an added {{dimension}} {{compared to other}} social media, because avatars give a feeling of proximity making the voyeur experience more intense than simply a textual encounter. The complexities of those encounters depend on the engagement levels of the <b>people</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> avatars, whether they are engaging Disassociatively (entertainment only), Immersively (as if the avatar was them), or Augmentatively (meaning they engage for a real life purpose).|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the leading}} <b>people</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> popular {{movements}} in Östersund saw industrialization as a significant threat towards the native districts and the old village and farmer community. The work from the movements made {{the city and its}} centre-right governance extremely rejective towards industries. Instead they wanted to portray Östersund as a centre of out-door activities, culture, education and tourism. Industries were not allowed to threaten the good environment, and the social history traditions.|$|E

25|$|Researchers {{have noted}} some peculiarities in the mummification process {{used on the}} Lady. The {{evisceration}} {{of the body and}} the stuffing of the torso with embalming materials were standard parts of the mummification process used during the entire reign of the 18th dynasty. This was not the case with the intact skull base and lack of effort to remove the brain, seen {{in the case of the}} Lady. This process had been used on early rulers of the 18th dynasty, as seen in the mummies currently identified with Thutmose I, Thutmose II, and Thutmose III. By the time of the later rulers of the 18th dynasty, when the Lady lived and died, the process had changed. All mummies from this later era contain some treatment of the brain, in attempts to remove it from the body. The mummification process used on the Lady seems like a throwback to an earlier era. Another peculiarity is the evidence that the <b>people</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> mummification process were trying to repair and cover injured areas of the body. They used subcutaneous fillings and packs to remodel the injured left side of the face, the contralateral side of the face, and the right hip region. This was not part of the regular efforts of an embalmer.|$|E

500|$|Over {{the course}} of a year, four more pamphlets, filled with invective and {{complaints}} against both Wood and his patent, followed the first. The pamphlet was successful, and public opinion became so hostile against Wood's coinage that the patent was withdrawn by 1725. At one point, Lord Carteret and the Irish Privy Council offered a significant reward of £300 for information that would verify the identity of the pamphlet's author, but Swift was neither arrested nor charged for the works. The lack of an arrest and the unity of the Irish <b>people</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Drapier" [...] was an important motivating factor behind Walpole's withdrawal of the patent.|$|E
500|$|Many non-Sinclair {{peripherals}} {{aimed to}} remedy the ZX81's flaws and provide many new capabilities. These included RAM packs providing up to 64KB of extra memory and promising to [...] "fit snugly ... giving a firm connection" [...] to the computer, typewriter-style keyboards, more advanced printers and sound generators, and even a hard disk interface, which Clive Sinclair thought was [...] "quite overgilding the lily". A wide range of software was also published. Within only a year of the ZX81's launch, around 200 independent companies had been established to manufacture and sell Sinclair-compatible hardware.

500|$|According to National Public Radio {{reviewer}} Linda Holmes, [...] "Ortved's thesis, essentially, is {{that lots}} of people are responsible for the success of The Simpsons, and their creator, Matt Groening, has too often been viewed as the sole source to the detriment of others who also deserve to be praised." [...] The Simpsons: An Uncensored, Unauthorized History is an oral history of the show, examining its beginnings, rise to success, impact on pop culture, as well as the <b>people</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> show, including the animators, writers and producers. The content consists mostly of quotations from various figures, which are tied together by comments from Ortved. The book includes entire chapters devoted to key figures such as Matt Groening, James L. Brooks, Sam Simon and Conan O'Brien. The book's foreword was written by Canadian author Douglas Coupland. The final chapters of the book consist mostly of commentary from Ortved, in which he states that he believes that quality of the show has declined since its early years.|$|E
500|$|Shearer is {{also known}} for his {{prolific}} work as a voice actor on The Simpsons. Matt Groening, {{the creator of the}} show, was a fan of Shearer's work, while Shearer was a fan of a column Groening used to write. Shearer was asked if he {{wanted to be in the}} series, but he was initially reluctant because he thought the recording sessions would be too much trouble. He felt voice acting was [...] "not a lot of fun" [...] because traditionally, voice actors record their parts separately. He was told that the actors would record their lines together and after three calls, executive producer James L. Brooks managed to convince Shearer to join the cast. Shearer's first impression of The Simpsons was that it was funny. Shearer, who thought it was a [...] "pretty cool" [...] way to work, found it peculiar that the members of the cast were adamant about not being known to the public as the <b>people</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> voices.|$|E
500|$|Uttarakhand is {{also well}} known for the mass {{agitation}} of the 1970s {{that led to the}} formation of the Chipko environmental movement and other social movements. Though primarily a livelihood movement rather than a forest conservation movement, it went on to become a rallying point for many future environmentalists, environmental protests, and movements the world over and created a precedent for non-violent protest. It stirred up the existing civil society in India, which began to address the issues of tribal and marginalized people. So much so that, a quarter of a century later, India Today mentioned the <b>people</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> [...] "forest satyagraha" [...] of the Chipko movement as amongst [...] "100 people who shaped India". One of Chipko's most salient features was the mass participation of female villagers. Both female and male activists played pivotal roles in the movement.
