50|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{contract}} of indemnity insurance is to restore the insured to his position quo ante. Nothing more than patrimonial indemnity may be recovered, as {{is illustrated by the}} rules on over-insurance and double insurance. The insured is not entitled to make a profit out of his loss. It is accordingly said that the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>indemnity</b> governs indemnity insurance.|$|E
50|$|People have an {{insurable}} {{interest in their}} property up {{to the value of}} the property, but no more. The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>indemnity</b> dictates that the insured be compensated for a loss of property, but not paid more than what the property was worth. A lender who grants a mortgage on the security of a house has an {{insurable interest}} in that house, but only up to the amount outstanding on the loan.|$|E
5000|$|Most, {{and until}} 2005 all, common law jurisdictions require the insured {{to have an}} {{insurable}} {{interest in the subject}} matter of the insurance. An insurable interest is that legal or equitable relationship between the insured and {{the subject matter of the}} insurance, separate from the existence of the insurance relationship, by which the insured would be prejudiced by the occurrence of the event insured against, or conversely would take a benefit from its non-occurrence. Insurable interest was long held to be morally necessary in insurance contracts to distinguish them, as enforceable contracts, from unenforceable gambling agreements (binding [...] "in honour" [...] only) and to quell the practice, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, of taking out life policies upon the lives of strangers. The requirement for insurable interest was removed in non-marine English law, possibly inadvertently, by the provisions of the Gambling Act 2005. [...] It remains a requirement in marine insurance law and other common law systems, however; and few systems of law will allow an insured to recover in respect of an event that has not caused the insured a genuine loss, whether the insurable interest doctrine is relied upon, or whether, as in common law systems, the courts rely upon the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>indemnity</b> to hold that an insured may not recover more than his true loss.|$|E
5000|$|The Court {{held that}} the Fifth Amendment does not require that the United States pay a public condemnee {{compensation}} measured by the cost of acquiring a substitute facility that the condemnee {{has a duty to}} acquire, when the market value of the condemned property is ascertainable and when there is no showing of manifest injustice. Rather, [...] "Just compensation" [...] under the Fifth Amendment normally is to be measured by the market value of the property {{at the time of the}} taking, and this case is not one in which an exception is required because fair market value is not ascertainable. The testimony at trial established that there was a fairly robust market for sanitary landfill properties. The Court did also not believe that an award of compensation measured by market value here to be fundamentally inconsistent with the basic <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>indemnity</b> embodied in the Just Compensation Clause.|$|R

60|$|However {{that may}} be, I {{consider}} these things at present chiefly in {{one point of}} view, as obstructions {{to the war on}} Jacobinism, which must stand as long as the powers think its extirpation but a secondary object, and think of taking advantage, under the name <b>of</b> <b>indemnity</b> and security, to make war upon the whole nation of France, royal and Jacobin, for the aggrandizement of the allies, on the ordinary <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> interest, as if no Jacobinism existed in the world.|$|R
40|$|The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>indemnity</b> is well-accepted in {{the field}} of {{insurance}} and is also commonly assumed in the literature of optimal contract design. However, should this principle be imposed on all insurance contracts without exceptions? Does there exist an insurance contract that is optimal for both the insurer and the insured even as the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>indemnity</b> is violated? The answer is yes. This paper demonstrates that in the insurance market there do exist contracts in which optimality is accompanied by a violation of the indemnity principle if the insurer and insured have deviant beliefs in loss distribution. We further use retrospective rating as an example to explain why an insurance contract, violating the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>indemnity,</b> commonly exists in commercial insurance, especially where moral hazard and adverse selection is less severe...|$|E
40|$|When the Supreme Court {{discussed}} the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>indemnity</b> in Ridgecrest New Zealand Ltd v IAG New Zealand Ltd, it {{referred to it}} as ‘awkward’ {{in the context of a}} replacement policy. The application of the indemnity principle in the case raises further questions about the nature of the principle in insurance contracts. It is submitted that the indemnity principle is currently enforceable not as a legal test or as a policy-based presumption; rather, it is applicable mostly because it is presumed the parties intended it to apply. While some policy arguments underlying the principle can be made, these are less relevant than they once were. The rationales and rules of, exceptions to, and law reform concerning the principle are considered in this paper in order to evaluate the status of the principle. Conclusions are drawn from analysis of these elements and in light of Ridgecrest and two other cases from 2014, one in the Court of Appeal and another in the Supreme Court...|$|E
40|$|State valued policy {{laws for}} homeowners {{insurance}} are a notable {{exception to the}} <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>indemnity.</b> These laws require that insureds receive the full face value of their insurance {{in the event of}} a total loss, irrespective of the face value’s relationship to the house’s actual cash value. This Paper explores the consequences of these laws, ultimately concluding that they actually hurt policyholders despite their pro-homeowner justification. With a combination of the first empirical test of the cost imposed by valued policy laws as well as theoretical arguments, this Paper finds that valued policy laws hurt insureds in several ways: insureds pay more than they otherwise would for insurance; insurers experience diminished incentives to engage in risk classification; and insureds cannot cheaply plan for unanticipated increases in housing prices. Justifications to continue valued policy laws have lost much of their force in light of modern insurance practices. Repealing valued policy laws could provide significant welfare gains to insureds while bringing homeowners insurance more in line with fundamental principles of insurance...|$|E

40|$|Subrogation is an {{important}} concept in insurance law. There are several reasons why an insurer that has paid for a loss {{should be allowed to}} recover from those legally responsible. First, the insured is prevented from recovering twice for the same loss, preserving the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>indemnity.</b> Second, the insurer is reimbursed for the payment it has made. Third, the tort-feasor, who is legally responsible, is prevented from receiving a windfall by being absolved of liability. 2 ̆ 2 Stated simply, subrogation is a creature of equity having for its purpose the working out of an equitable adjustment between the parties by securing the ultimate discharge of a debt by the person who in equity and good conscience ought to pay it. In Stetina v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., the Nebraska Supreme Court restricted the insurer 2 ̆ 7 s right to subrogation on payment of a loss to its insured. If the 2 ̆ 2 no subrogation against insured 2 ̆ 2 rule is interpreted to prevent an insurer from ever having subrogation rights against one insured by it, situations may occur in which the claimant insured is allowed double recovery or where the tort-feasor insured receives the windfall of being absolved of liability, both {{at the expense of the}} insurer...|$|E
40|$|Fraud {{is always}} a concern when an insurer issues a policy to an assured. An assured can take out {{numerous}} policies and claim indemnity under all the policies, which {{would result in the}} assured receiving more than he is entitled to. Is the fear of fraud justifiable and are such exclusions or limitations in insurance contracts preventing recovery where there is other insurance effective? Further, is there sufficient protection for insurers by way of contribution from other insurers. It is beneficial to look at the history and development of the law of insurance, to understand how the law relating to double insurance has developed and the factors the courts may take into account when deciding such issues. The courts in many jurisdictions have tried to deal with the problems which have arisen as a result of such clauses. The courts have also dealt with {{the question of whether the}} assured is or should be given any protection when double insurance arises, and if so, whether the insurer has to pay out under the insurance policy. However, where there are rateable proportion clauses with other types of clauses, the solution is not that clear. It is quite common for judges, when dealing with such cases, to conclude that the case before it is not a case of double insurance. In some cases, even though the trial judge may hold that the case before him, on the facts, were sufficient to give rise to double insurance, on appeal, the appeal courts have come to the conclusion that the facts of the case do not give rise to one of double insurance. This clearly shows what a difficult concept double insurance is. This has resulted in the courts not actually being able, even till now, to provide any real solid rules or guidelines on double insurance. Further, even though an assured has taken out insurance with numerous insurers he will not be able to recover more than the loss he has actually suffered. This is the general <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>indemnity.</b> The next problem for an assured is then, from which insurer the assured can seek recovery from. Is there a particular order when seeking recovery or can he recover from whichever insurer he chooses? At the moment, the law on this is also unclear. <br/...|$|E

5000|$|The Divine Principle goes on {{to explain}} three types <b>of</b> <b>indemnity</b> {{conditions}}. Equal conditions <b>of</b> <b>indemnity</b> pay back the full value of what was lost. The biblical verse [...] "life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth" [...] (Exod.21:23-24) is quoted as an example <b>of</b> an equal <b>indemnity</b> condition. Lesser conditions <b>of</b> <b>indemnity</b> provide a benefit greater than the price that is paid. Faith, baptism, and the eucharist are mentioned as examples <b>of</b> lesser <b>indemnity</b> conditions. Greater conditions <b>of</b> <b>indemnity</b> come about when a person fails in a lesser condition. In that case a greater price must be paid {{to make up for}} the earlier failure. Abraham's attempted sacrifice of his son Isaac (Gen. 22:1-18) and the Israelites' 40 years of wandering in the wilderness under Moses (Num.14:34) are mentioned as examples <b>of</b> greater <b>indemnity</b> conditions. The Divine Principle then explains that an indemnity condition must reverse the course by which the mistake or loss came about. Indemnity, at its core, is required of humans because God is pure, and purity cannot relate directly with impurity. Indemnification is the vehicle that allows a [...] "just and righteous" [...] God to work through mankind. Jesus' statement that God had forsaken him (Matt.27:46) and Christianity's history of martyrdom are mentioned as examples of this. The Divine Principle then states that human beings, not God or the angels, are the ones responsible for making indemnity conditions.|$|R
