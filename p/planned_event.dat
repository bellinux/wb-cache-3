Rabbi Shmuel Butman announced his plan to crown the Rebbe. The Rebbe, who had been paralyzed and speechless since March the previous year, would join the daily prayers on a special balcony that was built for him to easily be wheeled. Butman planned to crown the Rebbe on January 30, 1993 after the evening prayers. However, when the Rebbe got word of the <b>planned</b> <b>event,</b> he communicated to his secretaries Leibel Groner and Yudel Krinsky that he would only attend for the usual evening service.

2500|$|The Fountains of Bellagio is a vast, choreographed {{water feature}} with {{performances}} set to light and music. (See musical fountain.) The performances {{take place in}} front of the Bellagio hotel and are visible from numerous vantage points on the Strip, both from the street and neighboring structures. The show takes place every 30 minutes in the afternoons and early evenings, and every 15 minutes from 8pm to midnight. Two minutes before a water show starts, the nozzles begin to break the water surface and the lights illuminating the hotel tower turn to a purple hue (usually), or red-white-and-blue for certain music. Shows may be cancelled without warning because of high wind, although shows usually run with less power in face of wind. A single show may be skipped to avoid interference with a <b>planned</b> <b>event.</b> Additional shows can occur for special occasions including weddings.|$|E
2500|$|Syracuse {{was founded}} in 734 or 733BC by Greek {{settlers}} from Corinth and Tenea, led by the oecist (colonizer) Archias. There are many attested variants {{of the name of}} the city including [...] Syrakousai, [...] Syrakosai and [...] Syrako. A possible origin of the city's name was given by Vibius Sequester citing first Stephanus Byzantius in that there was a Syracusian marsh (...) called Syrako and secondly Marcian's Periegesis wherein Archias gave the city the name of a nearby marsh; hence one gets Syrako (and thereby Syrakousai and other variants) for the name of Syracuse, a name also attested by Epicharmus. The settlement of Syracuse was a <b>planned</b> <b>event,</b> as a strong central leader, Arkhias the aristocrat, laid out how property would be divided up for the settlers, as well as plans for how the streets of the settlement should be arranged, and how wide they should be. The nucleus of the ancient city was the small island of Ortygia. The settlers found the land fertile and the native tribes to be reasonably well-disposed to their presence. The city grew and prospered, and for some time stood as the most powerful Greek city anywhere in the Mediterranean. Colonies were founded at Akrai (664BC), Kasmenai (643BC), Akrillai (7th centuryBC), Helorus (7th centuryBC) and Kamarina (598BC).|$|E
