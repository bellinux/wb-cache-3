5000|$|In {{one of the}} {{critical}} moments of the Apollo 11 mission, the Apollo Guidance Computer together with the on-board flight software averted an abort of the landing on the Moon. Three minutes before the Lunar lander reached the Moon's surface, several computer alarms were triggered. The computer was overloaded with interrupts caused by incorrectly <b>phased</b> <b>power</b> supplied to the lander's rendezvous radar. The program alarms indicated [...] "executive overflows", meaning the guidance computer could not complete all of its tasks in real time and had to postpone some of them. The asynchronous executive designed by J. Halcombe Laning was used by Hamilton's team to develop asynchronous flight software: Because of the flight software's system-software's error detection and recovery techniques that included its system-wide “kill and recompute” from a [...] "safe place" [...] restart approach to its snapshot and rollback techniques, the Display Interface Routines (AKA the priority displays) together with its man-in-the-loop capabilities were able to be created {{in order to have}} the capability to interrupt the astronauts' normal mission displays with priority displays of critical alarms in case of an emergency. This depended on our assigning a unique priority to every process in the software {{in order to ensure that}} all of its events would take place in the correct order and at the right time relative to everything else that was going on.Hamilton's priority alarm displays interrupted the astronauts' normal displays to warn them that there was an emergency “giving the astronauts a go/no go decision (to land or not to land)”. Jack Garman, a NASA computer engineer in mission control, recognized the meaning of the errors that were presented to the astronauts by the priority displays and shouted, [...] "Go, go!" [...] And on they went. Dr. Paul Curto, senior technologist who nominated Hamilton for a NASA Space Act Award, called Hamilton's work [...] "the foundation for ultra-reliable software design." ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports a}} novel {{strategy}} for analysing a single <b>phase</b> <b>power</b> system feeding A non-linear load. This strategy {{is based on}} a new theory to transform the traditional single <b>phase</b> <b>power</b> system into an equivalent two-axis orthogonal system. This system is based on complementing the single phase system with a fictitious second phase so that both of the two phases generate an orthogonal power system. This would yield a power system which is analogous to the three <b>phase</b> <b>power</b> system but with the phase shift between successive phases equal to pi/ 2 instead of 2 pi/ 3. Application of this novel approach makes it possible to use the complex or Gauss domain analytical method in a similar way to the well known method of instantaneous reactive power for the three <b>phase</b> <b>power</b> system instigated by Akagi et al in 1984. Thus, for the fictitious two-axis <b>phase</b> <b>power</b> system, the concept of instantaneous active and reactive power could be instigated. Moreover, the concept of instantaneous power factor could be defined. The novel strategy of power system analysis outlined in this paper is applied to a single <b>phase</b> <b>power</b> system feeding a non-linear load in conjunction with an active power filter. The latter serves the purpose of compensating for either of the instantaneous reactive power or the harmonic current distortion in the single <b>phase</b> <b>power</b> system under investigation or for compensating of both. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the novel single <b>phase</b> <b>power</b> system analysis reported in this paper...|$|R
40|$|A Smith Motor is a {{three phase}} {{induction}} motor that has shunt capacitors parallel to its induction coils. The shunt capacitors provide balance {{and allow the}} motor to operate using a single <b>phase</b> <b>power</b> supply. Preliminary {{studies show that the}} Smith Motor is more efficient than a single <b>phase</b> induction motor <b>powered</b> by a single <b>phase</b> <b>power</b> supply, but less efficient than a three <b>phase</b> induction motor <b>powered</b> by a three <b>phase</b> <b>power</b> supply. The Smith Motor’s advantage is its ability to operate from a single <b>phase</b> <b>power</b> source instead of having a three <b>phase</b> <b>power</b> source installed. Its limitation to operate properly for varying loads is its disadvantage. One way to solve this problem is to develop a control system that can change the capacitors to correspond with the different sets of loads. The three phase induction motor will be tested in order to calculate proper shunt capacitor values for the Smith Motor. Then the Smith Motor will be tested for its efficiency, power factor, winding current, and winding voltage at various loads. The data will be utilized in order to construct a control system (a switch) that changes the capacitor values. This will allow the Smith Motor to operate in a more balanced state for varying loads...|$|R
