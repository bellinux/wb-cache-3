25|$|It is {{possible}} to use any type of solar thermal <b>panel</b> (<b>sheet</b> and tubes, roll-bond, heat pipe, thermal plates) or hybrid (mono/polycrystalline, thin film) {{in combination with the}} heat pump. The use of a hybrid panel is preferable because it allows to cover a part of the electricity demand of the heat pump and reduce the power consumption and consequently the variable costs of the system.|$|E
50|$|Drywall (also {{known as}} plasterboard, wallboard, gypsum <b>panel,</b> <b>sheet</b> rock, or gypsum board) is a panel made of calcium sulfate {{dihydrate}} (gypsum) with or without additives and normally pressed between a facer and a backer (typically thick sheets of paper). It is used to make interior walls and ceilings. The plaster is mixed with fiber (typically paper and/or fibreglass), plasticizer, foaming agent, and various additives that can decrease mildew, increase fire resistance, and lower water absorption.|$|E
50|$|The Haskell canoe {{was made}} from a sheet of three-ply haskelite plywood, three-sixteenths of an inch thick. The <b>panel</b> <b>sheet</b> was first {{softened}} by boiling for three hours and then pressed into a canoe form by a machine. The slotted ends at the bow and stern were fastened together with a bent strip of ash. A hot steam process was used to form the inside belly double curvature of the bottom part of the canoe. Once the canoe dried it held that shape. The final construction was to attach the gunwales to the sides and seats to permanently form the canoe to a hull of one solid component.|$|E

50|$|V G Siddhartha {{has taken}} 1.85 million {{hectares}} of Amazonian forestland on a 30-year lease from the Republic of Guyana in South America {{to start a}} furniture business in India. The idea is to transport cut logs on chartered ships from the Guyanese capital Georgetown to the Mangalore Port and then carry them via road to the Coffee Day Group’s furniture plant in Chikmagalur. The Amazonian hard wood varieties coming to Indian shores through this route will include Greenheart, Purpleheart, Wallaba and Bullet Wood. The royalty that Siddhartha will pay the Guyanese government is not clear. Siddhartha {{declined to comment on}} the matter. A couple of years ago, the Coffee Day Group had started a furniture unit to capitalize on the huge depository of full-grown silver oak, teak wood, rose wood and mahogany trees grown in its 15,000-acres of coffee gardens in Chikmagalur. The unit designs multi-purpose furniture for home, kitchen, office, hotels and retail outlets. It also manufactures all kinds of plywood, wood boards, <b>panel</b> <b>sheets</b> and beadings, making use of the wood waste and saw powder. But it has so far remained mostly as a captive unit, serving the requirements of the Group’s coffee outlets and the resorts under the brand name Serai.|$|R

50|$|An IGC firms {{project in}} Sialkot, Pakistan, {{one of the}} world’s top {{producers}} of footballs, found that employees in factories producing footballs resisted a new technology that limited waste and improved efficiency.

While one of the largest companies in the city quickly adopted the new technology for almost all its production, few others followed suit. Based on further investigation, the researchers conjectured that take-up was slow because employees were resisting the new technology. Cutters were paid per piece, with no incentive to reduce waste, and were concerned that the new die would slow them down and reduce their incomes.|$|R
