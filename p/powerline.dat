5|$|In Coffee County, local {{officials}} reported wind gusts had blown a carport {{into a wall}} of a house. Marengo County received moderate damage, mostly limited to power outages and minor roof and structural damage caused by fallen trees and powerlines. Many customers were without electric power {{for at least a}} day, and numerous county roads were covered with debris. A person was injured in Dallas County when a tree landed on their car. Five homes and one business were damaged due to high winds, and thousands of people county-wide experienced power outages. Greene County reported hundreds of downed trees and powerlines causing County Roads 148 and 20 and State Highways 11, 43 and 14 to be temporarily closed. In Forkland, a mobile home caught fire when a <b>powerline</b> fell on the home. A motorist ran into a fallen tree in Boligee although did not sustain injuries. In Perry County, 2,200homes were without electric power for several hours, and several vehicles and homes were damaged. A structural fire occurred in Russell County and was believed to be ignited by downed powerlines.|$|E
5|$|The {{strong winds}} left {{considerable}} tree and <b>powerline</b> damage. At {{the worst of}} the storm, 23,000 of the island's 30,000power subscribers were without electricity. Damage to power lines totaled to $385,000 (2001USD, $468,700 2008USD). The strong winds also caused considerable damage to vegetation. Three cruise ships weathered the storm at Saint George Harbour, where the powerful winds ripped out a post and snapped a mooring line, leaving a ship drifting in the harbor. One crew member was minorly injured. Over a dozen boats broke free from their moorings, resulting in them running aground or sinking. In all, 87boats were affected to some degree, with marine damage totaling to about $665,000 (2001USD, $809,600 2008USD). The winds also caused minor damage to 175properties on the island, primarily to houses. Damage to houses amounted to about $425,000 (2001USD, $517,400 2008USD). Overall damage was moderate, totaling to about $1.4million (2001USD, $1.7million 2008USD). No fatalities were reported, though a few storm-related injuries occurred.|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{investigates the}} risks that arise from {{exposure}} to noise from powerpoles and <b>powerlines</b> in Serzedelo, in the municipality of Guimarães, in Portugal. This research focused on four guiding questions: Can <b>powerlines</b> cause noise? Do <b>powerlines</b> cause discomfort? Do <b>powerlines</b> cause discomfort due to noise? And can <b>powerlines</b> effect human health? Two groups were {{the basis of the}} study: people that were exposed to electromagnetic waves and people that were not. the research pointed to the harmful influence of the presence of <b>powerlines</b> and high-voltage masts in residential areas and the damage to the cells in the human body. This type of environmental noise, which has the spectral content of a low frequency, typically tonal noise and a very high speed of propagation, is a complex source to explain in terms of the health profiles of the human population living in Serzedelo, located in an area that is densely occupied by high voltage <b>powerlines</b> and powerpole...|$|R

40|$|Along {{with their}} {{essential}} role in electricity transmission and distribution, some <b>powerlines</b> also generate large concentrations of corona ions. This study aimed at comprehensive investigation of corona ions, vertical dc e-field, ambient aerosol particle charge and particle number concentration levels in the proximity of some high/sub-transmission voltage <b>powerlines.</b> The influence of meteorology on the instantaneous value of these parameters, and the possible existence of links or associations between the parameters measured were also statistically investigated. The presence {{of positive and negative}} polarities of corona ions was associated with variation in the mean vertical dc e-field, ambient ion and particle charge concentration level. Though these variations increased with wind speed, their values also decreased with distance from the <b>powerlines.</b> Predominately positive polarities of ions were recorded up to a distance of 150 m (with the maximum values recorded 50 m downwind of the <b>powerlines).</b> At 200 m from the source, negative ions predominated. Particle number concentration levels however remained relatively constant (103 particle cm- 3) irrespective of the sampling site and distance from the <b>powerlines.</b> Meteorological factors of temperature, humidity and wind direction showed no influence on the electrical parameters measured. The study also discovered that e-field measurements were not necessarily a true representation of the ground-level ambient ion/particle charge concentrations. ...|$|R
