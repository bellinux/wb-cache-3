5|$|Florida {{honored the}} American {{alligator}} in 1987, but the Gators have titled the University of Florida's teams since 1911. In that year, a printer made a spur-of-the-moment decision to print an alligator emblem on {{a shipment of}} the schools football pennants; the mascot stuck, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> team captain's nickname was Gator.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinction}} between the heavy infantry types began to blur, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> state was now assuming the responsibility of providing standard-issue equipment. In addition, the shortage of available manpower led to a greater burden being placed upon Rome's allies {{for the provision of}} allied troops. Eventually, the Romans were forced to begin hiring mercenaries to fight alongside the legions.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinction}} between the heavy infantry types of hastati, principes and triarii began to blur, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> state was now assuming the responsibility of providing standard-issue equipment to all but the first class of troops, who alone were able to afford their own equipment. By the time of Polybius, the triarii or their successors still represented a distinct heavy infantry type armed with a unique style of cuirass, but the hastati and principes had become indistinguishable.|$|E
50|$|In late 2013 {{asteroid}} P/2013 R3 {{was observed}} breaking apart, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> YORP effect.|$|R
50|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> 1943 {{injury to}} his eye, Mayo {{developed}} a peculiar habit of ducking after every pitch.|$|R
25|$|Scottish {{tradition}} is less used, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> spurious {{nature of the}} Ossian cycle, a nineteenth-century fraud claiming to have much older sources.|$|R
5|$|Pairs may {{breed in}} {{isolation}} or in loose colonies, and will readily use nest boxes. In a Spanish study, boxes {{made from a}} mixture of wood and concrete (woodcrete) had a much higher occupancy rate than wooden boxes (76.5% versus 33.5%), and birds nesting in woodcrete sites had earlier clutches, a shorter incubation period and more breeding attempts per season. Clutch size and chick condition did not differ between nest box types, but reproductive success was higher in woodcrete, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> synthetic nests were 1.5°C warmer than their wooden counterparts.|$|E
5|$|Castle Park (sometimes {{referred}} to as Castle Green) is a public open space in Bristol, England, managed by Bristol City Council. It is bounded by the Floating Harbour and Castle Street to the south, Lower Castle Street to the east, and Broad Weir, Newgate and Wine Street to the north. Its western boundary is less obviously defined and {{has been the subject}} of controversy, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> area around High Street and St Mary-le-Port Church, though not part of the park and always intended for development, is often considered at the same time as the park. The park was completed and opened on 30 September 1978, and occupies most of the site which had contained Bristol's main shopping area. Much of this area was heavily damaged in the Blitz during the Second World War, and that which remained was subsequently demolished.|$|E
5|$|King Kalākaua trusted Rosenberg's {{skill as}} a fortune teller, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> way Rosenberg chanted in Hebrew {{reminded}} him of ancient Hawaiian rites. In January 1887, the king—who had become increasingly autocratic and was facing several scandals—granted Rosenberg a private audience at the palace. The king and Rosenberg became close, and routinely visited each other for several {{days at a time}} and held long conversations. During the audiences, Rosenberg told Bible stories and read from the Talmud. He began to teach the king basic Hebrew, and gave him an ornate Torah and yad that he had brought with him to Hawaii. He also claimed to have found references to Hawaii in ancient Hebrew texts, a statement that encouraged the king to restore aspects of Hawaiian religion. The king had previously sought instruction from several people he regarded as prophets and had established a society dedicated to the revival of native Hawaiian traditions. Finally, the king declared Rosenberg his kahuna-kilokilo, a royal soothsayer.|$|E

50|$|The {{common name}} pawpaw, also spelled paw paw, paw-paw, and papaw, {{probably}} derives from <b>the</b> Spanish papaya, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> superficial similarity of their fruits.|$|R
5|$|The {{number of}} eggs laid depends on species, with batch sizes ranging {{from two to}} several dozen. The total number of eggs {{produced}} in a female's lifetime (fecundity) varies from around one hundred to several thousand. In some species, the flea lives in the nest or burrow and the eggs are deposited on the substrate, but in others, the eggs are laid on the host itself and can easily fall off onto the ground. Because of this, areas where the host rests and sleeps {{become one of the}} primary habitats of eggs and developing larvae. The eggs take around two days to two weeks to hatch. Experiments have shown that fleas lay more eggs on hosts which have limited food intakes, and that eggs and larvae survive better under these conditions, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> host's immune system is compromised.|$|E
25|$|Water {{sports are}} very popular on Prince Edward Island during the summer, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of St. Lawrence and the Northumberland Strait are warmer than the Atlantic Ocean off {{the shores of}} nearby New England.|$|E
25|$|Some of his works, {{for example}} {{the setting of the}} Magnificat on Tone VI, were {{probably}} intended as replacements for equivalent settings by Dufay – <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> originals were too hard for inexperienced singers.|$|E

50|$|At {{their best}} Shumate's prose poems offer taut, {{timeless}} parables whose morals prove complex without loss of clarity, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> soothing precision of his voice.|$|R
25|$|None of this {{put a stop}} to {{his career}} at court, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> king had an equally rowdy reputation. In fact, in 1632 he would become {{secretary}} to the king, thus reaching the apex of his political career.|$|E
25|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> towns {{themselves}} are such strong entities, most areas of New England never developed municipal forms {{based on the}} compact populated place concept. This contrasts with states with civil townships, which typically have extensive networks of villages or boroughs that carve out or overlay the townships.|$|E
25|$|The two jackals' names transmogrified into Kalila and Dimna in the Persian version. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> {{first section}} {{constituted}} {{most of the}} work, or because translators could find no simple equivalent in Zoroastrian Pahlavi for the concept expressed by the Sanskrit word 'Panchatantra', the jackals' names, Kalila and Dimna, became the generic name for the entire work in classical times.|$|E
5000|$|... omelette: Seventeenth century English from French la lemelle ("omelette") {{taken for}} l'alemelle; {{ultimately}} from Latin lamella ("blade"), <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> thin {{shape of the}} omelette (SOED).|$|R
50|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> heavy {{workload}} {{of being}} Doge, Contarini fell ill in early 1656, and, {{after a series}} of failed medical treatments, died on 1 May 1656.|$|R
50|$|The East Germanic {{languages}} are contrasted with North and West Germanic. However, the East Germanic languages shared many characteristics with North Germanic, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> later migration date.|$|R
25|$|Jesus {{might have}} entered Jerusalem on a donkey as a {{symbolic}} act, possibly to contrast with the triumphant entry that a Roman conqueror would make, or to enact a prophecy in Zechariah. Christian scripture makes the reference to Zechariah explicit, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> scene was invented as scribes looked to scripture to help them flesh {{out the details of}} the gospel narratives.|$|E
25|$|The prebendaries {{survived the}} reforms {{during the middle}} of the sixteenth century, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> cathedral had not been a monastic institution. The prebendal estates were taken over by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners in the later nineteenth century in {{exchange}} for a cash payment, the value of which was almost entirely lost to inflation during the twentieth century. The role of prebendary has become unpaid and largely honorary.|$|E
25|$|Adoption of the nixtamalization process did not {{accompany}} the grain to Europe and beyond, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> Europeans already had more efficient milling processes for hulling grain mechanically. Without alkaline processing, maize {{is a much}} less beneficial foodstuff, and malnutrition struck many areas where it became a dominant food crop. In the nineteenth century, pellagra epidemics were recorded in France, Italy, and Egypt, and kwashiorkor hit parts of Africa where maize had become a dietary staple.|$|E
50|$|In 1703 the Bishop of Senez, Jean Soanen {{destroyed}} the menhir. The plague of 1720 {{did not reach}} Barrême, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> cordon sanitaire established on the Verdon.|$|R

25|$|The U.S. UPN network {{presented}} two one-hour {{episodes of}} Iron Chef USA hosted by William Shatner around Christmas 2001. These shows were neither a critical nor popular success, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> show focused little on cookinga {{major part of}} the Japanese programme. The show had a small audience section with bleachers, and the audience yelled relentlessly during the show (sounding much like a sports audience). Shatner walked around the kitchen sampling the more expensive items, the chefs refused to say what they were doing, and the cameras rarely showed the food preparation.|$|E
25|$|By 1895, he was {{inspector-general}} of the cavalry, a post he {{held for}} 10 years. His tenure has been judged a success with reforms in training, cavalry schools, cavalry reserves and the remount services. He {{was not given}} an active command during the Russo-Japanese War, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> Tsar {{did not wish to}} hazard the prestige of the Romanovs and because he wanted a loyal general in command at home in case of domestic disturbances. Thus, Nicholas did not have the opportunity to gain experience in battlefield command.|$|E
25|$|The Confederate {{ships were}} ready for the attack, and they moved into {{position}} to intercept the Union fleet just beyond the minefield. At 6:47a.m., Tecumseh fired the first shot, the forts replied, and the action became general. The ships in the second column (except for Brooklyn) could not reply to the guns of the Confederate vessels, {{so they had to}} concentrate on the fort. Most of the damage done to the Federal fleet was caused by the enemy ships, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> fire from the fort was suppressed.|$|E
