5|$|Four years later, Luongo was {{selected}} to Team Canada for his third straight Olympics. Heading into the Sochi Games as the incumbent starter, there was much debate among the media {{as to whether he}} or Montreal Canadiens goaltender Carey <b>Price</b> <b>would</b> play most of Canada's games. With head coach Mike Babcock electing Price, Luongo received one start in the tournament, a round robin game against Austria, in which he recorded a 6-0 shutout. As a backup, earned his second Olympic gold medal, as Canada went on to defeat Sweden in the final 3-0.|$|E
5|$|Augustus' brother, Otto, {{devised the}} scheme to corner United Copper, {{believing that the}} Heinze family already {{controlled}} {{a majority of the}} company. He also believed that a significant number of the Heinze's shares had been borrowed, and sold short, by speculators betting that the stock <b>price</b> <b>would</b> drop, and that they could thus repurchase the borrowed shares cheaply, pocketing the difference. Otto proposed a short squeeze, whereby the Heinzes would aggressively purchase as many remaining shares as possible, and then force the short sellers to pay for their borrowed shares. The aggressive purchasing would drive up the share price, and, being unable to find shares elsewhere, the short sellers would have no option but to turn to the Heinzes, who could then name their price.|$|E
5|$|Encrypting {{ransomware}} reappeared in September 2013 with a Trojan {{known as}} CryptoLocker, which generated a 2048-bit RSA key pair and uploaded {{in turn to}} a command-and-control server, and used to encrypt files using a whitelist of specific file extensions. The malware threatened to delete the private key if a payment of Bitcoin or a pre-paid cash voucher was not made within 3 days of the infection. Due to the extremely large key size it uses, analysts and those affected by the Trojan considered CryptoLocker extremely difficult to repair. Even after the deadline passed, the private key could still be obtained using an online tool, but the <b>price</b> <b>would</b> increase to 10 BTC—which cost approximately US$2300 as of November 2013.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{models of}} neoclassical socialism {{were developed by}} Leon Walras, Enrico Barone (1908) and Oskar R. Lange (c. 1936). Lange and Fred M. Taylor (1929) proposed that central planning boards set prices through [...] "trial and error", making adjustments as shortages and surpluses occurred {{rather than relying on}} a free price mechanism. If there were shortages, <b>prices</b> <b>would</b> be raised; if there were surpluses, <b>prices</b> <b>would</b> be lowered. Raising the <b>prices</b> <b>would</b> encourage businesses to increase production, driven by their desire to increase their profits, and in doing so eliminate the shortage. Lowering the <b>prices</b> <b>would</b> encourage businesses to curtail production to prevent losses, which would eliminate the surplus. Therefore, it would be a simulation of the market mechanism, which Lange thought would be capable of effectively managing supply and demand.|$|R
50|$|Other {{apparent}} {{evidence against}} the Pigou effect from Japan may be its {{long period of}} stagnating consumer expenditure whilst prices were falling.

5|$|Rieber has {{suggested}} a {{package for the}} politicians, where he would create a company that would borrow money to build both the Ulriken Tunnel, a shortening of the line from Hønefoss to Sandvika (the Ringerike Line) and electrify the railway. Since NSB based their fares on the route length traveled, financing would be covered by a surcharge equal to the distance saved; ticket <b>price</b> <b>would</b> remain the same and within twenty years the debt would be covered. The government opposed the suggestion—Trygve Bratteli commenting {{that even though the}} financing was private, it would still have to use the same funding as government debt, and would jeopardize other projects, like the Nordland Line.|$|E
5|$|On June 15, 1994, the National Basketball Association's {{franchise}} relocation committee {{voted unanimously}} to block {{the sale of the}} franchise to Top Rank resulting in the Timberwolves remaining in Minneapolis through at least the 1994–95 season. Top Rank's offer was rejected by the league due to questions surrounding their financing plan. The $152 million purchase <b>price</b> <b>would</b> have been paid for through $40 million from unknown investors; up to $76.25 million in loans from banks that had yet to make commitments; and $50 million or more from undisclosed sources based on projected revenues from the un-built arena in New Orleans. Also, the league filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Minneapolis seeking an injunction against any transfer of the team from Minnesota. On June 21, 1994, the league officially denied sale of the franchise to Top Rank resulting in the Timberwolves remaining in Minneapolis. On June 28, 1994, Top Rank would file a counter-suit in Louisiana Civil District Court. The suit sought to have ownership fulfill their contractual obligation to sell the team to Top Rank. The following day, federal district court ruled that the franchise was to remain in Minneapolis through June 15, 1995.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} the role of prices in determining demand for roasted coffee in Sweden. This is of interest because many believe that consumer prices are high relative to green coffee-bean prices, and that lower consumer <b>prices</b> <b>would</b> increase demand for coffee beans. Coffee demand is estimated on data for the period 1968 - 2002. In the long run, changing preferences appear to determine demand for roasted coffee, and a reduction in consumer <b>prices</b> <b>would</b> only have a temporary impact on consumption. Hence a permanent decrease in consumer <b>prices</b> <b>would</b> only increase exports of coffee beans to Sweden for a couple of years.

60|$|It {{is to be}} {{remarked that}} this ratio would be {{precisely}} that in which the quantity of money had been increased. If the whole money in circulation was doubled, <b>prices</b> <b>would</b> be doubled. If it was only increased one fourth, <b>prices</b> <b>would</b> rise one fourth. There would be one fourth more money, all {{of which would be}} used to purchase goods of some description. When there had been time for the increased supply of money to reach all markets, or (according to the conventional metaphor) to permeate all the channels of circulation, all <b>prices</b> <b>would</b> have risen one fourth. But the general rise of price is independent of this diffusing and equalizing process. Even if some prices were raised more, and others less, the average rise would be one fourth. This is a necessary consequence of the fact that a fourth more money would have been given for only the same quantity of goods. General <b>prices,</b> therefore, <b>would</b> in any case be a fourth higher.|$|R

5000|$|In the book, Lange {{advocated}} {{the use of}} market tools (especially the neoclassical pricing theory) in economic planning of socialism and Marxism. He proposed that central planning boards set prices through [...] "trial and error", making adjustments as shortages and surpluses occur {{rather than relying on}} a free price mechanism. Under this system, central planners would arbitrarily pick a price for products manufactured in government factories and raise it or reduce, depending on whether it resulted in shortages or gluts. After this economic experiment had been run a few times, mathematical methods would be employed to plan the economy: if there were shortages, <b>prices</b> <b>would</b> be raised; if there were surpluses, <b>prices</b> <b>would</b> be lowered. Raising the <b>prices</b> <b>would</b> encourage businesses to increase production, driven by their desire to increase profits, and in doing so eliminate the shortage. Lowering the <b>prices</b> <b>would</b> encourage businesses to curtail production in order to prevent losses, which would eliminate the surplus. In Lange's opinion, such simulation of market mechanism would be capable of effectively managing supply and demand. Proponents of this idea argued that it combines the advantages of a market economy with those of socialist economy.|$|R

25|$|Reverse {{convertibles}} are a {{less common}} variation, mostly issued synthetically.

25|$|More {{dramatic}} was {{the pricing}} of the One Hundred and Two Hundred Dollar gold. The {{beginning of the}} millennium saw the One Hundred Dollar Gold at $259.95 but its price increased to $359.95 by 2006. In 1990, the price of such a coin would have been $245.00.

25|$|Like perfect {{competition}}, under {{monopolistic competition}} also, the firms can enter or exit freely. The firms will enter when the existing firms are making super-normal profits.

50|$|Following the {{devaluation}} of the French franc and the revaluation of the Deutsche Mark in 1969, the governments involved considered that agricultural support should {{not be subject to}} the fluctuations of floating exchange rates, arguing that lower <b>prices</b> <b>would</b> be unacceptable for farmers, while higher <b>prices</b> <b>would</b> be inflationary. Instead, they continued to use a form of fixed exchange rates for agricultural support, resulting in the so-called 'agricultural conversion rates' or 'green exchange rates', including the green pound after the United Kingdom's accession to the EEC on 1 January 1973.|$|R
50|$|The higher <b>prices</b> <b>would,</b> in the {{countries}} with a positive balance of trade, cause exports to decrease and imports to increase, which will alter the balance of trade downwards towards a neutral balance.
