40|$|Glucose,methanol and <b>potassium</b> <b>biphthalate</b> were {{respectively}} used as electrons for denitrification,which {{was carried}} out at C/N ratio of 4 and 10,to compare their impact on nitrate removal rate. Experimental results demonstrated that glucose was superior to methanol and <b>potassium</b> <b>biphthalate</b> for accelerating nitrate removal at C/N ratio of 4 and initial nitrate nitrogen of 60 mg/L,in which methanol was superior to <b>potassium</b> <b>biphthalate.</b> But when C/N ratio was 10,these organic compounds gave similar effect. For nitrate removal kinetics,nitrate removal rate increased with increasing of initial nitrate nitrogen concentration corresponding to glucose and <b>potassium</b> <b>biphthalate</b> as electron donors at both C/N of 4 and 10,which could be described with Monod model. While <b>potassium</b> <b>biphthalate</b> as electron,nitrate nitrogen removal increased with increasing of initial nitrate nitrogen concentration at first,and then decreased,which showed Aiba inhibition model. For all situations,glucose gave the maximum nitrate-removal rate (r max) and minimum half-maximum-rate concentration (K S) ...|$|E
40|$|Three {{different}} electrochemical methods {{confirm the}} growth processes of polyfurfural on platinum electrodes in aqueous solutions. The electrochemical oxidative polymerization of furfural occurs only with 0. 10 mol L- 1 <b>potassium</b> <b>biphthalate</b> as the supporting electrolyte. Electrochemical and spectroscopic methods are employed {{to characterize the}} polymeric film produced. Based on spectroscopic data, a polymeric structure involving furfural and biphthalate anions is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{optimization}} {{of culture}} medium with statistical methods {{is widely used}} in filamentous fungi glycosyl hydrolase production. The implementation of such methodology in bioreactors is very expensive as it requires several pH-controlled systems operating in parallel {{in order to test}} a large number of culture media components. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate <b>potassium</b> <b>biphthalate</b> buffer for pH control, which allows the optimization studies to be performed in shake flasks. The results have shown that buffering the culture medium with 0. 1 M <b>potassium</b> <b>biphthalate</b> allowed pH control, resulting in a decrease of the standard deviation of triplicates for pH and activities of glycosyl hydrolase measurements. The use of this buffer allowed shake flask culture media optimization of enzyme production by Trichoderma harzianum, increasing the cellulase activity by more than 2 times compared to standard unbuffered culture medium. The same buffer can be used for culture media optimization of other fungi, such as Penicillium echinulatum...|$|E
40|$|In this study, the {{corrosion}} protection provided by films of self-assembled molecules on the AA 2024 -T 3 aluminum alloy has been evaluated by electrochemical and non electrochemical techniques. The film {{was obtained by}} immersion of this alloy samples in a solution of 90 mg L- 1 alkane-diphosphonate at 50 °C for 5 minutes. Chromating conversion treatment with trivalent or hexavalent chromium {{was carried out by}} immersion of AA 2024 -T 3 alloy samples for 2 minutes in a 20 % (v/v) solution of 650 Chromical TCP (SurTec) at 40 °C. Electrochemical characterization was performed by measurements of the open circuit potential (OCP), potentiodynamic polarization curves (PPC) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in a solution of 0. 5 mol L- 1 sodium sulfate buffered with a solution of <b>biphthalate</b> <b>potassium</b> (0. 1 mol L- 1) and sodium hydroxide (0. 1 mol L- 1) as the electrolyte. SAM films obtained were analysed by infrared spectroscopy and SAM was found in surface. Surface observation by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that the trivalent chromium layers ere deposited on metal surface. The results show that the surface treatment with self-assembled molecules provides protection against corrosion of the AA 2024 -T 3 aluminum alloy...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} the laser {{vaporization}} and ionization of individual micron-size particles is presented whereby a particle is ionized by a laser pulse while in flight in the beam. Ionization in the beam offers a real-time analytical capability and eliminates any possible substrate-sample interferences during an analysis. An experimental arrangement using a high-energy Nd-YAG laser is described, and {{results are presented}} for ions generated from <b>potassium</b> <b>biphthalate</b> particles (1. 96 micron in diameter). The method proposed here is useful for the chemical analysis of aerosol particles by mass spectrometry and for other spectroscopic and chemical kinetic studies...|$|E
30|$|Bhattacharya et al. {{group was}} the first to report single-step {{electrodeposition}} of CISe thin films using triethanol amine (TEA) as complexing agents [56]. Since then, several works on electrodeposition of CISe/CIGSe using TEA have been reported as it can form strong complexes with Cu 2 + and HSeO 2 – ions and weak complexing with the In 3 + ions [57]. Calixto et al. reported the electrodeposition of pinhole free stoichiometric CIGSe using low concentrations of 2.56  mM Cu 2 +, 2.40  mM In 3 +, 5.7  mM Ga 3 +, and 4.5  mM Se 4 + ions in the bath at a pH of 2.5. The electrolyte was stabilized using a buffer of pH 3 (pHydrion mixture of sulphamic acid and <b>potassium</b> <b>biphthalate)</b> along with LiCl as supporting electrolyte [55]. Recent works by Liu et al. have suggested that by increasing the sodium sulfamate concentration, (Cu[*]+[*]Se)/(In[*]+[*]Ga) decreases, while gallium content increases and the film composition transforms from Cu rich to Cu poor [58]. Using KCN− as the complexing agent, the reduction potential difference between of Cu 2 + and Ga 3 + was only 80  mV, whereas 870  mV difference for un-complexed (Cu,Ga) species [59]. At high thiocyanate complex concentrations, the predominant species is Cu (I) in soluble form. Furthermore, the reduction of Ga can get catalyzed in the presence of thiocyanate (CNS−) ions. This makes thiocyanate a suitable complexing agent in CIGSe/CGSe electroplating [60].|$|E
