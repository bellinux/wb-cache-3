Both the East Pacific Rise and Kyushu-Palau Ridge samples showed Ne excess relative to Ar and a monotonic decrease from Xe to Ar {{when compared with}} <b>air</b> noble <b>gas</b> abundance. This characteristic noble gas abundance pattern (type 2, classified by Ozima and Alexander) is interpreted {{to be due to}} a two-stage degassing from a noble gas reservoir with originally atmospheric abundance. In the Kyushu-Palau Ridge sample, noble gases are nearly ten times more abundant than in the East Pacific Rise samples. This may be attributed to an oceanic crust contamination in the former mantle source. There is no correlation between the He content and that of the other noble gas in the CYAMEX samples.

In the present work, a transversal granular flow model and two numerical models for {{the description of the}} granular bed of a rotary kiln are developed for the analysis of a Calcium Aluminate rotary kiln from an industrial partner. From the transversal granular flow model it is concluded that the kiln from the industrial partner is probably not in rolling mode. This hints the possibility that there is a non-optimized mixing in the kiln which could bring adverse consequences in the production and current modelling of the studied rotary kiln. A validated one-dimensional rotary kiln model is developed taking into account different approaches from literature. Simplified sintering reactions are proposed by considering experimental X-Ray Diffraction data. The one-dimensional model is successfully used to describe the properties of the product when changing <b>air</b> to <b>gas</b> <b>ratio</b> of the combustion gasses in the kiln from the industrial partner. Furthermore, a two-dimensional transversal model for granular bed heat transfer is developed to explore whether a full granular flow model is necessary {{in order to have a}} sufficiently accurate description of the granular material properties of the kiln from the industrial partner. It is concluded that due to the low loading of the analyzed CAC kiln, a one-dimensional is sufficient to make a sensitivity analysis on the operating conditions and design varaibles of the kiln if the bed has a rolling mode with an active layer of 5 to 20 percent of the bed height. Further research must be done in order to characterize the transversal flow of the analyzed kiln in order to develop more complex kiln models.

The flameholders used for these experiments were 1 / 4 inch diameter water cooled cylinders tested in a 1 by 4 inch combustion chamber. Stability limits, flame geometry, and relative combustion efficiency were determined as functions of flameholder spacing and number. The results of the tests showed that the maximum blowoff velocity decreased {{as the number of}} flameholders increased. This reduction was primarily due to the increase in the blockage ratio. In addition, a reduction in maximum blowoff velocity occurred when the flameholders were moved from the symmetrical arrangement in the duct. A combustion instability characterized by a loud, high frequency noise occurred over well defined ranges of fuel <b>air</b> <b>ratio,</b> <b>gas</b> velocity, and flameholder spacing.

40|$|AbstractPerformed {{investigation}} of pulverized fuel combustion in swirl flows {{has shown that}} there are two important groups of influential parameters: fuel and burner characteristics. The most important conclusion of these investigations is that each type of fuel needs a defined burner for its combustion and concrete operating parameters for its optimal work. Optimal operating parameters can be determined only by performing the appropriate experiments. Selection of optimal swirl burner design is dependent on energy loss which is used for air transport through burner. Increasing of swirl intensity is convenient for fuel ignition and flame stability, but energy loss for air transport increases, too. Swirl economy is estimated using hydraulic resistance parameter which represents energy loss due to swirling. In the paper are presented the methods and experimental data of hydraulic resistance determination for three laboratory models of swirl burners for pulverized fuel combustion. In the tangential burner the swirling is accomplished by tangential inflow of secondary air and fuel/air mixture. Axial-blade burner of type 1 enables swirling by a set of 18 blades.

40|$|ABSTRACT When {{the coal}} mine fire occurs, {{it is crucial}} to judge the fire {{combustion}} state by analyzing indicator gases concentration and changing trends of various <b>gas</b> <b>ratios</b> in order to formulate proper rescue measures. It's an effective methodology to estimate the changes of combustion state in coal mine fire accurately by the trends analysis of indicator <b>gases</b> and <b>gas</b> <b>ratios</b> independent of the external environment disturbs, such as air leakage and inner gases injection. However, there are few experimental researches about the changing rules of indicator <b>gases</b> and <b>gas</b> <b>ratios</b> at different combustion phases at present. Therefore, this paper has established a small-sized coal combustion experimental platform in confined space, on which the experimental studies on variation trends about indicator <b>gases</b> and <b>gas</b> <b>ratios</b> of the whole combustion phases are conducted. The experiment results have shown that the coal combustion trends could be accurately estimated by analyzing the relationship between indicator <b>gases</b> and <b>gas</b> <b>ratios</b> among different combustion phases.

Even though the main objective of the power plant is to meet the increasing power demand at low cost, still it is behind the expectations due to low reliability of the power plant. Failures in the boiler side equipment have been considerably responsible for this with a huge financial loss to the country. This project studies the suitable designs for design faults and shortcomings of LVPS to improve {{the reliability of the}} power plant related to the boiler side. By analyzing the past data until the first overhaul of the power plant, it is revealed that the main failures are arisen in the <b>primary</b> <b>air</b> system, coal pulverizing system, secondary <b>air</b> and flue <b>gas</b> systems related to the boiler side. In addition to the low reliability of <b>primary</b> <b>air</b> system, it is not supplying the required total amount of <b>primary</b> <b>air</b> to the system to run the pulverizers within the safe margins.

Extremely high quality graphene growth is possible at high temperatures using chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Use of an inductively coupled plasma chemical vapor deposition (ICP CVD) reactor {{with the benefit of}} precursor gas decomposition through plasma generation, may provide possibility to reduce growth temperature. Herein, we report plasma’s effects on graphene growth by comparing growths of increasing power supplied to plasma generation and changes in precursor <b>gas</b> <b>ratios.</b> Plasma composition was characterized by ultraviolet and visible light spectroscopy; graphene was characterized by Raman spectroscopy. Plasma was observed to change gradually and in a threshold shift. Gradual changes in plasma resulted in changes in graphene quality, both defect density and number of layers. The shift produced sudden changes in graphene quality. Further, increasing power before and after the shift produced opposite correlated trends. Finally, reduced hydrogen to acetylene <b>gas</b> <b>ratios</b> produced plasma associated with higher powers at a higher <b>gas</b> <b>ratio.</b> Though the comparative plasma spectra between the two reduced <b>gas</b> <b>ratio</b> growths were very similar, the quality of graphene was different.

Venturi tube had been successfully used to measure the flow of air.

50|$|Streaming instabilities {{form when}} the solid {{particles}} are moderately coupled to the gas, with Stokes numbers of 0.01 - 3; the local solid to <b>gas</b> <b>ratio</b> is near or larger than 1; and the vertically integrated solid to <b>gas</b> <b>ratio</b> {{is a few}} times Solar. The Stokes number {{is a measure of}} the relative influences of inertia and gas drag on a particle's motion. In this context it is the product of the timescale for the exponential decay of a particle's velocity due to drag and the angular frequency of its orbit. Small particles like dust are strongly coupled and move with the gas, large bodies such as planetesimals are weakly coupled and orbit largely unaffected by the gas. Moderately coupled solids, sometimes referred to as pebbles, range from roughly cm- to m-sized at asteroid belt distances and from mm- to dm-sized beyond 10 AU. These objects orbit through the gas like planetesimals but are slowed due to the headwind and undergo significant radial drift. The moderately coupled solids that participate in streaming instabilities are those dynamically affected by changes in the motions of gas on scales similar to those of the Coriolis effect, allowing them to be captured by regions of high pressure in a rotating disk. Moderately coupled solids also retain influence on the motion of the gas. If the local solid to <b>gas</b> <b>ratio</b> is near or above 1, this influence is strong enough to reinforce regions of high pressure and to increase the orbital velocity of the gas and slow radial drift. Reaching and maintaining this local solid to gas at the mid-plane requires an average solid to <b>gas</b> <b>ratio</b> in a vertical cross section of the disk that is a few times solar. When the average solid to <b>gas</b> <b>ratio</b> is 0.01, roughly that estimated from measurements of the current Solar System, turbulence at the mid-plane generates a wavelike pattern that puffs up the mid-plane layer of solids. This reduces the solid to <b>gas</b> <b>ratio</b> at the mid-plane to less than 1, suppressing the formation of dense clumps. At higher average solid to <b>gas</b> <b>ratios</b> the mass of solids dampens this turbulence allowing a thin mid-plane layer to form. Stars with higher metallicities are more likely to reach the minimum solid to <b>gas</b> <b>ratio</b> making them favorable locations for planetesimal and planet formation.|$|R
