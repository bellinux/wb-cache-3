25|$|During the Delhi Sultanate, {{there was}} a {{synthesis}} between Indian civilization and Islamic civilization. The latter was a cosmopolitan civilization, with a multicultural and <b>pluralistic</b> <b>society,</b> and wide-ranging international networks, including social and economic networks, spanning large parts of Afro-Eurasia, leading to escalating circulation of goods, peoples, technologies and ideas. While initially disruptive due to the passing of power from native Indian elites to Turkic Muslim elites, the Delhi Sultanate was responsible for integrating the Indian subcontinent into a growing world system, drawing India into a wider international network, which {{had a significant impact}} on Indian culture and society.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Contemporary {{liberal democracies}} contain {{multiple}} cultural, religious, and philosophical traditions. Within these societies, different interpretive communities provide divergent models for understanding health, illness, and moral obligations. Bioethicists commonly draw upon models of moral reasoning that presume {{the existence of}} shared moral intuitions. Principlist bioethics, case-based models of moral deliberation, intuitionist frameworks, and cost-benefit analyses all emphasise the uniformity of moral reasoning. However, religious and cultural differences challenge assumptions about common modes of moral deliberation. Too often, bioethicists minimize or ignore the existence of multiple traditions of moral inquiry. Careful consideration {{of the presence of}} multiple horizons for moral deliberation generates challenging questions about the capacity of bioethicists to effectively resolve complex cases and social policy disputes. Key words: bioethics, cultural models, moral reasoning, <b>pluralistic</b> <b>societies</b> Introduction: Bioethics in <b>pluralistic</b> <b>societies</b> When bioethics emerged as a disciplinary crossroads in the late 1960 s and 1970 s, philosophers, theolo-gians, and legal scholars commonly neglected the challenges to normative deliberation posed by multi...|$|R
25|$|The {{pressures}} of indigenization {{and the growing}} acceptance of a unique Taiwanese cultural identity have met opposition from more conservative elements of Taiwan society. Critics argue that the new perspective creates a “false” identity rooted in ethnic nationalism {{as opposed to an}} “authentic” Chinese identity, which is primordial and inherent. Many mainlanders living on Taiwan complain that their own culture is marginalized by bentuhua, and initially expressed fear of facing growing alienation. In the past decade these complaints have subsided somewhat as Taiwan increasingly views itself as a <b>pluralistic</b> <b>society</b> that embraces many cultures and recognizes the rights of all citizens.|$|E
25|$|Before {{and during}} the Delhi Sultanate, Islamic civilization was the most {{cosmopolitan}} civilization of the Middle Ages.

25|$|Feyerabend {{described}} {{science as}} being essentially anarchistic, obsessed {{with its own}} mythology, and as making claims to truth well beyond its actual capacity. He was especially indignant about the condescending attitudes of many scientists towards alternative traditions. For example, he thought that negative opinions about astrology and the effectivity of rain dances were not justified by scientific research, and dismissed the predominantly negative attitudes of scientists towards such phenomena as elitist or racist. In his opinion, science has become a repressing ideology, even though it arguably started as a liberating movement. Feyerabend thought that a <b>pluralistic</b> <b>society</b> should be protected from being influenced too much by science, {{just as it is}} protected from other ideologies.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} of the English Revolution Helwys' stance on {{religious}} toleration was more commonplace. However, whilst accepting their zeal in desiring a 'godly society', some contemporary historians doubt whether the English Puritans during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey's recent work emphasises the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for heresy, blasphemy, Catholicism, non-Christian religions, and even atheism. This minority included the Seekers, as well as the General Baptists and the Levellers. Their collective witness demanded the church be an entirely voluntary, non-coercive community able to evangelise in a <b>pluralistic</b> <b>society</b> governed by a purely civil state. Such a demand was {{in sharp contrast to the}} ambitions of the magisterial Protestantism of the Calvinist majority.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} reforms were also {{carried out to}} the armed forces, as characterised by a {{reduction}} in basic military training from 18 to 15 months, a reorganisation of education and training, and personnel and procurement procedures. Education for the troops was improved, a personnel reshuffle of top management in the Bundeswehr was carried out, academic education was mandated for officers beyond their basic military training, and a new recruiting policy for Bundeswehr personnel was introduced {{with the intention of}} building an army that reflected West Germany’s <b>pluralistic</b> <b>society.</b> Defense Minister Helmut Schmidt led the development of the first Joint Service Regulation ZDv 10/1 (Assistance for Innere Fuehrung, classified: restricted), which revitalized the concept of Innere Fuehrung while also affirming the value of the “citizen in uniform.” According to one study, {{as a result of this}} reform, “a strong civil mindset displaced the formerly dominant military mindset,” and forced the Bundeswehr’s elder generation to accept a new type of soldier envisioned by Schmidt. In addition, the Federal Cost of Moving Act increased the relocation allowance (with effect from 1 November 1973), with the basic allowances raised by DM 50 and DM 100 respectively, while extra allowances for families were raised to a uniform amount of 125 DM.|$|E

30|$|Let me {{reiterate}} that, normatively, I favor {{a welfare}} state that produces greater economic equality and a multicultural, liberal nationalism that generates inclusive membership in <b>pluralistic</b> <b>societies.</b> Empirically, I {{agree that there}} is no strong evidence for a multiculturalism/ redistribution trade-off, and that Canada, in particular, is a positive example of multicultural nationalism, though perhaps less a prime example of a generous redistributive welfare state. Undoubtedly, however, my views – and those of Will Kymlicka (2015), − have been influenced by living in and studying Canada. Perhaps our understanding of the problem and view of the solution are both biased by these experiences.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2005. Peace within <b>pluralistic</b> <b>societies</b> {{requires}} citizens {{capable of}} {{and committed to}} engaging non-violently in conflicts that will invariably arise {{due to differences in}} the interests, values, and commitments of diverse individuals and groups. Citizenship and peace educators suggest that this capacity can be cultivated by engaging students in a process of intergroup dialogue. In this qualitative case study, I investigated how a group of twenty-two Protestant and Catholic students in Northern Ireland participated in a series of dialogues concerning questions of national and cultural identity. Employing an ethnographic approach, I collected data by means of participant observation, interviews with students and staff, and document analysis. Data were analyzed according to a constant comparative process (Glaser & Strauss, 1967) and a participant feedback procedure (Bibace et al, 1999) was used to strengthen the accuracy and representativeness of my findings. Throughout the four-month program, students employed a variety of response strategies through which they consistently minimized the controversial nature of knowledge or value claims presented by others. Through the use of demystification and liminal subject matters, program staff occasionally succeeded in sustaining students' consideration of perspectives that challenged their own and initiating critical reflection concerning students' assumptions, behaviors, and commitments. I discuss what this case reveals about how dialogue can be employed to educate citizens capable of and committed to promoting peace and democracy in <b>pluralistic</b> <b>societies...</b>|$|R
40|$|Hermeneutics {{deals with}} the {{question}} of understanding that implies the recognition of the otherness. Cultural pluralism emphasizes the tension between what is one’s own and what is alien. It generates conflicts that have consequences within the legal and political organization. Law assumes the task of regulating these conflicts and the engagement in accommodating diversity through a culture-sensitive adjudication. This concerns the possibility of building a legality that may be more open to interaction between culturally different identities. In <b>pluralistic</b> <b>societies</b> the process of realization of law requires dialogical confrontation. Cross-cultural dialogue is essential in increasing habits of living together and arguing together in a self-reflective manner...|$|R
