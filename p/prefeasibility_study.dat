Here, just three areas of mainly technical {{risk and uncertainty}} are discussed relating to technology integration, to IGCC site choice and infrastructure and to GHG storage. Technology integration risks and uncertainties are managed primarily through carefully designed agreement structures and close-in ZeroGen engagements which enable very early information sharing, collaboration and integration between technology providers especially on mass and heat balance issues. Site choice and infrastructure are managed first by a critical technical assurance test on coal quality, followed ranking of differential NPV vs. site-specific non-financial risks using multi-criteria analysis. A distinction {{is made in the}} type and level of cost, risk and uncertainty in maturing a storage resource i. e. between lower cost, higher uncertainty storage and higher cost, relatively lower risk and uncertainty plant. For the former, the main focus is the definition and quantification of uncertainty. In the latter, risk and uncertainty reduction are the focuses and are more amenable to creative engineered and commercial solutions. This higher implicit uncertainty at the relatively low cost side of the project may lead to the development of stage gate “tests“based on confidence levels in required storage performance prior to making larger plant investment decisions...|$|R

Results of <b>prefeasibility</b> <b>studies</b> for specific projects suggest that they are both financially and technically viable. Because of low labor costs and favorable climate biomass can be grown on marginal and underutilized land and converted to electricity at costs lower than other alternatives. Bases on current plantation establishment rates, the potential size of the biomass resource can easily support over 1 GW of electric generating capacity in small-sized (up to 20 - 40 MW) cogeneration and stand-alone projects. These projects, if implemented, can ease power shortages, reduce unemployment, and help sustain the region`s economic growth. Moreover, the external environmental benefits of biomass energy are also potentially significant.

Three techniques were developed in this research effort to estimate the investment costs of a reservoir project, a levee project, and a basin conservation reservoir project in an economic region. The application of the methodologies were illustrated by a case study. The cost of a reservoir project in the case study area determined by the method developed in this investigation was in excellent agreement with the Corps of Engineers' estimate using conventional methods. In general, the dependability of all the three methodologies were considered good for use in order-ofmagnitude estimates. Selected solutions for water resources development problems in the Navasota River watershed were analyzed. The cost of water supply by desalination in the service area of the proposed Millican reservoir was computed following the procedure recommended by the Office of Saline Water. The investment costs of the alternatives were compared. The multipurpose reservoir project for flood control, water supply and recreation was found to be the least costly project. However, levees for flood protection in the lower Brazos River basin and desalting for water supply appeared to possess more intangible environmental benefits although the estimated cost of this multipurpose alternative was somewhat higher in comparison to the multipurpose reservoir project. Evaluation of intangible cost factors (environmental, aesthetic, etc.) was not possible in want of scientifically amenable procedures. Total costs (combined tangible and intangible factors) of all alternative plans could not be estimated.

40|$|Integrated carbon‐to‐liquids {{technology}} (ICTL) incorporates {{three basic}} processes for {{the conversion of}} a wide range of feedstocks to distillate liquid fuels: (1) Direct Microcatalytic Coal Liquefaction (MCL) is coupled with biomass liquefaction via (2) Catalytic Hydrodeoxygenation and Isomerization (CHI) of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) or trigylceride fatty acids (TGFA) to produce liquid fuels, with process derived (3) CO{sub 2 } Capture and Utilization (CCU) via algae production and use in BioFertilizer for added terrestrial sequestration of CO{sub 2 }, or as a feedstock for MCL and/or CHI. This novel approach enables synthetic fuels production while simultaneously meeting EISA 2007 Section 526 targets, minimizing land use and water consumption, and providing cost competitive fuels at current day petroleum prices. ICTL was demonstrated with Montana Crow sub‐bituminous coal in MCL pilot scale operations at the Energy and Environmental Research Center at the University of North Dakota (EERC), with related pilot scale CHI studies conducted at the University of Pittsburgh Applied Research Center (PARC). Coal‐Biomass to Liquid (CBTL) Fuel samples were evaluated at the US Air Force Research Labs (AFRL) in Dayton and greenhouse tests of algae based BioFertilizer conducted at Montana State University (MSU). Econometric modeling studies were also conducted on the use of algae based BioFertilizer in a wheat‐camelina crop rotation cycle. We find that the combined operation is not only able to help boost crop yields, but also to provide added crop yields and associated profits from TGFA (from crop production) for use an ICTL plant feedstock. This program demonstrated the overall viability of ICTL in pilot scale operations. Related work on the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of a Montana project indicated that CCU could be employed very effectively to reduce the overall carbon footprint of the MCL/CHI process. Plans are currently being made to conduct larger‐scale process demonstration studies of the CHI process in combination with CCU to generate synthetic jet and diesel fuels from algae and algae fertilized crops.

40|$|In {{large scale}} metalliferous mining, there is {{documented}} evidence that by providing an appropriate size distribution to {{crushing and grinding}} circuits, a measurable increased throughput and/or reduced power draw can be obtained. Tailoring blast designs to suit specific fragmentation requirements is becoming common place at both the <b>prefeasibility</b> and feasibility <b>study</b> stages. This is particularly the case when significant increases in ore production rates are being considered. Given the variability associated {{with many of the}} input parameters that are used to estimate fragmentation outcomes, a simple deterministic empirical approach is limited. This is the case at the feasibility stages, where there is a higher degree of uncertainty in the definition of blasting domains. Complex processes, such as explosive rock breakage and fragmentation, are suited to modelling techniques involving stochastic methods. As part of the feasibility study of a large open pit expansion project, there was a requirement to estimate fragmentation envelopes for a set of design parameters and rock mass conditions. This paper gives a description of a stochastic approach to blast fragmentation modelling and uses this expansion project to demonstrate its application. In this particular case study, there was a need to estimate the expected run of mine fragmentation associated with blasting in the deeper and more competent ore domains. Results from several simulations using the proposed modelling approach have shown the importance of including the measured variability of input parameters such intact rock properties and degree of fracturing at the feasibility stages. Modelling results also identified significant differences in ore fragmentation envelopes if current designs were to be applied in the more competent domains as the pit expands. From this analysis, a number of blast design options have been evaluated and recommendations made in order to achieve future ore handling and processing targets. © 2010 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining Published by Maney on behalf of the Institute and The AusIM...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION In a {{situation}} when government expenditures for defense are more restrictive, any {{investment in the}} acquisition of arms and military equipment (AME) {{is a question that}} does not allow errors in decisions. Accordingly, the economic analysis of the investment must be detailed and unavoidable. In the past, the initial cost of procurement of AME was often the primary, and sometimes the only one criterion in decision-making. Neglecting the analysis of costs throughout the life of assets in <b>prefeasibility</b> <b>studies</b> is the main cause of unplanned investment in the later stages of the life cycle of investment, and also of a number of problems in the functioning and unfulfilling or partially fulfilling the goals of the system. PROCESS OF EQUIPPING THE MoD AND THE SAF WITH AME Legislation governing the process of equipping the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and the Serbian Armed Forces (SAF) with AME is based on the Regulation on equipping the Yugoslav Army with weapons and military equipment in peacetime, from 1996, and on several Standards of National Defense (SNO 0477 / 83, SNO 1096 / 85, SNO 8196 / 92, SNO 9000 / 97, etc.). Due to a number of social and organizational changes in the defense system, this regulation is not in full compliance with real-time requirements. The analysis of legal regulations and activities in the process of equipping the MoD and the SAF with AME in practice indicates dominance of technical - technological aspects of the equipping analysis, while the economic aspect (primarily aspect of costs) is present, but not detailed enough. At best, there is only a static approach to the analysis and evaluation of investment projects, while a dynamic aspect and the aspect of the total cost over the life of assets are not taken into account. ANALYSIS OF COSTS IN THE LIFETIME OF ASSETS Given the non-profit character of military organizations and the possibility to express explicit costs, but not the benefits of investment in equipping with AME, costs {{are one of the most}} dominant parameters in decision-making. Modern trends in this area comprehensively perceive all costs during the life cycle of assets. In general, in the analysis of costs in the life cycle of AME there are two sets of costs: visible and invisible (hidden) costs. The visible part of the costs is mainly present in decision-making and usually includes the cost of equipping units or purchase of assets. The invisible part of the costs is far more significant. Although it is larger than the visible part and covers more groups of costs, decision-makers often do not take it into account. The hidden costs include: distribution costs, operating costs, maintenance costs, training costs, inventory costs, information systems costs, the cost of disposal and write-offs, etc. The decision making problem about investment in the AME purchase and equipping is obviously of  multicriteria nature, whether an optimum combination of costs for one  technical system (AME) is in question, or whether it is a choice of a system of AME among many offered. COST ANALYSIS OF A PARTICULAR  ASSET For the illustration of an integrated approach to the analysis of the cost of assets in their life-cycle, a model from the US Naval Postgraduate School, was adjusted and applied on an example of a real asset. The model is applied to the case of two  squadrons of identical aircraft based at different airports. With regard to the availability, confidentiality, and the variability of costs and reliability of the elements of AME, the calculations in the model are implemented on the basis of the estimated or orientation parameters. Essentially, the goal is to demonstrate the interdependence, mutual relations and influences of parameters and their ultimate impact on the overall cost of military assets. Applying the model to a particular example points to the fact that, in the first years of asset life, the dominant cost is that of asset procurement (cost of acquisition, cost of assets themselves, the price of equipment for service and maintenance, the costs of initial training of a number of personnel and distribution costs). When assets are new and introduced gradually in phases within the warranty period, the costs of asset maintaining and upgrading are not significant at that period. During this period, the main costs are the costs of personnel and training. Maintenance costs increase over time, and at the half of the life cycle there are special investments in the development and modernization of equipment, as well as in testing the reliability of individual elements, etc [...] Due to years of use, the operating costs of assets grow until the expiration of their life cycle, when there is a possibility of selling them and achieving certain profit. When looking at how the dynamics of individual costs affect the overall cost of assets in their life cycle, it is evident that most of the percentage of costs are the costs of asset operating and maintaining - about 66 %. The costs of testing and training follow with 16 %, 12 % is attributed to personnel costs, 6 % to training costs, etc [...] CONTRIBUTION TO THE OPTIMIZATION OF FUNDS ALLOCATED TO AME PROCUREMENT In order to provide the necessary funds when they are needed and at optimal cost, it is necessary to carry out adequate strategic, managerial, operational and administrative activities. Strategic actions in defense systems, in this sense, include: planning and development of procurement organization and infrastructure, determination of the best use of expertise and procurement resources, identification of the working standards to be achieved, and the establishment of control and reporting mechanisms. Control activities are the identification of modes for the best satisfaction of perceived needs, planning and coordination in procurement, training and staff development as well as acquisition performance  measurement. Operational activities are demanding specifications, examining options of research of the supply of goods or services, bid and supplier evaluation, negotiations, as well as contract and project administration. Administrative activities include processing and dispatching orders, comparing delivery and receipt confirmations, invoice receipt and verification, record-keeping and others. The identified existing and potential failures occurring in the procurement of military assets and affecting the optimization of use of financial resources, include: lack of adequate staff, imprecise legal regulations of procurement, lack of multi-year framework agreements related to the acquisition, insufficient and inadequate market research, incomplete adherence to the existing norms, late placing of funds at the disposal of the procurement service, untimely and inaccurate procurement planning, poor quality technical documentation, disrespect for deadlines, inadequate frequency of purchases, a number of "urgent and confidential procurements,", absence of a system limiting the time of procurement activities, absence of an adequate structure to deal with procurement control, etc. In addition, an integrated information system or a database that would allow access to the data and the analysis of the dynamics of costs would ensure proper assessment of costs of investments in equipping the military with AME [...] CONCLUSION Determining AME  life cycle costs should be made at an early phase of asset development because it can repeatedly affect the total amount and cost reduction through project changing. In the cost analysis, it is desirable to use mathematical models and methods developed in the theory and practice to allow accurate calculations of the elements necessary for a cost estimate. The biggest costs occur in the functional competence of logistics which shows that equipping the army must be based on logistic grounds for efficiency and cost saving throughout the life cycle of the asset. The initial cost of assets in relation to the costs that appear at the end of their life cycle is only a few percent and all other expenses are related to support costs. All presented elements are necessary to be analyzed through the existing organization of the military and the logistic support system, because deviations or adjustments to specific operating conditions can bring significant cost saving as well. Due to the multi-disciplinary and multi-criteria character of the process of equipping the military with AME, it is necessary to form project teams that will adequately manage the process. When the equipping is of strategic importance for the country, it is necessary that the Government and relevant ministries  take an adequate role in the process. An integrated approach to the budget and the reduction of AME life cycle costs should follow the general trends in the reform of public (state) sector such as: cost and efficiency optimization, team approach to solving complex problems, greater transparency, shorter response time, introduction of a labor-incentive system, reducing administration, public-private partnerships and multinational projects. The aim is to provide a better solution, product or service or a higher level of satisfaction of the public (state) interests with lower consumption of resources. In the defense sector, this means sustainable and smart defense and multinational approach in the implementation of costly projects. In order to optimize the AME life cycle costs, it is necessary, at all levels of study and training of personnel, to study certain features of integrated logistic support, to apply proper concepts and approaches and to predict and monitor organizational and technological changes in the defense system.  </p...|$|R
40|$|Bhutan {{is a small}} Buddhist country nested in the cradles of {{the eastern}} Himalayas. It has rugged mountainous terrains with altitudes ranging from 500 masl in its {{southern}} plains to 4500 masl in the snowy capped mountains in north. This rugged mountainous topography blessed Bhutan with huge hydropower potential. The hydropower potential of Bhutan is estimated at 30000 MW with projects above 10 MW capacity as per the power system master plan. This {{is one of the}} highest in the world considering its small size. In absence of other valuable natural resources, hydropower has become the main national resources in the country. Out of huge potential, Bhutan today has 1488 MW of installed hydropower project under generation illuminating about 90 % of all houses in the country and feeding power to its developing industries. Because of its small size and even smaller population, the internal electricity consumption of Bhutan is small roughly 30 % of its present generation. The balance power is exported to India generating the most needed revenue for the economic development of the country. Bhutan plan to construct 10000 MW of hydropower projects within year 2020 among which some mega projects are already under construction. Bhutan being located in the tectonically active Himalayan geological formation faces lots of geological challenges in tunneling works. The Himalayan geology intruded by numerous geological discontinuities, and frequented by the tectonic activities poses lots of challenges for tunneling works. The Himalayan geology is very complex and rock mass properties changes greatly within small distances. The engineering geological investigation for an underground work is very important. Detailed investigation is important during the <b>prefeasibility</b> and feasibility <b>study</b> stage of the project. But the availability of funds and time are the constraining factor in performing detailed engineering geological investigations. Balance need to be made to cover most important geotechnical studies within the availability time and fund to get a reliable design. Punatsangchu II hydropower project is a runoff river scheme project being constructed along this river basin in central western part of Bhutan. In this thesis, the engineering geological study of the HRT was carried out with an aim to carry out stability assessment and support requirement for HRT. The engineering properties of the rock mass along the HRT are reviewed from the stability aspect with discussion on orientation of main foliation, joints and weakness zones with the tunnel alignment. An alternate alignment is proposed, optimizing on orientation of main foliation, shear zones and main jointing with the tunnel alignment, restricting the exercise within the same limits of the start and end point of the HRT as given in designed layout. It has been found that the topography along the HRT permits very limited alternatives for the tunnel alignment layout and the location of construction adits. The main foliation and joint orientations were taken care for the tunnel alignment. However, there are some rooms for optimization within the same limits, if taken care of could bring better benefit to the project. This possible optimization was used in the proposed alternate alignment. The rock mass characteristics and possible instability problems along the HRT alignment were also reviewed in stability study. There are very less possibility of squeezing problems along the tunnel alignment but minor instability problems could not be fully ruled out due to the low rock mass strength. With the tunnel alignment crossing two nalas, some minor seepage problems were also expected at those nala crossing areas. Possible solutions for instability and seepage problems were also recommended in the relevant cases. The NGIs Q method and Bieniawskis RMR methods were used for the rock mass classification and the support design thereof. The designed rock supports are cross checked with the standards NGIs support chart and Bieniawskis RMR guide charts. It is found that a typical conservative support approach practiced in the Indian sub continent is followed for the support system. The supports designed were on much conservative side compared with support requirement from Q support charts. Finally the supports were further checked by using Phase 2 numerical modeling. The result of the numerical analysis suggests lighter supports compared with the designed support for the HRT. The adoption of the conservative methods may keep the instability problems at bay, but the cost affect can be on the higher especially when the projects suffer from fund availability. </p...|$|R
30|$|The minimum {{guarantee}} {{of water to}} Bangladesh ensured in 1977 agreement was removed in the MoU signed in 1982. It recognized that the basic problem of inadequate flow of water in Ganges available at Farakka imposed concessions on both the countries. It agreed that long term solution lay in increase of flow at Farakka. It was decided that JRC would complete the economic and technical <b>prefeasibility</b> <b>study</b> of schemes of either side after which the two governments would implement the augmentation proposals. As a result, a temporary measure of water sharing schedule was agreed upon (India–Bangladesh Water Sharing Agreement 1982). The 1982 MoU continued until 1984 and another MoU was signed in 1985.|$|E
