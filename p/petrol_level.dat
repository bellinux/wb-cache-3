40|$|Petrol Monitoring System in Storage Tank (PMSST) is {{developed}} to facilitate manager and staff of Trident Bliss Sdn. Bhd. This system can help and easily the manager, supervisor and staff {{to monitor the}} <b>petrol</b> <b>level</b> remain in the storage tank at petrol station. In the existing system, process of collecting volume of <b>petrol</b> <b>level</b> in storage tank is conducted manually by using fuel tank dipstick. The processes call dipping. Therefore, the proposed system {{is to change the}} current process to computerized system that connected to ultrasonic censor. The methodology that has been applied in the project development is the Prototype model. The advantage of prototype model is it can be early act or representation of the final product and this method can reduce risk and limit expenses and costs. In the development of PMSST, Visual Studio 2010 and Microsoft access 2010 has been used as programming tools while Arduino Uno R 3 with Ultrasonic Module HC-SR 04 Distance Measuring as hardware tools. Visual Studio {{has become one of the}} world’s most widely used programming languages while Microsoft access 2010 is an open source relational database management system. Arduino Uno R 3 is an open-source physical computing platform based on a simple i/o board and development that implements the processing/wiring language Ultrasonic Module HC-SR 04 Distance Measuring provide noncontact measurement function includes ultrasonic transmitters, receiver and control circuit. As a result, form system {{is developed}} and this system helps to simplify and efficiently used of monitoring remaining petrol activity...|$|E
40|$|We propose here {{a liquid}} level sensor using a long period fiber grating (LPFG) in which direct liquid level {{measurement}} is carried out by utilising an LPFG, 100 mm in length and a periodicity of 1 mm. The LPFG was exposed to liquids with varying levels and the wavelength shift of a selected loss band of the transmission spectra was monitored using a broadband light source and an optical spectrum analyzer. The mechanism of this LPFG sensor {{is based on the}} fact that the effective Refractive Index (RI) of a cladding mode is directly dependant on the RI of the surrounding medium, be it air, or in this case water and petrol. As the surrounding RI changes, so does the phase matching condition of the LPFG. The result for the level change of the liquid with a specific RI is both a shift in wavelength and a change in the attenuation level of the selected loss band. For the selected loss band, continuous wavelength shifts of 9. 5 nm and 25 nm for 100 mm of water and <b>petrol</b> <b>level</b> change have been observed respectively, with sub-millimetre accuracy...|$|E
50|$|The {{rear window}} of the coupé is {{reminiscent}} of the older Honda CR-X from the early 1990s, as well as the last three-door Mazda 323C. These two versions of the C4 Picasso are more detached, taking over the grille of the sedan and coupe, but the cut of the headlamps are different, aesthetically combining corners and curves. The rear lights incorporate the design as in those of the sedan, but were adapted to the different shape of the body. Internally, the dashboard features a central instrument panel that centralizes all heating and cooling controls, audio, and a satellite navigation screen. The instrument panel contains digital and analog displays of the speedometer, <b>petrol</b> <b>levels,</b> and other gauges. Lighting can be customised to change colour from white to blue.|$|R
40|$|Petrol {{stations}} in Saudi Arabia {{are considered the}} lifeline of transportation in the Kingdom because {{the only means of}} transportation is either through the use of cars or buses. The major petroleum products to refuel vehicles in Saudi Arabia are petrol and diesel, pinpointing the importance of petrol {{stations in}} Saudi Arabia. However, Saudi Arabian petrol stations experience petrol delays and poor service quality. In addition, Saudi Arabian petrol stations utilise traditional petrol operational processes that include manually measuring <b>petrol</b> <b>levels</b> in tanks, testing for leaks and book-based accounting processes to minimise cost And Increase profit. Moreover, considering that approximately 90 % of Saudi Arabian petrol stations are operated and managed by individuals, either locals or expatriates, this intensity to compete causes serious problems such as mixing petrol products to reduce petrol prices and thus, attract customers; defrauding petrol pump meters; wasting petroleum resources; and, petrol smuggling to nearby countries, leading to a shortage in petrol products in the domestic market. On the basis of the literature reviewed, this is considered as a source of uncertainty and quality problems that will consequently impact budgets and schedules. Hence, this study diagnoses and explores the key factors that influence the Saudi Arabian petrol supply chain to answer the research question, &lsquo;how do the technological, organisational and environmental aspects of the Saudi Arabian petroleum industry impact on petroleum supply chain integration?&rsquo...|$|R
40|$|Twenty-two {{volatile}} {{aromatic hydrocarbons}} were determined {{in the air}} of an automobile during commuting. Sampling was made on Tenax cartridges and laboratory determinations were carried out using thermal desorption combined with temperature-programmed capillary gas chromatography. Selected hydrocarbons representative of petrol exhaust were determined in the automobile and in an electric commuter train during eight parallel commuter trips. In the automobile, the concentrations of benzene were 35 - 70 micrograms/m 3 and those of total aromatic hydrocarbons 200 - 400 micrograms/m 3. The <b>petrol</b> exhaust <b>levels</b> were 5 - 10 times higher in the automobile than in the compartment of the commuter train...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the asymmetries in {{the response}} of petrol prices to oil price shocks. We show that previous work, based on the determination of asymmetric responses, can be improved upon by allowing for asymmetries in short term dynamics. The paper shows that a significant determinant of {{the response of}} petrol prices to oil price changes, {{is the extent to}} which petrol price can be seen to have departed from its long run equilibrium <b>level.</b> <b>Petrol</b> Price, Oil Prices, Asymmetric Adjustment, Non-Linearity, Cointegration,...|$|R
5000|$|Four {{grades of}} petrol are {{commonly}} sold in Singapore. Diesel and unleaded <b>petrol</b> with octane <b>levels</b> of 92, 95 and 98 are widely sold. Octane levels conform with European octane ratings and roughly correspond to American octane levels of 87, 90, and 93, respectively. Shell also market a fifth brand of fuel under the V-Power label, {{in addition to}} 98 octane petrol. 98 octane V-Power is marketed as having an FMT additive and [...] "formulated to improve performance and responsiveness", and sells for approximately 15 cents per litre more than Shell's other 98 octane fuel.|$|R
30|$|Hence, the ill-advised {{unilateral}} {{focus of}} European regulation on CO 2 with low emphasis on toxic emissions {{as compared to}} US or Japanese legislation cannot be blamed alone at stakeholders at the European level. The European Commission launched another attempt to align fuel taxes in 2011. With the revision of the Energy Taxation Directive, the Commission's proposal again was to tax fuels in a neutral way and to ensure a fair competition in the internal market. All fuels would compete {{on the basis of}} their carbon content instead of tax advantages. Even the proposal expressively ‘did not seek to penalize diesel but to tax fuels in a neutral way {{on the basis of their}} merits instead of tax advantages’ (EU Taxation Commissioner Algirdas Šemeta in[114]), it resulted in shifting the litre price level of diesel above the <b>petrol</b> price <b>level</b> according to the higher energy content of the former. Very generous transitional periods until 2023 were thus scheduled to make such a move acceptable. However, still the proposal was going to meet strong resistance in the European Parliament and in different Member States.|$|R
40|$|The {{detrimental}} effects of low-level lead loads on the cognitive function of young chil-dren are now well accepted. Most such {{studies have been}} carried out in western coun-tries, and there is as yet little information from less developed areas on the environ-mental impact of lead or on its role in furthering disadvantage in childhood. In such countries, the small, but significant, lead effect on intelligence may well be additive to other harmful factors- low birth weight, repeated infections, suboptimal nutrition, emotional deprivation and poor intellectual stimulation. In Southern Africa leaded gasoline is still the only form available. The recent lowering of <b>petrol</b> lead <b>levels</b> has provided the opportunity to assess its contribution to lead load. The results of pre-vious studies on Cape preschool children and teenagers are briefly reviewed. Two fur-ther studies on children attending primary schools are reported. The first compared blood lead levels in children from inner city Cape Town schools before, and some years after, petrol lead was lowered. The second compared groups living in three deep rural villages, one of which is involved in lead mining. Mean blood lead levels in all groups were above internationally accepted standards, and levels in the rural chil-dren were surprisingly high...|$|R
2500|$|The {{experiments}} {{show that}} water in fuel ethanol inhibits dry corrosion. At 10,000 ppm {{water in the}} E50 experiments by JARI and 3,500 ppm water in the E20 experiments by TU Darmstadt [...] the alcoholate/alkoxide corrosion stopped. In the fuel ethanol this resembles 20,000 ppm or 2 volume% {{in the case of}} JARI and 5 x 3500 = 17,500 ppm of 1.75 volume% in the case of TU Darmstadt. The observations are in line with the fact that hydrous ethanol is known for being less corrosive than anhydrous ethanol. The reaction mechanism will be the same at lower-mid blends. When enough water is present in the fuel, the aluminum will react preferably with water to produce aluminum oxide, repairing the protective aluminum oxide layer, which is why the corrosion stops. The aluminum alcoholate/alkoxide does not make a tight oxide layer, which is why the corrosion continues. In other words, water is essential to repair the holes in the oxide layer. Based on the Japanese/German results, a minimum of 2 vol.% or 2.52% m/m water is currently proposed in the revision of the hydrous ethanol specification for blending in <b>petrol</b> at E10+ <b>levels.</b> Water injection has additional positive effects on the engine performance (thermodynamic efficiency) and reduces overall CO2 emissions.|$|R
