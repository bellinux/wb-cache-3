In one method, parallel pin pairs are {{inserted in the}} distal and proximal bone segment using a drill guide. After osteotomy, the pin pairs are inserted into a reduction guide to achieve reduction [10]. Other techniques use drilling and cutting guides to <b>predrill</b> holes for subsequent fixation using standard osteosynthesis material [11], or by using patient-specific fixation plates that provide accurate alignment of the bone segments [4, 12, 13].

The methods for pore pressure detection (the resistivity, sonic, and corrected d-exponent methods) are improved using the depth-dependent normal compaction equations {{to adapt to the}} requirements of the real-time monitoring. A new method is proposed to calculate pore pressure from the connection gas or elevated background gas, which can be used for real-time pore pressure detection. The pore pressure detection using the logging-while-drilling, measurement-while-drilling, and mud logging data is also implemented and evaluated. Abnormal pore pressure indicators from the well logs, mud logs, and wellbore instability events are identified and analyzed to interpret abnormal pore pressures for guiding real-time drilling decisions. The principles for identifying abnormal pressure indicators are proposed to improve real-time pore pressure monitoring...|$|E
30|$|The {{search for}} {{hydrocarbons}} has gone beyond shallow hydrostatic reservoirs, necessitating deep drilling beyond known depths in the mature Onshore Niger Delta fields. Often times, the challenge {{has been the}} ambiguity in pore pressure prediction beyond the shallow depths where disequilibrium compaction {{is no longer the}} active overpressure contributor. This leads to underbalanced drilling with the implication that well drilling is terminated at the occurrence of the first kick, before reaching the target depth. Thus, in this study, the dominant overpressure mechanism is determined by the analyses of velocity, density versus depth cross-plots. The Eaton empirical approach, equivalent depth method (EDM), a deterministic approach, and Bowers velocity–vertical effective stress (Vp–VES) relationship were applied to Vp-sonic log to compare prediction profiles. Pressure data were used to infer geologically consistent Eaton’s exponents and Vp–VES curve for loading and unloading scenarios. The results show that deeper than the approximately 11, 000 ft where unloading began, EDM and Eaton’s exponent of 3.0 would fail. However, higher exponents can be adopted for the area at onset of unloading temperatures ranging from 98 to 100  °C. The estimated shale pressure profile from the EDM, Eaton’s exponents and Vp–VES models accurately fit the measured pressure data. In that way, the uncertainty in the prediction can be quantified. Hence, <b>predrill</b> estimates of shale pressures can be generated beyond known depths since the model can be used to transform seismic velocity to formation pressure, thereby ensuring better anticipation of potential risks and cost-effective drilling.|$|E
40|$|Many fault bound traps are underfilled {{despite the}} top seal {{capacity}} being secure. The hydrocarbon sealing performance of faults themselves can be compromised either by mechanical or capillary process. Capillary {{process can be}} important either due to juxtaposition or to fine-grained clay or cataclastic material within the fault zone itself. There is debate about how important each of these mechanisms is over geological timescales of hydrocarbon trapping. Recent work has provided insights into fine-tuning capillary-related fault seal calibration methodologies. Over the last 15  years, vigorous scientific debate with multiple published laboratory experiments and modelling studies has led some researchers and industry technologists to theorise that for water-wet conventional hydrocarbon reservoirs, the relative water permeability in the reservoir (towards {{the top of the}} hydrocarbon column) may become very small, but in practice never reach zero. While not advocating for either side in this debate, the importance of accounting for hydrodynamic conditions regardless of the capillary sealing mechanism is demonstrated. Additionally, it is noted that nonzero relative water permeability has implications on how a seal 2 ̆ 7 s capillary threshold pressure for the nonwetting hydrocarbon phase is estimated from field data. In the particular case where there are pressure differences between unproduced hydrocarbon reservoirs on either side of a fault, then the hydrocarbon saturation must be discontinuous across the fault. For hydrocarbon leakage to occur across the entire thickness of the fault zone, the hydrocarbon pressure must exceed the threshold pressure {{on the side of the}} fault zone with the highest formation water hydraulic head. This approach to estimating across-fault pressure difference will result in an improved calibration data set used for <b>predrill</b> estimation of capillary fault seal capacity...|$|E

40|$|Relating seismic {{interpretation}} to reserve/resource calculations: Insights from a DHI consortium In {{the process of}} quantifying resources/reserves, geoscientists attempt to employ all the available pertinent information to produce the most accurate results. The presence of direct hydrocarbon indicators (DHI) on seismic data can {{have a significant impact}} on the reserve/resource calculations not only for volumes, but also uncertainty levels. In 2001 a consortium of oil companies was organized in an attempt to understand seismic amplitude anomalies interpreted as DHIs and their impact on prospect risking and resource calculations (Roden et al., 2005; Forrest et al., 2010). The geologic setting, seismic and rock physics data quality, DHI characteristics, and calibration of drilling results are all incorporated into a database in a consistent and systematic process. From this process, the evaluation of 217 prospects and associated well results has enabled an in-depth understanding of the relevant key aspects of seismic amplitude anomalies and how they relate to drilling results. DHI Consortium background In the DHI Consortium, 41 oil companies have contributed to develop a seismic amplitude analysis process that system-atically provides probability of geologic success (Pg) values and associated implications for resource evaluations (Figure 1). The goals of the DHI consortium over the past 11 years have been and continue to be the following: 1) Gain a better understanding of how seismic amplitudes impact prospect risking (i. e., <b>predrill</b> chance of geological success or Pg). 2) Objectively characterize DHI observations using docu-mented occurrences of recoverable hydrocarbons in the subsurface via prospect reviews and risk analysis discus-sions. 3) Archive a statistically significant library of drilled prospect results...|$|E
30|$|The {{empirical}} {{relationship of}} Gardner et al. (1974) {{does not appear}} to give good estimates of density from velocity data in the Niger Delta. For this reason, the equation needs to be modified in order to satisfy local conditions and improve the accuracy of ensuing analyses. More realistic models of the density and better fits to observed data are possible by adjusting the coefficient in the equation so that minimal error is achieved in the analysis of named rock types. For example, as far as shales and sands are concerned, which are of greater interest to this study, the use of a default coefficient value of 0.31 in the Gardner equation is unsatisfactory. The uncertainty in the estimates is minimized when the coefficient is adjusted to provide individual reasonable fits to the shales and sands. Consequently, better estimates of density from velocity data of sands is obtained with Eq. (3) while Eq. (4) is best suited for the shales. The difference between the local modifications and the original Gardner relationship {{can be attributed to the}} differences in the composition of the originating rock types and probably because the Niger Delta is not genetically related to the sedimentary basins that Gardner et al. (1974) used in their empirical calibrations. In the Niger Delta, the shales and sands are of massive thickness and can be worked <b>predrill</b> because the density contrasts between both rock types makes it easier to distinguish them on most seismic data. Accepted that this separation could be difficult to realize in thin cyclic interbedding of shales and sands, in such diffuse cases, it is suggested that the default Gardner equation which is empirically an average for the two rock types may be incorporated and used with the local calibrations discussed in this study.|$|E
40|$|An {{integrated}} programme of experimental and analytical work {{was carried out}} to evaluate the nonlinear semi-rigid characteristics of timber connections using fully overlapping nails subjected to short duration lateral loading and moment. The investigation {{is part of a}} continuing programme of research at Napier University into the behaviour of timberjoints using fully overlapping nails as the connecting Z - 1 mechanism. The effects of the factors and material properties that influence the behaviour of nailed joints were addressed in a structured and controlled way allowing semi-empirical models to be developed for the lateral load behaviour of rnulti-nailed timber joints using steel and plywood gusset plates. A quality control procedure was established for the testing programme and consistent standards were applied to the preparation and testing work. The semi-empirical models that were developed included for the effect of timber density: crussept late material effect- nail strength; number of nails: nail diameter; row spacing and the effect of the moisture content in the timber. They covered joints assembled with and without a gap between the timber and the gusset plates and for joints assembled with steel gusset plates, the effect of the <b>predrill</b> size used in the gusset plate was also investigated. The model results compared very well with the results from tests, accurately predicting the non-linear behaviour of the joints up to failure. An extensive analytical and experimental study was carried out to investigate the moment-rotation behaviour of these types ofjoints. Two linear arýd four non-linear models were developed for each type of joint and the efficiencies of the models were compared to detennine the one that best simulated the joint behaviour. The linear models consistently underestimated the capacity of the joint, giving conservative results. The best solutions were obtained by applying the torsion formula used for steel connections and incorporating the nail behaviour models developed for the non-linear lateral load joints. Account was taken of the non-linear behaviour of the connection and alternative models using fixed and moveable centres of rotation were developed. Very good comparisons were achieved between these models and the test results. A detailed comparison was made between the behaviour of the joints using the lateral load displacement models and Eurocode 5 (EC 5) and it was concluded that EC 5 rules did not accurately simulate the behaviour of this type of joint. It was concluded that the nail spacing rules in the code did not apply to fully overlapping nails. A limit state design method based on the principles used in EC 5 has been developed from the models for the design of joints using fully overlapping nails and subjected to lateral loading or moment. The semi-rigid behaviour of the joints was also investigated and it was concluded that to safely predict the response of structures assembled with fully, overlapping nails. the semi-rigid behaviour must be included for in the analysis procedure. Rigidity factors, end fixing moment reduction factors and the secant rotational stiffness coefficients for the joints were derived. It was also shown that where the analysis was limited to the serviceability limit state. a modified elastic method of analysis could be used and where it was beyond this state a non-linear method of analysis was required.

40|$|The {{trade of}} {{softwood}} lumber between the United States and Canada {{is one of}} the major forest products trade flows in the world. Since 1996, exports from the four major softwood lumber producing provinces in Canada (British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, and Quebec) into the US have been regulated by the voluntary export restraint (VER) as defined within the “Softwood Lumber Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of the United States of America” (SLA). The SLA allows Canadian producers to export up to 14. 7 billion board feet (bbf) of softwood lumber without export fee and imposes high export fees on volumes exceeding the limit. The SLA is a temporary resolution of the trade dispute between the two countries that has lasted for more than fifteen years and is set to expire on March 31 st, 2001. The objective of this study is to determine if the expected effects of the SLA on the US softwood lumber market during the period 1996 - 1999 have actually occurred. The study discussed four possible direct effects and five possible indirect effects that the SLA might have had on the US softwood lumber market from a simple economic model and a review of the literature. The expected direct effects include: 1) a regulated volume of softwood lumber imports into the US from the four major provinces in Canada, 2) an increase in the price of softwood lumber in the US, 3) an increase in US softwood lumber production, and 4) a decrease in US softwood lumber consumption. The expected indirect effects of the SLA include: 1) a shift in the composition of countries exporting softwood lumber into the US, 2) an upgrade in the quality of softwood lumber exported from the four major Canadian provinces into the US, 3) an increase in the volume of softwood logs and value-added wood products exported from Canada into the US, 4) some attempts by Canadian manufacturers to avoid the export permit requirement under the SLA, and 5) an increase in the use of alternative products (both wood and nonwood) as substitutes for softwood lumber in the US. The study also provides a discussion of the alternative solutions that might be implemented upon the expiration of the SLA on March 31 st, 2001 and a discussion of desirability/undesirability of the SLA based upon future softwood resource availability in the US. DIRECT EFFECTS Since the implementation of the SLA, softwood lumber exports from the four major provinces into the US have been restricted below the volume imported before the implementation of the SLA in 1995. While the two fixed bases (the “established base” without export fee, and the “lower fee base” with a $ 50 /thousand board feet (mbf) export fee) were mostly filled, the exported volume under the “upper fee base,” with a $ 100 /mbf export fee, appeared to fluctuate in response to price changes in the US. In spite of the shift of softwood lumber production from western to eastern Canada, the composition of exported volume among the four major provinces has been consistent. An analysis of the price data shows that the SLA has increased the price of softwood lumber products in the US relative to Canada. A comparison of the price trends of identical softwood lumber products (i. e., eastern SPF 2 x 4 s, KD, # 1 and 2) in two closely located markets (i. e., Toronto and Boston) demonstrates this two-tiered price structure. The price trends show that since the implementation of the SLA, the price for softwood lumber in Boston has been nearly 15 % higher than for the identical product sold in Toronto. However, there was virtually no difference in the price of softwood lumber in these two markets during the period leading up to the implementation of the SLA (August 1994 – March 1996). Despite the relative price increase in the US, softwood lumber consumption in the US has substantially increased throughout the period due to strong economic growth. Domestic softwood lumber production has also increased slightly faster than consumption during the implementation of the SLA. As a result, the market share of imported softwood lumber declined from 36. 4 % of total US softwood lumber consumption in 1995 to 35. 2 % in 1999. INDIRECT EFFECTS In addition to the direct effects that the SLA has had on the softwood lumber market in the US, it has also had several indirect, and unintended, effects as well. Strong demand for softwood lumber in the US, coupled with restricted exports from the four major provinces in Canada, provided other foreign suppliers with an opportunity to enter and compete in the US market. While softwood lumber exports from the four major provinces have been relatively stable, the SLA-exempt provinces (New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba) took advantage of their position to increase their softwood lumber exports into the US from 1. 4 bbf during the first year of the SLA to 2. 9 bbf during the fourth year. As a result, the share of the SLA-exempt provinces in total Canadian softwood lumber exports to the US jumped from 7. 9 % during the first year of the SLA to 15. 6 % during the fourth year. Similarly, exports from non-Canadian countries have jumped from 389 million board feet (mmbf) to 912 mmbf during the same period. As a result, the share of other countries in US softwood lumber imports has increased from 2. 3 % to 4. 8 %. In spite of a report by industry analysts that Canadian forest products companies in the four provinces have shifted their softwood lumber exports to higher-grade products, no upward trend of Canadian products price relative to domestic products in the US was observed. Imports of value-added lumber such as siding and flooring, which are covered by the SLA, seemed to increase only marginally. To avoid the voluntary export restrictions specified in the SLA, some Canadian producers appear to have responded to the SLA by increasing their exports of softwood logs and value-added wood products to the US. US imports of softwood logs from Canada have increased substantially since the implementation of the SLA, increasing from 148, 000 m 3 in 1995 to almost 1. 1 million m 3 in 1999. In addition, imports of value-added wood products, such as windows, doors, and roof trusses, have also increased dramatically, although this increase can be partly attributed to the strong US housing market. In addition, some Canadian producers have attempted to have their lumber products reclassified as remanufactured lumber products by making slight product modifications, since remanufactured lumber products are exempt from the export permit requirement under the SLA. The main product modifications have been to <b>predrill,</b> notch, or rougher-head the studs. As a result, exports of products under HS code 4418. 90 (builders’ joinery and carpentry of wood), which include these modified studs, increased substantially. However, these products are generally used as ordinary studs after trimming or planing the modified parts. The US Coalition for Fair Lumber Imports (CFLI) has appealed the classification of these products to the US Customs Office as an illegal attempt to circumvent the SLA. While the appeals by the CFLI were successful in having rougher-headed studs reclassified as softwood lumber, the other appeals are still being considered at this time. Finally, by increasing the price and price volatility of softwood lumber in the US, the SLA may have contributed to the ongoing process of substitution of softwood lumber by wood and non-wood alternative materials. However, the extent to which the SLA has contributed to the process of material substitution is difficult to evaluate. FUTURE PROSPECTS FOR THE US-CANADA SOFTWOOD LUMBER TRADE There are four possible options that might be implemented at the expiration of the SLA on March 31 st, 2001. These options include: 1) an extension of the current agreement, 2) the imposition of a countervailing duty by the US, 3) “fair trade” with major changes in the stumpage pricing system employed in Canada, or 4) “free trade” and the elimination of the SLA. Recent events in both Canada (with regards to the recent lowering of stumpage prices in BC) and the US (with regards to the position of the CFLI) suggest that the implementation of options 3) and 4) are unlikely. Given the current political situation in both countries, with presidential elections occurring in early November 2000 in the US and national elections occurring in late November in Canada, it is possible that the two governments might decide to extend the SLA for a short period of time. However, the CFLI insists that it will seek some type of countervailing action if Canada fails to address the stumpage price issue appropriately following the expiration of the SLA. Given the inequities that some Canadian lumber manufacturers perceive with the existing SLA, it is likely that at least some producers in Canada would prefer to see the SLA expire and be replaced with a countervailing duty, since this would impose no limit on the volume of softwood lumber that they could export to the US. Considering the restrained domestic timber supply and the uncertain future availability of Canadian softwood lumber, it is important for the US to build a cooperative relationship with Canada in order to provide secure softwood lumber supply...|$|E
