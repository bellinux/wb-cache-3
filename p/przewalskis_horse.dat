25|$|Earlier DNA {{sequencing}} {{studies had}} been done to test whether or not the <b>Przewalski</b> <b>horse</b> is the primogenitor of domestic horses, but it was found that they are not. If <b>Przewalski</b> <b>horses</b> were indeed the ancestors of domesticated horses, those sequences, too would have been found within the <b>Przewalski</b> <b>horse</b> sequences. The DNA was then tested the other way as well; domestic horse sequences were checked for <b>Przewalski</b> <b>horse</b> sequences, and were found to contain none. This puts to rest the theory that <b>Przewalski</b> <b>horses</b> were derived from domestic horses. Studies of the DNA diversity within the <b>Przewalski</b> <b>horses</b> have been done to see how successful their reintroduction into the wild may be. Studies have shown through multidimensional scaling analyses that tight grouping occurs within most horse breeds, close grouping between related breeds, and far less grouping between mixed breeds. The <b>Przewalski</b> <b>horse</b> and the domesticated horse showed a close relationship through pairwise genetic distance and multidimensional scaling analyses showing that the <b>Przewalski</b> <b>horse</b> is very closely related to the domesticated horse.|$|R
25|$|The <b>Przewalski</b> <b>horse's</b> diet {{consists}} {{mostly of}} vegetation. There are many plant species {{in a typical}} <b>Przewalski</b> <b>horse</b> environment including: Elymus repens, Carex spp., Fabaceae, and Asteraceae. While the horses eat {{a variety of different}} plant species, they tend to favor one species during a specific time of the year. In other words, the <b>Przewalski</b> <b>horses</b> have seasonal food preferences. In the springtime, <b>Przewalski</b> <b>horses</b> favor Elymus repens, Corynephorus canescens, Festuca valesiaca, and Chenopodium album. In early summer they favor Dactylis glomerata and Trifolium and in late summer, they gravitate towards Elymus repens and Vicia cracca. In winter, for example, the horses eat Salix spp., Pyrus communis, Malus sylvatica, Pinus sylvestris, Rosa spp., and Alnus spp. Additionally, <b>Przewalski</b> <b>horses</b> may dig for Festuca spp., Bromus inermis and Elymus repens that grow beneath the ice and snow. The <b>Przewalski</b> <b>horse’s</b> winter diet is very similar to the diet of domestic horses. Studies have suggested that in the wintertime, <b>Przewalski</b> <b>horses</b> experience hypodermis. Hypodermis is a condition in which one’s metabolic rate slows down. This means that in the winter time, <b>Przewalski</b> <b>horse’s</b> process their food more slowly than they do during other times of the year. Looking at the species diet overall, however, <b>Przewalski</b> <b>horses</b> most often eat Elymus repens, Trifolium pratense, Vicia cracca, Poa trivialis, Dactylis glomerata and Bromus inermis.|$|R
25|$|A 2009 {{molecular}} {{study using}} ancient DNA recovered from archaeological finds places the <b>Przewalski's</b> <b>horse</b> {{in the middle}} of the domesticated horses, but 2011 mitochondrialDNA analysis suggests that the Przewalski and the modern domestic horse diverged some 160,000years ago. An analysis based on whole genome sequencing and calibration with DNA from old horse bones gave a divergence date of 38–72 thousand years ago. The karyotype of the domestic horse differs from that of <b>Przewalski’s</b> <b>horse</b> by an extra chromosome pair either because of the ﬁssion of domestic <b>horse</b> chromosome5 in <b>Przewalski’s</b> <b>horse</b> or fusion of <b>Przewalski’s</b> <b>horse</b> chromosomes 23 and 24 in the domestic horse. In comparison, the chromosomal differences between domestic horses and zebras include numerous translocations, fusions, and inversions. <b>Przewalski’s</b> <b>horse</b> is known to have the highest diploid chromosome number among all equine species. <b>Przewalski’s</b> <b>horse</b> can interbreed with the domestic horse and produce fertile offspring (65chromosomes).|$|R
50|$|<b>Przewalski's</b> <b>horse</b> {{has some}} {{biological}} differences from the domestic horse; unlike domesticated horses and the tarpan, which both have 64 chromosomes, <b>Przewalski's</b> <b>horse</b> has 66 chromosomes {{due to a}} Robertsonian translocation. However, the offspring of <b>Przewalski</b> and domestic <b>horses</b> are fertile, possessing 65 chromosomes.|$|R
40|$|The {{endangered}} <b>Przewalski's</b> <b>horse</b> is {{the closest}} relative of the domestic horse {{and is the only}} true wild horse species surviving today. The question of whether <b>Przewalski's</b> <b>horse</b> is the direct progenitor of domestic horse has been hotly debated. Studies of DNA diversity within <b>Przewalski's</b> <b>horses</b> have been sparse but are urgently needed to ensure their successful reintroduction to the wild. In an attempt to resolve the controversy surrounding the phylogenetic position and genetic diversity of <b>Przewalski's</b> <b>horses,</b> we used massively parallel sequencing technology to decipher the complete mitochondrial and partial nuclear genomes for all four surviving maternal lineages of <b>Przewalski's</b> <b>horses.</b> Unlike single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) typing usually affected by ascertainment bias, the present method is expected to be largely unbiased. Three mitochondrial haplotypes were discovered—two similar ones, haplotypes I/II, and one substantially divergent from the other two, haplotype III. Haplotypes I/II versus III did not cluster together on a phylogenetic tree, rejecting the monophyly of <b>Przewalski's</b> <b>horse</b> maternal lineages, and were estimated to split 0. 117 – 0. 186 Ma, significantly preceding horse domestication. In the phylogeny based on autosomal sequences, <b>Przewalski's</b> <b>horses</b> formed a monophyletic clade, separate from the Thoroughbred domestic horse lineage. Our results suggest that <b>Przewalski's</b> <b>horses</b> have ancient origins and are not the direct progenitors of domestic horses. The analysis of the vast amount of sequence data presented here suggests that <b>Przewalski's</b> and domestic <b>horse</b> lineages diverged at least 0. 117 Ma but since then have retained ancestral genetic polymorphism and/or experienced gene flow...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Przewalski's</b> <b>horse</b> (now Equus ferus przewalskii) is {{currently}} {{believed to be}} unrelated to the modern domestic horse, though studies using DNA have had varied results. Recent mitochondrial DNA analysis suggests that the Przewalski and the modern domestic horse diverged some 160,000 years ago. Studies using DNA have been inconclusive. A 2009 molecular study using ancient DNA (that is DNA recovered from archaeological finds like bones and teeth) places the <b>Przewalski's</b> <b>Horse</b> {{in the middle of}} the domesticated horses, [...] These difficulties exist in part due to crossing domestic <b>horses</b> into the <b>Przewalski's</b> <b>Horse</b> as well as the limited genetic variation present in the founder population of the modern <b>Przewalski's</b> <b>Horse.</b>|$|R
40|$|In 1992 the {{reintroduction}} {{program of}} the <b>Przewalski’s</b> <b>horses</b> in Mongolia was initiated, and totally 84 individuals of <b>Przewalski’s</b> <b>horses</b> {{were brought to the}} Hustai National Park between 1992 and 2000.

40|$|In China, {{the first}} <b>Przewalski’s</b> <b>horse</b> (Equus przewalskii) group was {{released}} in Kalamaili Ungulate Protected Area in Xinjiang, in August 2001. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate reproduction and development of released <b>Przewalski’s</b> <b>horses</b> in Xinjiang, China from 2002 to 2006. Twenty-four descendants were naturally born, average reproduction rate was 38. 7 %, and average survival rate of foals was 69. 1 % in this interim. Frequent alternation of the leading stallion and infertility in female horses due to environmental factors were main causes for the low reproduction rate. The infant mortality rate of released <b>Przewalski’s</b> <b>horses</b> was 25. 0 %, and 83. 3 % of death in infants was due to the leading stallion infanticide. The released <b>Przewalski’s</b> <b>horses</b> exhibited seasonal breeding, 70. 8 % of infants were born in May and June. The fertility rates were 8. 3 % in April and 37. 5 % in May, which were lower compared to those of the captive <b>Przewalski’s</b> <b>horse</b> groups (18. 3 % and 44. 3 %, respectively). Furthermore, the fertility rate in June was 33. 3 % and higher than the captive groups (18. 3 %).
