50|$|Windows XP <b>prompts</b> <b>for</b> <b>credentials</b> upon {{authentication}} {{errors and}} allows saving those that use Integrated Windows Authentication to a secure roaming keyring store {{protected by the}} Data Protection API. Saved credentials can be managed from the Stored User Names and Passwords item in the User accounts control panel. If a certificate authority is present, then users can a select an X.509 certificate when <b>prompted</b> <b>for</b> <b>credentials.</b> When that same resource is accessed again, the saved credentials will be used. Remote access/VPN connections also create temporary credentials in the keyring to make the experience seamless. Credential Manager also exposes an API for Single Sign On.|$|R
50|$|If user {{authentication}} is enabled, the user is <b>prompted</b> <b>for</b> <b>credentials</b> at the device control panel. These credentials are then stored in an HTTP header and forwarded to an HP OXPd web application for validation. Since network credentials are being passed via the HTTP header, HP strongly recommends using SSL with HTTP, or HTTPS. This security measure will encrypt the users' credentials and effectively protects sensitive data travelling {{to and from}} devices from unauthorized access.|$|R

To fetch a service ticket {{for a particular}} application, and not prompt the user to enter credentials again, that application must be specifically coded to support Kerberos, as pam_krb5 cannot itself get service tickets, although there are versions of PAM-KRB5 that are attempting to work around the issue.|$|R

50|$|User Account Control {{is a new}} {{infrastructure}} that requires user consent before allowing any action that requires administrative privileges. With this feature, all users, including users with administrative privileges, run in a standard user mode by default, since most applications do not require higher privileges. When some action is attempted that needs administrative privileges, such as installing new software or changing system settings, Windows will prompt the user whether to allow the action or not. If the user chooses to allow, the process initiating the action is elevated to a higher privilege context to continue. While standard users need to enter a username and password of an administrative account to get a process elevated (Over-the-shoulder Credentials), an administrator can choose to be <b>prompted</b> just <b>for</b> consent or ask <b>for</b> <b>credentials.</b>|$|R
