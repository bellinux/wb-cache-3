40|$|BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with {{hereditary}} hemochromatosis (HH) need frequent <b>phlebotomies</b> {{to reduce}} iron overload. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) {{were reported to}} {{reduce the need for}} <b>phlebotomies</b> in patients homozygous for the C 282 Y mutation in HFE. We investigated the effects of PPI treatment on numbers of <b>phlebotomies</b> in these patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of patients with HH homozygous for the C 282 Y mutation by using the database and medical records from Atrium Medical Centrum Parkstad in Brunssum, The Netherlands. In a paired group analysis of 12 patients, we compared mean serum levels of ferritin and number of <b>phlebotomies</b> needed each year during the periods of 3 years before and 3 years after the start of PPI therapy. We compared these results with those from a group who received PPIs for at least 2 years (n = 9) and a group who never received PPIs (n = 36). RESULTS: We found a significant reduction in median number of <b>phlebotomies</b> after patients began taking PPIs vs before (0. 50 vs 3. 17, P <. 002). Patients who received PPIs for at least 2 years needed significantly fewer <b>phlebotomies</b> than patients in the paired group before they started taking PPIs (1. 25 vs 3. 17, P <. 001). The number of <b>phlebotomies</b> in the group who never received PPIs was significantly higher than in the paired group after they started taking PPIs (3. 0 vs 0. 5, P <. 001). CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of a retrospective analysis, in patients with HH homozygous for the C 282 Y mutation in HFE, treatment with PPIs for 2 or more years significantly reduced the number of <b>phlebotomies</b> required to maintain serum levels of ferritin below 100 mug/L...|$|R

40|$|It is {{not known}} whether iron {{depletion}} before pegylated IFN or combination treatment improves sustained virological response (SVR) rate in patients with chronic hepatitis C, despite its use in clinical practice in this setting. We aimed to investigate whether blood letting improves the efficacy (SVR) and tolerability of PEG-IFNalpha 2 b + Ribavirin in chronic hepatitis C patients. Patients with chronic hepatitis C and ferritin > 100 ng/mL were randomized to: (1) repeated <b>phlebotomies</b> to obtain a ferritin level < 50 ng/mL followed by pegylated-Interferon alpha 2 b + ribavirin (active arm); or (2) pegylated-Interferon alpha 2 b + ribavirin (control arm). Primary endpoint was SVR rate, secondary endpoint was frequency of clinical and laboratory grade 3 - 4 adverse events. Thirty-three patients {{were enrolled in the}} study (19 in active arm, 14 in control arm). The 19 patients in the active arm underwent a median of 5 <b>phlebotomies</b> (range: 1 - 9) to achieve the targeted ferritin (< 50 ng/mL). <b>Phlebotomies</b> significantly reduced ferritin, iron, transferrin saturation, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and hemoglobin levels. Platelet count significantly increased, whereas HCV-RNA levels remained unchanged. After antiviral therapy overall SVR was 31. 6 % in active arm and 21. 4 % in control arm (P = 0. 698). Considering only the 18 patients who were naive to antiviral therapy, SVR was 60 % in active arm versus 25 % in control arm (P = 0. 188). Tolerability, drug dose reduction or withdrawal were similar in the two arms. In conclusion <b>phlebotomies</b> do not increase the overall efficacy of antiviral therapy. However, the strong trend to higher SVR in naive patients undergoing <b>phlebotomies</b> warrants further investigation. J. Clin. Apheresis 2009. (c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R

Methods : The PCT cases were retrieved from computerized databases. Patient files lacking information {{on the presence of}} concomitant liver disease were excluded from further analysis. Results : 29 PCT patients were retrieved from our databases, of which 17 patients with sPCT were retained for further analysis. Patients were middle aged (mean age: 43 3) and there was no gender difference (10 males vs. 7 females). Almost all patients had iron overload (14 / 17). 5 patients had chronic HCV, with type 1 b in 3 of them, 7 abused alcohol, 4 patients had hereditary haemochromatosis (3 homozygous C 282 Y - 1 heterozygous H 63 D/C 282 Y). In 3 patients sPCT was associated with medication intake and one patient had chronic hepatitis B (HBV). 13 patients were treated with <b>phlebotomies,</b> with success in 11 / 13. 4 patients were treated with chloroquine, 3 of which also underwent <b>phlebotomies.</b> Of the 5 patients with HCV, 3 were successfully treated with combined antiviral therapy; one of them is planned to be treated; one patient never received therapy and was lost from follow-up. One patient developed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) during a median follow-up of 24 years. Conclusions : We found a significant association between sPCT and liver disorders, such as chronic HCV infection, alcohol abuse, iron overload and hereditary haemochromatosis. Therefore, patients presenting with PCT should be screened for concomitant liver disease. Iron overload is present in a majority of patients, the majority of patients can be successfully treated with <b>phlebotomies.</b> The risk of developing HCC in our sPCT patients and in literature is low...|$|R

Using a portable hemoglobinometer (PH) could provide an easy and fast determination of hemoglobin. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to compare, in hemochromatosis patients treated by bloodletting, the hemoglobin concentrations as assayed, on capillary blood, by a PH device and, on venous blood, by a cell counter (CC) device. For a total period of 12 weeks duration, all patients undergoing <b>phlebotomies</b> in the same hospital outpatient unit had hemoglobin determinations both by the HemoCue and by the laboratory's DxH 800 Coulter. To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the HemoCue, patients were classified as presenting or not anemia as defined by hemoglobin level below 11 g/dl. Measurements of hemoglobin were performed in 122 patients. The sensitivity and specificity of PH compared to CC were 100 and 98. 1 %, respectively. Capillary hemoglobin by PH slightly underestimated venous hemoglobin by CC. The Pearson's correlation coefficient between PH and CC was 0. 80 (P< 0. 0001).

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{evaluate}} {{the environmental and}} ecological factors associated with Leishmania transmission and vector abundance in Chaparral, Tolima-Colombia. METHODS First, we compared the ecological characteristics, abundance of <b>phlebotomies</b> and potential reservoir hosts in the peridomestic environment (100 m radius) of randomly selected houses, between two townships with high and low cutaneous leishmaniasis incidence. Second, we examined peridomestic correlates of phlebotomine abundance in all 43 houses in the higher risk township. RESULTS The high transmission township had higher coverage of forest (23 %vs. 8. 4 %) and shade coffee (30. 7 %vs. 11 %), and less coffee monoculture (16. 8 %vs. 26. 2 %) and pasture (6. 3 %vs. 12. 3 %), compared to the low transmission township. Lutzomyia were more abundant in the high transmission township 2. 5 vs. 0. 2 /trap/night.
