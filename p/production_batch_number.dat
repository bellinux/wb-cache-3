50|$|In 1982, the U.S. Army {{accepted}} an initial delivery {{of at least}} six Dragoons from the first <b>production</b> <b>batch.</b> An unknown <b>number</b> (sources differ) from this batch was procured by the United States Navy. The first army vehicles were used by the 9th Infantry Division High Technology Test Bed, in three forms: Personnel Carrier (3?), EW variant with AN/MSQ-103A Teampack system (2), and a video optical surveillance vehicle with a retractable long-range day/night surveillance system mounted in a modified Arrowpointe 25 mm two-man turret, and connected to an on-board data link. This version was intended to provide field commanders and rear line command staff with a highly mobile, armour-protected observation capability.|$|R
50|$|The heavy machine-gun vehicle {{featured}} the Modèle réglementaire AVIS-2 turret {{fitted with a}} Hotchkiss 13,2 mm Modèle 1930 mitrailleuse, which could penetrate 20 mm steel at 500 metres. To accommodate the larger machine-gun, the turret was made higher, more so at the left where the commander/gunner was seated and from which side the gun was fed — normally this was done vertically, but to reduce height the gun had been rotated to the left — giving it an asymmetrical and skewed appearance. This heavier type was produced parallel to the 7.5 mm machine-gun vehicles of the first <b>production</b> <b>batch</b> in a <b>number</b> of eighty; it was originally seen as the normal combat version, four {{of which would be}} present in a platoon of five. Later however, production was discontinued: though in 1934 even many battle tanks had been so lightly armoured as to be vulnerable to 13.2 mm fire, such a weapon had already become obsolete for this rôle in 1936. The gun had an ammunition stock of 1220 rounds: 740 in 37 magazines of twenty and another 480 in cardboard boxes.|$|R
40|$|A polyphasic {{approach}} {{was used to}} evaluate the diversity and persistence of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains during the production and ripening of two Flemish artisanal raw milk Gouda-type cheeses, Bellie and Dulses. During two consecutive productions with a one-month interval, samples of milk, starter, curd and cheese at various ripening times were sampled for conventional culturing using four different selective media. The resulting set of 734 isolates was identified using (GTG) (5) -PCR fingerprinting and sequence analysis of the 16 S rRNA and pheS genes. Isolated LAB mainly consisted of Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus curvatus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus durans and Lactobacillus perolens. A combined typing approach including (GTG) (5) -PCR and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis revealed the presence of a Lc. lactis subsp. lactis isolate of the starter in ripened cheese at eight weeks and the persistence of several other LAB strains throughout the two successive <b>production</b> <b>batches.</b> Possibly, a <b>number</b> of these strains are autochthonous members of the microbial cheese production environment that {{play an important role in}} the development of the sensory properties of the cheese...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{pursuit of}} better {{coordination}} schemes {{is crucial for}} contemporary supply chains {{to survive in a}} highly competitive environment. A supply chain may employ revenue sharing, information sharing and quantity discounts etc. to gain that viable edge. Another recent trend is to store vendor's inventory at the buyer's warehouse, known as vendor-managed-inventory (VMI) with consignment stock (CS) agreement. This paper brings the present literature in with consignment stock closer to real life by introducing the notion of screening defective items. A single-vendor single-buyer supply chain is considered where the vendor ships every <b>production</b> <b>batch</b> in a <b>number</b> of lots to the buyer's warehouse. The buyer withdraws and screens these products while fulfilling the market demand. An analytical model is developed to depict this scenario. The impact of different fractions of defective items, storage costs as well as disposal schemes is also studied. The results indicate that the prominence of the proposed storage scheme over the conventional one remains proportional to the size and number of shipments in a cycle. Besides, the non-financial component of storage costs has a critical impact on the cost of the supply chain...|$|R

40|$|The {{experiment}} {{consisted of}} 78 <b>production</b> <b>batches</b> of broiler chicken {{out of which}} 52 <b>production</b> <b>batches</b> were hybrid chickens Cobb 500 and 26 <b>production</b> <b>batches</b> were Ross 308. During 13 <b>production</b> <b>batches</b> was used green lighting for the feeding regimen and during 65 batches was used white light. The broilers were slaughtered {{at the age of}} 32. 96 days. The Ross 308 hybrid (2. 13 kg) reached 0. 09 kg higher live weight compared to hybrid Cobb 500 (2. 04 kg). In the case of Ross 308 there was 0. 03 kg lower feed consumption (1. 66, resp. 1. 69 kg) and 0. 15 % lower mortality (3. 54, resp. 3. 68 %). The difference in the index of European Efficiency Factor was 23 points in favour of Ross 308 (376, resp. 353 points). The mean length of <b>production</b> <b>batch</b> with green lighting was 0. 54 day shorter (32. 51, resp. 33. 05 days). The difference in live weight was very small in <b>production</b> <b>batches</b> with different lighting colour regimes (0. 05 kg). The difference in feed consumption per 1 kg of weight gain was 0. 06 kg in favour of broilers fattening while using green light. Mortality rate of broilers was 0. 3 % lower when fattening while using white light. The European Efficiency Factor was 9 points higher while fattening using green light. The correlation of live weight of broiler at slaughter with the age of breeding flock was r = 0. 42, moderate, statistically highly significant...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Pharmacovigilance {{requirements}} for biologics mandate that EU Member States shall ensure that any biologic {{that is the}} subject of a suspected adverse drug reaction (ADR) is identifiable by brand name and <b>batch</b> <b>number.</b> Recent studies showed that brand name identification is well established, whereas <b>batch</b> <b>numbers</b> are (still) poorly reported. We evaluated information-recording systems and practices in the Dutch hospital setting to identify determinants for brand name and <b>batch</b> <b>number</b> recording as well as success factors and bottlenecks for traceability. METHODS: We surveyed Dutch hospital pharmacists with an online questionnaire on systems and practices in hospitals for recording brand names and <b>batch</b> <b>numbers.</b> Additionally, we performed an analysis of the traceability of recombinant biologics in spontaneous ADR reports (received between 2009 and 2014) from the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb. RESULTS: The survey showed that brand names are not routinely recorded in the clinical practice of Dutch hospitals, whereas <b>batch</b> <b>numbers</b> are poorly recorded. Seventy-six percent of the 1523 ADR reports for recombinant biologics had a traceable brand name whereas 5 % of these reports contained a <b>batch</b> <b>number.</b> The results suggest a possible relationship between the availability of brand and <b>batch</b> <b>number</b> information in clinical practice and the inclusion of this information in ADR reports for biologics. CONCLUSION: The limited traceability of brand names and <b>batch</b> <b>numbers</b> in ADR reports may be primarily caused by the shortcomings in the recording of information in clinical practice. We recommend efforts to improve information-recording systems as a first step to improve the traceability of biologics in ADR reporting...|$|R
