5|$|A {{closely related}} <b>problem,</b> the minimax path <b>problem,</b> asks for {{the path that}} {{minimizes}} the maximum weight of any of its edges. It has applications that include transportation planning. Any algorithm for the widest path <b>problem</b> can be transformed into an algorithm for the minimax path <b>problem,</b> or vice versa, by reversing the sense of all the weight comparisons performed by the algorithm, or equivalently by replacing every edge weight by its negation.|$|E
5|$|A {{natural setting}} for <b>problem</b> of Apollonius is inversive geometry. The basic {{strategy}} of inversive methods is to transform a given Apollonius <b>problem</b> into another Apollonius <b>problem</b> that is simpler to solve; {{the solutions to}} the original <b>problem</b> are found from the solutions of the transformed <b>problem</b> by undoing the transformation. Candidate transformations must change one Apollonius <b>problem</b> into another; therefore, they must transform the given points, circles and lines to other points, circles and lines, and no other shapes. Circle inversion has this property and allows the center and radius of the inversion circle to be chosen judiciously. Other candidates include the Euclidean plane isometries; however, they do not simplify the <b>problem,</b> since they merely shift, rotate, and mirror the original <b>problem.</b>|$|E

5|$|Apollonius' <b>problem</b> can be {{extended}} from the plane to the sphere and other quadratic surfaces. For the sphere, the <b>problem</b> is to construct all the circles (the boundaries of spherical caps) that are tangent to three given circles on the sphere. This spherical <b>problem</b> can be rendered into a corresponding planar <b>problem</b> using stereographic projection. Once the solutions to the planar <b>problem</b> have been constructed, the corresponding solutions to the spherical <b>problem</b> can be determined by inverting the stereographic projection. Even more generally, one can consider the <b>problem</b> of four tangent curves that result from the intersections of an arbitrary quadratic surface and four planes, a <b>problem</b> first considered by Charles Dupin.|$|E
5|$|Circle inversions {{correspond}} to {{a subset of}} Möbius transformations on the Riemann sphere. The planar Apollonius <b>problem</b> can {{be transferred to the}} sphere by an inverse stereographic projection; hence, solutions of the planar Apollonius <b>problem</b> also pertain to its counterpart on the sphere. Other inversive solutions to the planar <b>problem</b> are possible besides the common ones described below.|$|E
5|$|If {{the three}} given circles are {{mutually}} tangent, Apollonius' <b>problem</b> has five solutions. Three solutions are the given circles themselves, since each is tangent to itself {{and to the}} other two given circles. The remaining two solutions (shown in red in Figure12) correspond to the inscribed and circumscribed circles, and are called Soddy's circles. This special case of Apollonius' <b>problem</b> is also known as the four coins <b>problem.</b> The three given circles of this Apollonius <b>problem</b> form a Steiner chain tangent to the two Soddy's circles.|$|E

5|$|In graph algorithms, {{the widest}} path <b>problem</b> is the <b>problem</b> {{of finding a}} path between two {{designated}} vertices in a weighted graph, maximizing {{the weight of the}} minimum-weight edge in the path. The widest path <b>problem</b> is also known as the bottleneck shortest path <b>problem</b> or the maximum capacity path <b>problem.</b> It is possible to adapt most shortest path algorithms to compute widest paths, by modifying them to use the bottleneck distance instead of path length. However, in many cases even faster algorithms are possible.|$|E
5|$|In number theory, Znám's <b>problem</b> asks {{which sets}} of k {{integers}} have the property that each integer {{in the set}} is a proper divisor of {{the product of the}} other integers in the set, plus 1. Znám's <b>problem</b> is named after the Slovak mathematician Štefan Znám, who suggested it in 1972, although other mathematicians had considered similar problems around the same time. One closely related <b>problem</b> drops the assumption of properness of the divisor, and will be called the improper Znám <b>problem</b> hereafter.|$|E

5|$|Most {{versions}} of the clique <b>problem</b> are hard. The clique decision <b>problem</b> is NP-complete (one of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems). The <b>problem</b> of finding the maximum clique is both fixed-parameter intractable and hard to approximate. And, listing all maximal cliques may require exponential time as there exist graphs with exponentially many maximal cliques. Therefore, much of the theory about the clique <b>problem</b> is devoted to identifying special types of graph that admit more efficient algorithms, or to establishing the computational difficulty of the general <b>problem</b> in various models of computation.|$|E
5|$|The closure <b>problem</b> {{takes as}} input a {{directed}} acyclic graph with weights on its vertices and seeks the minimum (or maximum) weight of a closure, a set of vertices with no outgoing edges. (The <b>problem</b> may be formulated for directed graphs without the assumption of acyclicity, but with no greater generality, because {{in this case it}} is equivalent to the same <b>problem</b> on the condensation of the graph.) It may be solved in polynomial time using a reduction to the maximum flow <b>problem.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{extension}} of Apollonius' <b>problem</b> to three dimensions, namely, the <b>problem</b> {{of finding a}} fifth sphere that is tangent to four given spheres, can be solved by analogous methods. For example, the given and solution spheres can be resized so that one given sphere is shrunk to point while maintaining tangency. Inversion in this point reduces Apollonius' <b>problem</b> to finding a plane that is tangent to three given spheres. There are in general eight such planes, which become the solutions to the original <b>problem</b> by reversing the inversion and the resizing. This <b>problem</b> was first considered by Pierre de Fermat, and many alternative solution methods have been developed over the centuries.|$|E

This longitudinal study (N = 497 families) examined the mediating and moderating role of parental externalizing <b>problems</b> in {{the relation between}} interparental conflict and internalizing <b>problems</b> of adolescent boys and girls. The influence of maternal and paternal externalizing <b>problems</b> on internalizing <b>problems</b> was examined separately.

30|$|Very recently, Lin and Chuang [24] {{studied the}} well-posedness in the {{generalized}} sense for variational inclusion <b>problems</b> and variational disclusion <b>problems,</b> the well-posedness for optimization <b>problems</b> with variational inclusion <b>problems,</b> variational disclusion <b>problems</b> as constraints. Motivated by Lin, Wang et al. [25] investigated the well-posedness for generalized quasi-variational inclusion <b>problems</b> and for optimization <b>problems</b> with generalized quasi-variational inclusion <b>problems</b> as constraints. A system of generalized quasi-variational inclusion <b>problems,</b> {{which consists of}} a family of generalized quasi-variational inclusion <b>problems</b> defined on a product set, was first introduced by Lin [26]. It is well known that the system of generalized quasi-variational inclusion <b>problems</b> contains the system of variational inequalities, the system of equilibrium <b>problems,</b> the system of vector equilibrium <b>problems,</b> the system of vector quasi-equilibrium <b>problems,</b> the system of generalized vector quasi-equilibrium <b>problems,</b> the system of variational inclusions <b>problems</b> and variational disclusions <b>problems</b> as special cases.

More general formulations of such <b>problems</b> are for automorphic functions which were first studied by Gakhov and Chibrikova [9, 10]. From the practical point of view, the periodic boundary value <b>problems</b> are considerably important.
