Scientists and producers keep on searching new filtration materials which allow for better water purification, are simple in exploitation and do not add chemical substances to the treated water. Therefore, the aim {{of the present study was}} to analyze physical and chemical parameters of two unknown <b>porous</b> <b>masses</b> X 1 and X 2. Such physical parameters as color, granulation, bulk density, the equivalent diameter, the coefficient of uniformity and the porosity of the material were measured and determined. Additionally, the possibility of water treatment was studied during the filtration process in the laboratory tests. Chemical parameters were examined in the water flowing through the mass, such as pH, conductivity and COD-Mn as a general indicator of the content of organic substances in the water.

40|$|The nests of Cornitermes cumulans K.

Young colonies inhabit small subterranean nests that develop into large, conspicuous, epigean mounds, inhabited by very populous colonies. Those macromorphological transformations are accompanied by micromorphological changes occurring gradually in the nest walls. The micromorphological changes during nest development described in the present study expand on previous macromorphological descriptions by explaining the re-organization of the soil components during nest growth. In subterranean nests, walls are composed of piles of lensshaped aggregates of soil material, each one surrounded by a thin organic coating. As the nest grows, mound walls are constructed by disassembling this first lenticular structure and rearranging the materials in a new fabric, where sand grains are loosely distributed among soil microaggregates of organic matter and clay.

Relatively large (> 5 mu m) and <b>porous</b> (<b>mass</b> density < 0. 4 g/cm(3)) {{particles}} present {{advantages for}} {{the delivery of}} drugs to the lungs, e. g., excellent aerosolization properties. The {{aim of this study}} was, first, to formulate such particles with excipients that are either FDA-approved for inhalation or endogenous to the lungs; and second, to compare the aerodynamic size and performance of the particles with theoretical estimates based on bulk powder measurements. Methods. Dry powders were made of water-soluble excipients (e. g., lactose, albumin) combined with water-insoluble material (e. g., lung surfactant), using a standard single-step spray-drying process. Aerosolization properties were assessed with a Spinbaler(TM) device in vitro in both an Andersen cascade impactor and an Aerosizer(TM). Results. By properly choosing excipient concentration and varying the spray drying parameters, a high degree of control was achieved over the physical properties of the dry powders. Mean geometric diameters ranged between 3 and 15 mu m, and tap densities between 0. 04 and 0. 6 g/cm(3). Theoretical estimates of mass mean aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) were rationalized and calculated in terms of geometric particle diameters and bulk tap densities. Experimental values of MMAD obtained from the Aerosizer(TM) most closely approximated the theoretical estimates, as compared to those obtained from the Andersen cascade impactor. Particles possessing high porosity and large size, with theoretical estimates of MMAD between 1 - 3 mu m, exhibited emitted doses as high as 96 % and respirable fractions ranging up to 49 % or 92 %, depending on measurement technique...|$|E

In many engineering problems, momentum, energy and mass transport take place together and these equations must be analyzed simultaneously. Especially in food industry, the most important step of processes like cooking, drying, smoking is the simultaneous heat and mass transfer. During these processes, significant changes in physical, chemical and nutritional properties of food occur. Most of these changes are functions of temperature, humidity and time. In cavities with moisture sources, investigating simultaneous heat and mass transfer is important to reveal {{the behavior of the}} system. In this study, an experimental and numerical investigation was carried out on the simultaneous heat and mass transfer inside a heated cavity which has a moisture source in it. For analyzing simultaneous heat and mass transfer, a model of a heated cavity having a <b>porous</b> <b>mass</b> source (brick) was established. For analysis studies, commercial FLUENT® software which solves basic momentum, energy and mass transport equations is used. In order to express the vaporization of the water in the brick, an external code is written. Within the scope of experimental studies, a cavity which had a water soaked brick within was used. The brick was heated by hot air which was forwarded into cavity. During the tests, the temperature change in the cavity and brick were recorded. In order to express the mass loss of the brick, the mass change of the brick was also recorded. The boundary values which are needed in the modeling studies were determined experimentally. The results of the analysis studies implemented were compared with the experimental results and good agreement was observed for the temperature of the brick and the mass loss of the brick. dc 201...|$|E

40|$|Many metal {{extraction}} operations, such as leaching of copper, leaching {{of precious}} metals, and reduction of metal oxides to metal in high-temperature furnaces, require agglomeration of ore {{to ensure that}} reactive liquids or gases are evenly distributed throughout the ore being processed. Agglomeration of ore into coarse, <b>porous</b> <b>masses</b> achieves this even distribution of fluids by preventing fine particles from migrating and clogging the spaces and channels between the larger ore particles. Binders are critically necessary to produce agglomerates that will not break down during processing. However, for many important metal extraction processes there are no binders known that will work satisfactorily at a reasonable cost. A primary {{example of this is}} copper heap leaching, where there are no binders currently encountered in this acidic environment process. As a result, operators of many facilities see a large loss of process efficiency due to their inability to take advantage of agglomeration. The large quantities of ore that must be handled in metal extraction processes also means that the binder must be inexpensive and useful at low dosages to be economical. The acid-resistant binders and agglomeration procedures developed in this project will also be adapted for use in improving the energy efficiency and performance of a broad range of mineral agglomeration applications, particularly heap leaching.

The level of ‘permeability’ in sinter-bed is depending upon the effectiveness of ‘charging chute’ in size-wise ‘segregation’ of charge materials across the depth in sinter-bed, achieved due to differences in the sliding velocities of particles during charging into the moving sinter-bed. The permeability achieved by the earlier conventional ‘charging chute’ was limited due to its design and positional constraints in sinter machine. Improving the productivity of sinter machine, through increased permeability of sinter bed is successfully achieved through implementation of an innovatively designed and developed, “Magnetic Charging Chute” at Sinter Plant no. 2 of Rourkela Steel Plant. The induced magnetic force on the charged materials while the charge materials dropping down through the charge chute has improved the permeability of sinter bed through an unique method of segregating the para-magnetic materials and the finer materials of the charge materials to top layer of sinter bed along with improved size-wise segregation of charge materials.

40|$|Rational thought {{interpreted}} architecture {{simply as}} a container for activities, a machine that absorbed energy from within, different separated pieces of a single mechanism. Rational urban planning is thus rooted in Elementarism and the separation of functions. Modern architecture dismantles the rigid relationship between interior space and walls, modern urban planning considered the urban space, releasing it from the ties of dependency that governed the relationship between roads, streets and the constructed block. (…) the traditional compact city, where every part assumed a form in relation to its neighbour, creating squares and urban fabrics, went on dangerously subdividing and breaking up on account of an over simplistic application if the principles of modern urban planning. (cit. Josep Maria Montaner, Sistemas arquitectònicos contemporaneous, Editorial Gustavo Gili, SL, Barcellona, 2008). The additive approach had served to dissolve, or separate the urban space, raising planning to an abstract state which distanced the architect’s attention from the authentic, and conceiving {{of the city as}} a mere composition of volumes within the space according to the territorial scale, where the space of the lived-in area was an almost discounted consequence, perhaps substituting the notion of neutral space to that of place. The heated argument since the post-World War II period, which resulted in an affirmation of the crisis at the CIAM 9, refocuses attention on the idea of habitat as a system of spaces, an articulation of the private, the public and the semi-public; connected to spaces by the limits created by flexibility of use, by unclear borders, by complex extensions. The habitat is a system only inasmuch as it is a union of heterogeneous elements on a different scale which are inter-related according to an internal organization which results in the strategic adaptation to the complexity of the context and which creates, or builds a whole which can’t be explained by the sum of its parts. There are no isolated objects within, but all the elements are assimilated and melt into the fabric; every part is present and acts according to a role and in continuity with the others. The house is a “half-open, half-closed ” being, a continuous threshold, a space that is in transition in which exchanges take place and a labyrinthine style complexity appears. A topological labyrinth, the place for living is thus an individual organization wherein the dweller appropriates the space. The logical progression of this phenomenological concept of the house leads us to the relationship between public and private where we find a scaled reproduction mechanism which from the microcosm of the variety of the house Abstract recalls genuine and authentic planning models. This is what the architects at CIAM at Dubrovnik (’ 56) meant when they sparked polemics by comparing the vitality of the Kasbah with its labyrinthine spatial organization to the purity of modern prismically-limited visions. The Kasbah, its traditional fabric, the rural villages of the Mediterranean demonstrate the imprecision and mingling of limits and functions, the compact nature and continuity of the mass of blocks of houses that surrounds and combines spaces of different types and creates relationships of osmotic permeability, density and porosity in complicated ways. In Modern architecture, the urban matrix experiments with a radical transformation in which one passes from a constructed fabric which functions as a continuous solid, in which open spaces appear as sculpted figures extracted from a mouldable mass, to a creation based on isolated convex, which generate a continuous void, in which the open space ceases to have a precise form and which instead becomes a background, while the role of the figure or shape is taken over by buildings that appear as isolated fragments. Therefore we are faced with a radical topological transformation of the urban space. The lesson of the traditional fabrics and their systematic clarity, their irrational components that are in a certain way spontaneous in defining dimensions, proportions and filters, is revealed as a determining factor in offering consolidated solutions entirely appropriate to everyday needs and functions. From a rationalistic approach which breaks down into clearly defined and juxtaposed sections and elements, one passes towards a more intuitive approach (phenomenological) which interprets and reads in the mixture of the system (that is, within the compact and solid system of the settlement) those elements that go to make it up and which express it even though there is no sense or solution of continuity. The Kasbah - whose continuous evolution derives from no rational control or logic in any way - is a compact system, a <b>porous</b> <b>mass,</b> an organism made up of penetrating micro-systems, transits and stasis. It is an authentic machine for living, where the term machine is meant in its widest sense as an organized and perfectly functioning unit. If within the Athens Charter a clear call was made for the definition of clearly defined spaces in terms of limits and functions, the position of Team 10 underlines imprecision as the added value of space and place. A concept of new and radical space is thus defined, the threshold, a spatiality of intermediate scale which becomes enriched through the possibility of usage, of personalization and colonization by virtue of its “middle space” nature, its functional vagueness, its measured yet informal character, by its encircling and deceiving urban dimension. Thresholds are the spaces that regulate the permeability of compact and dense fabrics, they are identifiable where urban solidity opens itself up to possibilities of penetration, where the pores of the building become shadowy places favourable to the dialectic stasis between individual and collective; where the characteristics of the semi-closed, half-closed and filtered spaces create relational balances, dynamics of controlled sharing, discreet dialogues with that which is outside the private family microcosm. The threshold is the structure of space that regulates the dialogue with the rest (the complex) and itself becomes a place for living, a spatial device at the centre of the family background and a hinge between individual and collective. An intermediate space, a void for transition and meeting. The threshold is an imprecise limit, it is a space marked out for use, from the private fixtures, an expressed yet empty area; it is a third party that is neither private nor public, it has an in-between nature. Once again the Smithsons state that architectural reflection should start from the smallest scale, which means starting from the relationship between house and street, home and road, and thus this research is aimed at reflecting on the architectural and urban devices which make up the basis of this relationship. With the intervention of Team X {{it is now clear that}} living is not a fact confined to an apartment or dwelling, a private and individual space, but that it is exactly that by virtue of its extension and presence within the urban context, its links with public spaces. A reading of urban fabrics, and the Kasbahs in particular as organized systems reveals them as design tools in the conception of places for living not as individual architectural facts, building events in which the exclusive nature of the house and its external projections are detailed, but as systems for and of places, environments, objects that on different scales articulate the context of the habitat...|$|E
40|$|Group IV {{transition}} metal carbides are promising materials for high temperature structural application, {{due to their}} unique sets of properties such as high melting temperature, high temperature strength, hardness, elastic modulus, wear and corrosion resistance, metal-like thermal and electrical conductivity and thermal shock resistance. This group includes zir-conium carbide, which, along with its composites, are potential candidates for applications such as nose cones for re-entry vehicle, engines, wear resistant parts and in nuclear fuel cladding. Such structural applications demand high strength material with minimal flaws, {{in order to achieve}} the required reliability. Attainment of high strength calls for fully dense material with as small a grain size as possible. Producing fully dense zirconium carbide requires very high temperature, which is a direct consequence of its high melting point. Higher processing temperatures increase grain size, thereby also causing a loss in strength, along with the increased cost. Therefore, there is always a driving force to produce such a material in fully densified form at as low a temperature as possible. There {{have been a number of}} studies on processing and densification of zirconium carbide. Pressureless sintering of zirconium carbide requires temperature of 2400 oC- 3000 oC to reach reasonably high density. At such high temperatures, abnormal grain growth limits the final density, as pores get entrapped inside the grains. Hot pressing of zirconium carbide also requires upwards of 2000 oC to reach high density and is the primary route to produce densified zirconium carbide product. Reactive hot pressing (RHP), is a relatively new processing approach. Here, the reaction between zirconium and carbon to produce zirconium carbide and the densification of the <b>porous</b> <b>mass,</b> occurs simultaneously. Study on reactive hot pressing of zirconium carbide have shown that, it is possible to achieve very high density at much lower temperatures 1600 oC. Clearly, reactive processing is an exciting new technique to process zirconium carbide. However, there has been a lack of studies to understand why it provides better densification than conventional hot pressing. Such understanding is of paramount importance, as it can lead to better optimization of RHP and perhaps even lower the process temperature further. The objective of the present study is to understand the densification process in RHP of zirconium carbide through systematic and carefully designed experiments. A model of reactive hot pressing is also constructed to get more insight into the phenomenon. 0. 1 	Pressureless Reaction Sintering of Zirconium Car-bide Pressureless reaction sintering (RS) of zirconium carbide is studied to understand the role of stoichiometry and zirconium metal in densification. ZrC of four different stoichiometries are chosen for these sets of experiments which are conducted in vacuum at 1200 oC and 1600 oC for 1 hour to understand the role of stoichiometry. One sample of pure Zr is also sintered to elucidate the role of zirconium in densification. After reaction sintering, all the samples are characterized by density measurement, x-ray diffraction and microstructure, using scanning electron microscopy. After pressureless sintering at 1600 oC, zirconium metal reaches the highest relative density of ~ 95 %. Densification decreases monotonically with increasing stoichiometry. Zr+ 0. 5 C composition reaches the next best relative density (of 90 %), while Zr+ 0. 67 C composition shows much lower densification. The other two compositions, Zr+ 0. 8 C and Zr+C, in contrast, display de-densification rather than densification. Since the pure zirconium sample reaches high density, it can, in principle, help in densification of the mixed powders before getting fully reacted. Non-stoichiometric carbides also exhibit higher diffusivity of carbon, which aids the densification and the greater the deviation from stoichiometry, the smaller the deleterious effects of de-densification from reaction. This troika of factors is responsible for the substantially better densification in non-stoichiometric carbide, compared to stoichiometric carbide. 0. 2 	Reactive Hot Pressing of Zirconium and Carbon Reactive hot pressing of zirconium carbide is explored with the emphasis on finding the underlying densification mechanism. The earlier proposed densification mechanism for RHP is the plastic flow of transient non-stoichiometric carbide. To differentiate the effect of transient phases from that of zirconium, RHP is carried out at 800 oC. At this low temperature, transient phases cannot take part in plastic flow and subsequent densification. Thus, any densi cation at this temperature can be totally attributed to zirconium and the role of zirconium thus can be separated from that of transient phases. A combination of RHP and RS experiments are carried out at 1200 oC to better understand the phenomenon. Again, ZrC carbide of four different stoichiometries are investigated in this RHP study. After RHP at 800 oC, all the four different ZrC compositions reached more than 90 % RD through plastic flow of the Zr leading to a continuous matrix with embedded graphite particles. Since the reaction remains incomplete at this temperature, it is clear that Zirconium alone is responsible for enabling densification at such a low temperature. It is therefore argued that any unreacted Zr would, at higher temperature, be able to drive densification even more. Thus, zirconium does not only participate in densification; it is a dominant factor enabling low temperature densification. Pressureless reaction sintering at 1200 oC following the RHP at 800 oC, results in de-densi fication, as the reaction between zirconium and carbon occurs with significant volume shrinkage. Since such shrinkage increases with stoichiometry of the carbide, the higher stoichiometry carbides are more susceptible to de-densification. RHP at 1200 oC, mostly completes the reaction, but only ZrC 0 : 5 reaches near theoretical density. Thus, the final density of the fully reacted mixture is arrived at through a combination of processes in which the more stoichiometric carbides suffer from not only the smaller metal content but also a greater volume shrinkage during reaction. Thus, ZrC 0 : 5 reaches 99 % RD whereas ZrC reaches only 85 % RD. The interplay between these two processes may be controlled by a two step RHP begin-ning at 800 oC followed by a ramp up to 1200 oC. The higher RD achieved at 800 C results in a higher final density for all the four compositions. Thus, two step RHP is a novel way to get better densification in RHP of zirconium carbide. 0. 3 	Hot Pressing of Zirconium Carbide Powders of Different Stoichiometry In the literature, densification in RHP is mostly attributed to the presence of transient non-stoichiometric carbides. To examine this hypothesis, ZrC of three different stoichiometries are prepared and then subjected to hot pressing at the same temperature and pressure as the previous RHP experiments (i. e. 1200 oC and 40 MPa for 30 min). After the hot pressing experiments, ZrC 0 : 5 composition shows significant densification (95 % RD), whereas ZrC 0 : 67 composition shows very limited densification (70 % RD) and ZrC composition shows little or no densification (50 % RD). Evidently, the transient phase formed with stoichiometry close to ZrC 0 : 5 can certainly contribute substantially to densification. But for the more carbon-rich compositions, the transient phases do not appear to play a significant role and the benefit of RHP, wherein ZrC can reach 90 % RD, must come from the contribution of metal plasticity. 0. 4 	Reactive Hot Pressing of Zirconium and Zirconium Carbide Two limiting factors for densification during RHP are, de-densification (courtesy of the reaction) and the gradual increase in volume fraction of a rigid, non-sintering phase. To investigate the role of these factors further, two compositions of mixed metal and carbide powders, namely Zr+ZrC and 0. 5 Zr+ZrC, are subjected to RHP. When reaction is complete, the compositions after RHP will correspond to ZrC 0 : 5 and ZrC 0 : 67, respectively, but with the following difference with respect to the metal-carbon mixtures investigated earlier: these new compositions do not experience de-densification due to reaction and they contain significantly more amount of hard phase (53 and 69 %) in the starting composition than their zirconium and carbon mixture counterparts i. e. Zr+ 0. 5 C and Zr+ 0. 67 C (16 and 20 %). These two compositions are subjected to the same process schedules, i. e., RHP at 800 oC, pressureless reaction sintering at 1200 oC following RHP at 800 oC and two step 800 oC and 1200 oC RHP. After 800 oC RHP, Zr+ZrC and 0. 5 Zr+ZrC compositions reach much lower density than Zr+ 0. 5 C and Zr+ 0. 67 C compositions as a direct consequence of the larger amount of hard phase hindering densification at the lower temperature. After the 1200 oC pressureless sintering following the RHP at 1200 oC, the RD of Zr+ZrC and 0. 5 Zr+ZrC compositions increase (which is opposite to the behaviour of Zr+ 0. 5 C and Zr+ 0. 67 C com-positions) as they do not su er from reaction derived de-densification. After two step RHP, Zr+ZrC and 0. 5 Zr+ZrC compositions reach a final RD that is higher than the Zr+ 0. 5 C and Zr+ 0. 67 C compositions, even though after the first RHP at 800 oC, they were much less densified. Thus, the absence of de-densification during reaction is able to more than compensate for the increase in hard phase content. 0. 5 	Reactive Hot Pressing: Low temperature process-ing route Based on the major factors of densification identified earlier, it was investigated whether RHP temperatures could be brought down further while being supplemented by a free sintering step to complete the reaction without de-densification. From a practical standpoint, such a process would allow dense products to be made by hot pressing with low temperature dies and fixtures while carrying out a more economical pressureless sintering at higher temperatures Therefore, Metal-carbide mixtures, Zr+ZrC and Ti+ZrC, are chosen, along with a temperature of 900 C which is above the allotropic phase transformation temperature for Zr around 880 oC, thereby utilizing a zirconium phase that is softer than the hexagonal Zr. For completion of reaction, pressureless reaction sintering is done at 1300 oC and 1400 oC. It is found that after 1400 oC reaction sintering, both the compositions reach almost full density and the Ti+ZrC composition also shows a higher hardness (13 vs 10 GPa) than the Zr+ZrC composition, due to the formation of a binary carbide with consequent solid solution hardening. 0. 6 	Effect of Particle Size on Reactive Hot Pressing During RHP, premature exhaustion of zirconium by reaction can limit densification. One way to have better densification is to slow down the reaction, so that significant amount of densification takes place before the metal zirconium is exhausted. One way to reduce reaction rates is to increase particle size. Larger particles are expected to slow down the reaction without affecting sintering, as densification is controlled by power law creep of Zr which is grain size independent. Because of lack of availability of Zr with different particle sizes, two different graphite particle sizes, i. e. 7 - 10 m and 50 - 60 m, were studied and it was shown that after 1200 oC RHP, indeed the larger particle size improves densification. 0. 7 	Modelling of Reactive Hot Pressing Reactive hot pressing is a complicated phenomenon, and to get an insight and also to optimize the parameters, the availability of a computational model is of paramount importance. Keeping that in mind, a model of RHP has been constructed based on four different parts, namely: 1. Densification of zirconium under pressure 2. Reaction of zirconium and carbon 3. The constraint on sintering from a rigid phase and, finally, 4. The volume contraction during reaction. The model uses published data for the 4 steps and shows reasonable qualitative and quantitative agreement with the experimental results. Further experiments are done with the model to optimize the processing parameters. Results from the virtual experiments consolidates our earlier conviction gained from experimental results, by showing zirconium is the principal factor in densification and exhaustion of zirconium coupled with reaction derived de-densification prevent the higher stoichiometric carbide from achieving full densification. It also shows, RHP gives best densification when reaction is 70 - 80 % complete. So two step RHP where the first RHP will only complete the reaction 70 - 80 %, and a final RHP at temperature which will complete the reaction, will possibly be the way to achieve best densification. 0. 8 	Conclusions The study on RHP of zirconium carbide led to the following conclusions: •	Zirconium plays the most crucial role in densification. •	Transient phases only play a role when the final stoichiometry of RHPed carbide is close to that of ZrC 0 : 5. •	De-densification from reaction prevents higher stoichiometric carbide from reaching full densification. •	Two step RHP, with one RHP at lower temperature at which reaction will remain incomplete, and the other at higher temperature to complete the reaction, yields best densification. •	For lower stoichiometric carbide (ZrC 0 : 5,ZrC 0 : 67), full densification can be achieved at 1200 oC. For higher stoichiometric carbide, even though large amount of densification upward of 90 % RD is achieved at 1200 oC, full densification will be out of reach. •	RHP shows better densification than conventional hot pressing for all stoichiometries...|$|E

The layer underlying all others contains eithet: IA, pyroxene needles + olivine + clumps of hedenbergite and andradite; IB, olivine doughnuts; or IC, rectangular olivine crystals. The next layer outward, II, contains tiny (~ 5 pm) olivine plates and Layer III large (S- 10 am) olivine laths. The final layer, IV, occurs as clumps of andradite + hed-enbergite surrounded by magnesium-rich pyroxene needles. It separates Layer III from the Allende matrix which is more poorly sorted and more sulfide-rich than Layer III. Nepheline and iron sulfide are common constituents of most layers, the latter being particularly fine-grained and abundant in Layer II.

40|$|Heap {{leaching}} {{is one of}} {{the methods}} being used to recover metal from low grade ore deposits. The main problem faced during heap leaching is the migration of fine grained particles through the heap, forming impermeable beds which result in poor solution flow. The poor solution flow leads to less contact between the leach solution and the ore, resulting in low recovery rates. Agglomeration of ore into coarse, <b>porous</b> <b>masses</b> prevents fine particles from migrating and clogging the spaces and channels between the larger ore particles. Currently, there is one facility in the United States which uses agglomeration. This operation agglomerates their ore using leach solution (raffinate), but is still experiencing undesirable metal recovery from the heaps due to agglomerate breakdown. The use of a binder, in addition to the leach solution, during agglomeration would help to produce stronger agglomerates that did not break down during processing. However, there are no known binders that will work satisfactorily in the acidic environment of a heap, at a reasonable cost. As a result, operators of many facilities see a large loss of process efficiency due to their inability to take advantage of agglomeration. Increasing copper recovery in heap leaching by the use of binders and agglomeration would result in a significant decrease in the amount of energy consumed. Assuming that 70 % of all the leaching heaps would convert to using agglomeration technology, as much as 1. 64 * 10 {sup 12 } BTU per year would be able to be saved if a 25 % increase in copper recovery was experienced, which is equivalent to saving approximately 18 % of the energy currently being used in leaching heaps. For every week a leach cycle was decreased, a savings of as much as 1. 23 * 10 {sup 11 } BTU per week would result. This project has identified several acid-resistant binders and agglomeration procedures. These binders and experimental procedures will be able to be used for use in improving the energy efficiency of heap leaching...|$|R
