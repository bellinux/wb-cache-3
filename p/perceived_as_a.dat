5|$|In 2005, 42% of all {{households}} and 76% of {{households in the}} top quintile had two or more income earners. As a result, there was a considerable discrepancy between household and personal income. Recent studies, {{such as the one}} conducted by Harvard professor Elizabeth Warren, have shown that the average American household needs two incomes in order to live what is commonly <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> middle-class lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|Later events, {{such as the}} Boston Tea Party, further {{illustrated}} the crumbling relationship between Britain and its colonies. Although five years passed between the massacre and outright revolution, and direct connections between the massacre and the later war are (according to historian Neil Langley York) somewhat tenuous, it is widely <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> significant event leading to the violent rebellion that followed.|$|E

5|$|The {{campaign}} was <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> decisive Israeli victory, causing reorganizations in the Syrian high command {{and the birth}} of heroic tales in Israel.

5|$|And the Band Played On: Politics, People, and the AIDS Epidemic is a 1987 book by San Francisco Chronicle {{journalist}} Randy Shilts. The book {{chronicles the}} discovery and {{spread of the}} human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) with a special emphasis on government indifference and political infighting—specifically in the United States—to what was then <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> specifically gay disease. Shilts' premise is that AIDS was allowed to happen: while the disease {{is caused by a}} biological agent, incompetence and apathy toward those initially affected allowed its spread to become much worse.|$|E

5|$|Blas Fajardo Ople (February 3, 1927 – December 14, 2003) was a Filipino {{journalist}} and politician who held several high-ranking {{positions in the}} executive and legislative branches of the Philippine government, including as Senate President from 1999 to 2000, and as Secretary of Foreign Affairs from 2002 until his death. <b>Perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> leftist-nationalist {{at the onset of}} his career in public service, Ople was, in his final years, a vocal supporter for allowing a limited United States military presence in the Philippines, and for American initiatives in the War on Terror including the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq.|$|E
5|$|DragonFly {{originally}} {{used the}} FreeBSD Ports collection as its official package management system, but {{starting with the}} 1.4 release switched to NetBSD's pkgsrc system, which was <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> way of lessening {{the amount of work}} needed for third-party software availability. Eventually, maintaining compatibility with pkgsrc proved to require more effort than was initially anticipated, so the project created DPorts, an overlay on top of the FreeBSD Ports collection.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before his}} {{accession}} {{to the throne}} of Belgium in 1865, the future king Leopold II began lobbying leading Belgian politicians to create a colonial empire in the Far East or Africa, which would expand and enhance Belgian prestige. Politically, however, colonisation was unpopular in Belgium as it was <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> risky and expensive gamble with no obvious benefit {{to the country and}} his many attempts to persuade politicians met with little success.|$|E

5|$|Franz Ferdinand was an {{advocate}} of increased federalism and widely believed to favor trialism, under which Austria-Hungary would be reorganized by combining the Slavic lands within the Austro-Hungarian empire into a third crown. A Slavic kingdom {{could have been a}} bulwark against Serb irredentism, and Franz Ferdinand was therefore <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> threat by those same irredentists. Princip later stated to the court that preventing Franz Ferdinand's planned reforms was one of his motivations.|$|E
5|$|In 1891, German {{botanist}} Otto Kuntze published Revisio generum plantarum, {{his response}} to what he <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> lack of method in existing nomenclatural practice. He revived the genus Atylus {{on the grounds of}} priority, and correctly made the combination Atylus anemonifolius. However, Kuntze's revisionary program was not accepted by the majority of botanists. Ultimately, the genus Isopogon was nomenclaturally conserved over Atylus by the International Botanical Congress of 1905.|$|E

Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Serbia similarly received offers at the April 2008 Bucharest summit. While their neighbors both requested and accepted the dialogue programme, Serbia's offer was presented to guarantee the possibility of future ties with the alliance.|$|E

In a memorandum sent to President Dwight D.

5|$|Not {{long after}} the conquest of Egypt in 30 BCE regular {{commerce}} began between the Romans and Asia, marked by the Roman appetite for silk cloth coming from the Far East, which was then resold to the Romans by the Parthians. The Roman Senate {{tried in vain to}} prohibit the wearing of silk, for economic reasons as well as moral ones.

5|$|Obvious Child {{originated}} as a 2009 {{short film}} {{which was written}} by Robespierre, Anna Bean and Karen Maine, and also starred Slate in the main role.
