5000|$|The {{similarity}} of the <b>partial</b> <b>unit</b> to the K ration was a chief {{reason for the}} proposed revision of the 10-in-1 in 1945. The revised 10-in-1 was intended for use {{during and after the}} 1945 planned attack on Japan during World War II. It was planned to eliminate the unit ration concept, and to assemble the entire ration on the basis of three group meals rather than two group meals and one individual luncheon package. Although it was recognized that the overall weight of the ration would be increased thereby, it was felt that the added weight would be offset by the increased acceptability and nutritional value which a greater variety of components would provide. The end of the war prevented realization of such a plan in the 10-in-1, leaving a surplus of food. Through the form of CARE Packages, the humanitarian group CARE provided a means to transfer the ration surplus to those starving in Europe. Over 300 million rations, costing about 85 cents each, were procured under the 10-in-1 title from mid-1943 to the end of World War II. No other group ration was procured during that period. Hence, in actuality as well as nomenclature, [...] "Ration, 10-in-1" [...] was the final small-group ration of World War II.|$|E

40|$|Although the {{successive}} cancelation (SC) algorithm {{works well for}} very long polar codes, its error performance for shorter polar codes is much worse. Several SC based list decoding algorithms have been proposed to improve the error performances of both long and short polar codes. A significant step of SC based list decoding algorithms is the updating of partial sums for all decoding paths. In this paper, we first proposed a lazy copy partial sum computation algorithm for SC based list decoding algorithms. Instead of copying partial sums directly, our lazy copy algorithm copies indices of partial sums. Based on our lazy copy algorithm, we propose a hybrid <b>partial</b> sum computation <b>unit</b> architecture, which employs both registers and memories so that the overall area efficiency is improved.

40|$|While {{there is}} good reason to expect crude oil {{production}} to be non-linear, previous studies that have examined the stochastic properties of crude oil production have assumed that crude oil production follows a linear process. If crude oil production is a non-linear process, conventional unit root tests, which assume linear and systematic adjustment, could interpret departure from linearity as permanent stochastic disturbances. The objective of this paper is to test for non-linearities and unit roots in crude oil production. To realize our objective, this study applies a threshold autoregressive model with an autoregressive unit root to monthly crude oil production for 17 OPEC and non-OPEC countries over the period January 1973 to December 2007. Specifically, first we test for the presence of non-linearities (threshold effects) in the production of crude oil in two regimes. Second, we test for a unit root against a non-linear stationary process in two regimes and a <b>partial</b> <b>unit</b> root process when the unit root is present in one regime only. We find that crude oil production is characterized by threshold effects.

The aim of this work is to describe the main characteristics of acute reactions reported in a Brazilian transfusion service. A preprinted report form was used to evaluate the age and sex of the transfusion recipients, blood component requested, medical specialty involved and transfusion-related signs and symptoms, transfusionists performed a direct observation during the transfusion and in a period of four hours following transfusion. Data were prospectively collected for 90 days from 30 hospitals and health facilities supplied by the the Service of Hematology and Hemotherapy of São José dos Campos. Acute reactions were recognized as febrile nonhemolytic, allergic, fluid overload, transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), anaphylatic and metabolic reactions. In a total of 8, 378 transfusions, 46 acute reactions were recorded (5. 5 per 1000 units transfused, 28 febrile nonhemolytic, 12 allergic, 5 anaphylatic and 1 fluid overload).
