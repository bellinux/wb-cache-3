5|$|In late 1933-early 1934, a major strain {{was placed}} on German-Japanese {{relations}} when the German ambassador to Japan, when Ambassador Herbert von Dirksen appointed Ferdinand Heye, a Nazi Party member and a disreputable German businessman convicted by a Chinese court of opium smuggling in 1927 the Special German Trade Commissioner for Manchukuo. The Japanese attached much importance {{to the question of}} recognizing Manchukuo, which was seen as a litmus test for whatever one was a true friend of Japan or of China. Heye attempted with the support of Dirksen to have the Japanese give him a monopoly of exporting soybeans from Manchukuo, in exchange for which he promised to have Germany recognize Manchukuo. The ambitious Heye, having won the friendship of the Kwantung Army by <b>promising</b> <b>that</b> he would have the Reich recognize Manchukuo, then attempted to use his position as German Trade Commissioner to Manchukuo to secure a monopoly on all German investments in Manchukuo. The attempts of Heye and Dirksen to have Germany recognize Manchukuo involved them in a dispute with Neurath who preferred to keep Germany's special relationship it had established with the Kuomintang regime in China going, and who knew well that the Chinese would be extremely offended if Germany recognized Manchukuo. The Heye affair caused much bad feelings on both sides, and was ended in February 1935 with the victory of Neurath when Hitler disallowed Heye and his promises he made.|$|E

Proto Man appears and immediately destroys these plans. Wily then demands Bass to destroy Proto Man, but Bass is unsure. It was then Proto Man tells Bass that although he is a strong robot of free will, he can never defeat his rival because he has nothing for which to fight. Bass doesn't care and forces Proto Man to leave, saying that he will still destroy Mega Man to prove his cause. Mega Man returns home where his sister Roll presents him a letter from King, who has somehow escaped the destruction of his castle.

5|$|The Czech Catholics, {{who were}} led by Zdeněk of Šternberk, joined forces with Matthias in February 1469. Their united troops were encircled at Vilémov by George of Poděbrady's army. In fear of being captured, Matthias opened {{negotiations}} with his former father-in-law. They met in a nearby hovel, where Matthias persuaded George of Poděbrady to sign an armistice <b>promising</b> <b>that</b> he would mediate a reconciliation between the moderate Hussites and the Holy See. Their next meeting took place in Olomouc in April. Here the papal legates came forward with demands including {{the appointment of a}} Catholic Archbishop to the See of Prague, which could not be accepted by George of Poděbrady. The Czech Catholic Estates elected Matthias King of Bohemia in Olomouc on 3 May but he was never crowned. Moravia, Silesia and Lusatia soon accepted his rule but Bohemia proper remained faithful to George of Poděbrady. The Estates of Bohemia even acknowledged the right of Vladislaus Jagiello, the eldest son of Casimir IV of Poland, to succeed king George of Poděbrady.|$|E
5|$|Theramenes' first {{appearance}} in the historical record comes with {{his involvement in the}} oligarchic coup of 411 BC. In the wake of the Athenian defeat in Sicily, revolts began to break out among Athens' subject states in the Aegean Sea and the Peace of Nicias fell apart; the Peloponnesian War resumed in full by 412 BC. In this context, a number of Athenian aristocrats, led by Peisander and with Theramenes prominent among their ranks, began to conspire to overthrow the city's democratic government. This intrigue was initiated by the exiled nobleman Alcibiades, who was at that time acting as an assistant to the Persian satrap Tissaphernes. Claiming that he had great influence with Tissaphernes, Alcibiades promised to return to Athens, bringing Persian support with him, if the democracy that had exiled him were replaced with an oligarchy. Accordingly, a number of trierarchs and other leaders of the Athenian army at Samos began planning the overthrow of the democracy. They eventually dispatched Peisander to Athens, where, by <b>promising</b> <b>that</b> the return of Alcibiades and an alliance with Persia would follow if the Athenians would replace their democracy with an oligarchy, he persuaded the Athenian ecclesia to send him as an emissary to Alcibiades, authorized to make whatever arrangements were necessary.|$|E
5|$|When Philadelphia Media Holdings L.L.C. (PMH) {{bought the}} paper in 2006, Brian P. Tierney and the {{business}} people behind PMH signed a pledge <b>promising</b> <b>that</b> they would not influence {{the content of the}} paper. Tierney, a Republican activist who had represented many local groups in the Philadelphia area, had criticized The Inquirer in the past on behalf of his clients. One of Tierney's clients had been the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia, which he had represented during the Cipriano affair. PMH membership also included Bruce E. Toll, vice chairman of Toll Brothers Inc. Tierney said that the group was aware that the fastest way to ruin its investment in The Inquirer was to threaten the paper's editorial independence. The 2012 sale of Philadelphia Media Network to six local business leaders also led to concern of conflict of interest. The new owners, which included New Jersey Democratic fundraiser George Norcross III, media entrepreneur H. F. Lenfest, former New Jersey Nets owner Lewis Katz, and CEO of Liberty Property Trust and chairman of the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce William Hankowsky, pledged not to influence the content of the paper.|$|E
