50|$|There was a lag {{of about}} forty years between {{disclosure}} of PCN hazards and government regulation. In the U.S. exposure to PCNs was drastically reduced after 1976, following {{enactment of the}} Toxic Substances Control Act. Major equipment manufacturers banned PCNs in their products, and major PCN producers discontinued operations. By 1983 worldwide PCN production had almost halted except for small amounts used in testing and research. Until recent years duPont produced a synthetic rubber, Neoprene FB, made in Northern Ireland using <b>pentachloronaphthalene.</b> Today PCNs are offered commercially by only a few companies, including Ukrgeochem of Simferopol, Ukraine.|$|E
