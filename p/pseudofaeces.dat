50|$|Pseudofeces or <b>pseudofaeces</b> are a {{specialized}} method of expulsion that filter-feeding bivalve mollusks (and filter-feeding gastropod mollusks) use {{in order to}} get rid of suspended particles such as particles of grit which cannot be used as food, and which have been rejected by the animal. The rejected particles are wrapped in mucus, and are then expelled without having passed through the digestive tract. Thus, although they may closely resemble the mollusk's real feces, they are not actually feces, hence the name pseudofeces, meaning false feces.|$|E
50|$|Rhoads and Germano (1982) {{developed}} {{a list of}} parameters taken from SPI {{in an effort to}} reduce and quantify specific environmental attributes and make them amenable to traditional statistical analysis. Their list has been modified and qualified throughout the literature, but is summarised in Table 1. A few of these parameters can be calibrated and are reproducible in a variety of habitats. Gross sediment texture is probably the least controvertible and most immediately informative parameter for producing benthic habitat maps and identifying sediment-modifying impacts. The apparent redox potential discontinuity (ARPD) can also be a powerful assessment parameter. For example, one of the reported effects of sustained aquaculture activity on coastal environments is the deposition and accumulation of organic-rich sediments near the production site whether from the faeces and <b>pseudofaeces</b> of shellfish or uneaten food and excretion of fin fish. This can result in an increase in oxygen consumption by the sediment, formation of anoxic sediments, and the production and release of harmful gases such as methane, H2S, and CO2 which can affect the water column, benthic macrofauna (Pocklington et al. 1994), and meiofauna (Mazzola et al. 1999). The relationships between infauna, suboxic sediments, and organic enrichment are well documented (Weston 1990; Rees et al. 1992; Hargrave et al. 1997). This system is much like that described by Pearson and Rosenberg (1978) as presented in Figure 4. Rhoads and Germano (1982) took this concept one step further by assigning categories to the various successional stages in an attempt to integrate the biotic and geochemical responses to organic enrichment. To be used reliably, successional stage determinations must be made within the biological and physical context of each study, are necessarily subjective, and are unlikely to be more than broadly informative between analysts. Similarly, the majority of parameters presented in Table 1 are site- and study-specific. Acting in a similar manner to a cone penetrometer, the SPI wedge penetration depth into soft sediments may be generally useful as a proxy for sediment fabric if calibrated, but results will be sensitive to differences in equipment and deployment.|$|E
40|$|The feeding {{behaviour}} of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) was {{studied in the}} laboratory on different combinations of food, including a green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) and toxic and non-toxic strains of the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa. 2. The highest clearance rate of phytoplankton by zebra mussels was found when the mussels were feeding on a mixture of Chlamydomonas and non-toxic Microcystis, the lowest on a mixture of Chlamydomonas and toxic Microcystis. 3. The differences found in the clearance rates between food combinations can be partly explained by the production of <b>pseudofaeces</b> containing live phytoplankton cells. Zebra mussels expelled significantly more live phytoplankton cells {{in the presence of}} toxic Microcystis than in the presence of non-toxic Microcystis. The <b>pseudofaeces</b> contained predominantly live Chlamydomonas cells. Proportionately much less live Microcystis cells were encountered in the <b>pseudofaeces.</b> 4. Consequently, grazing of zebra mussels on a combination of Chlamydomonas and Microcystis may finally result in a dominance of Chlamydomonas over Microcystis. The presence of toxic Microcystis may even strengthen this shift. ...|$|E

Two of the seston concentrations were below, and two above, the threshold at which <b>pseudofaeces</b> were produced. Measurements of physiological traits (filtration rates, <b>pseudofaeces</b> production, selection efficiency, absorp tion efficiency, absorption rates and rates of oxygen consumption) were made after 2 days and, {{for two of the}} seston concentrations, also after 12 days. When fed at a high concentra tion of seston of low organic content, the mussels increased their filtration rate, rejected a higher proportion of filtered material as <b>pseudofaeces,</b> and increased the efficiency with which filtered matter of higher organic content was selected for ingestion; this resulted in a constancy of the relationship between ingestion rate and the concentration of partkulate organic matter, regardless of differences in seston organic content. Between 2 and 12 d, the mussels increased absorption rates for organics, primarily by increasing absorption effi ciency, both for total organics and for the carbohydrate component of the diet. We suggest that these responses to changes in the food environment comprise physiological adjust ments which result in higher net rates of absorption than would be predicted from considerations only of the organic / inorganic ratio of the suspended particles and assump tions of a non-compensating feeding behaviour...|$|E

Laboratory studies were conducted using rehydrated microalgae, Spongiococcum excentricum, at 2 mg l⁻¹ to assess the effects of body size (dry soft tissue weight) on the feeding and energetics of juvenile and adult S. commercialis of 2 n and 3 n ploidy. The parameters clearance rate (CR), absorption efficiency (abs. eff.), <b>pseudofaeces</b> production (PF), respiration (R) and ammonia excretion (E) were measured to determine the energy available for growth and reproduction, defined as scope for growth (SFG). Both diploids and triploids of juvenile and adult S. commercialis {{were found to have}} similar SFG, being 4. 56 J h⁻¹ for diploid and 4. 81 J h⁻¹ for triploid 0. 01 -g oysters, and 21. 3 J h⁻¹ for diploid and 20. 8 J h⁻¹ for triploid 1 -g oysters. The only significant differences between the ploidy conditions were in PF and E in adult oysters. However, since PF and E were only minor components of the energy budget, they did not result in any significant difference to SFG. Abs. eff. was inversely related to size in triploid oysters, but not related to size in diploids. CR, PF, absorbed energy (AE), R and E were significantly related to size in exponential relationships. For CR, AE and R, the exponent was low, about 0. 3 – 0. 4, indicating marked declines in size-specific rates with increasing oyster size, e. g. AE declined from 605 J g− 1 h⁻¹ for 0. 01 -g to 31. 6 J g− 1 h⁻¹ for 1 -g diploid oysters. The exponents were negative for PF, indicating a marked decline in relative production of <b>pseudofaeces</b> with size, e. g. PF declined from 23 % of filtered particles by 0. 01 -g oysters to 6 % by 1 -g diploid oysters. The inorganic content of the <b>pseudofaeces</b> (25 – 33 %) was significantly higher than in the food (5. 6 %) indicating selectivity during the feeding and ingestion processes. While this study found no differences in the influence of size on SFG in diploid and triploid S. commercialis at a standard level of food, {{it is possible that the}} feeding and energetics of diploid and triploid oysters vary according to food regime.

Previous experiments related to AZA accumulation in blue mussels upon direct feeding with A. spinosum revealed increased mussel mortality and had negative effects on {{the thickness of the}} digestive gland tubules. Therefore we conducted follow up experiments in order to study effects of A. spinosum on mussel feeding behaviour. Individual assessment of mussel feeding time activity (FTA), clearance rate (CR), filtration rate (TFR), absorption rate (AR), faeces and <b>pseudofaeces</b> production were carried out on mussel fed either toxic (A. spinosum) or non-toxic (Isochrisis aff. galbana (T-Iso)) diets. Furthermore, AZA accumulation and biotransformation in mussels were followed using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). A. spinosum had a significant effect on mussel feeding behaviour compared to T-Iso: CR was lower by a factor of 6, FTA by a factor of 5, TFR by a factor of 3 and AR even decreased to negative values for the last day of exposure. Even so, a rapid AZA accumulation was observed during the first hours of the trial; less than 6 h of feeding were required to reach AZA concentration in mussel above regulatory level. In consistence with physiological observations, AZA concentration of about 200 �g kg− 1 did not increase further {{until the end of the}} study. AZA bioconversion was also found to be a fast process: after 3 h of exposure AZA 17, - 19 and AZA 7 - 10 were already found, with a proportion of AZA 17 equal to AZA 2.

The length-frequency distribution analysis showed a progressively complex population structure with up to three cohorts. The yearly recruitments were observed once a year in spring. The growth curve provided a maximum length higher than that reported for shallow waters. Nevertheless, the gregarious habits of mussels and the reduced water movement caused edaphic modifications of the substratum, which was covered progressively by sediments and biodeposits (<b>pseudofaeces).</b> Consequently, the population structure was affected by a reduction of the newly recruited cohorts, and mussels disappeared after 5 years of colonization.

P. margaritifera occurs in coral reef waters characterised by oligotrophy and low turbidity.

Assays for immune function included total and differential cells counts, phagocytosis and release of extra cellular reactive oxygen species.

40|$|Blue mussels Mytilus edulis (n 14) {{were studied}} in the {{laboratory}} using Hall sensor systems to record their gaping behaviour when exposed to varying food rations and levels of predation risk. Mussel response to increasing daily algal ration was to increase mean gape angle per day and was associated with copious <b>pseudofaeces</b> production at excessive initial algal concentrations, e. g. 250 cells/ml. Mean gape angle decreased (backward S-shaped curve) when fed a fixed algal ration per day where simulated predation risk (introduced fresh mussel homogenate) increased in the water, presumably as an anti-predation strategy. However, this behaviour is presumed to lower feeding rates. There was a general positive relationship between both gape angle {{and the extent of}} valve movement (abduction/ adduction) per event and valve movement speed. However, the fastest valve adduction events, which resulted in valve closure, were recorded independent of gape angle and only when mussels were first exposed to high perceived predation risk. We interpret this as an appropriate response, with high energetic cost, as a first line of defence from predators such as starfish and crabs. Overall, mussel response to predation appears graded and complex, indicating a trade-off between maximizing feeding/pseudofaeces production and minimizing predation risk...|$|E

Rates of oxygen consumption were not significantly affected by changes in seston concentration, whereas clearance rates gradually declined with increasing particle concentration. <b>Pseudofaeces</b> production was initiated at relatively low seston concentrations (< 5 mg l- 1). Marked seasonal changes were recorded {{in the composition of}} suspended particulates (seston) in an estuary in south-west England. Total seston was sampled at frequent intervals throughout an annual cycle and analysed in terms of: particle size-frequency distributions, total dry weight (mg l- 1), inorganic content, chlorophyll a, carbohydrate, protein and lipid. The particulate carbohydrate, protein and lipid content provided an estimate of the food content of the seston. The results are discussed in terms of the “food available” to a nonselective suspension feeder, such as M. edulis, during a seasonal cycle. The effect of inorganic silt in suspension was mainly to limit by “dilution” the amount of food material ingested rather than {{to reduce the amount of}} material filtered by the mussel.

Here we combined stable isotope analysis with quantitative benthic community sampling to investigate temporal variation in the influence of biodeposition of organic material (biodeposits) by the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) on the benthic food web in hard substrate habitats of Lake Constance, Germany. The accumulation of organic material excreted by zebra mussels (faeces and <b>pseudofaeces)</b> is hypothesised to implement a biodeposition based food web.

The proportion of pelagic resources contributing to the diet (by δ 13 C) and trophic position (by δ 15 N) of amphipods were significantly and positively correlated to the production of zebra mussel biodeposits. Also, the benthic community in Lower Lake Constance showed a shift towards higher densities of the mayfly Caenis spp., Chironominae, and the caddisfly Ecnomus tenellus, which might act as links to higher trophic levels when more zebra mussel biodeposits were available. These results demonstrate that temporal variation in zebra mussel density, and thus in organic biodeposition, have a strong impact on the benthic communities and food web structure associated with hard substrates to the extent that there may be dependence on zebra mussel occurrence in such habitats in Lake Constance...|$|E
40|$|Suspension feeders are {{important}} players in coastal food webs: by filtering particles {{suspended in the}} water column and depositing faeces and <b>pseudofaeces</b> in sediments, they mediate the coupling of pelagic primary and benthic secondary production. However, the potential interference of parasite infections on suspension feeding is not well investigated. We experimentally determined the effect of infections with metacercariae of the common trematode Renicola roscovita on clearance rates and condition of blue mussels Mytilus edulis. We also investigated whether there were differences in the effects of infections between different size classes of mussels. Using controlled infections under lab conditions, our experiment showed that infections significantly reduced the clearance rates of mussels. This effect was less pronounced in small (42 % reduction) than in large mussels (71 %). In addition, infections significantly reduced mussel body mass index in large (23 % reduction) and small (17 %) mussels compared to uninfected mussels. These reductions most likely resulted from a combined effect of an interference of the parasites with the mussel’s feeding apparatus (with the palps being the preferred infection site of the parasite) and of the energetic demands of the parasites (with metacercariae growing in size after initial infection). These negative effects on mussel filter feeding capacity indicate that parasites can alter a crucially important functional trait of marine suspension feeders...|$|E

Cockles of 6. 24 ± 0. 04 mm and 66. 14 ± 0. 34 mg (live weight) were distributed into three treatments where live microalgae diets were fed constantly below the <b>pseudofaeces</b> production threshold, for three weeks.

Growth was positively affected by high EPA and low ARA diets, whereas no significant growth was observed {{for the no}} DHA diet. High mortality of cockles fed no DHA diet raises questions about its suitability for cockles. In balanced diets with EPA and DHA, lower concentrations of ARA do not limit growth.

The factors studied included the percentage of water content of the sediment, percentage of total nitrogen, percentage of organic matter along with the total phosphorus and humic acid content. While total phosphorus and humic acid content of the experimental mesocosoms showed gradual and significant increases from 30 d of the experiment to reach the maximum levels after 60 d, the percentage of organic matter registered significant increases right from 15 d onwards and reached the maximum values after 60 d. On the other hand, while the percentage of water content of the sediments of the experimental mesocosoms increased only up to 30 d experiment, percentage of nitrogen was increased {{during the first half}} and at the fag end of the experiment.

The study of interactions between the organism and its environment requires thus a certain level of detail concerning the feeding process, not only from the bivalve point of view - which material can they actually use as food - but also from the ecosystem point of view - to what extent are bivalves able to clear the water column and change ecosystem dynamics? However such detail is commonly neglected in ecosystem modelling and a mechanistic description of the feeding process is still lacking. In this study, the Synthesizing Units concept, part of the Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory, is used to describe the main feeding processes in bivalves. Filtration, ingestion and assimilation are assumed as three different steps and <b>pseudofaeces</b> production computed as the difference between filtered and ingested fluxes. Generic formulations are proposed and discussed, considering several types of food, with type-specific ingestion and assimilation efficiencies. The model performance is evaluated by comparison with the literature data for the blue mussel {{for a wide range of}} experimental conditions. The lack of data and of detailed information on the experimental setups adds some uncertainty to the parameters estimation. Nevertheless, the model results are in good agreement with observations. The model has the desired flexibility to be implemented as an extension to the standard DEB model, to simulate bivalve growth in estuaries and coastal areas where the organisms experience different food quantity and quality. © 2010 Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{aim of this}} study was to establish the biological and environmental parameters governing the successful and sustainable cultivation of mussels in Saldanha Bay. The environmental study investigated seston, chlorophyll-a and particulate organic matter (POM) levels, water temperature dissolved oxygen and salinity levels in the bay and water flow in and around the rafts. The biological part of the study investigated the efficiency of food extraction, growth rates, mussel condition, fouling and production and yield on a rope, raft and farm scale. Saldanha Bay is well suited for the culture of mussels, particularly Mytilus gal/oprovincialis and Choromytilus meridionalis. Water temperature and salinity in Saldanha Bay were found to be near optimal for mussel culture. POM and chlorophyll-a levels were found to be high due to primary production resulting from the nutrient rich upwelled water outside Saldanha Bay. The mean levels of chlorophyll-a (8, 6,ug/l) represent 6 %, by mass, of the total POM. On a bay scale the POM remained above the mussels maximum requirements (<b>pseudofaeces</b> threshold) during the study period. Mussels showed a preference for the phytoplankton portion of the POM. Approximately 40 % of the chlorophyll-a was extracted from the water by the mussel farm. The efficiency of food extraction increased with mussel age. Rafts with seed mussels younger than 2 months, 3 to 4 months, 5 to 6 months and older than 6 months extracted 32 %, 55 %, 85 % and 92 % of the available chlorophyll-a respectively. An increase of rope spacing on the rafts resulted in 37 % more chlorophyll-a and 30 % more particle volume reaching the lee of the raft. Ambient water currents in the bay show flow rates of up to 22 cm per second. However, on entering a raft with a rope spacing of 60 cm, the water flow is attenuated by 90 %. Increasing the rope spacing to 90 em resulted in a water flow attenuation of 72 %. The increase in rope spacing ensures that the mussels in the centre of the raft are feeding on food levels close to, or above, the <b>pseudofaeces</b> level. Mussel growth rate at a rope spacing of 90 cm is significantly improved as a result of the increased food delivery. There are other factors, however that effect mussel growth. Growth rates were found to be better in summer than in winter. The reduced winter growth rate is possibly due to competition with the maturing fouling organisms which settle in mid to late summer. Fouling by mussel spat and Ciona intestinalis is seasonal, occurring from December to May. C. intestinalis is prevalent in the centre of the farm and rafts as low energy waters are preferred by this species. Mussel spat settles mainly on the periphery of the farm and the rafts. Competition with fouling organisms reduces growth and increases mortality of the cultured mussels. Results indicate that the present spacing of rafts, (1 raft per hectare) is adequate under existing conditions. Any new farms should maintain batches of 50 rafts with channels between them to ensure water current penetration into the furthest reaches of the farm. Rope spacing on the rafts should be increased to between 60 cm and 90 cm. Mussel density should be regulated according to mussel size and fouling should be controlled to mai'ltain yields.) ...|$|E
40|$|Santa Catarina is the {{greatest}} oyster and mussel producer in Brazil. The main cultivated species are the exotic oyster Crassostrea gigas, the native Crassostrea rhizophorae and the mussel Perna perna. Most of the production is concentrated {{in the capital city}} Florianópolis. This work aimed to assess possible alterations in the organic chemical composition of marine sediments caused by the intense cultures. For this purpose 17 sedimentary samples have been collected inside and outside of two oyster and mussel farms in the south bay region of Florianópolis. Values of atomic C/N ratio varied between 4. 5 and 6. 3, whereas H/C ratio averaged 0. 8, indicating predominance of planktonic derived organic matter. Concentration of total phosphorus for all samples from both farms varied from 73 to 355 g g- 1 of dry weight sediment. Below the producing areas the concentration of organic phosphorus (OP) was higher than the inorganic phosphorus (IP). Aliphatic hydrocarbons, extending from n-C 11 to n-C 40, were found in all samples of both regions. Sterols of planktonic and terrigenous sources were also found in all samples, with total concentrations extending from 3 to 22 g g- 1. With the exception of cholesterol, no significant difference between concentration of sterols found in the samples below and outside of the culture areas could be associated with oyster production. The composition of monocarboxylic saturated and unsaturated acids were similar for both farms. The biodetritus, faeces and <b>pseudofaeces</b> organic extract of Crassostrea gigas oyster showed no sterols or monocarboxylic acids distinct from those identified in the sedimentary samples. In terms of chemical composition the increase in OP and cholesterol values in the sediments seem {{to be related to the}} cultures...|$|E
40|$|A dynamic growth {{model is}} {{presented}} for the suspension-feeding scallop Chlamys farreri. The model is configured and validated for C. farreri cultured in Sungo Bay, China, using functional relations to simulate rapid and sensitive adjustments in feeding and metabolism as observed {{in response to}} the highly changeable environment there. Notable novel elements include resolving significant adjustments in the relative processing of living chlorophyll-rich phytoplankton organics, nonphytoplankton organics and the remaining inorganic matter during both differential retention on the gill and selective pre-ingestive rejection within <b>pseudofaeces.</b> We also include a facility to predict the energy content of non-phytoplankton organics. This is significant, for living phytoplankton contributed less than 20 % towards suspended particulate organic matter within Sungo Bay. Further, the energy content of non-phytoplankton organics was very much more variable than for phytoplankton organics. Whether using that facility or assuming an average value for the energy content of non-phytoplankton organics, resolution of the relative processing of different particle types allows simulation of how the rates, organic compositions and energy contents of filtered, ingested and deposited matter change in response to differences in seawater temperature, seston availability and seston composition. Dependent relations predict rates of energy absorption, energy expenditure and excretion. By these means, our model replicates dynamic adjustments in feeding and metabolism across full ranges of relevant natural variability, and successfully simulates scallop growth from larvae or seed to harvestable size under different temporal and spatial scenarios of culture. This is an important advance compared with simpler models that do simulate responsive adjustments. Only by modelling the complex set of feedbacks, both positive and negative, whereby suspension feeding shellfish interact with ecosystem processes, can one realistically hope to assess environmental capacities for culture...|$|E
40|$|Colony forming {{and toxic}} {{cyanobacteria}} form {{a problem in}} surface waters of shallow lakes, both for recreation and wildlife. Zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha, have been employed to help to restore shallow lakes in the Netherlands, dominated by cyanobacteria, to their former clear state. Zebra mussels have been present in these lakes since they were created in the 19 th century by the excavation of peat and are usually {{not considered to be}} an invasive species. Most grazing experiments using Dreissena have been performed with uni-cellular phytoplankton laboratory strains and information on grazing of larger phytoplankton taxa hardly exists. To gain more insight in to whether D. polymorpha is indeed able to decrease cyanobacteria in the phytoplankton, we therefore performed grazing experiments with zebra mussels and two species of cyanobacteria, that greatly differ in shape: colony forming strains of Microcystis aeruginosa and the filamentous species Planktothrix agardhii. For both species a toxic and a non-toxic strain was selected. We found that zebra mussels cleared toxic Planktothrix at a higher rate than non-toxic Planktothrix, toxic or non-toxic Microcystis. Clearance rates between the other strains were not significantly different. Both phytoplankton species, regardless of toxicity, size and shape, were found in equal amounts (based on chlorophyll concentrations) in the excreted products of the mussels (<b>pseudofaeces).</b> The results show that zebra mussels are capable of removing colonial and filamentous cyanobacteria from the water, regardless of whether the cyanobacteria are toxic or not. This implies that the mussels may be used as a biofilter for the removal of harmful cyanobacterial blooms in shallow (Dutch) lakes where the mussels are already present and not a nuisance. Providing more suitable substrate for zebra mussel attachment may lead to appropriate mussel densities capable of filtering large quantities of cyanobacteria. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{sources of}} carbon and the dietary habits of Brachidontes pharaonis (Mollusca, Bivalvia), a new Lessepsian {{entry in the}} western Mediterranean, living in a cooling vat of a saltworks system in western Sicily (MED), were {{assessed}} by estimating throughout a season the relative abundance of a stable carbon isotope (δ 13 C) in particulate organic matter (POM), sedimentary organic matter (SOM), primary organic matter sources (seagrasses, sand microflora, macroalgae), Brachidontes pharaonis and its biodeposition material. In the saltworks the most enriched primary food source potentially fuelling the saltworks food web was Cymodocea nodosa (seasonal average - 7. 9 ± 0. 6 ‰), Laurencia papillosa and Cystoseira sp., which represented the predominant macroalgae (seasonal average - 19. 0 ± 1. 0 ‰) and sand microflora δ 13 C (- 14. 7 ± 0. 11 ‰). POM annual mean δ 13 C was - 17. 4 ± 0. 9 ‰, and that of SOM was - 17. 0 ± 2. 3 ‰. The seasonal mean isotopic value of B. pharaonis was - 14. 7 ± 0. 7 ‰; while its faeces was more depleted (- 17. 7 ± 2. 4 ‰), while the <b>pseudofaeces</b> (- 14. 6 ± 3. 6 ‰) was similar to somatic B. pharaonis in composition. Our study showed that Brachidontes assimilated mostly mixed sedimentary organic carbon re-arranged via a detritus route dominated mainly by macroalgae and sand microflora {{and that it was}} able to exploit almost all the predominant carbon sources available in its colonised environment both directly (sand microflora) and indirectly via the POM/SOM detritus route. These carbon sources incorporated most of the environmental variability relative to the isotopic composition of primary producers (about - 11 ‰ throughout the year) ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{determined}} the potential roles of food concentration {{and distribution of}} energy between body components in the greater growth rates of triploid Sydney rock oysters (Saccostrea commercialis) compared to diploids. Laboratory studies were conducted using rehydrated microalgae, Spongiococcum excentricum, up to 20 mg l⁻¹, to assess food concentration effects on the feeding and physiological energetics of juvenile and adult diploid and triploid S. commercialis. The parameters clearance rate (CR), absorption efficiency (abs. eff.), <b>pseudofaeces</b> production (PF), respiration (R) and ammonia excretion (E) were measured to determine the energy available for growth and reproduction, defined as scope for growth (SFG). The cost of respiration and excretion was significantly higher for adult diploid oysters {{across a range of}} food concentrations (3 to 20 mg l⁻¹). Juvenile diploids also used more energy in excretion across this range of food concentration. These differences in energy expenditures contribute to marginal differences in scope for growth (SFG). Triploid S. commercialis have higher SFG than their diploid siblings at low food; however, they have less ability to handle higher food concentrations than diploid oysters. Because of this inability of triploids to outperform their diploids at high food concentrations, feeding and physiological energetics probably play only minor roles in the observed differences in growth of diploid and triploid S. commercialis. Analyses of the energy content of soft and shell tissues in adult oysters revealed major differences between the ploidy conditions. Triploid oysters have total energy content that is much higher than diploids of the same shell length, and their soft tissue content is relatively higher. In adult triploids, either or both of two things are occurring to enhance their growth advantages over diploids: (1) the proportion of energy devoted to soft tissue production (flesh and reproductive tissue) is greater or (2) the stunted reproductive cycle of triploids helps them maintain energy levels stored in the soft tissue, whereas diploids expend and must replenish these levels following a reproductive episode...|$|E
40|$|The feeding {{behavior}} of Brachidontes pharaonis (Mollusca, Bivalvia), a new Lessepsian {{entry in the}} western Mediterranean, living in a cooling vat of a saltworks system in western Sicily, was assessed by estimating its physiological rates throughout a 6 month-long study (May 1998 to March 1999). Clearance, filtration, ingestion, and food absorption rates were estimated using the biodeposition method and the results correlated to variations in temperature, salinity, and {{quality and quantity of}} available food. Measured seston concentrations were on average 81. 5 ± 95. 5 mg L- 1, its labile fraction (estimated as the sum of particulate lipids, carbohydrates and proteins) was on average 0. 55 ± 0. 07 μg L- 1, representing only 15 % of the total organics. Phytoplankton biomass, as suspended chlorophyll-a, was on average 0. 88 ± 0. 4 μg L- 1. Mean weight standardised rates of Brachidontes pharaonis were clearance rate 1. 64 ± 0. 82 l h- 1, filtration rate 110 ± 107 mg h- 1 of total suspended material, and egestion rate 0. 60 ± 0. 16 mg material h- 1. There was a mean selection efficiency of 0. 50 ± 0. 22. Ingested organic matter varied between about 2 mg h- 1 and 270 mg h- 1, and food absorption efficiency ranged between 0. 1 and 0. 99. The Brachidontes feeding process seems to be regulated at the initial filtration stage, and most of the control determines the quantity of absorbed ration. Clearance rate is maintained independent of changes in water temperature and salinity but reflects fluctuations in {{the quantity and quality of}} available food. Varying the rate of <b>pseudofaeces</b> production regulated ingestion rate, although this mechanism be fairly inefficient as a response to local environmental conditions. Absorption efficiencies may be sensitive to the balance of biochemical components. The physiological plasticity of B. pharaonis as expressed in this study is believed to have played a major role in its ability to reach the western Mediterranean...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of the short-necked clam Tapes philippinarum into the Sacca di Goro has over a short period made this coastal environment {{one of the top}} European clam production sites. In recent years, this activity has been seriously impacted due to the appearance in the lagoon of large macroalgal beds and the occurrence of dystrophic events causing anoxia and massive deaths of molluscs in the cultivated areas. Tapes cultivation sites now cover more than one third of the lagoon surface at densities sometimes attaining 2000 – 2500 adult individuals m− 2; such densities and the harvesting methods, based on sediment dredging, probably have a strong impact on the benthic system. Whilst {{a number of studies have}} reportedwater–sediment interface induced modifications due to oyster or mussel farming there have been few attempts to quantify how clam farming affects biogeochemical cycles of oxygen and nutrients, in particular in the Sacca di Goro. Two areas, a farmed and a control one, were compared for benthic fluxes and results were correlated with clam biomass. Oxygen, carbon dioxide, ammonium, reactive silica and phosphorus fluxes were stimulated several fold by the presence of Tapes due to the clams, respiration and excretion activities, but also to the reducing conditions in the surface sediments. On average, the whole lagoon dark sediment O 2 demand and CO 2 production were stimulated by a factor of, respectively, 1. 8 and 3. 3, whilst nutrient release was 6. 5 times higher for NH 4 + and 4. 6 times higher for PO 4 3 −. Our results indicate that clam farmers should carefully consider sustainable densities of Tapes in order to prevent the risk of sediment and water anoxia.
