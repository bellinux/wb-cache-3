5|$|In {{a dispute}} {{illustrating}} {{the nature of}} claims, defenses, and counterclaims for patent infringement based on arguments of <b>prior</b> <b>art</b> and first to file, rival digital music player maker Creative Technology sued Apple in May 2006 for Apple's alleged infringement of Creative's Zen patent claiming Apple infringed Creative's patent for the menuing structures on an MP3 player. Creative claimed it began using its menuing method on its Nomad players in September 2000, approximately a year prior to Apple's first iPod release in October 2001. Creative, a Singapore-based consumer electronics group, also filed a trade complaint with the United States International Trade Commission (ITC) against Apple. Creative asked for a court injunction to block the import and sale of Apple's iPod and iPod nano in the United States and for money damages for past sales. Apple filed a countersuit against Creative on similar grounds.|$|E
5|$|In June 2008, Apple {{was named}} among others as a {{defendant}} in a suit brought by plaintiff Typhoon Touch Technologies in the federal U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging patent infringement in portable touch screen technology. The suit illustrated the vagaries of litigating patent licensing and royalty collection issues in the commercial exploitation of intellectual property rights. Ultimately, Typhoon could not prevail against patent defense arguments of <b>prior</b> <b>art</b> and obviousness and earned itself {{a reputation as a}} patent troll. Typhoon acquired two pre-existing patents, (filed in 1993 and 1994 and issued in 1995 and 1997), in mid-2007 for $350,000 plus a percentage of collected licensing fees. The patents had languished for some time and were not being policed; shortly after Typhoon acquired the patents, it began enforcement by bringing suit against exploiters of the technology who had not paid licensing fees. Typhoon was successful in its patent infringement suits against some small companies, and then expanded its litigation to go after larger ones. Typhoon alleged that Apple and others used its patented technology inventions without permission. Typhoon originally filed the suit in December 2007 against Dell after settling with some smaller companies but, in mid-2008, amended its complaint to add Apple, Fujitsu, Toshiba, Lenovo, Panasonic, HTC, Palm, Samsung, Nokia, and LG. In 2010, Apple settled with Typhoon for an undisclosed sum and was then dismissed from the litigation as of September 2010. The other large companies were able to rebuff Typhoon's claims, and Typhoon ceased doing business in 2008 after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) suspended its trading in a fraud investigation.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a novel {{steganalysis}} method {{based on}} {{statistical analysis of}} empirical matrix (EM) is proposed to detect the presence of hidden message in an image. The projection histogram （PH ） of EM is used to extract features composed of two parts: the moments of PH and the moments of the characteristic function of PH. Also, features extracted from prediction-error image [7] are included to enhance performance. SVM is utilized as classifier. A test database is constructed, based on which a detailed test for different categories of features and a comparison with methods in <b>prior</b> <b>arts</b> are conducted. Experiments show that the features we proposed are more effective than <b>prior</b> <b>arts</b> and our steganalysis method could blindly detect the presence of data hiding for various embedding schemes with high performance...|$|R

25|$|The JPEG {{committee}} {{investigated the}} patent claims in 2002 and {{were of the}} opinion that they were invalidated by <b>prior</b> <b>art.</b> Others also concluded that Forgent did not have a patent that covered JPEG. Nevertheless, between 2002 and 2004 Forgent was able to obtain about US$105 million by licensing their patent to some 30 companies. In April 2004, Forgent sued 31 other companies to enforce further license payments. In July of the same year, a consortium of 21 large computer companies filed a countersuit, with the goal of invalidating the patent. In addition, Microsoft launched a separate lawsuit against Forgent in April 2005. In February 2006, the United States Patent and Trademark Office agreed to re-examine Forgent's JPEG patent {{at the request of the}} Public Patent Foundation. On May 26, 2006 the USPTO found the patent invalid based on <b>prior</b> <b>art.</b> The USPTO also found that Forgent knew about the <b>prior</b> <b>art,</b> and did not tell the Patent Office, making any appeal to reinstate the patent highly unlikely to succeed.|$|E

25|$|The <b>prior</b> <b>art</b> {{qualification}} for the Live Traffic paper {{centered on}} the public accessibility of a document available on a FTP server. SRI argued that the FTP site was not publicly accessible because one would need the complete FTP address to view the paper. Additionally, the posting was not indexed and could only be found by an ordinary skilled user through “dumb luck”. Symantec and SSI countered that on multiple occasions SRI had provided links to the FTP site to multiple members of the intrusion detection community. Furthermore, SRI’s FTP site had been referenced by Google Groups and was widely regarded as a repository of information for computer security. Robinson’s examination of the case evidence noted that no {{attempts were made to}} limit access via password security. Robinson deemed the Live Traffic paper publicly accessible as established by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in the precedent cases In re Bayer, In re Hall, In re Cronyn, and In re Klopfenstein.

40|$|International audienceObjective We {{aimed at}} {{summarising}} rates and {{factors associated with}} retention in HIV care prior to antiretroviral treatment (ART) eligibility in sub-Saharan Africa. Design We conducted a systematic literature review (2002 – 2014). We searched Medline/Pubmed, Scopus and Web of Science, as well as proceedings of conferences. We included all original research studies published in peer-reviewed journals, which used quantitative indicators of retention in care <b>prior</b> to <b>ART</b> eligibility. Participants People not yet eligible for ART. Primary and secondary outcomes Rate of retention in HIV care <b>prior</b> to <b>ART</b> eligibility and associated factors. Results 10 papers and 2 abstracts were included. Most studies were conducted in Southern and Eastern Africa between 2004 and 2011 and reported retention rates in pre-ART care {{up to the second}} CD 4 measurement. Definition of retention in HIV care <b>prior</b> to <b>ART</b> eligibility differed substantially across studies. Retention rates ranged between 23 % and 88 % based on series ranging from 112 to 10   314 individuals; retention was higher in women, individuals aged > 25  years, those with low CD 4 count, high body mass index or co-infected with tuberculosis, and in settings with free cotrimoxazole use. Conclusions Retention in HIV care <b>prior</b> to <b>ART</b> eligibility in sub-Saharan Africa has been insufficiently described so far leaving major research gaps, especially regarding long-term retention rates and sociodemographic, economic, clinical and programmatic logistic determinants.

30|$|It {{is noted}} that the <b>prior</b> <b>arts</b> were {{developed}} with the concept to approach the optimal fuel efficiency by controlling the IC engine {{to run in the}} RPM range around the maximum power since the range is close to the congregation of the minimum fuel consumption. Such a concept may not always work because of the following reasons:The torque decreases with the increase of speed after the maximum torque is reached. Since the output power is the product of the two, the maximum power may almost keep unchanged in a large speed range of RPM. This means that there are many RPMs of maximum power; therefore, it is difficult to use the above-mentioned concept to approach the optimal fuel consumption.From the study of the working properties of IC engines, it is found that there are basically two different IC engine working profiles (Discussed in the next section). The first profile appears a congregation of the minimum fuel consumption RPM close to the maximum output torque RPM. The second profile appears no congregation of the minimum fuel consumption RPM near the maximum output torque RPM, and the fuel consumption rate simply rises with the increase of RPM. It means that the said concept of <b>prior</b> <b>arts</b> can only work with the first profile.|$|R
