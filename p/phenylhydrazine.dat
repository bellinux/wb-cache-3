5|$|The Fischer indole {{synthesis}} is {{a chemical}} reaction {{that produces the}} aromatic heterocycle indole from a (substituted) <b>phenylhydrazine</b> and an aldehyde or ketone under acidic conditions. The reaction was discovered in 1883 by Hermann Emil Fischer.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the oldest}} and most {{reliable}} methods for synthesizing substituted indoles is the Fischer indole synthesis, developed in 1883 by Emil Fischer. Although the synthesis of indole itself is problematic using the Fischer indole synthesis, it is often used to generate indoles substituted in the 2- and/or 3-positions. Indole can still be synthesized, however, using the Fischer indole synthesis by reacting <b>phenylhydrazine</b> with pyruvic acid followed by decarboxylation of the formed indole-2-carboxylic acid. This has also been accomplished in a one-pot synthesis using microwave irradiation.|$|E
25|$|Loss of sialic acid {{has been}} {{identified}} in papers when DHB {{has been used as}} a matrix for MALDI MS analysis of glycosylated peptides. Using sinapinic acid, 4-HCCA and DHB as matrices, S. Martin studied loss of sialic acid in glycosylated peptides by metastable decay in MALDI/TOF in linear mode and reflector mode. A group at Shimadzu Corporation derivatized the sialic acid by an amidation reaction as a way to improve detection sensitivity and also demonstrated that ionic liquid matrix reduces a loss of sialic acid during MALDI/TOF MS analysis of sialylated oligosaccharides. THAP, DHAP, and a mixture of 2-aza-2-thiothymine and <b>phenylhydrazine</b> have been identified as matrices that could be used to minimize loss of sialic acid during MALDI MS analysis of glycosylated peptides.|$|E

5000|$|The {{reaction}} {{can be used}} {{to identify}} monosaccharides. It involves two reactions. Firstly glucose with <b>phenylhydrazine</b> gives glucosephenylhydrazone by elimination of a water molecule from the functional group. The next step involves reaction of one equivalent of glucosephenylhydrazone with two equivalents of <b>phenylhydrazine</b> (excess). First <b>phenylhydrazine</b> is involved in oxidizing the alpha carbon to a carbonyl group, and the second <b>phenylhydrazine</b> involves in removal of one water molecule with the new-formed carbonyl group of that oxidized carbon and forming the similar carbon nitrogen bond.

40|$|The ^(15) N {{resonances}} of the methylhydrazines {{and some}} <b>phenylhydrazines</b> have been determined at the natural-abundance level of ^(15) N. The chemical shifts for the methyl compounds were interpretable {{in terms of}} deshielding α and β effects. The β shift, - 24. 4 ppm, is substantially larger than that found for amine ^(15) N (- 18. 2 ppm) or hydrocarbon nmr resonances (- 9. 7 ppm), and an explanation is offered in terms of possible steric influences. Although the ^(15) N shifts of the <b>phenylhydrazines</b> also change with structure, the data are so far insufficient to allow derivation of substituent parameters. Nonetheless, the effects of substitution appear to be less systematic than for the alkylhydrazines. The nmr chemical shifts of the methylhydrazines have been measured. While the shifts do not correlate with the ^(15) N shifts, they can be {{expressed in terms of}} deshielding β and shielding γ effects comparable to those found for hydrocarbons and alcohols...|$|R

40|$|Parallel {{with the}} advancements in medical {{techniques}} and treatments, the microorganisms that we are constantly battling against are also evolving. Bacterial evolution is leading to {{an increasing number of}} antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria. As the bacteria evolve, the antibiotics that are currently in use to combat bacterial diseases are becoming ineffective. FDA approval of new antibacterial agents decreased drastically over the past decade. Thus the design and synthesis of new classes of antibacterial agents, possibly with structures unrelated to the current antibiotics, as the next generation antibacterial agents is highly desirable. In the current work the antimicrobial effect of an extended library of about 80 diarylhydrazones, related diaryl Schiff-bases and their precursor compounds, aryl-carbonyl compounds and <b>phenylhydrazines</b> have been evaluated against Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus aureus strains of bacteria. All compounds have been properly purified by recrystallization or column chromatography. The products were characterized by mass spectrometry and 1 H, 13 C and, when applicable, 19 F NMR spectroscopy. While the diarylhydrazones and diaryl Schiff-bases were chosen due to their general biological activity, the carbonyl compounds and <b>phenylhydrazines,</b> that are their precursor compounds, were screened as possible metabolic products. Independent hydrolysis and mass spectrometric studies were also carried out under the generic assay conditions {{in order to determine the}} stability of the screened diarylhydrazones and Schiff-bases. The compounds have been tested in standard cytotoxicity assays using Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus aureus strains. It was observed that the diarylhydrazones showed considerable activity against all three bacterial strains, while the diaryl Schiff-bases exhibited moderate to weak activity. The precursor compounds appeared to be inactive against the bacteria.

40|$|A {{new class}} of {{multifunctional}} small molecule inhibitors of amyloid self-assembly is described. Several compounds, based on the diarylhydrazone scaffold were designed. Forty-four substituted derivatives of this core structure were synthesized {{using a variety of}} benzaldehydes and <b>phenylhydrazines</b> and were characterized. The inhibitor candidates were evaluated in multiple assays, including the inhibition of A fibrillogenesis and the disassembly of preformed fibrils. The hydrazone scaffold showed strong activity in inhibiting the amyloid beta self-assembly. The structure-activity relationship revealed that the substituents on the aromatic rings had considerable effect on the overall activity of the compounds. In order to identify possible functional moieties responsible for the strong effect further related compounds (Schiff-bases and their hydrogenated product, secondary amines) were synthesized and tested in the inhibition of fibril formation by Thioflavin-T Fluorescence spectroscopy and the fibril morphology was followed by Atomic Force Microscopy.

Investigation of the mechanism of action indicated the induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) as the molecular event responsible for the inhibition of cell growth. This phenomenon is related to the ability of the test compounds to cause a rapid Ca 2 +-dependent and cyclosporin A-sensitive collapse of the transmembrane potential (DW) and matrix swelling.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the effect of size of a single neutral ring substituent on the induction of hemolytic anemia {{and the formation of}} a ferrihemochrome by substituted <b>phenylhydrazines.</b> The severity of induced anemia decreased with increase in size of a halogen atom or an alkyl group ortho to the hydrazino group, little anemia resulting from 2 -iodophenylhydrazine and no anemia from 2 -tert-butylphenylhydrazine. The size of a halogen atom or an alkyl group at the meta or para position had relatively little effect on the severity of induced anemia. The ability of an arylhydrazine to induce hemolytic anemia paralleled its ability to produce a ferrihemochrome with an exogenous ligand, probably the corresponding aryldiazene. In general, rapid and complete formation of ferrihemochrome occurred with arylhydrazines that induced severe anemia. The degree of hemolysis induced by an arylhydrazine was not related to its rate of autooxidation, i. e., the rate at which oxidants are formed by the reduction of oxygen. We propose a mechanism of arylhydrazine-induced oxidative denaturation based on the simultaneous formation of hydroxyl radical and aryldiazene ferrihemochrome in a reaction of oxyhemoglobin with arylhydrazine. We suggest that after oxidation of the porphyrin ring is initiated by a hydroxyl radical, oxidative cleavage of the ring is facilitated by the presence of a large ligand in the heme crevice. Thus, aryldiazene ferrihemochrome may contribute to instability in a hemoglobin molecule, whereas globin ferrihemochrome results from instability...|$|R
