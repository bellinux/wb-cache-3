50|$|A zero-intelligence trader (ZI) is {{a simple}} {{algorithmic}} trader in a market based on the dumb agent theory who proposes to <b>purchase</b> (<b>bid)</b> or to sell (ask) randomly, subject only to minimal constraints. Constraints might be resource or bankruptcy constraints imposed externally {{by the rules of}} the market. Ownership of sufficient resources to buy the items the trader bids for, or ownership of resources the trader offers for sale are examples of such market-imposed constraints. Alternatively, the constraints may be internal to the trader. Not bidding more than the value of the resource to the trader, and not asking less than the cost of the resource to the trader are examples of such internal constraints. Under either interpretation, ZI traders use minimal intelligence in choosing their actions in markets.|$|E
5000|$|The Outlet Company {{reached a}} {{long-term}} affiliation agreement with NBC that renewed the network's contracts with Outlet's two existing NBC affiliates, WJAR-TV (channel 10) in Providence and WCMH-TV (channel 4) in Columbus, Ohio. As {{part of the}} deal, Outlet also agreed to switch WNCN (channel 17) in Goldsboro, North Carolina - which the group purchased from Group H Broadcasting for $5.4 million in May 1994 - to NBC. WNCN had been a charter affiliate of The WB for nine {{months prior to the}} switch, but also carried select NBC programs that had been pre-empted by the network's existing Raleigh-Durham affiliate, WRDC (channel 28, now a MyNetworkTV affiliate), which had been one of NBC's lowest-rated affiliates throughout its tenure with the network. When WNCN joined NBC on September 3, 1995 (one month earlier than its originally announced date of October 1), WRDC affiliated with UPN, while the WB affiliation moved to upstart WRAZ (channel 50, now a Fox affiliate) when that station signed on four days later on September 7. Outlet sold its broadcasting holdings to NBC's owned-and-operated station group, NBC Television Stations, for $396 million in August 1995 (beating out an initial <b>purchase</b> <b>bid</b> by Renaissance Broadcasting), resulting in WNCN becoming that network's first owned-and-operated station on the UHF band since 1959, when it sold WNBC (channel 30) in New Britain, Connecticut to Plains Television in June of that year (NBC would repurchase that station, by then known as WVIT, in July 1997 from the Paramount Stations Group). On February 29, 2016, through an affiliation agreement with Media General (which acquired WNCN as part of its purchase of four NBC O&Os located in mid-sized markets in 2006), WNCN switched to CBS, trading network affiliations with WRAL-TV (channel 5) {{as a result of a}} disagreement during contract renewal negotiations between WRAL owner Capitol Broadcasting Company and CBS over terms of increasing the share of retransmission revenue that the station would pay the latter (the deal reunited NBC with WRAL, which had previously served as its original Raleigh-Durham affiliate from 1956 to 1968).|$|E
40|$|Economic cycles have {{a strong}} impact on the {{profitability}} and operations of modern markets. Even commercial real estate investments which have been traditionally considered to produce steady returns with a relatively low volatility have encountered large difficulties especially {{during the last decade}} to generate returns which succeed their return expectations. Simultaneously the rapid development of the Finnish commercial real estate investment market has woken up the interest of even increasing amount of investors which has further increased the competition between different investors actively participating in the market notably. A proportion of the investors have managed to perform better than their competitors during different phases of the economic cycle by creating and utilizing so called competitive advantages in relation to their competitors. This master’s thesis focuses on studying the competitive advantages in relation to fluctuations of the economic cycle of different domestic and foreign investors which have been active in the Finnish commercial real estate market between the years 2006 and 2012. This thesis includes a literature review of competitive advantages in general and furthermore applies these theories to commercial real estate investment. Competitive advantages of different investors are observed in relation to the organizations’ internal characteristics and cost efficiencies considering the discounted cash flow analysis which is typically used for valuating various real estate investments. The research’s empirical part studies the transactions data of the years 2006, 2009 and 2012 resembling different phases of the economic cycle. Furthermore it recognizes and analyses the investment strategies of different investors in relation to the transactions data {{in order to determine the}} actual competiveness of investors with different organization types during the observation years. The assumption behind this research is that in order to successfully purchase assets the investor is required to have relative competitive advantages compared to other investors participating in the purchase process in order to be able to place the asset's highest <b>purchase</b> <b>bid.</b> According to research results the competiveness of investors with different organization types indeed varies depending on the current dominant phase of the economic cycle. Despite this the results show that domestic publicly listed commercial real estate investors are extremely competitive during all the observation years with a significant difference to other organization types. Furthermore the theory discussed in this thesis supports the fact that publicly listed commercial real estate investment companies possess good conditions to perform very competitively in the markets...|$|E

40|$|Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator, Inc. (MISO) is a {{non-profit}} regional transmission organization (RTO) that oversees electricity production and transmission across thirteen states and one Canadian province. MISO also operates an electronic exchange for {{buying and selling}} electricity for each of its five regional hubs. MISO oversees two types of markets. The forward market, which {{is referred to as}} the day-ahead (DA) market, allows market participants to place demand bids and supply offers on electricity to be delivered at a specified hour the following day. The equilibrium price, known as the locational marginal price (LMP), is determined by MISO after receiving sale offers and <b>purchase</b> <b>bids</b> from market participants. MISO also coordinates a spot market, which is known as the real-time (RT) market. Traders in the real-time market must submit bids and offers by thirty minutes prior to the hour for which the trade will be executed. After receiving purchase and sale offers for a given hour in the real time market, MISO then determines the LMP for that particular hour. The existence of the DA and RT markets allows producers and retailers to hedge against the large fluctuations that are common in electricity prices. Hedge ratios on the MISO exchange are estimated using various techniques. No hedge ratio technique examined consistently outperforms the unhedged portfolio in terms of variance reduction. Consequently, none of the hedge ratio methods in this study meet the general interpretation of FASB guidelines for a highly effective hedge. One of the major goals of deregulation is to bring about competition and increased efficiency in electricity markets. Previous research suggests that electricity exchanges may not be weak-form market efficient. A simple moving average trading rule is found to produce statistically and economically significant profits on the MISO exchange. This could call the long-term survivability of the MISO exchange into question...|$|R
40|$|We {{partition}} takeover bids {{into two}} groups: {{those that are}} deferred from the date of a toehold purchase, {{and those that are}} coincident with a toehold <b>purchase.</b> Coincident <b>bids</b> alone have approximately zero abnormal returns at bid/toehold, but deferred bids have negative abnormals both in the pre-bid interval (representing bid anticipation) and at announcement. Negative returns are puzzling because of the implication that intending bidders should never defer. We classify deferred bids into those that should optimally have been deferred, and those that should not by devising a risk-neutral valuation procedure to measure the value of the option to defer. The negative returns are traced to a sub-group of deferred bids that should optimally have been coincident. We conjecture why non-optimally deferring bidders should behave in this way. 2 1...|$|R

30|$|In a {{competitive}} market {{for the provision of}} goods and services, there will be many different suppliers, each of whom may choose to offer a product with a particular combination of price and quality attributes. Financial risk management is often a high priority for participants in deregulated electricity markets due to the substantial price and volume risks that the markets can exhibit. A consequence of the complexity of a wholesale electricity market can be extremely high price volatility at times of peak demand and supply shortages. Consumers will choose the combination of price and quality that best meets their individual preferences. Suppliers will compete to improve their market share by striving to offer better quality products for the lowest price. In economic terms, electricity (both power and energy) is a commodity capable of being bought, sold, and traded.
