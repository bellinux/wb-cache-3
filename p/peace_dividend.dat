40|$|Lack {{of local}} {{ownership}} {{is seen as}} a central explanation for why peacebuilding efforts often fail to yield sustainable <b>peace</b> <b>dividends.</b> But how is local ownership understood and acted upon by those who are engaged in peacebuilding efforts at the country level? Based on research in four countries – Afghanistan, Haiti, Liberia and Sudan – this study finds that the way ownership is operationalized by external actors at the country level is quite different from how it is defined in policy documents. The most prevalent operationalization is ownership as a conditional right with external actors seeing ownership as theirs to give to local actors when certain conditions (such as capacity or responsibility) are met. The result is often that reform efforts are unsustainable. This report suggests some concrete steps that can be taken to render ownership an operational principle...|$|R

Moreover, violent conflict itself is a major driver of acute food insecurity.

The situation changed when the country failed to utilize <b>peace</b> <b>dividends</b> and the economy suffered a serious breakdown. The Russian political elite expressed concerns that this policy was the Euro-Atlantic community's attempt to underscore the dimension of Russian humiliation and to further limit Russian influence in the international arena. Russia adamantly opposed NATO advancement to the territory of the former USSR; by exploiting this hard stance Moscow, indeed, provided NATO aspirants with arguments to join the Alliance. There is a tendency in Russia to view its relationship with NATO through the prism of the U. S. dominant role in the Alliance.

40|$|Overview: Since {{the signing}} of the 1993 Oslo Declaration of Principles, the donor {{community}} has invested more than 23 billion into “peace and development” in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT), {{making it one of the}} highest per capita recipients of non-military aid in the world.

Al-Shabaka Guest Author Jeremy Wildeman and Program Director Alaa Tartir examine the origins of the present aid-for-peace model as well as its effects on socio-economic conditions and pull together the many critiques of the Oslo economic model. The authors argue that donors are reinforcing failed past patterns associated with the so-called <b>peace</b> <b>dividends</b> model while making only cosmetic changes to their engagement. Indeed, donors do not appear ready to change an approach dominated by policy “instrumentalists” who ignore and reject outcomes that do not match their pre-determined values instead of upholding international law on Palestinian rights and international development principles that strive to “do no harm. ” They underscore the alarming possibility that the Oslo aid model may serve too many interests to be dismantled and conclude with an assessment of what will be needed for change...|$|R
40|$|Lebanon’s {{civil war}} ended in 1990 with the Taëf Accord that {{rebalanced}} power between religious communities, taking some {{away from the}} Maronites {{to the benefit of}} the Sunnis and Shias. However, the Syria conflict that broke in 2011 demonstrated that a number of Lebanese Sunnis were susceptible to radicalization as some perpetrated suicide-attacks and many involved in violent actions: peace has not ultimately taken root in the minds of many. This paper ambitions to understand why. Three routes will be explored. The first relates to the interplay of regional and domestic dynamics: how do regional conflicts feed into internal politics? The second focuses on factors that help explain why people are susceptible to radicalization in a context of alleged peace: our fieldwork points at social and economic disenfranchisement, lack of equity and justice and a decay of authority. The third ponders who were the direct beneficiaries of post- 1990 peace. Disaggregating religious communities, it will explore how some leaders have confiscated <b>peace</b> <b>dividends</b> at the expenses of their constituencies.

40|$|Flight and {{emigration}} often continue {{despite the}} formal termination {{of war and}} significant international peace-building efforts because the international community often fails to address {{the root causes of}} flight and migration. Donors primarily aim at mitigating the direct consequences of war and pacifying elite groups rather than delivering <b>peace</b> <b>dividends</b> that benefit the broader population. The decision to flee during peacetime often closely relates to structural problems. Where peace is reduced to the mere absence of war and is of low quality, it is difficult to overcome major social cleavages. Thus the reasons for emigration persist. Three factors shape the quality of peace across specific contexts: (i) the level of violence beyond the recurrence of war, (ii) the degree of access to justice and political participation beyond a formal change of the political regime, and (iii) the generation of social and economic prospects and social mobi lity. Nepal and El Salvador are illustrative examples of the interplay of these factors at the interface between state and society. In these countries, state repression and other forms of violence persist, the political system is dominated by traditional elites or those that fought the war, and youths and former combatants lack prospects for the future. Policy Implications International actors need to adapt their strategies in post-war societies {{in a way that they}} support the broader population and not just the interests of the elite. While the termination of war and the introduction of democratisation might be first steps in this direction, they alone do not automatically lead to sustainable quality peace...|$|R

40|$|This study {{sets out}} to examine what lessons {{can be learned from}} Sudan’s Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) 2005, with {{particular}} relevance to power-sharing. The author went to on a field-trip to Khartoum, Juba and Nairobi in July 2009 to complement his previous knowledge the Sudan conflict.   The report draws ten lessons learned, and these are divided into the three aspects of process, provisions and implementation. In terms of the process, the report suggests that negotiators should strive to involve both regional actors and actors from the international community, focus on the functioning of the agreement, and seek to enhance the capacity-building of the parties. In relation to the key provision, power-sharing, the report calls for mediators to be wary of including exit options in power-sharing deals. The effects of exclusion and inclusion of various actors should be scrutinized and {{it is important that the}} message of the agreement is conveyed to various constituencies. Also, it is important to bring <b>peace</b> <b>dividends</b> for the people to increase the legitimacy of the agreement. Regarding the implementation phase, three key lessons are learned. First, for a successful implementation it is essential to keep the momentum of the signing. Secondly, the signing of an agreement is the start, not the end, of building a durable peace. Finally, the research findings demonstrate the importance of maintaining the moment ripe for implementation after the agreement is signed. One way of facilitating this is by keeping the same parties involved during the implementation process as during the negotiations. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{initiative}} by the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) {{to establish}} County Support Bases (CSBs) in 35 counties, {{in addition to}} the presence it already has in 10 state capitals, reflects a new interest in UN peacekeeping operations in pursuing a greater nexus between peacekeeping and peacebuilding, especially at the local level. In principle, the CSBs are a positive development, representing a move towards focusing on areas where the need is greatest – but they have also given rise to several concerns. Internally, UNMISS has had to reassess how fast it can move and what it can achieve with the CSBs. The CSBs are intended to ‘facilitate the extension of state authority’, and serve as a vehicle for integration with the UN Country Team (UNCT), who are the ones who can actually bring tangible development and <b>peace</b> <b>dividends</b> to isolated rural areas. Externally, the CSBs are expected to have an enabling effect on the extension of state authority through co-location of UNMISS staff with government counterparts in the counties. Given the delays encountered in CSB construction, it is not yet possible to fully assess their impact, although partial presence and air movement has already facilitated what is often the only link between state authorities and rural communities. This policy brief focuses on exploring the conceptual thinking and vision behind the CSBs, the efforts to achieve greater integration between UNMISS and UNCT, the challenges UNMISS has been facing in developing the CSBs, and how the UN plans to use CSBs in the future...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} the disjuncture between the policy transposition of the Liberal Peace Project (LPP) in South Sudan from the country's local context. It underlines how deep rooted historical exclusion from {{social welfare services}} reinforces political exclusion and exacerbates poor civic engagement among different ethnicities in the country causing a constant relapse to violence. The study combines a qualitative review of data from Afrobarometer, the National Democratic Institute, international NGOs, and South Sudan's government reports within depth interviews and participants' observation. The research finds that restricted access to formal education alongside the conservative and orthodox approaches to peacebuilding, which broadly focus on centralised urban political institutions and exclude diverse local needs and preferences, limit citizenship participation to elections and preclude an equitable social order in South Sudan, establishing a continuum of fragile authoritarian peace, institutional peace and constitutional peace. In an emancipatory approach, the study proposes a framework that prioritizes an extended access to primary and post-primary vocational education as a more credible establishment for sustainable civil peace in the country. The LPP {{by the international community}} needs to be tailored to enhance the political will of the South Sudan government to extend free primary education access, incentivize primary education with school feeding programmes and to invigorate vocational training curricula. These will yield civil <b>peace</b> <b>dividends,</b> which avert South Sudan's structural source of relapse into violence with sustainable disincentives.
