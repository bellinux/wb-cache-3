2500|$|The {{traditional}} way {{to analyze the}} ascorbic acid content {{is the process of}} titration with an oxidizing agent, and several procedures have been developed, mainly relying on iodometry. Iodine is used {{in the presence of a}} starch indicator. Iodine is reduced by ascorbic acid, and, when all the ascorbic acid has reacted, the iodine is then in excess, forming a blue-black complex with the starch indicator. [...] This indicates the end-point of the titration. As an alternative, ascorbic acid can be treated with iodine in excess, followed by back titration with sodium thiosulfate using starch as an indicator. The preceding iodometric method has been revised to exploit reaction of ascorbic acid with iodate and iodide in acid solution. Electrolyzing the solution of potassium iodide produces iodine, which reacts with ascorbic acid. The end of process is determined by <b>potentiometric</b> titration in a manner similar to Karl Fischer titration. The amount of ascorbic acid can be calculated by Faraday's law.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>potentiometric</b> {{surface is}} the {{imaginary}} plane where a given reservoir of fluid will [...] "equalize out to" [...] if allowed to flow. A <b>potentiometric</b> surface {{is based on}} hydraulic principles. For example, we know that two connected storage tanks with one full and one empty will gradually fill/drain to the same level. This is because of atmospheric pressure and gravity. This idea is heavily used in city water supplies - a tall tower containing the water supply has a great enough <b>potentiometric</b> surface to provide flowing water at a decent pressure to the houses it supplies.|$|E

50|$|Electrical and {{electrochemical}} detection {{are easily}} adapted for portability and miniaturization, especially {{in comparison to}} optical detection. In amperometric biosensors, an enzyme-catalyzed redox reaction causes a redox electron current that is measured by a working electrode.

In <b>potentiometric</b> biosensors, measurements of electric potential at one electrode are made in reference to another electrode. Examples of <b>potentiometric</b> biosensors include ion-sensitive field effect transistors (ISFET), Chemical field-effect transistors (chem-FET), and light-addressable <b>potentiometric</b> sensors (LAPS). In conductometric biosensors, changes in electrical impedance between two electrodes are measured {{as a result of a}} biomolecular reaction. Conductive measurements are simple and easy to use because there is no need for a specific reference electrode, and have been used to detect biochemicals, toxins, nucleic acids, and bacterial cells.|$|E

50|$|<b>Potentiometric</b> sensors {{measure a}} {{potential}} or charge accumulation of an electrochemical cell.

The ISE features a membrane that selectively interacts with the charged ion of interest, causing the accumulation of a charge potential compared to the reference electrode. The reference electrode provides a constant half-cell potential that is unaffected by analyte concentration. A high impedance voltmeter is {{used to measure the}} electromotive force or potential between the two electrodes when zero or no signiﬁcant current ﬂows between them.
