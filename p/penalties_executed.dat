50|$|Probably {{the most}} remembered save by Antonio Roma was the <b>penalty</b> <b>executed</b> by Brazilian River's player Delem, {{that he sent}} to the corner. With only two rounds {{before the end of}} the 1962 championship, Boca and its all-time derby River Plate shared the first {{position}} at the local league. The decisive match was played at La Bombonera, Boca Juniors home stadium. Boca was ahead 1:0 when referee Nai Foino conceded a penalty to River. After the save, the public invaded the field delaying the continuation of the match for 11 minutes. River was not able to change the score, and Boca finally won that championship after defeating Estudiantes de La Plata in the next round.|$|R

50|$|A Walsh {{innovation}} was scripting {{the first}} 15 offensive plays of the game. Walsh {{went as far}} as to script the first 25 plays but most teams stop at 15. Since the offensive team knew that the first 15 plays would be run as scripted no matter what, they could practice those plays to perfection, minimizing mistakes and penalties. By ignoring situational play-calling and increasing the game tempo, scripted plays also served to confuse the defense and induce early <b>penalties.</b> <b>Executing</b> these plays successfully could establish momentum and dictate the flow of the game. It also gave the coaching staff an opportunity to run test plays against the defense to gauge their reactions in game situations. Later in the game, an observed tendency in a certain situation by the opposing defense could be exploited.|$|R

40|$|A superscalar {{processor}} supporting speculative ex-ecution {{requires an}} instruction fetch mechanism {{that can provide}} instruction fetch addresses as nearly cor-rect as possible {{and as soon as}} possible in order to re-duce the likelihood of throwing away speculative work. In this paper we propose a comprehensive instruction fetch mechanism to satisfy that need. Implementation issues are identified, possible solutions and designs for resolving those issues are simulated, and the results of these simulations are presented. A metric for measur-ing the average <b>penalty</b> of <b>executing</b> a branch instruc-tion is introduced and used to evaluate the perform-ance of our instruction fetch mechanism. We achieve an average performance of 1. 19 IPC on the original SPEC benchmarks in a machine which can execute five instructions ideally by using the proposed mech-anism. ...|$|R
50|$|Since {{the basic}} {{instruction}} set is the same, {{there is almost}} no performance <b>penalty</b> for <b>executing</b> protected mode x86 code. This is unlike Intel's IA-64, where differences in the underlying instruction set means that running 32-bit code must be done either in emulation of x86 (making the process slower) or with a dedicated x86 processor. However, on the x86-64 platform, many x86 applications could benefit from a 64-bit recompile, due to the additional registers in 64-bit code and guaranteed SSE2-based FPU support, which a compiler can use for optimization. However, applications that regularly handle integers wider than 32 bits, such as cryptographic algorithms, will need a rewrite of the code handling the huge integers in order {{to take advantage of the}} 64-bit registers.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an evaluation of}} the BBCS scheme meant to alleviate the performance degradation experienced byVector Processors (VPs) when manipulating sparse matrices. In particular we address the execution of Sparse Matrix Vector Multiplication (SMVM) algorithms on VPs. First weintroduce a Block Based Compressed Storage (BBCS) sparse matrix representation format variants, and a BBCS based SMVM algorithm. Subsequently, we consider a set of benchmark matrices, report some preliminary performance evaluations, and compare our scheme with the Jagged Diagonal (JD) scheme. Our experiments suggest that our scheme achieves an average vector register filling larger then the one achieved by JD and that is not sensitive to the assumed value of the VP section size. Due to reduction of the startup <b>penalty</b> when <b>executing</b> vector instructions, higher vector register filling will translate into higher performance. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{fragmentation}} {{problem in}} multicomputer systems reduces the system utilization and prohibits the systems from performing at their full capacity. In this paper, we propose a generic job allocation method for multicomputer systems based on job size reduction. We reduce the subsystem size requirement adaptively {{according to the}} availability of processors. The fragmentation problem is greatly alleviated by this approach. To ensure that the benefit of reducing fragmentation is not outweighed by the <b>penalty</b> of <b>executing</b> jobs on less number of processors, we restrict {{the number of times}} the size of a job can be reduced; hence the name restricted size reduction (RSR). Extensive simulations are conducted to validate the RSR method for hypercubes and mesh-based systems with different allocation algorithms. It is observed in both mesh and hypercube that by using the RSR method a simple algorithm can provide better performance than the more sophisticated allocation algorithms. We have also comp [...] ...|$|R
