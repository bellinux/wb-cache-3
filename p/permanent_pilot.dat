40|$|The ATISS {{measurement}} drone, {{developed at}} the University of Applied Sciences Wildau, is an electrical powered motor glider with a maximum take-off weight of 25 kg including a payload capacity of 10 kg. Two 2. 5 kW engines enable ultra short take-off procedures and the motor glider design results in a 1 h endurance. The concept of ATISS {{is based on the}} idea to strictly separate between aircraft and payload functions, which makes ATISS a very flexible research platform for miscellaneous payloads. ATISS is equipped with an autopilot for autonomous flight patterns but under <b>permanent</b> <b>pilot</b> control from the ground. On the basis of ATISS the project SALSA was undertaken. The aim was to integrate a system for digital terrain modelling. Instead of a laser scanner a new design concept was chosen based on two synchronized high resolution digital cameras, one in a fixed nadir orientation and the other in a oblique orientation. Thus from every object on the ground images from different view angles are taken. This new measurement camera system MACS-TumbleCam was {{developed at the}} German Aerospace Center DLR Berlin-Adlershof especially for the ATISS payload concept. Special advantage in comparison to laser scanning is the fact, that instead of a cloud of points a surface including texture is generated and a high-end inertial orientation system can be omitted. The first test flights show a ground resolution of 2 cm and height resolution of 3 cm, which underline the extraordinary capabilities of ATISS and the MACS measurement camera system...|$|E
40|$|This article {{explores the}} ethical binom promise-expectation {{specific}} to the relationship firm-consumer,being built upon certain previous researches which discovered: significant changes in consumers’ values and life styles influencing the process of collectingin- formation about products; efforts carried out by com- panies {{in order to understand}} the present consumer’ requirements, to prioritize their requirements, co-operate with them to suggest priorities and enhance satisfaction; the growing manifestation of certain ethical attitudes of both companies and consumers. Not only did we ask ourselves why these ethical attitudes don’ t transform more rapidly or always in ethical behaviours in both cases but also what is actually happening at the level of the relationship between the two behaviours in the <b>permanent</b> <b>pilot</b> station which is the shop. As there is no field or activity which can be independent from ethics, the more it is available in case of marketing, the marketing function being excessively aimed at by the ethical criticism. Managerial ethics is strongly connected with social responsability, not identical, the latter becoming a corporate marketing strategy adopted by management who may no longer choose ethical indifference. As the sole existance of a code of ethical behaviour does not yet solve the problem, measures taken to clarify both monitoring and implementation procedures are growing, as well as the development level of the code and the way of supporting and adhering to this standard. Which is valid also in case of shops, as a connection point between thecitizen and the local community which is confrontingwith the challenge represented by the growing pressure with ethical connotations of customers’ expectations. It is important to mention that for some time the International Association for the Distributive Trade, AIDA Brussels oferrs the Trophy „The Victory of Ethics”. It is the industry and commerce responsability to properly communicate and ensure the comfort ofconsumers, building their trust. Consumers, to make decisions regarding their actions, go through perceptual and learning processes, and trying to harmonize their own desires with the moral behaviour which favours the well-being of the society gives them certain internal tensions. Despite the increase in ethical preocupations however ethical attitudes and preocupations of consumers are not always manifested in their actual behaviour. Our paper puts forward an understanding of the progress made in terms of effectiv ethical commitement at the organizational level and consumer level, trying to provide direction to further research of the common experience synthesized by the ethical binom promise-expectation, that will generate new knowledge. ethical promises & expectations, ethical behaviour, effective ethical engagement managerial ethics, corporate social responsibility, moral corporate performance, ethical marketing. ...|$|E

By June 1946, the Squadron was assigned to 7 Wing SAAF based at AFB Waterkloof, flying Harvards but still retaining the Spitfires. In 1947 the concept of the Active citizen Force was introduced whereby <b>permanent</b> force <b>pilots</b> would fly the squadron aircraft in the week and citizen force pilot officers would pilot the same Harvards and Spitfires over the weekends.

50|$|Another {{disadvantage}} of using burning appliances connected to natural draught chimneys without pilot lights {{is the lack}} of the starting draught in the chimney. Without a pilot light the chimney can cool down completely to the outside temperature, therefore there is no chimney draught this case at all, or there can be even a negative chimney draught if the outside temperature is higher than the inner temperature in the house. This case there is a backflow in the chimney. This is the reason of feeling the smell of soot at summertime at the chimneys openings. If there is a backflow in the chimney, {{it is possible that the}} cool air and the hot flue gases both entering into the appliance’s room via the openings of the gas appliance draught diverter, which can cause high level of carbon-monoxide in the air of the room, resulting possible deaths or permanent disability. In such a situation there is no strong physical effect which would drive the flue gases into the chimney, so the power, which cause the backflow in the chimney can be determinative. According to statistics the “starting draught” in chimneys assured by the <b>permanent</b> <b>pilots</b> has an important role to prevent an increase in the number of carbon monoxide poisonings. So in case of open fired appliances and natural draught chimneys the goals of the energy savings and the safety aspects are opposite.|$|R

50|$|As with surfing and windsurfing, {{there are}} {{a large number of}} diving schools and clubs {{throughout}} the coast of Tenerife. On the island there are up to thirty areas for diving where it is possible not only to discover interesting marine flora and fauna, but also in some places to explore the wrecks of sunken ships. Among the best places for diving are Las Galletas, Playa Paraíso and the Punta de la Rasca al Sur, as well as Garachico, Puerto de la Cruz or the Punta de Teno al Norte.

50|$|With their design, {{size and}} axle loading, they were {{intended}} for mixed traffic duties, hauling both freight and passenger trains. They found regular use primarily on the Waterford-Mallow-Tralee line and also on the Tralee-Newcastle West-Limerick line.

However, during the 1960s many of the secondary lines that they were used on were closed and following the arrival of the 181 Class, the 101s were relegated to goods, <b>permanent</b> way and <b>pilot</b> duties.|$|R
50|$|After a year tour in Africa, Kit {{returned}} to the United States as a P-47 instructor at Bradley Field near Hartford, Connecticut. He was then assigned as a maintenance flight test pilot and sent to Maintenance Engineering School at Chanute Air Force Base. After completion of that school his commander {{found out about the}} Flight Test School at Wright Field and decided to send him there. Here was where Kit got his big break as he quickly found out this school was not for functional test flights, but for experimental test programs. He kept his mouth shut and stuck with the program, and soon was offered the opportunity to be the first <b>permanent</b> test <b>pilot</b> to be assigned to Muroc Airfield (later Edwards Air Force Base) in the California desert. Until then, pilots were based at the Wright Field Test Center and assigned TDY as needed to Muroc. Chuck Yeager was making such trips out there from the Test Center while he was flying the Bell X-1 on the first supersonic test flights. In early tests Kit was able to fly some of America’s earliest jet aircraft including the Bell XP-59 and the P-80. He also flew the P-51, P-82, F-84, B-25, B-43, B-45 and many other fighter and bomber aircraft.|$|R

50|$|There are {{currently}} 300 full and 20 provisional members of Division II with seven institutions moving to full membership in September 2015. Division II schools {{tend to be}} smaller public universities and many private institutions. A large minority of Division II institutions (133 schools / 42%) have fewer than 2,499 students. Only six institutions have more than 15,000 students. Division II has a diverse membership, with two active member institutions in Alaska and four in Hawaii. Additionally, {{it is the only}} division that has member institutions in Puerto Rico and the only division that has expanded its membership to include an international member institution. Simon Fraser University became the first institution outside the US to enter the NCAA membership process. This occurred after the Division II Membership Committee accepted the institution's application during a July 7-9 meeting in Indianapolis, Indiana. Simon Fraser, located in the Vancouver suburb of Burnaby, British Columbia, began a two-year candidacy period September 1, 2009. Prospective members also must complete at least one year of provisional status before being accepted as full-time Division II members. In the fall of 2012, the NCAA President's Council officially approved Simon Fraser University as the organization's first international member. In April 2017, the NCAA made <b>permanent</b> the <b>pilot</b> program under which Simon Fraser was admitted to the NCAA.

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Congress is considering the reauthorization of the six franchise fund pilots authorized by the Government Reform Act of 1994.

The authorization {{for most of the}} pilots will expire at the end of fiscal year 2003. In addition to the suggestion of giving the <b>pilots</b> <b>permanent</b> authorization, there has been some discussion in recent years of expanding the franchise fund concept so that all departments and independent agencies can set up a franchise fund. To provide the context to evaluate franchise fund pilots and fully understand reauthorization issues, GAO agreed to identify the many funds, called intragovernmental revolving funds, that operate with purposes similar to that of franchise funds and to analyze their legal authorities to determine if franchise funds were somehow unique. In addition, we examined the operations and managerial cost accounting processes of the franchise fund pilots at the Departments of the Interior and Commerce. We determined if they had taken into account the criteria suggested by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), including: (1) adhering to OMB/Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Council's 12 business operating principles, (2) accounting for full cost, and (3) conducting audits of financial statements at the fund level. ...|$|R
40|$|The study {{describes}} the design, installation, testing {{and use of}} a <b>pilot</b> <b>permanent</b> GPS stations network in Cyprus, for mapping purposes. In addition, it evaluates its operation {{in order to produce}} the infrastructure mainly for mobile mapping applications but also any other type of relevant applications. The Continuously Reference Station Network is designed and established according to various quality criteria, which are discussed. Several applications using all the available information in static, kinematic in post process and RTK using virtual reference station technique and autonomous navigation mode are carried out. Three main groups of applications for mobile mapping are identified and investigated: the first group concerns applications requiring low accuracies (up to 10 m), the second group concerns applications requiring medium accuracies (up to 1 m), and the final group concerns applications requiring high accuracies (up to few cm). A detail report about the experimental results, aspects and conclusions is presented. Emphasis is also put on a digital aerial acquisition project, using GPS/INS measurements. Furthermore, in order to test the effectiveness of using C/A code-data for low cost DGPS applications in real time, appropriate software using the VRS technique is developed. For that reason measurements of three permanent GPS stations are analyzed for a determination of a kinematic chain which took place in the broader area of Pafos, Cyprus. The positional accuracy of the path is finally assessed by comparing the results with post processed trajectory. The results showed that using the VRS station concept with our developed software named “ 3 VRS”, similar accuracies can be achieved in distances of up to 20 km from the nearest reference station as for short baselines in the single station concept. 1...|$|R
