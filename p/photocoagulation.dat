25|$|Cryotherapy (freezing) or laser <b>photocoagulation</b> are {{occasionally}} used {{alone to}} wall off {{a small area}} of retinal detachment so that the detachment does not spread.|$|E
25|$|Panretinal <b>photocoagulation,</b> or PRP (also called scatter laser treatment), is used {{to treat}} proliferative {{diabetic}} retinopathy (PDR). The {{goal is to create}} 1,600 – 2,000 burns in the retina with the hope of reducing the retina's oxygen demand, and hence the possibility of ischemia. It is done in multiple sittings.|$|E
25|$|Laser <b>photocoagulation</b> {{can be used}} in two {{scenarios}} for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy. It can be used to treat macular edema by creating a Modified Grid at the posterior pole and it can be used for panretinal coagulation for controlling neovascularization. It is widely used for early stages of proliferative retinopathy.|$|E
25|$|There {{are good}} results from {{multiple}} doses of intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF {{drugs such as}} bevacizumab. A 2017 systematic review update found moderate evidence that aflibercept may have advantages in improving visual outcomes over bevacizumab and ranibizumab, after one year. Present recommended treatment for diabetic macular edema is Modified Grid laser <b>photocoagulation</b> combined with multiple injections of anti-VEGF drugs.|$|E
25|$|In {{those with}} a retinal tear, efforts to prevent it {{becoming}} a detachment include cryotherapy using a cold probe or <b>photocoagulation</b> using a laser. Treatment of retinal detachment should be carried out in a timely manner. This may include scleral buckling where silicone is sutured {{to the outside of}} the eye, pneumatic retinopexy where gas is injected into the eye, or vitrectomy where the vitreous is partly removed and replaced with either gas or oil.|$|E
25|$|Triamcinolone is a {{long acting}} steroid preparation. When {{injected}} in the vitreous cavity, it decreases the macular edema (thickening of the retina at the macula) caused due to diabetic maculopathy, and results {{in an increase in}} visual acuity. The effect of triamcinolone is transient, lasting up to three months, which necessitates repeated injections for maintaining the beneficial effect. Best results of intravitreal Triamcinolone have been found in eyes that have already undergone cataract surgery. Complications of intravitreal injection of triamcinolone include cataract, steroid-induced glaucoma and endophthalmitis. A systematic review found evidence that eyes treated with the intravitreal injection of triamcinolone had better visual acuity outcomes compared to eyes treated with macular laser grid <b>photocoagulation,</b> or sham injections.|$|E
2500|$|Nd:YAG lasers [...] {{are used}} in {{ophthalmology}} to correct posterior capsular opacification, a condition that may occur after cataract surgery, and for peripheral iridotomy in patients with acute angle-closure glaucoma, where it has superseded surgical iridectomy. Frequency-doubled Nd:YAG lasers (wavelength 532nm) are used for pan-retinal <b>photocoagulation</b> in patients with diabetic retinopathy. In certain cases these lasers are also used to treat eye floaters.|$|E
2500|$|This {{operation}} is generally {{performed in the}} doctor's office under local anesthesia. It is another method of repairing a retinal detachment in which a gas bubble (SF6 or C3F8 gas) is injected into the eye after which laser or freezing treatment {{is applied to the}} retinal hole. [...] The patient's head is then positioned so that the bubble rests against the retinal hole. Patients may have to keep their heads tilted for several days to keep the gas bubble in contact with the retinal hole. The surface tension of the gas/water interface seals the hole in the retina, and allows the retinal pigment epithelium to pump the subretinal space dry and [...] "suck the retina back into place". This strict positioning requirement makes the treatment of the retinal holes and detachments that occurs in {{the lower part of the}} eyeball impractical. This procedure is usually combined with cryopexy or laser <b>photocoagulation.</b> Pneumatic retinopexy has significantly lower success rates compared to scleral buckle surgery and vitrectomy. Some initially successful cases will fail during the weeks and months after surgery. In some of the failed cases, an area of the retina which was healthy and attached prior to the initial pneumatic retinopexy repair procedure develops new tears and/or becomes detached. A recent Cochrane Review compared outcomes [...] from patients receiving retinal reattachment from pneumatic retinopexy versus scleral buckle. Though the quality of evidence from two randomized controlled trials was low, eyes having received the pneumatic retinopexy procedure were more likely to have a recurrence of retinal detachment by follow-up, and were 11% less likely to achieve retinal reattachment, compared to scleral buckle.|$|E

50|$|Laser <b>photocoagulation,</b> which {{effectively}} burns {{the leak}} area shut, {{may be considered}} in cases where there is little improvement in a 3 to 4-month duration, and the leakage is confined to a single or a few sources of leakage {{at a safe distance}} from the fovea. However, for many cases the leak is very near the central macula, where <b>photocoagulation</b> would leave a blind spot or the leakage is widespread and its source is difficult to identify. Foveal attenuation has been associated with more than 4 months' duration of symptoms, however a better long-term outcome has not been demonstrated with laser <b>photocoagulation</b> than without <b>photocoagulation.</b> Laser <b>photocoagulation</b> can permanently damage vision where applied. Carefully tuned lasers can limit this damage. Even so, laser <b>photocoagulation</b> is not a preferred treatment for leaks in the central vision and is considered an outdated treatment by some doctors.|$|E

50|$|Treatment {{options for}} macular {{telangiectasia}} type 1 include laser <b>photocoagulation,</b> intra-vitreal injections of steroids, or anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents. <b>Photocoagulation</b> was recommended by Gass and remains {{to date the}} mainstay of treatment. It seems {{to be successful in}} causing resolution of exudation and VA improvement or stabilization in selected patients. <b>Photocoagulation</b> should be used sparingly to reduce the chance of producing a symptomatic paracentral scotoma and metamorphopsia. Small burns (100-200 μm) of moderate intensity in a grid-pattern and on multiple occasions, if necessary, are recommended. It is unnecessary to destroy every dilated capillary, and, particularly during the initial session of <b>photocoagulation,</b> those {{on the edge of the}} capillary-free zone should be avoided.|$|E
