5|$|During the Second World War, gun {{batteries}} {{were built}} on the island. A twin six <b>pounder</b> emplacement at Galtness Battery on the coast at Salt Ness protected the Wide Firth from German torpedo boats. A Castle Battery was operational from 1941–43, as was an anti-aircraft battery. Mains electricity arrived on Shapinsay in the 1970s, when an underwater cable was laid from Kirkwall.|$|E

However, these were {{handed over to the}} Free French at Kufra. The unit was then issued a 25 <b>pounder</b> portee.

5|$|The {{ship was}} {{fitted with a}} single QF 6 <b>pounder</b> Hotchkiss {{anti-aircraft}} (AA) gun from October 1914 {{to the end of}} 1915. In March 1915, a single QF 3 inch 20 cwt AA gun was added. It was provided with 500 rounds. The battlecruiser's 4-inch guns were enclosed in casemates and given blast shields during a refit in November to better protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action. Two aft guns were removed at the same time.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} design faults of the Tetrarch were {{revealed}} through its operational use. Its size limited the possible crew to three, a {{driver in the}} hull and a gunner and commander in the turret, resulting in too few crew members to operate the Tetrarch effectively. The gunner or commander, {{in addition to his}} own duties, had to act as loader for the 2 <b>pounder,</b> which caused delays in combat. A report on the tank written in January 1941 stated that as the commander had to both fight and control the tank, controlling a troop of Tetrarchs during combat would be almost impossible.|$|E
5|$|Black {{connects the}} attempt {{on their lives}} to Schlossburg's murder. He demands details of the case from Watts, who {{explains}} that the mummy found earlier dates to early Christianity, {{the time when the}} Millennium Group first convened.

H. <b>Pounder),</b> a fellow Group member who has worked with them in the past. She offers her help but Watts declines it. Watts is later able to access Schlossburg's computer files; meanwhile, the doctor is found to be alive, regaining consciousness in a hospital bed and telling police his assailant was Watts.|$|E
