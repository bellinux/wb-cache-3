5|$|Despite the NASA <b>prohibition</b> <b>on</b> commercializing the medallions, since 1995 {{there have}} been over 500 {{internet}} or live auction appearances of Apollo mission Robbins medallions.

Between both auction companies, the top 10 prices realized range from US$30,000 to nearly $62,000, all for sterling silver medallions from either Apollo 11 or Apollo 17.|$|E

5|$|The Sihanaka have a {{generally}} egalitarian social structure, with the eldest male {{at the head}} of the family. Traditional beliefs predominate, although Christianity has also had an influence. Social life here, as elsewhere in Madagascar, is guided by the principles of respect for the ancestors and the fady (taboos) established by them. Traditional social practices include complex funeral and divorce rites and a strong and continuing <b>prohibition</b> <b>on</b> working in paddy fields on Tuesdays.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Nagle had a Pomeranian and a Bulldog, but {{was promised}} {{she could have}} a larger dog once her {{schooling}} was completed. In 1913 her dream came to fruition with the purchase of her first Irish Wolfhound, Manin Michael, for £5. James Nagle subsequently registered the dog with the Kennel Club, before it {{was transferred to the}} ownership of Mr and Mrs Nagle, and its name changed to Sir Michael of Sheppey in May 1917. Food shortages during the First World War resulted in an official <b>prohibition</b> <b>on</b> dog breeding, but Nagle ignored it and bred her first litter from a bitch called Lady Alma of Sheppey.|$|E

Indeed, the period of Prohibition in the United States between 1920 and 1933 due to the Eighteenth Amendment and the Volstead Act often is referred to simply as [...] "Prohibition", as is the [...] "War on Drugs" [...] that succeeded it. An additional example, called nettle war: Since 2002 in France the sale of nettle liquid manure was prohibited, and since 2006, unauthorized plant protection products (such as nettle liquid manure) to sell, own and operate. Even advertising and recommendations for these products were not allowed. Only since 2011, it was legalized again.

5|$|Buczynski welcomed {{a number}} of friends and flatmates, {{including}} Geraci, into the Huntington coven, and later stated his desire to personally initiate Geraci up to the third degree; Saperton disagreed, citing the traditional Gardnerian <b>prohibition</b> <b>on</b> anyone initiating {{a member of the}} same sex. Buczynski thought that her attitude was homophobic, and subsequently abandoned both her and Gardnerian Wica. Meanwhile, he and Geraci moved out of their crowded apartment into a new flat in Middle Village. Despite same-sex marriage not being legally recognised at the time, they undertook a private wedding ceremony to marry one another, although were non-monogamous, and would go together to gay bath houses to partake in sexual activity with other patrons, resulting in Buczynski's contraction of several sexually transmitted infections.|$|E
5|$|Dixon {{represented}} Henderson County at the Kentucky constitutional {{convention of}} 1849. In this capacity, he ensured that strong protections of slave property {{were included in}} the Kentucky Constitution of 1850. Later, the General Assembly chose Dixon to fill the unexpired Senate term of Henry Clay. He served from September 1, 1852, to March 3, 1855, and did not stand for re-election. During his short tenure, Dixon's major accomplishment was convincing Stephen Douglas to include language in the Kansas-Nebraska Act that explicitly repealed the Missouri Compromise's <b>prohibition</b> <b>on</b> slavery north of latitude 36°30'.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, the Canadian Gaming Association {{commissioned}} {{an opinion}} on the legality of DFS in Canada from former Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario general counsel Don Bourgeois. He determined that DFS would likely be classified as a game of chance under Canadian law, going on to say {{in an interview that}} under the Criminal Code of Canada, games that mix chance- and skill-based elements are considered games of chance. However, Canadian authorities have not yet targeted DFS services; historically, the government has only targeted illegal gambling operations that have a presence within the country. While the service Sport Select offers legal sports wagering games through Canada's lotteries, it is subject to a legal <b>prohibition</b> <b>on</b> wagering on individual sporting events.|$|E

The assassination prohibition does not apply to killings in self-defense.|$|E
5|$|Restrictions on Jews {{were already}} in place before the invasion, {{including}} a <b>prohibition</b> <b>on</b> marrying Christians. After the invasion, Randolph Braham writes, the Hungarian government immediately began the process of isolating Jews {{from the rest of}} the community. From 5 April Jews over the age of six had to wear a 3.8 x 3.8inch (10 x 10cm) yellow badge. They were forbidden from using telephones, owning cars or radios, travelling or moving home, and had to declare the value of their property. Jewish civil servants, journalists and lawyers were sacked, non-Jews could not work in Jewish households. Books by Jews were removed from libraries and Jewish authors could no longer be published.|$|E

Residents identified nuisance and illegal parking and excessive speed as {{of concern in}} the area, {{as well as the}} antisocial use of mini motos, quad bikes and motorcycles on the Kennet towpath. Measures to alleviate nuisance parking were introduced in early 2015 with a ban on parking on the road verge. In June 2015, signs were installed on the lane to Southcote Mill to warn motorcycle users of their <b>prohibition</b> <b>on</b> that right of way.|$|E

5|$|Under Oregon law, Goldschmidt {{would have}} been {{required}} to register as a sex offender, had he been convicted {{of the crime of}} third degree rape. The fact that the registration law didn't pass until 1997, after the illicit sexual relationship ended, would not have exempted him from registration. Oregon case law has determined that the registration of offenders whose acts were committed prior to the passage of the law does not violate either Oregon’s Constitution or the United States Constitution’s <b>prohibition</b> <b>on</b> ex post facto laws.|$|E

Americus' importation to England occurred before the imposition of the Jersey Act, which allowed him and his offspring to be registered in the General Stud Book, something that would not have happened had he been imported into England after 1913, due to the Jersey Act's <b>prohibition</b> <b>on</b> registering horses tracing to Lexington in the General Stud Book.|$|E

5|$|I-495 forms a wide loop {{around the}} outer edge of Greater Boston. Other major interstates in Massachusetts include I-291, I-391, I-84, I-195, I-395, I-290, and I-190. Major non-interstate {{highways}} in Massachusetts include U.S. Routes 1, 3, 6, and 20, and state routes 2, 3, 9, 24, and 128. A great majority of interstates in Massachusetts were constructed during the mid 20th century, and at times were controversial, particularly the intent to route I-95 northeastwards from Providence, Rhode Island, directly through central Boston, first proposed in 1948. Opposition to continued construction grew, and in 1970 Governor Francis W. Sargent issued a general <b>prohibition</b> <b>on</b> most further freeway construction within the I-95/Route 128 loop in the Boston area. A massive undertaking to bring I-93 underground in downtown Boston, called the Big Dig, brought the city's highway system under public scrutiny for its high cost and construction quality.|$|E
5|$|On January 14, 1919, Indiana {{became the}} twenty-fifth state {{to ratify the}} Eighteenth Amendment, which {{mandated}} nationwide prohibition. Three days later Nebraska became the thirty-sixth state to ratify the amendment, providing the two-thirds majority of states required to amend the U.S. Constitution. With the beginning of nationwide <b>Prohibition</b> <b>on</b> January 17, 1920, after formal ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment the previous day, efforts turned to enforcement of the new law. Protestant support for Prohibition remained intense in Indiana in the 1920s. Shumaker and the IASL lead a statewide grassroots campaign that successfully passed a new prohibition law for the state. Sponsored by Indiana representative Frank Wright and known as the Wright bone-dry law, it was enacted in 1925. The Wright law {{was part of a}} national trend toward stricter prohibition legislation and imposed severe penalties for alcohol possession.|$|E
5|$|On March 31, 2014, the FCC voted 3–2 {{to approve}} the {{proposed}} ban on joint sales agreements and voted 5–0 {{to approve the}} proposed ban on coordinated retransmission consent negotiations {{between two of the}} four highest-rated stations within a given market; the JSA ban went into effect on June 19, 2014. Under the restrictions, the FCC would rule on waivers to maintain select existing JSAs within 90 days of the application's filing. The FCC also began a request for comment on policies to address other agreements, such as shared services agreements. The <b>prohibition</b> <b>on</b> television JSAs had been proposed as early as 2004, a year after the FCC voted to treat JSAs between radio stations as duopolies. Despite this fact, broadcasting companies criticized the ban, accusing the Commission of using it as a move to encourage participation in a spectrum incentive auction then set to occur in 2015, and stating that the ban would place them at a disadvantage during retransmission consent negotiations with pay television providers.|$|E
