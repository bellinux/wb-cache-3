50|$|Installation of {{a control}} grid between the anode and the <b>pool</b> <b>cathode</b> allows {{control of the}} {{conduction}} of the valve, thereby giving control of the mean output voltage produced by the rectifier. Start of the current flow can be delayed past {{the point at which}} the arc would form in an uncontrolled valve. This allows the output voltage of a valve group to be adjusted by delaying the firing point, and allows controlled mercury-arc valves to form the active switching elements in an inverter converting direct current into alternating current.|$|E
40|$|A {{theoretical}} nalysis of {{the relevant}} thermodynamic and electrochemical data revealed that the electrolytic regenera-tion of the calcium reductant and the solvent salt from the spent salt of the neodymium oxide reduction process is feasi-ble. Electrolytic decomposition f CaO dissolved in CaC 12 -CaF 2 molten salt between a graphite anode and a Ca-Zn molten <b>pool</b> <b>cathode</b> was achieved at a potential higher than 2. 2 V, which was determined from current-voltage curves. Calcium recovery {{in the range of}} 10 to 20 % was obtained in these experiments. Electrolytic alcium transport experiments proved that the poor calcium recovery was not due to difficulty of calcium incorporation i to the Ca-Zn molten <b>pool</b> <b>cathode.</b> Chemical equil ibrium experiments along with chemical analysis of the phases established that the parasitic formation of calcium carbonate at the anode was the primary reason for the low calcium recovery. The production of Nd-Fe-B permanent magnets for dc motors by the Magnequench TM process (1) requires a sup-ply of low-cost neodymium etal. A process has been de-veloped (2 - 7) for the production of a low-cost Nd-Fe alloy by the direct reduction of Nd 203 with calcium in a CaC 12 -based solvent salt at temperatures between 710 ~ and 850...|$|E
40|$|Electroduction of {{a variety}} of benzylic mono- and 1, 3 -dibromides and of benzylmer curie halides at stirred mercury <b>pool</b> <b>cathode</b> leads to {{products}} that support a mechanism for the electro- duction of bromides that involves organomercury(I) intermediates and perhaps mercury (I) dimers. Products f ormed in {{the presence or absence of}} strongly adsorbed but eleotrochemically indifferent species suggest that monomolecular versus bimolecular reactions of the adsorbed organomercury(I) intermediates or dimers are strongly influenced by the presence of such species and that in some cases the reaction can be directed to one or another final product, providing a measure of control in synthetic applications...|$|E
50|$|A {{conventional}} mercury-arc rectifier {{is started}} by a brief high-voltage arc within the rectifier, between the <b>cathode</b> <b>pool</b> and a starting electrode. By {{one of a}} number of means, the starting electrode is brought into contact with the pool and allowed to pass current through an inductive circuit. The contact with the pool is then broken, resulting in a high emf and an arc discharge.|$|R
40|$|Electroreduotion of coal is {{studied in}} aqueous tetrabutylammonium {{hydroxide}} (TBAOH) solution and tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TBABF 4) -THF-H 2 O solution by using platinum as anode and Hg <b>pool</b> as <b>cathode.</b> The electrolysis in aqueous TBAOH solution {{seems to have}} {{little effect on the}} following HyPy although the pyridine extractable yield of reduced coal increases. In an undivided cell the re-oxidation of the reduced coal occurs. Cathodic reduction in TBABF 4 -THF-H 2 O solution gives a pronounced effect on HyPy. Higher conversion (60. 9 %) and total oil yield (50. 6 %) (THF soluble + oil formed in HyPy) are obtained in a divided cell as compared with 42. 1 % and 28. 4 % for untreated coal, respectively. The electroreduction pretreatment of coal enhances the rate of oil formation and the oil yield in HyPy of the reduced coal, indicating that the reduced coal can be depolymerized more easily due to the solvolysis and hydrogenation.

50|$|Glass {{envelope}} rectifiers {{can handle}} hundreds of kilowatts of direct-current {{power in a}} single unit. A six-phase rectifier rated 150 amperes has a glass envelope approximately 600 mm (24 inches) high by 300 mm (12 inches) outside diameter. These rectifiers will contain several kilograms of liquid mercury. The large size of the envelope is required due to the low thermal conductivity of glass. Mercury vapor in {{the upper part of}} the envelope must dissipate heat through the glass envelope in order to condense and return to the <b>cathode</b> <b>pool.</b> Some glass tubes were immersed in an oil bath to better control the temperature.|$|R
25|$|A {{rectifier}} used in high-voltage {{direct current}} (HVDC) power transmission systems and industrial processing between about 1909 to 1975 is a mercury-arc rectifier or mercury-arc valve. The device is enclosed in a bulbous glass vessel or large metal tub. One electrode, the cathode, is submerged {{in a pool}} of liquid mercury {{at the bottom of the}} vessel and one or more high purity graphite electrodes, called anodes, are suspended above the pool. There may be several auxiliary electrodes to aid in starting and maintaining the arc. When an electric arc is established between the <b>cathode</b> <b>pool</b> and suspended anodes, a stream of electrons flows from the cathode to the anodes through the ionized mercury, but not the other way (in principle, this is a higher-power counterpart to flame rectification, which uses the same one-way current transmission properties of the plasma naturally present in a flame).|$|R

Tittle of Thesis:,,ELECTROSYNTHESIS OF DELTA-VALERO LACTONES" In this project electrolysis {{has been used}} as a method for a synthesis of new compounds. The main aim is cathodic reduction of the carbon-chlorine bond in a series of aldol trichloroacetates. Formed carbanion would form a 6 member ring by attaching the carbonyl group. Two structures can be formed: α, α-dichloro-β-hydroxy-δ-lactones and α, β-unsaturated-α-chloro -δ-lactones from the starting esters using electrolysis. The whole process was performed at controlled potential in a separated cell, on mercury <b>pool</b> as a <b>cathode</b> and platinum as an anode in an argon atmosphere with dichloromethane/tetraethylamonium system. During the process two electrons have been passed. The synthesized lactones are completely new compounds. In this report also electrochemical and spectroscopy properties of those compounds have been characterized to provide for their other use...|$|R
40|$|The single stable {{cathode spot}} on the base metal unique to GMA-welded titanium, causes {{spattering}} ABSTRACT. Severe spattering occurs in low-current GMA W of titanium and tita-nium alloys. For example, 1. 6 -mm (V 16 ·in.) diameter Ti- 6 AI- 4 V welding wire spatters at direct current electrode-positive (DCEP) welding currents of less than 240 A, eject-ing almost 20 % of the filler metal from the weld. Using a high-speed camera, an analysis of metal-droplet transfer in the welding arc was carried out to {{determine the cause of}} the spatter. Spattering is not a result of the plasma jet repelling molten filler metal droplets from the base metal. Spattering follows a regular pattern. The transferring droplets touch down on the base plate and wet the weld pool. At low current levels, a portion of molten welding wire is pinched off and ejected from the vicinity of the weld pool before the droplet incorporates com-pletely, thus causing spatter. As the drop-let wets the weld <b>pool,</b> the <b>cathode</b> spot relocates from the weld pool {{to the top of the}} transferred, but unincorporated, drop-let. Cathode spot relocation from the weld pool to the droplet takes place in approximately 1. 1 ms, so the droplet top remains distinguishable from the weld pool for at least this length of time. The current levels that are associated with spatter are associated with globular trans-fer of filler metal droplets, and compara-tively slow droplet wire-to-plate transfer velocities. Below 240 A, droplet transfer velocities are typically 130 cm/s (4. 3 ft/s). The low droplet transfer velocities associ-ated with low-current welding allow a sufficiently lengthy incorporation lifetime for the spatter mechanism to operate. The force required to eject a spatte...|$|R
