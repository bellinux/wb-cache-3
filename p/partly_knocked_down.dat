5000|$|Single shot {{field tests}} {{performed}} without optimized nozzles {{led to the}} conclusion vortex rings were unsuitable for non-lethal crowd control. This conclusion was reached <b>partly</b> because <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> {{did not appear to}} be feasible at the desired range of 100 ft, partly because of the excessive spillage onto bystanders under the flight path if used to transport chemicals or dyes, and partly because the flight noise and speed enabled it to be easily avoided at the downrange target. [...] The foremost reliability issue with this project was turbulence caused by the high-energy propellant burning outside the barrel.|$|R

50|$|Originally {{intended}} for British use as light tank transporters in North Africa, they had wide rear tandems so that oversize 14.00x20 single tires could be used. 90 NR1 had cabs of the obsolete EX, models NR2 to NR7 had L series cabs, NR8 and later had open cabs. Other differences between models were body types, some components, and minor details. All were exported as <b>partly</b> <b>knocked</b> <b>down,</b> with the chassis, cab, and body shipped separately then assembled at their destination. Unlike most US trucks they had diesel engines, making them valuable for long distance trips. Over 15,000 were built between 1940 and 1944, {{the most of}} any series.|$|E

50|$|When a bowler takes a {{turn and}} <b>knocks</b> <b>down</b> the {{remaining}} pins, that bowler receives nine points for that shot, {{regardless of the}} number of pins <b>knocked</b> <b>down</b> to receive these nine points.If a bowler <b>knocks</b> <b>down</b> the remaining pins, except for the “12-Pin”/”Redhead”, that bowler receives 12 points for that shot regardless {{of the number of}} pins <b>knocked</b> <b>down</b> to receive those 12 points.|$|R
50|$|The {{rules of}} this game are {{slightly}} more complicated than the European version. Each bowler will roll the ball twice in each frame regardless {{of the number of}} pins <b>knocked</b> <b>down</b> on each roll. When a bowler’s turn is completed, the next bowler will not receive a “Full House” to bowl at: rather, the next bowler must attempt to <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> the pins that were left by the previous bowler. For example, if the first bowler is only able to <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> seven pins, the second bowler must attempt to <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> the remaining two pins. Should the second bowler be unsuccessful in <b>knocking</b> <b>down</b> both of these pins in the allotted two rolls, the third bowler will attempt to <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> the remaining pins. This will continue until the remaining pins are <b>knocked</b> <b>down</b> or {{until the end of the}} frame. Once all pins are <b>knocked</b> <b>down,</b> the “12-pin”/”Redhead” is left standing alone (see below), or the end of the frame is reached, all nine pins (a Full House) will be reset.|$|R
50|$|Play then changes hands, and Team B {{throws the}} batons at Team A's kubbs, but must first <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> any {{standing}} field kubbs. If a baseline kubb is <b>knocked</b> <b>down</b> before all remaining field kubbs, the baseline kubb {{is returned to}} its upright position. (Field kubbs that right themselves due to {{the momentum of the}} impact are considered <b>knocked</b> <b>down.</b> Also kubbs are considered <b>knocked</b> <b>down</b> if they end up tilting and relying on a game piece for support.) Again, all kubbs that are <b>knocked</b> <b>down</b> are thrown back over onto the opposite half of the field and then stood.|$|R

50|$|Duckpin bowling has rules {{similar to}} ten-pin bowling. In a 10-frame game, bowlers try to <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> pins in the fewest rolls per frame. Bowlers have three balls per frame, {{instead of two}} in ten-pin bowling, to knock over a set of 10 pins. If a bowler <b>knocks</b> <b>down</b> all 10 pins with their first roll in a frame, it is scored as a strike. If all the pins are <b>knocked</b> <b>down</b> in two rolls, the bowler has made a spare. If all the pins are <b>knocked</b> <b>down</b> in three rolls, it is scored as a ten, as in candlepins, with no bonus. If pins are still {{standing}} after the third ball, the bowler gets one point for each pin <b>knocked</b> <b>down.</b>|$|R

40|$|Protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) {{regulate}} {{virtually all}} biological processes. PTKs phosphorylate substrates in a sequence-specific manner and relatively short peptide sequences determine selectivity. Here, we developed {{new technology to}} determine PTK activity profiles using peptide arrays. The zebrafish is an excellent model system to investigate signaling in the whole organism, given its wealth of genetic tools, including morpholino-mediated <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> technology. We used zebrafish embryo lysates to determine PTK activity profiles, thus providing the unique opportunity to directly compare the effect of protein <b>knock</b> <b>downs</b> on PTK activity profiles {{on the one hand}} and phenotypic changes on the other. Methodology. We used multiplex arrays of 144 distinct peptides, spotted on a porous substrate, allowing the sample to be pumped up and down, optimizing reaction kinetics. Kinase reactions were performed using complex zebrafish embryo lysates or purified kinases. Peptide phosphorylation was detected by fluorescent anti-phosphotyrosine antibody binding and the porous chips allowed semi-continuous recording of the signal. We used morpholinos to <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> protein expression in the zebrafish embryos and subsequently, we determined the effects on the PTK activity profiles. Results and Conclusion. Reproducible PTK activity profiles were derived from one-day-old zebrafiish embryos. Morpholino-mediated <b>knock</b> <b>downs</b> of the Src family kinases, Fyn and Yes, induced characteristic phenotypes and distinct changes in the PTK activity profiles. Interestingly, the peptide substrates that were less phosphorylated upon Fyn and Yes <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> were preferential substrates of purified Fyn and Yes. Previously, we demonstrated that Wnt 11 <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> phenocopied Fyn/Yes <b>knock</b> <b>down.</b> Interestingly, Wnt 11 <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> induced similar changes in the PTK activity profile as Fyn/Yes <b>knock</b> <b>down.</b> The control Nacre/Mitfa <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> did not affect the PTK activity profile significantly. Our results indicate that the novel peptide chip technology can be used to unravel kinase signaling pathways in vivo...|$|R

50|$|Fights are won when a {{competitor}} is <b>knocked</b> <b>down</b> for a 10 count, <b>knocked</b> <b>down</b> 5 times or forced to submit. A fighter {{caught in a}} submission hold may grab the ropes to break the hold, but this counts as a 1/3 of a <b>knock</b> <b>down.</b> Grabbing the ropes 15 times equals a loss. Bouts that go to the full time limit are declared a draw.|$|R

5|$|Both {{the player}} and the {{opponent}} have stamina meters, both {{displayed on the}} top of the screen. The meters decrease when either boxer gets hit by a punch. Boxers will get <b>knocked</b> <b>down</b> if their stamina meter runs out.

Either boxer will lose if they cannot stand up before the count of ten after being <b>knocked</b> <b>down</b> (resulting in a knockout or KO) or if they are <b>knocked</b> <b>down</b> three times in the match (resulting in a technical knockout or TKO).
