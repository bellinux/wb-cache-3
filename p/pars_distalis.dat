5000|$|Pars distalis: The <b>pars</b> <b>distalis,</b> (distal part), {{comprises}} {{the majority of}} the anterior pituitary and is where the bulk of pituitary hormone production occurs. The <b>pars</b> <b>distalis</b> contains two types of cells including chromophobe cells and chromophil cells. The chromophils can be further divided into acidophils (alpha cells) and basophils (beta cells). These cells all together produce hormones of the anterior pituitary, and release them into the blood stream.|$|E
5000|$|The {{anterior}} lobe of the pituitary can {{be divided}} into the pars tuberalis (pars glandularis) and <b>pars</b> <b>distalis</b> (pars glandularis) that constitutes ~80% of the gland. The pars intermedia (the intermediate lobe) lies between the <b>pars</b> <b>distalis</b> and the pars tuberalis, and is rudimentary in the human, although in other species it is more developed. [...] It develops from a depression in the dorsal wall of the pharynx (stomal part) known as Rathke's pouch.|$|E
50|$|In some organisms, the proliferating {{anterior}} wall {{does not}} fully occupy Rathke's pouch, leaving a remnant (Rathke's cleft) between the <b>pars</b> <b>distalis</b> and pars intermedia.|$|E
5000|$|Pars intermedia: The pars intermedia, (intermediate part), sits {{between the}} <b>pars</b> <b>distalis</b> and the {{posterior}} pituitary, forming {{the boundary between}} the anterior and posterior pituitaries. It is very small and indistinct in humans.|$|E
50|$|The pouch {{eventually}} {{loses its}} {{connection with the}} pharynx giving rise to the anterior pituitary. The anterior wall of Rathke's pouch proliferates, filling most of the pouch to form <b>pars</b> <b>distalis</b> and pars tuberalis. The posterior wall forms pars intermedia.|$|E
50|$|ACTH is also {{produced}} by corticotropes in the <b>pars</b> <b>distalis</b> of the equine pituitary. In a normal horse, this {{accounts for the}} majority of ACTH production. ACTH produced by the <b>pars</b> <b>distalis</b> is subject to negative feedback in a normal horse, so high cortisol levels reduce ACTH production by the pituitary, subsequently reducing cortisol levels. In a horse with PPID, ACTH levels are high as a result of pars intermedia production, but it is not subject to negative feedback regulation. Despite the high levels of ACTH, cortisol levels vary, and are sometimes lower than normal. Additionally, hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex is infrequent. The role of ACTH is, therefore, still poorly understood.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{the human}} and canine forms of Cushing's disease, which most {{commonly}} affect the <b>pars</b> <b>distalis</b> region of the pituitary gland, equine Cushing's disease {{is a result of}} adenoma formation in the pars intermedia. This adenoma then secretes excessive amounts of normal products, leading to clinical signs.|$|E
50|$|The pouch {{eventually}} {{loses its}} {{connection with the}} pharynx, giving rise to the anterior pituitary. The anterior wall of Rathke's pouch proliferates, filling most of the pouch to form the <b>pars</b> <b>distalis</b> and the pars tuberalis. The posterior wall of the anterior pituitary forms the pars intermedia. Its formation from the soft tissues of the upper palate contrasts with the posterior pituitary, which originates from neuroectoderm.|$|E
50|$|The {{pituitary}} gland {{consists of three}} parts: the pars nervosa, the pars intermedia, and the <b>pars</b> <b>distalis.</b> The most critical structure to PPID, the pars intermedia, is regulated by the hypothalamus. The neurons of the hypothalamus innervate cells known as melanotropes within the pars intermedia, releasing dopamine which then binds to dopamine receptors on the melanotropes. Activation of these dopamine receptors leads to the inhibition of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) production from these cells.|$|E
50|$|This test {{may also}} be {{referred}} to as a ‘’resting ACTH’’, ’’endogenous ACTH’’, or ‘’basal ACTH’’. The majority of ACTH produced in normal horses comes from corticotrope cells in the <b>pars</b> <b>distalis,</b> with only 2% thought to come from melanotropes in the pars intermedia. In horses with PPID, melanotropes produce abnormally high levels of ACTH. Basal plasma ACTH concentrations, which measure the blood levels of circulating ACTH, can therefore be useful in diagnosing the disease.|$|E
5000|$|Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) receptors {{are present}} in both the melanotropes of the pars {{intermedia}} and the corticotropes in the <b>pars</b> <b>distalis.</b> The administration of exogenous TRH causes an increase in ACTH and α-MSH in plasma of both normal horses and those with PPID. In both cases, plasma ACTH peaks 2-10 minutes after administration, before slowly dropping to normal levels {{over the course of}} an hour. PPID horses, however, show a much greater peak than normal horses, especially in the autumn. [...] The test is relatively simple, involving one blood sample taken before TRH administration, and one 10 minutes following TRH.|$|E
50|$|The {{dexamethasone}} suppression test involves administering dexamethasone, {{a synthetic}} glucocorticoid, to the horse, and measuring its serum cortisol levels before and 19-24 hours after injection. In a normal horse, dexamethasone administration results in negative {{feedback to the}} pituitary, resulting in decreased ACTH production from the <b>pars</b> <b>distalis</b> and, therefore, decreased synthesis of cortisol {{at the level of}} the adrenal gland. A horse with PPID, which has an overactive pars intermedia not regulated by glucocorticoid levels, does not suppress ACTH production and, therefore, cortisol levels remain high. False negatives can occur in early disease. Additionally, dexamethasone administration may increase the risk of laminitis in horses already prone to the disease. For these reasons, the dexamethasone suppression test is currently not recommended for PPID testing.|$|E
5000|$|Pars tuberalis: The pars tuberalis, (tubular part), forms {{a part of}} the sheath {{extending}} up {{from the}} <b>pars</b> <b>distalis</b> which joins with the pituitary stalk (also known as the infundibular stalk or infundibulum), arising from the posterior lobe. (The pituitary stalk connects the hypothalamus to the posterior pituitary). The function of the pars tuberalis is poorly understood. However it has been seen to be important in receiving the endocrine signal in the form of TSHB (a β subunit of TSH) informing the pars tuberalis of the photoperiod (length of day). The expression of this subunit is regulated by the secretion of melatonin in response to light information transmitted to the pineal gland. Earlier studies have shown a localisation of melatonin receptors in this region.|$|E
40|$|The {{pituitary}} gland of Anchoviella lepidentostole {{consists of the}} neurohypophysis and the adenohypophysis, which is subdivided in pars intermedia and <b>pars</b> <b>distalis.</b> The <b>pars</b> <b>distalis</b> comprises <b>pars</b> <b>distalis</b> rostralis and <b>pars</b> <b>distalis</b> proximalis.

40|$|Hypophysis {{morphology}} and the immunocharacteristics of the adenohypophyseal {{cells in}} Anguis fragilis were described by light microscopy using conventional staining methods and an unlabeled antibody enzyme technique. The A. fragilis hypophysis showed a general morphology {{similar to that}} of the other reptiles. The occurrence and distribution of cell types revealed somatotropic cells in the caudal <b>pars</b> <b>distalis</b> only as large cellular cordons. Instead prolactin cells were observed in the rostral <b>pars</b> <b>distalis</b> and in the medial <b>pars</b> <b>distalis</b> where appeared isolated or clustered in small cellular cordons.

40|$|The {{development}} of corticotropes and lactotropes {{was investigated in}} the golden Syrian hamster using an anti-porcine ACTH antiserum and a homologous antihamster PRL antiserum. Oval corticotropes were first visible in the ventral region of the <b>pars</b> <b>distalis</b> at 13 days of gestation. By the end of gestation, corticotropes were found throughout the <b>pars</b> <b>distalis</b> and in the pars intermedia. Corticotropes in the <b>pars</b> <b>distalis</b> of postnatal hamsters were either round or irregularly-shaped, often appearing in clusters. Throughout development, corticotropes often appeared to be surrounding other cells. Scarce, very small lactotropes were first observed in the <b>pars</b> <b>distalis</b> of hamsters on the first postnatal day. The number of these cells, which were either round or polyhedral, increased dramatically between 4 and 20 days of postnatal life. These observations indicate that the sequence of appearance of corticotropes and lactotropes in the hamster {{is similar to that}} in other species and that lactotropes are confined to the <b>pars</b> <b>distalis</b> of postnatal hamsters. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{morphology}} of the hypophysis and the immunocharacteristics of the adenohypophyseal {{cells in}} the viviparous reptile Chalcides chalcides were studied by light microscopy, using conventional staining methods and an indirect antibody technique (ABC method), respectively. The general morphology of the C. chalcides hypophysis was {{comparable to that of}} other reptiles, showing three main regions: the <b>pars</b> <b>distalis,</b> the pars intermedia and the pars nervosa. The gland appeared as an elongated body in a cephalic-caudal direction and was almost completely enclosed in the sella turcica. For this reason, the hypophysis was studied in toto with the brain in decalcified specimens. The <b>pars</b> <b>distalis</b> accounted for most of the whole organ. The pars intermedia surrounded the pars nervosa as a goblet. The pars tuberalis was lacking. The immunohistochemical identification of the adenohypophyseal cells was performed using rabbit antisera against mammalian/ synthetic hypophyseal hormones. Prolactin cells were clustered in small cellular cordons in the rostral <b>pars</b> <b>distalis</b> and in the medial <b>pars</b> <b>distalis</b> in both male and female specimens. Somatotropic cells were found in the caudal <b>pars</b> <b>distalis.</b> Corticotropic cells were observed in the medio-rostral <b>pars</b> <b>distalis,</b> {{as well as in the}} pars intermedia, where melanotropic cells were also present. Melanotropic cells were confined to the pars intermedia. Gonadotropic cells were mostly distributed in the ventral and lateral portions of the <b>pars</b> <b>distalis,</b> where they were found isolated or in small clusters. Thyrotropic cells were detected in the <b>pars</b> <b>distalis</b> with a distribution similar to that of the gonadotropic cells; however, atypically, they were also found in the pars intermedia. Therefore, the cytological characteristics of the adenohypophyseal cells appeared mostly conserved...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{evidence}} for a factor secreted by bovine hypophyseal pars tuberalis that stimulates luteinizing hormone (LH) release from rat <b>pars</b> <b>distalis</b> cells is shown. The secretion products of bovine pars tuberalis cells into the culture medium were assayed on dispersed rat <b>pars</b> <b>distalis</b> cells in 30 min incubations and superfusion experiments. The culture medium from pars tuberalis total cell populations, added at a dose of 6 &# 956;g per tube, induced the greater LH release from <b>pars</b> <b>distalis</b> cells, without effect on follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) release. After pars tuberalis cells separation on a discontinuos Percoll gradient, only the culture medium of cells from 50 and 60 % strength Percoll were able to release LH from rat <b>pars</b> <b>distalis</b> cells. Therefore, cell fractions from 50 and 60 % strenght Percoll were cultured together. To elicit maximal LH release (6 times the basal output), {{with the addition of}} 2 &# 956;g of pars tuberalis protein was required, suggesting that these cells produce the factor or factors which affect <b>pars</b> <b>distalis</b> gonadotrope cells. After applying the pars tuberalis culture medium on 12 % SDS-PAGE, the band with biological activity was that of 66 -kDal.

40|$|The {{secretion}} of prolactin by the <b>pars</b> <b>distalis</b> transplanted {{at a site}} {{remote from}} the hypo-thalamus was first reported by Desclin (1950). This author observed {{the persistence of the}} ovarian corpora lutea in hypophysectomized, oestrogen-treated rats bearing a <b>pars</b> <b>distalis</b> graft under the kidney capsule. Everett (1954, 1956) confirmed Desclin's findings, but in addition demonstrated that liberation of prolactin from the pituitary gland graft occurred independently of oestrogen. Mł=u" & Boot (1959) found that transplanted hypophyses release prolactin continuously.

40|$|POMC {{messenger}} RNA (mRNA) is synthesized {{and translated}} to form ACTH in the <b>pars</b> <b>distalis</b> and ACTH-related peptides in the pars intermedia of the pituitary in fetuses of {{species such as}} sheep. In the fetal sheep, maturation of hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function occurs during late pregnancy accompanied by increased levels of POMC mRNA in the <b>pars</b> <b>distalis,</b> and contributes to the stimulus far birth. Activation of fetal HPA function also occurs with short term hypoxemia. However, the effects of more prolonged fetal hyperemia, which may predispose to premature parturition, on POMC mRNA levels in the <b>pars</b> <b>distalis</b> and pars intermedia are not known. We studied the effects of sustained hypoxemia (48 h) {{in the absence of}} acidosis on fetal HPA responses at two times in late gestation, days 126 - 130 and days 134 - 136 (term = similar to 145 days). Hypoxemia was induced by lowering the fraction of oxygen in the maternal inspired gas mixture. Fetal arterial oxygen tension fell by 6 - 8 mm Hg, without a change in fetal arterial pH or carbon dioxide tension. Pituitary POMC mRNA was localized and quantified by in situ hybridization. At both gestational ages, hypoxemia caused a transient elevation in fetal plasma ACTH, with a maximum response at + 2 h, and a sustained elevation in circulating cortisol. Cortisol responses were greater in the older fetuses. Changes in plasma cortisol were not associated with alterations in the plasma corticosteroid-binding capacity or in levels of hepatic corticosteroid-binding globulin mRNA. Pituitary POMC mRNA showed a regional distribution in the <b>pars</b> <b>distalis,</b> and mean levels increased with gestational age. After 48 h of hypoxemia, POMC mRNA levels had increased in the <b>pars</b> <b>distalis.</b> The regional distribution was unaffected by the hypoxemic insult. In contrast, POMC mRNA levels in the pars intermedia decreased after hypoxemia, and the reduction was greater in the older fetuses. We conclude that in response to prolonged hypoxemia, there is differential regulation of POMC mRNA levels in the <b>pars</b> <b>distalis</b> and pars intermedia of the pituitary in fetal sheep. The magnitude of these responses also changes with gestational age. The increase in POMC mRNA levels in the <b>pars</b> <b>distalis</b> at 48 h of hypoxemia, despite a rise in plasma cortisol and without a change in corticosteroid-binding globulin, suggests altered regulation of HPA function at this time...|$|E
40|$|The {{possible}} {{effect of}} proopiomelanocortin-derived peptide, beta-endorphin on frog gonadotrope cells was investigated. Binding and internalization of beta-endorphin to pituitary <b>pars</b> <b>distalis</b> cultured cells were visualized by immunofluorescence and analyzed {{by means of}} confocal laser scanning microscopy. Using biotinylated endorphin, the time-course of beta-binding showed that this opioid was internalized through receptor-mediated endocytosis, the mechanism in which actin and clathrin were involved; then, the lysosomal degradation program occurred at later stages. The beta-endorphin binding was well antagonized by Naloxone, the opiate receptor antagonist, and up-regulated since more rapid response was obtained in the previously primed cells. The double immunostaining reaction for beta-endorphin and LH beta-subunit revealed that half the beta-endorphin labeled cell population was positively immunostained for LH beta-subunit, and beta-endorphin was able to induce an increasing trend of LH secretion in cultured <b>pars</b> <b>distalis</b> cells.

40|$|AbstractThe {{anterior}} {{pituitary gland}} (adenohypophysis) comprises anterior and intermediate lobes (the <b>pars</b> <b>distalis</b> and pars intermedia) arising from placodal ectoderm at the anterior neural ridge. Signaling molecules including SHH, FGF, WNT, BMP and Notch {{are involved in}} regulating primordial pituitary proliferation and lineage determination. However, morphogenic events and molecular mechanisms governing anterior and intermediate lobe specification are not clear. Pituitary expression of proopiomelanocortin (POMC), the common precursor for adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) of <b>pars</b> <b>distalis</b> corticotropes and α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) of pars intermedia melanotropes, provides a unique marker for anterior and intermediate lobe morphogenesis. We performed time-lapse confocal microscopy lineage tracing in live zebrafish embryos expressing GFP driven by the pomc promoter and show distinct migration pathways of POMC cells destined to the anterior and intermediate lobes. Using morpholino oligonucleotides, we show that hypomorphic FGF 3 down-regulation induces specific defects of pars intermedia POMC cells while pomc, growth hormone and prolactin expression remain intact in the <b>pars</b> <b>distalis.</b> This lineage-specific process is independent of the FGF 3 effect on early pituitary specifying transcription factors as indicated by normal Lim 3 and Pit 1 expression in hypomorphic FGF 3 morphants. These {{findings suggest that the}} FGF 3 signal, in addition to its previously described role of regulating progenitor proliferation and survival, delineates the melanotrope and corticotrope lineage boundary, contributing to establishment of the pituitary <b>pars</b> <b>distalis</b> and pars intermedia...|$|E
40|$|Syrian hamsters {{exhibit a}} marked {{seasonal}} variation in prolactin secretion. The {{aim of this}} study was to analyse the nature of the photoperiodic regulation of prolactin gene expression, and to define the role of melatonin and the pars tuberalis of the anterior pituitary in this process. Pituitary prolactin gene expression, restricted to the <b>pars</b> <b>distalis,</b> was increased in hamsters maintained in long daylengths (16 h : 8 h, light : dark) compared to hamsters exposed to short daylengths (8 h : 16 h, light : dark) for 8 – 12 weeks. Analysis of single cells by in situ hybridization showed that photoperiod had no effect on the percentage of <b>pars</b> <b>distalis</b> cells expressing prolactin mRNA, but shifted the frequency distribution of prolactin mRNA expression per cell, such that in long photoperiods a greater proportion of cells were recruited to a higher expressing population. In vitro coculture of hamster pars tuberalis fragments increased prolactin promoter-driven luciferase activity in stably transfected GH 3 cells in a dose- and duration-dependent manner. Conditioned medium from hamster and ovine pars tuberalis also activated the prolactin promoter. Furthermore, basal and forskolin-stimulated conditioned medium from hamster pars tuberalis increased prolactin mRNA expression in primary cultures of <b>pars</b> <b>distalis</b> cells. Melatonin attenuated the activity of pars tuberalis-conditioned medium but had no direct effect on either prolactin mRNA expression or secretion in <b>pars</b> <b>distalis</b> cell cultures. Finally, pars tuberalis fragments from long photoperiod hamsters stimulated prolactin gene promoter activity to a greater extent than those from short photoperiod hamsters. In conclusion, this study provides the first evidence in a seasonal mammal that the synthesis of prolactin depends on photoperiodic modulation of a pars tuberalis-derived factor. Our data support further the hypothesis that seasonal modulation of prolactin gene expression depends upon a melatonin-dependent paracrine action of the pars tuberalis on <b>pars</b> <b>distalis</b> lactotrophic cells...|$|E
