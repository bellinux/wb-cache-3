40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{development}} of secondary optics for concentrator photovoltaic (CPV) modules. It focuses on reflective secondary optics designed for high concentration modules using fresnel lenses as the <b>primary</b> concentrating <b>optics.</b> The development of the secondary optics was guided by the idea of designing an optical element suitable for cost effective mass production. The <b>primary</b> concentrating <b>optics</b> of a CPV module can direct only a limited part of the solar aureole (the immediate surroundings of the sun) onto the solar cell. The same applies to light impinging non-perpendicular to the optical axis of the module (e. g., due to misalignment of the module). Therefore, one of the main functions of reflective secondary optics is to redirect light onto the solar cell that would otherwise not reach it. In order to analyze the performance of secondary optical elements ("secondaries"), a measurement setup is introduced that measures the angular photocurrent response of a CPV device with highly parallel light. This response {{is referred to as the}} "angular acceptance function" (AAF). The AAF is used to estimate the performance of the CPV device under various conditions with differing circumsolar radiation (CSR). A CPV test module was manufactured featuring III-V triple-junction solar cells, a fresnel lens panel as the primary concentrator optic, and the newly developed reflective secondary. The results of a 6 -month outdoor measurement period are presented and compared to the performance of a reference module as well as to the results of the indoor AAF measurements...|$|R

40|$|This {{architecture}} {{features an}} active wavefront sensing and control scheme along with methods {{for measuring the}} relative positions of the <b>primary</b> to aft <b>optics,</b> such as the secondary mirror, and should enable larger and cheaper telescope architectures needed for future applications. A wavefront source/sensor is placed {{at the center of}} curvature of the primary mirror. The system provides continuous light onto a primary mirror that is retro-reflected onto itself. This allows the wavefront controller to constantly update the positions of the primary mirror segments (or deformable mirror actuators). Another function of this innovation involves using a concave mirror {{on the back of the}} secondary mirror (or other aft optic) that has the same center-of-curvature location (in defocus) as the primary mirror. The two return beams can be aligned next to each other on a detector, or radially on top of each other. This provides a means with which to measure the relative position of the primary to the secondary (or other aft optics), thus allowing for the removal of misalignment of the center-of-curvature source/sensor (meaning it doesn't need precision placement) and also provides a means with which to monitor the relative alignment over time. This innovation does not require extremely good thermal stability on the primary mirror and can thus be used in any thermal environment and with cheaper materials. In addition to this, the architecture lets one phase (or align) the primary mirror independent of whether a star or scene is in the field. The segmented, spherical primary allows for cost-effective three-meter class (e. g. Midex and Discovery) missions as well as enabling 30 -meter telescope solutions that can be manufactured in a reasonable amount of time. The continuous wavefront sensing and control architecture enables missions for low-Earth-orbit...|$|R
