50|$|The Garranone {{site was}} managed as an oak (Quercus petraea) coppice {{since at least}} the 16th century. In the mid-19th century the wood was {{converted}} from coppice to free-standing trees (employing Continental techniques) when Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) was planted between the coppices. Each coppice was singled to one bole and these were forced upwards by the quick-growing pines. Also included with the pines are a number of sweet chestnuts and other trees. The original management to convert the coppice would have involved cutting down the non-native trees once the oak were sizable and growing straight upwards. However, this was done in a desultory way, and many pines and other trees survive. This management was revealed by <b>palynological</b> <b>study,</b> and supported by a forester's handbook now in the keeping of the National Library of Ireland. This management is unique in Irish woodland history.|$|E
