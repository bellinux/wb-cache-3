The inquiry documented the decades-long chain of events that finally lead to Toft’s conviction, showing that various reports to Fredericton City police, the RCMP, the Daily Gleaner, the CBC, the Attorney General, and Cabinet Ministers failed to lead to disciplinary action against Toft and other institution staff. An investigation of Forbes’ claims of sexual abuse led to a report by the Executive Director of Policing Services, Hugh Robichaud, condemning the actions of Forbes for not following proper channels. The Miller Inquiry was not specifically mandated to investigate systemic abuse, prompting some to remark that the victims have not yet received justice and closure.|$|R

This study found the statistically significant impacts of the medical travelers’ three dimensional perceptions on medical tourism brand choice. In specific, this research contributes the theory development as the confirmation for the aspects that the medical travelers would select the medical/ health service provider (s) by the perceived congruence between demand and supply of medical facilities, the perceived quality for the congruence of demand and supply of medical facilities, and the image of destination brand in terms of <b>prompted</b> hospitality <b>facilities.</b> Market practitioners can employ the research results to adjust the market strategies and programs, especially for developing and improving the medical travelers’ perceptions toward hospitals and/or doctors, and especially for the country image of Thailand. Similarly, the policy makers or relevant government agents should be concerned the importance of the perceptions of medical travelers’ on the positive congruence and quality of demand and supply in terms of medical facilities, and Thailand's brand image. Although the quantitative method could not provide the tests of moderating impacts of ‘Agency's Roles’, ‘Roles of Internet/ Online Contact’, and ‘Perceived Consistence of Health Insurance System’, the exploratory qualitative data present the important implications for these variables. Contemporary medical tourism markets, the medical travelers search information or contact the medical service providers through internet/ online. The medical tourism agency is important for the medical travelers. Taking the medical tourism services away from hometown, the medical tourism agents can facilitate the travelers to search destinations; country, hospital, and doctors. The roles of insurance system on the destination selection, especially for the Western medical travelers, are important. Moreover, from the exploratory data, a customer's ‘Brand Trust’ toward the country or hospital destination can be a suspected mediating construct of the examined relationships between the three dimensional perceptions and destination brand choice. This mediating construct's roles should be investigated in the further study...|$|R

Relocation took place in August, 1990. The first ward had two six-bedded bays, each single-sex. The second ward was a Nightingale-type ward where male and female patients were mixed. The nurses tried to avoid men and women being in beds directly opposite to each other.

50|$|In August 1941, {{the wartime}} {{emergency}} <b>prompted</b> the minting <b>facilities</b> {{to be evacuated}} from the Neva district in Moscow and relocated to Permskaya Oblast as German forces continued to advance Eastward. It only became possible to resume coin production {{in the autumn of}} 1942, for one year the country was using coins made before the war. Furthermore, the coins were made of what had suddenly become precious metals - copper and nickel, which were needed for the defense industry. This meant many coins were being produced in only limited quantities, with some denominations being skipped altogether until the crisis finally abated in late 1944. These disruptions led to severe coin shortages in many regions. Limits were put in place on how much change could be carried in coins with limits of 3 rubles for individuals and 10 rubles for vendors to prevent hoarding as coins became increasingly high in demand. Only high inflation and wartime rationing helped ease pressure significantly. In some instances, postage stamps and coupons were being used in the place of small denomination coins. It was not until 1947 that there were finally enough coins in circulation to meet economic demand and the restrictions could be eased.|$|R

Siwabessy also began developing the concept of puskesmas, a community health centr that would become prominent in Indonesia's rural regions. Between 22 and 29 April 1968, Siwabessy held the Rapat Kerja Kesehatan Nasional (English: National Healthcare Meeting) that yielded designs for Repelita (Indonesian: Rencana Pembangunan Lima Tahun; English: Five-Year Development Plan) that was to be first applied to healthcare in Indonesia. Siwabessy commissioned the creation of a special planning committee led by Sulianti Saroso and created education programs at the National Health Institute in Surabaya and at the Health Development Agency in Jakarta to train people to plan in the context of applying development to solve healthcare issues. He arranged for employees of the Ministry of Health and local governments to study abroad. One month after the health conference, Suharto replaced the Sukarno-era Ampera Cabinet with the Development Cabinet. G.A. Siwabessy was reappointed Minister of Health in the first of Suharto's cabinets. Before the events associated with Repelita I ended, Suharto was re-elected as president in 1972.

40|$|A b s t r a c t Sterilizing {{irradiation}} of the US mail {{has been}} proposed as a method to prevent delivery of viable anthrax spores. Because newborn screening samples (bloodspots) and cyclosporine and tacrolimus specimens (whole blood) are delivered routinely through the mail, we studied whether sterilizing gamma irradiation could affect these test results. Specimens were exposed to 18 kGy gamma irradiation (100 hours × 18, 000 rad/h), a “kill dose ” for Bacillus pumilus spore strips. Irradiation had no significant effect on whole blood cyclosporine or tacrolimus results, {{but it had a}} degradative effect on bloodspot phenylalanine, hemoglobins, biotinidase, galactose- 1 -phosphate uridyltransferase, thyroxine, and thyrotropin. Such irradiation potentially could cause false-negative results for the detection of phenylketonuria and likely would lead to an increase in secondary testing for hemoglobin variants, but it is unlikely to lead to false-negative or false-positive results for the remaining newborn screening tests. These experiments cannot rule out possible greater effects by larger doses or other types of irradiation.
