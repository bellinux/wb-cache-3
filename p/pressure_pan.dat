50|$|A third {{test method}} to {{determine}} if ductwork is leaking to the outside {{is to use a}} <b>pressure</b> <b>pan,</b> which is a register cover with a pressure tap for a hose connection. With the house pressurized (or depressurized) to 50 Pa (-50 Pa) using a blower door, a pressure gauge is attached to the <b>pressure</b> <b>pan</b> by means of a hose. If the pressure difference is near zero, this indicates that the ductwork associated with that particular register is not connected to the outside. A pressure 5 Pa or above indicates that the duct work is connected to or leaking to the outside. A smaller pressure difference indicates greater leakage. This method does not quantify duct leakage, but serves to identify locations of ductwork runs that are leaking to the outside. It is more of a qualitative measure, used for fault isolation.|$|E

Conventional Grocott stain employs environmentally harsh 5 % chromic acid for oxidization.

40|$|This {{experimental}} study focuses on combustion of liquid fuel droplets subject to external acoustic disturbances {{in the form}} of standing waves within an acoustic waveguide. Acoustic perturbations create a mean flame deflection dependent on the droplet location relative to the pressure node (PN) or <b>pressure</b> antinode (<b>PAN)</b> in the waveguide. This flame deflection is consistent with the sign of a theoretical acoustic acceleration acting on the burning system. Yet experimentally derived acoustic accelerations estimated from the degree of flame deflection differ quantitatively from that predicted by the acoustic radiation force theory. Phase locked OH* chemiluminescence imaging reveals a deflected flame which oscillates in position relative to the stationary droplet. Flame luminosity fluctuates with pressure throughout the forcing period, indicating the flame heat release rate is influenced by acoustic excitation. The thermoacoustic instability fostered by the in-phase oscillation of pressure and heat release rate is quantified via the Rayleigh index. Evaluation of the Rayleigh index over a range of acoustic forcing frequencies and droplet locations exposes the frequency sensitive character of the combustion mechanism stemming from dissimilar acoustic and chemical kinetic time scales. The present experimental configuration provides a useful test bed for evaluating the response of different alternative and conventional fuels to an acoustically resonant environment {{in the context of the}} well-known Rayleigh criterion...|$|R

This calculation of the worst case error is equivalent to an Euler-Bernoulli beam problem in one-dimension and the Kirchhoff-Love plate problem in two-dimensions, thus connecting the velocity-based pressure calculation, to elastic dynamics. These results can be used to minimize experimental error by avoiding worst case scenarios and to design synthetic velocity errors for future PIV-pressure challenges...|$|R

40|$|Assessing soil {{structure}} is primordial when comparing tillage systems. Whilst most conventional techniques characterize global parameters, X-ray microtomography allows a {{characterization of the}} poral space at a µm-scale. These results, combined with data from pF curves, can form a solid basis in order to quantify soil physical fertility. Soil samples {{were taken from the}} organic topsoil on two Belgian experimental sites implementing both conventional tillage (CT, ploughing) and simplified tillage (ST, superficial works), without straw restitution: Gentinnes, Brabant Wallon (March 2010), and Gembloux, Namur (November 2010). On the Gentinnes site (Aba(b) 1), CT and ST have been implemented since October 2005, with a beet/winter wheat rotation. On the Gembloux site (Aba(b)), CT and ST have been implemented since September 2008, with a winter wheat cultivation since end 2009. Tomography (10 samples for Gentinnes, 8 for Gembloux) and pF curves (10 samples for Gentinnes, 14 for Gembloux) were used for analysis. <b>Pressure</b> <b>pans</b> were used in order to obtain the pF curves on 100 cm³ undisturbed samples. Soil cores (3 cm diameter, 5 cm height) were scanned using a Skyscan- 1172 µ-CT device. The conical beam, operating at 100 kV, produced images having a 17 µm pixel size, using a 16 -bit 1048 × 2000 pixels camera equipped with an aluminium filter. The raw images were then treated under Matlab® for binarization, using a thresholding loop to fit the measured and the calculated porosity of each sample (Beckers et al, 2011). The 2 D binary images were then analyzed under Matlab® and Skyscan™ CT-analyzer. On the site of Gentinnes, pF analysis showed a greater available water content (between pF 4. 2 and 2. 5) for ST, and a greater efficient porosity (between saturation and pF 2. 5) for CT. The differences in available water content, although not significant, were confirmed by site observation. Tomography analysis yielded the following: under ST, the pores are smaller and the anisotropy less developed. As for the poral connectivity, it was found greater in CT. On the site of Gembloux, however, {{no significant differences were found}} between the tillage systems concerning the pF curves. Tomography analysis showed smaller pores for simplified tillage, but the differences deduced by the tomographic analysis of the Gentinnes samples concerning connectivity and anisotropy were not found in this case. To conclude, from the results, the {{soil structure}} is found to differ between CT and ST. The pores tend to be smaller and less oriented in ST, whilst in CT pores are more connected. Soils undergoing a CT show a greater efficient porosity, whilst soils under ST display a greater available water content. However, these differences were mostly spotted on the Gentinnes site: in Gembloux, the differences between the samples were less marked. This could be due to the fact that the soil did not have time to differentiate yet (less than 3 years of tillage differentiation). More sampling is needed in any case before inferring general conclusions from these observations. A further analysis of the soil images, especially concerning pore orientation, will be done in order to fully exploit the tomography results...|$|R

40|$|The {{particular}} interest in VH antibody fragments {{stems from the fact}} that they can rival their "naturally occurring" single-domain antibody (sdAb) counterparts (camelid VHHs and shark VNARs) with regard to such desirable characteristics as stability, solubility, expression, and ability to penetrate cryptic epitopes and outperform them in terms of less immunogenicity, a much valued property in human immunotherapy applications. However, human VHs are typically prone to aggregation. Various approaches for developing non-aggregating human VHs with binding specificities have relied on a combination of recombinant DNA technology and phage-display technology. VH gene libraries are constructed synthetically by randomizing the CDRs of a single VH scaffold fused to a gene encoding a phage coat protein. Recombinant phage expressing the resulting VH libraries in fusion with the pIII protein is propagated in Escherichia coli. Monoclonal phage displaying VHs with specificities for target antigens are isolated from the libraries by a process called panning. The exertion of stability pressure in addition to binding <b>pressure</b> during <b>panning</b> ensures that the isolated VH binders are also non-aggregating. The genes encoding the desired VHs selected from the libraries are packaged within the phage particles, linking genotype and phenotype, hence making possible the identification of the selected VHs through identifying its physically linked genotype.

Pan Am's takeover of Modern Air's Saarbrücken route in February 1972, which entailed serving it from the former's base at the rival Tempelhof Airport with 128-seat Boeing 727-100s, was followed by the airline's unexpected suspension of Tempelhof-Saarbrücken services after less than a year's operation, citing insufficient demand. This turn of events resulted in Modern Air applying for permission to re-enter the Berlin-Saarbrücken scheduled market with two daily return flights using CV-990s. Permission for Modern Air to resume its Tegel-Saarbrücken route was granted in time for a summer 1973 re-launch.

50|$|Modern Air's {{management}} {{sought to}} counteract the advantages British competitors enjoyed in the West Berlin charter market by partnering long-standing business partner Berliner Flugring in launching the city's first regular, all year round long-haul charter flight programme. It was thought that, in addition to picking {{up some of the}} lucrative contracts for an extensive short-/medium-haul West Berlin charter flight programme from Tegel Airport a consortium of three West German tour operators had awarded to defunct British rival Channel Airways in September 1970 (beginning in March 1971), this would provide sufficient utilisation for the airline's additional Berlin-based aircraft and enable it to obtain better rates than in the city's heavily contested short-/medium-haul charter market. This in turn would allow Berliner Flugring to further differentiate itself from rivals and enable it to charge its customers a premium for a new, unique and superior product. However, this was dependent on regulatory approval by the Allied Air Attachés in Bonn and the aviation authorities of destination countries. However, as a result of <b>pressure</b> exerted by <b>Pan</b> Am, British European Airways (BEA) and Air France on the Allied Air Attachés, as well as objections lodged by the destination countries' national airlines with their aviation authorities, the relevant approvals were withheld. The established airlines viewed Modern Air's plans as a backdoor route to the scheduled air market. They feared that granting permission to a non-member of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) outside the relevant intergovernmental, bilateral air transport agreements would set a precedent for other non-IATA members to bypass regulatory restrictions in contemporary bilateral air transport agreements that limited access to scheduled air services and encourage circumvention of IATA fare rules by non-members.|$|R

In many cases the process steam consumption has been reduced from greater than 52 % on cane to ~ 40 % on cane. The main changes have been to install additional evaporation area {{at the front of}} the set, operate the pan stages on vapour from No 1 or No 2 effects and undertake juice heating using vapour bleed from evaporators as far down the set as the penultimate stage. Operationally, one of the main challenges has been to develop a control system for the evaporators that addresses the objectives of juice processing rate (throughput) and steam economy, while producing syrup consistently at the required brix and providing an adequate and consistent vapour <b>pressure</b> for the <b>pan</b> stage operations. The cyclic demand for vapour by batch pans causes process disturbances through the evaporator set and these must be regulated in an effective manner to satisfy the above list of objectives for the evaporator station.

However, few researches related to the season-long microclimatic changes under sprinkler irrigation in this region. A field experiment was carried out to investigate the long-time effect of sprinkler irrigation on microclimate in a winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) field and compare the microclimate under both sprinkler and surface irrigation conditions from April 2001 to June 2003 in two experimental stations in the North China Plain. Results showed that air temperature, air temperature gradient from 1 to 2 in above ground surface and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) were significant lower (P < 0. 05) in the sprinkler-irrigated field with respect to those in surface irrigation field after the first sprinkler irrigation during three winter wheat seasons. The maximum reduction in air temperature and VPD in the sprinkler-irrigated field in comparison with the surface irrigated field occurred on sprinkler irrigation days. During daytime (between 08 : 00 and 20 : 00 h), air temperature and VPD were significantly affected by sprinkler irrigation respected to night-time (between 20 : 00 and 08 : 00 h) at sprinkler irrigation intervals.

40|$|BackgroundLow {{molecular}} weight haptens (< 1000 Da) cannot {{be recognized by}} the immune system unless conjugated to larger carrier molecules. Antibodies to these exceptionally small antigens can still be generated with exquisite sensitivity. A detailed understanding {{at the molecular level}} of this incredible ability of antibodies to recognize haptens, is still limited compared to other antigen classes. MethodsDifferent hapten targets with a broad range of structural flexibility and polarity were conjugated to carrier proteins, and utilized in sheep immunization. Three antibody libraries were constructed and used as potential pools to isolate specific antibodies to each target. The isolated antibodies were analysed in term of CDR length, canonical structure, and binding site shape and electrostatic potential. ResultsThe simple, chemically naïve structure of squalane (SQA) was recognized with micromolar sensitivity. An increase in structural rigidity of the hydrophobic and cyclic coprostane (COP) did not improve this binding sensitivity beyond the micromolar range, whilst the polar etioporphyrin (POR) was detected with nanomolar sensitivity. Homoserine lactone (HSL) molecules, which combine molecular flexibility and polarity, generated super-sensitive (picomolar) interactions. To better understand this range of antibody-hapten interactions, analyses were extended to examine the binding loop canonical structures and CDR lengths of a series of anti-hapten clones. Analyses of the pre and post- selection (panning of the phage displayed libraries) sequences revealed more conserved sites (123) within the post-selection sequences, when compared to their pre-selection counterparts (28). The strong selection <b>pressure,</b> generated by <b>panning</b> against these haptens resulted in the isolation of antibodies with significant sequence conservation in the FW regions, and suitable binding site cavities, representing only a relatively small subset of the available full repertoire sequence and structural diversity. As part of this process, the important influence of CDR H 2 on antigen binding was observed through its direct interaction with individual antigens and indirect impact on the orientation and the pocket shape, when combined with CDRs H 3 and L 3. The binding pockets also displayed electrostatic surfaces that were complementary to the hydrophobic nature of COP, SQA, and POR, and the negatively charged HSL. ConclusionsThe best binding antibodies have shown improved capacity to recognize these haptens by establishing complementary binding pockets in terms of size, shape, and electrostatic potential...|$|R
40|$|Fabrication and {{synthesis}} of nanostructured materials are essential aspects of nanoscience and nanotechnology. Although researchers are {{now able to}} create and tailor different nanostructured materials, the ability to precisely control the materials' sizes, shapes, and properties at the nanoscale level remains challenging. The aim of this dissertation was to develop new methods to aid researchers in overcoming these challenges. The study investigated two different methods used to create one-dimensional carbon nanostructures, i. e. carbon nanotubes and carbon nanopillars. In the first section, chemical vapor deposition method was used to grow carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Studies examining the effects of methane and hydrogen flow rates on the growth of CNTs were conducted. Results indicated that multi-walled CNTs with metallic properties could be obtained at a methane flow rates as low as 300 cc/min. At higher methane flow rates, i. e. 600 - 700 cc/min, semiconducting single-walled CNTs and double-walled CNTs were produced. Another phase of this section developed a new and simple CNT growth method using a solid carbon source and indicated polyacrylonitrile and nanosized SiO₂ were effective in producing MWCNTs. In the second part, a new nanoimprint technique was developed to enable printing of nanostructures at sub- 100 nm level using various polymers. This technique inherited its high-resolution feature from traditional nanoimprint lithography, but without the use of <b>pressure.</b> To demonstrate, <b>PAN</b> nanopillar structures were printed and converted to carbon. In another phase of the part, the use of our imprint technique resulted in the creation and conversion of polysilazane nanostructures to ceramic for the first time.

In one study, a new technique using SEM images to determine GDL porosity was developed. The difference between SEM calculated porosities and mercury intrusion porosimetry measurements were less than 2 %. The second study characterized fuel cell performances using GDLs constructed with additional micro porous layers (MPLs) and treated with different wet proofing treatments (WPT).

On 27 February a Paraguayan army foot patrol and its native guides were taken prisoners near the Pilcomayo River and held in the Bolivian outpost of Fortin Sorpresa, where {{the commander of the}} Paraguayan platoon, lieutenant Adolfo Rojas Silva, was shot and killed in suspicious circumstances. Fortín (Spanish for [...] "little fort") was the name used for the small pillbox and trench-like garrisons in the Chaco, although the troops' barracks usually were {{no more than a few}} mud huts. While the Bolivian government formally regretted the death of Rojas Silva, the Paraguayan public opinion called it [...] "murder". After the subsequent talks arranged in Buenos Aires failed to produce any agreement and eventually collapsed in January 1928, the dispute grew violent. On 5 December 1928 a Paraguayan cavalry unit overran Fortin Vanguardia, an advance outpost established by the Bolivian army a few miles northwest of Bahía Negra. The Paraguayans captured 21 Bolivian soldiers and burnt the scattered huts to the ground.The Bolivians retaliated with an air strike on Bahía Negra on 15 December, which caused few casualties and not much damage. On 14 December Bolivia seized Fortin Boquerón, which later would be the site of the first major battle of the campaign, at the cost of 15 Paraguayan dead. A return to the status quo ante was eventually agreed on 12 September 1929 in Washington, under <b>pressure</b> from the <b>Pan</b> American League, but an arms race had already begun and both countries were on a collision course. The regular border clashes might have led to war in the 1920s if either side was capable of waging war against one another. As it was, neither Paraguay or Bolivia had an arms industry and both sides had to import vast quantities of arms from Europe and the United States to arm themselves for the coming conflict. It was the need for both sides to import sufficient arms that held back the outbreak of the war to 1932, at which point both sides felt capable of resorting to arms to settle the long-running dispute.|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The focus of this thesis is the area of staling of Arabic flat bread (or pita bread). The reductions in shelf life due to bread staling cause significant economic losses in the Middle East where preservatives are not permitted. The aim was to investigate whether processing solutions could solve this problem. A commercial bread produced in Kuwait was initially studied. The industrial baking process was monitored closely, and the products analyzed for moisture content in Kuwait after storage at 4 and 20 °C. Representative samples were ground and freezedried in Kuwait, and transported to the UK for analysis by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The {{findings from this study}} showed moisture content variations between different bread formulations after baking, however the DSC analysis was inconclusive due to possible changes in the freeze dried bread. The industrial process was thus replicated as closely as possible at Loughborough University so that the bread could be analysed immediately after baking and after up to 3 days storage. It was also found that high <b>pressure</b> stainless steel <b>pans</b> produced better DSC baseline stability compared to aluminium pans due to suspected leakage of the latter (used in literature studies), and were thus used {{for the rest of the}} study. Attention was also paid to the possibility that different parts of the bread receive different radiant heating intensities during baking as evidenced by the different degrees of brown coloration. This showed that whilst almost complete gelatinisation initially occurs, the highest levels of subsequent retrogradation occurred in an area intermediate between the centre and outside of the pita bread. This coincided with the region with the highest moisture content immediately after processing (and likely to receive the least amount of heat). A parallel study using DSC which subjected dough samples to a temperature profile similar to that found in baking also found that lower heating rates (with albeit higher heat exposure) produced greater amounts of retrogradation. In each case moisture contents during storage were comparable between samples, thus indicating that heating rates during processing is a key parameter governing subsequent retrogradation, and also that future studies should identify the sampling position within the bread when performing analyses. Thermocouple studies showed that the temperatures in the steam pocket that develops during puffing were close to that of the boiling point of water. Consequently, a further study was also performed in which Arabic flat bread samples were baked at different pressures (up to 2 bar) in a novel high pressure oven. The motivation was that changing pressure to increase baking temperatures could be a way of using processing rather than formulation methods to extend shelf life. Whilst applying pressure was found to retard subsequent retrogradation, it did result in breads becoming firmer during storage which was not the desired effect. However, this may be a consequence of the slightly lower moisture contents found in the bread baked at higher pressure...|$|R
40|$|Freeze {{pre-concentration}} system, FPCS, {{with low}} lift reversible heat pump {{is designed for}} selective freezing of water from sugarcane juice. Â Two identical vented double wall tube-and-tube heat exchangers are used, to freeze water in the evaporator and melt ice in the condenser, alternately. Â They are sized based on cooling capacity offered by compressor, ice growth rate and velocity of juice inside the tube to reduce inclusion. Â Low lift heat pump is designed to operate at - 8 oC evaporator and 3 oC condenser saturation temperatures. Â Since, the condenser duty is higher than evaporator duty excess heat duty, {{in the form of}} superheat is utilized to heat pre-concentrated juice. Â Raw juice is precooled in a three stream Tube-and-Tube Heat Exchanger, TT_HE. Â Raw juice is precooled using cool concentrated juice and separated water. Â Freeze pre-concentration of sugarcane juice from 20 Â°Brix to 40 Â°Brix using a low lift reversible heat pump saves bagasse during initial 63 % water removal. Â Water is removed through the freezing process requires 335 kJ/kg heat removal, which is equivalent to 15 % of heat addition during evaporation at atmospheric <b>pressure</b> in open <b>pan</b> in jaggery making. Â Investigations on selection of refrigerant R 744, R 290 and R 22 for FPCS are presented. Â R 290 is identified as preferred refrigerant. Â It is natural refrigerant, no ODP and significantly lower operating pressures compared to R 744. Â R 290 charge of 360 g for 1. 5 TR compressor based system is managed by using small diameter refrigerant side tubes. Â It address safety related issues for modular small capacity systems. Â Superheat temperature of compressed refrigerant is 9 oC for R 290. Â It allows to size the identical LHEs with R 290 as a refrigerant. Â Flashing of refrigerant in evaporator is 7 % for R 290 and 10 % R 744. Â Generally, R 744 is preferred when high temperature heating is required. Â But, high superheat at compressor outlet and increased flashing at evaporator inlet reduces the performance of R 744 system making it less preferred as compared to R 290 and R 22. Â Theoretical cycle COPc calculated for R 290 based reversible heat pump works out to be 20, with compressor isentropic efficiency of 70 %. Â Overall system COPc is in the range of 10 to 13 after accounting for losses like cycling of thermal mass, heat gain from ambient, variation in freezing point depression and ice layer thickness.

40|$|The 2 ̆ 2 Knuckle-walking Hominin Hypothesis 2 ̆ 2 postulates {{that there}} was a knuckle-walking phase during the {{transition}} from quadrupedalism to bipedalism. To address this question, previous research has focused on the search for a 2 ̆ 2 signal 2 ̆ 2 within the wrist, and metacarpals of extant knuckle walkers {{that can be used to}} infer this locomotor pattern in extinct hominins. To date, the examined features have not yielded a clear, non-contested signal. I explore the Knuckle-walking Hominin Hypothesis in two ways: 1. by examining the hand postures and the manual <b>pressure</b> application of <b>Pan</b> and Gorilla during knuckle walking to determine whether there are species specific differences and 2. by examining the internal and external morphology of the manual phalanges in an attempt to isolate a clear 2 ̆ 2 knuckle-walking signal 2 ̆ 2. Chimpanzees are more variable in their preferred contact digits, and use both hand positions with equal frequency (2 ̆ 2 palm-in 2 ̆ 2 - palm facing toward the body and 2 ̆ 2 palm-back 2 ̆ 2 - palm facing posteriorly). In contrast, gorillas consistently make contact with all four digits 2 - 5, maintain a pronated arm, and use the palm-back hand position. In both taxa, hand position affects which digit acts as the final touch-off element and therefore receives maximum pressure in a given step, and digit 5 receives significantly less pressure than the other rays. Gorillas are, in effect, practicing a refined subset of the variety of knuckle-walking postures used by the more arboreal chimpanzees. ^ A clear knuckle-walking signal is seen in both the external and internal morphology of the phalanges. Chimpanzees and gorillas have the same middle phalangeal curvature profile with the greatest curvature found in digit 5 (5 3 ̆e 2 3 ̆e 3 3 ̆e 4), the element that receives the least amount of pressure. This phalangeal curvature profile is a feature not shared with any of the included taxa practicing different modes of locomotion. They also have similar Indices of Relative Curvature (IRC-middle phalangeal curvature/proximal phalangeal curvature) for digits 2 - 5 that clearly delineate them with 2 ̆ 2 flatter 2 ̆ 2 middle phalanges and more curved proximal phalanges (IRCs = 0. 85), from quadrupeds with more curved middle than proximal phalanges (IRCs 3 ̆e 1), and suspensory primates with higher and more equal curvature values for both elements (IRCs = 1). This ability to differentiate between locomotor groups holds if the IRCs are composed of elements from different rays of the same manus and from elements of different individuals. Within the trabecular bone structure, knuckle walkers are differentiated from quadrupeds and suspsensory primates in 3 locations: the metacarpal head, and the proximal ends of the middle and proximal phalanges. In particular, the metacarpal head shows distinct differences between the groups: knuckle walkers have a palmar-dorsal alignment of trabeculae and disc-like shape, suspensory taxa have a proximodistal alignment and rod-like shape and quadrupeds have a proximodistal alignment and disc-like shape. The ability to differentiate between locomotor categories using isolated zones increases the applicability of these signals to a fragmentary and limited fossil record. The morphological similarities, specifically the shared curvature profile, and the similar knuckle-walking kinematics employed by chimpanzees and gorillas point to a shared origin of knuckle walking. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Prolonged sitting {{while working}} in an office has become a {{standard}} function in our society. While seated postures do conserve energy and permit a worker {{to focus on a}} task, the posture also involves a significant amount of spine flexion. Held for a prolonged period of time, this non-neutral posture has the potential to generate low back pain through the loading, strain and compression tissues of the low back and buttocks. Indeed, literature points to an association between prolonged occupational sitting and back pain: an expensive problem in terms of direct and indirect health care costs. Two factors involved in this problem, the flexed posture of the low back and the prolonged constrained nature of sitting, could be manipulated in order to reduce their respective contributions to pain and injury pathways. Specifically, decreasing low back flexion could be achieved with various office chair design features and the quasi-static loading scenario could be broken up with movement. The purpose of this thesis was to explore the effect of these two strategies on biomechanical parameters and perceived pain during prolonged sitting. The first part of this thesis explores the effect office chair design features including lumbar support, forward seat pan tilt and a scapular relief backrest have on low back posture, muscle activity and pain compared to a control chair configuration. The second part of this thesis explores the effect active (walking) and passive (lumbar spine manipulation) movement interventions have on those same biomechanical factors. Methods: Twenty-eight participants (14 male and 14 female) were recruited for a radiographic study of low back and pelvic postures adopted in standing, maximum flexion and each of the four office chair conditions: control configuration, lumbar support, anterior seat pan tilt and backrest with scapular relief. Measures of lumbar lordosis, intervertebral joint angles and sacral tilt were taken from lateral lumbar radiographs and compared between conditions. To assess these chair features in a more realistic way, this radiographic study was followed by an in-vivo laboratory study allowing for prolonged exposures to each condition. In this study, 31 (15 males and 16 females) completed a standardized word processing task while sitting {{in each of the four}} chair conditions (control, lumbar support, forward seat pan tilt and scapular relief, presented in a random order) during four 30 -minute blocks. Measures of spine posture (upper back, lower back and pelvis), torso muscle activity (abdominal, back and gluteal), seat <b>pan</b> <b>pressure</b> and perceived pain were collected throughout this two-hour exposure and compared between conditions. To assess the impact of walking breaks on biomechanical parameters and perceived pain throughout a two-hour sitting exposure, 32 subjects (16 males and 16 females) were recruited for two data collections. In a random order, the subjects experienced either a control experiment that consisted of completing a standardized word processing task while sitting for two-hours on a neutral office chair seat pan (backrest removed) or an intervention experiment that was identical to the control session with the exception of two, two-minute, self-paced walking breaks at 40 minute intervals. Measures of spine posture (upper back, lower back and pelvis), back and pelvic muscle activity, seat <b>pan</b> <b>pressure</b> and perceived pain were collected throughout these two-hour exposures and compared between conditions. The effect of a lumbar spine manipulation, a passive form of movement imparted to the body, on biomechanical parameters of muscle activity, back and pelvic posture and perceived pain was examined in a shorter intervention study. Twenty subjects (10 male and 10 female) received either a lumbar spine manipulation or a control maneuver (lumbar spine manipulation set-up with preload but no thrust) in a random order after 40 -minute blocks of sitting on an office chair seat pan (backrest removed) completing a standardized word processing task. Surface muscle activity for the low back and pelvis, indwelling activity of a deep back muscle, spine and pelvic postures and perceived pain were compared between conditions. Results: The radiographic study confirms the extensive lumbar spine flexion in sitting compared to upright standing and maximum flexion. Sitting in an office chair, regardless of design features to reduce spine flexion, results in postures of approximately 70 % of maximum range of low back flexion. No significant differences in low back posture were found between the chair features or control configuration, however; significantly more anterior rotation of the pelvis was found with the lumbar support and forward seat pan configurations. In the prolonged sitting experiment, Study 2, use of the lumbar support and seat pan tilt features were again found to impart significant anterior rotation of the pelvis but these features also resulted in significantly more upright spine postures as well. These improved postures were maintained actively by muscles in the seat pan tilt condition and passively by the backrest in the lumbar support condition. Chair conditions had minimal impact on seat pressure variables. Despite the improvements in posture with two of the chair features and regardless of muscle activity levels, perceived back pain steadily increased to clinically significant levels throughout the two-hour exposure. Analysis of the pain scores revealed the presence of statistically different sub-groups: non-pain developers, subclinical pain developers and pain developers. Reassessing the effectiveness of each chair condition in light of these groups revealed that pain developers demonstrated a clear intolerance for the seat pan tilt configuration. In the third study, brief walking breaks of self-selected intensity had no effect on most biomechanical factors with the exception of reduced seat pressure and seat pressure area. The walking breaks were able to provide a significant, but short-lived, reduction in perceived pain, however, they were not able to reduce the level of perceived pain that develops by the end of a two-hour exposure to prolonged sitting. Similar to the walking breaks examined in Study 3; lumbar spine manipulation does not appear to effect postures or ultimate perceived pain levels during prolonged sitting. However, the results from Study 4 show an immediate reduction in perceived pain following both the manipulation and control maneuvers and a significant reduction in muscle activity following spine manipulation. Conclusions: Both posture and movement interventions are important to consider when addressing the issue of low back pain associated with sitting. However, it does appear that altering seated posture through chair design features alone is not enough to solve this problem. Indeed, while features such as lumbar supports and forward seat pan tilt have been shown reduce the flexion of the low back and pelvis, there is the potential for these features to add to the problem as opposed to reducing it. Specifically, forward seat pan tilt without appropriate back support will likely increase pain in a portion of the population. Movement interventions appear to be more promising in solving this problem, however, the ratio of work/break and intensity, frequency and duration parameters need to be explored further. Brief walking breaks at 40 -minute intervals can provide significant immediate relief of sitting associated back pain, however, this intervention is not able to alter biomechanical parameters or ultimate perceived pain in prolonged sitting. Similarly, there is evidence that lumbar spine manipulation may provide short term relief from sitting induced pain as well as reduced muscle activity in sitting, but future work needs to determine the implication of reduced muscle activation as well as the intervention dosage required to obtain longer lasting relief from pain...|$|R
40|$|The Constellation Program's Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) is {{required}} to accommodate the full population range of crewmembers according to the anthropometry requirements stated in the Human-Systems Integration Requirement (HSIR) document (CxP 70024). Seated height {{is one of many}} critical dimensions of importance to the CEV designers in determining the optimum seat configuration in the vehicle. Changes in seated height may have a large impact to the design, accommodation, and safety of the crewmembers. Seated height can change due to elongation of the spine when crewmembers are exposed to microgravity. Spinal elongation is the straightening of the natural curvature of the spine and the expansion of inter-vertebral disks. This straightening occurs due to fluid shifts in the body and the lack of compressive forces on the spinal vertebrae. Previous studies have shown that as the natural curvature of the spine straightens, an increase in overall height of 3 % of stature occurs which has been the basis of the current HSIR requirements. However due to variations in the torso/leg ratio and impact of soft tissue, data is nonexistent as to how spinal elongation specifically affects the measurement of seated height. In order to obtain this data, an experiment was designed to collect spinal elongation data while in a seated posture in microgravity. The {{purpose of this study was}} to provide quantitative data that represents the amount of change that occurs in seated height due to spinal elongation in microgravity environments. Given the schedule and budget constraints of ISS and Shuttle missions and the uniqueness of the problem, a methodology had to be developed to ensure that the seated height measurements were accurately collected. Therefore, simulated microgravity evaluations were conducted to test the methodology and procedures of the experiment. This evaluation obtained seat <b>pan</b> <b>pressure</b> and seated height data to a) ensure that the lap restraint provided sufficient restraint to eliminate any gap between the subject s gluteal surface and the seat pan and b) to document any necessary design and procedural changes needed due to the microgravity environment. The methodology and setup used during the simulated microgravity evaluations was replicable to the proposed methodology and setup for in-space missions. A flight-like Shuttle seat, pressure sensors, anthropometer, and existing hardware was used to measure seated height and contact area while experiencing microgravity. The outlying buttock and thigh surface contact areas were collected to determine if the subjects were in contact with the seat pan, while a measurer recorded their seated height with an anthropometer. The Anthropometry and Biomechanics Facility (ABF) completed data collection from three microgravity flights to assess the restraint methods and techniques to be used for the in-flight procedures performed by the crewmembers in orbit. The first flight demonstrated that the restraint system on the seat, used in a nominal configuration, did not sufficiently restrain a person in the seat. The results showed the subjects were not in full contact with the seat pan, resulting in inaccurate sitting height data. Thus, a second flight was conducted to test different restraint system options. The results showed that by 1) changing the restraint system from the nominal 3 -points of the 5 -point harness, which is used for crewmembers when fully suited with emergency equipment, and 2) rerouting the lap straps around the joint of the backrest, where the backrest and seat pan are joined, resulted in the optimal method to restrain a subject. This rerouting method allowed for the anchor location to change and pull the subjects back into the seat instead of being anchored at the side of the subjects thighs. The results from the third flight validated the final restraint system, which resulted in a verified methodology for collecting seated anthropometry to ultimately determine the amount of spil elongation in a microgravity environment...|$|R
