5|$|Balla's {{interest}} in capturing {{a single moment}} {{in a series of}} planes was inspired by his fascination with chronophotography. In later, more abstract works created during World War I, Balla used <b>planes</b> <b>of</b> color to suggest movement.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{computer}} simulations, {{the distance of}} the divalent carbon atom to its neighbours is claimed to be 138 picometers with a bond angle of 158.8°. The <b>planes</b> <b>of</b> the phenyl groups are almost at right angles to each other (the dihedral angle being 85.7°).|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} bombardments, between 04:30 and 05:00 local time, paratroopers were landed near the airfields. Dutch {{anti-aircraft}} batteries shot down numerous Ju 52 transport <b>planes</b> <b>of</b> the Luftwaffe's Transportgruppen.

5|$|In September 2011, Hasbro and IDW Publishing {{accorded to}} make a four-issue mini-series about Magic: The Gathering with a new story but heavily based on MTG {{elements}} and with a new Planeswalker called Dack Fayden, which story is mainly developed in the <b>planes</b> <b>of</b> Ravnica and Innistrad. The ongoing series started in February 2012.|$|E
5|$|Only {{a single}} example, FR-1 BuNo 39657, still survives. Deployed {{first to the}} NASA Ames Research Center, the {{aircraft}} served as an instructional airframe at a technical school before being acquired by the <b>Planes</b> <b>of</b> Fame Air Museum at Chino, California in the 1960s. After restoration to static display condition, 39657 was rolled out at Chino on 13 June 2009.|$|E
40|$|Analysis of {{zodiacal light}} {{observations}} from Mt. Haleakala, Hawaii {{shows that the}} symmetry <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> the zodiacal cloud near 1 A.

Since the symmetry <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> the inner zodiacal cloud is close to the orbital <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> Venus (Misconi and Weinberg, 1978; Leinert et al., 1979), it is suggested that the symmetry plane changes inclination with heliocentric distance...|$|R

5|$|Some {{speculative}} {{theories have}} proposed that our Universe {{is but one of}} a set of disconnected universes, collectively denoted as the multiverse, challenging or enhancing more limited definitions of the Universe.

5|$|In early {{editions of}} the setting, The Realms shared a unified {{cosmology}} with various other campaign settings called the Great Wheel. In this way each of the Dungeons & Dragons campaign settings were linked together to form one interwoven world connected by various <b>planes</b> <b>of</b> existence. With {{the release of the}} 2001 Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting, the setting was given its own distinct and separate cosmological arrangement, with unique planes not explicitly connected to those of the other settings.|$|E
5|$|It was in {{this manner}} that Fortune and Loveday claimed that they {{received}} a text, The Cosmic Doctrine, which was dictated to them in segments by the Masters between July 1923 and February 1925. These communications discussed the existence of seven <b>planes</b> <b>of</b> the universe, and were {{very similar to the}} ideas promoted in Moriarty's writings, in particular his Aphorism of Creation and Cosmic Principles. The cosmology present in this book was also similar to that presented in Theosophy. In the following years, Fortune distributed this material among her senior students, before publishing an edited version of The Cosmic Doctrine in 1949.|$|E
50|$|In {{presence}} of molecular orientation anisotropy in the sample, CARS images often display artefacts due to polarization-dependent selection rules {{that affects the}} measured intensity with respect of the alignment between the polarization <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> the incident light and the main orientation <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> the molecular bonds.This is due because the four-wave mixing process is more efficient when the polarization <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> the incident light is aligned with the main orientation <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> the molecular vibrations.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} robust method for {{measuring}} the effective <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> the Kuiper belt.

The <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> the Kuiper belt is inconsistent with the invariable <b>plane,</b> the <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> Jupiter, and the <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> Neptune at the greater than 3 σ level. Using linear secular perturbation theory, we show that the <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> the Kuiper belt is expected to oscillate about the position <b>of</b> the invariable <b>plane</b> with a period of 1. 9 million years and an amplitude of 1 º. 2. The present predicted position <b>of</b> the <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> the Kuiper belt has an inclination with respect to the ecliptic of 1 º. 74 and an ascending node of 86 º. 7, within 0 º. 20 of our measured position...|$|R

5|$|Glorious {{could carry}} up to 48 aircraft; when first recommissioned, she carried Fairey Flycatcher fighters, Blackburn Dart and Blackburn Ripon torpedo bombers, and Fairey IIIF {{reconnaissance}} <b>planes</b> <b>of</b> the Fleet Air Arm. From 1933 until Glorious {{returned to the}} United Kingdom in April 1940, aside from a period when refitting in the mid-1930s, she carried 802 Squadron which flew a mixture of nine Hawker Nimrod and three Hawker Osprey fighters, until re-equipping with a dozen Gloster Sea Gladiators in May 1939. 812 and 823 Squadrons were embarked for reconnaissance and anti-ship attack missions. They flew the Blackburn Ripon, the Blackburn Baffin and the Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers and as well as Fairey IIIF and Fairey Seal reconnaissance aircraft. When Glorious recommissioned after her refit in 1935, 825 Squadron was embarked, initially with Fairey IIIFs, but the squadron converted to Fairey Swordfish in May 1936.|$|E
5|$|North Korean {{aircraft}} {{first met}} US aircraft in combat during the Battle of Suwon Airfield, in which {{seven of the}} 13 North Korean aircraft were destroyed. The North Korean Lavochkin La-7 and Ilyushin Il-10 aircraft were easily outmatched by the superior North American F-82 Twin Mustang and F-80C Shooting Star aircraft, which also had better-trained pilots. The <b>planes</b> <b>of</b> the 8th Fighter Wing, which were attempting to defend Suwon to allow evacuation of UN civilians encountered repeated harassing attacks from North Korean aircraft operating out of Heijo Airfield in Pyongyang. Heijo was the KPAF's main base, but {{in the first few}} days in the war the US aircraft only had authorization to defend themselves if attacked, they could not conduct offensive operations into North Korea.|$|E
5|$|Reflector sights {{were invented}} as an {{improved}} gun-sight and since their invention {{they have been}} adapted to many types of weapons. When used with different types of guns, reflector sights are considered an improvement over simple iron sights (sights composed of two spaced metal aiming points {{that have to be}} aligned). Iron sights take considerable experience and skill in the user who has to hold a proper eye position and focus exclusively on the front sight, keeping it centered on the (unfocused) rear sight, while keeping the whole centered on a target at different distances, requiring alignment of all three <b>planes</b> <b>of</b> focus to achieve a hit. The reflector sight's single, parallax-free virtual image, in focus with the target, removes this aiming problem, helping poor, average, and expert shooters alike.|$|E

40|$|A one-point {{extension}} of an egglike inversive <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> order n exists if, and only if, n is 2 or 3. Hence {{there are no}} 4 -(18, 6, 1) designs and no 4 -(66, 10, 1) designs. An inversive <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> order n is a one-point extension <b>of</b> an affine <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> ordern, that is, a 3 -(n 2 + 1,n + 1, 1) design. An ovoid of PG(3, q), q> 2, {{is a set of}} q 2 + 1 points, no three collinear. An ovoid of PG(3, 2) is a set of 5 points, no four coplanar. Every <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> PG(3, q) meets an ovoid in either 1 or q + 1 points. The incidence structure whose points are those of an ovoid in PG(3, q), whose blocks are the <b>plane</b> sections <b>of</b> size q + 1 of the ovoid, and whose incidence is given by set membership, is an inversive <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> order q.

5|$|The {{chiral nematic}} phase {{exhibits}} chirality (handedness). This phase {{is often called}} the cholesteric phase because it was first observed for cholesterol derivatives. Only chiral molecules (i.e., those that have no internal <b>planes</b> <b>of</b> symmetry) can give rise to such a phase. This phase exhibits a twisting of the molecules perpendicular to the director, with the molecular axis parallel to the director. The finite twist angle between adjacent molecules is due to their asymmetric packing, which results in longer-range chiral order. In the smectic C* phase (an asterisk denotes a chiral phase), the molecules have positional ordering in a layered structure (as in the other smectic phases), with the molecules tilted by a finite angle {{with respect to the}} layer normal. The chirality induces a finite azimuthal twist from one layer to the next, producing a spiral twisting of the molecular axis along the layer normal.|$|E
5|$|The film, {{a romantic}} action-war picture, was rewritten by scriptwriters Hope Loring and Louis D. Lighton from {{a story by}} John Monk Saunders to {{accommodate}} Bow, Paramount's biggest star at the time. Wellman was hired as {{he was the only}} director in Hollywood at the time who had World War I combat pilot experience, although Richard Arlen and John Monk Saunders had also served in the war as military aviators. The film was shot on location on a budget of $2 million at Kelly Field in San Antonio, Texas between September 7, 1926 and April 7, 1927. Hundreds of extras and some 300 pilots were involved in the filming, including pilots and <b>planes</b> <b>of</b> the United States Army Air Corps which were brought in for the filming and to provide assistance and supervision. Wellman extensively rehearsed the scenes for the Battle of Saint-Mihiel over ten days with some 3500 infantrymen on a battlefield made for the production on location. Although the cast and crew had much spare time during the filming because of weather delays, shooting conditions were intense, and Wellman frequently conflicted with the military officers brought in to supervise the picture.|$|E
5|$|The {{lack of an}} heir for Uriel Septim {{has broken}} an old covenant—the barrier to Oblivion: a {{dangerous}} realm that is in another dimension. Multiple gates to Oblivion open, and an invasion of Tamriel begins by magical creatures known as Daedra, killing and destroying anything in their path. Jauffre tells the player {{that the only way}} to close the gates permanently is to find someone of the royal bloodline to retake the throne and relight the Dragonfires—with the Amulet of Kings—in the Imperial City. Fortunately, there is an illegitimate son named Martin, who is a priest in the city of Kvatch. Upon arriving at Kvatch, the player finds that the Daedra have destroyed the city and very few survivors remain. A massive Oblivion Gate is obstructing the main city entrance, and the player must venture through the gate into the Deadlands—one of the <b>planes</b> <b>of</b> Oblivion—in order to close it from the inside and allow access to the city. After closing the gate, the player enters Kvatch and takes it back from the Daedra with the assistance of surviving guardsmen. Fortunately, Martin has survived and the player persuades him to come to Weynon Priory.|$|E

5|$|The player {{controls}} Raziel, a disfigured and ghostly vampire. The game {{is normally}} shown from a third-person perspective behind Raziel, but players can rotate the viewpoint around him. Gameplay relies largely on shifting between {{the material and}} spectral <b>planes</b> <b>of</b> existence to progress through areas. Although interaction with objects is limited in the spectral realm, this can be advantageous, because Raziel can phase through otherwise impassable gates there, and water is insubstantial, allowing him to walk on lakebeds; however, blocks, doors, and switches can be manipulated only in the physical realm. Many puzzles {{are based on the}} differences between the two realms; for example, platforms and environment features in one realm may change form to open new paths in the other. Block puzzles are also common and require the rotation, flipping, and moving of large blocks to progress, often with a time limit and while avoiding enemies.|$|E
