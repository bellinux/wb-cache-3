He <b>planted</b> trees with <b>tubed</b> roots, so that the roots sought water deeper in the ground and the wind could not tear them. Losses were still high, but decreasing.

The Acacia was a success, and he arranged the plants so that the Acacias protected the pines from the wind.|$|R

Sometimes Newman kept his promise of following Mr. Tristram, in half an hour, to the Occidental, and sometimes he forgot it.

He was not what is called subjective, though when he felt that her interest was sincere, he made an almost heroic attempt to be. He told her a great many things he had done, and regaled her with anecdotes of Western life; she was from Philadelphia, and with her eight years in Paris, talked of herself as a languid Oriental. But some other person was always the hero of the tale, by no means always to his advantage; and Newman's own emotions were but scantily chronicled.

60|$|One {{of these}} July evenings Lennan remembered beyond all others. He had come, {{after a hard}} day's work, out from his studio into the {{courtyard}} garden to smoke a cigarette and feel the sun on his cheek before it sank behind the wall. A piano-organ far away was grinding out a waltz; and on an hydrangea tub, under the drawing-room window, he sat down to listen. Nothing was visible from there, save just the square patch of a quite blue sky, and one soft plume of smoke from his own kitchen chimney; nothing audible save that tune, and the never-ending street murmur. Twice birds flew across--starlings. It was very peaceful, and his thoughts went floating like the smoke of his cigarette, to meet who-knew-what other thoughts--for thoughts, no doubt, had little swift lives of their own; desired, found their mates, and, lightly blending, sent forth offspring. Why not? All things were possible in this wonder-house of a world. Even that waltz tune, floating away, would find some melody to wed, and twine with, and produce a fresh chord that might float in turn to catch the hum of a gnat or fly, and breed again. Queer--how everything sought to entwine with something else! On one of the pinkish blooms of the hydrangea he noted a bee--of all things, in this hidden-away garden of tiles and gravel and <b>plants</b> in <b>tubs!</b> The little furry, lonely thing was drowsily clinging there, {{as if it had}} forgotten what it had come for--seduced, maybe, like himself, from labour by these last rays of the sun.

Transcript levels of all 15 tubulin genes were decreased by continuous white light, although to different degrees. Detailed analysis was performed with the beta-tubulin TUB 1 gene. The transcript level of TUB 1 was high in etiolated seedlings and decreased to approximately 20 % of the dark mRNA level after 2 to 6 hr of white light treatment. We showed that this downregulation requires high-irradiance light treatment and that multiple photoreceptors are involved. In particular, using phytochrome mutants and narrow wave band light, we demonstrated that both the phytochrome A (phyA) -mediated far-red light high-irradiance response and the phytochrome B (phyB) -mediated red light high-irradiance response {{are involved in the}} downregulation of TUB 1 expression by white light.

60|$|A {{few months}} after this I {{returned}} to Europe, and some three years elapsed. I {{had been living in}} Paris, and, toward the end of October, I went from that city to Havre, to meet my sister and her husband, who had written me that they were about to arrive there. On reaching Havre I found that the steamer was already in; I was nearly two hours late. I repaired directly to the hotel, where my relatives were already established. My sister had gone to bed, exhausted and disabled by her voyage; she was a sadly incompetent sailor, and her sufferings on this occasion had been extreme. She wished, for the moment, for undisturbed rest, and was unable to see me more than five minutes; so it was agreed that we should remain at Havre until the next day. My brother-in-law, who was anxious about his wife, was unwilling to leave her room; but she insisted upon his going out with me to take a walk and recover his landlegs. The early autumn day was warm and charming, and our stroll through the bright-colored, busy streets of the old French seaport was sufficiently entertaining. We walked along the sunny, noisy quays, and then turned into a wide, pleasant street, which lay half in sun and half in shade--a French provincial street, that looked like an old water-color drawing: tall, gray, steep-roofed, red-gabled, many-storied houses; green shutters on windows and old scroll-work above them; flower-pots in balconies, and white-capped women in doorways. We walked in the shade; all this stretched away on the sunny side of the street and made a picture. We looked at it as we passed along; then, suddenly, my brother-in-law stopped, pressing my arm and staring. I followed his gaze and saw that we had paused just before coming to a café, where, under an awning, several tables and chairs were disposed upon the pavement The windows were open behind; half a dozen <b>plants</b> in <b>tubs</b> were ranged beside the door; the pavement was besprinkled with clean bran. It was a nice little, quiet, old-fashioned café; inside, in the comparative dusk, I saw a stout, handsome woman, with pink ribbons in her cap, perched up with a mirror behind her back, smiling at some one who was out of sight. All this, however, I perceived afterwards; what I first observed was a lady sitting alone, outside, at one of the little marble-topped tables. My brother-in-law had stopped to look at her. There was something on the little table, but she was leaning back quietly, with her hands folded, looking down the street, away from us. I saw her only in something less than profile; nevertheless, I instantly felt that I had seen her before.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{just beyond}} there," [...] said the landlord, {{and pointed to}} the tree-tops of the park, above the {{opposite}} houses. Newman followed the first cross-road to the right--it was bordered with mouldy cottages--and in a few moments saw before him the peaked roofs of the towers. Advancing farther, he found himself before a vast iron gate, rusty and closed; here he paused a moment, looking through the bars. The chateau was near the road; this was at once its merit and its defect; but its aspect was extremely impressive. Newman learned afterwards, from a guide-book of the province, that it dated from the time of Henry IV. It presented to the wide, paved area which preceded it and which was edged with shabby farm-buildings an immense facade of dark time-stained brick, flanked by two low wings, each of which terminated in a little Dutch-looking pavilion capped with a fantastic roof. Two towers rose behind, and behind the towers was a mass of elms and beeches, now just faintly green. But the great feature was a wide, green river which washed the foundations of the chateau. The building rose from an island in the circling stream, so that this formed a perfect moat spanned by a two-arched bridge without a parapet. The dull brick walls, which here and there made a grand, straight sweep; the ugly little cupolas of the wings, the deep-set windows, the long, steep pinnacles of mossy slate, all mirrored themselves in the tranquil river. Newman rang at the gate, and was almost frightened at the tone with which a big rusty bell above his head replied to him. An old woman came out from the gate-house and opened the creaking portal just wide enough for him to pass, and he went in, across the dry, bare court and the little cracked white slabs of the causeway on the moat. At the door of the chateau he waited for some moments, and this gave him a chance to observe that Fleurieres was not [...] "kept up," [...] and to reflect that it was a melancholy place of residence. [...] "It looks," [...] said Newman to himself--and I give the comparison for what it is worth--"like a Chinese penitentiary." [...] At last the door was opened by a servant whom he remembered to have seen in the Rue de l'Universite. The man's dull face brightened as he perceived our hero, for Newman, for indefinable reasons, enjoyed the confidence of the liveried gentry. The footman led the way across a great central vestibule, with a pyramid of <b>plants</b> in <b>tubs</b> in the middle of glass doors all around, to {{what appeared to be the}} principal drawing-room of the chateau. Newman crossed the threshold of a room of superb proportions, which made him feel at first like a tourist with a guide-book and a cicerone awaiting a fee. But when his guide had left him alone, with the observation that he would call Madame la Comtesse, Newman perceived that the salon contained little that was remarkable save a dark ceiling with curiously carved rafters, some curtains of elaborate, antiquated tapestry, and a dark oaken floor, polished like a mirror. He waited some minutes, walking up and down; but at length, as he turned at the end of the room, he saw that Madame de Cintre had come in by a distant door. She wore a black dress, and she stood looking at him. As the length of the immense room lay between them he had time to look at her before they met in the middle of it.|$|R

In 1787 it occurred to certain West India planters and merchants, resident in London, that it would benefit the natives, and perhaps themselves, if the bread-fruit tree, which flourished in Tahiti (the Otaheite of Captain Cook and Sir Joseph Banks, see Poetical Works, 1899, ii. 7, note 2) and other islands of the South Seas, could be acclimatized in the West Indies. A petition was addressed to the king, {{with the result that}} a vessel, with a burden of 215 tons, which Banks christened the Bounty, sailed from Spithead December 23, 1787. Lieutenant William Bligh, who had sailed with Cook in the Resolution, acted as commanding officer, and under him were five midshipmen, a master, two master's mates, etc.--forty-four persons all told. The Bounty arrived at Tahiti October 26, 1788, and there for six delightful months the ship's company tarried, [...] "fleeting the time carelessly, as in the elder world." [...] But [...] "Scripture saith an ending to all fine things must be," [...] and on April 4, 1789, the Bounty, with a cargo of over a thousand bread-fruit trees, <b>planted</b> in pots, <b>tubs,</b> and boxes (see for plate of the pots, etc., A Voyage, etc., 1792, p. 1), sailed away westward for the Cape of Good Hope, and the West Indies.

The boatswain, William Cole, was ordered to hoist out the ship's launch, which measured twenty-three feet from stem to stern, and into this open boat Bligh, together with eighteen of the crew, who were or were supposed to be on his side, were thrust, on pain of instant death. When they were in the boat they were [...] "veered round with a rope, and finally cast adrift."

40|$|The current rice {{varieties}} {{grown by}} Australian farmers {{are susceptible to}} low temperature events particularly during the reproductive stage of plant development. The best management practices of sowing within the recommended time period and maintaining deep water (20 – 25 cm) through the microspore development stage only offer limited protection. There {{is a need to}} develop more cold tolerant varieties and to do so requires the development of low-temperature screening capacity for the NSW rice breeding program. This study looked at the requirements of adapting a controlled-temperature glasshouse facility to enable screening for tolerance to low temperatures during the reproductive stage of rice development. The investigations were grouped into two areas; 1) the physical aspects of the low temperature facility including the location of plants within the facility and within the tubs used to grow the plants and whether these can influence the reliability of the screening and 2) the biological effects of nitrogen (N) concentration in the plant at panicle initiation (PI) and plant susceptibility to low temperatures, and whether growth stage of the plant relative to PI at the start of low temperature treatment influenced floret sterility. A series of nine experiments were conducted at the Deniliquin Agricultural Research and Advisory Station glasshouse facility using up to five rice varieties selected for their divergence in low-temperature tolerance. One other experiment was conducted in a different facility. The modified glasshouse facility in Deniliquin was effective in providing the targeted screening environment of 27 °C day and 13 °C night temperature regime. There was however a smaller than expected effect of the low temperature exposure in some of the experiments with sterility following low temperature ranging from 9. 9 % to 27. 7 %. There was also a higher than expected level of sterility in the controls (i. e. not exposed to low temperature) with sterility levels up to 58 % recorded in one experiment. The causes of these overall effects are not known. Notwithstanding these overall effects {{there were a number of}} findings that are important for developing a reliable screening facility. The spatial arrangement of the plants within the low temperature facility effected the level of sterility highlighting the need for experimental design to consider spatial variation. The existence of edge effects was identified within the tubs used to maintain permanent water on the potted plants whereby the outer <b>plants</b> in the <b>tubs</b> were less damaged by the low-temperature treatment. The overall N level in the leaf tissue was low even at the equivalent rate of 250 kg N ha- 1 and there was only a very modest and inconsistent response in N concentration at PI to N application rates ranging from 0 to 250 kg ha- 1. However, the method of growing the plants in pots and of nitrogen fertiliser application did not alter the N concentration. The concentration was the same when N was added either, on the same day as permanent water application, or three days prior to permanent water application. Also restricting the direction of water movement through the pots and therefore the soil within the pots did not alter the amount of N in the plants at PI. The low plant N concentrations were consistent across two glasshouses in which soil from the same source was used suggesting a soil limitation. A soil test identified that the soil phosphorus (P) was at a level at which plants have responded to P application under field conditions, and the loamy texture of the soil had an associated low cation exchange capacity in comparison to medium to heavy clay soil types commonly associated with rice growing. These factors may have reduced the N retention and uptake and, in part, explain the low injury from the low temperature exposures. In the variety Millin, there was no significant effect of timing of the exposure on sterility until it commenced 12 to 15 days after PI. This is a significant finding for a breeding program that must expose lines of unknown phenological development. It means that even though there are small differences in the rates of development, there is no large effect of this on sterility. However, this response was not seen in the other varieties tested and thus requires further validation. It was difficult to induce repeatable levels of floret sterility in this series of experiments most likely due to the low N concentrations in part due to the properties of the soil used to grow the plants. This highlights the importance of standardising all cultural aspects in order to provide uniform and repeatable screening information. The spatial effects highlight importance of experimental design for effective exposure to low temperature treatments, incorporation of the capacity for spatial analysis in the statistical design, the use of standard variety checks for floret sterility after low temperature treatment, and the determination of N concentration in plant tissue prior to exposure...|$|R
