The empirical study is based on a survey that analyses price knowledge using <b>perception</b> <b>error.</b> Considering different socio-demographic and behavioural aspects of consumers in relation to prices, an analysis was carried out to ascertain whether or not there are significant differences in <b>perception</b> <b>error.</b> The results reveal significant differences for the price range and some socio-demographic variables...|$|E

These studies have shown travel time to be an indispensable variable for such analysis and usually consider it to be a deterministic variable. This formulation does not allow us to capture travelers’ <b>perception</b> <b>error</b> regarding travel time, and recent studies have indicated that this error can {{have a significant effect on}} modal choice behavior. In this study, we propose a logistic regression model with a hierarchical random error term. The proposed model adds a new random error term for the travel time variable. This term structure enables us to investigate travelers’ <b>perception</b> <b>error</b> regarding travel time from a given choice behavior dataset. We also propose an extended model that allows constraining the sign of this error in the model. We develop two Gibbs samplers to estimate the basic hierarchical model and the extended model.

40|$|Abstract — A genetic {{algorithm}} {{is used to}} simulate the evolution of Moore machines in the iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma stage-game. The machines are prone to two types of errors: (a) implementation <b>errors</b> and (b) <b>perception</b> <b>errors.</b> We conduct computational experiments that incorporate different levels of errors {{in an effort to}} assess whether and how the distribution of machines in the population changes. In sharp contrast to previous studies, the incorporation of implementation and <b>perception</b> <b>errors</b> is sufficient to reduce cooperative outcomes. In addition, the study identifies a threshold error-level. At and above the threshold error-level, the prevailing machines converge to the open-loop machine Always-Defect. On the other hand, below the threshold, the prevailing machines are closed-loop and diverse. The diversity thus impedes our inferential projections on the superiority of a particular machine.

30|$|This {{idea that}} the scene size, and {{therefore}} memory load, {{plays a role in}} change <b>perception</b> <b>errors</b> has been examined previously. Gregg and Samuel (2008) found evidence for change deafness (high errors) despite generally accurate performance on a cued recall task. In vision, Mitroff et al. (2004) report a similar finding; however, their results are less clear. Mitroff et al. (2004) in fact reported that memory for pre- and post-change scenes was preserved even when participants reported no awareness of a change, but in follow-up experiments they found that the stored representations are fragile; simply reversing the question order from cued-recall first to cued-recall last lead to significant decrements in recall. To further explore the interaction between recall accuracy and change <b>perception</b> <b>errors</b> and assess memory for scene elements, the present study presents participants with a cued recall task following each change perception trial.|$|R
40|$|The {{dominant}} {{method for}} measuring values of travel time savings (VOT), {{and values of}} travel time reliability (VOR) is discrete choice modeling. Generally, the data sources for these models are: stated choice experiments, and revealed preference observations. There are few studies using revealed preference data. These studies have only used travel times measured by devices such as loop detectors, and thus the <b>perception</b> <b>error</b> of travelers has been largely ignored. In this study, the influence of commuters’ <b>perception</b> <b>error</b> is investigated on data collected of commuters recruited from previous research.

Especially when traffic management measures change the level of service, understanding how this change is perceived by drivers {{is vital to the}} prediction of whether drivers will adapt their behavior. Psychological and behavioral literature indicates that user awareness of changes is usually limited and that many changes go unnoticed; however, empirical evidence in a transportation context is scarce. This study focused on stopped delay at signalized intersections and addressed the accuracy of drivers’ perception of absolute waiting time at signalized intersections and drivers’ level of awareness of differences in waiting time. Data were collected by means of interviews and manual waiting time measurements. The results showed that on average respondents could estimate fairly accurately the size and direction of the absolute waiting time, but had little sense of relative differences in waiting time. In addition, small waiting times were found to be overestimated, but waiting times greater than 55 s were underestimated, and the <b>perception</b> <b>error</b> never exceeded the maximum actual waiting time. An unpredicted finding was {{that the vast majority of}} the respondents stated that their waiting time was shorter than expected, even in the case of long waiting times.

40|$|We use {{a genetic}} {{algorithm}} {{to simulate the}} evolution of error-prone finite automata in the repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma game. In particular, the automata are subjected to implementation and <b>perception</b> <b>errors.</b> The computational experiments examine whether and how the distribution of outcomes and genotypes of the coevolved automata change with different levels of errors. We find that {{the complexity of the}} automata is decreasing in the probability of errors. Furthermore, the prevailing structures tend to exhibit low reciprocal cooperation and low tolerance to defections as the probability of errors increases. In addition, by varying the error level, the study identifies a threshold. Below the threshold, the prevailing structures are closed-loop (history-dependent) and diverse, which impedes any inferential projections on the superiority of a particular automaton. However, at and above the threshold, the prevailing structures converge to the open-loop (history-independent) automaton Always-Defect (ALLD).

A novelty {{of the study is}} that it allows for three types of errors that affect agents’ strategies in distinct ways: (a) implementation <b>errors,</b> (b) <b>perception</b> <b>errors</b> of one’s own action, and (c) <b>perception</b> <b>errors</b> of the opponent’s action. We also derive numerical results based on the payoff matrix used in the tournaments of Axelrod. Strategies’ payoffs are monitored as the likelihood of committing errors increases from zero to one, which enables us to provide a taxonomy of best response strategies. We find that for some range of error levels, a unique best response (i. e. a dominant strategy) exists. In all other, the population composition can vary based on the proportion of each strategist’s type and/or the payoffs of the matrix. Overall, our results indicate that the emergence of cooperation is considerably weak at most error levels...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in visual activity recognition {{have raised the}} possibility of applications such as automated video surveillance. Effective approaches for such problems however require the ability to recognize the plans of the agents from video information. Although traditional plan recognition algorithms depend on access to sophisticated domain models, one recent promising direction involves learning shallow models directly from the observed activity sequences, and using them to recognize/predict plans. One limitation of such approaches is that they expect observed action sequences as training data. In many cases involving vision or sensing from raw data, there is considerably uncertainty about the specific action at any given time point. The most we can expect in such cases is probabilistic information about the action at that point. The training data will then be sequences of such observed action distributions. In this paper, we focus on doing effective plan recognition with such uncertain observations. Our contribution is a novel extension of word vector embedding techniques to directly handle such observation distributions as input. This involves computing embeddings by minimizing the distance between distributions (measured as KL-divergence). We will show that our approach has superior performance when the <b>perception</b> <b>error</b> rate (PER) is higher, and competitive performance when the PER is lower. We will also explore the possibility of using importance sampling techniques to handle observed action distributions with traditional word vector embeddings. We will show that although such approaches can give good recognition accuracy, they take significantly longer training time and their performance will degrade significantly at higher <b>perception</b> <b>error</b> rate...|$|E
30|$|We {{explored}} the eye-position data {{to identify the}} possible causes of errors for situations where either the technical or disciplinary decision was incorrect.

When the total fixation time in the contact zone was equal to or exceeded 1000  ms, the error was probably due to a failure to categorize the situation according to the Laws of the Game (categorization error). For the open play situations, the total fixation times in the contact zone of the attacking player were taken into account.|$|E
40|$|Motion cueing {{algorithms}} (MCAs) {{are playing}} {{a significant role in}} driving simulators, aiming to deliver the most accurate human sensation to the simulator drivers compared with a real vehicle driver, without exceeding the physical limitations of the simulator. This paper provides the optimisation design of an MCA for a vehicle simulator, in order to find the most suitable washout algorithm parameters, while respecting all motion platform physical limitations, and minimising human <b>perception</b> <b>error</b> between real and simulator driver. One of the main limitations of the classical washout filters is that it is attuned by the worst-case scenario tuning method. This is based on trial and error, and is effected by driving and programmers experience, making this the most significant obstacle to full motion platform utilisation. This leads to inflexibility of the structure, production of false cues and makes the resulting simulator fail to suit all circumstances. In addition, the classical method does not take minimisation of human <b>perception</b> <b>error</b> and physical constraints into account. Production of motion cues and the impact of different parameters of classical washout filters on motion cues remain inaccessible for designers for this reason. The aim {{of this paper is to}} provide an optimisation method for tuning the MCA parameters, based on nonlinear filtering and genetic algorithms. This is done by taking vestibular sensation error into account between real and simulated cases, as well as main dynamic limitations, tilt coordination and correlation coefficient. Three additional compensatory linear blocks are integrated into the MCA, to be tuned in order to modify the performance of the filters successfully. The proposed optimised MCA is implemented in MATLAB/Simulink software packages. The results generated using the proposed method show increased performance in terms of human sensation, reference shape tracking and exploiting the platform more efficiently without reaching the motion limitations...|$|E
30|$|The {{reportedly}} {{positive effect}} {{of providing a}} cue {{to the location of}} a change suggests that spatial position and spatial separation may be useful for perceptually segmenting a scene, which in turn may reduce change <b>perception</b> <b>errors.</b> Studies addressing the relationship between spatial separation and change perception, however, are few, limited to virtual audio manipulations, and are generally not in agreement. Gregg and Samuel (2008) found no segregation advantage for spatially separated sources in a virtual array, whereas Eramudugolla et al. (2005) found that spatial separation resulted in significantly fewer change <b>perception</b> <b>errors.</b> More generally, spatial position can be a cue to successful perceptual segregation (e.g., Bregman, 1993; Yost, 1993, 1997) and a number of psychophysical studies have shown (auditory) spatial cues to provide beneficial effects for perceptual performance (e.g., Broadbent, 1954; Best et al., 2006; Jones & Litovsky, 2011), including auditory search (Eramudugolla et al., 2008). Specifically, spatial separation has been shown to provide a reduction or elimination of informational masking effects (e.g., Ihlefeld & Shinn-Cunningham, 2008; Kidd et al., 1994), a phenomenon that may share common perceptual mechanisms with patterns in reports of change deafness (Dickerson & Gaston, 2014). There is clearly reason to expect that spatial separation may reduce change <b>perception</b> <b>errors</b> by reducing perceptual ambiguity, but as was previously mentioned, the literature on this topic as it relates to change deafness is sparse and conflicting. The present study uses a physical multi-speaker array and compares scenes with spatially separated versus spatially co-located sounds to systematically evaluate the role of spatial separation in modulating change errors. The use of sounds presented over speakers in the free-field, rather than the use of a virtual spatial manipulation, is an important methodological change from previous studies, as it is often the case that virtual spatial arrays are more often lateralized than truly localized (Yost, 1993) and artifacts associated with headphone lateralization, or the use of a generic head-related transfer function could, in part, explain the mixed results of previous studies investigating the role of spatial cues in change deafness.|$|R

We examine the effectiveness of using this basis derivative strategy for both summer and winter seasons, using both linear and nonlinear hedging instruments and the impacts of default risk and <b>perception</b> <b>errors</b> on weather hedging efficiency. We also compare the hedging effectiveness obtained using weather indices produced by both the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and Risk Management Solutions, Inc. (RMS).

Through the investigation, several relationships among <b>perception,</b> production <b>errors,</b> and LOR were revealed. In addition, the types and patterns of the pronunciation errors {{as well as the}} phonological processes involved in the mispronunciations were investigated. The instrument included both perception and production tasks, as well as a demographic questionnaire. More specifically, the production task contains two syllable positions: word initial and word final; two sources: word list and text. The data were analyzed through auditory and spectrographic devices with an involvement of an inter-rater agreement. The results showed that there was a positive relationship between <b>perception</b> and production <b>errors</b> {{for each of the three}} groups. Namely, the more <b>perception</b> <b>errors</b> made by the Taiwanese ESL learners, the more production errors occurred. The correlation increases with each group, i. e., with LOR. The relationship between LOR and <b>perception</b> and production <b>errors</b> were significantly negative as the longer the learners had stayed in the US, the fewer <b>errors</b> in <b>perception</b> and production were made and vice versa. A descriptive analysis revealed that the initial theta and the final eth are the most difficult sounds for the Taiwanese learners to perceive. In addition, both voiceless and voiced IFs were found to be difficult to pronounce in the final position. Regarding the source where the target sounds were located, the results indicated that reading text (rather than a word list) caused more pronunciation errors for most of the learners except the group with LOR at least 7 years, which had a better performance in the production task compared with the other two groups, regardless of which source the target sounds were located. From the overall findings, ESL teachers are encouraged to apply multiple teaching tools and to provide feedback with effective correction techniques to learners in order to adjust and overcome their pronunciation errors...|$|R

Our results show that the inefficiency bound of SUE depends on the class of link cost functions as well as the degree of <b>perception</b> <b>error</b> and the network complexity.

This study presents a systematic identification of factors that lead to <b>perception</b> <b>errors</b> of travel time. In addition, the factors are related to similar factors on time perception research in psychology.

For this purpose, we conducted a study in which subjects were confronted with motor and non-motor errors, and had them perform a sensorimotor transformation task in which they were likely to commit motor errors of different magnitudes (internal errors). In addition to the internally committed motor errors, non-motor errors (external errors) were added to the feedback in some trials. We found that activity in the anterior insula, inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), cerebellum, precuneus, and posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC) correlated positively with the magnitude of external errors. The middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and the pMFC cortex correlated positively with the magnitude of the total error fed back to subjects (internal plus external). No significant positive correlation between internal error and brain activity could be detected.

For this purpose stochastic user equilibrium traffic assignment is used to describe travelers’ route choice behaviors in the lower programming level, and a prescribed travel time threshold is set in the upper level problem as a constraint to travel time. By assuming that link capacity is continuous truncated normal random variable, using Monte Carlo simulation technique in conjunction with the sensitivity analysis method of road network equilibrium flow, a heuristic algorithm is established to estimate road network capacity reliability. Numerical study on a small road network is presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed model and algorithm.

Even {{though there are}} several advantages for classical washout filters, such as short processing time, simplicity and ease of adjustment, they have several shortcomings. The main disadvantage is the fixed scheme and parameters of the classical washout filter cause inflexibility of the structure and thus the resulting simulator fails to suit all circumstances. Moreover, it is a conservative approach and the platform cannot be fully exploited. The aim {{of this research is}} to present a fuzzy logic approach and take the human <b>perception</b> <b>error</b> into account in the classical motion cueing algorithm, in order to improve both the physical limits of restitution and realistic human sensations. The fuzzy compensator signal is applied to adjust the filtered signals on the longitudinal and rotational channels online, as well as the tilt coordination to minimize the vestibular sensation error below the human perception threshold. The results indicate that the proposed fuzzy logic controllers significantly minimize the drawbacks of having fixed parameters and conservativeness in the classical washout filter.

The accuracy of the alignment algorithm is evaluated when applying three non-binary scoring matrices based on phone confusion-pairs from each phone decoder, on phonological similarity and on human <b>perception</b> <b>errors.</b> Alignment results with the three continuous-score matrices are compared to results with a baseline binary matrix, at word and subtitle levels. The non-binary matrices achieved clearly better results. Matrix samples are given in the project’s website...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel reliability-based stochastic user equilibrium traffic assignment model {{in view of}} the day-to-day demand fluctuations for multi-class transportation networks. In the model, each class of travelers has a different safety margin for on-time arrival in response to the stochastic travel times raised from demand variations. Travelers' <b>perception</b> <b>errors</b> on travel time are also considered in the model. This model is formulated as an equivalent variational inequality problem, which is solved by the proposed heuristic solution algorithm. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the applications of the proposed model and the efficiency of solution algorithm.

40|$|AbstractThe {{probability}} {{to occur}} in drive <b>perception</b> <b>errors</b> increases as {{the complexity of the}} road alignment increases. In particular <b>perceptions</b> <b>errors</b> could be significantly relevant in the conditions of horizontal curves overlapped with sag vertical curves (sag combinations or combined curves). The highway geometric design guidelines of several Countries provide suggestions for the coordination of the sag combinations in order to avoid combined configurations which can bring to undesirable optical effects and a reduced safety. Such suggestions come from studies based on the drawing of the perspective of the road. This drawing method is heavily limited with regards to the simulation of the perspective view of the highway to the driver during the dynamic task of the driving. Interactive driving simulation methods are deemed to be more efficient for these aims. This paper reports the results of a study carried out using an interactive driving simulator and aimed at evaluating the effects on the driver's speed behavior of different configurations of sag combinations and non-combined curves on flat grade with the same features as the horizontal curves of the sag combinations (reference curves). The main result was that on suggested sag combinations the driver's speed behavior did not differ in any statistically significant way from that on the reference curves. Whereas the critical sag combinations (configurations that should be avoided) caused a high reduction in speed along the tangent–curve transition, which pointed the driver's reaction to the wrong perception of the road alignment This result, therefore, confirmed the effectiveness of the road design guidelines for the coordination of horizontal curves and sag vertical curves...|$|R
