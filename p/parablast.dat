40|$|Abstract: Retrieving {{homologous}} DNA {{and protein}} sequences from existing databases {{is a fundamental}} routine in bioinformatics research. Programs of the NCBI BLAST family are widely used for this purpose. We evaluated <b>paraBLAST,</b> a parallelised version of the NCBI BLAST algorithm, using a Message Passing Interface (MPI) on a multi-node compute cluster. Here, we propose static and dynamic database-partitioning schemes based {{on the availability of}} the cluster. We evaluated the application of the algorithm in querying nucleotide sequences against a large-scale sequence database with different numbers of database partitions, and hence, different numbers of CPUs. Since the program's tasks are performed independently of each other, each available CPU can run its own copy of BLAST queries, resulting in reduced interference between processes and leading to a highly scalable solution...|$|E
30|$|Liver {{samples for}} {{histological}} analyses (21 per treatment) were fixed in 2 % glutardialdehyde (25 % solution in water; Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) diluted with a cacodylate-sodium buffer (0.1  M, pH 7.6; AppliChem GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany) {{for at least}} 2  weeks. Each liver sample was the whole organ of an individual due to {{the small size of}} the fish. For histopathological analyses, fixed liver samples were washed three times for 10  min with the same buffer, dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol and infiltrated with paraffin wax (<b>Parablast,</b> Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) in a tissue processor (TP 1020, Leica). After paraffin embedding, samples were cut into 3  µm slices using a Leica SM 2000 R microtome. There were eight slices per slide from four different planes of the organ. One portion of the slices was stained with haematoxylin–eosin (to visualise the nuclei, cytoplasm, connective tissue and muscles), and the other with alcian blue-PAS (to visualise mucus and glycogen; technical details in Additional file 1 : Paragraph 2). Analyses were conducted using a microscope (Axioskop 2, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Slides were first examined qualitatively to gain an overview and identify pathologies. In a second step, the observed pathologies were semi-quantitatively assessed and classified into one of five different categories (1 : control, 2 : slight reaction, 3 : medium reaction, 4 : strong reaction, and 5 : destruction) according to the criteria published by Triebskorn et al. [72]. In a further step, all samples were analysed a second time after being blinded and randomised to avoid an observer bias. In addition, all sections were categorised according to their glycogen content (high, medium and low), again in a blinded and randomised manner. A high glycogen content was described by the dark-red staining of glycogen which can be found evenly in the whole liver. A bright-red stain and a partial spread of glycogen in the liver indicated a medium glycogen content. If almost no glycogen was visible, the sample was classified as low glycogen amount.|$|E
