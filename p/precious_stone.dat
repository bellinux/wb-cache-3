After the Norman conquest of England in 1066, the abbot planned out over 300 new houses within a grid-iron pattern at a {{location}} that {{was close to the}} abbey precincts. Edmund's cult was promoted and flourished, but it declined in subsequent years and the saint did not reappear in any liturgical calendars until the appearance of Abbo of Fleury's Passio Sancti Eadmundi in the 12th century. King John is said to have given a great sapphire and a <b>precious</b> <b>stone</b> set in gold to the shrine, which he was permitted to keep upon the condition that it was returned to the abbey when he died.|$|E

25|$|For {{thousands}} of years, the striking visual appearance of breccias {{has made them}} a popular sculptural and architectural material. Breccia was used for column bases in the Minoan palace of Knossos on Crete in about 1800 BC.

25|$|The ancient Mesopotamians {{regarded}} {{the sky as}} a series of domes (usually three, but sometimes seven) covering the flat earth.

The middle dome of heaven was made of saggilmut stone and was the abode of the Igigi. The highest and outermost dome of heaven was made of luludānītu stone and was personified as An, the god of the sky. The celestial bodies were equated with specific deities as well. The planet Venus was believed to be Inanna, the goddess of love, sex, and war. The sun was her brother Utu, the god of justice, and the moon was their father Nanna.|$|E
25|$|Today modern Egyptologists {{evaluate}} Herodotus's and Diodorus's {{stories as}} some sort of defamation, based on both author's contemporary philosophy. Oversized tombs such as the Giza-pyramids must have appalled the Greeks and even the later priests of the New Kingdom, because they surely remembered the heretic pharaoh Akhenaten and his megalomaniac building projects. This extremely negative picture was obviously projected onto Khafra and his daunting pyramid. The view was possibly promoted by the fact, that during Khafra's lifetime the permission of the creation of oversized statues made of <b>precious</b> <b>stone</b> and their displaying at open places in public was limited to the king only. At their lifetime, the Greek authors and mortuary priests and temple priests couldn't explain the impressive monuments and statues of Khafra better than {{as the result of a}} megalomaniac character. These views and resulting stories were avidly snapped up by the Greek historians and so they made their also negative evaluations about Khafra, since scandalous stories were easier to sell to the public than positive (and therefore boring) tales.|$|E

25|$|Nofekh (נֹפֶךְ = in the masoretic text) / Anthrax (in the Septuagint) - while Anthrax {{simply means}} coal (presumably here {{referring}} to the colour of burning coal), the Vulgate here has Carbunculus, {{referring to the}} Carbuncle, which was red. Philo of Alexandria, when writing about this stone, says that it was red. He {{seems to be in}} agreement with Josephus, the LXX, and the Jerusalem Targum, the latter saying that it is כדכדנא, explained by Saadia Gaon as meaning karkand, a red variety of <b>precious</b> <b>stone.</b> Nofekh appears to be a loan word; it may derive from the Egyptian term m-f-k-t, referring to Malachite or Turquoise, both of which are a greenish blue; it may instead derive from lupakku, a term appearing in the Amarna letters, referring to a mineral of unknown colour which was sent in tribute to Akhnaten from Ashkalon. In classical rabbinical literature there is some debate between whether Nofekh was red or greenish blue; Exodus Rabbah and the second Jerusalem Targum favour it being red, while the Babylonian Targum and first Jerusalem Targum favour it being green.|$|E
25|$|Today Egyptologists {{evaluate}} Herodotus's and Diodorus's {{stories as}} some sort of defamation, based on both authors' contemporary philosophy. They also call for caution against the credibility of the ancient traditions. They argue that the classical authors lived around 2000 years after Khufu and their sources that were available in their lifetimes surely were antiquated. Additionally the Egyptologists point out that the philosophies of the ancient Egyptians had completely changed since the Old Kingdom. Oversized tombs such as the Giza pyramids must have appalled the Greeks and even the later priests of the New Kingdom, because they surely remembered the heretic pharaoh Akhenaten and his megalomaniac building projects.

As the [...] "'most <b>precious...</b> <b>stone</b> {{in the setting}} of the diadem' from the art treasures of 'Prussia Germany'", Nefertiti would re-establish the imperial German national identity after 1918.

By the 1970s, the bust had become an issue of national identity to both German states—East Germany and West Germany—created after World War II. In 1999, Nefertiti appeared on an election poster for the green political party Bündnis 90/Die Grünen as a promise for cosmopolitan and multi-cultural environment with the slogan [...] "Strong Women for Berlin!" [...] According to Claudia Breger, another reason that the Nefertiti bust became associated with a German national identity was its place as a rival to the Tutankhamun find by the British, who then ruled Egypt.|$|E
500|$|The {{overcoming}} {{of greed}} and selfishness {{has been seen}} as the central moral of the story. Whilst greed is a recurring theme in the novel, with many of the episodes stemming from {{one or more of the}} characters' simple desire for food (be it trolls eating dwarves or dwarves eating Wood-elf fare) or a desire for beautiful objects, such as gold and jewels, it is only by the Arkenstone's influence upon Thorin that greed, and its attendant vices [...] "coveting" [...] and [...] "malignancy", come fully to the fore in the story and provide the moral crux of the tale. Bilbo steals the Arkenstone—a most ancient relic of the dwarves—and attempts to ransom it to Thorin for peace. However, Thorin turns on the Hobbit as a traitor, disregarding all the promises and [...] "at your services" [...] he had previously bestowed. In the end Bilbo gives up the <b>precious</b> <b>stone</b> and most of his share of the treasure to help those in greater need. Tolkien also explores the motif of jewels that inspire intense greed that corrupts those who covet them in the Silmarillion, and there are connections between the words [...] "Arkenstone" [...] and [...] "Silmaril" [...] in Tolkien's invented etymologies.|$|E
