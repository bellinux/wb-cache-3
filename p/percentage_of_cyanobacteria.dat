40|$|Aim:The rapid {{spread of}} {{cyanobacteria}} in water sources and reservoirs has caused serious environmental damage {{and public health}} problems, and consists in a problem that challenges the institutions responsible for providing water to the population. In this study, the quantification of microcystin, saxitoxins and cyanobacteria levels was performed over 3 years in the semi-arid reservoirs of Rio Grande do Norte (Brazil). In addition, we analyzed the seasonal distribution of cyanotoxins and the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>cyanobacteria</b> and cyanotoxins which were above the limit established by Brazilian law. MethodsThe study was conducted between 2009 and 2011 in four dams with six sites: Armando Ribeiro Gonçalves (ARG) in Itajá, San Rafael (SR) and Jucurutu; Passagem das Traíras (PT); Itans and Gargalheiras (GARG). Cyanobacteria presence were quantified and identified {{and the presence of}} microcystins (MCYs) and saxitoxins (STXs) was investigated by ELISA. ResultsThe densities of cyanobacteria were found to be above the permitted in 76 % of cases. The ELISA results showed that of the 128 samples analyzed, 27 % were above the maximum allowed by the Brazilian Ministry of Health Order 2914 / 2011. A seasonal pattern for the presence of MCYs was found (0. 00227 to 24. 1954 µg. L– 1), with the highest values in the rainy season. There was no clear seasonal pattern for STXs (0. 003 to 0. 766 µg. L– 1). ConclusionsThis study showed the importance of establishing a water quality monitoring for human consumption and its potability standards since the concentration of MCYs in some samples was above the maximum limit allowed by Brazilian law, thus posing a risk to public health since the conventional water treatment is not able to eliminate these potent hepatotoxins...|$|E
40|$|The {{vertical}} distribution of phytoplankton was studied in 16 mesotrophic to slightly eutrophic, small and usually dimictic lakes in north-eastern Germany in 1996. All lakes {{were characterized by}} an anaerobic hypolimnion in summer. 14 lakes had a total phosphorus concentration > 20 µg l- 1 in the summer chemocline and were characterized by a deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) in that layer. Two lakes with lower total phosphorus concentration in the chemocline had no DCM. The DCM {{was caused by the}} high biovolume of populations from a group of 11 different cyanobacterial or cryptophyte species that were never observed in the epilimnion. Pseudanabaena catenata and Cryptomonas phaseolus were most widespread in the chemocline. The DCM was in contact with sulphide. Algal biomass in the chemocline was positively correlated with total phosphorus concentration in the chemocline. The <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> the biovolume <b>of</b> filamentous <b>cyanobacteria</b> in the chemocline increased with increasing total phosphorus concentration, reaching 100 % when the P concentration was > 60 µg l- 1. The biovolume of cryptophytes reached higher percentage only at lower P concentration. When the light supply of the chemocline was above average of the studied lakes however, the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> filamentous <b>cyanobacteria</b> was lower than predicted from P concentration and cryptophytes were codominant...|$|R
40|$|Photosynthetic {{microbial}} biofilms are {{an important}} functional component of rocky intertidal habitats worldwide. The abundance of organisms within these films varies both seasonally and according to vertical emersion gradients. However, the effects of horizontal gradients of wave exposure, which have a key influence on macrobiotic assemblages, have received little attention. Here, we examine {{the relative importance of}} exposure to wave action, tidal elevation and season on intertidal microbial assemblages. The abundance of micro-organisms was quantified using counts of major functional groups and total photosynthetic biomass, assessed using extracted chlorophyll. These data were compared between 2 moderately exposed and 2 sheltered shores on replicated sampling dates during summer and winter at 3 tidal levels. Diatoms were approximately 6 times more abundant on moderately exposed shores than on sheltered shores. This pattern was consistent between sites and seasons. The <b>percentage</b> cover <b>of</b> <b>cyanobacteria</b> and total photosynthetic biomass was also typically greater on exposed shores. Seasonal variations were also apparent with a trend of greater photosynthetic microbial biomass during the winter than during the summer. Photosynthetic biomass and, to a lesser extent, the abundance <b>of</b> <b>cyanobacteria</b> were greater on the lower shore than on the upper shore. The possible causes of the differences in microbial assemblages between sheltered and exposed shores are discussed. We suggest that indirect effects of habitat amelioration from macroalgal canopy and grazer density, which also covary along the wave exposure gradient, may be more important than the direct effects of wave action itself...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{influence}} of soil pH was evaluated on the abundance and generic diversity <b>of</b> <b>cyanobacteria</b> in soil samples collected from diverse rice soil ecologies of India. Qualitative and quantitative {{studies of the}} 52 soil samples collected from nine agroecologies was carried out using enrichment, MPN (Most Probable Number) techniques and diversity indices were measured. A total of 166 forms, including 130 heterocystous and 36 non-heterocystous isolates were isolated and the highest <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> abundance of heterocystous forms was observed at pH of 8. 1. Highest Shannon’s diversity index was recorded at a pH of 6. 9, followed by pH of 7. 4, while indices of richness and evenness (J and E) were highest in soil samples of pH of 9. 3. This study highlighted the successful colonization <b>of</b> <b>cyanobacteria</b> in rice field soils of diverse pH {{and the need for}} enrichment of the native flora as a means of exploiting the full potential of cyanobacterial biofertilizers in agricultur...|$|R
