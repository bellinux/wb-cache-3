50|$|<b>Pholedrine</b> (Paredrinol, Pulsotyl, Veritol), {{also known}} as 4-hydroxy-N-methylamphetamine (4-HMA), 4-hydroxymethamphetamine, and para-hydroxymethamphetamine, is a drug that stimulates the {{sympathetic}} nervous system. It is administered as a topical eye drop form {{for the purpose of}} dilating the pupil and can be used to diagnose Horners syndrome.|$|E
40|$|Mydriatic {{responses}} to eyedrops containing the indirect acting sympathomimetic amines tyramine, hydroxyamphetamine, and <b>pholedrine</b> have been compared in 10 healthy subjects. <b>Pholedrine,</b> the n-methyl derivative of hydroxyamphetamine, at {{a concentration of}} 1 % had effects similar to those produced by 0. 5 % hydroxyamphetamine itself. Pretreatment with topical guanethidine attenuated its responses and in 13 patients with unilateral Horner's syndrome it distinguished clearly those five patients who had preganglionic from the eight with postganglionic lesions. It is concluded that 1 % <b>pholedrine</b> may be substituted for 0. 5 % hydroxyamphetamine, which is no longer available, as a diagnostic agent for use in Horner's syndrome...|$|E
40|$|When {{trying to}} {{establish}} the likely anatomical site (preganglionic or postganglionic) of a lesion causing congenital Horner's syndrome, the distribution of facial flushing (the "harlequin" sign), may be seen. In babies and young children, facial flushing is a relatively simple clinical sign to demonstrate, compared with facial sweating. In unilateral facial flushing the areas that do not flush are almost always identical to the anhidrotic areas. However, neither facial flushing nor testing the pupil reactions with <b>pholedrine</b> or hydroxyamphetamine can be relied on to predict the probable site of any lesion causing congenital Horner's syndrome. Two patients with congenital Horner's syndrome are presented which demonstrated the "harlequin" sign and in whom clinical examination and pharmacological testing gave conflicting evidence for localisation of {{the site of the}} causative lesion. The presentation of congenital Horner's syndrome should be investigated and include MRI or CT to exclude a serious underlying cause...|$|E
