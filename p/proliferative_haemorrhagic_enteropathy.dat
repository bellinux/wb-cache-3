40|$|IN a {{previous}} communication, we {{have described the}} principal characters {{of a number of}} strains of Campylobacter sputorum originating from the intestinal mucosa of cases of porcine intestinal adenomatosis (Lawson, Rowland and Wooding, 1975 ~). The number of organisms examined in our initial work was necessarily restricted. In an examination of 10 normal pigs, {{it was not possible to}} recover C. sputorum from the intestinal sites at which adenomatosis commonly occurs or from the intestinal contents (Lawson and Rowland, 1974). Porcine intestinal adenomatosis (PIA), necrotic enteritis (NE), regional ileitis (RI) and <b>proliferative</b> <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>enteropathy</b> (PHE) all have a common morphological basis; organisms that could not be differentiated from C. sputorum subspecies mucosalis have been isolated from pigs with the first three of these conditions (Rowland and Lawson, 1975). The present communication compares, in detail, rnucosalis strains from adenomatous tissue with strains isolated from pigs with NE or RI and also from the oral cavit...|$|E
40|$|The porcine proliferative enteropathies (PPE) are a {{group of}} {{diseases}} ranging from intestinal adenomatosis (PIA), a chronic condition causing reduced growth rates in post weaning pigs, to the often fatal <b>proliferative</b> <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>enteropathy</b> (PHE), resulting in intestinal haemorrhage. PHE predominantly occurs in older and heavier pigs than the chronic disease PIA. This thesis examined whether the age when susceptible pigs are infected affects the clinical response to L. intracellularis infection. The characteristic pathologic lesion of PPE is the abnormal proliferation of crypt epithelial cells in the ileum and colon. Closely associated with this proliferation is the presence of an obligately intracellular bacterium, Lawsonia intracellularis. Characterisation of L. intracellularis was performed in in-vitro co-cultures of L. intracellularis extracted from PHE-affected mucosa. The efficacy of antimicrobials to inhibit the growth of L. intracellularis in-vitro was evaluated and compared with isolates cultured in the United Kingdom. The results were analysed with respect to medication strategies currently used to control PPE in piggeries. PPE occurs in virtually all piggery management systems, including newly developed systems that are aimed at improving the herd health, such as segregated early weaning and multiple site production. PPE is currently controlled in Australia with the routine addition of antimicrobials in pig feed, in particular olaquindox. Recommendations to reduce the use of feed-based antibiotics in Australia require the development of alternate strategies to control diseases such as PPE. Sequential outbreaks of PHE reported in minimal disease herds suggested that pigs could develop immunity to disease. An experimental model of L. intracellularis infection was developed in this thesis to demonstrate that immunity to re-infection with L. intracellularis could be developed. Infection was monitored by detection of faecal shedding of L. intracellularis and serum IgG antibodies against L. intracellularis. Two in-feed antimicrobial strategies were analysed in this thesis for their ability to induce the development of immunity to L. intracellularis, while avoiding clinical signs of disease. The first strategy evaluated the use of low levels of in-feed antimicrobials to allow subclinical infection and the development of immunity. The second strategy evaluated the use of high levels of in-feed antimicrobials to terminate infection two weeks after exposure to L. intracellularis. Gaining a greater understanding of how L. intracellularis infection is spread both within and between piggeries will enable the development of management strategies to control the spread of infection. This thesis examined the possibility that other species in contact with pigs and piggeries such as rats, mice and birds may transmit infection to pigs. The transmission of infection between pigs via the faecal/oral route was also examined, as was the survival and infectivity of L. intracellularis over time. Ultimately this thesis aimed to understand the pattern of L. intracellularis infection and the survival and transmission of L. intracellularis in order to develop effective control measures for PPE, especially in minimal disease herds...|$|E
40|$|The {{extent of}} {{clinical}} or subclinical infection associated with Lawsonia intracellularis within Dutch pig herds was uncertain. A case-control study of slaughter age pigs {{was used to}} study natural infection within Dutch herds and to compare diagnostic methods. From six case herds where clinical disease had been identified recently, and six disease-free herds, 40 pigs of slaughter-age were examined postmortem. The diagnostic methods used were: serology, gross examination, Haematoxylin and Eosin stain (HE), Warthin-Starry silver stain, Lawsonia-specific indirect immunoperoxidase of the ileum, and PCR of ileum mucosa and colon contents. There were 59 % seropositive pigs in case herds and 26 % seropositive pigs in control herds. Using immunohistochemistry, 57 % of case herds and 46 % of control herds were bacteria positive in the ileum mucosa. It was concluded {{that a majority of}} Dutch herds contain L. intracellularis infected finisher pigs. In some herds this is associated with clinical outbreaks of acute <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>enteropathy</b> but in other herds no clinical disease is apparent. Many seropositive pigs in herds without clinical disease had evidence of Lawsonia antigen in sites other than the apical cytoplasm of proliferating epithelial cells, particularly the supranuclear region. It was uncertain whether to classify these pigs as having "recovered" from an infection or whether they have a sub-clinical or chronic form of the disease. We concluded that PCR examination of faeces and serology probably provide more specific results than gross examinations at slaughter, and that a monoclonal antibody-based examination of ileum mucosa should be the accepted screening method for this infection.
