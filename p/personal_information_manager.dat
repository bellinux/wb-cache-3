40|$|The {{advent of}} the World-Wide Web brought with it a {{proliferation}} of information from e-mail, forums, chat, sites that rapidly led to information overload and a subsequent storage problem and maintenance on users’ personal computers. The desktop has become a repository of data that hosts various types of files. The recent massive increase in data {{has resulted in a}} continuous attempt to enhance our data organisation techniques and hence to the development of <b>personal</b> <b>information</b> management software. In this paper we present an overview of data organisation techniques related to personal data management that have been an active research area for decades. We will look at how <b>personal</b> <b>information</b> <b>managers</b> handle different types of files, and abstract these file types into a single user inter- face. Despite their advanced user interfaces, we argue that traditional <b>personal</b> <b>information</b> <b>managers</b> tend to be very domain specific and lack in user adaptability. To address these limitations we propose a semantic desktop application that exploits the flexibility of semantic web technologies, and introduces the concept of a Personal Ontology to aid in data organisation and can be used by other desktop applications such as information retrieval and intelligent software agents. peer-reviewe...|$|R

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of applications, such as electronic mail servers, web servers, and <b>personal</b> <b>information</b> <b>managers,</b> handle large amounts of homogeneous data. This data can be e#ectively represented as records and manipulated through simple operations, e. g., record reading, writing, and searching. Unfortunately, modern storage systems are inappropriate {{for the needs of}} these applications. On one side, file systems store only unstructured data (byte strings) with very limited reliability guarantees. On the other side, relational databases store structured data and provide both concurrency control and transactions; but relational databases are often too slow, complex, and di#cult to manage for many applications. This paper presents a transactional record store that directly addresses the needs of modern applications. The store combines the simplicity and manageability of the file system interface with a select few features for managing record-oriented data. We describe the principles [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Personal</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Managers</b> {{exploit the}} {{ubiquitous}} paradigm in mobile computing technology to integrate services and programs {{for business and}} leisure. Recognizing that every situation is constituted by information and events, this context will {{vary depending on the}} situation users are in, and the tasks they are about to commit. The value of context as a source of information is highly recognized and for individual dimensions context has been both conceptually described and prototypes implemented. The novelty in this paper is a new implementation of context by integrating three dimensions of context: social information, activity information and geographical position. Based on an application developed for Microsoft Window Mobile these three dimensions of context are explored and implemented in an application for mobile telephone users. Experiment conducted show the viability of tailoring contextual information in three dimensions to provide user with timely and relevant information...|$|R

This is precisely the focus of our article. We explain the research issues addressed in a Ph. D. workshop recently held at the ACM Conference on Information and Knowledge Management. This workshop had presentations on novel ideas addressing challenges in information and knowledge management. It covered a broad range of topics such as XML architectures, sensor data streams, <b>personal</b> <b>information</b> <b>managers</b> and text pre-processing.

40|$|More and more, mobile devices act as <b>personal</b> <b>{{information}}</b> <b>managers</b> and {{are able}} to obtain rich contextual information on the user’s environment. Mobile, context-aware web applications can exploit this information to better address the needs of mobile users. Currently, such websites are either developed separately from their associated desktop-oriented version, or both versions are created simultaneously by employing methodologies that support multi-platform context-aware websites, requiring an extensive engineering effort. While these approaches provide a solution for developing new websites, they go past the plethora of existing websites. To address this issue, we present an approach for enhancing existing websites on-the-fly with context-aware features. We first discuss the requirements for such an adaptation process, and identify applicable adaptation methods to realize context-aware features. Next, we explain our generic approach, which is grounded in the use of semantic information extracted from existing websites. Finally, we present a concrete application of our approach that is based on the SCOUT framework for mobile and context-aware application development...|$|R

Nowhere was this {{more evident than}} during this years PC Expo, where {{for the first time}} it looks as if desktop PC’s took a back seat to the latest {{mobile computing}} device technologies. These technologies range from "stick-of-gum " sized memory modules for use in portable devices to digital cameras, MP 3 players, and of course, handheld computers. The latter, also referred to as personal digital assistants (PDAs), <b>personal</b> <b>information</b> <b>managers</b> (PIMs), or palm-sized PC’s, have enjoyed a particularly large part of the computing spotlight this year. With recent announcements from big names such as Sony, Samsung, and AOL, it seems as though everyone is trying to grab a slice of the handheld pie. Because of this growing interest, it is more important than ever to address the major usability issues that stem from using these type of devices.

50|$|The early 1990s {{marked the}} advent of online diary planners. On the face of it, it seems that people who must attend countless {{meetings}} {{are the ones who}} need online diary planners the most. However, actual trends show that those who are in the habit of recording and chronicling their activities all the time are the real takers and users of online diary planners. Such people may be executives, event managers, doctors, students, and people from various walks of life. Terminally ill patients have often taken to writing online diaries. Through the medium of such online diaries, they have kept millions of others in the know of their personal plans, thoughts, their medical treatment procedures, etc. Since all sorts of people have been using online diary planners since their advent in the 1990s, the demand for perfect online organizers and <b>personal</b> <b>information</b> <b>managers</b> (PIMS) has been growing steadily with time. Initially, web-based Filofax came into being to satisfy the organizing need of users. But such applications had their disadvantages. This forced users to turn to solutions like ACT!, Time and Chaos. As these too did not prove to be adequate, those in need of online diary planners started looking towards Microsoft Outlook.|$|R
40|$|Mobile {{computing}} devices, {{which are}} {{commonly known as}} either personal digital assistants (PDA) or <b>personal</b> <b>information</b> <b>managers</b> (PIM), are an emerging technology that {{has the potential to be}} very useful in specific areas of computing. One area in which mobile computing devices are gaining favor is in data collection, especially in places where larger computers are impractical. While the use of these devices as a data collection tool is not a new idea (see Drury, 1987), it has been a bit slow to take off. However, recent advances in this area of technology have allowed the gap in functionality between mobile computing devices and personal computers to be closed to such an extent that these devices may be considered to be as functional in many ways as a laptop or palmtop computer for collecting data. In fact, the conversion of paper and pencil forms such as surveys, questionnaires, and assessments to these devices may be considered a next logical step in the use of mobile computing devices. In order to expand the functionality of mobile computing devices, SURL, along with the Kinesiology and Sport Sciences (KSS) department at Wichita State University has been involved in the process of modifying their current paper and pencil fitness assessment forms to work with the confines of 3 Com Palm PilotTM (Palm).
