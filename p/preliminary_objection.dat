This hearing over five days took place in July. Delay and elaborate review of the law throughout history, taking account of other wars, civil wars and revolutions was a tactic specifically used. A most detailed review of {{the conditions in which}} prisoners were held in custody was cited. A red herring by Comyn drew mention to a link to Comyns Digest of the 18th century and where to place the apostrophe. On 28 July 1921 (only 10 weeks from the original trial by Military Court), Their Lordships, 4 from Scotland and Lord Atkinson from Ireland, gave judgment, which was most unsatisfactory. James Comyn, QC, (nephew of Michael Comyn KC) writes [...] "On the strongly argued <b>Preliminary</b> <b>objection</b> that no appeal lay from Mr. Justice Powell or to them, they ruled against and against the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal.... They went on to hold that Prohibition was inappropriate because first, the Military Court was not a judicial tribunal and secondly, the officers constituting it were functi officio. They refrained from saying too much about the merits of the case because the use of habeas corpus might be attempted".|$|E
5000|$|Ten days later, 10 May 1921, Mr. Justice Powell {{sought a}} Writ of Prohibition against Sir Nevil Macready and General Strickland to {{prohibit}} them; [...] "(1) from further proceeding {{the trial of}} applicants, (2) from pronouncing or confirming any judgment upon them, (3) from carrying any judgment upon them into execution and (4) from otherwise interfering with them". The Prohibition sought was that the Military Court was in fact illegal and therefore had no jurisdiction to try the applicants or to adjudicate in any matter related to them. Mr. Justice Powell listened to this unusual application in his division but [...] "felt constrained to dismiss it". In the appeal to the Court of Appeal - the Crowns case was that the <b>Preliminary</b> <b>objection</b> that Mr. Justice Powells order was [...] "made in a criminal cause or matter within s.50 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act, 1877, therefore no appeal lay. [...] "This contention succeeded with OConnor, M.R., and Lord Justices Ronan and OConnel, and the appeal was duly dismissed".

However, the Court, while rejecting this objection, said that though it is undoubtedly true that the petitioner could have applied for amendment of the writ petition so as to include a claim for compensation but merely because he did not do so, the applications for compensation cannot be thrown out.

50|$|It {{seems that}} the {{question}} is not just failure to tell the truth, that determines the materiality of the statement. Even acts of a witness which obstructed proceeding during cross-examination, may be held to be material. In Millward, where a police officer denied having sought the assistance of his colleague in identifying in the court room a person charged with driving offences, that act was held by the English Court of Appeal as material statement in that it brought to a halt a line of cross-examination, went {{to the heart of the}} case, in that the stopping of the cross-examination might very have affected the outcome of the case. However, questions asked during cross-examination, which purpose is to impugn the credibility of a witness as to his previous convictions have been held not to be material. In R v Griepe, accused gave evidence on behalf of the Crown in 1970 on a <b>preliminary</b> <b>objection</b> into a charge of blackmail. The counsel to the alleged blackmailer asked the accused questions as to his credit with regard to his previous convictions between the year 1947 and 1950, which the accused denied but later admitted. The accused was subsequently charged with perjury relating to his evidence at the Magistrate Court in the proceedings for blackmail. The court inter-alia held that the answers given by the accused relating to those convictions not being relevant to those proceedings could not form the basis of a prosecution for perjury.|$|E

40|$|Las Hermanas Serrano Cruz is a {{landmark}} {{case in the}} jurisprudence of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights because it excludes {{a large body of}} arguably valid claims from meaningful adjudication within the inter-American system. In the Las Hermanas Serrano Cruz decision on <b>preliminary</b> <b>objections,</b> the Court upheld El Salvador’s restriction to rationae temporis. Although the State’s restriction was improper both substantively and procedurally, the Court held it to be valid under the American Convention on Human Rights by misclassifying it as a declaration rather than a reservation. This mistake not only proved detrimental to the Las Hermanas Serrano Cruz decision, but also to the future of human rights claims within the inter-American system. This paper will closely evaluate the inconsistencies within the Court’s reasoning, and suggest that at a minimum, the Court amend its procedural allowances for reservations and declarations. In the preferred alternative, serious consideration should be given to prohibiting reservations and declarations to the American Convention in their entirety...|$|R
5000|$|The Florence Prosecution office accused Mignini {{of taking}} part in forging a fake audio recording, of abusing his powers as he {{investigated}} the head of Florentine police Giuseppe De Donno, and for having wiretapped phone calls of three journalists and two police officers, allegedly for unjustified reasons. Mignini objected that the Florence Magistrates had no jurisdiction on him because of their office's conflict of interest and requested that the investigation be moved to Turin. Preliminary judge Dania Mori turned down his request. In January 2010, a Florence court chaired by judge Francesco Maradei acquitted him {{of the first three}} counts of fabricating fake evidence, as Mignini and Giuttari managed do prove that the audio recording was authentic, but found him guilty of the remaining four counts of exceeding the powers of his office. [...] He was given a 16-month suspended sentence. Mignini appealed the conviction, saying [...] "My conscience is clear, I know I did nothing wrong." [...] He remained in office through the appeal process, as Italian law does not consider convictions final until all appeals are exhausted, but delayed taking a post at the Procura Generale where he had been already appointed. [...] According to Rome-based journalist and author Barbie Latza Nadeau, even if Mignini were convicted, offenses such as this are rarely grounds for removing a prosecutor from office. In November 2011, a Court of Appeals accepted his <b>preliminary</b> <b>objection</b> and annulled the previous conviction, also declaring the prosecution by Florentine magistrates illegitimate - since some of the Florence prosecutors were also the offended parties - and sent the investigation file to a prosecutor in Turin. The Prosecution General of Florence appealed against the decision at the Supreme Court, so factually blocking the transfer to Turin for at least another year. In February 2013 the Florence office lost their appeal and the Supreme Court ordered the investigation be moved to Turin. Mignini said [...] "It took me 7 years to be right" [...] In 2016, the court of Turin dropped the remaining charges due to statutory terms expiration.|$|E
40|$|With {{the aim of}} barring the Nicaragua’s fresh {{request for}} the {{delimitation}} of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles, Colombia {{raised the issue of}} the res judicata effect of the previous decision of 2012, rendered in the Territorial and Maritime Dispute, whereby the ICJ had apparently settled the case and dismissed on the merits the same request. In the Judgment on preliminary objections of 2016, relating to the “new” case Question of the Delimitation of the Continental Shelf between Nicaragua and Colombia beyond 200 nautical miles from the Nicaraguan Coast, the ICJ held that no binding force attached to the operative part of the 2012 ruling. The outcome of the incidental proceedings was not predictable as one might have expected, given that the decision was taken with the casting vote of the President and prompted a strong dissent among some judges. This occurrence gives a clear evidence on the interplay between several intertwined issues of international law, which the majority was called to deal with and balance in the present case, such as the interpretation of Article 76, paragraph 8 of the UNCLOS, the principles of res judicata and jurisdiction ratione materiae and the duty to give reasons. The article aims to demonstrate that the Court dismissed Colombia’s third <b>preliminary</b> <b>objection</b> for underlying reasons of judicial policy, namely to secure its previous judgment of 2012 from any potential claim relating to inadequate reasoning, if construed as a final rejection on the merits...|$|E
40|$|Legal and {{political}} analyses tend {{to downplay the}} problem of spatiality evoked {{in the notion of}} an Area of Freedom, Security and Justice, focusing instead on the dis-tinct policy fields covered by this triad of values. Whatever its merits, this analytic strategy neglects the central claim hidden in what seems to be but a flatulent title: the closure of space into a legal place, into a bounded region, is ingredient to the very possibility and concrete realization of freedom, security and justice. This paper explores this claim in four stages. Initially it examines and rejects the <b>preliminary</b> <b>objection</b> that globalisation marks the irreversible decline of legal place as a consti-tutive feature of social life. Then it develops a legal topology of the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice, arguing that two different modes of the inside/outside distinc-tion are at stake in Articles 61 and 63 ECT. Subsequently, drawing on Communica-tion 459 / 98 and the Preambles to the Treaties, the paper outlines a topogenesis of the Area, describing the representational process by which its boundaries are pos-ited. The paper concludes by asserting that the primacy of security over freedom and justice is related to the paradox governing a fledgling European public order: in the process of enforcing the Union’s claim to an own place, the Area of Freedom, Secu-rity and Justice becomes unrecognisable as the Union’s own place.

Nozick favors a [...] "Lockean" [...] proviso that forbids appropriation when the position of others is thereby worsened. For instance, appropriating the only water hole in a desert and charging monopoly prices would not be legitimate. But in line with his endorsement of the historical principle, this argument does not apply to the medical researcher who discovers a cure for a disease and sells for whatever price he will. Nor does Nozick provide any means or theory whereby abuses of appropriation—acquisition of property when there is not enough and as good in common for others—should be corrected.|$|R

This form of interpretation, according to which “the fact that a provision expressly provides for one category of situations is said to justify the inference that other comparable categories are excluded”, has been addressed several times in the jurisprudence of the Court and its predecessor, the Permanent Court of International Justice (“PCIJ”). Yet, despite assertions that the maxim of interpretation would “find a place in the logic of the nursery”, there remain fundamental questions about both its character and its operation.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} addresses {{whether and}} to what extent constitutions, and their constitutional law more generally, make provision for secession. More broadly put, the question is what place secession has, or should have under municipal constitutional law. The two aspects of the question naturally are different in focus and intent. Whether secession has a place under any constitutional system depends very much on the text of any given constitutional document and the current body of constitutional law and norms. It is principally a factual enquiry, a matter for descriptive jurisprudence. Whether secession should figure in some way in a constitution or the constitutional law and norms is more speculative an enquiry, bordering on politics, legal theory, constitutional theory, and like matters, and pertains more to analytic jurisprudence. The two are nonetheless conjoined inasmuch as the subsuming of secession under a constitutional system in the absence of express provisions therefor depends in a large measure on what analytic stance we take on constitutional and legal theory, and on what a constitution, generally and in particular, should address. Now obviously, the two sides of this single issues are related, insofar as the first draws upon norms and principles to inform – implicitly – constitutional and relevant law, and the second upon the constitution and law as practical framework or instantiation of the norms and principles. This suggests that in constitutional theory, secession should be conceived less as purely some institutional re-arranging inside or outside the current institutional and regulatory framework. Similarly, a constitution should be conceived less as purely a template or map of state, and more as institutional architecture, namely the building of institutions to strengthen and develop the moral foundations of a society. We take the position in this thesis that secession is indeed a matter appropriate for constitutional law, and is governed thereby. Whilst secession provisions are not and should not be incorporated expressly into a constitution the process of secession is certainly subject to constitutional law and norms. Some inroad to a full grasp of this position (but not its implications) has already been forged by the Supreme Court of Canada, in the Québec Secession Reference. As such, and to the extent outlined below, secession, as an element of constitutional law, engages the courts at least on that basis, insofar as their jurisdiction permits. Accordingly, secession is more than a purely political (TABLE OF CONTENTS Volume 1 Foreword	 i Table of Contents 	 ii Samenvatting	 vii Chapter 1 THE JUSTICIABILITY OF SECESSION? 1.

40|$|The {{judgment}} of the International Court of Justice of 3 February 2015 delivered in the dispute between Croatia and Serbia calls for a careful analysis of some procedural matters which the Court was faced with, such as {{the interpretation of the}} subject-matter of a dispute and the function and limits of compromissory clauses. By giving a very wide interpretation of the term “responsibility” couched in Article IX of the Genocide Convention, the Court basically applied the Convention to ascertain whether an act of genocide occurred prior to April 27, 1992, the day of the proclamation of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, even if this State did not yet exist before that date. The present article analyzes the rationale of the Court’s legal reasoning in light of the {{judgment of}} 2008 on <b>preliminary</b> <b>objections</b> and of other relevant precedents of the Court on similar disputes. It explores the underlying reasons of judicial policy which led the Court to broaden its jurisdiction {{to the detriment of the}} traditional “meticulous” construction of compromissory clause...|$|R
5000|$|With his ABA career over {{following}} {{the playoffs in}} 1972, Strom contacted Nucatola to get an NBA contract signed for the 1972-73 NBA season. Nucatola told Strom to call back after {{the conclusion of the}} 1972 NBA Playoffs. Strom called Nucatola {{following the}} NBA playoffs, but was told to [...] "wait a little longer." [...] Strom continued to have difficulties with Nucatola {{over the next several months}} and finally sought the assistance of Richie Phillips, a Philadelphia attorney and NBA player representative. Strom filed a $275,000 suit against the NBA in December 1972 for breach of an oral contract when John Nucatola told Strom that he could return to the league. The league filed <b>preliminary</b> <b>objections</b> to have the suit dismissed, but were overruled by the court. The NBA then moved for summary judgment which was denied. Concerned that there could be legitimate action taken, the NBA decided to give Strom his job back if he dropped the suit. Strom agreed to the terms and signed a contract before the start of the 1973-74 NBA season.|$|R
50|$|In 2008, {{a similar}} {{adaptation}} titled West Africa's Next Top Model was planned {{and would have}} featured contestants originating from the West African countries of Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Senegal, Liberia and Nigeria. The competition was also supposed to be hosted by Oluchi Onweagba. Auditions began in March 2009, but due to unknown reasons, the series was left without a station and never aired, and no contestants were selected. On February 12, 2016, a federal high court in Abuja dismissed <b>preliminary</b> <b>objections</b> regarding a ₦780 billion copyright lawsuit by Chudi Charles, CEO of International Pageant and Films, against Onweagba for infringing his West Africa's Next Top Model trademark, which he had registered in 2003; After filing the lawsuit against Onweagba, {{as well as the}} Nigerian Copyright Commission, Etisalat Nigeria, Guinness Nigeria Plc, Mtech, Multichoice Nigeria and CBS, Onweagba and the other defendants filed an objection in which they argued that they had obtained the rights to host Africa's Next Top Model from Tyra Banks, the executive producer and host of America's Next Top Model. The objection was dismissed after the defendants were unable to produce a superior title to back up their claims of ownership.|$|R
5000|$|In 2001, Nicaragua National Assembly {{declared}} the Barcenas-Esguerra Treaty null because it claimed {{that it was}} signed under pressure of US army occupation (1928-1933). Nicaragua now have signed a treaty of limits with Colombia, and it disputed the limits alleged by Colombia at 82 degrees longitude. In 2007, International Court of Justice said the Treaty signed in 1928 (and the 1930 Protocol of Exchange of Ratifications) are not a Treatry of limits between both nations. Nicaragua filed a formal complaint before the International Court of Justice in The Hague, claiming territory east of longitude 82, because their continental marine platform including sovereignty over the archipelago of San Andrés. On December 13, 2007, the International Court of Justice recognized the full sovereignty of Colombia over the islands of San Andrés, Providencia and Santa Catalina, but left open {{the question about the}} demarcation of the maritime boundary and the sovereignty of one of the two nations over the cays of Serranilla, Quitasueño, Serrana, Roncador and Bajo Nuevos. The ICJ also ruled it [...] "upheld <b>preliminary</b> <b>objections</b> of Colombia to its jurisdiction only insofar as they concerned sovereignty over the islands of San Andrés, Providencia and Santa Catalina".|$|R
40|$|First paragraph: In the {{aftermath}} of the sovereign debt restructuring (SDR) that was implemented by Argentina, aggrieved bondholders who did not accept the conditions of the debt exchange took different legal avenues to recover the amounts invested. Whereas some of them initiated actions before national courts, other investors decided to lodge their complaints with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) and succeeded in obtaining favourable decisions on jurisdiction. Certainly, the claims brought by bondholders under the bilateral investment treaty (BIT) between Argentina and Italy (Abaclat, Ambiente Ufficio and Alemanni) represent {{a turning point in the}} investment arbitration regime. In particular, the Decision on jurisdiction in Abaclat constituted a landmark in ICSID arbitration and a major event in terms of the evolution of foreign investment law (FIL), demonstrating the capacity of the ICSID system to adjust to changing circumstances. The Ambiente Ufficio Tribunal built on this Decision. More recently, on 17 November 2014, the Tribunal in Alemanni issued its Decision on jurisdiction in which it rejected most of the <b>preliminary</b> <b>objections</b> posed by the respondent State and allowed the claim to proceed. Even if this last case involved fewer investors and less money, it contributes to the current scholarly debate regarding ICSID jurisdiction on sovereign debt bonds...|$|R
