25|$|Sir C. P. Ramaswami Iyer {{liquidated}} the Quilon bank, {{and sealed}} off Malayala Manorama the leading news paper for criticizing the divan. Abraham Mar Thoma spoke about these notorious acts and visited {{those who were}} jailed by him. He further visited the Maharaja of Travancore and complaint about Divans tyrannical rule. Marthoma church at this point passed a church resolution against Divan and independent Travancore which infuriated the divan and ordered for the Metropolitans arrest and imprisonment. However the arrest order was not executed. It was all done at a point of time when other churches and communities of Travancore praised divan or feared to utter a word against the divan. Later the Marthoma church had to pay the <b>price</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> social action. The land allotted {{in the heart of}} Thiruvananthapuram to construct a church by Maharaja Sree Moolam Thirunal was taken back. Marthoma church was selectively targeted by Divan, by not giving permissions for construction of cemeteries and new church buildings.|$|E
25|$|Expiry (or Expiration in the U.S.) is {{the time}} and the day that a {{particular}} delivery month of a futures contract stops trading, as well as the final settlement <b>price</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> contract. For many equity index and Interest rate future contracts (as well as for most equity options), this happens on the third Friday of certain trading months. On this day the t+1 futures contract becomes the t futures contract. For example, for most CME and CBOT contracts, at the expiration of the December contract, the March futures become the nearest contract. This is an exciting time for arbitrage desks, which try to make quick profits during the short period (perhaps 30 minutes) during which the underlying cash price and the futures price sometimes struggle to converge. At this moment the futures and the underlying assets are extremely liquid and any disparity between an index and an underlying asset is quickly traded by arbitrageurs. At this moment also, the increase in volume is caused by traders rolling over positions to the next contract or, in the case of equity index futures, purchasing underlying components of those indexes to hedge against current index positions. On the expiry date, a European equity arbitrage trading desk in London or Frankfurt will see positions expire in as many as eight major markets almost every half an hour.|$|E
500|$|Andy Gill of The Independent awarded Born Villain {{their lowest}} rating of one star out of five.

[...] Conversely, a review by Simon <b>Price</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> publication's sister edition, The Independent on Sunday, gave the album their top score of five stars, saying that it [...] "features some of his finest lyrics yet and, musically, it often approaches the heyday of Holy Wood and Mechanical Animals.

500|$|Walras' law was {{introduced}} as a theoretical {{answer to the}} problem of determining the solutions in general equilibrium. [...] His notation is different from modern notation but can be constructed using more modern summation notation. [...] Walras assumed that in equilibrium, all money would be spent on all goods: every good would be sold at the market <b>price</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> good and every buyer would expend their last dollar on a basket of goods. [...] Starting from this assumption, Walras could then show that if there were n markets and n-1 markets cleared (reached equilibrium conditions) that the nth market would clear as well. [...] This is easiest to visualize with two markets (considered in most texts as a market for goods and a market for money). [...] If one of two markets has reached an equilibrium state, no additional goods (or conversely, money) can enter or exit the second market, so it must be in a state of equilibrium as well. [...] Walras used this statement to move toward a proof of existence of solutions to general equilibrium but it is commonly used today to illustrate market clearing in money markets at the undergraduate level.|$|E
2500|$|Immediately after Nixon's {{re-election}} in 1972, {{he called for}} all appointed officials in his administration to resign; Nixon here sought to gain more personal control over the federal government. Helms did not consider his position at CIA {{to be a political}} job, which was the traditional view within the Agency, and so did not resign as DCI. Previously, on election day Helms had lunch with General Alexander Haig, a top Nixon security advisor; Haig didn't know Nixon's mind on the future at CIA. Evidently neither did Henry Kissinger, Helms discovered later. On November 20, Helms came to Camp David to an interview with Nixon about {{what he thought was a}} [...] "budgetary matter". Nixon's chief of staff, H. R. Haldeman also attended. Helms was then informed by Nixon that his services in the new administration would not be required. On Helms' dismissal William Colby (DCI Sept. 1973 to Jan. 1976) later commented that [...] "Dick Helms paid the <b>price</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> 'No' [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|Electricity retailers, who in {{aggregate}} buy from the wholesale market, and generators who {{in aggregate}} {{sell to the}} wholesale market, are exposed to these price and volume effects and {{to protect themselves from}} volatility, they will enter into [...] "hedge contracts" [...] with each other. The structure of these contracts varies by regional market due to different conventions and market structures. However, the two simplest and most common forms are simple fixed price forward contracts for physical delivery and contracts for differences where the parties agree a strike price for defined time periods. In the case of a contract for difference, if a resulting wholesale price index (as referenced in the contract) in any time period is higher than the [...] "strike" [...] price, the generator will refund the difference between the [...] "strike" [...] price and the actual <b>price</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> period. Similarly a retailer will refund the difference to the generator when the actual price is less than the [...] "strike price". The actual price index is sometimes referred to as the [...] "spot" [...] or [...] "pool" [...] price, depending on the market.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{concern is}} that monopolistic {{competition}} fosters advertising {{and the creation of}} brand names. Advertising induces customers into spending more on products because of the name associated with them rather than because of rational factors. Defenders of advertising dispute this, arguing that brand names can represent a guarantee of quality and that advertising helps reduce the cost to consumers of weighing the tradeoffs of numerous competing brands. [...] There are unique information and information processing costs associated with selecting a brand in a monopolistically competitive environment. In a monopoly market, the consumer is faced with a single brand, making information gathering relatively inexpensive. In a perfectly competitive industry, the consumer is faced with many brands, but because the brands are virtually identical information gathering is also relatively inexpensive. In a monopolistically competitive market, the consumer must collect and process information on a large number of different brands to be able to select the best of them. In many cases, the cost of gathering information necessary to selecting the best brand can exceed the benefit of consuming the best brand instead of a randomly selected brand. The result is that the consumer is confused. Some brands gain prestige value and can extract an additional <b>price</b> <b>for</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Former pairing Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez incited {{unprecedented}} {{media attention}} for an American modern-day supercouple during their 2002-2004 courtship. The two {{were referred to}} as the first superstar couple of the Internet age, [...] and the pairing's popularity resulted in their being known by the portmanteau [...] "Bennifer" [...] (for Ben and Jennifer) to the media, as well as to fans using the name combination. The term Bennifer itself became popular, and started the trend of other celebrity couples being referred to by the combination of each other's first names. The pairing eventually succumbed to overexposure, which caused public interest in their romance to result in less admiration and negatively affected their careers. In 2007, Affleck stated: [...] was probably bad for my career. What happens is this sort of bleed-over from the tabloids across your movie work. You go to a movie, you only go once. But the tabloids and Internet are everywhere. You can really subsume the public image of somebody. I ended up in an unfortunate crosshair position where I was in a relationship and [...] mostly lied and inflated a bunch of salacious stuff for the sake of selling magazines. And I paid a certain <b>price</b> <b>for</b> <b>that.</b> Then, in concert with some movies that didn’t work...|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, {{economist}} Jeffrey Sachs said, [...] "My {{concern is}} not {{that there are too}} many sweatshops, but that there are too few." [...] Sachs and other proponents of free trade and the global movement of capital cite the economic theory of comparative advantage, which states that international trade will, in the long run, make all parties better off. The theory holds that developing countries improve their condition by doing something that they do [...] "better" [...] than industrialized nations (in this case, they charge less but do the same work). Developed countries will also be better off because their workers can shift to jobs that they do better. These are jobs that some economists say usually entail a level of education and training that is exceptionally difficult to obtain in the developing world. Thus, economists like Sachs say, developing countries get factories and jobs that they would not otherwise. Some would say with this situation occurs when developing countries try to increase wages because sweatshops tend to just get moved on to a new state that is more welcoming. This leads to a situation where states often don't try to increase wages for sweatshop workers for fear of losing investment and boosted GDP. However, this only means average wages around the world will increase at a steady rate. A nation only gets left behind if it demands wages higher than the current market <b>price</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> labor.|$|E

60|$|When Saturday came, {{the day for}} {{the game}} with Bogg's Farm, a wild protest went up from the boys. Willie {{experienced}} his first bitterness as a manager. Out of forty aspirants for the Madden's Hill team he could choose but nine to play the game. And as a conscientious manager he could use no favorites. Willie picked the best players and assigned them to positions that, in his judgment, were the best suited to them. Bob Irvine wanted to play first base and he was down for right field. Sam Wickhart {{thought he was the}} fastest fielder, and Willie had him slated to catch. Tom Lindsay's feelings were hurt because he was not to play in the infield. Eddie Curtis suffered a fall in pride when he discovered he was not down to play second base. Jake Thomas, Tay-Tay Mohler and Brick Grace all wanted to pitch. The manager had chosen Frank <b>Price</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> important position, and Frank's one ambition was to be a shortstop.|$|E
60|$|The item chiefly disputed in {{this bill}} was the very {{moderate}} charge of two pennies for the dickey.

The elder partner of the firm, however, would allow me only one penny of the charge, and took it upon himself to show in what manner four of the same sized conveniences could be got out of a sheet of foolscap. But it is needless to say that I stood upon the principle of the thing. Business is business, and should be done in a business way. There was no system whatever in swindling me out of a penny--a clear fraud of fifty per cent--no method in any respect. I left at once the employment of Messrs.
