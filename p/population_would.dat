5|$|Every {{species is}} fertile enough {{that if all}} {{offspring}} survived to reproduce, the <b>population</b> <b>would</b> grow (fact).|$|E
5|$|The {{lack of a}} {{permanent}} <b>population</b> <b>would</b> seem to prevent the British overseas territories of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands and British Antarctic Territory, the New Zealand territory of Ross Dependency and the Australian external territories of Australian Antarctic Territory, Ashmore and Cartier Islands, Coral Sea Islands and Heard Island and McDonald Islands from competing.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers {{originally}} {{supposed that}} the entire trans-Neptunian <b>population</b> <b>would</b> show a similar red surface colour, as they were thought to have originated in the same region and subjected to the same physical processes. Specifically, SDOs were expected to have large amounts of surface methane, chemically altered into complex organic molecules by energy from the Sun. This would absorb blue light, creating a reddish hue. Most classical objects display this colour, but scattered objects do not; instead, they present a white or greyish appearance.|$|E
50|$|It {{is unable}} to explain why large {{herbivore}} populations were not regulated by surviving carnivores such as grizzly bears, wolves, pumas, and jaguars whose <b>populations</b> <b>would</b> have increased rapidly {{in response to the}} loss of competitors.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} the 18th century, Thomas Robert Malthus {{concluded}} that, if unchecked, <b>populations</b> <b>would</b> {{be subject}} to exponential growth. He feared that <b>population</b> growth <b>would</b> tend to outstrip growth in food production, leading to ever-increasing famine and poverty (see Malthusian catastrophe). He is seen as the intellectual father of ideas of overpopulation and the limits to growth. Later, more sophisticated and realistic models were presented by Benjamin Gompertz and Verhulst.|$|R
30|$|Moreover, we {{enrolled}} a mixed {{population of}} neurological and non-neurological ICU patients. Indication for tracheostomy and causes of failed weaning may differ {{in these two}} populations. However, demonstration of protocol efficacy in these diverse <b>populations</b> <b>would</b> strengthen generalizability of results.|$|R
5|$|Before 1977, no {{expedition}} {{had been}} to Stewart Island/Rakiura {{to search for the}} bird. In 1977, sightings of kakapo were reported on Stewart Island. An expedition to the island found a track and bowl system on its first day; soon after, it located several dozen kakapo. The finding in an 8,000-hectare area of fire-modified scrubland and forest raised hope that the <b>population</b> <b>would</b> include females. The total population was estimated at 100 to 200 birds.|$|E
5|$|The Voluntary Human Extinction Movement (VHEMT) is an {{environmental}} movement {{that calls for}} all people to abstain from reproduction to cause the gradual voluntary extinction of humankind. VHEMT supports human extinction primarily because, in the group's view, it would prevent environmental degradation. The group states that {{a decrease in the}} human <b>population</b> <b>would</b> prevent a significant amount of human-caused suffering. The extinctions of non-human species and the scarcity of resources required by humans are frequently cited by the group as evidence of the harm caused by human overpopulation.|$|E
5|$|The city of Arlington had a {{population}} of 17,926 people {{at the time of}} the 2010 U.S. census, making it the ninth largest of eighteen cities in Snohomish County. From 1980 to 2010, Arlington's population increased by over 450 percent, fueled by the construction of suburban housing and annexations of outlying areas. The United States Census Bureau estimates the city's 2016 population at 19,112. In 2005, the Arlington city council projected that the city's <b>population</b> <b>would</b> double from 15,000 to 30,528 by 2025.|$|E
50|$|Analysing {{data for}} 40 countries, Lee et al. show that {{fertility}} well above replacement and <b>population</b> growth <b>would</b> typically be most beneficial for government budgets. However, fertility near replacement and <b>population</b> stability <b>would</b> be most beneficial for {{standards of living}} when the analysis includes the effects of age structure on families as well as governments. And fertility moderately below replacement and <b>population</b> decline <b>would</b> maximize standards of living when the cost of providing capital for a growing labour force is taken into account.|$|R
50|$|The Neolithic era {{ushered in}} the first settled {{agricultural}} communities, whose founders had migrated from the Danube River area beginning about 5500 BC. Later, the native post-Mesolithic <b>populations</b> <b>would</b> also adopt and further develop the agricultural way of life (between 4400 and about 2000 BC).|$|R
50|$|The {{study also}} {{concluded}} that, in future testing areas, lethal methods of reducing wolf <b>populations</b> <b>would</b> be minimized, {{as it was}} clearly found during the study that sterilization was far more effective in controlling the population and it also did not affect wolf behavior.|$|R
5|$|After {{three months}} of {{inactivity}} and regrouping, Kagame decided in January 1991 that the RPF was ready to begin fighting again. The target chosen for the first attack was {{the northern city of}} Ruhengeri, which lies immediately south of the Virunga mountains. The city was the best choice from a practical point of view, being the only provincial capital that could be attacked quickly from the Virungas while maintaining an element of surprise. Kagame also favoured an attack on Ruhengeri for cultural reasons. President Habyarimana, as well as his wife and her powerful family, came from the north west of Rwanda and most Rwandans regarded the region was as the heartland of the regime. An attack there guaranteed that the <b>population</b> <b>would</b> become aware of the RPF's presence, and Kagame hoped the attack would destabilise the government.|$|E
5|$|Back in Cuba, Castro feared a U.S.-backed coup; in 1959 {{his regime}} spent $120 million on Soviet, French, and Belgian {{weaponry}} and by early 1960 had doubled {{the size of}} Cuba's armed forces. Fearing counter-revolutionary elements in the army, the government created a People's Militia to arm citizens favorable to the revolution, training at least 50,000 civilians in combat techniques. In September 1960, they created the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (CDR), a nationwide civilian organization which implemented neighborhood spying to detect counter-revolutionary activities as well as organizing health and education campaigns, becoming a conduit for public complaints. By 1970, {{a third of the}} <b>population</b> <b>would</b> be involved in the CDR, and this would come to rise to 80%.|$|E
5|$|Cholesterol {{levels may}} be {{determined}} {{as part of}} health screening for health insurance or occupational health, when the external physical signs such as xanthelasma, xanthoma, arcus are noticed, symptoms of cardiovascular disease develop, or a family member {{has been found to}} have FH. A pattern compatible with hyperlipoproteinemia type IIa on the Fredrickson classification is typically found: raised level of total cholesterol, markedly raised level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), normal level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and normal level of triglycerides. Total cholesterol levels of 350–550 mg/dL are typical of heterozygous FH while total cholesterol levels of 650–1000 mg/dL are typical of homozygous FH. The LDL is typically above the 75th percentile, that is, 75% of the healthy <b>population</b> <b>would</b> have a lower LDL level. Cholesterol levels can be drastically higher in people with FH who are also obese.|$|E
5000|$|They are bred {{in captivity}} for falconry; hybrids with the {{peregrine}} ("perilanners") are also often seen. Merret (1666) {{claimed that the}} [...] "lanar" [...] lived in Sherwood Forest and the Forest of Dean in England; such <b>populations</b> <b>would</b> seem to have derived from escaped hunting birds of the nobility.|$|R
30|$|More {{studies that}} {{document}} {{the success of}} STEM programs with low ability and diverse student <b>populations</b> <b>would</b> be beneficial encouragement to teachers. Teachers need to believe all students can benefit from STEM instruction. As they begin to experience student success in their classrooms, they will be encouraged to continue implementing STEM activities.|$|R
50|$|His {{published}} {{papers are}} primarily {{in regard to}} variable stars and photometry. He is most noted for his 1939 observation that {{there appear to be}} two populations of globular clusters based on the periodicities of their RR Lyrae variable stars. These two <b>populations</b> <b>would</b> {{come to be known as}} Oosterhoff groups after him.|$|R
5|$|Each of the {{proposed}} mechanisms for Sedna's extreme orbit would leave a distinct mark on the structure and dynamics of any wider population. If a trans-Neptunian planet was responsible, all such objects would share roughly the same perihelion (about 80AU). If Sedna were captured from another planetary system that rotated {{in the same direction}} as the Solar System, then all of its <b>population</b> <b>would</b> have orbits on relatively low inclinations and have semi-major axes ranging from 100–500AU. If it rotated in the opposite direction, then two populations would form, one with low and one with high inclinations. The perturbations from passing stars would produce a wide variety of perihelia and inclinations, each dependent on the number and angle of such encounters.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-19thcentury, manor {{owners in}} Estonia found the native Estonian Horse {{too small for}} their {{agricultural}} needs, {{and came to the}} conclusion that the <b>population</b> <b>would</b> benefit from crossbreeding. Finnish horses were among the good quality breeds considered for the job. The state stud farm of Tori was founded as the central base for the new Estonian breed in 1856, and ten Finnish mares and three stallions were bought for its needs. Though some purebred Finnish horses were produced, they were used mainly for crossbreeding; the later offspring of part-Finnish crossbreds, however, did not prove as good as expected, and the Tori stud gradually stopped using Finnish horses. One Finnish-Arabian stallion, Orro, has had noteworthy influence on the modern-day Tori horse, through his widely used great-grandson Harun 42 T.|$|E
5|$|Like other bleeding-hearts, the Sulu bleeding-heart is {{primarily}} a sedentary bird, feeding {{on the forest floor}} and flying only for short distances. Little is known about its behavior due to the paucity of sightings. Searches of Tawi-Tawi in 1971 and 1991 did not discover any evidence of the species' continued existence. Most of the bird's habitat was logged on Tawi-Tawi by 1994. However, an ethnobiological survey in 1995 revealed that the bleeding-heart was common until the 1970s and still survives on small islets near Tawi-Tawi. While another survey in 2009 failed to find the species, there is some hope that it may still persist. For this reason, it is currently listed as critically endangered by the IUCN. Any surviving <b>population</b> <b>would</b> be very small, likely numbering fewer than 50 individuals, and would be threatened by habitat destruction and uncontrolled hunting.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on Yucca brevifolia. Most Tegeticula species, {{including}} T. antithetica, are monophagous, and {{the adult}} moths only live {{for a few}} days, so they must access the plant during the short flowering period. This indicates that moth <b>populations</b> <b>would</b> have to be locally adapted for the flowering periods their specific hosts.|$|R
50|$|The eastern {{tropical}} Pacific and Southeast Asian {{populations of}} the pantropical spotted dolphin are listed in Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). As the pantropical spotted dolphin {{can be divided into}} three subspecies, studies of these distinct <b>populations</b> <b>would</b> be needed to assess conservation efforts.|$|R
50|$|The three {{currently}} recognized subspecies may each {{constitute a}} distinct species. If so, E. ciliatum ssp. watsonii would perhaps use the name E. adenocaulon and include those populations, while E. ciliatum ssp. glandulosum would perhaps use the name E. bergianum and include those populations. The others named E. ciliatum ssp. ciliatum <b>populations</b> <b>would</b> remain.|$|R
5|$|Nonfatal {{health effects}} were {{difficult}} to measure in the smog's immediate aftermath. Some of the health effects were themselves delayed; for example, most of the serious effects on the elderly <b>population</b> <b>would</b> only manifest days after initial exposure. A study on the smog's nonfatal health effects was published in December 1966. The study, conducted by a nonprofit health research group, found that 10 percent of the city's population suffered some negative health effects from the smog, including symptoms like stinging eyes, coughing, wheezing, the coughing-up of phlegm, or difficulty breathing. The director of the research group said anything serious enough to adversely affect as much as 10 percent of the population, like the smog had, indicated {{the existence of a}} serious public health problem.|$|E
5|$|On the {{political}} level, Duhalde's presidency was {{strongly influenced by}} his feud with Menem. Menem wanted to run for a new term as president in the 2003 election, and Duhalde wanted to prevent it. To this purpose, he sought other candidates that may have defeated him. Some of these potential candidates were Carlos Reutemann, José Manuel de la Sota, Mauricio Macri, Adolfo Rodríguez Saá, Felipe Solá and Roberto Lavagna, but none of those negotiations bore fruit. The scandal {{over the death of}} the piqueteros Maximiliano Kosteki and Manuel Santillán in the Avellaneda massacre forced Duhalde to rush the elections by six months. As a result, he chose Néstor Kirchner, governor of Santa Cruz Province, despite his reservations. Kirchner was fifth in the presidential polls, and was mostly unknown by the public. Duhalde speculated that, although Menem had a large number of willing voters to begin with, he was also very unpopular. Thus, Menem might have won the elections but if the results called for a ballotage, most of the <b>population</b> <b>would</b> rally under any candidate with a chance to defeat him.|$|E
5|$|Since {{incorporation}} into Greece {{was not an}} option after the recent political developments, Zografos proposed three main solutions to the representatives of the International Commission: complete autonomy under the sovereignty of the Albanian prince, administrative and canton type autonomy, and direct administration and control by the European Powers. The Northern Epirote side also demanded the extension of the area in which the Greek <b>population</b> <b>would</b> enjoy education in its native language to include the regions around Vlorë and Durrës (in central Albania, to the north of Northern Epirus), the appointment of Greek Orthodox higher officials in the main towns of Northern Epirus and the exemption from military service of the local population, even in time of war.|$|E
5000|$|However, detractors {{argue that}} Milgram's {{experiment}} did not demonstrate such a link, and the [...] "six degrees" [...] claim has been decried as an [...] "academic urban myth". Also, {{the existence of}} isolated groups of humans, for example the Korubo and other native Brazilian <b>populations,</b> <b>would</b> tend to invalidate the strictest interpretation of the hypothesis.|$|R
40|$|Background: {{measures}} of physical capability may be predictive of subsequent health, but existing published studies {{have not been}} systematically reviewed. We hypothesised that weaker grip strength, slower walking speed and chair rising and shorter standing balance time, in community-dwelling <b>populations,</b> <b>would</b> be associated with higher subsequent risk of fracture, cognitive outcomes, cardiovascular disease, hospitalisation and institutionalisation...|$|R
40|$|Two of {{the five}} {{subspecies}} of the western big-eared bat, Corynorhinus townsendii, are listed as federally endangered with the remaining three being of conservation concern. Knowing the degree of connectivity among <b>populations</b> <b>would</b> aid {{in the establishment of}} sound conservation and management plans for this taxon. For this purpose, we have developed and characterized eight polymorphic microsatellite markers...|$|R
5|$|Survey markers were {{erected in}} Lloydminster to demark the Saskatchewan–Alberta {{boundary}}. Lloydminster {{is one of}} two Canadian cities on a provincial boundary and the gateway to Alberta. It currently ranks in size as the 89th largest city in Canada. The two sides of the city rank 10th in Alberta and 11th in Saskatchewan in municipal population. If the city were entirely in one province or the other, Lloydminster's <b>population</b> <b>would</b> rank ninth in Alberta and fifth in Saskatchewan. It is renowned for its booming petroleum industry and the OTS Heavy Oil Science Centre. The highway is surveyed north of the Battle River and south of the North Saskatchewan River. Marshall is the first town southeast of Lloydminster with 533 residents is also the hometown of NHL Goaltender, Braden Holtby. Lashburn, a town of 967 in 2011 maintains the Lashburn Municipal Campground.|$|E
5|$|The 2015 {{census of}} Malaysia {{reported}} {{a population of}} 2,636,000 in Sarawak, making it the fourth most populous state. However, this population is distributed over a large area resulting in Sarawak having the lowest population density {{in the country with}} only 20people per km2. Although it has a low population density, the average population growth rate of 1.8%, from 2000 to 2010, is very close to the national average of 2.0%. In 2014, 58% of the population resided in urban areas with the remainder in rural areas, but over the next 10 years it is predicted that the urban <b>population</b> <b>would</b> rise to 65%. , the crude birth rate in Sarawak was 16.3 per 1000 individuals, the crude death rate was 4.3 per 1000 population, and the infant mortality rate was 6.5 per 1000 live births.|$|E
5|$|The Black Death {{epidemic}} {{first arrived}} in England in 1348, re-occurring in waves during 1360–62, 1368–69, 1375 and more sporadically thereafter. The most immediate economic impact of this disaster was the widespread loss of life, between around 27% mortality amongst the upper classes, to 40–70% amongst the peasantry. Despite the very high loss of life, few settlements were abandoned during the epidemic itself, but many were badly affected or nearly eliminated altogether. The medieval authorities {{did their best to}} respond in an organised fashion, but the economic disruption was immense. Building work ceased and many mining operations paused. In the short term, efforts were taken by the authorities to control wages and enforce pre-epidemic working conditions. Coming on top of the previous years of famine, however, the longer-term economic implications were profound. In contrast to the previous centuries of rapid growth, the English <b>population</b> <b>would</b> not begin to recover for over a century, despite the many positive reasons for a resurgence. The crisis would dramatically affect English agriculture, wages and prices {{for the remainder of the}} medieval period.|$|E
50|$|In Antelopes: Global Survey And Regional Action Plans (1990), Rod East {{stated the}} view that the {{long-term}} survival of Burkina Faso's antelope <b>populations</b> <b>would</b> depend on developing rational wildlife utilization schemes in areas such as Deux Balés, recognizing the importance of bushmeat, and that giving legal protection to the antelope there would achieve little without other improvements in management.|$|R
5000|$|The Old Prussians spoke {{a variety}} of languages, with Old Prussian {{belonging}} to the Western branch of the Baltic language group. Old Prussian, or related Western Baltic dialects, may have been spoken as far southeast as Mazovia and even Belarus [...] in the early medieval period, but these <b>populations</b> <b>would</b> probably have undergone Slavicization before the 10th century [...]|$|R
30|$|In DHS surveys where mobile pastoralists are {{excluded}} from the sampling frames, there are often statements justifying the exclusion saying ‘it is only 2 / 3 / 4 % of the <b>population</b> and inclusion <b>would</b> make no difference to national indicators’. Although this is true, if those indicators could be disaggregated down to the local population level, the excluded <b>populations</b> <b>would</b> almost certainly be extremely different and usually highly disadvantaged compared to the national average. The demand for disaggregation in the SDGs may mean that {{they can no longer}} be swept under the carpet.|$|R
