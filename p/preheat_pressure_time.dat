40|$|AbstractRubber {{seeds are}} side {{products}} of rubber trees. Rubber seeds contain 40 - 50 % non-edible oil {{that can be}} used as industrial materials to produce variety of products such as linoleum, lubricant, cutting oil, alkyd resin, biodiesel, etc. To obtain oil from rubber seeds, there are two common methods {{that can be used}}, i. e. solvent extraction and mechanical pressing. Solvent extraction method uses solvent such as hexane to extract oil from rubber seeds. This method gives a higher yield compared to mechanical pressing method. However, since solvent is used in this method, it may reduce the quality of the oil. Mechanical pressing method gives a lower yield but simpler to do and gives a higher quality of oil. One of mechanical pressing machine usually used is hydraulic press. The objective of this research is to study the effects of temperature, <b>pressure,</b> <b>preheating</b> <b>time</b> and pressing time on rubber seed oil yield. Rubber seeds that had been cleaned, dehulled, dried, and flaked until the flakes are about 0. 5 - 0. 8 mm, are preheated at 60 - 80 °C for 45 - 75 minutes. Then, while the rubber seed flakes get further heated, the flakes are pressed for 30 - 90 minutes at 80 - 120 bar. The effects of temperature, <b>pressure,</b> <b>preheating</b> <b>time,</b> and pressing time on rubber seed oil yield are then evaluated using a 24 factorial design with 4 center points. The analysis of variance shows that <b>pressure,</b> pressing <b>time</b> and their interaction have significant effects on rubber seed oil yield. From experiment, the best condition that gives the highest rubber seed oil yield is at the highest pressure (120 bar) and the longest pressing time (90 minutes) which corresponds to 31. 88 % oil yield...|$|R

40|$|The shear {{strength}} of three-layer birch veneer/polyolefin/birch veneer lap joints has been investigated. It {{was found that}} the optimum technological parameters for producing three-layer laminated systems (plywood) at 180 °C were a <b>pressure</b> <b>time</b> of 1 - 3 min (plus 3 -min <b>preheating)</b> and <b>pressure</b> of 5 - 10 MPa. All the systems investigated exhibited relatively high values of {{shear strength}}, which were higher than those of the industrially produced plywood based on phenol-formaldehyde glues (3. 5 - 5 MPa). It is shown that the use of interfacial modifiers can increase the shear strength by 50 % compared with its initial values. The high shear resistance is explained by the high mechanical adhesion between the hot melts and the wood substrate. After a prolonged moisture influence (70 days at relative air humidity of 80 %), all the systems investigated showed a considerable (up to 25 %) increase in the shear strength. This can be explained by swelling of birch veneer, which gives rise to additional resistance forces between the hot melt and the substrate...|$|R

A new timed, automated, auto-adaptive non-invasive ventilatory mode (TA-mode) has been recently introduced. ObjectiveTo investigate the degree of respiratory muscle unloading with this new mode in comparison to assisted (S-mode) NIV in healthy individuals. MethodsWork of breathing, <b>pressure</b> <b>time</b> product and transdiaphragmatic <b>pressure</b> <b>time</b> product were measured during unassisted breathing, assisted and TA-mode-NIV in eight healthy, awake volunteers at inspiratory pressures of 20 and expiratory pressures of 4 hPa.

40|$|AbstractIn plantar {{pressure}} measurement, both peak <b>pressure</b> and <b>pressure</b> <b>time</b> integral {{are used}} as variables to assess plantar loading. However, <b>pressure</b> <b>time</b> integral shows a high concordance with peak pressure. Many researchers and clinicians use Novel software (Novel GmbH Inc., Munich, Germany) that calculates this variable as the summation of the products of peak pressure and duration per time sample, {{which is not a}} genuine integral of <b>pressure</b> over <b>time.</b> Therefore, an alternative calculation method was introduced. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the relevance of this alternative method, in different populations. Plantar pressure variables were measured in 76 people with diabetic polyneuropathy, 33 diabetic controls without polyneuropathy and 19 healthy subjects. Peak <b>pressure</b> and <b>pressure</b> <b>time</b> integral were obtained using Novel software. The quotient of the genuine force time integral over contact area was obtained as the alternative <b>pressure</b> <b>time</b> integral calculation. This new alternative method correlated less with peak pressure than the <b>pressure</b> <b>time</b> integral as calculated by Novel. The two methods differed significantly and these differences varied between the foot sole areas and between groups. The largest differences were found under the metatarsal heads in the group with diabetic polyneuropathy. From a theoretical perspective, the alternative approach provides a more valid calculation of the <b>pressure</b> <b>time</b> integral. In addition, this study showed that the alternative calculation is of added value, along peak pressure calculation, to interpret adapted plantar pressures patterns in particular in patients at risk for foot ulceration...|$|R
40|$|The average large {{gas bubble}} size in slurry bubble columns is {{estimated}} using a spectral analysis method applied to measured <b>pressure</b> <b>time</b> series. A <b>pressure</b> <b>time</b> series measured {{in a bubble}} column consists of local pressure fluctuations and global pressure fluctuations. The local pressure fluctuations arise from the liquid velocity fluctuations induced by the large gas bubbles and by the changes in gas holdup. The standard deviation of these local pressure fluctuations {{is a measure of}} the average large bubble size. The coherence between the <b>pressure</b> <b>time</b> series measured at the sparger and at any other location in the column is used to separate the local pressure fluctuations from the global pressure fluctuations. The global pressure fluctuations are measured instantaneously throughout the column and form the coherent part of the <b>pressure</b> <b>time</b> series. The local pressure fluctuations, which are absent at the sparger, form the incoherent part of the <b>pressure</b> <b>time</b> series. In a 2 -D bubble column, a clear correlation is demonstrated between the incoherent standard deviation of the <b>pressure</b> <b>time</b> series and the average large gas bubble size obtained from video imaging.

METHODS: Aortic stiffness and aortic pressure waves, reconstructed from finger blood pressure waves, were obtained in 2490 older adults {{within the framework of}} the Rotterdam Study, a large population-based study. Cardiac oxygen supply and demand were estimated using pulse wave analysis techniques, and related to aortic stiffness by linear regression analyses after adjustment for age, sex, mean arterial pressure and heart rate. RESULTS: Cardiac oxygen demand, estimated as the Systolic <b>Pressure</b> <b>Time</b> Index and the Rate Pressure Product, increased with increasing aortic stiffness [0. 27 mmHg s (95 % confidence interval: 0. 21; 0. 34) ] and [42. 2 mmHg/min (95 % confidence interval: 34. 1; 50. 3) ], respectively.
