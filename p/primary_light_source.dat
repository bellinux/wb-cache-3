50|$|The {{use of a}} flash or strobe {{is often}} {{regarded}} as the most difficult aspect of underwater photography. Some misconceptions exist about {{the proper use of}} flash underwater, especially as it relates to wide-angle photography. Generally, the flash should be used to supplement the overall exposure and to restore lost color, not as the <b>primary</b> <b>light</b> <b>source.</b> In situations such as the interior of caves or shipwrecks, wide-angle images can be 100% strobe light, but such situations are fairly rare. Usually, the photographer tries to create an aesthetic balance between the available sunlight and the strobe. Deep, dark or low visibility environments can make this balance more difficult, but the concept remains the same. Many modern cameras have simplified this process through various automatic exposure modes and the use of through-the-lens (TTL) metering. The increasing use of digital cameras has reduced the learning curve of underwater flash significantly, since the user can instantly review photos and make adjustments.|$|E

40|$|While {{computer}} vision systems often assume simple illumination models, real-world illumination is highly complex, consisting of reflected light {{from every direction}} as well as distributed and localized <b>primary</b> <b>light</b> <b>sources.</b> One can capture the illumination incident {{at a point in}} the real world from every direction photographically using a spherical illumination map. This paper illustrates, through analysis of photographically-acquired, high dynamic range illumination maps, that real-world illumination shares many of the statistical properties of natural images. In particular, the marginal and joint wavelet coefficient distributions, directional derivative distributions, and harmonic spectra of illumination maps resemble those documented in the natural image statistics literature. However, illumination maps differ from standard photographs in that illumination maps are statistically non-stationary and may contain localized <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> that dominate their power spectra.

40|$|In recent years, {{there is}} a growing {{interest}} for vegetables production in indoor or disadvantaged climatic zones by using greenhouses. The main problem of crop growing indoor or in environment with limited light availability is the correct choice of <b>light</b> <b>source</b> and the quality of lighting spectrum. In greenhouse and indoor cultivations, plant density is higher than in the open field and plants have to compete for light and nutrients. Nowadays, advanced systems for indoor horticulture use light emitting diodes (LED) for improving crop growth, enhancing the plant productivity and favouring the best nutritional quality formation. In closed environments, as indoor growing modules, the lighting system represents the only <b>source</b> of <b>light</b> and its features are fundamental for obtaining the best lighting performances for plant and the most efficient solution. LED lighting engines are more efficient compared to the <b>lighting</b> <b>sources</b> used traditionally in horticulture and allow light spectrum and intensity modulations to enhance the light use efficiency for plants. The lighting distribution and the digital controls are fundamental for tailoring the spectral distribution on each plant in specific moments of its growth and play an important role for optimizing growth and produce high-quality vegetables. LED lights can increase plant growth and yield, but also nutraceutical quality, since some light intensities increase pigments biosynthesis and enhance the antioxidants content of leaves or fruits: in this regards the selection of LED <b>primary</b> <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> in relation to the peaks of the absorbance curve of the plants is important...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} novel {{plausible}} realistic rendering method for mixed reality systems, which is useful for many real life application scenarios, like architecture, product visualization or edutainment. To allow virtual objects to seamlessly blend into the real environment, the real lighting conditions and the mutual illumination effects between real and virtual objects must be considered, while maintaining interactive frame rates (20 - 30 fps). The most important such effects are indirect illumination and shadows cast between real and virtual objects. Our approach combines Instant Radiosity and Differential Rendering. In contrast to some previous solutions, we only need to render the scene once {{in order to find}} the mutual effects of virtual and real scenes. The dynamic real illumination is derived from the image stream of a fish-eye lens camera. We describe a new method to assign virtual point <b>lights</b> to multiple <b>primary</b> <b>light</b> <b>sources,</b> which can be real or virtual. We use imperfect shadow maps for calculating illumination from virtual point lights and have significantly improved their accuracy by taking the surface normal of a shadow caster into account. Temporal coherence is exploited to reduce flickering artifacts.

2500|$|There {{were two}} {{different}} types of Restoration theatres in England: Restoration commercial theatres and Restoration court theatres. Commercial theatres tended to be more [...] "conservative in their lighting, for economic reasons" [...] and therefore used [...] "candle-burning chandeliers" [...] primarily. Court theatres could afford to [...] "use most of the Continental innovations" [...] in their productions [...] (Penzel 16). Theatres such as the Drury Lane Theatre and the Covent Garden Theatre were lit by a large central chandelier and had a varying number of smaller stage chandeliers and candle sconces around the walls of the theatres. Two main court theatres, built between 1660 and 1665, were the Cockpit Theatre and the Hall Theatre. Chandeliers and sconces seemed to be the <b>primary</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>sources</b> here but other developments were being made, especially at the Hall. By the 1670s, the Hall Theatre started using footlights, and between 1670 and 1689 they used candles or lamps. It can be noted {{that by the end of}} the 17th century, [...] "French and English stages were fairly similar". There is not much written on theatrical lighting in England at the end of the 17th century and from the little information historians do have, not much changed by the middle of the 18th century. Gas lighting hit the English stage in the early 1800s beginning with the Drury Lane and Covent Garden theatres. [...] In the 1820s, a new type of artificial illumination was developed. [...] In this type of illumination, a gas flame is used to heat a cylinder of quicklime (calcium oxide). [...] Upon reaching a certain temperature, the quicklime would begin to incandesce. [...] This illumination could then be directed by reflectors and lenses. It took some time from the development of this new Limelight before it found its way into theatrical use, which started around 1837. [...] Limelight became popular in the 1860s and beyond, until it was displaced by electrical lighting. [...] Lighting advances made in English Theatres during this timeframe paved the way for the many lighting advances in the modern theatrical world.|$|R
