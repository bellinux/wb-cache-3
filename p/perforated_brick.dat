Utzon wanted the concrete flank walls to be left partially uncovered but shortly after his involvement ended, they were completely clad with travertine. Similarly, the rough <b>perforated</b> <b>brick</b> Utzon had prescribed for improving the acoustics inside the building was replaced with American acoustic panels.

5000|$|Throughout his practice, Baker became {{well known}} for {{designing}} and building low cost, high quality, beautiful homes, with a great portion of his work suited to or built for lower-middle to lower class clients. His buildings tend to emphasise prolific - at times virtuosic - masonry construction, instilling privacy and evoking history with brick jali walls, a <b>perforated</b> <b>brick</b> screen which invites a natural air flow to cool the buildings' interior, in addition to creating intricate patterns of light and shadow. Another significant Baker feature is irregular, pyramid-like structures on roofs, with one side left open and tilting into the wind. Baker's designs invariably have traditional Indian sloping roofs and terracotta Mangalore tile shingling with gables and vents allowing rising hot air to escape. Curved walls enter Baker's architectural vocabulary {{as a means to}} enclose more volume at lower material cost than straight walls, and for Laurie, [...] "building became more fun with the circle." [...] A testament to his frugality, Baker was often seen rummaging through salvage heaps looking for suitable building materials, door and window frames, sometimes hitting a stroke of luck as evidenced by the intricately carved entry to the Chitralekha Film Studio (Aakulam, Trivandrum, 1974-76): a capricious architectural element found in a junk heap.|$|E

The main auditorium provided seating accommodation for 800 people and a dance floor of approximately 6000 square feet (557.42m2). The area under the stage and dressing rooms contained a kitchen and supper room. The main entrance foyer provided cloak room facilities, a ticket box and soft drink bar, as well as stairs to a gallery level above. Sliding metal and coloured glass screens separated the foyer from the auditorium. The library was located in front of the auditorium with a separate entrance, and contained [...] "outdoor reading rooms" [...] and a workroom enclosed with vertical wooden louvres.

40|$|AB STRACT: An attempt {{has been}} made to assess new {{potential}} applications for the Bailén clays, traditionally used for manufacturing bricks, based on mineralogical, chemical, particle size, plasticity and firing results. Raw materials and mixtures used by the local factory were selected and tested with the addition of some diatomite, feldspar or kaolin. Based on their properties, clay materials from Bailén might be suitable for making porous red wall tiles, clinker, vitrified red floor tiles and porous light-coloured wall tiles by pressing; the first could be manufactured from the raw materials and mixtures currently used by the local manufactures. On the other hand, stoneware shaped by extrusion, such as <b>perforated</b> <b>bricks,</b> facing bricks and roofing tiles, can be also manufactured from the mixtures used at the factory if they contain 20 25 % carbonate and small amounts of iron oxides; lightweight bricks require black and yellow clays with diatomite. Tertiary clays from the Bailén area (southern Spain) have traditionally been used for manufacturing bricks and other ceramic building materials (González et al., 1985, 1992). Except for some specific clays, the Bailén reserves appear to be virtually unlimited. More than 90 % of the industrial products obtained from these clays are <b>perforated</b> <b>bricks</b> and only two factories manufacture higher grade products such as clinker facing bricks and roofing tiles.

Therefore, the paper investigates, in an interdisciplinary way, two innovative {{technologies that}} valorize Stainless Steel (SS) slags as block masonry (bricks) : carbonation and thermo-alkali-activation. The technical, environmental and economic features of three SS bricks - solid <b>bricks,</b> <b>perforated</b> <b>bricks</b> and light-weight aerated blocks – are compared to commercially available construction materials. Although the produced bricks meet industrial standards, technical challenges such as optimization of alkali addition and use of metal molds should be dealt with before upscaling to industrial production. A cradle-to-gate Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) that aggregates the results of the various impact categories shows that the environmental impact of solid and <b>perforated</b> SS <b>bricks</b> is lower than the impact of conventional clay-baked bricks thanks to the avoidance of additives for slag stabilization and energy consumption for sintering clay. The impact of aerated SS bricks was found to be similar to the commercially available aerated blocks. More specifically, the CO 2 uptake from carbonation reduces the overall environmental impact whereas use of alkalis increases the impact. A SWOT analysis highlights the economic advantages of SS bricks originating from lower energy requirements, reduced dependence on primary resources and improved metal recovery from slag. However, in order to apply the innovative technologies at industrial scale, challenges related to processing conditions, feedstock variability and potential competition from existing brick suppliers have to be overcome. status: publishe...|$|R

The specimens were three real-scale <b>perforated</b> <b>brick</b> walls. The experimentation consisted in collapse testings under increasing lateral load and constant vertical load. The reinforced condition consisted in strengthening the masonry walls with Carbon Fiber-Reinforced-Polymeric strips bonded onto the masonry surface. The CFRP reinforcement was applied by using three different techniques. The first technique involved epoxy bonding of strips (common application). The second technique involved the bonding of strips with epoxy resin and strengthening the bond with studs (FRP studs embedded into the masonry and connected with the strips). The third technique consisted in the epoxy bonding of strips under vacuum (i. e., using a special vacuum-packed system to push the resin into the masonry as deep as possible). This research aimed at investigating the differences in the structural behaviors of tested perforated masonry walls due to these three different CFRP application techniques. Actually, the experimental results prove that the application technique influences both the load-carrying capacity and the ultimate horizontal displacement of the perforated tested masonry walls.

This paper discusses the comminution of porousmaterials having voids of compact shape (like spheres) and not interconnected. For such materials different behaviours can be expected for the two comminution ranges above and below the mean voids interspace. In fact, for the coarser sizes the mechanical behaviour of the material is that of the porousmaterial defined by its bulk mechanical properties; below the mean voids interspace down to very fine sizes the mechanical behaviour of the material is that of the non-porousmaterial constituting the matrix. Therefore, a transitional region should exist, with the result of bi- or trimodal size distributions for comminuted porousmaterials. To verify the above mentioned theory, tests were performed on two types of materials, artificial and natural: (a) <b>perforated</b> <b>bricks</b> with 20 mm voids; (b) natural pumice stone.

The hypotheses were that conditioned white seabream would avoid predators more efficiently and would be more capable to shelter, showing higher survival and smaller dispersal than naïve fish. Six thousand HR white seabream (6. 32 ± 0. 93 cm total length) were allocated in twelve plastic tanks and divided in four experimental groups: three groups were conditioned with a predator, a refuge or both, while one group was left unconditioned and used as a control. The conditioning phase lasted 30 days and was conducted using live conger eels as predators and pyramids of <b>perforated</b> <b>bricks</b> as refuges. Flight initiation distance (FID) and time to shelter (TS) were used as response variables to test the effects of conditioning in the arena, using a dummy conger eel. The effect of conditioning on post-release survival and dispersal was assessed through the monitoring of 1465 tagged seabream belonging to the four experimental groups, released at sea. Underwater visual census was used as monitoring technique. The sighting rate (SR) (sighted fish/ released fish× 100) and the distance (D) of each sighted fish from the release site were used as proxies for post-release survival and dispersion, respectively. In the arena, conditioned seabream showed significantly higher FID and lower TS than naïve fish. At sea, the estimated post-release survival of conditioned seabreams (SR= 9. 4...|$|R
40|$|The Urban Heat Island (UHI) {{phenomenon}} induces harmful outdoor comfort conditions, {{an increase}} in pollutants concentration, an excessive energy consumption related to the greater use of air conditioning systems and a raise of the frequency and magnitude of electricity demand peaks. In the Mediterranean area the urban warming and the solar heat gain in buildings need to be controlled in a sustainable way for keeping the indoor temperature at comfortable values. Green roofs and green walls can mitigate the heat events related to UHI, lower the indoor temperatures, cut energy loads on buildings, enhance human thermal comfort conditions and increase the buildings thermal insulation in winter. Experimental tests were carried out at the University of Bari (Italy) starting from summer 2014, aiming to analyze the influences of different climbing plants, as main components of green systems, applied on building walls. Three vertical walls, made of <b>perforated</b> <b>bricks,</b> were built. They were equipped with a sealed structure, on their backside, in order to realize prototypes of buildings in scale. The first wall was covered with Pandorea jasminoides variegated, the second with Rhyncospermum jasminoides, the third wall was kept uncovered and used as control. Several climatic parameters concerning {{the walls and the}} ambient conditions were collected during the experimental test by means of a data logger and sensors. High definition infra-red images for each wall were recorded using a Thermal Imaging Camera for analyzing the surface temperature of the plants and of the walls. The daylight temperatures observed on the walls protected with plants during warm days were lower than the respective temperatures of the control wall up to 5 °C; the nighttime temperatures observed during cold days were higher than the respective temperatures of the control wall up to 3 °C...|$|R
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of urban warming, known as urban heat island, negatively influences outdoor comfort conditions and pollutants concentration {{and as well}} increases the environmental impact due to the energy demand for air conditioning. Urban warming can be attenuated by reducing the solar heat gain that increases building’s temperature during the hot season. Solar heat can be mainly reduced by increasing the insulation between the exterior and interior of the building, {{as well as by}} shading the building surface from direct sun exposure. A sustainable technology for improving the energy efficiency of buildings is the use of green roofs and green walls that: allow the physical shading of the building and promote evapotranspiration in summer; increase the thermal insulation in winter. An experimental test was carried out at the University of Bari (Italy, 41 ° 05 'N, 16 ° 53 'E). Three prototypes of building vertical wall, made with <b>perforated</b> <b>bricks,</b> were designed: two vertical walls were covered with plants (one with Pandorea jasminoides variegated, the second with Rhyncospermum jasminoides) while the third wall was kept uncovered and was used as control. A system composed by a data logger and sensors was used to measure and record the following parameters: temperature of the wall surface under solar radiation and of the surface {{on the other side of}} the wall, solar radiation falling on the wall, external air temperature and wind speed. During summer 2014 the diurnal temperatures of the control surface exposed to the solar radiation were higher by about 4 °C compared to the temperatures recorded on both the vertical walls covered with Rhyncospermum jasminoides and Pandorea jasminoides variegated. The thermal wave propagated with a phase shift of about 2 hours and half...|$|R
