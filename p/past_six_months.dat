40|$|Study objective: To {{assess the}} {{relations}} between characteristics of the neighbourhood internal and external built environment and <b>past</b> <b>six</b> <b>month</b> and lifetime depression. Design and setting: Depression and sociodemographic information were assessed in a cross sectional survey of residents of New York City (NYC). All respondents were geocoded to neighbourhood of residence. Data {{on the quality of}} the built environment in 59 NYC neighbourhoods were collected from the United Status census, the New York City housing and vacancy survey, and the fiscal 2002 New York City mayorâs management report. Main results: Among 1355 respondents, residence in neighbourhoods characterised by a poor quality built environment was associated with greater individual likelihood of <b>past</b> <b>six</b> <b>month</b> and lifetime depression in multilevel models adjusting for individual age, race/ethnicity, sex, and income and for neighbourhood level income. In adjusted models, persons living in neighbourhoods characterised by poorer features of the built environment were 29 %â 58 % more likely to report <b>past</b> <b>six</b> <b>month</b> depression and 36 %â 64 % more likely to report lifetime depression than respondents living in neighbourhoods characterised by better features of the built environment. Conclusions: Living in neighbourhoods characterised by a poor quality built environment is associated with a greater likelihood of depression. Future prospective work designed to assess potential mechanisms underlying these associations may guide public health and urban planning efforts aimed at improving population mental health...|$|R

5|$|Police interviewed Farrar at 6:20 a.m, informing him {{immediately}} that {{the bodies of}} Tim and Kelly had been recovered. He told police about the deterioration of his marriage and health over the <b>past</b> <b>six</b> <b>months.</b> In August 1995, Farrar had fallen ill with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. He initially assumed it was a residual effect of the traveler's diarrhea many people on the Peru trip had contracted while there. Though he recovered from the initial bout of symptoms, he relapsed about a week later, and on August 18 Farrar was hospitalized with severe dehydration and high fever. In the hospital, he developed sepsis. Doctors identified Streptococcus viridans, which had probably leaked through damaged digestive tissue {{as a result of}} Farrar's severe diarrhea, as the source of the sepsis; however, they could not pinpoint the root cause of the gastrointestinal illness itself. Though Farrar's illness was severe and possibly life-threatening, he eventually recovered and was released from the hospital on August 25. That night, however, shortly after eating a dinner that Green had served him, Farrar again suffered vomiting and diarrhea and had to be hospitalized. A third bout of symptoms struck on September 4, days after he was released from the hospital for the second time. Basing their conclusions on the likelihood that his illness was related to the Peru trip, doctors narrowed down the possible causes for Farrar's gastrointestinal issues to a handful, though none fitted his symptoms perfectly: typhoid fever, tropical sprue, or gluten-sensitive enteropathy. Farrar had noticed that each time he returned home from the hospital, he became ill again almost immediately, and he speculated that it may have been due to the stress of his dissolving marriage or the change from a bland hospital diet to a normal home one. When Farrar's girlfriend, Margaret Hacker, told him she suspected Green was poisoning him, he initially wrote off the idea as ridiculous.|$|E

Once they arrive at Dytallix B for this secret meeting, the crew discover the Horatio and two other Federation ships already present. Picard beams alone to the surface and is met by Captain Keel and the other captains. Keel reports strange orders from Starfleet headquarters and what he implies are suspicious deaths of Starfleet officers, and expresses concern of a conspiracy. Picard refuses to accept this without proof, but Keel warns him to remain wary. When the captain returns to the Enterprise, he is challenged by Counselor Troi (Marina Sirtis) about keeping his contact with Keel secret. Picard is skeptical about the conspiracy, but says that he trusts his old friend completely. The Enterprise resumes its previous journey.

40|$|Women {{are less}} likely than men to seek {{treatment}} for substance abuse (alcohol and illicit drugs). In 2005, women comprised about 32 % of all substance abusers seeking treatment (SAMHSA, 2005). One study found that 23 % of men and 15. 1 % of women with alcohol abuse or dependence had ever received treatment, suggesting that a smaller proportion of substance abusing women receive treatment than substance abusing men (Greenfield et al., 2006). Reduced treatment-seeking among women may be due to an interaction of both external and internal barriers. External barriers are defined as socio-cultural or structural factors discouraging treatment attendance and internal barriers are defined as beliefs or feelings within a person, whether instilled by others or not, that discourage treatment attendance. One internal barrier to treatment, to be focused on in this study, is the negative social support women may perceive when seeking treatment (Xu et al., 2008, Xu et al., 2007, Green, 2006). Women often may not seek treatment because they are dissuaded to attend by those in their social circle (Xu et al., 2008, Green, 2006). In fact, women are {{more likely than men to}} have substance abusing loved ones who support and reinforce substance use (Green, 2006).

Thirty-seven schizophrenia patients (17 with past SA and 20 without) and 32 controls (12 with past SA and 20 without) completed two versions of a 2 -back WM task during fMRI scanning on separate days. Analyses focused on regions whose patterns of activation replicated across both n-back tasks. Schizophrenia patients were significantly less accurate than controls on both n-back tasks. No main effects or interactions with past SA on WM performance were observed. However, several fronto-parietal-thalamic regions showed an interaction between diagnostic group and past SA. These regions were significantly more active in controls with past SA compared to controls without past SA. Schizophrenia patients with or without past SA either showed no significant differences, or patients with past SA showed somewhat less activation compared to patients without past SA during WM. These results suggest robust effects of past SA on WM brain functioning in controls, but less impact of past SA in schizophrenia. This is consistent with previous literature indicating less impaired neurocognition in schizophrenia with SA...|$|R

Especially in rural parts, many {{patients}} {{have no access to}} antiretroviral therapy (ART). The goal {{of this study was to}} assess the treatment outcome of ART in a simple rural setting in western Uganda. Patients were recruited from mothers participating in a program for reduction of mother-to-child-transmission of HIV and their partners. Over a period of <b>six</b> <b>months</b> after starting on ART clinical, immunological and virological parameters of these patients were collected. Adherence, factors promoting non-adherence and correlation between adherence and increase of the mean cellular volume of erythrocytes (a known side effect of the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor Zidovudine) as a possible marker for adherence were also assessed. Antiretroviral medication was applied as triple-therapy, only. Prophylaxis of opportunistic infections was carried out according to the CD 4 -cellcount with Isoniazid/ Pyridoxine, Fluconazole and Trimetoprim/ Sulfamethoxazole. The results of 42 patients naive to prior ART were analysed. The baseline CD 4 -lymphocyte count was 147 cells/mm³ (median), the baseline viral load was 98. 638 copies/mm³ (median). 71. 4 % of the patients reported HIV related symptoms or diseases in the <b>past.</b> Within <b>six</b> <b>months</b> of ART, the patients had an increase in CD 4 -lymphocyte count of 105 cells/mm³ (median) and a decrease in viral load of 2. 17 log 10 (median). For 71. 4 % of the patients the viral load was below detectable levels. After <b>six</b> <b>months</b> there was a median weight gain of 2. 5 kg and only 4. 8 % of the patients showed HIV-related symptoms or diseases. The intake of intrapartum single-dose Nevirapine within <b>six</b> <b>months</b> before starting ART did not significantly influence the treatment outcome. Reported adherence was 98. 8 % (median) and did not correlate significantly with an increase of the mean cellular volume of erythrocytes. Treatment outcome and adherence of ART patients in this rural region in western Uganda were comparable to results from urban ART-programs in Subsaharan Africa and from industrialized countries. Differences, which may point to special challenges for the application of ART in rural African areas, were found in the reported reasons for partial non-adherence: lack of transportation possibilities and large distances to treatment centers can impair continuity of medication intake, especially for poor or very ill patients...|$|R

I struck his trail, hot, on the street, and {{followed}} it on a run to a cheap hotel. That was a costly mistake; a dog would have gone the other way. But I am only part dog, and can get very humanly stupid when excited. He had been stopping in that house ten days; I almost know, now, that he stops long nowhere, the <b>past</b> <b>six</b> or eight <b>months,</b> but is restless and has to keep moving. I understand that feeling! and I {{know what it is}} to feel it.

When the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) was established in Afghanistan, on 20 December 2001, following the intervention by a UN-backed coalition, the international community recognized that the country’s reconstruction efforts were contingent on it staying peaceful. The ISAF, however, was designed as only a temporary measure to provide the confidence and time required for the creation of an indigenous security sector. The Agreement on Provisional Arrangements in Afghanistan Pending the Re-establishment of Permanent Government Institutions, of 5 December 2001, states that the responsibility for ensuring security throughout Afghanistan ultimately rests with the Afghans themselves. Following a critical examination of the conditions facing international actors determined to facilitate local public security management in Afghanistan following more than two decades of protracted conflict, the paper proposes practical recommendations applicable to governments and organizations committed to improving security sector governance after war. Although progress has been achieved in an inhospitable environment- particularly during the <b>past</b> <b>six</b> to twelve <b>months,</b> a...|$|R
