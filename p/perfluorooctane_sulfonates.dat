The paper also overviews the current status in applying POPs in foam concentrates and its test method in China. The author indicates that to test <b>perfluorooctane</b> <b>sulfonates</b> (PFOS) in foam concentrates involves two steps, pretreatment and test. Provided the test equipment is of high reliability and validity, test result solely depends on the result of pretreatment. About POPs Persistent substances are defining as the substances of strong chemical stability, hard degradation, not easy to disappear in the environment and will retain {{for a long period}} of time. And those organic pollutants which meet the above conditions are regarded as persistent organic pollutants (POPs) [1]. High toxicity. Even in low expansion, POPs will do harm to living bodies. The toxicity of the most toxic among dioxins is equal to 100 times toxicity of potassium chloride. It could be called the most toxic compound on the earth. Dozens of pgs of 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDD could cause guinea pigs to death. Continuous feeding per kg of pregnant monkey on a few pgs could lead to abortion. POPs also has biological amplification. POPs could accumulate to high concentration by food chain, and give rise to larger hazard...|$|E
40|$|<b>Perfluorooctane</b> <b>sulfonates</b> (PFOS) as a persistent, {{bioaccumulative}} {{and toxic}} pollutant has been detected in surface water {{around the world}} and attracted great attention in recent years. It's important and urgent to develop effective technology to remove PFOS. The effect of coagulation pretreatment on the removal efficiency of PFOS by nanaltration (NF) was investigated. Two types of NF membranes were used to test the PFOS rejections in three different solutions including DI water, humic acid (HA) solution and coagulation solution. The characterizations such as HA and PFOS accumulation on the membranes, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and surface zeta potential analysis of virgin and fouled membranes were conducted to study the separation mechanism. The experimental results showed that PFOS can be partly removed by coagulation. The NF 270 membrane exhibited a higher PFOS rejection (> 95 %) than the HYDRACORE membrane (40 - 60 %) in single NF process. The surface negative charge density of both NF membranes reached a minimum value after filtering coagulation effluent, which might be a result of floc adsorption on the membrane surface. Coagulation pretreatment was effective to enhance the PFOS rejection of the NF membranes. In particular, the rejection efficiency of the HYDRACORE membrane increased from 55 % to 86 % at a trans-membrane pressure of 0. 4 MPa. The SEM images showed that the fouling layer formed by flocs was loose and highly permeable. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

Serum uric acid is a novel biomarker, even mild elevations of which has been implicated in the development of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease. We examined the relationship of serum perfluoroalkyl chemicals, including perfluorooctanoic acid and <b>perfluorooctane</b> <b>sulfonate,</b> and elevated uric acid levels in a representative sample of US adults. Methods: We examined 3883 participants from the 1999 &ndash; 2000 and 2003 &ndash; 2006 National Health and Nutritional Examination Surveys,a representative, multiethnic population-based survey of noninstitutionalized US adults. Serum perfluorooctanoic acid and <b>perfluorooctane</b> <b>sulfonate</b> were analyzed as quartiles. The main outcome was hyperuricemia. Results: We found that serum levels of perfluoroalkyl chemicals, including perfluorooctanoic acid and <b>perfluorooctane</b> <b>sulfonate,</b> were positively associated with hyperuricemia. This association appeared to be independent of confounders such as age, gender, race-ethnicity, body mass index, diabetes, hypertension, and serum cholesterol. Compared with subjects in quartile 1 (referent), the multivariate odds ratio for hyperuricemia among subjects in quartile 4 was 1. 97 (95 % confidence interval 1. 44 &ndash; 2. 70, P &lt; 0. 0001) for perfluorooctanoic acid and 1. 48 % (95 % confidence interval 0. 99 &ndash; 2. 22, P = 0. 0433) for <b>perfluorooctane</b> <b>sulfonate.</b> This observed association persisted in subgroup analysis by gender and body mass index.

PFAA were measured in blood serum as well as v- 3 fatty acids in plasma phospholipids as a biomarker for fish consumption. Higher levels of PFAA were associated with male sex, increased age, and higher education.
