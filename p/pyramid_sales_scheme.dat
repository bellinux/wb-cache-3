40|$|The Indian FMCG {{sector is}} the fourth largest sector in the economy with a total market size in excess of US$ 20. 1 billion. It has a strong MNC {{presence}} and {{is characterized by a}} well-established distribution network, intense competition between the organized and unorganized segments and low operational cost. Availability of key raw materials, cheaper labour costs and presence across the entire value chain gives India a competitive advantage. Also, increase in the urban population, along with increase in income levels and the availability of new categories, would help the urban areas maintain their position in terms of consumption. At present, urban India accounts for 66 % of total FMCG consumption, with rural India accounting for the remaining 34 %. However, rural India accounts for more than 40 % consumption in major FMCG categories such as personal care, fabric care, and hot beverages. newline Family income is one of the variables which should be considered while designing <b>sales</b> promotion <b>schemes</b> more specifically cash discount.

40|$|The thesis {{comprises}} ethnography {{of alternative}} provisioning {{in a range}} of households on a street in North London. It considers the alternative (non-formal retail) means by which goods are acquired and exchanged. The areas of inquiry include gift- giving, mail order catalogues, network <b>sales</b> <b>schemes,</b> second-hand goods, nearly new 'jumble' sales and self-provisioning. Challenging polarised models of the household and the market, the gift and the commodity, the thesis reveals how alternative modes of consumption are used to generate and contest value in everyday practice. In particular, the study focuses on the activities of women {{and the ways in which}} social networks are constituted around specific types of acquisition and material culture. These activities include the swapping of second hand baby goods, the provisioning of children's parties and gifts, the decorating of the home and the use of commercial network <b>sales</b> <b>schemes</b> revolving around fashion, cosmetics and housewares. Aesthetic practice and modes of acquisition are considered in the context of immediate social relations and domestic settings. As well as providing empirical data regarding a range of consumption practices in contemporary Britain, the thesis goes on to argue that it is within these forms of provisioning that the practice of normativity is most evident. While a major theoretical pretext of anthropological enquiry is the question of how culture operates cohesively in the context of modernity, what arises from this ethnography is the extent to which goods and the values made around them, through exchange, are used in the making of the normative. This thesis examines the role of everyday alternative provisioning in constituting and contesting moral and social pressures to determine a basis of conformity and having made these conditions, facilitate the relationships that depend upon them...|$|R

30|$|The {{possible}} {{mechanisms for}} how home renting correlates with crime include the following. First, {{from the perspective}} of crime infusion, urban villagers, or property owners, the management of villages or communities and local governments are all devoted to developing rental economies out of economic motivation, and then to encouraging the mixed use of living and work spaces, forming various multifunctional buildings and spaces for living, manufacturing, and storage at the same time. These pose many potential threats in fire control, food safety, and public safety. The fragility of the residential space increases migrants’ risk of being victims (Zatz and Smith 2012). Second, {{from the perspective of}} derivatives of crime, economic crime and ordinary crime can overlap or transformed into each other. The production and sales of fake goods, crime in food production, gambling and drugs, and <b>pyramid</b> <b>sales</b> can induce robbery and theft, violent protection, and organized crime. Reversely, organized crime can also catalyze money laundering and other aspects of the dark economy. Third, from the perspective of crime export, rental housing can incubate legal offenses and criminal behaviors. The narrowness and spatial constraints of rental apartments in many semi-urbanized areas of China set limits to the long-term commitment and investment of domestic immigrants, and impede their social communication, increasing the possibility of failing into criminal behavior.|$|R

In our formal framework, the firm sets a price for its product and chooses a <b>sales</b> <b>scheme,</b> which effectively determines how consumers can learn from each other about the product’s popularity. Our results on the profitability of different schemes provide insights on a variety of managerial issues that are of practical relevance for product launch. Specifically, to best exploit network effects, our results suggest releasing pre-order and sales information to consumers. They also suggest taking a sequential approach to multi-market product launch, launching first in smaller markets before larger ones. Moreover, they identify possible benefits of promoting pre-release consumer communication, and support the idea of targeting independent-minded consumers, so they can serve as opinion leaders for those who follow...|$|R

Finally, the SVR forecasting models are applied to each group to generate final forecasting results.

GLC housing sales were not allowed during the Labour administration of the mid-1970s but picked up again once Cutler became Leader in 1977.

The policy was largely in place for the 1974 Conservative manifesto, but did not prove an asset in the two general elections that year because of high interest and mortgage repayment rates, as well as the growth of negative equity as house prices fell.|$|R
