Historically there was no lack of publishers of these works, but there was a real need for distributors; <b>Printed</b> <b>Matter</b> functions as a distribution agency and as well as a publisher of [...] "bookworks" [...] created by artists like Sol LeWitt. Another descriptor that is useful in describing the materials produced by <b>Printed</b> <b>Matter</b> is book art. The works published by <b>Printed</b> <b>Matter</b> are editioned and are conceived by artists as art works; however, they are not the expensive book arts / book objects but are often mass-produced in large batches of affordable editions.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{an account of}} the events of the first ten years of <b>Printed</b> <b>Matter,</b> Inc., a distribution center for artists’ books established in New York City in 1976. Included are descriptions of the individuals who formed <b>Printed</b> <b>Matter’s</b> first board, their objectives, books published by <b>Printed</b> <b>Matter,</b> and the windows installation program. This thesis also describes challenges the board members faced, including lack of organization, difficulty cultivating a broad public audience, and inadequate income. In addition, it recounts the gradual streamlining of business practices, and the realignment of goals and expectations for the genre as board members accepted the fact of a limited audience for artists’ books. The conclusion offers a brief summary and a look at <b>Printed</b> <b>Matter,</b> Inc. ’s current operations...|$|R
5000|$|The legal {{analysis}} of this issue speaks in terms of [...] "printed matter" [...] that is imprinted upon a [...] "substrate." [...] For example, letters might be printed {{on a piece of}} paper as substrate, in an extreme case. Or digitized information (the <b>printed</b> <b>matter),</b> such as a jpeg file representative of the Mona Lisa, might be encoded in an EPROM memory chip as substrate. A computer program (the <b>printed</b> <b>matter)</b> might be encoded in a computer-readable medium such as a hard disk (the substrate)----and thus be the subject of a so-called Beauregard claim. The current {{legal analysis}}, as expressed in the definitive decision on <b>printed</b> <b>matter,</b> In re Gulack, is as follows: The differences between a newly claimed substrate bearing <b>printed</b> <b>matter</b> and a prior art substrate, where the only point of departure from the prior art is in the <b>printed</b> <b>matter</b> itself, are not entitled to patentable weight unless the <b>printed</b> <b>matter</b> and the substrate have a new and unobvious functional relationship. The analysis is thus essentially an obviousness analysis under section 103 of the patent law, rather than (as it was in earlier times) an analysis of statutory subject matter under what is now section 101 of the patent law.|$|R

40|$|The <b>printed</b> <b>matter</b> {{doctrine}} is {{a branch of}} the section 101 doctrine of patent eligibility that, among other things, prevents the patenting of technical texts and diagrams. The contemporary formulation of the {{doctrine is}} highly problematic. It borders on incoherency in many of its applications, and it lacks any recognized grounding in the Patent Act. Yet, despite its shortcomings, courts have not abandoned the <b>printed</b> <b>matter</b> doctrine, likely because the core applications of the doctrine place limits on the reach of the patent regime that are widely viewed as both intuitively 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 correct 2 ̆ 2 and normatively desirable. Instead of abandoning the doctrine, courts have marginalized it. They have retained the substantive effects of the <b>printed</b> <b>matter</b> doctrine but avoided analyzing it whenever possible. This Article adopts a different approach: it takes the <b>printed</b> <b>matter</b> doctrine seriously. It reinterprets the <b>printed</b> <b>matter</b> doctrine as the sign doctrine, revealing both the conceptual coherence hidden in the doctrine 2 ̆ 7 s historical applications and the doctrine 2 ̆ 7 s as-of-yet unnoticed statutory grounding. The key to this reconceptualization is recognizing that the <b>printed</b> <b>matter</b> doctrine is in effect already based on semiotic principles. The <b>printed</b> <b>matter</b> doctrine purports to be about information, but it is actually about signs. It purports to curtail the patenting of worldly artifacts, but it actually curbs the reach ofpatent protection into mental representations in the human mind. To support these arguments, this Article offers a course in 2 ̆ 2 Semiotics 101 2 ̆ 2 : a semiotics primer strategically targeted on the principles that prove to be relevant to the section 101 doctrine ofpatent eligibility. This Article also examines one unexpected consequence of taking the <b>printed</b> <b>matter</b> doctrine seriously and adopting a semiotic framework. It reconsiders the patentability of a class of software inventions which are defined here as 2 ̆ 2 computer models. 2 ̆ 2 As a matter of semiotic logic, the routine patentability of newly invented computer models under the contemporary patent eligibility doctrine cannot be reconciled with the categorical unpatentability of mechanical measuring devices with new labels under the <b>printed</b> <b>matter</b> doctrine...|$|R
50|$|Artist AA Bronson {{served as}} {{executive}} director of <b>Printed</b> <b>Matter</b> from 2004-2010 and during that time created and directed the NY Art Book Fair.

5000|$|Initially {{publishing}} artist's books, <b>Printed</b> <b>Matter,</b> Inc. {{was founded}} {{by a group of}} artists in 1976 as a for-profit art space in the Tribeca neighborhood of New York City. The idea behind publishing artist's books, initiated by artist Sol LeWitt, was that instead of producing free, promotional items from art dealers, the artist's books <b>Printed</b> <b>Matter</b> would create would be serious, unique publications made by artists, not dealers. The name [...] "artist's book" [...] was coined from an 1973 exhibition held at Moore College of Art and Design that Dianne Perry Vanderlip curated; the name <b>Printed</b> <b>Matter</b> came after that event.|$|R
