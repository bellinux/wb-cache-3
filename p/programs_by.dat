40|$|Ribosomes <b>programmed</b> <b>by</b> {{different}} synonymous codons {{also differ}} in discriminating among near-cognate aminoacylated tRNAs. In the initial {{step of the}} recognition reaction ribosomes <b>programmed</b> <b>by</b> UUC discriminate less well than ribosomes <b>programmed</b> <b>by</b> UUU against ternary complexes containing three types of Leu-tRNA, and ribosomes <b>programmed</b> <b>by</b> CUC discriminate less well than ribosomes <b>programmed</b> <b>by</b> CUU against ternary complexes containing Phe-tRNA. Furthermore, in the proofreading step ribosomes <b>programmed</b> <b>by</b> UUC discriminate less well than ribosomes <b>programmed</b> <b>by</b> UUU against two of three near-cognate Leu-tRNAs, and ribosomes <b>programmed</b> <b>by</b> CUC discriminate less well than ribosomes <b>programmed</b> <b>by</b> CUU against near-cognate Phe-tRNA. The codon-induced change in reaction rate with near-cognate ternary complexes is greater than that with cognate ternary complexes: the most efficient codon is, therefore, the least accurate. Because the efficient, but inaccurate, codon UUC is used preferentially in highly expressed mRNAs of Escherichia coli, maximization of translational accuracy apparently has not been significant {{in the evolution of}} this particular biased codon choice in E. coli...|$|R

The information gathered by these surveys is used by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) to assess bird conservation priorities. Other conservation <b>programs</b> <b>by</b> the USFWS include the Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands Migratory Bird Conservation and the maintenance of 5 wildlife refuges at Cabo Rojo, Laguna Cartagena, Vieques, Culebra and Desecheo.

Financially, Alpha Kappa Alpha expanded funding for projects in 1953 through the creation and trademark of a fashion show called Fashionetta. Politically, ACHR continued lobbying for equality concerning civil rights during the 1950s and 1960s. According to Collier-Thomas, the ACHR drew attention to legislation concerning education, transportation, employment, and improving equality {{in the armed forces}} and public places. The ACHR participated in filing civil rights cases in amicus curiae with Bolling v. Sharpe and 1954's Brown v. Board of Education. However, as a whole, ACHR voted to dissolve operations in 1963.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1970s, the CTW's main non-television efforts {{changed from}} {{promotion}} {{to the development}} of educational materials for preschool settings. Early efforts included mobile viewing units that broadcast the show in the inner cities, in Appalachia, in Native American communities, and in migrant worker camps. During the early 1980s, the CTW created the Preschool Education Program (PEP), whose goal was to assist preschools, by combining television viewing, books, hands-on activities, and other media, in using the series as an educational resource. The Workshop also provided materials to non-English speaking children and adults. Starting during 2006, the Workshop expanded its <b>programs</b> <b>by</b> creating a series of PBS specials and DVDs largely concerning how military deployment affects the families of soldiers. Other efforts by the Workshop concerned families of prisoners, health and wellness, and safety.|$|E

5|$|Blue's Clues {{was set in}} the home—the {{environment}} that was most familiar and secure for preschoolers—and looked like no other children's television show. Each episode was in development, from idea development to final production, for approximately one year. Writers created a goal sheet, which identified their objectives based on the show's curriculum and audience needs. Script drafts, once developed {{and approved by the}} show's creators and research team, were tested at public and private schools, day care centers, preschools, and Head Start <b>programs</b> <b>by</b> three researchers, who would narrate the story {{in the form of a}} storybook and take notes about the children's responses. The writers and creators revised the scripts based on this feedback. A rough video, in which the host performed from the revised script in front of a blue screen with no animation, was filmed and retested. The script was revised based on the audiences' responses, tested a third time with animation and music added, and incorporated into future productions.|$|E

Her mother insisted that she finish high school, and so Copeland returned to California for her senior year, even though ABT arranged to pay for her performances, housing accommodations and academic arrangements. She studied at the Summer Intensive Program on full scholarship for both summers and was declared ABT's National Coca-Cola Scholar in 2000. In the 2000 Summer Intensive Program, she danced the role of Kitri in Don Quixote. Copeland's strongest memory from the summer is working with Tharp on Push Comes to Shove". Of the 150 dancers in the 2000 Summer Intensive Program, she was one of six selected to join the junior dance troupe.|$|E

In 1952 and 1953 he was part of U.N. sponsored missions in public administration in Colombia, the Philippines, and Japan. His next one-year U.N. appointment was as co-Director of the Public Administration Institute for Turkey and the Middle East in Ankara, Turkey. Indiana University then appointed him director of the Institute of Training for Public Service and Coordinator of Indonesian and Thailand Public Administration <b>Programs.</b> <b>By</b> the time of his retirement, further appointments, research and lecture tours and vacations had enabled him to visit nearly one hundred countries around the world as well as every state in the union. In 1956, after a year as visiting professor of government at the University of California, Berkeley, he returned to Bloomington as Professor of Government at Indiana University, where he remained until his retirement. In the course of his career he secured 21 National Science Foundation grants to support his research.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Programming</b> <b>by</b> {{example is}} a way of {{programming}} a software system in its own user interface. The user of the system writes a <b>program</b> <b>by</b> giving an example of what the program should do. The system records the sequence of actions, and can perform it again. <b>Programming</b> <b>by</b> example allows a user to create programs without doing conventional <b>programming.</b> <b>Programming</b> <b>by</b> example was incorporated into a simulation of an office information system. As the system evolved, {{it became clear that the}} basic concept of <b>programming</b> <b>by</b> example needed to be extended: certain aspects of program creation are better done <b>by</b> <b>program</b> modification than <b>by</b> using the programming-by-example mechanism. The final system includes a static program representation that is easy to understand, a mechanism for describing data, and a method of adding control structure. A user operates on certain data while creating a <b>program</b> <b>by</b> example, but does not necessarily tell the system why that data was selected. The user can supply this missing information by using data descriptions, which are program operands that specify how to choose the data to be used when the program is run. The system automatically supplies reasonable default data descriptions while recording a program; if necessary the user can modify the descriptions later to reflect his or her true intentions. Since <b>programming</b> <b>by</b> example is best at recording sequential user actions, rather than branching o...|$|R
