50|$|A {{leadscrew}} (or lead screw), {{also known}} as a <b>power</b> <b>screw</b> or translation screw, is a screw used as a linkage in a machine, to translate turning motion into linear motion. Because of the large area of sliding contact between their male and female members, screw threads have larger frictional energy losses compared to other linkages. They are not typically used to carry high power, but more for intermittent use in low power actuator and positioner mechanisms. Common applications are linear actuators, machine slides (such as in machine tools), vises, presses, and jacks.|$|E

50|$|<b>Power</b> <b>screws</b> are {{classified}} by {{the geometry of}} their thread. V-threads are less suitable for leadscrews than others such as ACME because they have more friction between the threads. Their threads are designed to induce this friction to keep the fastener from loosening. Leadscrews, on the other hand, are designed to minimize friction. Therefore, in most commercial and industrial use, V-threads are avoided for leadscrew use. Nevertheless, V-threads are sometimes successfully used as leadscrews, for example on microlathes and micromills.|$|R

Additionally, this casing will be inserted into the ground in segments two meters long which will penetrate the regolith simultaneously with the auger. The vertical action of the mobile platform will provide a downward force to the casing string through a special adaptor, giving the casing the needed impetus to sink the anticipated depth of ten meters. Casing segments will be connected with a simple snap arrangement. Excess casing will be cut off by a cylindrical cutting tool which will also transport the excess casing away from the hole.

40|$|AbstractFailure {{analysis}} in mechanical components {{has been investigated}} in many studies {{in the last few}} years. Failure analysis and prevention are important functions in all engineering disciplines. Materials engineers are often the lead role in the analysis of failures, where a component or product fails in service or if a failure occurs during manufacturing or production processing. In any case, one must determine the cause of the failure to prevent future occurrences and/or to improve the performance of the device, component or structure. For example, the vise jaw holders of hacksaws can break due to accidental heavy loads or machine misuse. The parts that break are the stationary and movable vise jaw holders and the connecter <b>power</b> <b>screw</b> between the holders. To investigate the failure of these components, a three-dimensional finite element model for stress analysis was performed. First, the analysis identified the broken components of the hacksaw machine. In addition, the type of materials of the broken parts was identified, a CAD model was built, and the hacksaw mechanism was analyzed to determine the accurate applied loads on the broken parts. After analyzing the model using Abaqus CAE software, the results showed that the location of the high stresses was identical with the high-stress locations in the original, broken parts. Furthermore, the <b>power</b> <b>screw</b> was subjected to a high load, which deformed the <b>power</b> <b>screw.</b> Also, the stationary vise jaw holder was broken by impact because it was not touched by the <b>power</b> <b>screw</b> until the movable vise jaw holder broke.

In this modified design, the <b>power</b> <b>screw</b> is rotated through its connecting gear with the pinion gear when electrical power flows through the cigarette lighter receptacle connected to the motor, plugged to the automobile 12 V battery source to generate power for the prime mover (motor), which transmits its rotating speed to the pinion gear meshing with the bigger gear connected to the <b>power</b> <b>screw</b> to be rotated with required speed reduction and increased torque to drive the <b>power</b> <b>screw.</b> The significance and purpose of this work is to modify the existing car jack {{in order to make the}} operation easier, safer and more reliable in order to reduce health risks especially back ache problems associated with doing work in a bent or squatting position for a long period of time.

40|$|Abstract—Continuously {{variable}} transmission (CVT) {{is a type}} of automatic transmission that can change the gear ratio to any arbitrary setting within the limits. The most common type of CVT operates on a pulley system that allows an infinite variability between highest and lowest gears with no discrete steps. However, the current CVT system with hydraulic actuation method suffers from the power loss. It needs continuous force for the pulley to clamp the belt and hold the torque resulting in large amount of energy consumption. This study focused on the development of an electromechanical actuated control CVT to eliminate the problem that faced by the existing CVT. It is conducted with several steps; computing and selecting the appropriate sizing for stroke length, lead screw system and etc. From the visual observation {{it was found that the}} CVT system of this research is satisfactory. II. METHODOLOGY One approach of changing the CVT ratio is by using an electromechanical actuator. This includes a set of <b>power</b> <b>screw</b> and a DC motor for each pulley. The function of <b>power</b> <b>screw</b> mechanisms is for shifting movable sheaves axially along the shafts. For this system to function effectively the primary motor is responsible for changing transmission ratio and the secondary motor is for controlling the belt slippage. The system only operates during the transmission ratio changing which consume less power compared to the conventional hydraulic CVT. The <b>power</b> <b>screw</b> mechanism makes sure that the pulley is held at its place when there is no gear ratio changing...|$|E
