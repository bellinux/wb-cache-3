5000|$|Aphanes (<b>parsley-piert)</b> is a genus {{of around}} 20 {{species in the}} rose family (Rosaceae), native to Europe, Asia and Australia. A 2003 study {{indicated}} that Aphanes may belong to the genus Alchemilla, commonly called lady's-mantle. They are slender, annual prostrate herbs, much-branched with deeply lobed leaves, pilose (covered with soft hair) and on short petioles. The tiny green to yellow flowers without petals grow in clusters in the denticulate leaflike stipules.|$|E
50|$|The Whin Sill is an igneous rock, Dolerite, {{which gives}} rise to a soil {{chemistry}} particular to the location, and thus to a distinct habitat for vegetation. Soil on the Whin Sill is thin and prone to drought in summer months. Plant species found at the site include the Perennial plant wild onion (Allium vineale), maiden pink (Dianthus deltoides), common rockrose (Helianthemum nummularium), meadow oat-grass (Avenula pratensis) and crested hair-grass (Koeleria macrantha). Annual plants including knotted clover (Trifolium striatum), forget-me-nots (Myosotis spp), dove’s-foot cranesbill (Geranium molle), <b>parsley-piert</b> (Aphanes arvensis), heath groundsel (Senecio sylvaticus) and squirreltail fescue (Vulpia bromoides). More acidic areas provide habitat for sheep’s fescue (Festuca ovina) and bell heather (Erica cinerea).|$|E
50|$|Aphanes arvensis, {{known as}} <b>parsley-piert,</b> is a sprawling, downy plant common {{all over the}} British Isles where It grows on arable fields and bare wastelands, {{particularly}} in dry sites. The short-stalked leaves have three segments each lobed at the tip. Flowers April-September. The tiny green flower has four sepals and no petals, the fruit is oval pointed. Stipules form a leaf-like cup, enclosing the flower. The name of parsley piert {{has nothing to do}} with parsley. It is a corruption of the French perce-pierre, meaning 'stone-piercer' and was given to the plant because of its habit of growing in shallow, stony soil and emerging between stones. As in the case of saxifrage (from the Latin meaning 'stone-breaker') it was wrongly assumed that the plant could pierce stones; and it was thought that a medicine made of parsley piert would break up stones in the bladder and kidneys. Old folk-names for the plant include 'colicwort' and 'bowel-hive-grass' (hive meant inflammation), showing that it was also used for intestinal ailments.|$|E
50|$|Mount Tabor {{was entirely}} covered with {{vegetation}} typical of northern Ancient Israel until {{the reign of}} the Ottoman Empire, during which period most of the trees were felled. The trees were felled for use in the charcoal industry. As part of the Jewish National Fund's efforts to recreate the landscapes of the country, the area was reforested with trees which are similar to its original vegetation during the 1960s and 1970s. Today, most of Mount Tabor is covered with trees, Mount Tabor Oak (Quercus ithaburensis) and Palestine oak (Quercus calliprinos). Up to 400 plant species have been found on the Mount, including large yellow crocuses (Sternbergia clusiana), the Persian lily (Fritillaria persica) rain-bells flowers (Muscari parviflorum), while tulips (Tulipa agenensis), orchids, irises (including Iris haynei) and yellow asphodel (Asphodeline Lutea), spontaneous barley (Hordeum spontaneum), Mt. Tabor larkspur, a rather rare perennial grass with blue spring flowers (Delphinium ithaburense), sweet cicely (myrrhoides nodosa), a very rare plant of the umbelliferae family, Galileahn alkanet (Alkanna galilaea) and <b>parsley-piert</b> (Aphanes arvensis).|$|E
40|$|The Broadbalk {{experiment}} {{was started in}} 1843 to investigate {{the relative importance of}} different plant nutrients (N, P, K, Na, Mg) on grain yield of winter wheat. Weeds were controlled initially by hand hoeing and fallowing, but since 1964, herbicides have been applied to the whole experiment {{with the exception of the}} 18 plots on Section 8. Approximately 130 weed species have been recorded on Broadbalk and about 30 of these are currently recorded annually on Section 8. Detailed weed surveys, conducted from 1930 to 1979, provide a unique 50 -yr record, but the relatively small number of frequency categories used (six) poses a limitation on the interpretation of these data for ecological studies. Weed surveys were restarted in 1991 on Section 8. The current assessment method records the presence of individual 2 weed species in 25 random 0. 1 -m(2) quadrats per plot, which is more appropriate for detecting long-term trends in weed frequencies and population differences between plots. A principal components analysis of the 1991 - 2002 survey data for 15 species showed clearly the influence of inorganic N fertilizer levels on the frequency of individual species. The frequency of one species (common chickweed) was greatly favored by increasing amounts of nitrogen fertilizer from 0 to 288 kg N ha(- 1), others were strongly disadvantaged (e. g., black medic and field horsetail), some were slightly disadvantaged (e. g., common vetch and <b>parsley-piert),</b> and some showed little response to differing N rates (e. g., blackgrass and corn poppy). Other weed investigations include studies on the effects of fallowing on the weed seed bank, seed dormancy and persistence, agroecology, and population dynamics of individual weed species. Recently, molecular approaches have been used to study the genetic diversity of weeds found on Section 8, which is one of the few arable sites in the country where herbicides have never been applied. This site also provides an invaluable reserve for seven nationally rare or uncommon species. Broadbalk continues to act as a valuable resource for weed investigations 160 yr after it was established...|$|E
