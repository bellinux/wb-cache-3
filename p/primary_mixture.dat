The synthesis conditions were designed to produce small particles with narrow size range. The prepared samples were characterized by XRD and SEM techniques in order to evaluate the crystallinity, morphology and particle size. The XRD pattern was used to evaluate the crystallinity and phase purity. The phase purity of some samples, including SAPO- 18 was determined by DIFFaX analysis from XRD data. The results were shown that formation of SAPO- 18 is enhanced by increasing the acid content in the <b>primary</b> <b>mixture.</b> lower Si/Al ratio in a <b>primary</b> <b>mixture</b> resulted in production of AlPO’s and SAPO- 5 impurities.

In the mixture with amorphous SiO 2, Ca(OH) 2 re-acted completely during 7 days of synthesis, while large quantity of Ca(OH) 2 remained unreacted even after 28 days when quartz was used. It was found that in the Ca(OH) 2 –amorphous SiO 2 –H 2 O system, after a 28 -day exposure, the surface of SiO 2 globules was totally covered with well-crystalline C-S-H(I) plates.

40|$|Minerals of the tobermorite {{group with}} double [Al 3 ++Na+] substitutions were {{synthesized}} using both, non-ground raw mineral mixtures and mixtures {{ground in a}} colloidal mill. The synthesis of calcium sili-cate hydrate is more effective when dry <b>primary</b> <b>mixtures</b> ground in a colloidal mill are taken, because compositions of higher degree of crystallinity are synthesized under the same conditions. In the latter case, tobermorite is formed after 24 h. It is thought that grinding a mixture of CaO, SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 in a colloidal mill induces activation centres which later activate synthesis via hydrothermal processing. It is reasonable to grind dry reactants used for synthesising tobermorite in a colloidal mill before hydrothermal processing. Under our experimental conditions, tobermorite was formed more effectively when the spe-cific surface was lower than 547 m 2 ·kg – 1. Use of finer particles of reactants does not enhance the reac-tion rate because of the stabilising influence of (0. 8 – 1. 5) CaO·SiO 2 ·(0. 5 – 2. 5) H 2 O (C–S–H (I)) on the overall reaction rate of the synthesis of tobermorite.

The optimal conditions of hydrotalcite hydrothermal synthesis in Mg 5 (CO 3) 4 (OH) 2  4 H 2 O and -Al 2 O 3 mixtures are: the temperature of isothermal curing – 200 °C, duration – 1 h, and <b>primary</b> <b>mixture</b> Mg/Al molar ratio – 2.

40|$|In {{this study}} {{properties}} of natural raw and industrial waste materials was determined {{in order to}} use them to create hydraulically active belite and belite sulfoaluminate cements. For this purpose, various technologic parameters for manufacture of belite cement were investigated: optimal conditions for hydrothermal synthesis of α-C 2 SH; the kinetics of the products burned at 450 – 1000 °C temperature and their hydration process. In purpose to create belite sulfoaluminate cement there were theorical calculations made for the <b>primary</b> <b>mixture,</b> moreover, clinker‘s burning conditions were determined, ivestigated its hydration process and the impact of the impact of different amounts of gypsum addition to the clinker‘s hydraulic properties. The purpose of this work was to determine the formation of dicalcium silicates during the hydrothermal synthesis and thermal activation, to investigate the impact of mineral composition of the products on the hydraulic activity and to create the mixtures for manufacture of belite and belite sulfoaluminate cements. Mixture which was prepared for belite cement contained of burned lime and burned opoka. The optimal temperature for burning the lime was determined to be 900 °C for 1 h, because under these conditions the biggest amount of free CaO was obtained (82. 5 %). Opoka needs to be burned 775 °C for 1 h (19. 15 % of free CaO). For <b>primary</b> <b>mixture</b> belite sulfoaluminate cement, these materials were used – hard coal fly ash, limestone and anhydrite. The amounts of required primary materials were calculated in order to obtain ~ 70 % β-C 2 S and ~ 25 % ye‘elimite (Ca 4 Al 6 O 12 (SO 4)) during the burning process. α-C 2 SH was synthesized by processing opoka-lime mixture (molar ratio CaO/SiO 2 = 2. 0) under hydrothermal conditions. The optimal conditions of synthesis were determined: duration of the isothermal curing at 200 °C – 12 h, water/solid ratio W/S = 10. 0, stirring speed – 50 RPM. It was found that during the thermal activation of hydrothermal synthesis products at 450 – 1000 °C temperature, forms various polymorphs of dicalium silicates. x-C 2 S and γ-C 2 S were formed and remained stable until 700 and 800 °C, respectively. β-C 2 S starts composing at 600 °C temperature and remains stable even after thermal treatment at 1000 °C, α‘L-C 2 S appears only at 900 °C and the amount of it increases after burning at at 1000 °C. It was determined that during the thermal activation of milled α-C 2 SH and quartz sand mixture phases are changing differently. At 450 °C only x-C 2 S was formed and remained stable until 800 °C, while β-C 2 S started forming at 600 °C, the maximum quantity of it has been reached at 900 °C and most of it transited to α‘L-C 2 S or decomposed to wollastonite at 1000 °C. Calorimetric analysis for α-C 2 SH and α-C 2 SH in mixture with quartz sand, burned at 450 – 1000 °C temperature, was performed. The results showed that samples, burned at 450 – 600 °C temperature have hydraulic properties. According to the results, the most hydraulically active sample is α-C 2 SH in mixture with quartz sand, burned at 450 °C temperature: after 72 h of hydration it released the biggest amount of total heat – 67. 52 J/g. This material is suitable for manufacture of fast curing binder material. During the manufacture of belite sulfoaluminate cement, β-C 2 S and ye‘elimite were obtained during the burning of <b>primary</b> <b>mixture</b> at 1225 – 1275 °C temperature for 1 – 6 h. The amount of these phases dependence on burning conditions was investigated and it showed that increasing the temperature and prolonging the duration of burning does not {{have a significant impact on}} the amounts of these phases: the amount of β-C 2 S increases from 61. 4 to 66. 3 %, ye‘elimite – from 21. 6 to 25. 1 %. For this reason the samples burned at 1225, 1250 and 1275 °C temperature for 1 h were chosen for calorimetric analysis. This analysis showed that the biggest amount of heat after 72 h was released in the sample, burned at 1275 °C temperature – 133. 08 J/g. The influence of different amount of gypsum addition to the clinker‘s hydration was investigated. Three different SO 3 :ye’elimite molar ratios were chosen: 1, 1. 5 and 2 (3. 57, 6. 64 and 9. 52 wt. % of gypsum, respectively). The biggest value of total heat after 72 h of hydration was reached in the sample where SO 3 :ye’elimite molar ratio was equal to 1. 5 – 133. 55 J/g. The mortar strength test after 1, 7 and 28 days was performed and compressive strength was equal to 15. 78, 19. 92 and 20. 70 MPa.

An experimental and analytical study of such diffractions, which are fundamental to many explosive applications, has been conducted in a two channel shock tube, using H 2 -O 2 mixtures of different equivalence ratios as the primary and bounding or secondary explosive. The combination of mixtures was varied from rich primary / lean secondary to lean primary / rich secondary since the nature of the diffraction was found to depend on whether the Chapman-Jouguet velocity of the <b>primary</b> <b>mixture,</b> D p, was greater than or less than that of the secondary mixture, D s.

Two basic types of diffraction and modes of detonation reinitiation were observed. When D p > D s, an oblique shock connecting the primary detonation to an oblique detonation in the secondary mixture was observed. With D p D s.

40|$|We {{perform a}} study of the final state {{interactions}} of the K K¯ 0 and the ¯ K 0 d systems in the reactions pp → dK K¯ 0 and pp → dπ + η. Since the two-meson system couples strongly to the a 0 (980) resonance, these reactions are expected to be an additional source of information about the controversial scalar sector. We also show that these reactions present peculiar features which can shed additional light on the much debated meson-baryon scalar sector with strangeness − 1. We deduce the general structure of the amplitudes close to the dK + K ¯ 0 threshold, allowing for primary K K¯ 0 as well as π + η production with the two mesons in relative S- or P-wave. The interactions of the mesons are accounted for by using chiral unitary techniques, which generate dynamically the a 0 (980) resonance, and the ¯ K 0 d interaction is also taken into account. General formulae are derived that allow to incorporate the final state interactions in these systems for any model of the production mechanism. We illustrate this approach by considering two specific production mechanisms based on three flavor meson-baryon chiral perturbation theory. It is demonstrated that in this scenario the ¯ K 0 d interactions are very important and can change the cross section by as much as one order of magnitude. The amount of π + η versus K K¯ 0 production is shown to depend critically on the <b>primary</b> <b>mixture</b> of the two mechanisms, with large interference effects due to final state interactions. These effects are also shown to occur in the event distributions of invariant masses which are drastically modified by the final state interactions of the two-meson or the ¯Kd system...|$|E

An amount of NaOH, corresponding to 5 % Na 2 O from the mass of dry materials, added {{in the form of}} solution and additional water was used so that the water/solid ratio of the suspension was equal to 10. 0. Hydrothermal synthesis of the unstirred suspension was carried out in saturated steam at 150, 175, 200 ºC. The duration of isothermal curing was 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 72 and 168 h. The temperature of 150 ºC is too low for the synthesis of gyrolite; the stoichiometric ratio C/S = 0. 66 is not reached even after 168 h of synthesis neither in pure mixtures nor in mixtures with addition of Na 2 O. Na+ ions significantly influence the formation of gyrolite from the CaO–quartz mix-tures in the temperature range from 175 ºC to 200 ºC. Gyrolite is formed at 175 ºC after 168 h and at 200 ºC after 16 h of isothermal curing. On the contrary, in pure mixtures it does not form even after 72 h at 200 ºC. Na+ ions also change the compositions of intermediate and final products of the synthesis.

We monitored basic chemistry and acute toxicity to a suite of standard aquatic test species (fathead minnow-Pimephales promelas, Daphnia pulex, Daphnia magna, and Ceriodaphnia dubia) in produced water and in samples taken from shallow groundwater wells on the site. Toxicity identification evaluations and ion toxicity modeling were used to identify toxic constituents in the samples. Lake sediment at the oil production site and at a reference site were also analyzed for brine intrusion chemically and by testing sediment toxicity using the benthic invertebrates, Chironomus dilutus, and Hyallela azteca. Sediment quality was also assessed with in situ survival and growth studies with H. azteca and the Asian clam, Corbicula fluminea, and by benthic macroinvertebrate community sampling. The produced water was acutely toxic to the aquatic test organisms at concentrations ranging from 1 % to 10 % of the whole produced water sample. Toxicity identification evaluation and ion toxicity modeling indicated major ion salts and hydrocarbons were the <b>primary</b> <b>mixture</b> toxicants. The standardized test species used in the laboratory bioassays exhibited differences in sensitivity to these two general classes of contaminants, which {{underscores the importance of}} using multiple species when evaluating produced water toxicity. Toxicity of groundwater was greater in samples from wells near a produced water injection well and an evaporation pond. Principle component analyses (PCA) of chemical data derived from the groundwater wells indicated dilution by lake water and possible biogeochemical reactions as factors that ameliorated groundwater toxicity. Elevated concentrations of major ions were found in pore water from lake sediments, but toxicity from these ions was limited to sediment depths of 10 cm or greater, which is outside of the primary zone of biological activity. Further, exposure to site sediments did not have any effects on test organisms, and macroinvertebrate communities did not indicate impairment at the oil production site as compared to a reference site. In situ experiments with H. azteca and C. fluminea, indicated a sublethal site effect (on growth of both species), but these could not be definitively linked with produced water infiltration. Severe weather conditions (drought followed by flooding) negatively influenced the intensity of lake sampling aimed at delineating produced water infiltration. Due to the lack of clear evidence of produced water infiltration into the sub-littoral zone of the lake, {{it was not possible to}} assess whether the laboratory bioassays of produced water effectively indicate risk in the receiving system. However, the acutely toxic nature of the produced water and general lack of biological effects in the lake at the oil production site suggest minimal to no produced water infiltration into surficial lake sediments and the near-shore water column. This study was able to demonstrate the utility of ion toxicity modeling to support data from toxicity identification evaluations aimed at identifying key toxic constituents in produced water. This information could be used to prioritize options for treating produced water in order to reduce toxic constituents and enhance options for reuse. The study also demonstrated how geographic information systems, toxicity modeling, and toxicity assessment could be used to facilitate future site assessments...|$|E

Despite the documented technical and economic advantages of SCC in precast, prestressed applications, the use of SCC has been limited in some countries due to some technical uncertainties of such innovative material. To explore some unsolved issues related to SCC and to contribute to a wider acceptance of SCC in precast, prestressed applications, this study was undertaken to assess the effect of mixture proportioning and material characteristics on the performance of SCC and recommend performance-based specifications for use of SCC in the precast, prestressed applications. The thesis presents an experimental program that contains four parts: (1) a parametric study to evaluate the influence of binder type, w/cm, coarse aggregate type, and coarse aggregate nominal size on the modulus of elasticity and compressive strength developments; (2) a parametric study to evaluate the effect of mixture proportioning and material characteristics on fresh and hardened properties of SCC; (3) a fractional factorial design to identify the relative significance of <b>primary</b> <b>mixture</b> parameters and their coupled effects on SCC properties; and (4) a field validation using full-scale AASHTO Type II girders cast to investigate constructability, material properties, and structural performance (the latter part was carried out by the research team of Professor Denis Mitchell at McGill University). Based on the experimental test results, SCC exhibits similar compressive strength and modulus of elasticity to that of conventional high-performance concrete (HPC) of normal slump consistency. SCC and HPC mixtures made of a given binder type exhibit similar autogenous shrinkage. However, SCC exhibits up to 30 % and 20 % higher drying shrinkage and creep, respectively, at 300 days compared to HPC made with similar w/cm but different paste volume. The results of the experiment program show that among the investigated material constituents and mix design parameters, the w/cm has the most significant effect on mechanical and visco-elastic properties. The binder content, binder type, and sand-to-total aggregate ratio (S/A) also have considerable effect on those properties. The thickening-type viscosity modifying admixture (VMA) content (0 to 150 ml/ 100 kg CM) does not significantly affect mechanical and visco-elastic properties. Based on the findings, some mixture parameters regarding the overall performance of SCC designated for precast and prestressed applications can be recommended: SCC made with relatively low w/cm (such as 0. 34 vs. 0. 40) should be selected to ensure desirable compressive strength, modulus of elasticity (MOE), flexural strength, as well as less drying shrinkage and creep; the use of crushed aggregate with 12. 5 mm MSA is suggested since it provides better mechanical properties of SCC compared to gravel; the use of low S/A (such as 0. 46 vs. 0. 54) to secure adequate mechanical and visco-elastic properties is recommended; the use of thickening-type VMA can help to secure robustness and stability of the concrete in the case of SCC proportioned with moderate and relatively high w/cm; and the use of Type MS cement can lead to lower creep and shrinkage than Type HE cement and 20 % Class F fly ash. However, SCC mixtures made with Type HE cement and 20 % Class F fly ash can result in better workability and mechanical properties. Therefore, it is recommended to use Type HE cement and 20 % Class F fly ash and reduce binder content (such as 440 kg/m[exposant 3] vs. 500 kg/m[exposant 3]) to assure better overall performance of SCC. Validation on full-scale AASHTO-Type II girders using two HPC and two SCC mixtures show that girders casting with SCC can be successfully carried out without segregation and blocking for the selected optimized mixtures. The surface quality of the girders cast with SCC is quite satisfactory and of greater uniformity than girders cast with HPC. Both HPC and SCC mixtures develop similar autogenous shrinkage for mixtures made with similar w/cm. Again, the two evaluated SCC mixtures develop about 20 % greater drying shrinkage than comparable HPC mixtures. Modifications of existing models to assess mechanical and visco-elastic properties of SCC used in the precast, prestressed applications are proposed. Based on the comparisons of various code provisions, the ACI 209 and CEB-FIP codes with suggested material coefficients can be recommended to estimate compressive strength. The modified AASHTO 2007 model can be used for predicting the elastic modulus and flexural strength. The AASHTO 2004 and 2007 models with suggested material coefficients can be used to estimate drying shrinkage and creep, respectively. The CEB-FIP 90 code model can be used to predict both drying shrinkage and creep. Finally, the modified Tazawa and Miyazawa 1997 model with material modifications can be used to estimate autogenous shrinkage of SCC...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} the {{kinetics}} of catalytic decomposition of H 2 O 2 by some metal (M) vanadates and their <b>primary</b> oxide <b>mixtures,</b> where M=Mg, Ca, Ni, Cu and (Cuo. 5 +Mgo. 5) for catalysts (J-V), respectively, reveals that the decomposition reaction is homogeneous for catalysts (/ and IT), whereas for (Iff—V) {{the early stages of}} the reaction are mainly heterogeneous. However, whenever the vanadium, nickel or copper ions go into solution, in the form of the peroxo compounds of vanadium(V), they catalyze the reaction homogeneously at relatively low decomposition rates. Significance of the concept of bivalent catalytic centres towards enhancement of the catalyst activity has been established. It was found that the parameter which best characterizes the intrinsic order of catalytic activity is the activation entropy of the reaction and not the activation energy deduced.

40|$|The {{measurement}} of composition {{of natural gas}} mixtures is commonly used for the calculation of its calorific value. Natural gas is a fossil fuel and its economic value per unit of volume or mass is mainly determined by its calorific value.

40|$|The {{transition}} radiation tracker (TRT) {{is one of}} the three subsystems of the inner detector of the ATLAS experiment. It is designed to operate for 10 yr at the LHC, with integrated charges of similar to 10 C/cm of wire and radiation doses of about 10 Mrad and 2 multiplied by 10 ** 1 ** 4 neutrons/cm** 2. These doses translate into unprecedented ionization currents and integrated charges for a large-scale gaseous detector. This paper describes studies leading to the adoption of a new ionization gas regime for the ATLAS TRT. In this new regime, the <b>primary</b> gas <b>mixture</b> is 70 %Xe- 27 %CO** 2 - 3 %O** 2. It is planned to occasionally flush and operate the TRT detector with an Ar-based ternary mixture, containing a small percentage of CF** 4, to remove, if needed, silicon pollution from the anode wires. This procedure has been validated in realistic conditions and would require a few days of dedicated operation. This paper covers both performance and aging studies with the new TRT gas mixture. 12 Refs...|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} {{of carrying out}} accurate and reliable measurements is a fundamental topic in many different fields, in particular for the safeguard {{of the environment and}} the climatic conditions of the planet. This is the basis for the planning of correct actions to prevent environmental damages and potential harmful effects for the health of the human beings. The application of metrology to chemical monitoring can assure the reliability of measurement results.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} analysis of the design, fabrication and testing of a silicon based, microfluidic cell, for transmission terahertz time-domain spectroscopy. The sensitivity of the device is tested through a range of experiments involving <b>primary</b> alcohol/water <b>mixtures.</b> The dielectric properties of these solutions are subsequently extracted using a Nelder–Mead search algorithm, and are in good agreement with literature values obtained via alternative techniques. Quantities in the order of 2  μmol can be easily distinguished for primary alcohols in solution, even with the subwavelength optical path lengths used. A further display of the device sensitivity is shown through the analysis of commercial whiskeys, where there are clear, detectable differences between samples. Slight absorption variations were identified between samples of the same commercial brand, owing to a 2. 5 % difference in their alcoholic content. Results from data taken on subsequent days after system realignment are also presented, confirming the robustness of the technique, and the data extraction algorithm used.
