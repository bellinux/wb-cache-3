In addition to properties of building thermal envelops and technical features of HVAC systems, it can drastically influence the consumption of energy. Applied ICT solutions have been recognised as an essential factor for reducing consumptions and emissions in the operational stage of buildings. However, keeping users engaged is still a challenge to overcome. This paper aims to critically review approaches for user engagement from conceptual and technical points of view and to propose an enhanced engaging procedure. Common user engaging practices <b>provide</b> <b>advices</b> on how to save energy or present feedbacks {{through a number of}} solutions. Generally, these solutions detect direct measures through sensors, but barely make information valuable to users. The proposed engaging procedure intends ensuring user commitment through a bottom-up approach based on gaming strategies, conceived upon user-made rules. Basically, by means of a dedicated platform, users are able to define specific rules tackling everyday life actions, experiencing in an active way the use of sensors and actuators. Additionally, a set of rules, generated beforehand by experts for promoting energy saving behavioural changes, is gradually proposed through the platform accordingly to user commitment level...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT In {{the last}} decades animal {{production}} has considerably increased worldwide to sustain an ever-growing human population. Among animal reared for consumption purposes, chickens are undoubtedly {{one of the most}} successful, mainly due to their rapid growth rate. The development of broiler farming has been accompanied in recent years by a substantial attention to animal welfare. This study is aimed at assessing the effects of different housing conditions on both feed conversion ratio and mortality of male broiler flocks through a large-scale study (more than 100 million birds) involving 977 farms belonging to one major producer. For this, we evaluated nine features of the housing system using a linear model with random effect. The features were: roofing, floor, drinkers, feeders, water source, color curtain color, management, light and ventilation. A total of 3516 poultry flocks were assessed. Positive ventilation, metal and clay roof, dirt floor and owner management were shown to reduced mortality. Concrete floor, negative ventilation, blue curtains, fluorescent lightening, owner management, tap water and well water significantly improved FCR. We discuss our findings in relation with economic constraints and <b>provide</b> <b>advices</b> to encourage farmers using simple devices that will improve both production and chicken survival...|$|E

The development of basic professional competence for general practitioners is the main goal of on-the-job training program. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the needs of and the challenges to on-the-job training for general practitioners, and to <b>provide</b> <b>advices</b> for policy-makers to carry out this program more effectively. METHODS: We conducted 3 nominal group techniques, 17 in-depth interviews and 3 focus groups to identify the status of, needs of and challenges to on-the-job training for general practitioners in Liaoning, Ningxia, and Fujian provinces from September 2011 until December 2011. Audiotapes and transcripts were analyzed to identify major themes. Content analysis of the data was completed from January 2012 to March 2012. RESULTS: Basic theoretical knowledge and clinical skills were the main needs for general practitioners during on-the-job training. The challenges during training included the time contradiction between work and training, deficiencies of qualified preceptors, and lack of training funds. Participants gave recommendations how to resolve the above problems. CONCLUSIONS: In order to improve the outcomes of general practice on-the-job training, it is necessary for government officials to resolve the contradiction between work and training, train preceptors continuously, and increase financial support in the training program...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAdvanced process-based {{applications}} such as crisis and risk management require Emergent, Collaborative and Flexible (ECF) processes. These three features correspond to specific real-world requirements. Firstly, to face unpredictable situations, emergent processes are needed, i. e. processes whose model/schema is (partially) unknown at design-time and gradually defined/refined at run-time. Secondly, {{the complexity of the}} application domain being addressed requires collaborative processes, i. e. processes whose definition and enactment require interactions between groups of actors using their skills and experiences to make the process convergence towards their common goal. Thirdly, to adapt to the frequent changes that occur in their operating environment, flexible processes are needed, i. e. processes whose model/schema can be modified in real time. The objective {{of this paper is to}} present a literature review to study the state of the art of process-based systems with a focus on the three above mentioned properties. Our approach is to specify real world requirements, then to discuss the adequacy of current systems to these requirements and finally to <b>provide</b> <b>advices</b> for their improvement. Examined systems fall within the following areas: Business Process Management (BPM), Adaptive Case Management (ACM), Computer Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW) and Knowledge Management (KM).

40|$|Residential energy {{consumption}} (REC) {{is the second}} largest energy use category (10 %) in China and urban residents account {{for most of the}} REC. Understanding the underlying drivers of variations of urban REC thus helps to identify challenges and opportunities and <b>provide</b> <b>advices</b> for future policy measures. This paper applies the logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) to a decomposition of China’s urban REC during the period of 1998 - 2007 at disaggregated product/activity level using data collected {{from a wide range of}} sources. Our results have shown an extensive structure change towards a more energy-intensive household consumption structure as well as an intensive structure change towards high-quality and cleaner energy such as electricity, oil, and natural gas, which reflects a changing life style and consumption mode in pursuit of a higher level of comfort, convenience and environmental protection. We have also found that China’s price reforms in the energy sector have contributed to a reduction of REC while scale factors including increased urban population and income levels have played a key role in the rapid growth of REC. We suggest that further deregulation in energy prices and regulatory as well as voluntary energy efficiency and conservation policies in the residential sector should be promoted.

40|$|Purpose/Objectives: To {{assess what}} {{percentage}} of oncology nurses perceived themselves as having insuffcient knowledge to <b>provide</b> <b>advice</b> on nutrition and/or physical activity (PA), which characteristics were associated with nurses' perception, and whether the content and information sources differed among those nurses. Design: A cross-sectional study. Setting: A web-based survey among oncology nurses in the Netherlands. Sample: 355 oncology nurses <b>provided</b> <b>advice</b> on nutrition; of these, 327 <b>provided</b> <b>advice</b> on PA. Methods: From May to July 2013, oncology nurses were invited to complete an online questionnaire. Pearson's chi-squared tests and uni-and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted. Main Research Variables: Oncology nurses' perception of having suffcient or insuffcient knowledge {{to be able to}} <b>provide</b> <b>advice</b> on nutrition and PA, the content of the advice, and the information sources on which the advice was based. Findings: 43 % of oncology nurses perceived themselves as having insuffcient knowledge to <b>provide</b> <b>advice</b> on nutrition, and 46 % perceived insuffcient knowledge to <b>provide</b> <b>advice</b> on PA. Factors associated with perceiving insuffcient knowledge on nutrition were being aged younger, having lower education, and providing counseling during treatment only. Those nurses were more likely to suggest taking oral nutritional supplements or visiting a dietitian and were less likely to provide information on fluid intake. Nurses perceiving insuffcient knowledge about PA used oncology guidelines less often. Conclusions: Almost half of the oncology nurses <b>providing</b> <b>advice</b> on nutrition and PA perceived themselves as having insuffcient knowledge to be able to <b>provide</b> such <b>advice.</b> In particular, younger oncology nurses and oncology nurses with an intermediate vocational education may beneft most from education about these topics. Implications for Nursing: Educational training for oncology nurses should include nutrition and PA. Oncology nurses should collaborate with dietitians to discuss what information should be provided to patients by whom, and specifc PA <b>advice</b> should be <b>provided</b> by a physical therapist. </p...|$|R
40|$|How {{to design}} {{automated}} procedures which (i) accurately assess {{the knowledge of}} a student, and (ii) efficiently <b>provide</b> <b>advices</b> for further study? To produce well-founded answers, Knowledge Space Theory relies on a combinatorial viewpoint on the assessment of knowledge, and thus departs from common, numerical evaluation. Its assessment procedures fundamentally differ from other current ones (such as those of S. A. T. and A. C. T.). They are adaptative (taking into account the possible correctness of previous answers from the student) and they produce an outcome which is far more informative than a crude numerical mark. This chapter recapitulates the main concepts underlying Knowledge Space Theory and its special case, Learning Space Theory. We begin by describing the combinatorial core of the theory, {{in the form of}} two basic axioms and the main ensuing results (most of which we give without proofs). In practical applications, learning spaces are huge combinatorial structures which may be difficult to manage. We outline methods providing efficient and comprehensive summaries of such large structures. We then describe the probabilistic part of the theory, especially the Markovian type processes which are instrumental in uncovering the knowledge states of individuals. In the guise of the ALEKS system, which includes a teaching component, these methods have been used by millions of students in schools and colleges, and by home schooled students. We summarize some of the results of these applications...|$|E

Attempts to identify what is patient experience, the relationship with nursing care, {{and the application of}} patient experience in nursing quality improvement practice, in order to <b>provide</b> <b>advices</b> for constructing the quality standards and quality improvement strategies of nursing care. Methods: We conducted a literature review of original research publications. The database platforms Pubmed, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Wanfang were searched from inception until end of August 2015. After screening retrieved articles, 40 sources (articles and organizational websites) were selected for analysis for the connotation, development and application of patient experience in nursing quality researches. Results: Our study identified several concepts about patient experience, roughly sorted out the development path of patient experience in worldwide and the application of patient experience in nursing quality improvement. It points out four precautions when applying patient experience in nursing quality improvement, which are differentiating patient satisfaction and patient experience, choosing appropriate data collection method and appropriate feedback time, and the last but the most important, applying theories to actual clinical practice. Conclusions: Professional indexes are important to maintain the care quality, but it cannot fully reflect quality of nursing care, which needs patient experience as the supplement. Nursing staffs need to make more efforts to enhance patient's nursing care experience, and apply the research results to clinical practice, and finally make patient-centered care come true. For future study, the evaluation system and management strategies about patient experience need to be developed to guide nursing quality improvement...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} {{level of}} managerial control {{systems in the}} Romanian public entities is not a remarkable one, on the contrary, some institutions {{do not understand the}} real usefulness of the internal control system and the related set of standards; the compliance is determined only by the regulatory norms. The practice of implementing the internal control proves that the perception of executives and middle managers regarding that system is not a favourable and supporting one. The managers face difficulties caused by the ambiguity of some of the standards, poorly understood, and for which the body of laws does not <b>provide</b> <b>advices.</b> Thus, some institutions report the high compliance of standards, although the reality shows numerous inconsistencies. Other public institutions assess their own level of implementation only partially, but do not identify improvement solutions. Because of the lacking of benchmarking initiatives and knowledge transferring between institutions, the picture of this situation indicates dysfunctions that influence the efficiency of the activities and the achievement of the objectives. In this paper, we will analyze the correlation between the observed shortcomings in the implementation of three of the most important standards, namely the Reporting improprieties, the Information and the Communication. The methodology used is an analytical and exploratory one and critically examines the implementation status of these three standards in more than 40 public institutions in Dolj County, Romania. Also, by analyzing the answers to the questionnaire, our study identifies differences in interpretation and implementation of these standards between certain types of organizations (given the heterogeneity of the investigated sample). The results show a high interdependence between this control standards and our proposals focus on the strengthening of the interpersonal skills and the personal relationships.
