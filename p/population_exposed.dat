500|$|In January 1942, SS-Untersturmführer Herbert Andorfer was {{appointed}} to replace the inexperienced Enge as commander of the camp. Enge was subsequently made Andorfer's deputy. That month, German military authorities demanded the camp be cleared of Jews {{in order to accommodate}} the growing number of captives taken in battles with the Partisans. By February the camp held about 6,500 inmates, ten percent of whom were Romani. In early March, Andorfer was informed that a gas van had been sent to the camp from Berlin. The Sauer van had been delivered upon the request of the German military administration chief in Serbia, Harald Turner. Stricken with guilt over having to {{play a central role in}} the murder of the Jewish inmates, some of whom he had developed good relations with, Andorfer requested a transfer; this was denied. In order to ensure the quickness and efficiency of the gassings, he made announcements intended to convince the prisoners that they were going to be transferred to another, better-equipped camp. He went so far as to post fictitious camp regulations, and announced that prisoners would be allowed to take their bags with them. Many detainees registered for the supposed transfer, hoping to escape the camp's terrible living conditions. Inmates who had volunteered to leave the previous evening climbed into the van the next day in groups of between 50 and 80. The drivers of the van, SS-Scharführers Meier and Götz, distributed candy to children in order to win their affection. Afterwards, the doors of the van were sealed shut. The van then followed a small car driven by Andorfer and Enge, before crossing the border into German-occupied Serbia. It was here that one of the drivers exited the van and crawled underneath it, diverting its exhaust into the interior of the vehicle and killing the inmates with carbon monoxide gas. The van was then taken to the Avala firing range, where corpses were dumped into mass graves freshly dug by Serbian and Romani prisoners. Such gassings became routine, and the gas van arrived every day except Sunday. Rumours quickly circulated about the gassings, with news reaching German troops stationed in Belgrade and even some Serbians. Consequently, the gas van was nicknamed the [...] "soul killer" [...] (...) by the Serb <b>population</b> <b>exposed</b> to these rumours. It is thought that the gassings took the lives of as many as 8,000 inmates, mostly women and children. The seven Serbian prisoners that had participated in unloading the murdered inmates from the van were shot after the gassings stopped, but the gravedigger, a Serb named Vladimir Milutinović, survived. [...] "Eighty-one or eighty-two trenches were prepared and I helped dig all of them," [...] he recalled. [...] "At least 100 people [...] into each trench These ones were only for those suffocated in the truck. We dug a different set for those who were shot." ...|$|E

2500|$|By {{the end of}} the war {{deterioration}} of the Southern infrastructure was widespread. The number of civilian deaths is unknown. Every Confederate state was affected, but most of the war was fought in Virginia and Tennessee, while Texas and Florida saw the least military action. Much of the damage was caused by direct military action, but most was caused by lack of repairs and upkeep, and by deliberately using up resources. Historians have recently estimated how much of the devastation was caused by military action. [...] Paul Paskoff calculates that Union military operations were conducted in 56% of 645 counties in nine Confederate states (excluding Texas and Florida).

2500|$|A June 2012 Stanford University study estimated, using {{a linear}} no-threshold model, that the {{radioactivity}} {{release from the}} Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant could cause 130 deaths from cancer globally (the lower bound for the estimate being 15 and the upper bound 1100) and 199 cancer cases in total (the lower bound being 24 and the upper bound 1800), {{most of which are}} estimated to occur in Japan.

2500|$|In {{the natural}} environment, Wolbachia and the Asian tiger {{mosquito}} {{are in a}} symbiotic relationship, so both species benefit {{from each other and}} can evolve together. The relationship between Wolbachia and its host might not have always been mutualistic, as Drosophila populations once experienced decreased fecundity in infected females, suggesting that Wolbachia evolved over time so that infected individuals would actually reproduce much more. The mechanism by which Wolbachia is inherited through maternal heredity is called cytoplasmic incompatibility. This changes the gamete cells of males and females, making some individuals unable to mate with each other. Although little is known about why cytoplasmic incompatibility exists, [...] Wolbachia infection creates a fitness advantage for infected females, as they can mate with either infected or uninfected males. Despite this, infected males cannot reproduce with uninfected females. Therefore, over time, a <b>population</b> <b>exposed</b> to Wolbachia [...] transitions from a few infected individuals to all individuals becoming infected, as the males that cannot reproduce successfully do not contribute to future generations. [...] This is called population replacement, where the population’s overall genotype is replaced by a new genotype. This shows how populations of Asian tiger mosquitoes can vary in number of Wolbachia-infected individuals, based on how often the infection is transmitted. Due to Wolbachia's ability to transmit from one host to the next, it can change the average genotype of a population, potentially reducing the population's gene flow with other nearby populations.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1974 Sixteen {{populations of}} guppies (Poecilia reticulata) were {{established}} in laboratory aquariums. Eight <b>populations</b> were <b>exposed</b> to dieldrin at a mean concentration of 0. 525 ppb {{in the water and}} 2. 11 ppm in the food, tubificid worms. Eight populations received control water and food. All populations were fed three grams of tubificid worms per day. Exploitation rates of 0. 60, 0. 45, 0. 30, and 0. 15 were selected. Each rate was assigned to two control populations and two <b>populations</b> <b>exposed</b> to dieldrin. All fish except the young (less than nine millimeters) in each population were exploited at their designated rate according to a systematic exploitation schedule every 28 days. All populations were exploited fifteen times. The number of fish in the exploited phase of populations exploited at 0. 60 remained stable during most of the experiment. <b>Populations</b> <b>exposed</b> to dieldrin maintained a greater number of fish than control populations through increased recruitment. Apparently, dieldrin reduced the cannibalistic behavior of adult guppies and allowed more young to survive to recruitment size. The biomass and yield in weight of control <b>populations</b> and <b>populations</b> <b>exposed</b> to dieldrin was similar. Increased recruitment in <b>populations</b> <b>exposed</b> to dieldrin was therefore compensated by reduced growth. Reductions in recruitment resulting from increased cannibalism on young fish caused the number of fish in the exploited phase of populations exploited at 0. 45, 0. 30, and 0. 15 to decline. <b>Populations</b> <b>exposed</b> to dieldrin maintained the same number of fish and followed the same trends as control populations. These populations maintained a high density of adult fish and intraspecific competition for food may have overcome the tendency of dieldrin to reduce cannibalistic behavior. Although population number declined, the biomass and yield in weight of these populations remained stable. Reductions in recruitment had not yet caused a major {{decline in the number of}} adults and may have been compensated by increased fish growth. As population number declined, the average length and weight of the catch increased. Populations exploited at 0. 45, 0. 30, and 0. 15 were apparently beginning to undergo periodic cycles. Mean equilibrium yield in weight declined as exploitation rate was reduced. Yield in weight of each population was located on the descending limb of a surplus-yield curve. Age, growth, production, and yield in weight of females in populations exploited at 0. 60, 0. 45, and 0. 30 were determined from the length-frequency distributions of the catch. At each exploitation rate, during the younger age classes, when the production of a cohort of females was greater than its yield, the biomass of the cohort increased. During the older age classes, when yield became greater than production, the biomass of the cohort declined. As exploitation rate increased, the mean individual weight of each age class and the relative growth rate of fish of a particular weight also increased. Increased growth enabled fish from high exploitation rates to maintain greater production and yield than fish from low exploitation rates...|$|R
