25|$|There is {{only one}} Large Scale {{industry}} in this district, i.e. M/s Kudremukh Iron Ore Company Ltd. (KIOCL) in Kudremukh area of Mudigere Taluk. KIOCL was established in 1976 to develop the Kudremukh mine and to produce 7.5 million tonnes of concentrate per year. The facilities were commissioned in 1980 and the first shipment of concentrate was made in October 1981. A <b>pelletisation</b> <b>plant</b> with a capacity of 3 million tonnes per year was commissioned in 1987 for production of high quality blast furnace and direct reduction grade pellets for export. KIOCL received a massive setback when its mining licence expired and operations were stopped by the Supreme Court with effect from 31 December 2005. With many of the employees losing their jobs and the social backlash that may result thereof, efforts are being made to generate jobs for these workers in other areas.|$|E
50|$|KIOCL ltd., is a Government of India {{enterprise}} {{with its}} head office in Bangalore. It has iron ore mines in Kudremukh (Chikkamagaluru district) on the Western Ghats and a <b>pelletisation</b> <b>plant</b> in Mangalore. The Kudremukh mine {{is one of}} the largest iron ore mines in the world.|$|E
50|$|The {{administrative}} {{activities of}} KIOCL {{are carried out}} from Bangalore. The mining takes place at western ghats at Kudremukh. The mined ore is transported through water pipelines running through the districts of Udupi and Dakshina Kannada up to the plant in Panambur, adjacent to the premises of New Mangalore Port in Mangalore. The ore is pelletised in the <b>pelletisation</b> <b>plant.</b> The pellets are shipped to countries like China, Iran, Japan, and Taiwan.|$|E
40|$|Executive summary This Reference Document on best {{available}} techniques in the Iron and Steel Industry reflects an information exchange carried out according to Article 16 (2) of Council Directive 96 / 61 /EC. The document has {{to be seen in}} the light of the preface, which describes the objectives of the document and its use. Scope It covers the environmental aspects of iron and steel making in integrated steelworks (sinter <b>plants,</b> <b>pelletisation</b> <b>plants,</b> coke oven plants, blast furnaces and basic oxygen furnaces including continuous or ingot casting) and electric arc furnace steelmaking. Ferrous metal processing downstream to casting is not covered in this document. Submitted information The most important environmental issues of iron and steelmaking relate to emissions to air and to solid wastes/by-products. Wastewater emissions from coke oven plants, blast furnaces and basic oxygen furnaces are the most relevant emissions to water in this sector. It is no surprise, therefore, that there is good information available on these aspects but only limited information is available about noise/vibration emissions and related measures to minimise them. The same is for soil pollution, health & safety and also for natural aspects. Inaddition, little information is available on the sampling methods, analysis methods, time intervals, computation methods and reference conditions used as a basis for the data submitted...|$|R
40|$|The BREF {{entitled}} ‘Iron and Steel Production’ forms part of {{a series}} presenting the results of an exchange of information between EU Member States, the industries concerned, non-governmental organisations promoting environmental protection and the Commission, to draw up, review, and where necessary, update BAT reference documents as required by Article 13 (1) of the Directive. This document is published by the European Commission pursuant to Article 13 (6) of the Directive. This BREF for the iron and steel production industry covers the following specified in Annex I to Directive 2010 / 75 /EU, namely: •	activity 1. 3 : coke production •	activity 2. 1 : metal ore (including sulphide ore) roasting and sintering •	activity 2. 2 : production of pig iron or steel (primary or secondary fusion) including continuous casting, with a capacity exceeding 2. 5 tonnes per hour. The document also covers some activities that may be directly associated to these activities on the same site. Important issues for the implementation of Directive 2010 / 75 /EU in the production of iron and steel are the reduction of emissions to air; efficient energy and raw material usage; minimisation, recovery and the recycling of process residues; as well as effective environmental and energy management systems. The BREF document contains 13 chapters. Chapter 1 provides general information on the iron and steel sector. Chapter 2 provides information and data on general industrial processes used within this sector. Chapters 3 to 8 provide information on particular iron and steel processes (sinter <b>plants,</b> <b>pelletisation,</b> coke ovens, blast furnaces, basic oxygen steelmaking and casting, electric arc steelmaking and casting). In Chapter 9 the BAT conclusions, as defined in Article 3 (12) of the Directive, are presented for the sectors described in Chapters 2 to 8. JRC. J. 5 -Sustainable Production and Consumptio...|$|R
