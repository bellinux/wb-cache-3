50|$|Prescribed burning is an {{attractive}} and widely used conservation tool among land managers today. The historic role that fire played in the prairie landscape is important and can be highly beneficial to many plant species. Prescribed burns have also become a popular low-cost alternative for removing woody vegetation on rural and agricultural lands (Powell et al. 2006). However, {{there has been some}} evidence that heavy fire management used on prairie lands can negatively affect the regal fritillary. A study conducted by Powell et al. (2006) examined the effects of prescribed prairie burns by surveying a number of prairies in Kansas. Butterflies were observed on both recently burned and unburned sites {{to determine the effects of}} prescribed burning on the populations. Population density of the regal fritillary may tend to vary among sites but was generally quite a bit higher at sites that had not been burned in the past year (Powell et al. 2006). Prescribed burns are usually conducted in the early spring while the first instar larvae remain vulnerable, buried in the leaf litter. Extensive prairie burns kill the overwintering larvae and can have a drastic effect on their population in the following years. One recently burned prairie that was studied used minimal <b>patch</b> <b>burning</b> by burning only small portions of the entire area at a time. This site had by far the highest regal fritillary abundance of any burned site (Powell et al. 2006).|$|E

30|$|As {{to whether}} the {{commercial}} fire paradigm is incorporating communal knowledge in wildland fire management, {{there is evidence to}} show that this is occurring in some cases. The use of the patch mosaic burning system in the Pilansberg National Park and its adoption in the Kruger National Park in South Africa follows the method of burning used in the communal fire paradigm practiced by local African communities throughout Africa. While the use of patch mosaic burning in the Pilansberg National Park originated from Aboriginal fire practices in Uluru and Kakadu national parks in northern Australia, it is not in conflict with the patch mosaic burning system used in the communal fire paradigm. In the case of the Kruger National Park, <b>patch</b> <b>burning</b> has been accepted because of its widespread use and perceived positive ecological effects in neighbouring Mozambique, where communal livestock farming is practiced. Therefore, the commercial fire paradigm is incorporating indigenous knowledge in wildland fire management.|$|E

40|$|AbstractReduction of {{fire hazard}} is {{becoming}} increasingly important in managed landscapes globally. Fuels reduction prescribed burn treatments {{are the most common}} form of reducing fire hazard on landscapes around the world but often result in homogenized fuel age structures and habitats. Alternatively, the size of unplanned fires, and hence fire hazard, can be reduced by controlling the size and patterning of fuels treatments in a patch mosaic arrangement on landscapes. <b>Patch</b> mosaic <b>burning</b> is being implemented globally as a means to increase heterogeneity to mimic natural fire regime results. Funding for prescribed fire programs is often justified primarily on hazardous fuels reduction with secondary consideration given for ecological effectiveness, which can be increased by particular fire mosaic patterns in some systems. The question we address is: Which of two prescribed fire treatment regimes, fuels reduction or <b>patch</b> mosaic <b>burning,</b> reduces fire hazard most effectively? We address the question using computer simulation modeling on synthetic landscapes representing both fire regime treatments. Treatment scale was important. Among fuel reduction treatments, large blocks burned less area than small blocks. For the mosaic treatments, small blocks reduced fire size the most (out of all treatments) and had the least variance in area burned. It is possible to reduce fire hazard and to provide heterogeneous age fuels structure on the landscape, simultaneously benefiting humans and many native fire-dependent species requiring mosaic habitat patterns...|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, it must {{be stated}} that there are, however, {{certain aspects of the}} {{communal}} fire paradigm that need to be modified in the light of research results that form part of the commercial fire paradigm. For example, the use of <b>patch</b> mosaic <b>burning</b> in the communal fire paradigm minimises the occurrence of surface head fires necessary for the control of encroaching tree and shrub species. It would therefore be highly beneficial for local communal communities to use perimeter ignitions (block burns) rather than point ignitions (patch burns) in situations where it is necessary to use fire to control the encroachment of tree and shrub species. Also, the practice in the communal fire paradigm of applying immediate grazing with livestock after a burn without including a regular rotational resting program is highly detrimental to range condition and needs to be adapted as a means of ensuring the continued ecological health and ecosystem functioning of the communal rangelands in Africa.|$|R
30|$|A {{growing body}} of {{research}} has shown that Aboriginal fire use is skilful and responsible for the functioning of ecosystems that were encountered by European colonists (Bowman 1998). A prime example of the importance of Aboriginal fire management concerns the ecological effects when this tradition of fire management is disrupted. For example, across large areas of northern Australia’s savannas, the cessation of Aboriginal fire management has resulted in the decline of the cypress pine (Callitris intratropica R.T. Baker and H.G. Smith), a fire sensitive obligate seeder (Bowman and Panton 1993). Mature trees have thick bark and can survive mild but not intense fires and, if stems are killed, has no capacity for vegetative recovery. Seedlings cannot survive even the coolest fires. The survival of cypress pine was a consequence of Aboriginal <b>patch</b> <b>burning</b> that occurred for a number of reasons, including but not limited to preserving patches of wild yams (Russell-Smith et al. 1997), managing country for spiritual obligations (Yibarbuk et al. 2001), preserving unburnt areas for fire drives of wild game later in the year (Haynes 1985), and maintaining grazing habitat for game (Murphy and Bowman 2007). It seems that the creation of habitat heterogenity was critical for the survival of a range of plants and animals that are currently undergoing precipitous declines following the cessation of Aboriginal fire management (Franklin 1999, Woinarski et al. 2010).|$|E
40|$|The Nebraska Sandhills {{grassland}} is an expansive, semi-arid ecosystem {{characterized by}} vegetation-stabilized rolling sand dunes. The Sandhills grassland is managed for livestock production by seeking to minimizing disturbances, such as fire, that increase bare ground. The increase in bare ground following fire {{has contributed to}} the fear of fire leading to the emergence of a mobile sand dune state. We tracked vegetation response following a growing season wildfire that occurred during extreme drought conditions. In wildfire and drought conditions are when one would expect resilience to be overcome leading to a lack of vegetation recovery and a transition to a mobile sand dune state. However, aboveground herbaceous biomass recovered to unburned levels after two years and resisted a transition to an undesirable plant community. Next, we assessed the potential for focal fire and grazing to create heterogeneity of grassland structure and composition in order to increase biodiversity. Using <b>patch</b> <b>burning,</b> discrete patches were burned annually and grazers were allowed to select between recently burned and unburned areas. We found the Sandhills grassland is spatially homogeneous in vegetation structure and composition with greater structural heterogeneity emerging temporally in the transition from growing to dormant season. However, temporal heterogeneity manifests as an artifact of how vegetation was classified. Although live herbaceous vegetation decreases in the transition to dormant season, grassland vegetation structure is only slightly affected because herbaceous standing dead vegetation increases as a result of herbaceous vegetation senescence.

The present study applies the conceptual model of a hierarchy of causes to Lasiopetalum pterocarpum E. M. Benn. K. Shep. (a critically endangered species) to understand better its reproductive and ecological attributes, possible reasons for its rarity and to determine whether this model assists in developing management strategies. L. pterocarpum subpopulations from Serpentine National Park were censused to record abundance, plant health, phenology, flower and fruit production {{and the presence of}} any seed bank. These characteristics were matched to criteria in the hierarchies of cause model. There was no evidence of recent seedling recruitment at any subpopulation. Hand-pollination produced a flower-to-fruit conversion proportion similar to that found in the field and self- and cross-pollinations produced virtually the same fruit set. Seed store in soil from beneath the native subpopulations and at a translocation site showed seed was patchily distributed and infrequent. L. pterocarpum is an obligate seeder, killed by fire and dependent on disturbance to break seed dormancy. However, smoke has no effect on germination. Seed production does not constrain population growth, because seedling regeneration after fire in 1999 was prolific at sites where plants had been growing. In the hierarchies of cause framework, the main causes of rarity for this species are taxon ecology, life-history strategy and stochasticity.

In this study, fire frequency and fire return intervals were modelled over a 12 -year time series (1997 – 2008) for the Jalapão State Park, a protected area in the north of the Cerrado, based on burned area maps derived from Landsat imagery. Burned areas were classified using object based image analysis.

Over the study period, an area equivalent to four times the size of Jalapão State Park burned and the mean annual area burned was 34 %. Median fire intervals were generally short, ranging from three to six years. Shrub savannas had the shortest fire intervals, and dense woodlands the longest.

40|$|Climate {{change is}} a result of {{greenhouse}} gases released into the atmosphere. These changes are expected to cause extreme weather conditions, including severe storms. Large amounts of rain will fall in shorter periods of time, leading to heavy runoff, and increasing the severity of drought conditions within the soil (Zeglin et al. 2013). Native grasslands occupy almost a quarter of the earth’s land surface and are valuable ecological resources. They contain soils with high concentrations of organic matter and {{play a key role in}} mitigating greenhouse gas emissions through carbon sequestration. There are a variety of grassland management techniques including annual burning, <b>patch</b> <b>burning,</b> and cattle grazing. These management techniques can be beneficial for ecosystems, but can also alter soil compositions (Jerome et al. 2014). Microbial communities in the soil influence many ecosystem processes such as nutrient acquisition, carbon and nitrogen cycling, and soil formation (Heijden et al. 2008). Changes in precipitation patterns can effect microbes in these grasslands by causing shifts in community composition, and changes in nutrient cycling and decomposition processes. Many microbial activities can be directly correlated with water availability, and drought conditions may be detrimental to these grazed grassland ecosystems (Gray et al. 2011). Summer months and differences in time lead to changes in temperatures and rainfall patters, similarly having the potential to alter activity and structure of microbial communities. This study was conducted at the Konza Prairie Biological Station in eastern Kansas, USA. Soil samples were collected to compare June versus July and moist versus dry treatments. Findings from this study concluded that seasonal changes through June and July alter microbial communities in Konza Prairie soil. Total PLFA concentrations significantly increased, with the largest increase occurring in fungi. This change caused a decrease in relative abundance of gram positive and gram negative bacteria, and also an increase in the ratio of fungi to bacteria. Drought conditions caused no significant change in microbial communities, suggesting the microbes in the soil have a high tolerance for lack of moisture...|$|E
40|$|Discolouration {{of natural}} surface waters {{due to the}} humic {{component}} of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is a costly problem for water supply companies. This paper reviews {{what is known about}} the impacts of prescribed moorland vegetation burning on water colour. Relevant research has taken place at three scales: laboratory experiments on peat cores, plot scale sampling of soil waters and catchment scale sampling of stream waters. While laboratory studies suggest burning increases colour production, the evidence from catchment and plot studies is contradictory. Plot studies suggest colour production may decrease or remain unchanged following burning although there is evidence for some transient changes. Catchment studies suggest prescribed moorland burning causes stream water colour to increase, although in most cases the evidence is not clear cut since most studies could not clearly disentangle the effects of burning from those of vegetation cover. The differences in findings between plot and catchment studies may be explained by: i) the short-term nature of some studies which do not measure long-term response and recovery times to burning; ii) the lack of colour measurements from shallow soil depths which contribute more to streamflow than soil water from deeper in the peat; and iii) the possibility of hydrological interactions occurring between different experimental plots at some sites. Additionally, the increase in recent <b>patch</b> <b>burning</b> in some catchments that has been statistically attributed by some authors to increases in stream water colour cannot be reconciled with theoretical calculations. When dilution with waters derived {{from other parts of the}} catchment are taken into account, large values of colour have to be theoretically derived from those recently burnt areas that occupy a small proportion of the catchment area in order to balance the change in stream water colour observed in recent years. Therefore, much further process-based work is required to properly investigate whether prescribed vegetation burning is a direct driver of enhanced colour and DOC in upland streams, rivers and lakes...|$|E
40|$|Vegetation {{management}} {{is not a}} new concept to many Aboriginal people. Traditional vegetation management practices such as <b>patch</b> <b>burning</b> required a thorough understanding of the ecology of vegetation communities, vegetation succession, and the associated fauna. Burning was not carried out indiscriminately but rather, informed decisions were mage in response to the vegetation type, season and the time since the last burning (Walsh 1989). It has even been said that the traditional Australian landscape was an Aboriginal artefact, maintained in its pristine form by conscious Aboriginal management (Coombs 1989). However, with European contact and the establishment of permanent Aboriginal settlements, the pattern of vegetation use by Aboriginal people living in remote settlements in the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia has undoubtedly changed. Permanent settlements of Aboriginal people have brought about an increase in the people-pressure exerted on the land and vegetation surrounding those settlements. Whereas in the times before European contact people would move on when their impact on the local vegetation and fauna became detrimental to the environment and themselves, the advent of permanent settlements with regular supplies of food and water have provided very strong incentives for Aboriginal people to remain in a degraded environment, even though the environmental impact of a concentrated population on a relatively small area is clearly severe. The practice of living a community lifestyle that degrades the local vegetation and subsequently creates health problems for the members of that community is of course not unique to Aboriginal communities. It is a problem that faces not only other users of the arid and semi-arid lands of Australia but most other communities in the world today. Nevertheless, the link between community health and the vegetation status of the surrounding environment is much more direct in remote Aboriginal commumtIes than in other communities in the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. Aboriginal people living in remote commUnIties in the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia often have a high dependance on local resources for food and firewood (Walsh 1989).

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} options for {{management}} of the savanna ecosystems of the Kruger National Park using fire. The major goals of management have shifted from attempts to use fire to achieve a stable vegetation composition, to one of recognising that savanna ecosystems are in constant flux. Fire is a major form of disturbance that helps to maintain a state of flux, and thus to conserve biodiversity. Three candidate approaches for fire management have been put forward@the lightning fire approach, the <b>patch</b> mosaic <b>burning</b> approach, and an approach based on the assessment of ecological criteria. These approaches differ in their underlying philosophies, but not necessarily in their outcomes, although this cannot be predicted with confidence. We propose, therefore, that patterns of fire frequency, season, intensity and spatial distribution be recorded and monitored, and that these patterns should serve as surrogate measures of biodiversity. Guidelines for the definition of thresholds of potential concern with regard to these patterns are discussed. The monitoring of both fire patterns and trends in plant and animal populations {{can be used to}} identify interactions between fire and the components of the ecosystem, and these in turn can be used to define a relevant research agenda. The role of management in monitoring and assessing fire patterns (previously regarded as a research responsibility) is emphasised. Convergence in the patterns of fire that result from the different management approaches could also serve as a basis for merging some or all of these approaches in order to simplify management...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies at}} some sites in {{northern}} Australia have reported severe and rapid decline of some native mammal species, notwithstanding an environmental context (small human population size, limited habitat loss, substantial reservation extent) that should provide relative conservation security. All {{of the more}} speciose taxonomic groups of mammals in northern Australia have some species for which the conservation status has been assessed as threatened, with 53 % of dasyurid, 46 % of macropod and potoroid, 33 % of bandicoot and bilby, 33 % of possum, 31 % of rodent, and 24 % of bat species being assessed as extinct, threatened or Near Threatened. This paper reviews disparate recent and ongoing studies that provide information on population trends across a broader geographic scope than the previously reported sites, and provides some information on the conservation status and trends for mammal groups (bats, larger macropods) not well sampled in previous monitoring studies. It describes some diverse approaches of studies seeking to document conservation status and trends, and {{of the factors that}} may be contributing to observed patterns of decline. The studies reported provide some compelling evidence that predation by feral cats is implicated in the observed decline, with those impacts likely to be exacerbated by prevailing fire regimes (frequent, extensive and intense fire), by reduction in ground vegetation cover due to livestock and, in some areas, by ‘control’ of dingoes. However the impacts of dingoes may be complex, and are not yet well resolved in this area. The relative impacts of these individual factors vary spatially (with most severe impacts in lower rainfall and less topographically rugged areas) and between different mammal species, with some species responding idiosyncratically: the most notable example is the rapid decline of the northern quoll Dasyurus hallucatus due to poisoning by the introduced cane toad Rhinella marina, which continues to spread extensively across northern Australia. The impact of disease, if any, remains unresolved. Recovery of the native mammal fauna may be impossible in some areas. However, there are now examples of rapid recovery following threat management. Priority conservation actions include: enhanced biosecurity for important islands, establishment of a network of substantial predator exclosures, intensive fire management (aimed at increasing the extent of longer-unburnt habitat and in delivering fine scale <b>patch</b> <b>burning),</b> reduction in feral stock in conservation reserves, and acquisition for conservation purposes of some pastoral lands in areas that are significant for mammal conservation...|$|E
40|$|Introduction and aims: Great desert skinks (Liopholis slateri) {{are unique}} Australian desert lizards that build and inhabit {{communal}} burrows. They {{are listed as}} vulnerable under the EPBC Act 1999 and uncontrolled wildfire and introduced predators {{are considered to be}} key threatening processes. Particularly, it is thought that reduced cover associated with fire makes skinks more vulnerable to predation. One of the stronghold populations for the species at Uluṟu-Kata Tjuṯa National Park (UKTNP) has been significantly affected by wildfire in the past decade. <b>Patch</b> <b>burning</b> is currently implemented around known great desert skink burrows at UKTNP to prevent further wildfires occurring. In this thesis I examine the distribution, habitat selection and behaviour of great desert skinks in relation to fire, vegetation cover and other habitat attributes. I aimed to test whether (a) the distribution of great desert skinks at UKTNP is linked to specific fire regimes, (b) active skink burrows are associated with particular vegetation or soil attributes, and (c) the behaviour and activity levels of skinks, including their response to predators, varies depending on the vegetation cover at burrows. Methods: I conducted systematic, replicated, unbiased searches for skink burrows in three different fire histories (recent wildfire, prescribed burn areas, and 12 year unburnt) and in accordance with the current and past known distributions of skinks in the park. To assess habitat selection, I chose 59 active burrows, approximately 70 % of the known active population in the park. Vegetation cover and soil surface assessments were made at burrows and at paired control sites with no burrows. Twelve burrows with different vegetation were selected for behavioural observations. Activity of great desert skinks and predator visits at the main entrances of these burrows was monitored using time lapse photography; one photo per minute for 18 days in each of the early and late active seasons. Comparative use of entrances within a single burrow system was investigated at two additional burrows over four days in the late active season. Results and conclusions: Only eleven burrows were found in over 90 km of searching and this low success rate made it impossible to draw specific conclusions about skink distribution in relation to fire at UKTNP. However, comparisons between habitat attributes at burrows and controls suggested skinks may be selecting for higher cover, as burrow sites had significantly higher cover and {{were more likely to be}} associated with shrub species than control sites. Soil properties also differed between burrows and control sites. Activity of great desert skinks was highly variable among burrows, as was predator occurrence. I found no significant relationship between vegetation cover and predator visits to burrows or the response of skinks to predators. There were also no significant differences in overall activity between burrows with high and low vegetation cover, however skinks spent proportionally more time exposed (outside the burrow) when cover was greater at the burrow or particular entrance. This may represent an adjustment of behaviour in response to the perceived threat of predation...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} ecology {{of one of the}} best known Australian marsupials, the Common Brushtail Possum Trichosurus vulpecula, in central Australia. Trichosurus vulpecula is one of few {{medium-sized}} mammal species that persist in arid Australia today. Its distribution within the arid zone has declined markedly since European settlement. Two populations, one within the East MacDonnell Ranges along the Hale River and the other on Irving Creek, a River Red Gum creek in the Petermann Ranges, were studied in the southern Northern Territory. Others locations in the region were visited opportunistically. Trie central Australian Trichosurus is not distinct genetically from populations elsewhere in Australia. The diet of T. vulpecula consisted of a range of leaves, flowers and fruits of perennial dicotyledonous species as well as some ephemeral herbs. Grasses were absent from the diet. Variation in the diet reflected seasonal availability in flowers and fruits. The species preferentially consumed at each site had significantly higher moisture content and dry matter digestibility than species not consumed. Preferred species included Amyema maidenii leaves (a mistletoe), Acacia spp. flowers and fruits, Santalum lanceolatum leaves (a shrub), Marsdenia australis leaves (a vine), Solarium quadriloculatum fruit (shrub) and Euphorbia spp. leaves (herb). Small amounts of invertebrate material were consumed throughout the year. Other non-plant material consumed included honeycomb and unfledged birds eg. Budgerigars. There {{were no significant differences in}} the diet between the sexes. Trichosurus vulpecula were found in six main habitats: Acacia aneura/Callitris glaucophylla on rocky hills; E. camaldulensis sandy creek-lines; mixed Acacia rocky hills, Rocky Eucalyptus creek-lines; Degraded drainage lines; and Wet gullies. Logistic regression modelling revealed a significant correlation between mistletoe species richness, higher levels of soil nitrogen and the presence of T. vulpecula. In habitats occupied by T. vulpecula species richness of mistletoes was associated with the absence of fire and the presence of reliable ground water supplies. Trichosurus vulpecula were highly mobile with mean home ranges at Hale River of 44. 21 ? 22. 76 ha and considerably higher than those recorded in previous studies in Australia. Mean home ranges at Irving Creek were much smaller, at 4. 99 ? 1. 46 ha and VII similar to that recorded in other studies in Australia. At both sites, males had larger home ranges and there was a high degree of overlap with other males and females. At the Hale River study site, T. vulpecula predominantly denned in caves or cavities in rocks, whereas at Irving Creek all den sites were in large Eucalyptus camaldulensis on the drainage line. Adult and pouch young sex ratios were at parity. During this study, T. vulpecula was found to breed continuously, with births recorded in almost all months. Growth of the young were more rapid than previously recorded for Trichosurus in Australia. This is interpreted as an adaptation for living in an arid environment, enabling the young to achieve independence before quality food supplies diminish. No single exotic predator or competitor was solely responsible for the decline of T. vulpecula in arid Australia, implying an interactive impact. Prey switching by dingoes from rabbits to T. vulpecula, macropods and echidnas followed the crash of rabbit populations at Hale River. Predation by dingoes on T. vulpecula was only recorded once, at the Irving Creek study site, where numbers of rabbits remained stable throughout the study. The impact of exotic herbivores occurred through habitat degradation rather than competition. Evaluation of the ecological data collected during this study generally supports current models of decline and extinction in medium-sized mammals in arid Australia, integrating the effects of predators, competitors, drought and fire. However, the importance of each factor on populations of T. vulpecula was found to vary depending on their location in the landscape. This study suggests two separate models to explain the decline of T. vulpecula in arid Australia after the arrival of Europeans. The first operates in the riparian lowlands and the second on the rocky ranges. In both models, prior to European settlement, T. vulpecula occupied refuge habitats characterised by readily available moisture for plant growth (run on areas and/or shallow water tables) and soils with higher soil nutrient concentrations. The impact of fires on these refugia was minimal, as Aboriginal burning practices protected them with mosaic burning generally preventing large-scale fires from developing. Following European settlement, the forces impacting on populations were different in the riparian lowlands from those affecting rocky ranges. In the riparian lowlands, the effects of rabbits and livestock together with predation were found to have the major impact on T. vulpecula populations. Fire was not a significant factor in these areas. In the rocky ranges, fire was the most significant factor affecting T. vulpecula populations. Introduced herbivores did not degrade these habitats as they did in the riparian lowlands because the rugged and steep nature of the ranges acted as a physical barrier. Similarly, predator numbers were lower because of the relative difficulty in moving over rough ground and the generally lower relative abundance of preferred prey such as rabbits. An adaptive management strategy needs to be implemented to determine the effects of different management regimes on T. vulpecula population viability. The key elements of a management strategy in the riparian lowlands involves the manipulation and monitoring of predators, rabbits and livestock numbers. In the rocky ranges, the key management strategy involves the implementation of a <b>patch</b> <b>burning</b> to prevent fires entering habitats occupied by T. vulpecula. Importantly, any management strategies should involve Aboriginal people. Trichosurus vulpecula is an important part of Aboriginal culture. Its decline is of great concern to many people and several of the remaining populations and potential reintroduction locations are on Aboriginal land. Because of their relationship with the land and the animals, people have both the knowledge of the animal and the skills (such as <b>patch</b> <b>burning)</b> to provide information to managers which will assist with management. To achieve these management directions a coordinated national education programme is required to inform and convince the Australian community that conservation of T. vulpecula is deserving of attention in arid and semi-arid Australia. This is particularly important given the perception that T. vulpecula is a common species throughout Australia, despite its massive decline in arid Australia since European settlement...|$|E
40|$|Burst oscillations, a {{phenomenon}} {{observed in a}} significant fraction of Type I (thermonuclear) X-ray bursts, involve the development of highly asymmetric brightness <b>patches</b> in the <b>burning</b> surface layers of accreting neutron stars. Intrinsically interesting as nuclear phenomena, they are also important as probes of dense matter physics and the strong gravity, high magnetic field environment of the neutron star surface. Burst oscillation frequency {{is also used to}} measure stellar spin, and doubles the sample of rapidly rotating (above 10 Hz) accreting neutron stars with known spins. Although the mechanism remains mysterious, burst oscillation models must take into account thermonuclear flame spread, nuclear processes, rapid rotation, and the dynamical role of the magnetic field. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the observational properties of burst oscillations, an assessment of the status of the theoretical models that are being developed to explain them, and an overview of how they can be used to constrain neutron star properties such as spin, mass and radius.

5000|$|The {{traditional}} {{account of}} Fusōs sinking {{was that she}} exploded into two halves that remained floating for some time. However, this view has been questioned recently because additional evidence has come to light. Fusō survivor Hideo Ogawa, interrogated in 1945, wrote {{an article on the}} battleship's last voyage. He says that [...] "shortly after 0400 the ship capsized slowly to starboard and Ogawa and others were washed away." [...] Fusō was hit on the starboard side by two or possibly three torpedoes. One of these started an oil fire. The fuel used by IJN ships in this period was poorly refined and had a tendency to burst into flame; <b>burning</b> <b>patches</b> of fuel were most likely the source of the story of Fusō blowing up. It is unlikely that a vessel as strongly built as a battleship could be blown in half and both halves remain upright and afloat, so the traditional version of Fusōs fate is improbable. Samuel Morison states that the bow half of Fusō was sunk by gunfire from Louisville, and the stern half sank off Kanihaan Island.|$|R
30|$|In contrast, surface {{head and}} back fires and crown fires {{are used in}} the {{communal}} fire paradigm by lighting fires as point ignitions, but there is no clear reason why point ignitions are used to ignite the fires other than convenience. Currently, point ignitions are assumed to have a greater pyrodiversity than perimeter-ignited fires. Pyrodiversity refers to the degree of variation in fire effects in terrestrial ecosystems and is assumed to promote biodiversity (Parr and Andersen 2006) because it is hypothesized that point ignitions generate more variable fires in terms of type and intensity resulting in highly diverse fire patterns, i.e., greater pyrodiversity. The effects of point ignitions versus perimeter ignitions on pyrodiversity are currently being investigated in a research project in the Kruger National Park in South Africa, referred to as the Savanna Fire Ignition Research Experiment (SavFIRE). The current fire policy in the park, involving Patch Mosaic Burning, uses point and short line ignitions as a means of promoting and maintaining biodiversity that has replaced the previous block burning program that used perimeter ignitions. This change in the fire policy in the Kruger National Park was influenced by the development of the <b>patch</b> mosaic <b>burning</b> system in the Pilansberg National Park in South Africa, where point ignitions have been used for several decades (Brockett et al. 2001). The experiment in the Kruger National Park is still in progress, but preliminary results suggest that, contrary to expectations, the major factors affecting pyrodiversity are weather conditions rather than type of ignition and size of burn. These preliminary results indicate that when burning fully cured grass fuel, the goal of greater pyrodiversity is achieved if fires are ignited when the air temperature is < 25 °C and the relative humidity > 50 %.|$|R
40|$|The {{decline of}} Northern Cypress Pine (Callitris intratropica) {{throughout}} the tropical savannas of northern Australia {{has become an}} iconic example of the ecosystem-wide effects of destructive fire regimes. The persistence of C. intratropica, a conspicuous, long-lived, obligate-seeding conifer with limited fire-tolerance, {{in one of the}} world’s most fire-prone ecosystems is ecologically puzzling. An appealing hypothesis is that habitat mosaics created by Aboriginal burning maintained enough long unburnt patches throughout the landscape for fire-sensitive plant species like C. intratropica to successfully recruit. However, widespread depopulation of Aboriginal lands within the past century across much of northern Australia has resulted in the shift from small-scale <b>patch</b> <b>burning</b> to landscape-scale wildfires. On the Arnhem Plateau, this change in fire pattern is widely blamed for current declines in C. intratropica as well as other species, notably native mammals and granivorous birds, which were able to persist for more than 50, 000 years of continuous Aboriginal occupation. Within the last several years, in an attempt to simulate Aboriginal fire regimes, contemporary managers across much of the Arnhem Plateau have implemented programs consisting of frequent burning, largely from helicopters, in the early dry season when higher fuel moisture and cooler temperatures result in smaller, patchier fires. However, continued and dramatic species declines, especially in the World Heritage listed Kakadu National Park, urgently signals the need for some means by which to better direct and monitor current strategies. If, as the above hypothesis implies, the presence of C. intratropica in Australian savannas is a relict of past fire regimes, then maintaining the species in the landscape may provide a powerful benchmark for evaluating contemporary management and conservation efforts. Therefore, this research examines the utility of C. intratropica as a proactive indicator both of ecologically beneficial fire regimes and critical habitat for other fire-sensitive species by addressing four key components: 1) Exploring the role of human management in driving habitat heterogeneity in flammable ecosystems worldwide using fire simulations and the spatial scale of C. intratropica grove occurrence as a case study 2) Patch-level assessment of the interaction between C. intratropica groves and savanna fires and its implication for vegetation heterogeneity and diversity 3) Population modelling of C. intratropica to understand the role of patch dynamics in driving population stability under prevailing and hypothetical fire regimes 4) Landscape-scale survey of C. intratropica grove condition to examine patterns of habitat heterogeneity and plant diversity across differing management regimes in Kakadu National Park (KNP) and central Arnhem Land (CAL) The results demonstrated that under low-intensity fire regimes, fire exclusion by C. intratropica groves effectively creates small-scale fire refugia, which have implications for both the persistence of C. intratropica populations as well as increasing the heterogeneity, diversity, and structural complexity of savanna vegetation. Disturbance and population models further implicated human intervention – specifically via the reduction of high intensity fires – in maintaining conditions that favour the establishment and persistence of C. intratropica, despite high fire frequencies in this savanna. Better overall C. intratropica grove condition in CAL provided evidence that continued Aboriginal fire management – and possibly the presence of feral water buffalo – supports greater savanna heterogeneity and diversity than in neighboring KNP...|$|E
30|$|Given {{the breadth}} and {{ambition}} of this book and the many exciting departures it presents in terms of modelling {{different aspects of the}} whole, it seems carping to query the extent to which this collection of papers really tackles human impacts on - and roles in creating - the Serengeti ecosystem. While drawing heavily on Ehret's (2002) inspiring grand canvas of the emergence and spread of different cultures and linguistic traditions and Iliffe's (1979) authoritative broad history, chapter 4 does little to engage with local work immediately in and around the Serengeti and across neighbouring Maasai areas - whether by historians (Waller 1988; Waller and Lamprey 1990), oral histories and anthropological work (Goldman 2003,  2009; McCabe 2002,  2003), colonial historical sources (e.g. St John Grant 1954 as cited by Pearsall 1957) or to keep up-to-date with archaeological work. As a result, the chapter is misleading in parts. It attributes the arrival of cattle in East Africa to an early introduction of the zebu Bos indicus (refuted by Marshall 2000). It lacks awareness of the way burning is managed by pastoralist and other customary users around the world (cf. work by Laris 2002; Bird et al. 2005) with the commonly observed use of controlled burning, firebreaks, <b>patch</b> <b>burning</b> and early dry-season burns to produce a mosaic-grazing resource and, importantly, to avoid damaging, uncontrolled hot fires. Classification of land use choices in chapter 4 does not do justice to the ways pastoralist individuals, households and communities have historically shifted between herding, farming, gathering, hunting and (increasingly) wage earning from off-land work, from the colonial days of working as mercenaries for British pacification raids, when they were paid in cattle, to the present situation where off-farm wages make up the second most significant source of household income (after livestock) for most rural Maasai. This poor awareness of pastoralist practices in and around the Serengeti surfaces elsewhere: in chapter 2, the Maasai are characterised as not using fencing, where St John Grant in 1954 as cited by Pearsall (1957) clearly recorded the pre-eviction Serengeti Maasai making extensive use of fences to exclude wildebeest from key short grass plains grazing and water resources; in the present day, fencing is a major issue in and around other Maasai areas (Kitengela and the Mara). Throughout the book, the 1960 s' eruption of the wildebeest is attributed solely from the release of rinderpest, but the eviction of a thousand Maasai and tens of thousands or more livestock from use of the short grass plains, along with the cessation of pastoralist practices of fencing off access to key grazing and water resources, is temporally coincident with and arguably likely to have played a part in triggering the eruption of the wild ungulates. Similarly, the 1960 s' increase in hot fires and subsequent impacts on vegetation succession is nowhere linked even in part to eviction-related loss of pastoralists' early dry-season burning and of their herds' grazing pressure. These changes would have contributed to the accumulations of dry-season fuel, making the whole system much more subject to hot dry-season fires - as observed wherever indigenous fire management has been curtailed around the world (West African savanna states, USA, Australia). Chapter 5 is unable to evaluate pastoralists as historical agents of present day heterogeneity in the landscape, despite their known role in creating key hotspots in related and neighbouring systems. Though chapters 8 and 9 suggest that the dominance of wildebeest may drive long-term decline and loss of other grazing species, competition between cattle and wildebeest and removal of wildebeest through illegal hunting are nowhere considered as possible agents maintaining diversity.|$|E
30|$|Knowledge of {{the coast}} redwood fire regime is {{important}} in order for resource managers to assess the appropriate role of fire in modern coast redwood forests. However, it is challenging for managers who wish to reintroduce fire as a disturbance process into redwood ecosystems to find a useful set of reference fire regime attributes {{on which to base}} restoration objectives. If anthropogenic burning practices affected the landscape by increasing biodiversity and influencing forest structure and composition, then prescribed burning could serve as a proxy for both pre-colonial and historical ignitions, now largely absent from the landscape (Finney and Martin 1989, Brown et al. 1999, Stephens and Fry 2005). This study suggests that managing fire for regularity based on a mean or median fire-return interval and subsequent fire-return interval departure (Caprio et al. 2002) may not be appropriate, as these metrics are only marginally illustrative of the variability of the redwood fire regime in this area. One restoration model that may prove useful is the practice of restoring cultural landscapes in which management activities are centered on incorporating components of traditional resource and environmental management (Fowler and Lepofsky 2011). This model has been successfully implemented in Redwood National Park, California, where the Bald Hills are burned regularly to maintain the ethnographic landscape (Underwood et al. 2003). In addition, opportunities for <b>patch</b> mosaic <b>burning</b> should be investigated as a means for maintaining both spatial and temporal variability of fires in this biome (Brockett et al. 2001, Stephens and Fry 2005). Resource managers will likely need to employ a suite of fire management strategies in coast redwood forests that are firmly grounded in a context of adaptive management, regardless of the restoration model used.|$|R
40|$|<b>Patch</b> mosaic <b>burning,</b> {{in which}} fire {{is used to}} produce a mosaic of habitat patches {{representative}} {{of a range of}} fire histories ('pyrodiversity'), has been widely advocated to promote greater biodiversity. However, the details of desired fire mosaics for prescribed burning programs are often unspecified. Threatened small to medium-sized mammals (35 g to 5. 5 kg) in the fire-prone tropical savannas of Australia appear to be particularly fire-sensitive. Consequently, a clear understanding of which properties of fire mosaics are most instrumental in influencing savanna mammal populations is critical. Here we use mammal capture data, remotely sensed fire information (i. e. time since last fire, fire frequency, frequency of late dry season fires, diversity of post-fire ages in 3 km radius, and spatial extent of recently burnt, intermediate and long unburnt habitat) and structural habitat attributes (including an index of cattle disturbance) to examine which characteristics of fire mosaics most influence mammals in the north-west Kimberley. We used general linear models {{to examine the relationship between}} fire mosaic and habitat attributes on total mammal abundance and richness, and the abundance of the most commonly detected species. Strong negative associations of mammal abundance and richness with frequency of late dry season fires, the spatial extent of recently burnt habitat (post-fire age < 1 year within 3 km radius) and level of cattle disturbance were observed. Shrub cover was positively related to both mammal abundance and richness, and availability of rock crevices, ground vegetation cover and spatial extent of ≥ 4 years unburnt habitat were all positively associated with at least some of the mammal species modelled. We found little support for diversity of post-fire age classes in the models. Our results indicate that both a high frequency of intense late dry season fires and extensive, recently burnt vegetation are likely to be detrimental to mammals in the north Kimberley. A managed fire mosaic that reduces large scale and intense fires, including the retention of ≥ 4 years unburnt patches, will clearly benefit savanna mammals. We also highlighted the importance of fire mosaics that retain sufficient shelter for mammals. Along with fire, it is clear that grazing by introduced herbivores also needs to be reduced so that habitat quality is maintained...|$|R
30|$|On average, 60 % of the Wyndham {{region was}} burned {{annually}} and > 50 % was burnt 5 to 6 times within nine years (Weier et al. 2016). Considering the relatively limited {{effect that the}} frequency of fire has on the density, fecundity, and seed abundance of annual Sorghum spp., {{it is unlikely that}} the current frequent fire regime will cause an appreciable impact or limitation on S. stipoideum seed availability to Gouldian finches during the breeding period (March to July; Weier et al. 2018). Lack of an apparent seed density limitation effect of fire during the breeding period means that breeding site choice is more likely determined by fire effects on seed nutritional value (Weier et al. 2017) than on the total number of available seeds. Early dry season fires will be most beneficial in terms of maximizing Sorghum spp. seed abundance and availability through the breeding and dry season. Lower frequency of early dry season fires was found to maximize nutritional content of Sorghum spp. seeds available to Gouldian finches (Weier et al. 2017) and likely influenced choice of breeding sites (Weier et al. 2016). Studies of breeding success in Gouldian finches also highlighted the influence of regional fire size and fire number in determining breeding success. More successful breeding occurred in years with multiple small fires than during years of a few large-scale fires (Weier et al. 2016). Greater breeding success with multiple small fires supports a <b>patch</b> “mosaic” <b>burning</b> approach to fire management of Gouldian finch breeding habitat, which is promoted by low fire intensity, early dry season burning. Such a regime would promote and maintain key resources for finches (e.g., food, cover, tree hollows) across savanna landscapes of northern Australia (Russell-Smith et al. 2013, Legge et al. 2015, Radford et al. 2015). Multiple small patchy early dry season fires will benefit Gouldian finches by increasing soil nutrient flushes resulting in increases in seed quality (Weier et al. 2017), as well as Sorghum spp. seed density and persistence. Patchy early dry season fires may also allow for greater development of mature, seeding perennial grasses as wet season seed resources for finches (Dostine et al. 2001). Previous studies have highlighted food shortages of perennial grass seeds under frequent fire regimes, especially during the late dry and the wet seasons (Dostine et al. 2001, Maute et al. 2013, Legge et al. 2015), although this is yet to be explicitly demonstrated. Future work into finch spatial movements and landscape resource use during putative food shortage periods will be necessary to fully unravel key ecological limitations for this tiny threatened grass finch.|$|R
