25|$|The Clinical <b>Pharmacogenetics</b> Implementation Consortium {{recommends}} avoiding amitriptyline {{in patients}} who are CYP2D6 ultrarapid or poor metabolizers, due to the risk {{for a lack of}} efficacy and side effects, respectively. The consortium also recommends considering an alternative drug not metabolized by CYP2C19 {{in patients who}} are CYP2C19 ultrarapid metabolizers. A reduction in starting dose is recommended for patients who are CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers and CYP2C19 poor metabolizers. If use of amitriptyline is warranted, therapeutic drug monitoring is recommended to guide dose adjustments. The Dutch <b>Pharmacogenetics</b> Working Group also recommends selecting an alternative drug or monitoring plasma concentrations of amitriptyline in patients who are CYP2D6 poor or ultrarapid metabolizers, and selecting an alternative drug or reducing initial dose in patients who are CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers.|$|E
25|$|A type of DNA variant {{known as}} a single {{nucleotide}} polymorphism (SNP) may help predict individuals prone to developing myopathy when taking simvastatin; a study ultimately including 32,000 patients concluded the carriers {{of one or two}} risk alleles of a particular SNP, rs4149056, were at a five-fold or 16-fold increased risk, respectively. In 2012, the Clinical <b>Pharmacogenetics</b> Implementation Consortium has released guidelines regarding the use of rs4149056 genotype in guiding dosing of simvastatin and updated the guideline in 2014.|$|E
25|$|Supported by a $3.2 million Department of Defense appropriation, the Penn State Center for <b>Pharmacogenetics</b> {{will create}} a {{repository}} of samples from patients treated at the Cancer Institute to study individual responses to therapeutic drugs and environmental toxins. Researchers will use the repository to identify specific gene variations, or molecular signatures, in cancer cells and use that knowledge to accelerate the identification of new molecular entities and ultimately develop more effective and personalized ways to prevent and treat cancer.|$|E
25|$|Current {{estimates}} {{state that}} 2 million hospital patients {{are affected by}} adverse drug reactions every year and adverse drug events are the fourth leading cause of death. These adverse drug reactions result in an estimated economic cost of $136 billion per year. Polymorphisms (genetic variations) in individuals effect drug metabolism and therefore an individual's response to a medication. Examples {{of ways in which}} genetics may affect an individual’s response to drugs include: drug transporters, metabolism and drug interactions. <b>Pharmacogenetics</b> may be used in the near future by public health practitioners to determine the best candidates for certain drugs, thereby reducing much of the guesswork in prescribing drugs. Such actions have the potential to improve the effectiveness of treatments and reduce adverse drug events.|$|E
25|$|The enzyme thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) is {{responsible}} for various activation and deactivation steps in azathioprine's mechanism of action. The first metabolic step that azathioprine undergoes in the body is the conversion to 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP; see Pharmacokinetics), which is itself an immunosuppressant prodrug. The TPMT enzyme {{is responsible}}, in part, for the methylation of 6-MP into the inactive metabolite 6-methylmercaptopurine - this methylation prevents 6-MP from further conversion into active, cytotoxic thioguanine nucleotide (TGN) metabolites. Certain genetic variations within the TPMT gene can lead to decreased or absent TPMT enzyme activity, and individuals who are homozygous or heterozygous for these types of genetic variations may have increased levels of TGN metabolites and {{an increased risk of}} severe bone marrow suppression (myelosuppression) when receiving azathioprine. In many ethnicities, TPMT polymorphisms that result in decreased or absent TPMT activity occur with a frequency of approximately 5%, meaning that about 0.25% of patients are homozygous for these variants. However, an assay of TPMT activity in red blood cells or a TPMT genetic test can identify patients with reduced TPMT activity, allowing for the adjustment of azathioprine dose or avoidance of the drug entirely. The FDA-approved drug label for azathioprine recommends testing for TPMT activity to identify patients at risk for myelotoxicity. Indeed, testing for TPMT activity is currently one of the few examples of <b>pharmacogenetics</b> being translated into routine clinical care. Missense SNP in NUDT15 (e.g., rs116855232, inducing R139C)) has been identified to be a causal factor for AZA-induced leukopenia through a genome wide association study (GWAS) in East Asians.|$|E
2500|$|Pharmacogenomics is {{the study}} {{of the role of the}} genome in drug response. Its name ( [...] + genomics) {{reflects}} its combining of pharmacology and genomics. Pharmacogenomics analyzes how the genetic makeup of an individual affects his/her response to drugs. It deals with the influence of acquired and inherited genetic variation on drug response in patients by correlating gene expression or single-nucleotide polymorphisms with pharmacokinetics (drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination) and pharmacodynamics (effects mediated through a drug's biological targets). The term pharmacogenomics is often used interchangeably with <b>pharmacogenetics.</b> Although both terms relate to drug response based on genetic influences, <b>pharmacogenetics</b> focuses on single drug-gene interactions, while pharmacogenomics encompasses a more genome-wide association approach, incorporating genomics and epigenetics while dealing with the effects of multiple genes on drug response.|$|E
2500|$|Examples {{of the use}} of {{personalized}} medicine include oncogenomics and pharmacogenomics. Oncogenomics is a field of study focused on the characterization of cancer–related genes. With cancer, specific information about a tumor is used to help create a personalized diagnosis and treatment plan. [...] Pharmacogenomics is the study of how a person's genome affects their response to drugs. This field is relatively new but growing fast due in part to an increase in funding for the NIH Pharmacogenomics Research Network. Since 2001, there has been an almost 550% {{increase in the number of}} research papers in PubMed related to the search terms pharmacogenomics and <b>pharmacogenetics.</b> This field allows researchers to better understand how genetic differences will influence the body's response to a drug and inform which medicine is most appropriate for the patient. These treatment plans will be able to prevent or at least minimize the adverse drug reactions which are a, [...] "significant cause of hospitalizations and deaths in the United States." [...] Overall, researchers believe pharmacogenomics will allow physicians to better tailor medicine to the needs of the individual patient. As of November 2016, the FDA has approved 204 drugs with <b>pharmacogenetics</b> information in its labeling. These labels may describe genotype-specific dosing instructions and risk for adverse events amongst other information.|$|E
2500|$|In cancer treatment, {{pharmacogenomics}} {{tests are}} used to identify which patients {{are most likely to}} respond to certain cancer drugs. In behavioral health, pharmacogenomic tests provide tools for physicians and care givers to better manage medication selection and side effect amelioration. Pharmacogenomics is also known as companion diagnostics, meaning tests being bundled with drugs. Examples include KRAS test with cetuximab and EGFR test with gefitinib. Beside efficacy, germline <b>pharmacogenetics</b> can help to identify patients likely to undergo severe toxicities when given cytotoxics [...] showing impaired detoxification in relation with genetic polymorphism, such as canonical 5-FU.|$|E
2500|$|The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) have {{provided}} new {{guidelines for the}} ethical issue of pediatrics genetic testing and screening {{of children in the}} United States. [...] Their guidelines state that performing pediatric genetic testing should be {{in the best interest of}} the child. In hypothetical situations for adults getting genetically tested 84-98% expressing interest in getting genetically tested for cancer predisposition. [...] Though only half who are at risk of would get tested. AAP and ACMG recommend holding off on genetic testing for late-onset conditions until adulthood. Unless diagnosing genetic disorders during childhood and start early intervention can reduce morbidity or mortality. They also state that with parents or guardians permission testing for asymptomatic children who are at risk of childhood onset conditions are ideal reasons for pediatrics genetic testing. Testing for <b>pharmacogenetics</b> and newborn screening is found to be acceptable by AAP and ACMG guidelines.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pharmacogenetics</b> is {{the study}} of {{inherited}} genetic differences in drug metabolic pathways which can affect individual responses to drugs, both in terms of therapeutic effect as well as adverse effects. The term <b>pharmacogenetics</b> is often used interchangeably with the term pharmacogenomics which also investigates the role of acquired and inherited genetic differences in relation to drug response and drug behaviour through a systematic examination of genes, gene products, and inter- and intra-individual variation in gene expression and function.|$|E
50|$|In oncology, <b>pharmacogenetics</b> {{historically}} is {{the study}} of germline mutations (e.g., single-nucleotide polymorphisms affecting genes coding for liver enzymes responsible for drug deposition and pharmacokinetics), whereas pharmacogenomics refers to somatic mutations in tumoral DNA leading to alteration in drug response (e.g., KRAS mutations in patients treated with anti-Her1 biologics). <b>Pharmacogenetics</b> is believed to account for inter-ethnic differences (e.g., between patients of Asian, Caucasian and African descent) in adverse events and efficacy profiles of many widely used drugs in cancer chemotherapy.|$|E

50|$|Although {{often used}} interchangeably, there are subtle {{differences}} between the two disciplines. <b>Pharmacogenetics</b> is generally regarded as the study or clinical testing of genetic variation that gives rise to differing responses to drugs, including adverse drug reactions. It is hoped that <b>pharmacogenetics</b> will eventually provide information as to which genetic profiles in patients will place those patients at greatest risk, or provide the greatest benefit, for using a particular drug or drugs. Pharmacogenomics, on the other hand, is the broader application of genomic technologies to new drug discovery and further characterization of older drugs.|$|E

5000|$|One {{concern that}} has risen is the ethical {{decision}} health providers must take {{with respect to}} educating the patient of {{the risks and benefits}} of medicine developed by this new technology. <b>Pharmacogenetics</b> is a new process that may increase the benefits of medicine while decreasing the risk. However clinicians have been unsuccessful in educating patients regarding the concept of benefits over risk. The Nuffield Council reported that patients and health professionals have adequate information about <b>pharmacogenetics</b> tests and medicine. Health care providers will also encounter an ethical decision in deciding to tell their patients that only certain individuals will benefit from the new medicine due to their genetic make-up. [...] Another ethical concern is that patients who have not taken the test be able to have access to this type of medicine. If access is given by the doctor the medicine could negatively impact the patient's health. The ethical issues behind <b>pharmacogenetics</b> tests, as well as medicine, are still a concern and policies will need to be implemented in the future.|$|E
