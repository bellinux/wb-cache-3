However, several crucial problems in its clinic usage and mechanisms are still unsolved or lack scientific evidences. In this research, C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were used to investigate hair growth promotion activity and possible mechanism of PMR and Polygonum multiflorum Radix Preparata (PMRP). Hair growth promotion activities were investigated by hair length, hair covered <b>skin</b> <b>ratio,</b> the number of follicles, and hair color. Regulation effects of several cytokines involved in the hair growth procedure were tested, such as fibroblast growth factor (FGF- 7), Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), β-catenin, insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1), and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Oral PMR groups had higher hair covered <b>skin</b> <b>ratio</b> (100 ± 0. 00 %) than oral PMRP groups (48 %~ 88 %).

The UFW content in all tissues increased rapidly in response to high CO 2 while it remained stable or decreased in untreated clusters.

The metabolic adjustment caused by exposure to high CO 2, which reduced the amount of water available to be frozen, improved stored fruit quality, thus minimising structural damage and reducing water leakage associated with the freezing-thawing process. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The mango rosa fruit is a very popular local variety (landrace), especially because of their superior technological characteristics such as high contents of Vitamin C and soluble solids (SS), as well as attractive taste and color.

The present study was designed to examine morphologically the existence of a lymph drainage system in human dental pulp. Human dental <b>pulp</b> and <b>skin</b> sections were immunohistochemically stained with specific antibodies for lymphatic endothelium (D 2 - 40, LYVE- 1, VEGFR- 3 [vascular endothelial growth factor receptor- 3], and Prox- 1), with the pan-endothelial markers CD 31 and von Willebrand factor (vWF), and with the blood-specific marker CD 34.

40|$|Grape {{polyphenols}} {{are characterized}} by a large range of structures diversely distributed {{in every part of}} the berry. The knowledge on the phenolic composition of grapes and its evolution during ripening is thus of crucial importance in relation to wine quality. Among them, anthocyanins, located in the skins, are responsible for the red colour of the grapes, while flavonoids and especially flavan- 3 -ols intervene in their taste, astringency and bitterness. In this study, total polyphenols, flavonoids, flavan- 3 -ols and anthocyanins were determined in the <b>pulp,</b> <b>skins</b> and seeds of Vranec grapes in three ripening stages: veraison, technological and physiological ripeness, applying standardized spectrophotometric methods [1, 2]. Extraction of phenolic compounds from grape <b>pulp,</b> seeds and <b>skins</b> was performed with acetone/water mixture (80 / 20, v/v). Results showed that the concentration of total phenolics in skins increased during ripening (21. 21 mg/g, 48. 17 mg/g, 61. 55 mg/g, {{at the beginning of the}} ripeness, at technological and physiological ripeness, respectively), but they slightly decreased in the seeds. Concentration of the total flavonoids in skins and seeds increased during the ripening process, as well as the anthocyanin content in skins, which was highest in the late harvested grapes. Flavan- 3 -ols in the seeds were present in highest concentration at the verasion phase, while in the skins their content increased during ripening reaching highest amount at the technological stage. Vranec grapes presented high content of phenolics, flavonoids, anthocyanins and flavan- 3 -ols, which are main antioxidant components in the wines.

Two experiments were carried out with the objective of determining the ripening behavior of 'Pedro Sato' guavas. In the first experiment, guava fruits at three maturity stages (I - dark green, II - light green and III - yellow-green) were stored at room temperature (23 ± 1 °C and 85 ± 5 % RH).
