25|$|The {{suggestion}} of Hugo Steinhaus {{is that the}} (central) triangle with sides p,q,r be reflected in its sides and vertices. These six extra triangles partially cover ABC, and leave six overhanging extra triangles lying outside ABC. Focusing on the parallelism of the full construction (offered by Martin Gardner through James Randi’s on-line magazine), the <b>pair-wise</b> congruencies of overhanging and missing pieces of ABC is evident. Thus six plus the original equals the whole triangle ABC.|$|E
25|$|Once {{quantitative}} {{counts of}} each transcript are available, differential gene expression {{is measured by}} normalising, modelling, and statistically analysing the data. Most read a table of genes and read counts as their input, but some, such as cuffdiff, will accept binary alignment map format read alignments as input. The final outputs of these analyses are gene lists with associated <b>pair-wise</b> tests for differential expression between treatments and the probability estimates of those differences.|$|E
25|$|The {{covalent}} <b>pair-wise</b> {{interaction between}} boronic acids and hydroxy groups {{as found in}} alcohols and acids is rapid and reversible in aqueous solutions. The equilibrium established between boronic acids and the hydroxyl groups present on saccharides has been successfully employed to develop a range of sensors for saccharides. One of the key advantages with this dynamic covalent strategy lies {{in the ability of}} boronic acids to overcome the challenge of binding neutral species in aqueous media. If arranged correctly, the introduction of a tertiary amine within these supramolecular systems will permit binding to occur at physiological pH and allow signalling mechanisms such as photoinduced electron transfer mediated fluorescence emission to report the binding event.|$|E
25|$|A 2004 {{study by}} Shen et al. {{compared}} the Y-DNA and DNA-mt Samaritans of 12 men {{with those of}} 158 men who were not Samaritans, divided between 6 Jewish populations (Ashkenazi origin, Moroccan, Libyan, Ethiopian, Iraqi and Yemeni) and 2 non-Jewish populations from Israel (Druze and Arab). The study concludes that significant similarities exist between paternal lines of Jews and Samaritans, but the maternal lines differ between the two populations. The <b>pair-wise</b> genetic distances (Fst) between 11 populations from AMOVA applied to the Y-chromosomal and mitochondrial data. For the Y-chromosome, all Jewish groups (except for the Ethiopian Jews) {{are closely related to}} each other and do not differ significantly from the Samaritans (0.041) or Druze (0.033), but are different from Palestinian Arabs (0.163), Africans (0.219), and Europeans (0.111). This study indicated that the Samaritan and Jewish Y-chromosomes have a much greater affinity for the other than for their geographical neighbors, the Palestinian Arabs. This suggests the two share a common ancestral Near Eastern population preceding their divergence in the 4th century BCE, supporting the Samaritan narrative of descent from native Israelites who survived the Assyrian exile rather than from foreign populations introduced by the Assyrian Empire. However, the mtDNA results did not match other Jewish populations at all, supporting the Jewish narrative of the Assyrians displacing the population of the northern Israelite Kingdom. From these results the researchers concluded that the Samaritans are descended from Hebrew men and non-Hebrew women, confirming elements of both the Jewish and Samaritan narratives.|$|E

Fst (Fixation index) was found to correlate considerably with geographic distances ranging from ≤0.0010 for neighbouring populations to 0.0200–0.0230 for Southern Italy and Finland. For comparisons, <b>pair-wise</b> Fst of non-European samples were as follows: Europeans – Africans (Yoruba) 0.1530; Europeans – Chinese 0.1100; Africans (Yoruba) – Chinese 0.1900.|$|E
2500|$|Choosing a Cartesian {{coordinate}} {{system for a}} three-dimensional space means choosing an ordered triplet of lines (axes) that are <b>pair-wise</b> perpendicular, have a single unit of length for all three axes and have an orientation for each axis. [...] As in the two-dimensional case, each axis becomes a number line. [...] The coordinates of a point P are obtained by drawing a line through P perpendicular to each coordinate axis, and reading the points where these lines meet the axes as three numbers of these number lines.|$|E
2500|$|During a {{classical}} MD simulation, the most CPU intensive task is {{the evaluation of}} the potential {{as a function of the}} particles' internal coordinates. Within that energy evaluation, the most expensive one is the non-bonded or non-covalent part. In Big O notation, common molecular dynamics simulations scale by [...] if all <b>pair-wise</b> electrostatic and van der Waals interactions must be accounted for explicitly. This computational cost can be reduced by employing electrostatics methods such as particle mesh Ewald summation ( [...] ), particle–particle-particle–mesh (P3M), or good spherical cutoff methods ( [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|Gene {{networks}} {{can also}} be constructed without formulating an explicit causal model. This {{is often the case}} when assembling networks from large expression data sets. Covariation and correlation of expression is computed across a large sample of cases and measurements (often transcriptome or proteome data). The source of variation can be either experimental or natural (observational). There are several ways to construct gene expression networks, but one common approach is to compute a matrix of all <b>pair-wise</b> correlations of expression across conditions, time points, or individuals and convert the matrix (after thresholding at some cut-off value) into a graphical representation in which nodes represent genes, transcripts, or proteins and edges connecting these nodes represent the strength of association (see [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|The second question, [...] "how is operant {{behavior}} controlled?" [...] arises because, {{to begin}} with, the behavior is [...] "emitted" [...] {{without reference to}} any particular stimulus. [...] Skinner answered this question by saying that a stimulus comes to control an operant if it is present when the response is reinforced and absent when it is not. [...] For example, if lever-pressing only brings food when a light is on, a rat, or a child, will learn to press the lever only when the light is on. Skinner summarized this relationship by saying that a discriminative stimulus (e.g. light) sets the occasion for the reinforcement (food) of the operant (lever-press). This [...] "three-term contingency" [...] (stimulus-response-reinforcer) is one of Skinner's most important concepts, and sets his theory apart from theories that use only <b>pair-wise</b> associations.|$|E
50|$|Isomap is a {{combination}} of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm with classic Multidimensional Scaling. Classic Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) takes a matrix of <b>pair-wise</b> distances between all points, and computes a position for each point. Isomap assumes that the <b>pair-wise</b> distances are only known between neighboring points, and uses the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to compute the <b>pair-wise</b> distances between all other points. This effectively estimates the full matrix of <b>pair-wise</b> geodesic distances between all of the points. Isomap then uses classic MDS to compute the reduced-dimensional positions of all the points.|$|E
