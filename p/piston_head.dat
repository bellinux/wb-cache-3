25|$|The SG 550 is a selective-fire 5.56×45mm NATO {{assault rifle}} firing from a closed bolt. It has a gas-actuated piston-driven {{long-stroke}} operating system {{derived from the}} SIG SG 540 series of rifles, which uses burnt powder gases vented through a port in the barrel to power the weapon's moving parts. Once inside the gas cylinder, propellant gases pass through an L-shaped channel machined in the <b>piston</b> <b>head</b> and are directed forward towards the gas valve. The pressure build-up {{in front of the}} <b>piston</b> <b>head</b> pushes the piston and bolt carrier rearward. As the piston is driven back, the gas port and the L-shaped channel move out of alignment, cutting off the supply of gas to the cylinder. Surplus gas and powder residues are evacuated through an exhaust port in the gas cylinder. This system ensures that only the precise volume of gas required to overcome the mass and resistance of the rifle's moving assembly is admitted from the barrel. The manually adjustable gas valve has two settings, one for normal operation, and the second setting for use in the presence of heavy fouling or icing.|$|E
2500|$|A trunk engine {{locates the}} {{connecting}} rod within a large-diameter hollow piston rod. [...] This [...] "trunk" [...] carries almost no load. [...] The {{interior of the}} trunk is open to outside air, and is wide enough to accommodate the side-to-side motion of the connecting rod, which links a gudgeon pin at the <b>piston</b> <b>head</b> to an outside crankshaft.|$|E
2500|$|When fired, {{a portion}} of the {{propellant}} gases are evacuated into the gas cylinder through a [...] port, drilled at a 30° angle in the barrel, and a channel in the gas block. The high-pressure gases drive the piston rod (which is attached to the bolt carrier) rearward. During this rearward movement, a cam slot machined into the bolt carrier engages a cam pin on the bolt and rotates the bolt, unlocking the action. The arrangement of parts on the bolt carrier assembly provides for a degree of free travel, allowing gas pressure in the barrel to drop to a safe level before unlocking. To the immediate rear of the chrome-plated <b>piston</b> <b>head</b> is a notched ring which provides a reduced bearing surface and alleviates excess gas build-up. As the bolt carrier travels back, it compresses the return spring guided in a hollowed section of the bolt carrier and the return energy contained in the spring drives the moving assembly back forward, stripping a new round from the magazine and locking the action. The cocking handle is attached to the bolt carrier {{on the right side of}} the receiver and reciprocates with each shot; the handle is bent upwards allowing for operation with the left hand while the shooting hand remains on the pistol grip.|$|E

50|$|If a circlip (or any non {{preloaded}} system) is used, {{the force}} acting {{to separate the}} <b>Piston</b> <b>Head</b> and the Cylinder Shaft shoulder is the applied pressure multiplied by {{the area of the}} <b>Piston</b> <b>Head.</b> The <b>Piston</b> <b>Head</b> and Shaft shoulder will separate and the load is fully reacted by the <b>Piston</b> <b>Head</b> Retainer.|$|E
50|$|If a {{preloaded}} {{system is}} used the force between the Cylinder Shaft and <b>Piston</b> <b>Head</b> is initially the <b>Piston</b> <b>Head</b> Retainer preload value. Once pressure is applied this force will reduce. The <b>Piston</b> <b>Head</b> and Cylinder Shaft shoulder {{will remain in}} contact unless the applied pressure multiplied by <b>Piston</b> <b>Head</b> area exceeds the preload.|$|E
50|$|The maximum {{force the}} <b>Piston</b> <b>Head</b> Retainer will {{see is the}} larger of the preload and the applied {{pressure}} multiplied by the full <b>Piston</b> <b>Head</b> area. It {{is interesting to note that}} the load on the <b>Piston</b> <b>Head</b> Retainer is greater than the external load, which is due to the reduced shaft size passing through the <b>Piston</b> <b>Head.</b> Increasing this portion of shaft reduces the load on the Retainer.|$|E

50|$|A seal must be {{made between}} the sliding piston and {{the walls of the}} {{cylinder}} so that the high pressure gas above the piston does not leak past it and reduce the efficiency of the engine. This seal is usually provided by one or more piston rings. These are rings made of a hard metal, and are sprung into a circular groove in the <b>piston</b> <b>head.</b> The rings fit tightly in the groove and press against the cylinder wall to form a seal.|$|E
50|$|Side loading is unequal {{pressure}} {{that is not}} centered on the cylinder rod. This off-center strain can lead to bending of the rod in extreme cases, but more commonly causes leaking due to warping the circular seals into an oval shape. It can also damage and enlarge the bore hole around the rod and the inner cylinder wall around the <b>piston</b> <b>head,</b> if the rod is pressed hard enough sideways to fully compress and deform the seals to make metal-on-metal scraping contact.|$|E
50|$|The {{classical}} apparatus uses rough {{end plates}} - the whole {{surface of the}} <b>piston</b> <b>head</b> {{is made up of}} rough, porous filter. In upgraded apparatuses the tough end plates are replaced with smooth, polished glass, with a small filter at the center. This configuration allows a specimen to slide / expand horizontally while sliding along the polished glass. Thus, the contact zone between sample and the end plates does not buildup unnecessary shear friction, and a linear / isotropic stress field within the specimen is sustained.|$|E

50|$|The FNC's barrel {{features}} a flash suppressor {{that is also}} used to launch NATO standard 22mm rifle grenades (only the standard rifle model has this capability). The gas block contains a gas valve setting that is used to isolate the gas system, providing an increased volume of propellant required to fire a rifle grenade. The sheet-metal gas valve switch when pulled upright, acts as a V-notch sight used for aiming the rifle grenades. The <b>piston</b> <b>head</b> and extension, as well as the gas port block, barrel bore and chamber, are hard-chrome plated to minimize the effects of propellant fouling.|$|E
50|$|Gas-{{operation}} is {{a system}} of operation used to provide energy to operate autoloading firearms. In gas operation, a portion of high-pressure gas from the cartridge being fired is used to power a mechanism to extract the spent case and insert a new cartridge into the chamber. Energy from the gas is harnessed through either a port in the barrel or a trap at the muzzle. This high-pressure gas impinges on a surface such as a <b>piston</b> <b>head</b> to provide motion for unlocking of the action, extraction of the spent case, ejection, cocking of the hammer or striker, chambering of a fresh cartridge, and locking of the action.|$|E
