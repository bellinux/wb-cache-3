40|$|<b>Pressure</b> <b>casting</b> is a forming method {{which has}} been known for a long time. This forming {{technique}} has been accepted more and more in the sanitary ware production over the last fifteen years due its clearly higher productivity as compared with plaster mould slip casting. However the application of <b>pressure</b> <b>casting</b> in the field of non-clay ceramics is very limited and under development. A laboratory <b>pressure</b> <b>casting</b> machine was used for casting of aqueous silicon nitride slips. Several commercial polymethylmethacrylate materials were applied as the filtering and moulding material. The penetration of fine powder particles into the mould was avoided by partially flocculation of the slips. With the partially flocculated slips lower green densities were reached (maximum 54 per cent) compared with <b>pressure</b> <b>cast</b> deflocculated slips (maximum 63 per cent). In both cases the slip pressure was varied in the range 1 MPa - 3 MPa and it did not significantly influenced the green density. The bending strength of the sintered samples was between 700 and 800 MPa and it is consequently lower than the strength of dry pressed samples. Large pores because of a inhomogeneous distribution of the polyacrylate binder were detected as defects in the microstructure.

40|$|Das keramische Druckgussverfahren wird in der Sanitärindustrie erst seit den 1980 er Jahren {{verwendet}} und ist somit ein noch relativ junges Verfahren mit viel Optimierungspotential. Insbesondere der Füllvorgang einer Druckgussform wurde bis heute nur wenig untersucht. Die Optimierung des Füllvorgangs kann geometrischer Art sein (Design des Produktes, Eingussposition und Entlüftungsposition) oder durch die Anpassung der Prozessparameter (Formmaterial, Druck, Füllgeschwindigkeit und Temperatur) und der rheologischen Eigenschaften der keramischen Gießmasse (Viskositat, Thixotropie und Litergewicht) erfolgen. Diese Vielfalt an Parametern zur Steuerung des Druckgussprozesses sowie die Tatsache, dass experimentelle Messungen in einer Druckgussform während des Füllvorgangs so gut wie unmöglich sind, machen den Einsatz einer Computersimulation notwendig. Dies zu ermöglichen ist das Ziel dieser Arbeit. Zunächst wird ein phänomenologisches Materialmodell präsentiert, das sich zur Beschreibung des thixotropen Verhaltens von Alumosilikatsuspensionen eignet. Anschließend wird das Materialmodell in die Strömungssimulationssoftware FLOW 3 D implementiert und anhand von einfachen zweidimensionalen Geometrien sowie an einer produktionserprobten, komplexen dreidimensionalen Geometrie validiert. Das Ergebnis dieser Arbeit trägt zum besseren Verständnis des Füllvorgangs einer Druckgussform bei und stellt der Sanitärindustrie, in Kombination mit der vorhandenen praktischen Erfahrung, ein sehr wirksames Werkzeug zur Optimierung des Druckgussprozesses zur Verfügung. The <b>pressure</b> <b>casting</b> {{process has}} been introduced in the sanitary ware industry since the 1980 s and is therefore still a young technology with a high potential of optimization. Especially the filling of a <b>pressure</b> <b>casting</b> mould has been analysed poorly until today. The filling of a sanitary mould is controlled through many different parameters like geometry parameters (product design, inlet position, inlet diameter, etc), process parameters (mould material, pressure in the mould, inlet velocity, temperature, etc) and material properties of ceramic slurry (viscosity, thixotropy, density, etc). The correct setting of the above listed parameters is extremely difficult, due to their influence on the filling {{which can not be}} measured directly. To better understand which influence the different parameters have on the filling of a <b>pressure</b> <b>casting</b> mould as well as to rapidly solve problems in the production, it appears necessary to use the computational fluid dynamics. This is the main objective of this thesis. In a first step a macroscopic material model, able to describe the thixotropic behaviour of ceramic slurry, will be developed. Then the material model will be implemented in the commercial computational fluid dynamics software FLOW 3 D. Computer simulation of 2 D-geometries and 3 D-geometries will be used to validate the material model and the move of the slurry surface during the filling of a <b>pressure</b> <b>casting</b> mould. The results of this thesis illustrate that the computer simulation of the filling of a sanitary mould, with a thixotropic slurry, help to better comprehend the filling process of <b>pressure</b> <b>casting</b> in the sanitary industry. In combination with the industrial practical experience about <b>pressure</b> <b>casting,</b> the computer simulation will be a very efficient tool to rapidly master casting production challenges...|$|R
