5|$|The {{official}} mission countdown {{began on}} Monday, April 10, 1972, at 8:30 AM, six {{days before the}} launch. At this point the Saturn V rocket's three stages were powered up and drinking water was <b>pumped</b> into the spacecraft. As the countdown began, the crew of Apollo 16 was participating in final training exercises {{in anticipation of a}} launch on April 16. The astronauts underwent their final preflight physical examination on April 11. On April 15, liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants were <b>pumped</b> into the spacecraft, while the astronauts rested in anticipation of their launch the next day.|$|E

5|$|A spur {{was built}} near Rhosgoch to {{facilitate}} the building of an oil tank farm in the 1970s. This was built to receive oil from tankers moored offshore in the deep waters off Amlwch, before it was <b>pumped</b> to the Stanlow Refinery in Cheshire. The site was decommissioned after a short life, but the short spur remains.|$|E
5|$|Capillaries are {{organized}} into capillary beds in tissues; {{it is here}} that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste. In the capillary beds blood flow is slowed to allow maximum diffusion of oxygen into the tissues. Once the blood has become deoxygenated it travels through venules then veins and back to the heart. Veins, unlike arteries, are thin and rigid as they do not need to withstand extreme pressure. As blood travels through the venules to the veins a funneling occurs called vasodilation bringing blood back to the heart. Once the blood reaches the heart it moves first into the right atrium, then the right ventricle to be <b>pumped</b> through the lungs for further gas exchange of carbon dioxide waste for oxygen. Oxygenated blood then flows from the lungs through the left atrium to the left ventricle where it is <b>pumped</b> out to the body.|$|E
30|$|Deep <b>pumping</b> with small-diameter <b>pump</b> {{means to}} use small-diameter <b>pump</b> {{in place of}} bigger-diameter <b>pump</b> to deepen the <b>pump.</b> Small-diameter <b>pump</b> has a {{relatively}} smaller cross-sectional area, so the liquid pressure load can be reduced.|$|R
50|$|In a {{hydraulic}} installation, one <b>pump</b> can serve several cylinders and motors. However, {{in that case}} a constant pressure system is required and the system always needs full power. It is more economic to give each cylinder and motor its own <b>pump.</b> In that case, multi-pump assemblies can be used. Gear <b>pumps</b> are often supplied as multi-pumps. The different chambers (sometimes of different sizes) are mounted in one body or built together. Vane <b>pumps</b> and gerotor <b>pumps</b> too are often available as multi-pumps. Screw <b>pumps</b> can be combined with gear or vane <b>pumps.</b> Axial piston swashplate <b>pumps</b> can be combined with a second <b>pump,</b> or {{with one or more}} gear <b>pumps</b> or vane <b>pumps</b> (the gear or vane <b>pumps</b> often serving as flush <b>pumps</b> for cooling larger units). Axial plunger <b>pumps</b> of the bent-axis design cannot be combined with other <b>pumps.</b>|$|R
50|$|Most {{centrifugal}} <b>pumps</b> are not self-priming. In other words, the <b>pump</b> casing must {{be filled}} with liquid before the <b>pump</b> is started, or the <b>pump</b> {{will not be able}} to function. If the <b>pump</b> casing becomes filled with vapors or gases, the <b>pump</b> impeller becomes gas-bound and incapable of <b>pumping.</b> To ensure that a centrifugal <b>pump</b> remains primed and does not become gas-bound, most centrifugal <b>pumps</b> are located below the level of the source from which the <b>pump</b> is to take its suction. The same effect can be gained by supplying liquid to the <b>pump</b> suction under pressure supplied by another <b>pump</b> placed in the suction line.|$|R
5|$|Coal was {{the almost}} {{exclusive}} {{fuel for the}} pre-dreadnought period, though navies made the first experiments with oil propulsion in the late 1890s. An extra knot or two of speed could be gained by applying a 'forced draught' to the furnaces, where air was <b>pumped</b> into the furnaces, but this risked damage to the boilers.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, Erie started {{building}} a waterworks on Presque Isle to provide fresh {{water for the}} city. Water from Lake Erie was <b>pumped</b> into two reservoirs on the peninsula, where particulates in the water were allowed to settle, removing them from the lake water. After treatment, the water flowed into the waterlines of the city. In 1917 a pumphouse powered by a steam boiler and engine was built: this <b>pumped</b> the water from one basin into the other, then across Presque Isle Bay to Erie. This system of supplying drinking water for Erie operated until 1949. The pumphouse is now used for zebra mussel control and as a concession stand for bicycle and quadracycle-rentals within the state park.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve the <b>pump</b> {{efficiency}} of <b>pumping</b> wells, {{by means of the}} basic formula of <b>pump</b> efficiency, the mathematical model and boundary conditions of dynamic control chart is obtained, and the <b>pump</b> efficiency of <b>pumping</b> wells is drawn. Analysis shown that the <b>pump</b> efficiency is sensitive to the water content and <b>pump</b> leak rate. The higher the water content is, the higher <b>pump</b> efficiency is. The <b>pump</b> efficiency will be reduced with the increasing of <b>pump</b> leak rate. The dynamic control chart of class II block of A oilfield is given in the paper. After taking the measures, the <b>pump</b> efficiency of <b>pumping</b> wells is obviously improved. The dynamic control chart drawn by this method can provide a scientific basis for improving the <b>pump</b> efficiency of <b>pumping</b> wells in oilfield...|$|R
30|$|There {{were about}} 150 solar <b>pumps</b> in Bangladesh among them 65 Â % solar <b>pumps</b> {{were used for}} {{supplying}} drinking water to the poor people of the locality and about 35 Â % solar <b>pumps</b> were used for irrigation purposes. Panel cost was the major cost (45 Â %) in solar <b>pump</b> followed by installation cost (18 Â %), motor cost (16 Â %), <b>pump</b> cost (10 Â %), and pipes and fitting cost (4 Â %). Considering the operating cost, diesel engine-operated <b>pump</b> is profitable {{for the period of}} less than 5 years. For the period of 5 years or more, solar <b>pump</b> becomes more profitable than diesel engine-operated <b>pump</b> of same capacity. The benefit cost ratio of solar <b>pump</b> (1.91) was found higher than diesel-operated <b>pump</b> (1.31). Net present value of solar <b>pump</b> was higher than diesel engine-operated <b>pump</b> which indicates that investing on solar <b>pump</b> is more profitable than diesel <b>pump.</b> Internal rate of return of solar <b>pump</b> (80 Â %) was found higher than diesel engine-operated irrigation <b>pump</b> (71 Â %). Numbers of irrigation <b>pumps</b> and carbon dioxide emissions from irrigation <b>pumps</b> over the years are increasing. Diesel engine-operated irrigation <b>pump</b> emits carbon dioxide and pollutes environment, but solar <b>pump</b> is an environment-friendly irrigation technology.|$|R
50|$|A bilge <b>pump</b> is a water <b>pump</b> used {{to remove}} bilge water. Since fuel can {{be present in}} the bilge, {{electric}} bilge <b>pumps</b> are designed to not cause sparks. Electric bilge <b>pumps</b> are often fitted with float switches which turn on the <b>pump</b> when the bilge fills to a set level. Since bilge <b>pumps</b> can fail, use of a backup <b>pump</b> is often advised. The primary <b>pump</b> is normally located at the lowest point of the bilge, while the secondary <b>pump</b> would be located somewhat higher. This ensures that the secondary <b>pump</b> activates only when the primary <b>pump</b> is overwhelmed or fails, and keeps the secondary <b>pump</b> free of the debris in the bilge that tends to clog the primary <b>pump.</b>|$|R
5|$|In total, 36% of all {{materials}} and labour costs were spent in Wales, with approximately 1,000tonnes (157,500 stone) of Welsh slate used. The environmental {{features of the}} building have allowed energy savings of between 30% and 50% compared to buildings without these features. The features include 27 pipes that were drilled 100m below ground, so that during cold spells, water is <b>pumped</b> through the pipes and heated to 14Â°C by geothermal energy. The hot water is then <b>pumped</b> {{back up to the}} slate floor to warm the building to a constant temperature. In warm spells, the same system helps to keep the building cool. A biomass boiler was installed to use wood chips from recycled waste wood to heat the building, and rainwater is collected from the roof to flush the toilets in the building.|$|E
5|$|It is {{estimated}} {{that as much as}} another 1.2 GW of capacity remains available to exploit, mostly in the form of micro and small-hydro developments such as the existing one in Knoydart and a system planned for Kingussie. In reality, environmental constraints and given that the most easily available catchment areas have already been exploited {{it is unlikely that the}} full 1.2 GW will exploited. The 100 MW Glendoe Project which opened in 2009 was the first large scale dam in Scotland for almost fifty years but is likely to be one of the last of its kind. There is also further potential for new <b>pumped</b> storage schemes (at present used to meet peak demand) that would work with intermittent sources of power such as wind and wave. Examples include the 440 MW Cruachan Dam and 300 MW Falls of Foyers schemes. A 2011 report calculated that <b>pumped</b> storage hydro capacity could supply 2.8 GW of electricity for 5 hours, then drop to 1.1 GW and run out of water in 22 hours. The report concluded that even with projected new schemes at Loch Ness and Loch Sloy, <b>pumped</b> storage would not be able to replace wind electricity during extended windless periods.|$|E

50|$|The {{two main}} types of {{molecular}} <b>pumps</b> are the diffusion <b>pump</b> and the turbomolecular <b>pump.</b> Both types of <b>pumps</b> blow out gas molecules that diffuse into the <b>pump</b> by imparting momentum {{to the gas}} molecules. Diffusion <b>pumps</b> blow out gas molecules with jets of oil or mercury, while turbomolecular <b>pumps</b> use high speed fans to push the gas. Both of these <b>pumps</b> will stall and fail to <b>pump</b> if exhausted directly to atmospheric pressure, so they must be exhausted to a lower grade vacuum created by a mechanical <b>pump.</b>|$|R
5|$|Originally {{fed by the}} River Westbourne and Tyburn Brook in the 1730s, the lake's {{water was}} then <b>pumped</b> from the Thames in the 1830s.

5|$|Pumped-storage {{hydroelectricity}} stores {{energy in}} the form of water <b>pumped</b> when energy is available from a lower elevation reservoir to a higher elevation one.

5|$|The heart pumps blood with {{a rhythm}} {{determined}} {{by a group of}} pacemaking cells in the sinoatrial node. These generate a current that causes contraction of the heart, traveling through the atrioventricular node and along the conduction system of the heart. The heart receives blood low in oxygen from the systemic circulation, which enters the right atrium from the superior and inferior venae cavae and passes to the right ventricle. From here it is <b>pumped</b> into the pulmonary circulation, through the lungs where it receives oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide. Oxygenated blood then returns to the left atrium, passes through the left ventricle and is <b>pumped</b> out through the aorta to the systemic circulationâwhere the oxygen is used and metabolized to carbon dioxide. The heart beats at a resting rate close to 72 beats per minute. Exercise temporarily increases the rate, but lowers resting heart rate in the long term, and is good for heart health.|$|E
