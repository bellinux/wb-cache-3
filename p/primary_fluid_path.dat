This single-piston model comprehensively considers fluid compressibility, orifice restriction effect, fluid resistance in the capillary tube, and the leakage flow. Besides, the instantaneous discharge areas used in the single-piston model have been calculated in detail. Based on the single-piston model, a multi-piston pump model has been established according to the simple hydraulic circuit. The single- and multi-piston pump models have been realized by the S-function in Matlab/Simulink. The developed multi-piston pump model has been validated by being compared with the numerical result by computational fluid dynamic (CFD).

40|$|The {{concept of}} fluid-to-fluid direct {{interaction}} whereby energy {{can be transferred}} among the interacting fluids was demonstrated and shown to be conceivable in non-steady ejectors. Unlike steady ejectors, the mechanism responsible for the energy transfer is reversible and thus higher efficiencies are expected. Of interest is to investigate the effects of Mach numbers {{on the performance of}} non-steady ejectors with radial-flow diffusers. The radial-flow ejectors usually lead to higher-pressure ratios with fewer stages. The Mach number of the <b>primary</b> <b>fluid</b> flow emerging out of the free-spinning rotor is considered an important factor among various parameters that affects the process of energy transfer. Specifically, the flow field is investigated at two Mach numbers 2. 5 and 3. 0 utilizing rectangular short-length supersonic nozzles for accelerating the <b>primary</b> <b>fluid.</b> Also the effects of increasing the total pressure of the <b>primary</b> <b>fluid</b> on the flow field are investigated. The results are compared with earlier investigation at Mach number 2. 0, which showed significant enhancement in energy transfer with increase in Mach number. Fundamental to the enhancement of these devices performance relies on the management of the flow field in such a way to minimize entropy production.

Necessary and sufficient conditions for positive recurrence are easy to formulate for d = 2, but not for d > 2.
