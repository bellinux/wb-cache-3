However, most existing hybrid precoding schemes are based on singular value decomposition (SVD). Due to the very different sub-channel signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) after SVD, complicated bit allocations is usually required to match the sub-channel SNRs. To solve this problem, we propose a geometric mean decomposition (GMD) -based hybrid precoding scheme to avoid the complicated bit allocation. Its basic idea is to seek a pair of analog and digital <b>precoding</b> <b>matrices</b> that are sufficiently close to the optimal unconstrained GMD <b>precoding</b> <b>matrix.</b> Specifically, we design the analog (digital) <b>precoding</b> <b>matrix</b> while keeping the digital (analog) <b>precoding</b> <b>matrix</b> fixed.

30|$|To {{adapt the}} {{transmission}} parameters {{to the current}} channel conditions, CSI at the transmitter is required. Since up- and downlink are implemented for frequency-division duplexing mode, the reciprocity of the channel cannot be exploited. For non-reciprocal channels, the receiver has to estimate the channel and then feed back the CSI to the transmitter. To reduce the overhead, the fed back CSI is quantized. The feedback calculation is an intelligent way of quantizing the CSI, it comprises the <b>precoding</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>indicator</b> (PMI), rank indicator (RI) and channel quality indicator (CQI).

Furthermore, in a realistic system, the CSI feedback is reported for a given TTI but used for a later downlink transmission.

30|$|More {{sophisticated}} adaptive techniques apply varying antenna weight vectors to the transmit antennas {{depending on}} the radio channel state information. Information about the radio channel state is obtained by explicit feedback from the user equipment to the base station, e.g. in LTE transmission mode TM 4 [13], denoted as closed-loop MIMO transmission. In this case, the UE measures the channel state from known cell-specific reference signals (CRS) on the downlink and determines the best suited transmit antenna weight vector {{to be used by}} the base station on the DL. In order to limit the necessary overhead for such feedback, the transmit weights can only be selected from a standardised codebook containing a limited set of precoding matrices, each containing the weight vectors for the parallel transmission layers. The UE feedback can thereby be limited to the rank indicator (RI) defining the number of possible parallel transmission layers and the <b>precoding</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>indicator</b> (PMI) pointing to the best suited precoding matrix in the codebook. The codebook size is a critical system design parameter, a trade-off between feedback information overhead and MIMO capability.|$|E

That is, the <b>precoding</b> <b>matrix</b> by ZFBF or BD eliminates not only the undesired interference signal, but also the intended signal, and the reduction of the desired signal is roughly proportional to the distance between its own channel and the <b>precoding</b> <b>matrix.</b> For example, if the channels among the selected users are orthogonal to each other, the desired signal does not suffer degradation because the <b>precoding</b> <b>matrix</b> is aligned with the channel of the desired signal perfectly.

One or more layers can be mapped to the same codeword and are jointly encoded for transmission to the same target UE. The RI is estimated at the UE as a wideband measure, that is, the same channel rank is assumed on all allocated resources. The CQI is an index in the modulation coding scheme (MCS) and transport block size (TBS) index table (32 different entries). The PMI is an index in the codebooks defined for a given number or transmit antenna ports (1, 2, 4 in LTE and up to 8 for LTE Advanced). The CQI information is always derived under the assumption that the selected PMI will be applied to the next scheduled transmission.

30|$|In the CBF scheme, {{data are}} only {{available}} at a serving cell; however, for the channel-state information (CSI) scheme, the sharing levels {{can be defined}} as follows: full CSI sharing, partial CSI sharing, and no CSI sharing [23]. With full CSI sharing, the problem can be formulated as an optimization problem for beamforming weight vector calculations among the coordinated cells [24 – 26]. With partial CSI sharing, when inter-base-station communication is limited, the interfering BTS can perform nulling to cancel the ICI and can conduct user selection and beamformer design in a cooperative fashion to select users with the worst parallel interfering channels to the victim to decrease the ICI caused by all streams [23, 27]. For the no CSI sharing scenario, approaches have been proposed to maximize the ratio between the signal strength of served users and the interference caused to other users; this is called the signal-leakage-plus-noise ratio (SLNR) [28, 29]. Here, a lightweight CBF approach is <b>precoding</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>indicator</b> (PMI) coordination, in which each UE transmits either “restriction PMI” or “recommendation PMI” to its serving cell. Then, the neighboring eNB can either use the recommended PMI or avoid the restricted PMI through coordination among the eNBs [30].|$|E
