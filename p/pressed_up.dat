5|$|The French Resistance in Paris rose {{against the}} Germans on 19 August. Eisenhower {{initially}} wanted {{to bypass the}} city to pursue other targets, but amid reports that the citizens were going hungry and Hitler's stated intention to destroy it, de Gaulle insisted {{that it should be}} taken immediately. French forces of the 2nd Armoured Division under General Philippe Leclerc arrived from the west on 24 August, while the U.S. 4th Infantry Division <b>pressed</b> <b>up</b> from the south. Scattered fighting continued throughout the night, and by the morning of 25 August Paris was liberated.|$|E
5|$|Yankovic {{desired to}} release the song on a record label, {{although}} no label wanted to sign him at the time. Thus, Yankovic borrowed some money from Dr. Demento and <b>pressed</b> <b>up</b> one thousand copies of the four-track EP by himself. Yankovic then distributed the EP to various record stores, selling them through consignment deals. Yankovic released the record under Placebo Records, a one-off label founded by Yankovic {{for the sole purpose}} of distributing the EPs. Due to the underground success of the record, Yankovic was eventually able to secure a short-lived record deal with TK Records, who released the title song as a single. Due to the fact that only one thousand copies of the Another One Rides the Bus EP were made, today it is considered a very rare record to locate.|$|E
5|$|French successes continued. With Charles {{absent from}} the north, Jourdan recrossed the Rhine and drove Wartensleben behind the Lahn. Pushing forward again, the Army of Sambre and Meuse {{defeated}} its opponents in the Battle of Friedberg (also called the First Battle of Limburg) on 10 July, while Charles was busy at Ettlingen. In this action, the Austrians suffered 1,000 casualties against a French loss of 700. Jourdan captured Frankfurt am Main on 16 July. Leaving behind François Séverin Marceau-Desgraviers with 28,000 troops to blockade Mainz and Ehrenbreitstein, Jourdan <b>pressed</b> <b>up</b> the Main River. Following Carnot's strategy, the French commander continually operated against Wartensleben's north flank, causing the Austrian general to fall back. Jourdan's army numbered 46,197 men while Wartensleben counted 36,284 troops; Wartensleben felt no security in attacking the larger French force. Buoyed up by their forward movement and by the capture of Austrian supplies, the French captured Würzburg on 4 August. Three days later, the Army of Sambre and Meuse, under the temporary direction of Kléber, won another clash with Wartensleben at Forchheim on 7 August.|$|E

40|$|A {{pilot study}} {{investigating}} {{the influence of}} vibration during <b>press</b> <b>ups</b> on myoelectrical activity of both dynamic and stabiliser muscles. Nine male participants (21. 1 ± 3. 4 years, 1. 68 ± 0. 03 m, 72. 3 ± 9. 5 kg), performed <b>press</b> <b>ups</b> under 3 conditions: without vibration, low amplitude and frequency vibration (30 L; 1. 2 mm, 30 Hz) high amplitude and frequency vibration (40 H; 1. 9 mm, 40 Hz). <b>Press</b> <b>ups</b> were completed in a randomised order {{for a period of}} 15 s with 3 min rest. 3 D motion capture with synchronous surface electromyography (EMG) of dynamic muscles (triceps, pectoralis major) and stabiliser muscles (serratus anterior, lower trapezius muscles). The introduction of vibration to <b>press</b> <b>ups</b> did not result in kinematic changes to exercises. No muscles analysed displayed significant increases in mean EMG amplitude in response to 30 L VIB in the eccentric or the concentric phase of the exercise. 40 H Vibration significantly increased EMG amplitudes of all muscles (p < 0. 05) except the lower trapezius. Greater increases were observed during the concentric phase of movement. These results indicate that vibration influences muscle activity during <b>press</b> <b>up</b> exercises. However, further studies are required including additional information such as the transmission of vibration to the neck and head, should be completed...|$|R
25|$|The 1st Battalion, Hertfordshire Regiment mobilised on the {{outbreak}} of war, as part of 162nd Infantry Brigade, attached to 54th (East Anglian) Infantry Division on coastal defence in October 1939. It remained employed on such duties until March 1943, when it was ordered to prepare for overseas service. It arrived in Gibraltar on 22 April, {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Colonel G. W. H. Peters MC. It remained there for over a year, much of the time spent training, before being deployed to Italy in July 1944 where it joined 66th Infantry Brigade and became part of the 1st Infantry Division. It moved into the frontline on 19 August, relieving 6/13th Frontier Force Rifles northeast of Florence. On the 31 August the battalion advanced on Fiesole, clearing the village of the enemy by midnight. On 2 September it was relieved and moved up the main axis of the advance north of the city, codenamed ‘Arrow Route’, against an enemy withdrawing to the Gothic Line positions. On 14 September the battalion played a part in securing the first break into the Gothic Line. Following artillery preparation and smoke, two companies outflanked the German outpost line and <b>pressed</b> <b>up</b> the Poggio Prefetto, seizing the summit and holding it until relieved. Meanwhile, on their left, American troops made a similar advance.|$|E
500|$|The {{tunneling}} {{resulted in}} [...] of earthwork, {{most of which}} {{was used for the}} expansion of the Port of Drammen. It was transported away from the tunnel with up to 12 truckloads per hour. The first breakthrough took place on 5 June 2008. On 19 October 2008, there was a ground failure at a storage area of earthwork. This caused a land slip which <b>pressed</b> <b>up</b> earthwork nearby at Gjønnes Station on the Kolsås Line of the Oslo Metro; a [...] long section of one platform and track was <b>pressed</b> <b>up</b> , resulting in the other track lying on its side. Because of changes to European Union regulations after planning of the project, three extra emergency staircases had to be installed in late 2009. The final breakthrough in the tunnel occurred on 26 July 2009. The tunneling took place under the groundwater level. To avoid similar problems which occurred during the construction of the Romerike Tunnel, where massive leaks took a year to fix, several test bores were made in the area to measure the groundwater level. Any indications of a change would immediately be automatically communicated to the on-site geologists, who would be able to act accordingly. The system also automatically pumped water into the affected areas to compensate for any leaks until they could be fixed.|$|E

500|$|Mikey MiGo of 411mania {{wrote that}} the song is a [...] "welcomed change" [...] from Timberlake's past work. She stated that the song [...] "has qualities of Prince that I've never seen anyone muster up before". Amanda Murray of Sputnikmusic called the song [...] "musically and melodically great", but criticized its lyrics. She {{wrote that the}} lyrics sound like the {{dialogue}} of a [...] "low-rent porn film", highlighting the lines: [...] "She's <b>pressed</b> <b>up</b> on me; I think she's ready to blow?" [...] and [...] "All I need is a moment alone, to give you my tongue and {{get you out of}} control". According to Murray, [...] "It makes one question exactly what films Timberlake was starring in during his sabbatical." [...] She concluded that [...] "FutureSex/LoveSound" [...] establishes a pattern for the rest of FutureSex/LoveSounds: [...] "infectiously catchy and in many cases accomplished pop music, marred by retardedly retarded lyrics".|$|E
500|$|Along with {{introducing}} the band's new sound, the song opens the album as {{a statement of}} intent. Lyrically, new anticipations and appetites are suggested ("I'm ready for what's next"), as is a willingness to throw caution to the wind and take risks ("I'm ready {{to let go of}} the steering wheel"). Some of the lyrics, particularly those in the bridge before the final chorus, use the eponymous subway station as a metaphor for time: [...] "Time is a train / Makes the future the past / Leaves you standing in the station / Your face <b>pressed</b> <b>up</b> against the glass". Bono cites the enjoyment of his first child born in 1989 as a major influence on Achtung Baby, as was his wife's second pregnancy during the album's 1991 recording. Bono says babies influenced the lines from the first verse, [...] "I'm ready to say I'm glad to be alive / I'm ready, I'm ready for the push".|$|E
500|$|The Byrds {{returned}} to the recording studio with Melcher sporadically between October 1970 and early March 1971, in order to complete the follow-up to (Untitled), which would be released in June 1971 as Byrdmaniax. [...] Unfortunately, the grueling pace of the band's touring schedule at the time meant {{that they were not}} fully prepared for the sessions and as a result, much of the material they recorded was under-developed. [...] Following completion of the album recording sessions, the Byrds once again headed out on tour, leaving Melcher and engineer Chris Hinshaw to finish mixing the album in their absence. [...] Controversially, Melcher and Hinshaw elected to bring in arranger Paul Polena to assist in the overdubbing of strings, horns, and a gospel choir onto many of the songs, allegedly without the band's consent. [...] Drummer Gene Parsons recalled in a 1997 interview that when the band heard Melcher's additions they campaigned to have the album remixed and the orchestration removed but Columbia Records refused, citing budget restrictions, and the record was duly <b>pressed</b> <b>up</b> and released.|$|E

2500|$|Due to {{the lack}} of a {{sufficient}} budget, only a few hundred copies of The College Kicked-Out were initially <b>pressed</b> <b>up.</b> [...] The record was available only on compact disc and the original copies—complete with liner notes that featured both sample information and phony album credits (for example, sample clearance services are credited to a Hugh Jazfynes, a pun on hip-hop artists having to pay [...] "huge-ass fines" [...] should they get sued for failure to clear samples)—are very rare and are now considered collector's items.

2500|$|Following the {{completion}} of recording sessions for the album in early March 1971, The Byrds headed out on tour again, leaving Terry Melcher and engineer Chris Hinshaw to finish mixing the album.

2500|$|The album's innominate title {{actually}} came about by accident. According to Jim Bickhart's liner {{notes on the}} original double album sleeve, the group's intention was to name the release something more grandiose, such as Phoenix or The Byrds' First Album. These working titles were intended to signify the artistic rebirth that the band felt the album represented. Another proposed title for the album was McGuinn, White, Parsons and Battin but McGuinn felt that this title might be misinterpreted by the public. The band still had not {{made up their minds}} regarding a title when Melcher, while filling out record company documentation for the album sessions, wrote the placeholder [...] "(Untitled)" [...] in a box specifying the album's title. A misunderstanding ensued and before anyone associated with the band had realized, Columbia Records had <b>pressed</b> <b>up</b> the album with that title, including the parentheses.|$|E
