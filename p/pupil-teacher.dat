Nevertheless, William and Ann did their best to ensure that their children were educated and prepared for life. Margaret was a clever child, whose skills at reciting poetry or playing piano pieces were often displayed at town events and Sunday School outings. Until the age of 13 she attended the local elementary school; she then worked for a year as a <b>pupil-teacher</b> (she was paid three shillings a week) in the school's boys' department. Local employment opportunities being scarce, she left Chard in 1887, at the age of 14, to begin an apprenticeship at a draper's shop in Hove, near Brighton.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to assess and compare the attitude towards creative teaching of B. Ed. <b>Pupil-teachers</b> belonging to science and art streams. A sample of 200 B. Ed. pupil- teachers was drawn by using stratified random sampling technique from 5 colleges of Sambhal district. Attitude towards creative teaching was assessed by employing Attitude Scale of Creative Teaching developed by Dr. R. P. Shukla (1). The study revealed that B. Ed. <b>Pupil-teachers</b> of science stream have more positive attitude towards creative teaching than their counterparts of arts stream where as the female pupil teachers also have positive attitude than the male pupil teachers...|$|R

25|$|Francia {{abolished}} {{higher education}} {{on the grounds that}} it was the nation's financial priority to fund the army, and that private study could be freely conducted in his library. Francia closed the country's only religious seminary in 1822, mainly due to the bishop's mental illness (and from his purge of the power of the Church). Nevertheless, he made state education compulsory for all males in 1828, but he neither helped nor hindered the private schools. Even after this, the <b>pupil-teacher</b> ratio grew and there were less illiterate, with one teacher to 36 pupils by 1825 according to Richard Alan White. In 1836, Francia opened Paraguay's first public library, stocked with books confiscated from his opponents. Books were one of the few duty-free items (munitions being another).|$|E

After five years there, {{he worked as a}} <b>pupil-teacher</b> for a year before spending two years at the Teachers' College.

That was deferred for a year, enabling him to graduate M.A., also from UWA, and to marry fellow teacher Mary Alice ('Lallie') Ross at the end of 1931. As a student at UWA, Coombs was elected as the 1930 Sports Council president and subsequently the 1931 president of the Guild of Undergraduates.

In its initial development, the NVC model re-structured the <b>pupil-teacher</b> relationship to give students greater responsibility for, and decision-making related to, their own learning. The model has evolved over the years to incorporate institutional power relationships (i.e., police-citizen, boss-employee) and informal ones (i.e. man-woman, rich-poor, adult-youth, parent-child).

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} the study was to explore {{expectations}} and experiences of <b>pupil-teachers</b> during their teaching practice session. The paper examines how the theoretical coursework of pupil teachers support them and hamper them during their teaching practice. What are the practical considerations that they need to keep in mind and what issues they face. For this purpose a sample of 35 <b>pupil-teachers</b> of M. A. Early childhood Education program was randomly selected. An observation schedule was prepared to observe them during their teacher practice. An interview protocol was also designed to get their views on theoretical and practical aspects of their teaching experiences. Collected data were analyzed qualitatively with content analysis technique to get deeper understanding of the problem. Results showed that there was a mismatch between theoretical coursework and practical teaching work. The pupil-teachers’ expectations were very high and they had passion to work but they experienced non-professional attitude of cooperating teachers. Data also showed that the pupil teachers’ training during course-work was professionally weak, particularly in the areas of interactive teaching methods, classroom management, evaluation techniques and educational psychology. It suggests more focus on practical side of training rather than theoretical. It was suggested that there might be more practical and activity oriented material and training sessions during their coursework along with proper supervision and guidance...|$|R

[...] Many assert that most boys would be happy to have a teacher show sexual interest in them.

2500|$|UCSD Economics {{professor}} Julian Betts states: “What {{all this}} means for spending is that starting around 1978-1979 {{we saw a}} sharp reduction in spending on schools. We fell compared to other states dramatically, and we still haven’t really caught up to other states.” [...] From 1977, in California {{there has been a}} steady growth of class sizes compared to the national average, “which have been decreasing since 1970.” [...] The shortage in funds translated to decreased spending per student in the years following passage of Proposition 13. During the 1970s, school spending per student was almost equal to the national average. Using discount rate, “measured in 1997-1998 dollars, California spent about $100 more per capita on its public schools in 1969-1970 than did the rest of the country." [...] Since 1981-1982, California consistently has spent less per student {{than the rest of the}} U.S. as demonstrated by data collected by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and by the Public Policy Institute of California [...] This has resulted in increased pupil-to-teacher ratios in K-12 public schools in California. Professor Betts observes that “pupil-teacher ratios start to skyrocket in the years immediately after 1978, and a huge gap opens up between <b>pupil-teacher</b> ratios here and in the rest of the country, and we still haven’t recovered from that." ...|$|E
