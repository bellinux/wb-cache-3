5|$|Agonistic {{behaviour}} typically {{consists of}} squabbles between individuals climbing over or passing each other. This occasionally involves biting. Males that are strangers may wrestle, chase, and bite each other. In extreme situations, a male {{may try to}} displace a smaller rival from a tree. This involves the larger aggressor climbing up and attempting to corner the victim, which tries either to rush <b>past</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> climb down or {{to move to the}} end of a branch. The aggressor attacks by grasping the target by the shoulders and repeatedly biting him. Once the weaker individual is driven away, the victor bellows and marks the tree. Pregnant and lactating females are particularly aggressive and attack individuals that come too close. In general, however, koalas tend to avoid energy-wasting aggressive behaviour.|$|E
5|$|At {{the foot}} of the climb, the leading group only had a small {{advantage}} over the peloton and were soon caught. There were no lead-out trains in the final kilometres, with fewer than 60 riders left in the group. Tosh Van der Sande (Lotto-Soudal) was the first to sprint, but Kristian Sbaragli (MTN-Qhubeka) came <b>past</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> took the stage victory. Degenkolb was the quickest in the final metres, but he had been badly positioned and was only able to finish second. José Joaquín Rojas (Movistar) finished third. The stage was Sbaragli's first win in over two years. It was the second win of his career and the first in a Grand Tour.|$|E
5|$|As soon as Gibraltar was captured, the Alliance {{set about}} {{preparing}} for a Bourbon counter-attack. The Alliance fleet sailed a short distance across the strait to Tetuan in Morocco, where it took on fresh water. On 22 August, a French fleet was sighted in the strait but began to withdraw after being spotted. Rooke {{caught up with the}} French off Málaga on 24 August and attacked, in a bid to prevent the French from slipping <b>past</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> attacking Gibraltar. The two fleets were evenly matched but the French ships were faster and had more ammunition than the confederates. They did not manage to make this advantage count, however, and the Battle of Vélez-Málaga was effectively fought to a draw. No ships were sunk but both fleets took very heavy casualties with around 3,000 killed or wounded on each side, including the French commander. The Anglo-Dutch fleet was hampered by a shortage of shot and gunpowder, much of which had already been used in bombarding Gibraltar during the operation to capture it, and Sir George Byng's squadron was forced to pull back when it ran out of ammunition. The rest of the fleet was dangerously low on ammunition but fortunately for the confederates, the French withdrew the following day, leaving the Anglo-Dutch fleet to limp back to Gibraltar.|$|E

25|$|Bryant {{was near}} the exit, {{preventing}} others from attempting to run <b>past</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> escape. Bryant moved across the café towards the gift shop area. There was an exit door through the display area to the outside balcony, but it was locked and could only be opened with a key. As Bryant moved, Robert Elliott stood up. He {{was shot in the}} arm and head, left slumping against the fireplace but alive.|$|E
25|$|For the 1962–63 season, Rovers {{abandoned}} their now familiar {{blue and white}} quarters in favour of blue pinstripes. Also in this season, the club signed goalkeeper Esmond Million from Middlesbrough for £5,000. In April 1963, The People newspaper ran a story alleging that Million had accepted a bribe to lose the match against Bradford (Park Avenue) on 20 April. During the game he had allowed a backpass to slip <b>past</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> allowed a cross to go, enabling Bradford to score twice. Unfortunately for Million, Rovers also scored twice so the game ended 2–2 and Million did not receive the money he had been offered to lose the game. Million and his accomplice, Keith Williams, were fined £50 each by Doncaster Magistrates' Court, and banned from football for life by The FA.|$|E
25|$|At about 10:30p.m., Powell {{was escorted}} to the Seward {{residence}} on Lafayette Square near the White House by David Herold. Seward {{had been injured}} in a carriage accident on April 5, and suffered a concussion, broken jaw, broken right arm, and many serious bruises. Local newspapers reported that Seward was at home convalescing, so Powell and Herold knew where to find him. Powell was armed with a Whitney revolver and large knife, and wore black pants, a long overcoat, a grey vest, a grey dress coat, and a hat with a wide brim. Herold waited outside, holding Powell's horse. Powell knocked and rang the bell, and the door was answered by William Bell, Seward's African American butler. Holding up a small bottle, Powell claimed that Seward's physician, Dr. T.S. Verdi, had sent some medicine to the house. Bell was suspicious, as Dr. Verdi had departed the home only an hour earlier and left instructions for Seward not to be disturbed. Bell asked Powell to wait, but Powell pushed <b>past</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> began mounting {{the stairs to the}} second-floor bedrooms.|$|E

500|$|Soon after half-time, Hawley Edwards, Francis Heron and Jarvis Kenrick {{combined}} in a skilful attack {{and set up}} Hughes to score his second goal of the game. [...] Although the Wanderers' goalkeeper, W. D. O. Greig, was called into action several times, the Etonians were unable {{to get the ball}} <b>past</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> the match finished 30 to the Wanderers. [...] The winning team's captain Francis Birley was praised for his performance by the press, as were both Lyttleton brothers for the Etonians.|$|E
500|$|Stannard {{attacked}} with [...] remaining. He had a [...] advantage, but {{the group}} was {{able to come back}} to him. In the final , Boonen attacked several times. On the last of these attacks, Hayman accelerated <b>past</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> the two riders came together into the velodrome, with Vanmarcke joining soon afterwards. With one [...] lap remaining, Stannard and Boasson Hagen rejoined the group. Hayman led out the sprint: Boonen was on his wheel and Stannard came around the outside. Neither was able to come around him and Hayman crossed the line first to take the victory. Boonen was second with Stannard third. Vanmarcke finished with them in fourth place; Boasson Hagen was three seconds behind in fifth place.|$|E
500|$|During {{discussion}} of the track listing in Lights and Sounds, Yellowcard revealed that [...] "Two Weeks from Twenty" [...] stretched the [...] "limits" [...] for them and explained {{that it was a}} [...] "jazz-lounge anti-war song". The band also explained that the song is a narrative of a young soldier named Jimmy, from New Jersey, who is killed in the Iraq war. Other songs such as [...] "Down on My Head", [...] "City of Devils", and [...] "Holly Wood Died", had a theme that spoke about bitterness and disillusionment. [...] "How I Go" [...] is based on both lament of a father over the life that has flowed <b>past</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> the 2003 film, Big Fish. Another song, [...] "Words, Hands, Hearts", is written about the events that occurred during the September 11 attacks.|$|E

500|$|Jurgen Van den Broeck of , [...] rider Alejandro Valverde, and 's Robert Gesink {{encountered}} difficulties at this point, {{and would}} lose over a minute {{by the end}} of the day. Sørensen and 's Michael Albasini were the last of the leaders to be caught, with just over [...] remaining. [...] continued to break the peloton apart, and by the time the leaders had reached the flamme rouge, only five riders remained at the front – Wiggins and his teammate Chris Froome, 's Cadel Evans, [...] rider Vincenzo Nibali and Rein Taaramäe of [...] – for the closing kilometre. Evans hit the final corner first, but Froome looked strongest on the steepest part of the climb, and he eventually went <b>past</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> Wiggins, accelerating away to a two-second time gap over his rivals. With 's Fabian Cancellara losing almost two minutes on the day, he surrendered the yellow jersey to Wiggins, who became the fifth British rider to wear the jersey, and first since David Millar in 2000. Froome assumed the polka-dot jersey thanks to the stage victory, while Taaramäe took the white jersey from Evans' teammate Tejay van Garderen.|$|E
500|$|There {{were several}} reasons the tournament went so badly for El Salvador. First of all, El Salvador took 20 players to the World Cup, leaving behind Gilberto Quinteros and Miguel González. According to Luis Guevara Mora, goalkeeper {{of the team}} by that time, the Salvadoran Football Federation decided to take members of the Federation, {{as well as the}} friends and family of many members of the Federation, and spent so much money they couldn't afford to bring a full 22-man squad. Some fellow players tried to gather money to pay to bring their {{teammates}} but couldn't get enough. Further heightening controversy, the team took many detours and stops throughout Europe {{under the direction of the}} Federation, taking 3 days to arrive in Spain and were the last team to do so. Once arrived, there was more trouble. Adidas sent four white and three blue uniforms for each player, but mysteriously only three white and one blue arrived. The remaining uniforms were said to have been taken away by the association. They decided to play with the white uniform and keep the blue as a keepsake. Next, someone stole the balls that the team would train with. The day prior to the match against Hungary, the Hungarians had the 25 balls the organization had given them and trained with them while El Salvador had none and was unable to train. To make things even worse, El Salvador had never seen Hungary play. The only knowledge that they had about the team was a lone outdated video that they had bought. On the field there were more problems. Hungary's fourth goal was caused by Francisco Jovel's sudden deafness. Jovel had received a heavy blow on the cheek and almost could not hear. So when Guevara Mora cried off to stop a ball, the defender did not hear him. Mora attempted to pass to Jovel, but Jovel wasn't looking and the ball went <b>past</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> went straight in front of the net. The Hungarian player only had to tap it in. After the match, the Salvadoran squad had a tense meeting with the coaching staff and Federation. The coach was dismissed immediately and the following matches against Belgium and Argentina were managed by players Jovel, Huezo and Fagoaga. Although the tournament overall was a big disappointment, there were also several bright spots. Jorge [...] "Mágico" [...] González was considered by the national and international press as the best player. [...] "Mágico" [...] González stayed in Spain after the tournament and played for Cádiz CF and Real Valladolid. Ricardo Guevara Mora, the goalkeeper, was the youngest player to play at the 1982 FIFA World Cup at 20 years old.|$|E
2500|$|On December 2, 1995, in his 19th game (and the team's 23rd) of the 1995–96 season, Roy was in net {{against the}} Detroit Red Wings during Montreal's worst home game in {{franchise}} history, an 11–1 loss. Roy allowed nine goals on 26 shots, which was highly unusual, as star goalies are generally {{taken out of}} the game quickly on off-nights. During the second period, the crowd provided mock applause after Roy made an easy save, prompting him to sarcastically raise his arms in mock celebration. When Mario Tremblay pulled Roy {{in the middle of the}} second period in favour of Pat Jablonski, Roy stormed <b>past</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> told Canadiens President Ronald Corey, who was sitting behind the bench, [...] "It's my last game in Montreal."

2500|$|Contador {{said that}} he did not know that Schleck had {{technical}} trouble, and that he had already launched an attack by then, but review of the race shows that he was chasing an attack by Schleck, that he nearly struck Schleck as he moved <b>past</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> that he looked back repeatedly on the climb while Schleck struggled to close down the gap. [...] Hours later, he apologised for the incident. Although he was criticised by Sean Kelly and a number of riders both past and current, he also found support from the likes of Bernard Hinault, Miguel Indurain, Eddy Merckx and Laurent Jalabert. [...] Cervélo team owner Gerard Vroomen commented: [...] "Contador just gained a great chance to win, but he lost the chance to win greatly." [...] This same stage saw Anthony Charteau take the lead in the King of the Mountains competition from fellow Frenchman Jérôme Pineau.|$|E
2500|$|When {{interviewed by}} police, Taylor {{eventually}} admitted kidnapping Tiernan. His explanation {{was that he}} had not visited Haughley Gill for many years, but by chance had been there on the afternoon that Tiernan went missing. He said that she had walked <b>past</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> on impulse he had seized her from behind, tied her hands behind her back with a dog leash, covered her head with his jacket and forced her to walk to his home in nearby Cockshott Drive. He then forced her into his bedroom and onto the bed where, during a struggle, she had fallen off the bed, striking her head on the floor. He said that he had then picked her up by the scarf around her neck, at which point she had died, and claimed that her death was an accident. He said he had panicked and hidden her body in Lindley Woods.|$|E
2500|$|In the Record of the [...] "Nagasaki A-bomb War Disaster", {{those close}} to the hypocenter (Matsuyama township), were {{described}} as all having been killed, {{with the exception of}} [...] "a child who was in an air-raid shelter." [...] A little further away, Professor Seiki of Nagasaki Medical School Hospital was building an air-raid dugout 400 m from the hypocenter of the detonation and survived. Chimoto-san, who was atop a distant hill that creates the valley in which Nagasaki is situated, performed the similar [...] "hit the deck" [...] maneuver upon seeing the bomb drop, which was notably prior to the detonation. However despite having these few seconds of relatively unique warning, he did not stay on the ground for long enough after the flash subsided, and received some translational injuries due to prematurely standing-up again, at which point the slower moving blast wave swept <b>past</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> carried him with it for a few meters.|$|E

2500|$|After {{a quarter}} of the stage, Chacón held a maximum lead of almost 12 minutes over the rest of the field, but [...] started to lift the pace in the peloton in the long bid to bring back Chacón. With added help from the team-mates of Rodríguez, the peloton had reduced Chacón's {{advantage}} to around four-and-a-half minutes at the midpoint of the stage. He was ultimately brought back to the main field with just under [...] of the stage remaining. The final lap of the circuit saw many of the sprint trains head towards the front of the group; under the flamme rouge, it was [...] – for Daniele Bennati – and Gianni Meersman's [...] outfit, that were at the head of proceedings with [...] close behind. Bennati launched his sprint first, but with help from team-mate Simon Geschke, John Degenkolb followed Bennati for a time before sprinting <b>past</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> won his second stage of the race by around half a bike length. Meersman completed the top three of the stage results, as Rodríguez maintained his overall lead.|$|E
2500|$|North of Tarragona lay Monte Olivo which {{overlooked}} the lower town. Atop the feature, the Spanish defenders built the powerful Fort Olivo, {{protected by a}} ditch carved into solid rock and defended by 1,000 soldiers. Suchet and his engineers determined to start the Siege of Tarragona from the west side, but first they needed to capture Fort Olivo from which the Spanish could take the siege trenches under a crossfire. Suchet arranged his divisions with Habert on the right at the coast, Frère in the center straddling the Francolí and Harispe on the left. In Harispe's division Salme's French brigade faced Fort Olivo while the two Italian brigades reached around to touch the coast east of Tarragona. Harispe's division included three battalions each of the 7th and 16th Line Infantry Regiments and eight Italian battalions. On 13 May the French captured two small fortifications in front of Fort Olivo and beat back a three-battalion counterattack by the Spanish the next day. Because the main attack from the west was delayed, Suchet decided to concentrate a vigorous effort against Fort Olivo beginning on 23 May. Over {{the next few days}} batteries before the fort were armed with 13 cannons which began to inflict serious damage on it. On the night of 27 May, as French soldiers dragged four 24-pound cannons into battery, they were blasted by Spanish fire which caused numerous casualties. At this moment, the defenders mounted a sortie from Fort Olivo. Watching the proceedings carefully, Salme called out to his reserves, [...] "Brave 7th forward!" [...] He was struck in the head by a musket ball and killed instantly. The men rushed <b>past</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> repulsed the Spanish attack. Fort Olivo fell {{on the night of the}} 29th with heavy losses to the defenders.|$|E
