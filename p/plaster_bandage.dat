40|$|The {{classical}} <b>plaster</b> <b>bandage</b> was devised {{in the mid}} 19 th century. Until recently, osteoarticular trauma {{has been}} treated mostly by plaster cast immobilisation using plaster of Paris. Synthetic materials have been introduced on the market place in the seventies, {{but they have not}} superseded the traditional plaster of Paris. The more recent thermoplastic materials are used to make splints and orthoses, particularly at the wrist and hand. The present review of the literature confirms that synthetic materials present better physical and mechanical properties than the traditional plaster of Paris. In addition, they are lighter, they are more resistant to humidity, they are more radiotransparent and they generate less dust when removed. However, they are less malleable and cause higher pressure in case of limb edema. Plaster of Paris therefore remains indicated in the acute posttraumatic or postoperative period. This material is also cheaper, but the pecuniary benefit is limited for several reasons, particularly because plaster of Paris is associated with a higher rate of cast replacement.

40|$|A {{prosthetist}} makes {{a conventional}} socket by wrapping <b>plaster</b> <b>bandage</b> around {{the residual limb}} and using the resulting shell to create a positive model. After he or she modifies the plaster, {{it is used to}} create a laminated socket. Such sockets are almost perfect cylinders that encapsulate the limb. The bone is centered in soft, compressible tissue that must move aside before the bone can push against the socket to transmit force or torque to the prosthesis. In a compression/release stabilized (CRS) socket, three or more longitudinal depressions compress and displace tissue between the socket wall and the bone to reduce lost motion when the bone is moved with respect to the socket. Release areas between depressions are opened to accommodate displaced tissue. Without these openings provided, the CRS socket will not function as intended. Often, the release areas of compression are the struts of a carbon-fiber frame, and the regions between struts are left open. A frame with openings may be modified by the prosthetist adding a thin membrane fully surrounding the limb but allowing the membrane and underlying tissue to enter the release openings. The membrane may contain electrodes, and it may constitute a roll-on liner that helps suspend the prosthesis. We introduce three socket designs: transradial, transfemoral, and transhumeral...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{study the}} {{expression}} changes of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in traumatic {{deep vein thrombosis}} (TDVT) in a rat model {{with the aid of}} gene chip technology and to explore the roles of MMPs in TDVT. MethodsTotally 150 Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into control group (n= 10) and model group (n= 140). Rat models of TDVT were established by clamping the femoral vein and fixing the bilateral hind limbs. Then fixation of the hip spica with <b>plaster</b> <b>bandage</b> was conducted. According to the observation phases and/or biological situations of the femoral vein thrombosis, the model rats were further divided into 7 groups. Vascular tissues were obtained from each group through noninvasive incision into the femoral vein at corresponding time points. We adopted the Trizol one-step method for total RNA extraction, Affymetrix RAT 230 2. 0 array for detection of RNA expressions and fold change (FC) analysis for changes of differential expressions of MMPs in each group. The main outcome parameters measured included expressions of MMP- 2, MMP- 3, MMP- 7, MMP- 8, MMP- 9, MMP- 10, MMP- 11, MMP- 12, MMP- 13, MMP- 14, MMP- 16, MMP- 23 and MMP- 24. Gene array data of these MMPs were analyzed by the Affymetrix Microarray Analysis software (Version 5. 0). ResultsFC analysis showed differential expressions of MMPs in each group during the course of TDVT. At the initial period of thrombosis, MMP- 2, MMP- 3, MMP- 7, MMP- 8, MMP- 9, MMP- 10, MMP- 11, and MMP- 24 had significantly high expression, while MMP- 12, MMP- 13, MMP- 14, MMP- 16 and MMP- 23 had relatively low expression. MMPs were all highly expressed at the peak time of thrombosis. In the process of thrombus resolution, MMP- 2, MMP- 10, MMP- 16 and MMP- 24 have relatively low expression, while MMP- 12, MMP- 13, MMP- 14, MMP- 16 and MMP- 23 have significantly high expression. ConclusionMMPs may affect the process of TDVT through transcription regulation of the fibrinolysis-anti-fibrinolytic system during the course of thrombosis and thrombus resolution...|$|E
40|$|Congenital {{false joint}} of shin occurs in 1 case per 28 000 - 190 000 live births, {{but it is}} hard-to-treat and {{disabling}} disease. Objective: Improving treatment outcomes, {{reducing the number of}} surgical interventions for the treatment of congenital false joint of shin. Materials and Methods. The method is carried out using staged plaster casts with the gradual correction of deformities. When axis of the leg approximates to the normal one, axial load is added. First, it is done by tapping on the heel. When the child was 7 - 8 months old he was put on the legs and taught to walk. The <b>plaster</b> <b>bandage</b> is replaced by "Scotch cast" and "soft cast" bandage. The treatment lasted up to reaching of clinical effect â€“ correction of shin deformation and absence of pathological mobility. Clinical effect must be confirmed by roentgenography which must demonstrate filling of false joint zone with bone tissue and restoration of intramedullary canal. During all the period of treating alternate courses of electrophoresis with calcium chloride, medical mud extracts and magnetic therapy are conducted. In the period from 1995 till 2015 in the Regional Zaporizhzhia Children Clinical Hospital 4 children (6 shins) aged from 1 to 7 months with false joint of shin were treated using proposed method. Results and discussion. All 4 children (6 shins) treated in clinic with proposed conservative method showed filling of false joint zone with bone tissue, restoration of intramedullary canal and significant extension of axis of the shin. The load on the leg in early terms results in compression of bone fragments (as in compression-distraction osteosynthesis), magnetic therapy, electrophoresis with calcium chloride and medical mud extracts promote active functioning of the muscles that improves regional blood supply and improves osteogenesis. Conclusions. Using the proposed method of treatment of congenital false joint of shins in newborns and infants can allow avoiding surgical intervention and disability of the child. The problem of congenital shin false joint treatment in children is not fully settled and needs further study and solution. ...|$|E

DESIGN [...] Part of larger randomised trial of five different dressings. SETTING [...] Outpatient venous ulcer clinic in university hospital. PATIENTS [...] (a) Pressure exerted by both bandage systems was measured in the same 20 patients. (b) Healing with the four layer bandage was assessed in 148 legs in 126 consecutive patients (mean age 71 (SE 2); range 30 - 96) with chronic venous ulcers that had resisted treatment with traditional bandaging for a mean of 27. 2 (SE 8) months. INTERVENTIONS [...] (a) Four layer bandage system or traditional adhesive <b>plaster</b> <b>bandaging</b> for pressure studies; (b) four layer bandaging applied weekly for studies of healing. END POINTS [...] (a) Comparison of pressures achieved at the ankle for up to one week; (b) complete healing within 12 weeks. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS [...] (a) Four layer bandage produced higher initial pressures at the ankle of 42. 5 (SE 1) mm Hg compared with 29. 8 (1. 8) for the adhesive plaster (p less than 0. 001; 95 % confidence interval 18. 5 to 6. 9). Pressure was maintained for one week with the four layer bandage but fell to 10. 4 (3. 5) mm Hg at 24 hours with adhesive <b>plaster</b> <b>bandaging.</b> (b) After weekly bandaging with the four layer bandage 110 of 48 venous ulcers had healed completely within 12 (mean 6. 3 (0. 4)) weeks. CONCLUSION [...] Sustained compression of over 40 mm Hg achieved with a multilayer bandage results in rapid healing of chronic venous ulcers that have failed to heal in many months of compression at lower pressures with more conventional bandages...|$|R

We meet with varied opinions of the therapy which has connections with the injury status of the Achilles tendon. The task of this work is to find out the effect of two different physical therapy plans on the physical condition of patients. It follows the existence of differences in the total therapeutic length. It deals with the question of the application of the unit therapeutic plan for all the patients with the Achilles tendon injury. The synthesis of observations of Achilles tendon problems is the first aim of this work. The theoretical part of this work focuses on the synthesis of observations of Achilles tendon problems as well. The work defines different Achilles tendon injuries. The Achilles tendon rupture is described in detail. The pieces of knowledge about anatomy, investigation, diagnostic processes and possibilities of treatment which are mainly from physical therapy point of view are summarized. Complications, prognosis and prevention are mentioned in this work. The other aim of this work is to draw two different therapeutic plans of the homogeneous complex of two probands. The practical part of the work focuses on making varied therapeutic plans of the homogeneous complex of two probands since the time of removing the <b>plaster</b> <b>bandage.</b> The methodology of the qualitative research with techniques of the anamnestic conversation, observation and application of therapeutic plans withing the frame of two cases history one of which is total with the submission of physical therapy methods, concepts and physiatrics is mentioned and used. The other therapeutic plan misses physiatrics because not every rehabilitative places of work have the possibility to use the combined therapy. The results were evaluated by comparing of two output kinesiology analyses of the homogeneous complex of two probands. Both used therapeutic plans have positive effect in reference to motivation to a patient to another therapy, improving quantity of motion of ankle joint and increasing of muscular force. It is not possible to make the unified therapeutic plan for every patients with the Achilles tendon injury. It is necessary to follow the individualization which continues the detailed input checkup.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} varying numbers of layers of <b>plaster</b> of Paris <b>bandages</b> on the mechanical properties of specimens used {{on the construction of}} orthopedic splints. METHODS: Rectangular plate-shaped and cylinder-shaped specimens were constructed and assigned to two groups simulating plaster slabs and cast and further divided into six subgroups according to the number of layers used: 3, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 layers. The specimens were subjected to either a three-point bending test (plates/slab) or compressive strength test (cylinders/cast). The following mechanical properties were evaluated: maximum load, elastic limit load and stiffness. Specimen weight was also calculated. Data was analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis and the least significant difference (LSD) tests. RESULTS: Pairwise comparisons of the subgroups 10 x 12 and 10 x 14 revealed significant differences for all mechanical properties (p< 0. 05). The {{results of this study suggest}} that when the goal is to construct appliances with high mechanical strength, regardless of weight, such as serial plaster slabs splints for stimulating tissue growth through the application of gradual load, splints made with <b>plaster</b> of Paris <b>bandages</b> with 12 or 14 layers should be preferred. For orthotic devices such as positioning orthotics, the use of 10 layers <b>plaster</b> <b>bandages</b> slab splints is advisable as they were found to have better correlation between mechanical strength and weight in comparison to those made wtih 6 or 8 layers. CONCLUSION: Based on the findings of this study, we suggest the use of 10 layers of plaster of Paris for the construction of orthopedic splints...|$|R
