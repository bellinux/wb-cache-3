Cafés are places where we are not simply served hot beverages but are also in some way partaking of a specific form of public life. It is this latter aspect that has attracted the attention of social theorists, especially Habermas, and lead them to locate the café as a key place in the development of modernity. Our approach to cafés is to 'turn the tables ' on theories of the public sphere and return to just what the life of a particular café consists of, and in so doing re-specify a selection of topics related to public spaces. The particular topics we deal with in a 'worldly manner ' are the socio-material organisation of space, informality and rule following. In as much as we are able we have drawn on an ethnomethodological way of doing and analysing our ethnographic studies. Introduction. Fig. 0 The Flaming Cup Suburbia. Nestling just off a traffic jammed city road, beside a hairdressers and a mobile phone shop, yellow paint flaking off to reveal a 60 's funky purple, is the 'Flaming Cup Café'. In the wind its metal <b>panel</b> <b>cut-out</b> cup, with flames, swings bac...|$|E

Many larger ATX cases {{can also be used}} with motherboards of other form factors.|$|R

The painted rectangular metal {{board at the}} backside, between the two wheels, leaves a trail of passion that the Rickshaw artist puts in his creations.|$|R
50|$|University of Denver {{station is}} an island platformed RTD light rail station in Denver, Colorado, United States. Operating {{as part of the}} E, F, and H Lines, the station was opened on November 17, 2006, and is {{operated}} by the Regional Transportation District. It serves the University of Denver and is located {{at the north end of}} campus on Buchtel Boulevard at High Street across from the Ritchie Center. The station features a public art installation entitled Reflective Discourse, consisting of a series of blue steel <b>panels</b> with <b>cut-out</b> words along the length of the station. It was created by John Goe and dedicated in 2006.|$|R

These {{differed from}} the first prototype in having a more conventional cabane consisting of a pyramid of four straight steel struts, a large clear-view <b>cut-out</b> <b>panel</b> in the starboard wing root to give improved view for landing and a single [...]303 in (7.7 mm) Vickers machine gun mounted on the port wing root.|$|R
40|$|Design {{development}} was successfully completed for textile preforms with continuous cross-stiffened epoxy <b>panels</b> with <b>cut-outs.</b> The preforms developed included 3 -D angle interlock weaving of graphite structural fibers impregnated by resin film infiltration (RFI) and {{shown to be}} structurally suitable under conditions requiring minimum acquisition costs. Design guidelines/analysis methodology for such textile structures are given. The {{development was}} expanded to a fuselage side-panel component of a subsonic commercial airframe and found to be readily scalable. The successfully manufactured panel was delivered to NASA Langley for biaxial testing. This report covers the work performed under Task 3 [...] Cross-Stiffened Subcomponent; Task 4 [...] Design Guidelines/Analysis of Textile-Reinforced Composites; and Task 5 [...] Integrally Woven Fuselage Panel...|$|R
25|$|During {{this same}} period appear the first 'invitation figures' (figura de convite), invented by the Master PMP and {{produced}} in the 18th and 19th centuries. These are <b>cut-out</b> <b>panels</b> of azulejos with life-size figures (footmen, halberdiers, noblemen or elegantly dressed ladies), usually placed in entrances of palaces (see Palácio da Mitra), patios and stair landings. Their purpose was to welcome visitors. They can only be found in Portugal.|$|R
40|$|Plates with {{variously}} shaped cut-out {{are often}} used in engineering structures. The understanding {{of the effect of}} cut-out on the load bearing capacity and stress concentration of panels is very important in designing of structures. Different cut-out shapes in structural elements are needed to reduce the weight of the structure or provide access {{to other parts of the}} structure. Extensive studies have been carried out on stress concentration in perforated <b>panels</b> which consider <b>cut-out</b> shapes, boundary conditions and bluntness of cut-outs. This study focuses on the stress concentration analysis of perforated panels with not only various cut-outs and bluntness but also different cut-out orientations. Therefore, at the design stage, once the direction of a major tensile force is known, the cut-outs can be aligned properly based on the findings of the work to reduce the stress concentration at the cut-outs thereby increasing the load bearing capacity of the pane...|$|R
500|$|Seeing Green's revealingly autobiographical Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary while in-progress in 1971 {{inspired}} Spiegelman {{to produce}} [...] "Prisoner on the Hell Planet", an expressionistic work {{that dealt with}} his mother's suicide; it appeared in 1972 in Short Order Comix 1, which he edited. [...] Spiegelman's work thereafter went through a phase of increasing formal experimentation; the Apex Treasury of Underground Comics in 1974 quotes him: [...] "As an art form the comic strip is barely in its infancy. [...] So am I. [...] Maybe we'll grow up together." [...] The often-reprinted [...] "Ace Hole, Midget Detective" [...] of 1974 was a Cubist-style nonlinear parody of hardboiled crime fiction full of non sequiturs. [...] "A Day at the Circuits" [...] of 1975 is a recursive single-page strip about alcoholism and depression in which the reader follows the character through multiple never-ending pathways. [...] "Nervous Rex: The Malpractice Suite" [...] of 1976 {{is made up of}} <b>cut-out</b> <b>panels</b> from the soap-opera comic strip Rex Morgan, M.D. refashioned {{in such a way as}} to defy coherence.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conceived}} in order to investigate the shear behaviour of the Precast Reinforced Concrete Wall <b>Panels</b> (PRCWP) with <b>cut-out</b> openings subjected to in-plane seismic loading conditions and to assess the shear capacity gain obtained using Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) composites as retrofit solution. The structural system of Precast Reinforced Concrete Large Panels (PRCLP) was extensively used in Romania, from 1950 to 1990, for housing buildings with 5 and 9 stories. Cut-out openings are often required to facilitate direct access from outside or between adjacent apartments, predominantly at the ground floor, where both gravity and seismic capacity demand is maximum. However, cut-out openings performed in structural walls results in the modification of the internal force flow paths, loss of load bearing capacity and reduced structural safety. Similar experimental researches are scarce in the literature. The earthquake resisting behaviour of Reinforced Concrete (RC) structural walls with openings, strengthened by Carbon FRP (CFRP) sheets and grids, was investigated in the post-damage repair and strengthening case. The shear and flexural strengthening effect of differently oriented CFRP sheets was examined on cantilever type RC shear walls in both prior-to-damage and post-damage situations. Experimental research was performed on high slenderness RC walls with door openings distributed on four height levels, strengthened with CFRP sheets. Godkänd; 2009; 20091214 (gabsas...|$|R

Iona Kirby for The Daily Mail wrote that Carey {{is known for}} her [...] "powerful voice, diva tendencies and voluptuous figure" [...] and that she has managed to combine all three qualities in the artwork for [...] "Triumphant (Get 'Em)". She continued describing Carey's gown as a [...] "flesh-coloured dress with <b>cut-out</b> <b>panels</b> and a saucy split up one side." [...] Kirby was complimentary of the artwork, writing that Carey [...] "sizzles" [...] on the cover and that the [...] "strapless frock leaves very little to the imagination as she smoulders for the camera." [...] A critic for the Belfast Telegraph also noted that Carey poses [...] "seductively" [...] for the shot. Robbie Daw for Idolator noted that it appeared as though the artwork had been photoshopped {{and that it is}} reminiscent of the cover art of Carey's tenth studio album, The Emancipation of Mimi (2005). Ayeesha Walsh for The Sun also noted a resemblance to the latter cover, writing [...] "The cover shots for 'Triumphant' are somewhat reminiscent... which also sees her wearing a figure hugging gold dress while she strikes a similar pose." [...] A writer from MTV found the shot [...] "endlessly entertaining", while Declan Cashin of The Independent wrote: [...] "Carey is depicted in golden hues as if she's radiating the precious shimmering element from her very being." ...|$|R
