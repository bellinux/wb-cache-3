40|$|This article {{shows that}} <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> has a {{democratic}} justification, {{although it is}} not necessary for democratic government and its virtues are controversial and often speculative. Against critics like Waldron and Bellamy, it shows that judges, no less than legislators, can embody democratic forms of representation, accountability and participation. Hence, <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> is not undemocratic simply because it enables unelected judges to over-rule elected legislators when people disagree about rights. Against recent defenders of <b>judicial</b> <b>review,</b> such as Eisgruber and Brettschneider, it shows that democratic arguments <b>for</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> do not require judges to be better at protecting rights than legislators. Hence a democratic justification <b>for</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> does not depend on complex and inevitably controversial interpretations and evaluations of judicial as opposed to legislative judgments. Democratic government does not demand special virtue, competence or wisdom in its citizens or their leaders. From a democratic perspective, therefore, the case <b>for</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> is that it enables individuals to vindicate their rights against government in ways that parallel those they commonly use against each other. This makes <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> normatively attractive whether or not it leads to better decisions than would be made by other means...|$|R
