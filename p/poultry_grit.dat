50|$|The domesticated {{rock dove}} is a grain eater. A staple diet must contain 12%-17% protein and <b>poultry</b> <b>grit.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Poultry</b> <b>grit</b> is a {{material}} fed to birds consisting mainly of crushed stone (though often with additives) which helps the bird's digestion grind their food. It is the birthstone for December.|$|E
50|$|In addition, 4.53 {{million tonnes}} of crushed stone {{was used for}} fillers and extenders (including asphalt fillers or extenders), 2.71 million tonnes for sulfur oxide removal-mine dusting-acid water treatment, and 1.45 million tonnes sold or used for <b>poultry</b> <b>grit</b> or mineral food.|$|E
5|$|The {{aim of the}} ducker was to {{get every}} {{duckling}} as fat as possible {{by the age of}} eight weeks (the first moult, the age at which they would be killed for meat), while avoiding any foods which would build up their bones or make their flesh greasy. In their first week after hatching, the ducklings would be fed on boiled eggs, toast soaked in water, boiled rice and beef liver. From the second week on, this diet would gradually be replaced by barley meal and boiled rice mixed with greaves. (Some larger-scale duckers would boil a horse or sheep and feed this to the ducklings in place of greaves.) This high-protein diet was supplemented with nettles, cabbage and lettuce to provide a source of vitamins. As with all <b>poultry,</b> ducks require <b>grit</b> in their diet to break up the food and make it digestible. Aylesbury ducklings' drinking water was laced with grit from Long Marston and Gubblecote; this grit also gave their bills their distinctive pinkish colour. Around 85% of ducklings would survive this eight-week rearing process to be sent to market.|$|R
50|$|Another {{advancement}} to the quarrying {{industry at}} Arabia Mountain was {{the discovery that}} adding granite grit to chicken feed helped with the birds’ digestion. The Davidson family, which owned several quarries in the area, became the largest supplier of <b>poultry</b> <b>grit</b> in the world. They claimed that the sparkling particles of mica in the Stonemo grit attracted the eye and helped the chicken’s gizzard break down food. The company was so successful in distributing their feed additive, a TIME Magazine article from 1941 reported the U.S. government allowed them to continue to operate during WWII {{in the name of}} national defense.In 1949, the Lithonia district produced nearly 1.5 million tons of granite valued at the time at $3 million.|$|E
