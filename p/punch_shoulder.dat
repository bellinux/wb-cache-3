2500|$|In the 16th century, {{the city}} of Florence celebrated the period between Epiphany and Lent by playing a game which today is known as [...] "calcio storico" [...] ("historic kickball") in the Piazza Santa Croce. The young aristocrats of the city would dress up in fine silk costumes and embroil {{themselves}} in a violent form of football. For example, calcio players could <b>punch,</b> <b>shoulder</b> charge, and kick opponents. Blows below the belt were allowed. The game {{is said to have}} originated as a military training exercise. In 1580, Count Giovanni de' Bardi di Vernio wrote Discorso sopra 'l giuoco del Calcio Fiorentino. This is sometimes said to be the earliest code of rules for any football game. The game was not played after January 1739 (until it was revived in May 1930).|$|E
40|$|A novel micro extra {{deep drawing}} process with {{ultrahigh}} fluid pressure and press motion controls are developed. A space between the blank and 1 st punch is made by the press motion at the 2 nd drawing stage and the ultrahigh pressure is applied {{so as to be}} disappeared this space. It can enhance a material flow into the die cavity because the ultrahigh pressure acts on the blank at side wall. In addition, a friction holding effect occurs, which prevents the thickness reduction at <b>punch</b> <b>shoulder</b> and side wall. Due to these mechanisms, the micro cup with aspect ratio of 2. 0 can be successfully fabricated by micro extra deep drawing in FE simulation, although it cannot be fabricated by conventional micro deep drawing and micro hydromechanical deep drawing...|$|E
5000|$|The {{series has}} {{received}} critical acclaim for performance and storyline. The acting performance of Siddhant Chaturvedi, Tanuj Virvani, Richa Chada and Sayani Gupta {{has been especially}} praised. India Today called the series [...] "perfectly cast and technically first rate". The Indian Express praised the performance of all actors saying that [...] "web-series packs interesting <b>punch</b> <b>shouldered</b> by some honest performances" [...] and also stated that the shows quality hasn't been compromised just because web series is a far smaller medium than films. Firstpost positively reviewed the series saying [...] "The characters are so seamlessly integrated into the narrative {{that it does not}} feel like a make believe world".|$|R
40|$|Production of {{cylindrical}} cups {{is one of}} {{the most}} important deep drawing processes. However, the process has some noticeable defects such as wrinkling, tearing, spring back, and thickness variation in different locations of produced cups. In this research the parameters of interest are punch/die shoulder radius, blank holder force, friction between sheet and die/punch/holder. To make the simulations ABAQUS finite element software, and to study the effects of these parameters, Taguchi method are used. To verify the study’s simulation results, experimental tests have been carried out. Studied locations include flange, die radius <b>shoulder,</b> wall thickness, <b>punch</b> radius <b>shoulder,</b> <b>punch</b> radius, the bottom of the cups. Also By applying Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) method the significance and magnitude of each parameter in determining the thickness in previously given locations are calculated in percentage. Finally, to get the initial blank thickness in different locations the optimum level of parameters is calculated...|$|R
500|$|When a {{cylinder}} is manufactured, its specification, including manufacturer, working pressure, test pressure, date of manufacture, capacity and weight are stamped on the cylinder. After {{a cylinder}} passes the test, the test date, (or the test expiry date {{in some countries}} such as Germany), is <b>punched</b> into the <b>shoulder</b> of the cylinder for easy verification at fill time. [...] The international standard for the stamp format is ISO 13769, [...] Gas cylinders - Stamp marking.|$|R
5000|$|On November 7, 2014, Ookay {{released}} his debut EP [...] "Ghost" [...] via Steve Aoki's label Dim Mak Records. When {{asked about his}} inspirations of creating the EP, Ookay said [...] "I really wanted to push the boundaries of my skill. It's kind of a <b>punch</b> in the <b>shoulder</b> to my fans who get mad when I make anything other than trap. So I made an entire EP that's pretty much not trap (except Egg Drop Soup). Really trying to convince everyone that i'm not a one-trick-pony".|$|R
5000|$|Suntukan {{is not a}} sport, {{but rather}} a street-oriented {{fighting}} system. The techniques have not been adapted for safety or conformance {{to a set of}} rules for competition, thus it has a reputation as [...] "dirty street fighting". It consists of upper-body striking techniques such as <b>punches,</b> elbows, headbutts, <b>shoulder</b> strikes and limb destruction. It is often used in combination with Sikaran, the kicking aspect of Filipino fighting which includes low-line kicks, tripping and knee strikes to the legs, shins, and groin. Common targets include the biceps, triceps, eyes, nose, jaws, temples, groin, ribs, spine, and the back of the neck.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{countries}} require diving cylinders to {{be checked}} on a regular basis. This usually consists of an internal visual inspection and a hydrostatic test. The inspection and testing requirements for scuba cylinders may {{be very different from}} the requirements for other compressed gas containers due to the more corrosive environment in which they are used. After a cylinder passes the test, the test date, (or the test expiry date in some countries such as Germany), is <b>punched</b> into the <b>shoulder</b> of the cylinder for easy verification at fill time. [...] The international standard for the stamp format is ISO 13769, Gas cylinders - Stamp marking.|$|R
40|$|With the {{interest}} for the technological options that were taken by the prehistoric groups to subsist, there is a field of research left empty in terms of archaeological records dated to the 8 th and 7 th millennia cal BC. It concerns the tool kit made from bone and antler used in Europe by stone knappers to work the lithic raw material by pressure and indirect percussion. Based on morpho-technological aspects, this paper presents a first list of recognized archaeological osseous artefacts employed in indirect and pressure lithic reduction. These are <b>punches,</b> pectoral and <b>shoulder</b> sticks, as well as bone elements involved in the lever systems. This investigation {{is made in the}} frame of a larger research project aiming at discussing both origin and agent responsible for the introduction of the “inset technology”dconical core pressure blade concept together with the slotted bone toolsdappearing in the southern Scandinavia at ca. 7300 cal BC. Results are promising and experiments enabling characterization of the bone and antler tools used in the debitage by pressure and indirect percussion will be soon undertaken...|$|R
5000|$|Han Sang-Jin (Tae Kwon Do): A {{former member}} of the Four Heavenly Dragons. He was only a member as part of his plan to exact revenge on the four dragons for what they did to his Tae Kwon Do Instructor, Ryu Nam-Jin. A natural born talent, Han Sang-Jin prefers [...] "real-life" [...] {{training}} and so participates in fights often. His initial goal is to defeat the man who defeated his Tae Kwon Do instructor. He defeats Woo So-Choi {{at the same time he}} defeats Jee Dae-Woong and Pi Ho-Chul, but loses in less than 3 minutes when he challenges Dokko Dae-San. After working on Tae Kwon Do's basic kicks and punches to perfection, he is able to do a Tae Kwon Do <b>punch</b> with full <b>shoulder</b> and back strength, and that punch is the one ton hit. When he participates in the Academy of Hell tournament, his first opponent is Lee Hae-Kang. He fights a good match, capable of bringing his opponent to the ground, while about 100 men wasn't able to make him move a single step but ultimately loses due to Lee Hae-Kang's immense stamina and resilience.|$|R
5000|$|On September 24, 2005 Peter faced Wladimir Klitschko in an {{elimination}} {{match in}} Atlantic City for the IBF title, in which Peter's NABF title {{was also on}} the line. It was a highly anticipated fight, Klitschko was trying to bounce back into the title picture and Peter {{was at the time}} undefeated and a feared puncher. It was a highly entertaining bout. Klitschko controlled for periods with his excellent jab and physical domination, yet Peter managed to periodically break through with big shots. Klitschko went down twice in the fifth, although the first KD was from an unabashed rabbit punch, commented on by the analysts, and the second was not actually a punch, but a missed <b>punch</b> and <b>shoulder</b> grab, forcing Klitschko down. The ref missed both, just [...] "didn't notice", although the analysts did. Klitschko continued to assert himself for the next few rounds as Peter grew frustrated at not only his inability to land clean shots, but at the very heavy punishment he was taking himself. In round 10 Peter finally broke through, by a last gasp effort, rushing Klitschko backwards right across the ring to the ropes. Klitschko pulled his head very sharply backwards and Peter just grazed his chin. Klitschko, falling back into the ropes, bounced off onto the canvas, and got upright away, ready for more. Larry Merchant remarked: [...] "This is the moment of truth for Klitschko." [...] Klitschko recovered well and went on to continue outboxing Peter for the final two rounds. All observers felt that Peter was hitting {{to the back of the}} head (rabbit punching) during this fight and that accounted for the first two knockdowns (although the second was from a different cause). Nevertheless, Klitschko went on to stagger Peter badly in the twelfth winning a unanimous decision, in which he won every round not involved in a KD, legal or not.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current study was to compare the {{kinematic}} variables of reverse and lead punching techniques. Fourteen male black belt karate practitioners were recruited. Each subject performed five reverse and five lead punches while measurements were taken for three-dimensional analysis. The analyses focused on the variable calculations for hip, shoulder, elbow, and wrist of the punching arm. The reverse punch had a peak resultant velocity (PRV) at the wrist of 5. 63 ?? 0. 87 m/s, while the lead punch had 4. 84 ?? 0. 84 m/s. Results indicated that there were significant differences in the peak resultant velocity at the wrist between the reverse and the lead techniques (p <. 01). Action time for the lead punch was significantly faster than the reverse punch, 169 ?? 31. 1 ms compared to 213 ?? 51. 6 ms (p <. 05). The linear displacements at the hip, shoulder, elbow, and wrist were all significantly greater in the reverse punch variation (p <. 05). Action time was associated with peak resultant velocity (PRV) measured at the wrist in the lead punch (r =. 55, p <. 05). PRV at hip, shoulder, and elbow was strongly associated with PRV at the wrist in both techniques (r =. 74, p <. 05; r =. 68, p <. 05; r =. 64, p <. 05; r =. 81, p <. 05; r =. 78, p <. 05; r =. 62, p <. 05). Range of motion at the shoulder and hip was statistically associated with PRV at the wrist for the reverse <b>punch,</b> while the <b>shoulder</b> and elbow were associated with the lead punch variation (r =. 54, p <. 05; r =. 7, p <. 05; r =. 47, p <. 05; r =. 33, p <. 05). Qualitative observations were made concerning inter-joint coordination, balance, and range of motion...|$|R
