5|$|Andrew James Alberts (born June 30, 1981) is an American {{professional}} {{ice hockey}} defenseman {{who is currently}} an Unrestricted Free Agent, having last played for the Vancouver Canucks of the National Hockey League (NHL). He additionally played in the NHL with the Boston Bruins, Philadelphia Flyers and Carolina Hurricanes. A stay-at-home defenseman, he was known for playing a <b>physical</b> <b>style</b> of game.|$|E
5|$|Iginla has {{recorded}} several Gordie Howe hat tricks – a fight, a goal and an {{assist in the}} same game – and as {{it is not an}} official statistic, The Hockey News estimated that as of 2012, he was the active leader with nine. His fights, including one with Tampa Bay Lightning star Vincent Lecavalier in the 2004 Stanley Cup Finals, have had a motivating effect on his play and that of his teammates. Iginla has suffered injuries {{as a result of his}} fighting, including a broken hand from a 2003 fight with Bill Guerin of the Dallas Stars. His <b>physical</b> <b>style</b> of play also leads to a greater risk of persistent injuries and penalties. Iginla's truculent style of play has gained approval from hockey commentator Don Cherry.|$|E
5|$|Playing a <b>physical</b> <b>style</b> again {{took its}} toll on Roberts' upper body, and he {{required}} surgery on both shoulders following the season. As a result, he missed the first {{four and a half}} months of the 2002–03 season; he appeared in only 14 games for Toronto. The Maple Leafs signed him to a one-year contract extension shortly after he returned from the injury. Roberts reached a career milestone midway through the 2003–04 season, as he played his 1,000th NHL game on January 13, 2004, a 4–1 victory over the Calgary Flames. He finished the season with 48 points in 72 games and played in his third All-Star Game.|$|E

5|$|In October 1956, Sunderland manager Bill Murray bought Revie for a £22,000 fee. Poor results {{left the}} Black Cats facing relegation {{towards the end}} of the 1956–57 campaign, but a late seven-game unbeaten run lifted them to safety, just one place above relegated Cardiff City. A {{financial}} scandal over illegal payments to players resulted in harsh sanctions at Roker Park from The Football Association and forced Murray's resignation. His replacement, Alan Brown, preferred a more <b>physical</b> <b>style</b> of play that did not suit Revie. Sunderland suffered relegation from the First Division for the first time in the club's history in the 1957–58 season, and Revie was dropped for the 1958–59 Second Division campaign in favour of a youth policy. In September 1958, he rejected the opportunity to sign for hometown club Middlesbrough – had he joined the club then he would have played alongside captain Brian Clough and goalkeeper Peter Taylor.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{smallest}} players of his generation, Fleury played a <b>physical</b> <b>style</b> that often led to altercations. As a junior, {{he was at the}} centre of the infamous Punch-up in Piestany, a brawl that resulted in the disqualification of both Canada and the Soviet Union from the 1987 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. Once considered unlikely to play in the NHL due to his small size, Fleury scored over 1,000 points in his career and won the Stanley Cup in 1989 with the Flames. He twice represented Canada at the Winter Olympics, winning a gold medal in 2002. Throughout his career, he battled drug and alcohol addictions that ultimately forced him out of the NHL in 2003. He played one season in the British Elite Ice Hockey League in 2005–06, and made two attempts to win the Allan Cup. After an unsuccessful NHL comeback attempt with the Flames, he retired in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Out of the {{original}} individual NHL trophies that were awarded prior to expansion (which would be followed by the creation of more individual awards), several players are tied with three awards in the same season. Stan Mikita won the Hart, Art Ross, and Lady Byng trophies, doing so consecutively in the 1966–67 and 1967–68 seasons. Guy LaFleur and Wayne Gretzky have each won the Art Ross, Hart, and Conn Smythe trophies, {{as well as the}} Cup, in 1976-77 and 1984–85, respectively. Bobby Orr won the Hart, Norris, and Conn Smythe trophies, along with the Stanley Cup, in 1969–70 and 1971-72. In 1970, Orr also won the Art Ross which makes him the only player to capture four original NHL awards in a single season (Orr also earned a NHL First Team selection, and the only honor which he was eligible for but did not win was the Lady Byng due to his <b>physical</b> <b>style</b> of play).|$|E

5|$|The Red Deer Rebels {{selected}} Phaneuf in {{the third}} round of the 2000 WHL Bantam Draft. One year later, he joined the Rebels for the 2001–02 season and recorded 17 points in 67 games. He added two assists in 21 games as the Rebels lost in the WHL Final against the Kootenay Ice. He improved to 16 goals and 30 points in 2002–03 as the Rebels again reached the WHL Finals, again losing, this time to the Kelowna Rockets. Phaneuf's development earned him comparisons to Hall of Famer Scott Stevens, as he was lauded by scouts for his <b>physical</b> <b>style</b> and ability to excel both defensively and offensively. Then-Calgary Flames General Manager Darryl Sutter valued Phaneuf so highly in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft that he attempted to trade up from his ninth overall selection in the Draft, though to no avail. Nonetheless, he was able to select Phaneuf with Calgary's first selection in the draft.|$|E
5|$|The current IIHF rules differ {{slightly}} from the rules used in the NHL. One difference between NHL and IIHF rules is standard rink dimensions: the NHL rink is narrower, measuring 61m×26m (200ft×85ft), instead of the international size of 61m×30.5m (200ft×100ft) The larger international size allows for a faster and less <b>physical</b> <b>style</b> of play. Another rule difference between the NHL and the IIHF rules concerns how icing is called. In the NHL, a linesman stops play due to icing if a defending player (other than the goaltender) is not behind an attacking player {{in the race to}} the end-zone faceoff dots in his defensive zone, in contrast to the IIHF rules in which play is stopped the moment the puck crosses the goal line. The NHL and IIHF also differ in penalty rules. The NHL calls five-minute major penalties for more dangerous infractions of the rules, such as fighting, in addition to the minor and double minor penalties called in IIHF games. This is in contrast to the IIHF rule, by which players who fight are ejected from the game. Beginning with the 2005–06 season, the NHL instituted several new rules. Some were already used by the IIHF, such as the shootout and the two-line pass. Others were not picked up by the IIHF, such as those requiring smaller goaltender equipment and the addition of the goaltender trapezoid to the rink. However, the IIHF did agree to follow the NHL's zero-tolerance policy on obstruction and required referees to call more hooking, holding, and interference penalties.|$|E
25|$|Jivamukti is a physical, ethical, {{and spiritual}} practice, {{combining}} a vigorous hatha yoga, vinyasa-based <b>physical</b> <b>style</b> with adherence to five central tenets: shastra (scripture), bhakti (devotion), ahimsa (nonviolence, non-harming), nāda (music), and dhyana (meditation). Animal rights, veganism, environmentalism, and social activism are also emphasized. Jivamukti Yoga {{has developed a}} reputation as the chosen yoga style of many celebrities.|$|E

50|$|At the {{far left}} end of the forecourt, atop the great arc of a wall {{connecting}} the extreme front and side walls of the Santuário, stands the statue of the prophet Amos. The style of Amos differs completely {{from all the other}} prophets in the group, although these differences are most noticeable in the <b>physical</b> <b>styling</b> of his garment. His broad face is beardless with a calm expression, almost good-natured as befits a man of the field. His garments suit the vocation of a shepherd. Amos is dressed in a sort of jacket lined with sheepskin, and features a cap on his head similar to those Portuguese farmers still wear in the region.|$|R
25|$|Both the Brazilian {{team that}} were crowned {{champions of the}} 1970 World Cup and the tournament itself have become {{regarded}} as among the very finest {{in the history of}} the FIFA World Cup. In contrast to the more <b>physical</b> <b>style</b> of play that had dominated the previous two tournaments, the 1970 Finals are noted for the attacking play adopted by most teams.|$|E
25|$|After {{failing to}} qualify for the 1974 FIFA World Cup, England manager Alf Ramsey is {{replaced}} by Don Revie (Colm Meaney), the highly successful manager of Leeds United. Revie's replacement at Leeds is Brian Clough (Michael Sheen), the former manager of Derby County and a fierce critic of Leeds, because of their violent and <b>physical</b> <b>style</b> of play under Revie's management. Furthermore, Clough's longtime assistant, Peter Taylor (Timothy Spall), has not joined him.|$|E

Tkachuk was known for his goal scoring prowess, scoring 30 goals eight times, including two 40-goal seasons and two back-to-back 50 goal seasons, the latter of which he led the NHL in goals, with 52.|$|E
50|$|W.A.K.O. World Championships 2001 {{were the}} joint thirteenth world kickboxing championships (the other was held {{later that year}} in Belgrade) hosted by the W.A.K.O. organization.

25|$|In the 2002–03 season, Essien {{developed}} into an undisputed starter under new manager Gérard Gili. However, his tenacious and <b>physical</b> <b>style</b> of play {{also began to}} take form as he collected a staggering 12 yellow cards in league play. He opened the new campaign by scoring on his season debut against Lens in a 1–1 draw and converted five more league goals, which included one in a surprising 2–0 victory over the defending champions Lyon. Following the campaign, in which Bastia finished mid-table {{for the third consecutive}} season, Essien drew interest from Paris Saint-Germain, Lyon and Marseille.|$|E
25|$|After {{becoming}} a free agent, Souray {{was signed by}} the Dallas Stars on July 1, 2011, to a one-year contract. Having recovered from his injuries, Souray made a successful comeback with the Stars, taking on more of a defensive role than in the recent past, particularly at even strength. However, he continued to still see plenty of ice time on the power play, where his slapshot could wreak havoc for opposing goaltenders, and was encouraged to use his shot as before. The Stars, meanwhile, while recognizing Souray's <b>physical</b> <b>style,</b> also openly declared {{that in order to}} preserve his health, they did not want him fighting very often, although they did not {{go so far as to}} dictate directly for him to never do so. On November 4, 2011, Souray reached a milestone when he scored the 100th NHL goal of his career in a 7–6 win over the Colorado Avalanche. Fittingly, it was a power play goal scored with a slapshot. Souray earned the respect of fans, teammates and local media in Dallas very quickly for his <b>physical</b> <b>style</b> of play and booming shot, and restored some of the goodwill that had been lost due to his spat with the Oilers. Most importantly, Souray was regularly healthy again. Despite missing a handful of games after sustaining an ankle injury blocking a shot in a December 23, 2011, win over the Nashville Predators, he had returned to the Dallas lineup by early January and was again a contributing member of their blueline corps. He finished the 2011–12 season with six goals, 15 assists and 21 points in 64 games.|$|E
25|$|The Hack-a-Shaq {{name was}} {{originally}} used during O'Neal's college playing days at LSU and during his NBA tenure with the Orlando Magic. At that time, however, the term referred simply to opposing teams employing an especially <b>physical</b> <b>style</b> {{of play in}} defending against O'Neal. Teams sometimes defended him by bumping, striking or pushing him after he received the ball {{in order to ensure}} that he did not score easily with layups or slam dunks. Because of O'Neal's poor free throw shooting, teams did not fear the consequences having personal fouls called against them when using such tactics. However, once Nelson's off-the-ball fouling strategy became prevalent, the term Hack-a-Shaq was applied to this new tactic, and the original usage was largely forgotten.|$|E
50|$|The {{technical}} {{platform that}} made the Eco-Drive concept possible was the Eco-Drive caliber 7878 movement. This movement was the first light powered movement where the solar cells could be mounted under the dial. Previous light powered watches from Citizen and other manufacturers had the solar cell(s) mounted directly on the dial.This innovation was enabled by marked improvements in thin film amorphous silicon solar cells, which, by the early 1990s had become significantly more efficient. By locating a sufficiently translucent dial material over the now more efficient solar cells, enough light could pass through the dial face to power the movement. Though the Eco-Drive caliber 7878 movement solar cells remained slightly visible through the dial, the <b>physical</b> <b>styling</b> of the light-powered watch was no longer constrained by visible solar cells.|$|R
5000|$|The Budapest {{event was}} open to amateur {{men and women from}} across the world - with 500 {{participants}} taking part from 47 countries. The styles on offer were Full-Contact, {{and for the first time}} ever at a W.A.K.O. championships, Low-Kick (more information on the styles can be found in the relevant sections below). Another first was that women could now take part in Full-Contact kickboxing, whereas before they could only take part in less <b>physical</b> <b>styles.</b> At the end of a very competitive championships, Poland were the top nation in terms of medals won, with Morocco a very close second and France just behind in third.

25|$|He {{played in}} 81 games during {{his rookie season}} and posted averages of 8.3 ppg, 4.8 rpg, 1.5 apg and 23.4 mpg. Nocioni's <b>physical</b> <b>style</b> of defense created {{controversy}} around the league, and he was suspended for one game after a hard foul to Detroit Pistons' Tayshaun Prince. Nocioni had previously committed a hard foul on the Miami Heat's Dwyane Wade and then was shoved past photographers and into the first row of spectators by Udonis Haslem. A spectator tossed a drink at Nocioni, which {{was similar to the}} incident that triggered Pacers–Pistons brawl at The Palace of Auburn Hills. The fan was ejected by security. For the incident, Nocioni received a flagrant-one foul (which is a foul involving excessive or unjustified contact) and a technical. Haslem received a technical and an ejection.|$|E
25|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the season, MacLeod left the team to become the head coach at the University of Notre Dame. President David Checketts reached out to Pat Riley, who was working as a commentator for the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), {{to see if he was}} interested in returning to coaching. Riley accepted the Knicks proposition on May 31, 1991. Riley, who coached the Lakers to four NBA titles during the 1980s, implemented a rough and <b>physical</b> <b>style</b> emphasizing defense. Under Riley, the team, led by Ewing and guard John Starks, who scored 24 points per game and 13.9 points per game respectively, improved to a 51–31 record, tying them for first place in the Atlantic Division. After defeating the Pistons in the first round of the playoffs, the team faced the Bulls, losing the series 4–3 in seven games. The 1992–93 season proved to be even more successful, as the Knicks won the Atlantic Division with a 60–22 record. Before the season, the Knicks traded Mark Jackson to the Los Angeles Clippers for Charles Smith, Doc Rivers, and Bo Kimble while also acquiring Rolando Blackman from the Dallas Mavericks. After defeating the Indiana Pacers and Charlotte Hornets in the first two rounds of the playoffs, the Knicks made it to the Eastern Conference finals, where once again they met the Bulls. After taking a two games-to-none lead, the Knicks lost the next four games.|$|E
