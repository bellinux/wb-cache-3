5|$|Rusli's {{family was}} not <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> the novel; his father {{condemned}} {{him in a}} letter, {{as a result of}} which Rusli never returned to Padang. His later novel, Anak dan Kemenakan (1958) was even more critical of older generation's inflexibility.|$|E
5|$|The Matsya Purana {{describes}} how Brahma, <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> a penance performed by Parvati, rewards her by blessing {{her with a}} golden complexion. This renders her more attractive to Shiva, to whom she later merges as one half of his body.|$|E

5|$|The “sea-bittered sailors” {{were not}} <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> these {{stringent}} regulations, and in 1825 the English whaler Daniel caused rioting {{in the town}} {{for three days and}} even gave out life threats to Reverend William Richards.|$|E

5|$|Ancient authors {{recorded}} that Alexander was so <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> {{portraits of}} himself created by Lysippos that he forbade other sculptors from crafting his image. Lysippos had often used the contrapposto sculptural scheme to portray Alexander and other characters such as Apoxyomenos, Hermes and Eros. Lysippos' sculpture, {{famous for its}} naturalism, {{as opposed to a}} stiffer, more static pose, is thought to be the most faithful depiction.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal's {{victory was}} the biggest in the Community Shield in 16 years. Wenger was <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> his team's {{performance}} and felt the win would provide a confidence boost for the coming season. Pellegrini's reaction was indifferent; he believed the absence of several first team players was linked to their poor show.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the mutiny, the {{division}} was moved to the Neuhammer training grounds in the Silesian region of Germany (present-day Poland) to complete its training.

5|$|Carson's supervisor, <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> {{the success}} of the radio series, asked her to write the {{introduction}} to a public brochure about the fisheries bureau; he also worked to secure her the first full-time position that became available. Sitting for the civil service exam, she outscored all other applicants and, in 1936, became the second woman hired by the Bureau of Fisheries for a full-time professional position, as a junior aquatic biologist.|$|E
5|$|Daphne du Maurier was <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> the {{adaptation}} of her story, and wrote to Nicolas Roeg to congratulate him for capturing the essence of John and Laura's relationship.

5|$|During {{post-production}} Welles {{and special}} effects artist Linwood G. Dunn experimented with an optical printer to improve certain scenes that Welles found unsatisfactory from the footage. Whereas Welles was often immediately <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> Wise's work, he would require Dunn and post-production audio engineer James G. Stewart to re-do their work several times {{until he was}} satisfied.|$|E

5|$|McGoohan was {{reportedly}} very <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> {{his role in}} the episode; when his wife Joan McGoohan, who is a real estate broker, helped staff writer Max Pross buy a house, she told him that Patrick McGoohan was as proud of the episode as anything in his career.|$|E
5|$|The BBC {{were also}} <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> {{the success of}} The Quatermass Experiment and in 1955 a sequel, Quatermass II, was broadcast, with John Robinson {{in the title role}} {{following}} Tate's death. This was followed in 1958 by Quatermass and the Pit, and both serials also had feature film versions made by Hammer. The character returned to television in a 1979 serial, simply titled Quatermass, for Thames Television.|$|E
5|$|The {{work was}} opened four months late on 18 October 1925 by Prince Arthur and the Reverend Alfred Jarvis. Despite the delay, the RAWCF and Jagger parted on very good terms, the {{committee}} exceptionally <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> the final memorial. Such was the toll taken on Jagger by finishing the Royal Artillery's memorial that after its unveiling he suspended work on all his other projects {{for six months}} to recuperate.|$|E

6000|$|But this {{argument}} {{strikes me as}} not a little remarkable in another particular--in its strong resemblance to the old argument for the [...] "divine right of kings." [...] By the latter, the king is to do just as he <b>pleases</b> <b>with</b> his white subjects, being responsible to God alone. By the former, the white man is to do just as he <b>pleases</b> <b>with</b> his black slaves, being responsible to God alone. The two things are precisely alike, and it is but natural that they should find similar arguments to sustain them.|$|R
5|$|Abrams {{had been}} rumored as {{director}} since December 2006, and NBC confirmed this the following month. He and Buffy the Vampire Slayer creator Joss Whedon were both hired to direct an episode during February sweeps week. Abrams had known cast member Kate Flannery years before, {{when he used}} to write in a restaurant where Flannery worked as a waitress. The two were reunited on The Office set, where he stated that he was <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> her success.|$|E
5|$|After he is accosted by Doerachman, Mardjan {{reveals that}} the letter which Doerachman signed was {{actually}} a statement granting Mardjan all of the hadji's wealth.

After a lengthy knife fight, Mardjan's foot is caught in the railroad tracks, and he is soon killed by a passing train. Doerachman, <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> the return of his wealth, destroys the letter and grants Rachmat permission to marry Atikah.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{left the}} Black Order because the {{previous}} story arc {{had too many}} characters and required too much effort. Hoshino was <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> her portrayal of Allen's farewell to comrade Lenalee Lee because it indicated that the character had matured. She noted that Allen had grown taller; early in the series, he and Lenalee were the same height. Hoshino said that although Allen's departure fit the series' tragic theme, he would always have comrades. Allen and Kanda part on good terms in the previous story arc despite their frequent arguments, and Hoshino said that Kanda would assist him in the next storyline.|$|E
