5|$|Madagascar {{not only}} {{contains}} two radically different climatic zones, the rainforests {{of the east}} and the dry regions of the west, but also swings from extended drought to cyclone-generated floods. These climatic and geographical challenges, along with poor soils, low <b>plant</b> <b>productivity,</b> wide ranges of ecosystem complexity, and a lack of regularly fruiting trees (such as fig trees) have driven the evolution of lemurs' immense morphological and behavioral diversity. Their survival has required the ability to endure the persistent extremes, not yearly averages.|$|E

40|$|Although {{recent studies}} have found a {{positive}} relationship between spending on information technology and firm productivity, the magnitude of this relationship has not been as dramatic as one would expect given the anecdotal evidence. Data collected by the Bureau of the Census is analyzed to investigate the relationship between plant-level productivity and spending on IT. This relationship is investigated by separating the manufacturing plants in the sample along two dimensions, total factor productivity and IT spending. Analysis along these dimensions reveals that there are significant differences between the highest and lowest <b>productivity</b> <b>plants.</b> The highest <b>productivity</b> <b>plants</b> tend to spend less on IT while the lowest <b>productivity</b> <b>plants</b> tend to spend more on IT. Although there is support for the idea that lower <b>productivity</b> <b>plants</b> are spending more on IT to compensate for their productivity shortcomings, the results indicate {{that this is not the}} only difference. The robustness of this finding is strengthened by investigating changes in productivity and IT spending over time. High <b>productivity</b> <b>plants</b> with the lowest amounts of IT spending tend to remain high <b>productivity</b> <b>plants</b> with low IT spending while low <b>productivity</b> <b>plants</b> with high IT spending tend to remain low <b>productivity</b> <b>plants</b> with high IT spending. The results show that management skill, as measured by the overall productivity level of a firm, is an additional factor that must be taken into consideration when investigating the IT "productivity paradox.

25|$|Critics {{pointed out}} that the world is not always green, and that when it is, herbivores do not {{necessarily}} {{play an important role in}} structuring plant communities (Ehrlich and Birch 1967). Others argued that what is green is not always edible or of sufficiently high quality to allow increases in herbivore populations (Dixon 1966, Murdoch 1966). The debate is ongoing, but the dominant view of ecologists remains that although consumers affect many aspects of <b>plant</b> <b>productivity</b> and ecology, top-down control does not drive the productivity of entire plant ecosystems.|$|E
25|$|Other {{eutrophication}} studies {{performed in}} Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island found that experimental nitrogen addition initially increases <b>plant</b> <b>productivity</b> but eventually leads to reduced plant biomass due to insect herbivory (Bertness et al. 2008). To supplement this experiment, researchers took surveys across 20 salt marshes {{to look at}} the interaction between marsh nutrient levels and herbivore pressure and found that marsh nitrogen supply was a good predictor of herbivore damage to plants. This study suggests that eutrophication is currently triggering consumer suppression of primary productivity in New England salt marshes and may eventually pose a threat to salt marsh ecosystem service provisioning (Bertness et al. 2008).|$|E
25|$|Research on {{the salt}} marsh snail Littoraria irrorata {{and its effects}} on marsh <b>plant</b> <b>productivity,</b> have {{provided}} strong evidence of consumer control in marshes triggered by overexploitation. This snail is capable of turning strands of cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) (>2.5m tall) into mudflats within 8 months, which is less than one growing season (Silliman and Bertness 2002). As previously referenced, marsh snails inflict cuts on cordgrass leaves when they graze, providing substratum and nutrients for fungus. At high snail densities, cordgrass can succumb to fungal infections and marsh die-off can ensue (Silliman and Bertness 2002, Silliman and Newell 2003, Silliman et al. 2005). Natural predators of the marsh snail are blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) and terrapin turtles (Malaclemys terrapin), which historically regulated snail abundances. However, these predators have been commercially overexploited, and now suffer from diseases due to small population size, releasing the snails from consumer pressure, and allowing the snails to wreak havoc on salt marsh cordgrass populations (Silliman and Zieman 2001).|$|E

40|$|Although {{patterns}} between plant {{diversity and}} ecosystem productivity {{have been much}} studied, a consistent relationship has not yet emerged. Differing patterns between <b>plant</b> diversity and <b>productivity</b> have been observed in response to spatial variability of environmental factors and vegetation composition. In this study, we measured vegetation cover, <b>plant</b> diversity, <b>productivity,</b> soil properties and site characteristics along an environmental gradient (mobile dune, semi-fixed dune, fixed dune, dry meadow, wet meadow and flood plain grasslands) of natural sandy grasslands in semiarid areas of northern China. We used multivariate analysis to examine the relationships between environmental factors, vegetation composition, <b>plant</b> diversity and <b>productivity.</b> We found {{a positive correlation between}} <b>plant</b> diversity and <b>productivity.</b> Vegetation composition aggregated by the ordination technique of non-metric multidimensional scaling had also a significantly positive correlation with <b>plant</b> diversity and <b>productivity.</b> Environmental gradients in relation to soil and topography affected the distribution patterns of vegetation composition, species diversity and productivity. However, environmental gradients were a better determinant of vegetation composition and <b>productivity</b> than of <b>plant</b> diversity. Structural equation modeling suggested that environmental factors determine vegetation composition, which in turn independently drives both <b>plant</b> diversity and <b>productivity.</b> Thus, the positive correlation between <b>plant</b> diversity and <b>productivity</b> is indirectly driven by vegetation composition, which is determined by environmental gradients in soil and topography...|$|R

500|$|Having {{evolved in}} Madagascar's {{challenging}} environment, replete with poor soils, extreme shifts in poor, seasonal <b>plant</b> <b>productivity,</b> and devastating climatic {{events such as}} extended droughts and annual cyclones, lemurs have adopted unique combinations of unusual traits to survive, distinguishing them significantly from other primates. [...] In response to limited, seasonal resources, lemurs may exhibit seasonal fat storage, hypometabolism (including torpor and hibernation in some cheirogaleids), small group sizes, low encephalization (relative brain size), cathemerality (activity both day and night), and/or strict breeding seasons. [...] Secondarily, extreme resource limitations and seasonal breeding {{are thought to have}} resulted in three other relatively common lemur traits: female dominance, sexual monomorphism (lack of size differences between the sexes), and maleâ€“male competition for mates involving low levels of agonism (conflict), such as sperm competition.|$|E

2500|$|Since Glomeromycota fungi live {{inside plant}} roots, {{they can be}} {{influenced}} substantially by their plant host and in return affect plant communities as well. Plants can allocate up to 30% of their photosynthate carbon to AM fungi [...] and in return AM fungi can acquire up to 80% of plant phosphorus and nitrogen. The diversity of AM fungal communities has been positively linked to plant diversity, <b>plant</b> <b>productivity</b> and herbivory. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi can be influenced by small scale interactions with the local plant community. For example, the plant neighborhood around a focal plant can alter AM fungal communities as can the order of plant establishment within sites.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} impact of trade reforms on the {{evolution}} of <b>plantâ€™s</b> <b>productivity.</b> We use <b>plant</b> level panel data of Chileanâ€™s manufacturing for the period 1979 - 2000. The main contribution of the paper is to construct detailed measures of trade liberalization disentangling {{the impact of}} export and import oriented policies. Firstly, we estimate the production functions to obtain factor contributions and to compute plantâ€™s TFP controlling for firm heterogeneous productivity which is unobservable and evolves over the time. Secondly, we construct a measure of market access as an outcome of trade policies by estimating the difficulties to trade (border effects) between Chile and its main trading partners at the industry level and across time using a gravity model. Finally, we estimate the impact of trade reform on <b>plantâ€™s</b> <b>productivity</b> using the border effects estimated in the previous step. We find evidence of a positive impact of export oriented policies on productivity of traded sectors relative to non traded. On the other hand, relative to the latter, the reduction of import barriers might {{have a positive impact on}} productivity in export oriented sectors, but it hurts local firms in import competing ones probably due to the existence of increasing returns...|$|R
