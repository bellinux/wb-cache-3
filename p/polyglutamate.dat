Two cell lines (MCF- 7 and ZR- 75 -B) converted the drug to γ-polyglutamate derivatives in a dose- and time-dependent reaction. After 24 -h incubations with 2 μM MTX, <b>polyglutamates</b> of two to five amino acids in length accounted for 55. 4 % (51. 9 nmol/g) of intracellular drug in the MCF- 7 cells and 87. 6 % (62. 4 nmol/g) of drug in ZR- 75 -B cells. In contrast, MDA- 231 cells showed lesser accumulation of MTX, and only 32 % (4. 06 nmol/g) of the intracellular drug was {{in the form of}} <b>polyglutamates,</b> a difference that could only partially be explained by decreased ability of these cells to take up free drug from the medium. When MCF- 7 and ZR- 75 -B cells containing <b>polyglutamates</b> were transferred to drug-free medium for 24 h, 22 and 51 % of the total intracellular drug were, respectively, retained in each cell line. The loss of intracellular drug was primarily accounted for by disappearance of parent compound and <b>polyglutamates</b> containing 1 - 3 additional glutamyl residues. The rates of disappearance from cells decreased with increasing glutamyl chain length. All of the 4 -NH 2 - 10 -CH 3 -PteGlu 5 and 47 and 38 % of the 4 -NH 2 - 10 -CH 3 -PteGlu 4 remained in the MCF- 7 and ZR- 75 -B cells, respectively, and could be identified in the cytosol after 24 h in drug-free medium. The retention of MTX <b>polyglutamates</b> in these two cell lines in excess of dihydrofolate reductase binding capacity led to prolonged inhibition of thymidylate synthesis and loss of cell viability after removal of extracellular MTX. After 24 -h incubation with 2 μM MTX and an additional 24 h in drug-free medium, [3 H]deoxyuridine incorporation was still inhibited to 30 % of control in the MCF- 7 cells and 34. 7 % of control in ZR- 75 -B cells; this persistent inhibition was associated with a 30 % reduction in cell numbers in each cell line during the 24 -h period in drug-free medium.

40|$|The {{nature of}} pteroyl <b>polyglutamates</b> in uninfected and T 4 D bacteriophage-infected Escherichia coli B has been examined. 3 H-p-aminobenzoic acid {{has been used}} to label the folate {{compounds}} and gel permeation chromatography on glass beads to separate the folate compound by molecular size. It has been found that, although the major folate compound in uninfected bacteria is pteroyl triglutamate, E. coli B cells also contain folate compounds having as many as six glutamate residues. Infection with T 4 D stimulated the addition of glutamate residues to the lower-molecular-weight host pteroyl compounds, resulting in the conversion of the host compounds into the hexaglutamate form. This viral-induced conversion is chloramphenicol sensitive and appears to be due to a late phage gene product. The phage gene responsible for this conversion has not been identified.

Accordingly, we undertook a systematic analysis of available evidence to determine the clinical utility of dosing methotrexate to a target red blood cell methotrexate <b>polyglutamate</b> concentration. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify all studies that had reported an association between red blood cell methotrexate <b>polyglutamate</b> concentration and disease activity or adverse drug reactions in users of methotrexate {{for the treatment of}} rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis or psoriatic arthritis. RESULTS: No randomised controlled trials were identified. Thirteen studies (ten in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and three in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis) were identified. All studies evaluated an association between red blood cell methotrexate <b>polyglutamate</b> concentration and response to treatment, and eight evaluated an association with toxicity. Eight studies identified lower disease activity with at least one higher red blood cell methotrexate <b>polyglutamate</b> concentration, although there was at least moderate potential for bias in all of these studies. Relatively large increases in concentration appeared to be required to produce a meaningful reduction in disease activity. Only one study identified an association between red blood cell methotrexate <b>polyglutamate</b> concentration and methotrexate-induced side effects, although studies were likely underpowered to detect this type of association.

As an example of the utility of SPICE 2 for large metabolic systems which involve nonlinear kinetics, feedback inhibition of a number of kinds and branching pathways, the cellular folate metabolism scheme is modeled. This scheme is a source of intermediates for de novo purine and pyrimidine metabolism utilized in DNA and RNA synthesis. The action of antifolates that specifically inhibit the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), is simulated in some detail. In particular, the potential of feedback inhibition of secondary sites by dihydrofolate (DHF) <b>polyglutamates</b> that accumulate in the presence of antifolates is modeled to investigate the possible role of such inhibition as opposed, or in addition to, the classical role of tetrahydrofolate (THF) cofactor depletion in the suppression of purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis after blockage of DHFR. The interplay of mathematical modeling, computer simulation, network thermodynamics and experimental observations gave rise to the following conclusions: (1) THF cofactor depletion alone can account for the rapid cessation of purine and pyrimidine synthesis in S-phase cells by antifolates; (2) feedback inhibition by DHF <b>polyglutamates</b> need not be implemented in the mechanism of antifolate inhibition; and (3) the lack of complete interconversion of THF cofactors to DHF does not appear to be related to inhibition of thymidylate synthase by DHF <b>polyglutamates,</b> since this would only slow the accumulation of but not change the final DHF and THF levels in cells with antifolates...|$|R

Our studies with thymidylate synthase from L. casei have shown that the bacterial enzyme also exhibits a greatly increased affinity for <b>polyglutamate</b> vs. monoglutamate derivatives of folic acid, and that reversal in the order of substrate addition and product release also occurs with <b>polyglutamate</b> as compared with monoglutamate substrates. We have also studied the <b>polyglutamate</b> specificity of methionine synthase, which is responsible for the conversion of CH 3 [...] -H 4 PteGlu 1 into H 4 PteGlu 1. This reaction is required for the incorporation of plasma folate into the cellular folate pool, because methyltetrahydrofolate is a poor substrate for folylpolyglutamate synthetase. Our studies demonstrate that CH 3 [...] -H 4 PteGlu 1 metabolism is potently inhibited in the presence of CH 3 [...] -H 4 PteGlu 6, and suggest that incorporation of plasma CH 3 [...] -H 4 PteGlu 1 will only occur when methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase is inhibited by adenosylmethionine and cellular pools of CH 3 [...] -H 4 PteGlu 6 are at very low levels...|$|E
40|$|Formiminotransferase (EC 2. 1. 2. 5) -cyclodeaminase (EC 4. 3. 1. 4) catalyzes two {{sequential}} H(, 4) folate-dependent reactions. With derivatives of the H(, 4) folate substrate having 4, 5, or 6 glutamyl residues, the formiminoH(, 4) pteroylpolyglutamate {{formed by}} the transferase activity is preferentially transferred (channeled) to the deaminase site rather than released into the solution. This channeling is essentially complete with the pentaglutamate derivative. The enzyme has highest affinity for the hexaglutamate as measured by K(,d) and K(,m), but does not show specificity for a given <b>polyglutamate</b> as measured by V(,m) /K(,m). The results indicate that steric length of the <b>polyglutamate</b> chain, not simply affinity, is critical for optimal channeling. Binding studies demonstrate four sites for the binding of H(, 4) pteroylpolyglutamates to the native octamer, suggesting the formation of sites between subunits. The transferase and deaminase sites are kinetically independent, but share a common <b>polyglutamate</b> subsite. The results support the concept that the <b>polyglutamate</b> chain anchors the H(, 4) folate molecule during its transfer between active sites...|$|E
40|$|The {{cell wall}} of an alkalophilic strain of Bacillus sp. C- 125 is {{composed}} of A 1 gamma-peptidoglycan, a teichuronic acid and an unknown acidic polymer composed of glutamic acid and glucuronic acid, of which the molar ratio is approx. 4 - 5 : 1. Poly(gamma-L-glutamate) was prepared from the acidic polymer by removal of {{almost all of the}} glucuronic residues with trifluoromethanesulphonic acid treatment and purified chromatographically. The Mr of the <b>polyglutamate</b> preparation was estimated to be 14, 000 by gel chromatography, or 43, 000 {{on the basis of the}} content of N-terminal acid residues. The acidic polymer found in the cell wall of the organism was concluded to be a <b>polyglutamate</b> substituted with (oligo) glucuronic acid residues or a complex composed of two kinds of polymers (<b>polyglutamate</b> and polyglucuronate) ...|$|E
40|$|Uroporphyrin I (URO I) {{accumulation}} {{has been}} reported in the bone marrow of rats exposed to lead, suggesting a sensitivity of uroporphyrinogen III cosynthase (COSYN) to this heavy metal. Furthermore, it {{has been reported}} that a <b>polyglutamated</b> folate derivative may serve as a coenzyme for the catalytic action of hepatic uroporphyrinogen III cosynthase. These findings raised the question of whether depletion of <b>polyglutamated</b> folate could enhance the susceptibility of bone marrow COSYN to lead and potentially interfere with the formation of heme. Nitrous oxide, an anesthetic agent capable of causing bone marrow tetrahydrofolate deficiency, depressed total bone marrow <b>polyglutamated</b> folate content by 42 % with significant reductions in all three chain lengths (5 - 7) identified in the bone marrow during an exposure period of 7 days at 4 hr/day. Lead acetate (15 mg/kg) administered by ip injection at Days 0 and 2 during a 7 -day exposure to nitrous oxide resulted in an 84 % increase of bone marrow URO I content, which was markedly higher than the increases of 22 and 38 % seen with sole administration of lead or nitrous oxide, respectively. The combination of agents also produced a 48 % rise in COPRO I, a 39 and 43 % decrease in COPRO III and protoporphyrin, respectively, and a 42 % decline in the activity of microsomal 7 -ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase, which is hemoprotein, cytochrome P- 450 mediated. Heme oxygenase activity was not altered by nitrous oxide, lead, or their combination. These results suggest that bone marrow folate deficiency may render COSYN more sensitive to lead as characterized by increased uroporphyrin I and coproporphyrin I isomer content, decreased coproporphyrin III and protoporphyrin content, and depressed microsomal hemoprotein, cytochrome P- 450 -mediated drug-metabolizing capability...|$|R
40|$|Plant tissues contain highly {{conjugated}} {{forms of}} folate. Despite this, {{the ability of}} plant folate-dependent enzymes to utilize tetrahydrofolate <b>polyglutamates</b> has not been examined in detail. In leaf mitochondria, the glycine-cleavage system and serine hydroxymethyltransferase, present in large amounts in the matrix space and involved in the photorespiratory cycle, necessitate the presence of tetrahydrofolate as a cofactor. The aim of the present work {{was to determine whether}} glutamate chain length (one to six glutamate residues) influenced the affinity constant for tetrahydrofolate and the maximal velocities displayed by these two enzymes. The results show that the affinity constant decreased by at least one order of magnitude when the tetrahydrofolate substrate contained three or more glutamate residues. In contrast, maximal velocities were not altered in the presence of these substrates. These results are consistent with analyses of mitochondrial folates which revealed a pool of <b>polyglutamates</b> dominated by tetra and pentaglutamates. The equilibrium constant of the serine hydroxymethyltransferase suggests that, during photorespiration, the reaction must be permanently pushed toward the formation of serine (the unfavourable direction) to allow the recycling of tetrahydrofolate necessary for the operation of the glycine decarboxylase T-protein...|$|R
