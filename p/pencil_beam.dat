This acoustic scattering is analogous to the scattering of the light from a car's headlights in fog: a high-intensity <b>pencil</b> <b>beam</b> will penetrate the fog to some extent, but broader-beam headlights emit much light in unwanted directions, much of which is scattered back to the observer, overwhelming that reflected from the target ("white-out").

40|$|Reflections from lens {{surfaces}} create parasitic beams {{that can}} damage optics in high-powered laser systems. These parasitic beams {{are low in}} energy initially, because of the low reflectivity of antireflection (AR) coated lens surfaces {{and because they are}} clipped by spatial filter pinholes, but subsequent amplification can raise them to damage fluence levels. Also, some of the <b>pencil</b> <b>beams</b> in multipass laser systems become pre-pulses at the output by by-pass one of more of the passes, arriving at the output ahead of the main pulse in time. They are insidious because <b>pencil</b> <b>beams</b> that are not initially a problem can become so due to a slow degradation of the AR coatings.

Independent handling of <b>pencil</b> <b>beams</b> in conventional pencil-beam algorithms causes unphysical collimator-height dependence {{in the middle of}} large fields, which is resolved by the framework comprised of generation, transport, collimation, regeneration, range-compensation, and edge-sharpening processes with a matrix of <b>pencil</b> <b>beams.</b> The model was verified to be consistent with measurement and analytic estimation at a submillimeter level in penumbra of individual collimators with a combinational-collimated carbon-ion beam.

40|$|In this work, a novel {{three-dimensional}} superposition algorithm for photon dose calculation is presented. The dose calculation {{is performed}} as a superposition of <b>pencil</b> <b>beams,</b> which are modified based on tissue electron densities.

40|$|Purpose: To {{introduce}} {{and evaluate}} the use of stable distributions {{as a means of}} describing the behavior of charged particle <b>pencil</b> <b>beams</b> in a medium, with specific emphasis on proton beam scanning (PBS). Methods: The proton <b>pencil</b> <b>beams</b> of a clinically commissioned proton treatment facility are replicated in a Monte Carlo simulation system (FLUKA). For each available energy the beam deposition in water medium is characterized by the dose deposition. Using an alpha [...] stable distribution methodology each beam with a nominal energy E is characterized by the lateral spread at depth z: S(z;α,γ,E) and a total energy deposition I_D(z). The beams are then described {{as a function of the}} variation of the parameters at depth. Finally, an implementation in a freely available open source dose calculation suite (matRad, DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany) is proposed. Results: Quantitatively, the fit of the stable distributions, compared to those implemented in standard treatment planning systems, are equivalent. The efficiency of the representation is better (2 compared to 3 and more parameters needed). The meta [...] parametrization (i. e. the description of the dose deposition by only providing the fitted parameters) allows for interpolation of non [...] measured data. In the case of the clinical data used in this paper, it was possible to only commission 1 out of 5 nominal energies to obtain a viable data set. Conclusions: Alpha [...] stable distributions are intrinsically suited to describe charged particle <b>pencil</b> <b>beams</b> in a medium and can be easily implemented in existing treatment planning systems. The use of alpha-distributions can easily be extended to other particles...|$|R

40|$|A semiempirical {{method to}} {{characterize}} the pencil-beam dose kernel is presented. Results from measurements are described by mathematical models of the applicable physical processes. The measurements were made with 6 and 25 MV x-ray beams from a linear accelerator. Broad-beam notations were used consistently, and the pencil-beam quantities were obtained by differentiation. The results were compared to pencil-beam kernels calculated by Monte Carlo techniques. The analysis of the measured data included a number of approximations. It was assumed that all the constituent <b>pencil</b> <b>beams</b> {{in the field are}} parallel, i. e., the divergence is ignored. Furthermore, the lateral variations of the incident photon fluence and the energy spectrum were disregarded. Monte Carlo calculations, on the other hand, are based on an average energy spectrum over the field, and are free from divergence and variations in the incident photon fluence. Measured and Monte Carlo calculated <b>pencil</b> <b>beams</b> nevertheless agreed well, and the approximations mentioned caused at maximum 2. 7 % discrepancies for the largest field size at 6 MV...|$|R

Mpc- 1; 1 pc = 3. 09 x 10 (16) m). A deep redshift survey with a "pencil-beam" geometry of galaxies at the galactic poles indicated strong clustering, with a provocative regularity at 128 h- 1 Mpc [Broadhurst, T. J., Ellis, R.

40|$|The null {{hypothesis}} that the three dimensional power spectrum measured from the APM Survey {{is consistent with the}} one dimensional power spectrum measured from the <b>pencil</b> <b>beams</b> surveys of Broadhurst et al and of Szalay et al is tested. The external estimates of the mean power that we make are sensitive to details of the model for the survey geometry and to the assumed level of the distortion of the pattern of galaxy clustering caused by peculiar motions. We find that the measured 3 D clustering of galaxies can account for the presence of peaks in the one dimensional power spectrum, but is less successful in recovering the detailed appearence of the observations. We find no strong evidence for any additional large scale structure in the deep <b>pencil</b> <b>beams</b> beyond that recovered from the APM Survey. We conclude therefore that it is unlikey that large scale structure can be responsible for the steep local number counts of bright galaxies.

40|$|Although the Monte Carlo (MC) method allows {{accurate}} dose calculation for proton radiotherapy, its usage {{is limited}} due to long computing time. In {{order to gain}} efficiency, a new macro MC (MMC) technique for proton dose calculations has been developed. The basic principle of the MMC transport is a local to global MC approach. The local simulations using GEANT 4 consist of mono-energetic proton <b>pencil</b> <b>beams</b> impinging perpendicularly on slabs of different thicknesses and different materials (water, air, lung, adipose, muscle, spongiosa, cortical bone). During the local simulation multiple scattering, ionization as well as elastic and inelastic interactions have been taken into account and the physical characteristics such as lateral displacement, direction distributions and energy loss have been scored for primary and secondary particles. The scored data from appropriate slabs is then used for the stepwise transport of the protons in the MMC simulation while calculating the energy loss along the path between entrance and exit position. Additionally, based on local simulations the radiation transport of neutrons and the generated ions are included into the MMC simulations for the dose calculations. In order to validate the MMC transport, calculated dose distributions using the MMC transport and GEANT 4 have been compared for different mono-energetic proton <b>pencil</b> <b>beams</b> impinging on different phantoms including homogeneous and inhomogeneous situations {{as well as on}} a patient CT scan. The agreement of calculated integral depth dose curves is better than 1 % or 1  mm for all <b>pencil</b> <b>beams</b> and phantoms considered. For the dose profiles the agreement is within 1 % or 1  mm in all phantoms for all energies and depths. The comparison of the dose distribution calculated using either GEANT 4 or MMC in the patient also shows an agreement of within 1 % or 1  mm. The efficiency of MMC is up to 200  times higher than for GEANT 4. The very good level of agreement in the dose comparisons demonstrate that the newly developed MMC transport results in very accurate and efficient dose calculations for proton beams...|$|R
