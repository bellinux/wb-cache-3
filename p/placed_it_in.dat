5|$|Dru Drury, who {{described}} the moth in 1773, <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the genus Papilio, considering it a butterfly. Jacob Hübner <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the moth genus Chrysiridia in 1823. Later redescriptions led to junior synonyms such as Chrysiridia madagascariensis (Lesson, 1831).|$|E
5|$|Lundomys molitor {{was first}} {{described}} in 1887 by Danish zoologist Herluf Winge, who reviewed the materials Peter Wilhelm Lund had {{collected in the}} caves of Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Winge used four specimens for his description, including two skull fragments and an isolated maxilla (upper jaw) from the cave chamber Lapa da Escrivania Nr.5 and a mandible (lower jaw) from Lapa da Serra das Abelhas, but the latter later {{turned out to be}} from a different species, probably Gyldenstolpia fronto. Lund named the animal Hesperomys molitor and <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the same genus (Hesperomys) as what is now Pseudoryzomys simplex and two species of Calomys. Subsequently, it was rarely mentioned in the literature on South American rodents; those authors who did mention it <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> either Oryzomys or Calomys.|$|E
5|$|The {{assignment}} of Calostoma to the Boletales <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> an order whose biochemistry {{has been the}} topic of research. Most members of the Boletales are characterized by compounds produced by the shikimate-chorismate pathway, including several distinctive pigments.|$|E

50|$|The Cronquist {{system of}} 1981 {{recognize}}s the family but <b>places</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the water lily order Nymphaeales. The Dahlgren system of 1985 and Thorne system of 1992 both recognize {{the family and}} <b>place</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> its own order, Nelumbonales.|$|R
50|$|The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group in the 2009 {{revision}} <b>place</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> family Asparagaceae, subfamily Brodiaeoideae (having previously placed treated Brodiaeoideae as {{a separate}} family Themidaceae).

5|$|The {{church has}} not been {{conclusively}} dated. Art historian André Grabar <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the 14th century, scholar Nikola Mavrodinov dated it to the 13th century, while archaeologist Krastyu Miyatev is {{of the opinion that}} both theories are equally likely. Architecture writer Stefan Stamov gives a possible range from the 12th to the 14th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} scientifically by American mycologist Howard James Banker in 1913. Italian Pier Andrea Saccardo placed the {{species in the}} genus Hydnum in 1925, while Walter Henry Snell and Esther Amelia Dick <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> Calodon in 1956; Hydnum peckii (Banker) Sacc. and Calodon peckii Snell & E.A. Dick are synonyms of Hydnellum peckii.|$|E
5|$|Volvopluteus earlei is {{a species}} of {{mushroom}} in the family Pluteaceae. It was originally described in 1911 by American mycologist William Alphonso Murrill as Volvariopsis earlei, based on collections made in a Cuban banana field. The fungus was later shuffled to the genera Volvaria and Volvariella before molecular studies <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> Volvopluteus, a genus newly described in 2011.|$|E

Fictional rivers in the county include the River Mercer, the River Perch and the River Am. There is also a fictional Felpersham Canal. There are railway stations at Felpersham and at Hollerton Junction (nearer to Ambridge).|$|R
5|$|Banksia ericifolia has {{traditionally}} been described as lying within series Spicigerae of Banksia, together with Banksia spinulosa and various western Hairpin-like Banksias such as B.seminuda and B.brownii. This series is placed in Banksia sect. Oncostylis according to Alex George's taxonomy of Banksia, but directly into Banksia subg. Banksia in Thiele's arrangement based on cladistic analysis. Kevin Thiele additionally <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> a subseries Ericifoliae, {{but this was not}} supported by George.|$|E
5|$|Imsai Arasan 23rd Pulikecei {{became an}} {{important}} film in Vadivelu's career. It continued a trend of films with different themes that focused on social issues. K.

Another critic from The Hindu, Sumit Bhattacharjee, compared it with other period films like The Ten Commandements (1956) Ben-Hur (1959) Titanic (1997), Gladiator (2000), 300 (2007) and Jodhaa Akbar (2008).|$|E
5|$|It {{was first}} {{described}} by Brown & Kempf in 1968 {{based on two}} workers collected in a Berlese sample of humus in El Salvador. Due to morphological similarities, they considered it a very primitive ant and <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> {{what was then a}} myrmicine tribe, the Agroecomyrmecini, together with ants known from Early Eocene Baltic amber (Agroecomyrmex) and late Eocene Florissant shale (Eulithomyrmex).|$|E

5|$|Myriostoma {{had been}} {{classified}} in the family Geastraceae until 1973, when British mycologist Donald Dring <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the Astraeaceae based {{on the presence of}} trabeculae (stout columns that extend from the peridium to the central core of the fruit body) in the gleba, and the absence of a true hymenium. In his 1989 monograph, Stellan Sunhede returned it to the Geastraceae. Molecular analysis of DNA sequences has confirmed the traditional belief that Myriostoma and Geastrum are closely related.|$|E
5|$|Myrmecia {{has been}} {{classified}} into numerous families and subfamilies; in 1858 British entomologist Frederick Smith <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the family Poneridae, subfamily Myrmicidae. It {{was placed in}} the subfamily Ponerinae by Austrian entomologist Gustav Mayr in 1862. This classification was short-lived, as Mayr reclassified the genus into the subfamily Myrmicinae three years later. In 1877, Italian entomologist Carlo Emery classified the genus into the newly established subfamily Myrmeciidae, family Myrmicidae. Smith, who had originally established Myrmicidae as a family in 1851, reclassified it as a subfamily in 1858. He would again treat it as a family in 1871. Swiss myrmecologist Auguste Forel initially treated Poneridae as a subfamily and classified Myrmecia as one of its constituent genera, but later <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> Ponerinae. William H. Ashemad placed the genus in the subfamily Myrmeciinae in 1905, but it was later placed back in Ponerinae in 1910 by American entomologist William Morton Wheeler. In 1954, Myrmecia was placed into Myrmeciinae; this would be the last time the genus would be placed into a different ant subfamily.|$|E
5|$|The Greek text of {{the codex}} is a {{representative}} of the Caesarean text-type. It belongs to the textual family f13, known also as Ferrar Family. Also the handwriting and the menology show that is a close member of the group. According to Kurt and Barbara Aland it agrees with the Byzantine standard text 151 times, and 72 times with the Byzantine when it has the same reading as the original text. It agrees 31 times with the original text against the Byzantine. It has 57 independent or distinctive readings. Alands <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> Category III.|$|E

5|$|The current taxonomic {{arrangement}} of the Banksia genus is based on George's 1999 monograph for the Flora of Australia book series. In this arrangement, B.integrifolia is placed in Banksia subg. Banksia, because its inflorescences {{take the form of}} Banksias characteristic flower spikes; Banksia sect. Banksia because of its straight styles; and Banksia ser. Salicinae because its inflorescences are cylindrical. Kevin Thiele additionally <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> a subseries Integrifoliae, but this was not supported by George.|$|E
5|$|The current taxonomic {{arrangement}} of the Banksia genus is based on botanist Alex George's 1999 monograph for the Flora of Australia book series. In this arrangement, B.oblongifolia is placed in Banksia subgenus Banksia, because its inflorescences {{take the form of}} Banksias characteristic flower spikes, section Banksia because of its straight styles, and series Salicinae because its inflorescences are cylindrical. In a morphological cladistic analysis published in 1994, Kevin Thiele <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the newly described subseries Acclives along with B.plagiocarpa, B.robur and B.dentata within the series Salicinae. However, this subgrouping of the Salicinae was not supported by George.|$|E
5|$|The {{first known}} {{specimen}} {{was obtained by}} W.G. Palmer in 1904 and the next year, Oldfield Thomas of the British Museum of Natural History described this animal as the holotype of a new species he named Nectomys dimidiatus. He <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the genus Nectomys, commenting that it was much smaller than but otherwise similar to previously known members of that genus. The species was listed as a Nectomys in taxonomic overviews in the next decades, including a 1944 review of the genus by Philip Hershkovitz.|$|E

However, today the IOC World Bird List <b>places</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the genus Gorsachius, while BirdLife International and the Handbook of the Birds of the World <b>place</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> Calherodius. <b>Its</b> name derives from {{a patch of}} white feathers that form a triangle on its back.|$|R
5|$|The first {{scientific}} {{description of}} the banded houndshark was authored by German biologists Johannes Peter Müller and Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle, based on a dried specimen from Japan, in their 1838–41 Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen. They gave it the specific epithet scyllium, derived from the Ancient Greek skylion ("dogfish"), and <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the genus Triakis. Within the genus, it {{is placed in the}} subgenus Triakis along with the leopard shark (T. (Triakis) semifasciata).|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} in 1774 by German naturalist Jacob Christian Schäffer as Agaricus bombycinus. Throughout its taxonomical history, {{it has been}} shuffled to several genera, including Pluteus (by Elias Fries in 1836), Volvaria (Paul Kummer, 1871), and Volvariopsis (William Alphonso Murrill, 1911). Rolf Singer <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> its current genus, Volvariella, in 1951. Other names that have been applied to the species include Jean-Baptiste Lamarck's Amanita calyptrata and August Johann Georg Karl Batsch's Agaricus denudatus (both published in 1783), but these are illegitimate names as Schäffer's earlier 1774 name has priority.|$|E
5|$|The type {{specimen}} for this species was {{collected from the}} Port Jackson area (Sydney district) and was described by botanist Robert Brown in 1810, who gave it the specific epithet juniperina which alludes to its juniper-like foliage. Likewise it {{is commonly known as}} juniper- or juniper-leaf grevillea, as well as prickly spider-flower. The lectotype was selected by Don MacGillivray in 1993 from a collection by George Caley in 1803 11km (7mi) northwest of Prospect in what is now Sydney's outer western suburbs. Brown <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the series Lissostylis in his 1810 work Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen.|$|E
