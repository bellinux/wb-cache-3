25|$|Continuous {{auditing}} {{is often}} confused with computer-aided auditing. The <b>purpose</b> <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> {{of the two}} techniques, however, are quite different. Computer-aided auditing employs end user technology including spreadsheet software, such as Microsoft Excel, to allow traditional auditors to run audit-specific analyses as they conduct the periodic audit. Continuous auditing, on the other hand, involves advanced analytical tools that automate {{a majority of the}} auditing plan. Where auditors manually extract data and run their own analyses in computer-aided auditing during the course of their traditional audit, high-powered servers automatically extract and analyze data at specified intervals as a part of continuous auditing.|$|E

TxDOT also announced it was reverting to building I-69 as a standard 4-lane freeway instead of a multi-modal corridor as previously envisioned under the Trans-Texas Corridor concept. The latest plan called for adding a second carriageway and eliminating at-grade intersections along US-59 and US-77 in rural areas, with tolled bypasses around major cities and towns along the I-69 route.|$|E

In addition to authoring tools and LMSs, there are other types of tools in which the application of patterns may be useful. This paper points out these tools locating them along the “life cycle ” of the scripts. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{issue of}} sustainability, or {{deciding}} how to survive {{within the limits of}} the world’s resources and social systems, is the most significant problem facing every society in the world today. Evaluation studies of environmental education indicate that, despite the growing interest in environmental education and the expectations of governments that it will contribute to sustainability, schools and teachers experience difficulty in effectively implementing it. It is suggested that one major reason for this is the low level of pre-service study or in-service professional development for teachers in environmental education. This monograph aims to provide guidance to teacher education institutions in Asia and the Pacific on the preparation of teachers for teaching and learning for a sustainable environment. A competency-based model of teacher education for environmental education is proposed. The chapters address the three major themes of the nature, <b>purposes</b> <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> of environmental education, Asia-Pacific initiatives in this area, and recommendations for the promotion of environmental education in teacher education...|$|R
