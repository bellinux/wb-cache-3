2500|$|The Players Championship is {{the only}} event, apart from the majors and the World Golf Championships, which attracts entries from {{almost all of the}} world's elite golfers. It is the {{designated}} OWGR flagship event for the PGA Tour and awards 80 OWGR points to its winner. Only major championships can be awarded more OWGR points. For purposes of the FedEx Cup standings, The Players has had an identical <b>point</b> <b>allocation</b> to that of the majors since the Cup was instituted in 2007.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} [...] "Order of Merit", {{created for}} the 1975/1976 season and based on just World Championship results, awarded the winner five points, the runner-up four, and so on down to one point for players who lost in the last 16. The world rankings, introduced in the following year, used the same allocation. Subsequent tournaments that were assigned ranking status worked on the same system but with the World Championship from 1983 onwards carrying double points. The ranking <b>point</b> <b>allocation</b> was later revised slightly with winners of all bar the World Championship now receiving six points, runners-up five, down to one point for the last 32; the World Championship more or less stayed as it was with ten points for the winner, incrementally reduced by two points for each preceding round, but now awarded one point for the last 32 {{in line with the}} other tournaments. In addition to ranking points, merit and frame points were also awarded which were used as a tie-break when players were on equal ranking points. When the game went open for the 1991/1992 season, the ranking point allocations (devised by the WPBSA chairman {{on the back of a}} cigarette pack) were altered by several factors to accommodate the influx of new players. The tie-break system was dropped but the system remained basically the same with players awarded incrementally more points for each successive round; should a seeded player lose their first match they would receive only half the points allocated to the non-seeded losers in that round. The World Championship continued to award more points than the other events but under the [...] "open era" [...] system the allocations often varied between other events too, with the UK Championship traditionally having the second-highest tariff. The Players Tour Championship—a secondary professional tour introduced in the 2010/2011 season comprising a series of minor events—also carried ranking points, but at a much lower tariff. The ranking point schedule was replaced by a prize money list for the 2014/2015 season, with prize money earnings in events carrying ranking status contributing to a players ranking.|$|E

25|$|In {{previous}} years a complicated system of <b>points</b> <b>allocation</b> was used, {{depending on how}} strong the opponent was, and how large the loss margin, which allowed weaker losing teams to gain points when playing a much stronger opposition, if they managed {{to put up a}} decent match. With the new system, the <b>points</b> <b>allocation</b> is simpler: three points for a win, one point for a draw, and zero points for a loss, in line with most league systems around the world.|$|R

50|$|Once {{a player}} is {{accepted}} in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament or ATP World Tour Masters 1000 tournament, his result in this tournament counts for his ranking, regardless of whether he participates.

Further non-consecutive withdrawals results in a zero <b>point</b> <b>allocation</b> replacing the next best positive result for each additional withdrawal.|$|E
5000|$|If the {{robustness}} curves of two allocations, [...] and [...] are compared, {{the fact that}} the two curves will intersect is noticeable, as illustrated in Figure 8. In this case, none of the allocations is strictly more robust than the other: for critical revenues smaller than the crossing <b>point,</b> <b>allocation</b> [...] is more robust than allocation , while the other way around holds for critical revenues higher than the crossing point. That is, the preference between the two allocations depends on the criterion of failure - the critical revenue.|$|E

In episode 11 of season 6, Dara admitted that winners of each round and <b>point</b> <b>allocation</b> was not based on anything specific, and viewers should [...] "stop e-mailing in."

5000|$|The game {{includes}} first-person and third-person views, a classless system, Player-versus-Player combat, mounted combat, crafting, and a noise-based stealth system. Fallen Earth offers customizable features, including: clothing, facial features, skin tones, hairstyles and colors, age, {{body and}} facial hair, body art (tattoos and piercings), height, and makeup. Also after this process players can add points to their character to build strength and other skills. Fallen Earth {{does not have}} a fixed class system. It uses skill-based character development with a strong emphasis on flexibility and player preference. The game features active skills—trade-skills as well as mutation-based skills—which can be increased through Advancement Points (APs) or skill usage. Advancement Points are earned alongside level experience, and aside from increasing skill points, {{can also be used to}} boost Attributes. Players can undo and [...] "re-spec" [...] their skill <b>point</b> <b>allocation.</b>|$|E
50|$|The game {{introduces}} {{a number of}} new features to the series, including the Master System, which allows any of the game's playable characters to apprentice under specific non-player characters known as masters, which allows them to learn new skills and influence their statistics. An additional feature, the Fairy Village, gives the player the ability to influence the growth of a small town of faeries, which in turn gives them access to special items or in-game features such as mini-games and a sound test. While journeying on the world map, players may set up camp, which can replenish a character's health by resting, as well as allowing them to speak directly to any member of their party. Other series mainstays such as fishing return with a new, expanded interface and <b>point</b> <b>allocation</b> system that keeps track of what fish a player has caught and their size.|$|E

40|$|Two {{apparently}} similar {{methods for}} making numerical judgments about {{a set of}} objects (<b>point</b> <b>allocation</b> and direct rating) {{have been shown to}} yield different profiles of values (here, numerical judgments) attached to Ranks. Direct rating typically leads to a nearly linear relationship of Value with Rank. When using <b>point</b> <b>allocation,</b> people tend to produce a half U-shape of Value with Rank, evidenced by a positive quadratic term in Rank, which is not present for direct rating. We argue that <b>point</b> <b>allocation</b> imposes a fixed-sum frame on the judgment task. Furthermore, certain problems, such as allocating a budget, are intrinsically framed as fixed-sum. These problems also lead to quadratic curvature of numerical judgment with Rank.
