In this paper, two kinds of <b>path</b> expression optimizing principles are proposed, named <b>path</b> shorten and <b>path</b> complementing, respectively. The <b>path</b> shorten principle reduces the querying cost by shortening the <b>path</b> expressions with the knowledge of XML schema.

The experimental results show that these two techniques can work on most <b>path</b> expression queries and largely improve the efficiency of <b>path</b> expression query processing...|$|R

5|$|At an intersection, the {{incoming}} and outgoing lanes of traffic (including {{the ends of}} pedestrian crosswalks and bicycle lanes as well as lanes for motor vehicles) may be represented as the vertices of a graph, placed on the spine of a book embedding in their clockwise order around the junction. The <b>paths</b> through the intersection taken by traffic to get from an incoming lane to an outgoing lane may be represented as the edges of an undirected graph. For instance, this graph might have an edge from an incoming to an outgoing lane of traffic that both {{belong to the same}} segment of road, representing a U-turn from that segment back to that segment, only if U-turns are allowed at the junction. For a given subset of these edges, the subset represents a collection of <b>paths</b> that can all be traversed without interference from each other if and only if the subset does not include any pair of edges that would cross if the two edges were placed in a single page of a book embedding. Thus, a book embedding of this graph describes a partition of the <b>paths</b> into non-interfering subsets, and the book thickness of this graph (with its fixed embedding on the spine) gives the minimum number of distinct phases needed for a signalling schedule that includes all possible traffic <b>paths</b> through the junction.|$|E

5|$|Directed acyclic graphs {{may also}} be used as a compact {{representation}} of a collection of sequences. In this type of application, one finds a DAG in which the <b>paths</b> form the given sequences. When many of the sequences share the same subsequences, these shared subsequences can be represented by a shared part of the DAG, allowing the representation to use less space than it would take to list out all of the sequences separately. For example, the directed acyclic word graph is a data structure in computer science formed by a directed acyclic graph with a single source and with edges labeled by letters or symbols; the <b>paths</b> from the source to the sinks in this graph represent a set of strings, such as English words. Any set of sequences can be represented as <b>paths</b> in a tree, by forming a tree vertex for every prefix of a sequence and making the parent of one of these vertices represent the sequence with one fewer element; the tree formed in this way for a set of strings is called a trie. A directed acyclic word graph saves space over a trie by allowing <b>paths</b> to diverge and rejoin, so that a set of words with the same possible suffixes can be represented by a single tree vertex.|$|E
