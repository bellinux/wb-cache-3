50|$|Aging {{factors can}} be defined as {{irreparable}} damages to cellular components which ultimately contribute to the decreased fitness of the individual harbouring them. Putative aging factors include damaged DNA strands, old cell-surface material, and mis-folded or aggregated protein. The cell poles of replicating E. coli are often used as a proxy for aging factors as each bacterium inherits an old cell-pole (mother’s pole) and a newly synthesized new cell-pole. Inclusion bodies, masses of aggregated damaged or mis-folded proteins, have recently been shown to contribute to the aging of cellular organisms.Senescence in single celled organisms is thought to arise via the asymmetric partitioning of aging factors between daughter cells. It has long been argued that, on theoretical grounds, the <b>preferential</b> <b>segregation</b> of damage in unicellular organisms would contribute to the fitness of the overall population. The single celled eukaryotic organism, Sacchoaromyces cerevisiae, retains deleterious aging factors in the mother cell leading to rejuvenation of the daughter.|$|E

In their paper, a double-implantation annealing process was applied to fabricate an Er-doped SRSO layer. This double process may stimulate Er diffusion explaining the segregation of Er and Si during the different implantation stages, which is contrary to our case.|$|E

The tuning of size of RhPt nanoparticles was achieved by changing the concentration of rhodium and platinum precursors in one-step polyol synthesis. We obtained two dimensional Rh 0. 5 Pt 0. 5 bimetallic nanoparticle arrays in size between 5. 7 nm and 11 nm. CO oxidation was carried out on these two-dimensional nanoparticle arrays, revealing higher activity on the smaller nanoparticles compared to the bigger nanoparticles. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results indicate the <b>preferential</b> surface <b>segregation</b> of Rh compared to Pt on the smaller nanoparticles, {{which is consistent with}} our thermodynamic analysis. Because the catalytic activity is associated with differences in the rates of O- 2 dissociative adsorption between Pt and Rh, we suppose that the surface segregation of Rh on the smaller bimetallic nanoparticles is responsible for the higher catalytic activity in CO oxidation.

40|$|Although {{selection}} of chromosomally normal embryos {{has the potential}} to improve outcomes for patients undergoing IVF, the clinical impact of aneuploidy screening by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has been controversial. There are many putative explanations including sampling error due to mosaicism, negative impact of biopsy, a lack of comprehensive chromosome screening, the possibility of embryo self-correction and poor predictive value of the technology itself. Direct analysis of the negative predictive value of FISH-based aneuploidy screening for an embryo's reproductive potential has not been performed. Although previous studies have found that cleavage-stage FISH is poorly predictive of aneuploidy in morphologically normal blastocysts, putative explanations have not been investigated. The present study used a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray-based 24 chromosome aneuploidy screening technology to re-evaluate morphologically normal blastocysts that were diagnosed as aneuploid by FISH at the cleavage stage. Mosaicism and <b>preferential</b> <b>segregation</b> of aneuploidy to the trophectoderm (TE) were evaluated by characterization of multiple sections of the blastocyst. SNP microarray technology also provided the first opportunity to evaluate self-correction mechanisms involving extrusion or duplication of aneuploid chromosomes resulting in uniparental disomy (UPD). Of all blastocysts evaluated (n = 50), 58 % were euploid in all sections despite an aneuploid FISH result. Aneuploid blastocysts displayed no evidence of <b>preferential</b> <b>segregation</b> of abnormalities to the TE. In addition, extrusion or duplication of aneuploid chromosomes resulting in UPD did not occur.

40|$|Caustic dissolution, {{when used}} as a {{pretreatment}} for etching of aluminum in chloride solutions, is observed to increase the rate of pit nucleation. Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) and Auger electron spectroscopy were {{used to measure the}} composition in the near‐surface region of 99. 98 % purity aluminum after dissolution in 1 N NaOH at room temperature. During dissolution, concentrations of impurities such as Fe, Cu, and Ga were found to accumulate continuously within a layer less than about 10 nm thick adjacent to the surface, because they dissolved more slowly than did aluminum. Impurity concentrations on the order of 1 atom percent (a/o) in this layer, much higher than equilbrium values, were found after 40 min dissolution. It is argued that the large impurity concentrations are consistent with a highly defective region in the metal near the metal/oxide interface, which has been detected using positron annihilation measurements. Dissolution produced a scalloped surface topography with typically 30 nm high ridges separated by 130 nm. A simulation of RBS measurements based on scattering from spherical particles was developed to test for the possibility of <b>preferential</b> impurity <b>segregation</b> to ridges. No such segregation was detected, suggesting {{that this is not the}} reason for the strong tendency for pit nucleation to occur on ridges, as has been observed previously...|$|R

The affects of copolymer compositions, the electrospinning tip-to-collector (TCD) distance and the concentration of the polymer solution on the fiber morphology are discussed. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) were used to establish the surface topography {{as well as the}} fiber morphology of the electrospun copolymer nanofibers.

The rate and extent of this recovery depends on the PDMS content of the nanofibers as well as the time of corona treatment.

We run {{direct numerical simulation}} (DNS) of turbulent channel flow at shear Reynolds number Re(tau) = 150 and corresponding a priori and a posteriori LES on two coarser grids. For each flow field, we tracked swarms of particles with different inertia to examine the behavior of particle statistics, specifically focusing on particle <b>preferential</b> <b>segregation</b> and accumulation at the wall. Our object is to discuss {{the necessity of a}} closure model for the particle equations when using LES and we verify if the influence of the subgrid turbulence filtered by LES is an important effect on particle motion according to particle size. The results show that well-resolved LES gives particle velocity statistics in satisfactory agreement with DNS. However, independent of the grid, quantitatively inaccurate predictions are obtained for local particle <b>preferential</b> <b>segregation,</b> particularly in the near-wall region. Inaccuracies are observed for the entire range of particle size considered in this study, even when the particle response time is much larger than the flow time scales not resolved in LES. The satisfactory behavior of LES in reproducing particle velocity statistics is thus counterbalanced by the inaccurate representation of local segregation phenomena, indicating that closure models supplying the particle motion equation with an adequate rendering of the flow field might be needed. Finally, we remark that recovering the level of fluid and particle velocity fluctuations in the particle equations does not ensure a quantitative replica of the subgrid turbulence effects, thus implying that accurate subgrid closure models for particles may require information also proportional to the higher-order moments of the velocity fluctuations...|$|E

In cultured hippocampal neurons, we observed an ankyrin G- and F-actin-dependent structure {{that emerged in the}} cytoplasm of the axon initial segment (AIS) within 2 days after axon/dendrite differentiation, imposing a selective filter for diffusion of macromolecules and transport of vesicular carriers into the axon. Axonal entry was allowed for KIF 5 -driven carriers of synaptic vesicle protein VAMP 2, but not for KIF 17 -driven carriers of dendrite-targeting NMDA receptor subunit NR 2 B. Comparisons of transport rates between chimeric forms of KIF 17 and KIF 5 B, with the motor and cargo-binding domains switched, and between KIF 5 loaded with VAMP 2 versus GluR 2 suggest that axonal entry of vesicular carriers depends on the transport efficacy of KIF-cargo complexes.

The surface {{molecular}} {{motion of}} monodisperse proton-terminated polystyrene (PS-H), α,ω-diamino-terminated PS (α,ω-PS(NH 2) 2) andα,ω-dicarboxy-terminated PS (α,ω-PS(COOH) 2) films was studied by scanning viscoelasticity microscopy {{in conjunction with}} lateral force microscopy. The glass transition temperature Tg, at the surface, T sg, {{was found to be}} markedly lower than bulk Tg, T bg, and the number-average molecular weight, Mn, dependence of T sg was more remarkable than that of T bg. Also, the magnitude of T sg was strongly dependent on the chain end chemistry. Hence, the activation of surface molecular motion was explained in terms of an excess free volume induced by the <b>preferential</b> surface <b>segregation</b> of chain end groups. The chain end segregation at the film surface was confirmed by dynamic secondary ion mass spectroscopic measurement. However, the T sg for the PS-H with quasi-infinite Mn was lower than the corresponding T bg, even though the number density of chain ends was almost negligible. In addition, T sg s for PS films with hydrophilic chain ends, which might be depleted at the film surface, were lower than the bulk values. The apparent activation energy for the surface micro-Brownian motion corresponding to the αa-relaxation process was approximately half of the bulk value. Finally, the depression of T sg in comparison with T bg is discussed on the basis of several factors, such as a decreased segment size of molecular motion for the surface αa-relaxation process due to the existence of the free space on the polymer surface and/or a reduced chain entanglement at the surface, in addition to the chain end effect. 1...|$|R

This region was distorted only in DI//D population while certain region was normally segregated in a Mendelian fashion in other three female-segregating populations (ID//D, ID//I, and DI//I).

40|$|Karyotype, {{chromosome}} number and composition, {{is a basic}} characteristic of species and its changes are frequently associated with speciation. Karyotype conversion, from mostly telocentric (centromere terminal) to mostly metacentric (centromere internal), typically reflects fixation of Robertsonian (Rb) fusions, a common chromosomal rearrangement that joins two telocentric chromosomes at their centromeres to create one metacentric. Fixation of Rb fusions {{can be explained by}} meiotic drive: biased chromosome segregation during female meiosis. However, there is no mechanistic explanation of why fusions preferentially segregate to the egg in some populations, leading to fixation and karyotype change, while other populations preferentially eliminate the fusions and maintain a telocentric karyotype. Using laboratory models and wild mice, we show that differences in centromere strength predict the direction of drive. Stronger centromeres, with higher kinetochore protein levels and altered interactions with spindle microtubules, are preferentially retained in the egg. Rb fusions preferentially segregate to the polar body in laboratory mouse strains when the fusion centromeres are weaker than those of telocentrics. Conversely, fusion centromeres are stronger relative to telocentrics in natural house mouse populations that have changed karyotype by accumulating metacentric fusions. ^ <b>Preferential</b> chromosome <b>segregation</b> is predicted to depend on spindle asymmetry. We show that meiosis I (MI) spindles are asymmetric, with more stable microtubules (MTs) oriented towards the cortex. Based on our observations we propose a model in which a signal from the cortex induces MT asymmetry. ^ We exploit Rb fusions to study mechanisms of meiotic chromosome segregation when erroneous kinetochore-MT attachments are recognized and destabilized. Improper attachments typically lack tension between kinetochores and are positioned off-center on the spindle. Low tension is a widely accepted mechanism for recognizing errors, but whether chromosome position regulates MT attachments is unknown. We show that proximity to spindle poles destabilizes kinetochore-MTs, and that stable attachments are restored by inhibiting Aurora A kinase at spindle poles. During the correction of attachment errors, kinetochore MTs detach near spindle poles to allow formation of correct attachments. We propose that chromosome position on the spindle provides spatial cues for the fidelity of meiotic cell division. ...|$|R
50|$|Grain {{boundaries}} are the <b>preferential</b> site for <b>segregation</b> of impurities, which may form {{a thin layer}} with a different composition from the bulk. For example, {{a thin layer of}} silica, which also contains impurity cations, is often present in silicon nitride. These grain boundary phases are thermodynamically stable and can be considered as quasi-two-dimensional phase, which may undergo to transition, similar to those of bulk phases. In this case structure and chemistry abrupt changes are possible at a critical value of a thermodynamic parameter like temperature or pressure. This may strongly affect the macroscopic properties of the material, for example the electrical resistance or creep rates. Grain boundaries can be analyzed using equilibrium thermodynamics but cannot be considered as phases, because they do not satisfy Gibbs'definition: they are inhomogeneous, may have a gradient of structure, composition or properties. For this reasons they are defined as complexion: an interfacial material or stata that is in thermodynamic equilibrium with its abutting phases, with a finite and stable thickness (that is typically 2-20 Å). A complexion need the abutting phase to exist and its composition and structure need to be different from the abutting phase. Contrary to bulk phases, complexions also depend on the abutting phase. For example, silica rich amorphous layer present in Si3N3, is about 10 Å thick, but for special boundaries this equilibrium thickness is zero. Complexion can be grouped in 6 categories, according to their thickness: monolayer, bilayer, trilayer, nanolayer (with equilibrium thickness between 1 and 2 nm) and wetting. In the first cases the thickness of the layer will be constant; if extra material is present it will segregate at multiple grain junction, while in the last case there is no equilibrium thickness and this is determined by the amount of secondary phase present in the material. One example of grain boundary complexion transition is the passage from dry boundary to biltilayer in Au-doped Si, which is produced by the increase of Au.|$|R
40|$|The Saltstone Sampling and Analyses Plan {{provides}} {{a basis for}} the quantity (and configuration) of saltstone grout samples required for conducting a study directed towards correlation of the Performance Assessment (PA) related properties of field-emplaced samples and samples processed and cured in the laboratory. The testing described in the saltstone sampling and analyses plan will be addressed in phases. The initial testing (Phase I) includes collecting samples from the process room in the Saltstone Production Facility (SPF) and transporting them to Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) where they will cure under a temperature profile that mimics the temperature in the Saltstone Disposal Unit (SDU) and then be analyzed. SRNL has previously recommended that after the samples of fresh (uncured) saltstone are obtained from the SPF process room, they are allowed to set prior to transporting them to SRNL for curing. The concern was that if the samples are transported before they are set, the vibrations during transport may cause artificial delay of structure development which could result in <b>preferential</b> settling or <b>segregation</b> of the saltstone slurry. However, the results of this testing showed there was no clear distinction between the densities of the cylinder sections for any of the transportation scenarios tested (1 day, 1 hour, and 0 minutes set time prefer to transportation). The bottom section of each cylinder was the densest for each transportation scenario, which indicates some settling in all the samples. Triplicate hydraulic conductivity measurements on samples from each set of time and transportation scenarios indicated that those samples transported immediately after pouring had the highest hydraulic conductivity. Conversely, samples that were allowed to sit for an hour before being transported had the lowest hydraulic conductivity. However, the hydraulic conductivities of all three samples fell within an acceptable range. Based on the cured property analysis of the three samples, there is no clear conclusion about transporting the samples before they are set; however, experience with saltstone grout indicates the samples should sit and develop some structure before being transported to SRNL for curing...|$|R
