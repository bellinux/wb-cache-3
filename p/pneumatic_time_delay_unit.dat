40|$|Abstract—A clock {{generation}} circuit having {{the function of}} multiphase locking was designed using the synchronous mirror delay (SMD) scheme. The internal clock can be synchronized to the external clock with intended phase difference. The synchro-nizing error of the clock {{generation circuit}} is reduced below the <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> of <b>unit</b> <b>delay</b> stage by compensation characteristics of detecting circuit in SMD. A 32 -M double data rate (DDR) SRAM including the clock generation circuit is fabricated using 0. 13 - m CMOS technology. To measure the synchronizing error of the clock generation circuit, the test elements group (TEG) system is designed and fabricated with the main system. The synchronizing error of the clock generation circuit is far smaller than the <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> of <b>unit</b> <b>delay</b> stage at zero phase locking and similar to the <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> of <b>unit</b> <b>delay</b> stage at multiphase locking.

40|$|Some {{applications}} {{require a}} highly-directive antenna array {{which has to}} scan the main beam over a limited-field-of-view (LFOV) angular sector. The phase control over the radiating aperture can be achieved with phase-shifters or <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> <b>units</b> (TDUs). Due to their cost and bulkiness <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> <b>units</b> can be hardly employed at element level and their number needs to be minimized as much as possible. On the other hand, the use of phase shifters may cause a beam squint or a narrow band operation if compared to employing TDUs. A quite common solution adopted to overcome the aforementioned issues for such radiating structures relies on the employment of time-delayed subarrays for reducing the costs and allowing an easier practical realization. The present work investigates on the possible performance improvements provided by arrays organized into randomly-overlapped subarrays with respect to other subarray arrangements such as contiguous and uniformly-overlapped lattices...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the first}} half of the twentieth century, a large {{interest}} has been addressed by the scientific and engineering community to the world of phased arrays antennas. Their technology started to be developed during the Second World War for early warning radar techniques to identify threats from the skies. Those capable antennas have been deployed over the years in a number of diversified fields to address different applications needs. First employed almost exclusively in the defense and space domains, nowadays the increased need for broadband connectivity in personal communications is leveraging their diffusion to the field of smart antennas for modern wireless communications. This thesis deals with a special way to fully exploit and further enhance the high flexibility of those complex yet very powerful type of antennas, mainly in terms of speed, compactness and cost. A number of fields have benefited the extremely low loss and broad bandwidth of optical communication technology. Especially interesting to us are the capabilities and extended possibilities brought to the world of microwave and antenna engineering by the use of optics and, specifically, of integrated photonics. This field is known as integrated microwave photonics. The huge bandwidth and extreme low loss of optical fibers can be harnessed to implement very capable signal processing circuits for high-frequency electrical signals. In particular, very broadband and continuosly tunable <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> <b>units</b> can be realized optically; those are of fundamental interest in a number of signal processing functionalities. Specifically, our interest in this work has been the design, realization, testing and integration in complex systems of novel beamformers that employ those delay lines, in conjunction with other components, to control the direction of radiation of a high-performance antenna array.

40|$|In {{order for}} stroke {{subjects}} to gain functional recovery of their hemiparetic limbs, facilitation {{techniques such as}} the repetitive facilitation exercise, or RFE, have been developed. Currently, {{there is a lack}} of understanding of the neural mechanisms associated with these types of facilitation techniques. To better understand the neural mechanisms associated with the RFE a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study should be conducted. This thesis presents experimental results testing the feasibility of implementing an fMRI-compatible actuator to facilitate a myotatic reflex in synchronization with the subject’s intention to move their hemiparetic limb. Preliminary data from a healthy individual demonstrated the feasibility of overlapping the long latency component of the afferent myotatic reflex, created by electrical stimulation, with descending nerve impulses, created using transcranial magnetic stimulation, in a time window of 15 ms. In addition, a <b>pneumatic</b> actuation <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> due to long transmission line was evaluated. The pneumatic actuator met the timing precision requirement for the rehabilitation device for varying transmission line lengths. Therefore a pneumatic actuation system was chosen for the rehabilitation device. This thesis will also presents on the design of an fMRI-compatible pneumatic actuator device to excite a stretch reflex response. Initial, experimental results with the device demonstrated that the designed pneumatic device can control the timing of the muscle response with a fixed signal within the required 15 ms window required for cortical facilitation, which was found in the previous feasibility study. However, the device was unable to create a long latency reflex observable at the muscle. Finally, this thesis presents on the capability of the device in creating subthreshold long latency response with precision to overlap with a subthreshold descending nerve impulse, created using transcranial magnetic stimulation. The overlap of the two responses was evaluated by comparing the amplitude of the muscle response with and without the stretch reflex, created by the fMRI-compatible pneumatic actuator device.

40|$|In {{the search}} for {{improved}} reproduction of a classical music performance, the technique of <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> compensation is {{shown to be a}} useful tool for balance in recording. This paper investigates the importance and validity of small time adjustments in recordings to compensate for variation in distance between spot microphones and a main stereo pair. Conventional recording techniques, psychoacoustic considerations and technological aspects of the use of delays are researched in order to determine their validity in timbral improvement. Multiple microphone set-ups are used to record both large orchestral works and smaller-scale classical compositions where auxiliary microphones may be needed to ensure an optimum balance in the final mix. Small <b>time</b> <b>delays</b> are derived from calculations involving the distances between microphones, the speed of sound, and humidity and temperature readings from the hall. Proper synchronization of these delays is desirable to preserve phase coherence and combat comb-filter effects. Precise <b>delay</b> <b>units</b> are used to compile musical exerpts for listening tests.

40|$|We {{conservatively}} extend an ACP-style discrete-time process {{theory with}} discrete stochastic delays. The semantics of the <b>timed</b> <b>delays</b> relies on <b>time</b> additivity and time determinism, which are properties that {{enable us to}} merge subsequent <b>timed</b> <b>delays</b> and to impose their synchronous expiration. Stochastic delays, however, interact {{with respect to a}} so-called race condition that determines the set of delays that expire first, which is guided by an (implicit) probabilistic choice. The race condition precludes the property of time additivity as the merger of stochastic delays alters this probabilistic behavior. To this end, we resolve the race condition using conditionally-distributed <b>unit</b> <b>delays.</b> We give a sound and ground-complete axiomatization of the process theory comprising the standard set of ACP-style operators. In this generalized setting, the alternative composition is no longer associative, so we have to resort to special normal forms that explicitly resolve the underlying race condition.

However, the ‘dissection’ of the stochastic <b>delays</b> to conditionally-distributed <b>unit</b> <b>delays</b> comes at a price, as we can no longer relate the resolved race condition to the original stochastic delays.
