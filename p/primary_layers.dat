State-of-the-art measurement techniques {{for the evaluation of}} <b>primary</b> <b>layer</b> homogeneity are very slow and can only be applied after the product is manufactured. We present here a method that enables on-line monitoring and control and is based on experimental modeling using neural networks. The experimental method is based on image acquisition and image processing of the mineral wool <b>primary</b> <b>layer</b> structure. As a estimator of the mineral wool <b>primary</b> <b>layer</b> structure and quality, the weight of the <b>primary</b> wool <b>layer</b> is used, measured by an on- line weighting device in four locations of the conveyor belt. The instrumentation of on- line weighting device was upgraded for {{the purpose of the present}} experiment and enabled high speed acquisition of all measurement channels. The structure of the mineral wool <b>primary</b> <b>layer</b> was measured by visualization of the modified entrance to the on- line balance using a CCD camera.

40|$|International audienceFiber-reinforced polymer {{composites}} (CFRP) {{are increasingly}} used in aerospace for weight-sensitive applications. However, they {{are subjected to}} degradation from the erosive forces of solid particles and water droplets. This degradation results in a decreased service life of composite components and increased repair costs. A coating can protect the CFRP surface against wear and plasma spraying could be a candidate technique to achieve this coating. However, an issue is the thermal and mechanical damage to the composite surface by the plasma- sprayed particles. Another issue is the coating adhesion, because of the low wettability of polymer surface to liquid metal and ceramic and different atomistic properties between substrate and coating material.

It has been shown that Hox genes and other developmental genes such as DLX are important for patterning the anterior/posterior and dorsal/ventral axes of the branchial arches.

In the conclusion both platforms are evaluated and compared according to the result values of all criteria. The thesis is divided into two parts. The theoretical part deals with the analysis and definition of criteria and the BI platform introduction. Used criteria are analyzed in the Gartner research, in the book about business intelligence and in two diploma theses. Own defined criteria are divided into following groups: Installation, ETL, OLAP, Reporting and Documentation. The introduction includes description of components, licence politics and available editions. In the practical part the platform functionality is tested, the project created in both of them is specified and then platforms are evaluated and compared. The functionality testing is made progressively from installation, through ETL and OLAP to reporting.

This secondary layer spontaneously displays complex chaotic dynamics. All connections have a constant time delay. We use for our experiments a Hebbian (covariance) learning rule. This rule slowly modifies the weights {{under the influence of}} a periodic stimulus. The effect of learning is twofold: (i) it simplifies the secondary-layer dynamics, which eventually stabilizes to a periodic orbit; and (ii) it connects the secondary <b>layer</b> to the <b>primary</b> <b>layer,</b> and realizes a feedback from the secondary to the primar...|$|R

Many compounds form nanowires following the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) growth mechanism, {{and the growth of}} Bi 2 Te 3 nanobelts was also explained following the VLS route. Here, we present another growth mechanism of Bi 2 Te 3 nano- and sub-micron belts and ribbons. The samples were grown by physical vapor transport from Bi 2 Te 3 precursor using TiO 2 nanoparticles as catalyst, and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy. The growth starts from a Te-rich cluster, and proceeds via a thin, tip-catalyzed <b>primary</b> <b>layer</b> growing in the [110] direction. The <b>primary</b> <b>layer</b> serves as a support for subsequent step-flow growth. The precursor predominantly absorbs on the substrate and reaches the belt by migration from the base to the tip.

We measured the texture and phase distribution of the biocomposites of Magasella sanguinica, Lingula anatina 1, Mergerlia truncata, Sepia officinalis, and synthetically grown calcite crystals from silica gels. Our major aim was to see the relation of the texture to the curvature of the shells in a quantitative manner which we could previously show qualitatively with electron back scattering diffraction e. g. for Mergerlia truncata [1].

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model describing the steady-state solidification of ternary systems with mushy layers (primary and cotectic) is formulated: solidification along a liquidus surface {{is characterized by}} a primary mushy layer, and solidification along a cotectic line {{is characterized by a}} secondary (cotectic) mushy layer. Exact analytical solutions of the model under consideration are found in a parametric form (thicknesses of mushy layers, growth rate of their boundaries, temperature and composition fields, solid fractions are determined in an explicit form). The velocity of solidification is completely determined by temperature gradients in the solid and liquid phases. This velocity coincides with similar expressions describing binary melt solidification with a planar front or a mushy layer. It is shown that the liquid composition of the main component decreases in the cotectic and <b>primary</b> <b>layers,</b> whereas the second (cotectic) composition increases in the cotectic layer, attains a maximum point and decreases in the primary layer. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Skin {{aging is}} the result of {{intrinsic}} chronological aging and photoaging, due to UV exposure, that both share important histological modifications and molecular features, including alterations of proteins. One of the main damage is glycation that occurs when reducing sugars react non-enzymatically with proteins. This reaction also happens when the dicarbonyl compounds GO (glyoxal) and MG (methylglyoxal), which are glucose derivatives, react with proteins. These compounds can be detoxified by the glyoxalase system composed of two enzymes, Glo 1 (glyoxalase I) and Glo 2 (glyoxalase II).

The main advantages of SNN are the temporal plasticity, ease of use in neural interface circuits and reduced computation complexity. SNN have been successfully used for image classification.

Different spiking neuron mathematical models exist, but their computational complexity makes them ill-suited for hardware implementation. In this paper, a novel, simplified and computationally efficient model of spike response model (SRM) neuron with spike-time dependent plasticity (STDP) learning is presented. Frequency spike coding based on receptive fields is used for data representation; images are encoded by the network and processed in a similar manner as the <b>primary</b> <b>layers</b> in visual cortex.

In thin section, a variation between the upper and lower portions of the secondary layer is evident. The concentrations of magnesium, sulphur and strontium are significantly greater in the <b>primary</b> <b>layer</b> of the shell. Magnesium concentration also differs between the upper and lower regions of the secondary layer with higher concentration in the upper portion of the secondary layer. The shell of N. anomala consists of two layers; a <b>primary</b> <b>layer</b> of acicular calcite and a secondary layer of calcite semi-nacre. N. anomala has a high magnesium calcite shell. The concentration of minor elements does not differ significantly between the <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>layers.</b> Two calcium carbonate polymorphs occur in the M. edulis shell with an outer calcite layer and an inner aragonite layer. Magnesium concentration is higher in the calcite layer while strontium concentrations are greater in the aragonite layer. Sodium concentration gradually decreases across the calcite layer from the outer surface to the calcite/aragonite boundary and increases in the aragonite layer.

5000|$|A {{very young}} anther {{consists}} of actively dividing meristematic cells {{surrounded by a}} layer of epidermis. It then becomes two-lobed. Each anther lobe develops two pollen sacs. Thus, a two-lobed anther develops four pollen sacs situated at {{four corners of the}} anther.Development of pollen sacs begins with the differentiation of archesporial cells in the hypodermal region below epidermis at four corners of the young anther. The archesporial cells divide by periclinal division to give a subepidermal <b>primary</b> parietal <b>layer</b> and a <b>primary</b> sporogenous <b>layer.</b> The cells of the <b>primary</b> parietal <b>layer</b> divide by successive periclinal and anticlinal divisions to form concentric layers of pollen sac wall. The wall layers from periphery to centre consist of: ...|$|R
