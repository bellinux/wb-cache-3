This work was motivated by, and applied to, the mechanical acquisition or inference of operator precedence grammars. A new normal form of operator <b>precedence</b> grammars <b>called</b> homogeneous is defined. An algorithm is given to construct a grammar, called max-grammar, generating the largest language which is compatible with a given precedence matrix.

Exploiting the lower bound and the mathematical formulation proposed in Bianco and Caramia (4 OR 9 (4) : 371 – 389 2011) for the RCPSP with FP, in this paper we propose an exact algorithm based on branch and bound rules.

50|$|In {{terms of}} graph theory, any {{syntactic}} tree or connected subgraph {{of a tree}} is a catena. In this regard, every constituent is a catena, {{but there are many}} catenae that are not constituents. The constituent is therefore a subtype of catena. Any individual element (word or morph) or combination of elements linked together in the vertical dimension is a catena. Sentence structure is conceived of as existing in two dimensions. Combinations organized along the horizontal dimension (in terms of <b>precedence)</b> are <b>called</b> strings, whereas combinations organized along the vertical dimension (in terms of dominance) are catenae. In terms of a cartesian coordinate system, strings exist along the x-axis, and catenae along the y-axis.|$|R

They have developed a weakly polynomial algorithm for a particular class of linear <b>precedence</b> graphs <b>called</b> unitary graphs, which generalizes the usual not-earlier precedence relations between the tasks. The purpose of this note is two-fold. First, we suggest a further generalization of the unitary relations that extends the usual not-later precedence relations; as a result, the arc lengths and heights in the underlying graph may be negative. Second, we show that, as soon as the arc heights in the graph are computed, an optimum periodic schedule can be found in strongly polynomial time...|$|R

40|$|There are two {{approaches}} to reasoning about distributed algorithms. In the operational approach, one reasons "dynamically" {{about the events}} that can occur and the temporal <b>precedence</b> relation (<b>called</b> causality) between those events. In the assertional approach, one reasons "statically" about reachable states by means of assertions (called invariants) that are true for all reachable states. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to show that the operational and assertional approaches can be combined in such a way that the advantages of both approaches are attained. On the one hand, operational reasoning about events and causality affords an intuitive way to think about and understand distributed algorithms. On the other hand, assertional proof techniques allow such intuitive understanding to be used to guide and structure formal correctness proofs. By combining these {{two approaches}}, the difficult task of verifying distributed algorithms is made easier. It is also shown that the notio [...] ...|$|R

30|$|Integration of {{production}} planning and scheduling is {{a class of}} problems commonly found in manufacturing industry. One of the important constraints in the integration {{of production}} planning and scheduling is a so <b>called</b> <b>precedence</b> constraint.

Hard precedence constraint is a constraint that makes the solution infeasible if violated; while, soft precedence constraint imposes a penalty only and the solution is still feasible. In this article, the production planning and scheduling problems, associated with both hard and soft precedence constraints, are considered.|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} the computation of periodic cyclic schedules for linear precedence constraints graphs: a linear precedence constraint is defined between two tasks and induces an infinite set of usual precedence constraints between their executions {{such that the}} difference of iterations is a linear function. The objective function is the minimization of the maximal period of a task. We recall first that this problem may be modelled using linear programming. A polynomial algorithm is then developed to solve it for a particular class of linear <b>precedence</b> graphs <b>called</b> unitary graphs. We also show that a periodic schedule may not exist for unitary graphs. In the general case, a decomposition of the linear precedence graph into unitary components is computed and we assume that a periodic schedule exists {{for each of these}} components. Lower bounds on the periods are exhibited and we show that an optimal periodic schedule may not achieve them. The notion of quasi-periodic schedule is then introduced and we prove that this new class of schedules always reaches these bounds...|$|R

40|$|We {{characterize}} the polysemic interval pairs [...] -pairs of posets that admit simultaneous interval and interval-containment representations [...] -and present algorithms to recognize them and construct polysemic interval representations. 1 Introduction The set I of intervals {{on the real}} line admits two natural orderings. One is the left-to-right relationship between disjoint intervals, which we <b>call</b> <b>precedence.</b> The other is containment. Any two intervals that are related by neither precedence nor containment must overlap one another. There is a substantial literature {{on each of these}} three relations, and on the connections between them. Interval precedence gives rise to a class of partial orders called the interval orders.

40|$|In the literature, {{there exist}} several models where a {{cooperative}} TU-game is enriched with a hierarchical structure on the player set that {{is represented by}} a digraph. We consider games under precedence constraints introduced by Faigle and Kern (1992) who also introduce a generalization of the Shapley value for such games. They characterized this solution by efficiency, linearity, the null player property and hierarchical strength which states that in unanimity games the payoffs are allocated among {{the players in the}} unanimity coalition proportional to their hierarchical strength in the corresponding coalition. The hierarchical strength of a player in a coalition in an acyclic digraph is the number of admissible permutations (those in which successors in the digraph enter before predecessors) where this player is the last of that coalition to enter. We introduce and axiomatize a new solution for games under <b>precedence</b> constraints, <b>called</b> hierarchical solution. Unlike the precedence Shapley value, this new solution satisfies the desirable axiom of irrelevant player independence meaning that payoffs assigned to relevant players are not affected by the presence of irrelevant players. This hierarchical solution is defined in a similar spirit as the precedence Shapley value but is a precedence power solution, and thus allocates the dividend of a coalition proportionally to a power measure for acyclic digraphs, specifically proportionally to the hierarchical measure. We give an axiomatization of this measure and extend it to regular set systems. Finally, we consider the normalized hierarchical measure on the subclasses of forests and sink...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Within the {{framework}} of Witsenhausen’s intrinsic model for discrete stochastic control, we provide a unified framework to extend and study three binary relations between agents: the so <b>called</b> <b>precedence,</b> subsystem and memory-communication relations. These are tools to analyze nonsequential systems, those for which, in contrast to sequential ones, any a priori ordering of control actions is impossible independently of the set of control laws. We give localized versions of these relations are given; localizing the precedence relation provides an evocative characterization of Witsenhausen’s causality property (C). Connections between these three binary relations are exhibited. We show in particular that the subsystem relation is the reflexive and transitive closure of the precedence relation. We give new characterizations of sequentiality, and introduce systems closed under precedence, as well as partially nested systems. We prove that partially nested systems without self information (causal ones in particular) are sequential. We {{end up with a}} summary table providing a classification of information structures in terms of binary relations. Key words.

40|$|Abst ract [...] In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{versatile}} scheduling discipline, <b>called</b> <b>Precedence</b> with Partial Push-out (PPP), in Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) switches supporting two delay and two loss priorities. By employing a threshold L, the PPP discipline provides delay guarantee by allowing a newly-arriving high-delay-priority cell to precede {{a maximum of}} L, low-delay-priority cells. Through the use of another threshold R, the discipline offers loss guarantee by permitting a newly-arriving high-loss-priority cell to push out the last low-loss-priority cell located beyond the R th location in a full queue. By setting L and R properly, PPP versatilely performs as {{any one of the}} four widely-accepted disciplines, namely, the FCFS, head-of-line, push-out, or head-of-line with push-out disciplines. For precisely determining L and R retaining demanded Quality of Services (QoSs), we provide an in-depth queueing analysis for the Cell Delay (CD) and Cell Loss Ratio (CLR) of high-delay-priority, low-loss-priority cells. We further propose asimple, algebra-bused analysis for the CD and CLR of low-delay-priority, high-loss-priority cells. On the basis of these analyses, L and R can be dynamically and effectively adjusted to provide adequate delay and loss guarantees for high-priority cells while incurring only minimal performance d gradation for other classes of cells. Finally, the paper presents simulation results confirming the accuracy of the analyses...|$|R
