5|$|In an {{interview}} with Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap, Chambers revealed he would depart the serial {{at the conclusion of}} his contract in late 2017 due to a <b>prior</b> <b>commitment.</b> He explained that he would be touring with a musical, which disappointed show bosses, but would return to the show {{at the conclusion of the}} tour.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to foreign dignitaries, the President's Guest House {{has traditionally been}} made available by the outgoing President of the United States to the President-elect in the five days prior to his inauguration. In 1992, Bill Clinton chose {{to stay at the}} Hay–Adams Hotel instead of the guest house and, in 2009, a request by President-elect Barack Obama to take-up residence at the President's Guest House two weeks early was rejected because of its <b>prior</b> <b>commitment</b> to former Australian prime minister John Howard.|$|E
5|$|The delay {{caused the}} entire {{production}} schedule to be revised, and cinematographer Carlo Carlini, {{who had a}} <b>prior</b> <b>commitment,</b> had {{to be replaced by}} Otello Martelli, a long-time favorite of Fellini's. When filming resumed in February 1954, it was winter. The temperature had dropped to -5°C, often resulting in no heat or hot water, necessitating more delays and forcing the cast and crew to sleep fully dressed and wear hats to keep warm.|$|E

5|$|In December 2013, Marvel {{confirmed}} that Drew Goddard {{would be the}} executive producer and showrunner for Daredevil, and would write and direct the first episode, though {{at the end of}} May 2014, it was announced that Goddard would no longer be the showrunner for the series, being replaced by Steven S. DeKnight. Goddard, who wrote the first two episodes, remained with the show as an executive producer. It was also revealed that the series would be titled Marvel's Daredevil. A few days later, Charlie Cox was cast as Daredevil. A second season was ordered on April 21, 2015, with Doug Petrie and Marco Ramirez taking over as showrunners from DeKnight, who could not return to the series due to a <b>prior</b> <b>commitment.</b> A third season was ordered in July 2016, with Erik Oleson announced as the new showrunner of the series in October 2017.|$|E
5|$|Huskisson's coffin {{was placed}} on a trestle table in the Town Hall, draped with black velvet and covered with {{feathered}} plumes. Between 9.00 and 10.00am a stream of mourners were guided to the coffin {{by a group of}} truncheon men. At 10.00 two mutes guided the mourners out of the town hall and mounted horses; the rain and hail had by now eased. The mutes led the procession, followed by the mourners from the town hall and around 1,100 other mourners who had waited outside. These mourners marched six abreast, and were followed by the funeral committee, 28 local clergymen and two more mutes. Behind this group marched Joseph Brandreth and the Rev Blackburne, and behind them came carriages carrying the pall-bearers, a group of local dignitaries who had known and worked with Huskisson, followed by two more mutes. Behind this pair of mutes was a hearse carrying the coffin, followed by Huskisson's colleagues and his surviving brothers Thomas and Samuel. These in turn were followed by around 900 locals in mourning dress who had decided to join the procession, bringing the cortège to around half a mile (0.8km) in length. The Duke of Wellington, pleading a <b>prior</b> <b>commitment</b> to attend a dinner in Birmingham, did not attend.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} ran so {{late that}} both Almendros and camera operator John Bailey {{had to leave}} due to a <b>prior</b> <b>commitment</b> on François Truffaut's The Man Who Loved Women (1977). Almendros approached cinematographer Haskell Wexler to complete the film. They worked together for a week so that Wexler could get familiar with the film's visual style.|$|E

25|$|The {{first major}} area of social {{influence}} is conformity. Conformity {{is defined as}} the tendency to act or think like other members of a group. The identity of members within a group, i.e. status, similarity, expertise, as well as cohesion, <b>prior</b> <b>commitment,</b> and accountability to the group help to determine the level of conformity of an individual. Individual variation among group members {{plays a key role in}} the dynamic of how willing people will be to conform. Conformity is usually viewed as a negative tendency in American culture, but a certain amount of conformity is adaptive in some situations, as is nonconformity in other situations.|$|E
25|$|In early 1991, Knopfler and Illsley resurrected Dire Straits, {{bringing}} back with them former keyboardists Alan Clark, and Guy Fletcher. Retaining Bicknell as their manager, Dire Straits was trimmed down and comprised only four members once again. The band began recording tracks {{for a new}} album, integrating new session players who included steel guitarist Paul Franklin, and percussionist Danny Cummings. Saxophonist Chris White returned, and guitarist Phil Palmer filled the vacancy left by Sonni. During the recording sessions, American drummer Jeff Porcaro performed in place of Williams. Afterwards, {{he was invited to}} join the band full-time but declined because of a <b>prior</b> <b>commitment</b> to Toto.|$|E

25|$|Webern's music, {{like that}} of both Brahms and Schoenberg, is marked by its {{emphasis}} on counterpoint and formal considerations; and Webern's commitment to systematic pitch organization in the twelve-tone method is inseparable from this <b>prior</b> <b>commitment.</b> Webern's tone rows are often arranged {{to take advantage of}} internal symmetries; for example, a twelve-tone row may be divisible into four groups of three pitches which are variations, such as inversions and retrogrades, of each other, thus creating invariance. This gives Webern's work considerable motivic unity, although this is often obscured by the fragmentation of the melodic lines. This fragmentation occurs through octave displacement (using intervals greater than an octave) and by moving the line rapidly from instrument to instrument in a technique referred to as Klangfarbenmelodie.|$|E
25|$|The federal government's goal of commercializing {{the bison}} {{throughout}} Canada undermined {{the need to}} provide inexpensive bison meat to the local population in northern Canada. With new agreements with meatpackers in the south, combined with their <b>prior</b> <b>commitment</b> to the Hudson's Bay Company and Indian Affairs, over nine hundred bison were slaughtered. Through the agreement, the packing companies received top quality bison meat for low prices, while northern Canada got tough meat that was sold at higher prices. CWS biologists feared that there was no scientific legitimacy to the slaughtering of the nine hundred bison, many which did not have tuberculosis. In the winter of 1957- 1958, the testing and slaughtering program of the bison was established. The conservation and commodification of bison are fundamentally contradictory goals.|$|E
500|$|Jonah Hill as Franklin, a {{resident}} with emotional problems who joins the watch after being {{rejected by the}} local police force; Hill's involvement was confirmed in August 2011. His <b>prior</b> <b>commitment</b> to The Watch forced him to decline a role in Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained, which he had considered [...] "the perfect next step" [...] following his 2011 Academy Award nomination. However, he later secured {{a role in the}} film. Hill spent two weeks learning to use a balisong knife for his character.|$|E

500|$|In July 1990, {{after the}} fall of the Eastern Bloc and {{political}} upheaval in Albania itself, Alia announced the restoration of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. In an official communiqué the Soviets [...] "attributed the normalisation [...] to the better political climate in Europe, and the state radio reported that, as the Soviet Union was on course for reform, 'there has been a marked trend recently towards democratisation of Albanian society'." [...] In June 1991 the ruling Party of Labour became the social-democratic Socialist Party, dropping its <b>prior</b> <b>commitment</b> to Marxism–Leninism, and in December 1991 the Soviet Union was dissolved.|$|E
500|$|Jonah Hill {{was offered}} the role of Scotty Harmony, a gambler who loses [...] to Candie in a poker game, but turned it down due to {{scheduling}} conflicts with The Watch. Sacha Baron Cohen was also offered the role, but declined in order to appear in Les Misérables. Neither Scotty nor the poker game appear in the final cut of the film. Hill later appeared in the film in a different role. Joseph Gordon-Levitt said that he [...] "would have loved, loved to have" [...] been in the film but {{would be unable to}} appear because of a <b>prior</b> <b>commitment</b> to direct his first film, Don Jon.|$|E
500|$|The god Krishna, {{who is a}} {{close friend}} of and advisor to the Pandavas, hears of Duryodhana's plan, and devises one of his own, to ensure that Aravan will give himself as a {{sacrifice}} on behalf of the Pandavas rather than the Kauravas. [...] Krishna first discusses the issue with Yudhishthira (Dharma or Dharmaraja), the eldest of the Pandavas, recommending the sacrifice to Kali as a part of an ayudha-puja ("worship of the weapons"). Krishna establishes that there are four candidates most suited to being offered as the victim: Shalya, who {{is on the side of}} Kauravas; Arjuna, the commander of the Pandavas; Aravan; and Krishna himself. From this shortlist, Krishna finally narrows the best choice down to Aravan. Aravan agrees to undergo the kalappali on behalf of the Pandavas but mentions his <b>prior</b> <b>commitment</b> to Duryodhana.|$|E

500|$|After four busy {{weeks the}} Mozarts {{departed}} for Naples. Travellers {{on the route}} through the Pontine Marshes were frequently harassed by brigands, so Leopold arranged a convoy of four coaches. They arrived on 14 May. Armed with their letters of recommendation, the Mozarts were soon calling on the prime minister, marchese Bernardo Tanucci, and William Hamilton, the British ambassador, whom they knew from London. They gave a concert on 28May, which brought in about 750 florins (Leopold would not reveal the exact amount), and attended the first performance of Niccolò Jommelli's opera Armida abbandonata at the Teatro di San Carlo. Wolfgang was impressed by both {{the music and the}} performance, though he felt it [...] "too old-fashioned and serious for the theatre". Invited to write an opera for the next San Carlo season, he declined because of his <b>prior</b> <b>commitment</b> to Milan. When no summons to play at the royal court was forthcoming, Leopold eventually decided to leave Naples, after visits to Vesuvius, Herculaneum, Pompeii, and the Roman baths at Baiae. They departed by post-coach for Rome on 25June.|$|E
500|$|For {{the role}} of Kancha, the antagonist, Sanjay Dutt was cast. According to Malhotra, the script of Agneepath demanded that the villain be more {{powerful}} than the hero, and due to Dutt's bulky frame, he was considered perfect for the role. The character of Kancha demanded that Dutt go bald, but due to a <b>prior</b> <b>commitment</b> to the film Son of Sardar, which was being shot simultaneously, he could not do so for the sake of continuity. Therefore, Hollywood make up artist Robin Slater created a [...] "bald" [...] look for Dutt, with the use of prosthetics. However, due to the summer heat in Diu, the make-up would eventually drip down Dutt's face, which impelled him to finally shave his head. Director Malhotra admitted to being inspired by Marlon Brando's bald look in the film Apocalypse Now (1979) while designing Dutt's character. Dutt explained his look by saying, [...] "Kancha is suffering from an ailment that leaves him hairless. I shaved my head for the role, not once but twice, and the eye-brows and eye-lashes have been digitally removed." [...] Furthermore, Dutt worked out in the gym twice a day in order to bulk up for the role.|$|E
500|$|Sonam Gyatso, {{after being}} granted the grandiose title by Altan Khan, {{departed}} for Tibet. Before he left, {{he sent a}} letter and gifts to the Ming Chinese official Zhang Juzheng (1525–1582), which arrived on March 12, 1579. Sometime in August or September of that year, Sonam Gyatso's representative stationed with Altan Khan received a return letter and gift from the Wanli Emperor (r.1572–1620), who also conferred upon Sonam Gyatso a title; {{this was the first}} official contact between a Dalai Lama and a government of China. However, Laird states that when Wanli invited him to Beijing, the Dalai Lama declined the offer due to a <b>prior</b> <b>commitment,</b> even though he was only [...] from Beijing. Laird adds that [...] "the power of the Ming emperor did not reach very far at the time." [...] Although not recorded in any official Chinese records, Sonam Gyatso's biography states that Wanli again conferred titles on Sonam Gyatso in 1588, and invited him to Beijing for a second time, but Sonam Gyatso was unable to visit China as he died the same year in Mongolia working with Altan Khan's son to further the spread of Buddhism.|$|E
