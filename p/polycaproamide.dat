The {{aim is to}} study the strain behaviour of the crystallites and amorphous sections in the oriented crystallizing polymers in {{the conditions of the}} heat action. It has been shown that at plastic deformation of the oriented systems the crystallite can be subjected to the reversible and non-reversible deformation by means of the re-orientation; the conception that the shear deformation of the crystallites can make the perceptible contribution into the shear deformation of the sample has been developed.

40|$|The {{object of}} investigation: the anione polyamides, {{obtained}} {{in the presence of}} the polyfunctional activators on the base of the N-acryloilcaprolactam. The purpose of the work: the synthesis of the new polyfunctional activators on the base of the N-acryloilcaprolactam and the investigation of its influence on the structure and physico-mechanical polyamides. The new sewn activators of the anione polymerization of the lactams have been synthesized. In its presence the completely sewn polyamides, of specific impact viscousity to 34 kJ/m* 992 by Isod and the field of the high elasticity at the temperatures above 220 degrees, have been obtained. Developed and protected by the Authorised Certificates have been the method of obtaining of N-acryloilprolactam, the method of obtaining of the sewn <b>polycaproamide.</b> The field of application: the construction impact-strength polyamidesAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{aluminium}} (99, 99 %) and its alloys with Mg, Cu, Sn, Zn, Y, Si (lesser than 5 % of masses), alloys with Sn, Pb, Cd (10 - 40 % of masses) in the non-aqueous dimethylforamide and <b>polycaproamide</b> electrolytes {{have been}} investigated. The {{aim is to}} study the kinetics and phase formation on the initial phases of formation. It has been determined that the alloying of Al with the small additions of Mg, Si, Cu forming the solid solution on base of the aluminium makes difficult the introduction process on all its stages without formation of the lithium-containing phases on base of the alloying component. The Sn additions which are present as {{the inclusion of the}} individual phase sorb the lithium and simplifies the formation of the LiAl intermetallic nuclei. The new model for design of the specific number and critical radius of the LiAl nuclei depending on the potential and substrate nature has been proposedAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E

The effect of the transcritical bifurcation of the gravitationally bend jet has been investigated. The influence of the jet configuration and the forces of the own weight on "the resonance with the extension" has been investigated.

40|$|Thepolycaproamide PA 6 {{films were}} {{modified}} {{with layers of}} thallium selenide, TlxSey. A two stage process was used to deposit these thinlayers involves: seleniumization in 0. 05 mol·dm– 3 K 2 SeS 2 O 6 solution of 0. 1 mol·dm– 3 HCl and 60  oCfollowed by treatment with the solution ofTl 2 SO 4 at 80  °C for 10  min. The atomic absorption spectroscopy and XRD analysis for investigation the layers of TlxSey were used. The amount of selenium and thallium in the layers of TlxSey increases with increasing theduration of polymer seleniumization and varies: thallium from ~ 9. 0 to ~ 21. 4 mg·g- 1 and selenium from ~ 17. 7 to ~ 56. 9 mg·g- 1. The results of XRD analysisconfirmed the formation of thallium selenide layers {{on the surface of}} <b>polycaproamide</b> 6 films. Three phases of tetragonal thallium selenide, Tl 2 Se 2 (75 – 880), Tl 2 Se 1. 2 (75 – 1007), Tl 5 Se 3 (41 – 1295) and two phases of monoclinicselenium Se 8 (71 – 528), Se (73 – 2121) wereidentified. The phase composition oflayers of TlxSe changesdepending on the duration of polymer seleniumization process. DOI: [URL] </p...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} the author's technique {{and experience in}} the treatment of the flaccid "unhappy buttock" form with his surgical procedure of buttock lift by suture, without incision scars. The author first presented this new operation technique on a national level at the 2 nd Annual Meeting of the National Bulgarian Society for Aesthetic Surgery and Aesthetic Medicine in Sofia on March 18, 1994 [1] and internationally at many scientific meetings over the world [2, 3, 4 …]. The result is a visual change in the buttock position to a higher one, which elongates the lower limbs and changes the proportions between lower and upper half of the body. The aim {{of this study is to}} describe a mini-invasive procedure of beautification of the buttock form without scars by creating a lifting effect on the buttock's subcutaneous tissue, using a suture that takes the inferiorly positioned deep fibrose tissue and fixes it upwards to the sacro-cutaneous fascia, discovered by the author. Aesthetic and technical considerations required properly sculpting the buttocks into a higher position, demonstrating nicely rounded form. Preoperative shape is discussed and patient evaluations, operative techniques, postoperative management and results after 4 years of experience are emphasized. 1032 female patients, and 26 male patients aged 18 - 62 years, with ptosis and cellulite on the buttocks were treated since 1993 on an outpatient basis by the "Serdev suture technique without visible scars". Important instrumentarium is a long, curved, elastic needle and Polycon semi-elastic Bulgarian antimicrobial <b>polycaproamide</b> long term (in 2 years) absorbable surgical threads Polycon, produced in Bulgaria. This operation has been performed either alone or after ultrasonic assisted liposculpture (UAL) that reduces the amount of fat and heaviness. All patients reported a high degree of satisfaction. A stable improvement in the buttock position and form was observed for the period described. In the postoperative period the complication rate was minimal and resolved in the first 4 - 5 days post operative period. The skin puncture in the perianal zone makes antibiotic prophylaxis obligatory as well as a strict follow up for the first 7 days. Some pain in the sitting position was observed for at least 5 to 10 days, but all other social and professional duties and activities were possible. This outpatient procedure is effective in the correction of buttock laxity and ptosis and creates a new form, universally accepted as "happy buttocks". </p...|$|E
