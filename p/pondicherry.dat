5|$|The Future Poetry, <b>Pondicherry,</b> India: Sri Aurobindo Ashram, 1953.|$|E
5|$|An {{international}} conference that the Government of <b>Pondicherry</b> and the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs held in October 2004 decided {{to investigate the}} Arikamedu site jointly for conservation, as its ancient commercial link with the Romans has been established. During this conference, the Government of <b>Pondicherry</b> also decided to propose the site for status as a World Heritage Site of UNESCO. The Archaeological Survey of India also proposed the site for UNESCO Cultural Heritage Site status, under the title Silk Road Sites in India.|$|E
5|$|Harmless to humans, the <b>Pondicherry</b> shark {{was caught}} {{and used for}} meat. Fewer than 20 {{specimens}} have been deposited in museum collections, {{most of which were}} collected prior to 1900. This shark's rarity originally led to fears that it may be possibly extinct. However, in 2016, the <b>Pondicherry</b> shark was rediscovered in the Sri Lankan Menik and Kumbukkam rivers. Two photographs of this species exist; one taken from above by a group of nature enthusiasists, as well as one taken from the side by a freshwater fish survey. Given that artisanal and commercial fishing activity across its range is heavy, unregulated, and intensifying, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed the <b>Pondicherry</b> shark as Critically Endangered and placed a high priority on locating any surviving populations.|$|E
5|$|In 1862, Theodore Gill {{elevated}} Hypoprion to {{the rank}} of full genus and also placed the <b>Pondicherry</b> shark in its own genus, Hypoprionodon, based on the relative positions of the dorsal and pectoral fins. Subsequent authors generally accepted Gill's first revision but not his second, and thus this species became known as Hypoprion hemiodon. In 1985, Jack Garrick followed up on earlier taxonomic work by Leonard Compagno and synonymized Hypoprion with Carcharhinus. Another common name for the <b>Pondicherry</b> shark is long nosed shark.|$|E
5|$|Some analysts {{remarked that}} Indonesia's delayed action also {{prevented}} peaceful transfer of East Timor to it, {{similar to the}} manner in which the French transferred <b>Pondicherry</b> to India in 1962.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Pondicherry</b> shark {{appears to}} have been broadly {{distributed}} in the Indo-Pacific. It may have once been common, as it was reportedly a regular catch off India and Pakistan, but is now extremely rare. Most of the known specimens were collected from India, with more specimens from the Gulf of Oman, Borneo, and Java. There are also less reliable records from the South China Sea, other parts of Southeast Asia such as Vietnam and the Philippines, New Guinea, and northern Australia. This species inhabits inshore waters. Several older sources reported that it could be found in rivers such as the Hooghli River and the Saigon River. These reports may have confused a river shark (Glyphis sp.) for the <b>Pondicherry</b> shark; if accurate, they would suggest this species to be tolerant of low salinity. As of 2016, these reports have been confirmed; the only documented <b>Pondicherry</b> sharks in the 21st century were found in the Sri Lankan Menik River.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 89 ports are {{situated}} along the coast: Tamil Nadu (15), Karnataka (10), Kerala (17), Andhra Pradesh (12), Lakshadweep (10), <b>Pondicherry</b> (2) and Andaman & Nicobar (23). Major ports include Chennai, Visakhapatnam, Mangalore, Tuticorin, Ennore and Kochi.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} eleven sets were created {{for all of}} the filming schedules. Filming also took place in Chengalpattu, Tiruvannamalai and <b>Pondicherry.</b> Spoofs on Sivaji Ganesan, M. G. Ramachandran and Avvaiyar are seen in the film. Wipes and split screen {{transitions}} are commonly used. Principal photography was completed in 5561 days.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of his stay at <b>Pondicherry,</b> there were few followers, but with time their numbers grew, resulting {{in the formation of the}} Sri Aurobindo Ashram in 1926. From 1926 he started to sign himself as Sri Aurobindo, Sri (meaning holy in Sanskrit) being commonly used as an honorific.|$|E
5|$|News of the French {{declaration}} of war arrived by ship in Calcutta, having traveled from George Baldwin, British ambassador in Alexandria, on 1 June 1793. Cornwallis immediately sailed to <b>Pondicherry,</b> instituting a blockade and seizing an ammunition supply ship entering the port. Plans to eliminate the French presence in India had already been drawn up. The British and EIC forces, commanded on land by Colonel John Braithwaite, moved rapidly, seizing Chandernagore, Karaikal, Yanam and Mahé without resistance. <b>Pondicherry</b> proved stronger, and Braithwaite was forced to besiege the city for 22 days until the French commander, Colonel Prosper de Clermont, agreed to surrender. Cornwallis's blockade was augmented by several large East Indiamen, proving sufficient {{as a deterrent to}} drive off the French frigate Cybèle and accompanying storeships which sought to resupply the garrison on 14 August.|$|E
5|$|On 3 March 1789, {{he enlisted}} as a {{volunteer}} on the 700-ton Aurore, under Captain Tardivet, a slave ship bound for India. Aurore sailed to <b>Pondicherry</b> and ferried troops bound for Isle de France. On her next journey, seeking to purchase slaves on the Horn of Africa, Aurore was wrecked in Mozambique Channel, drowning 400 black slaves chained in the orlop. Tardivet chartered the Portugues San Antoine in October 1790 to return to Port-Louis, but had to divert to Sumatra because of the weather, and only returned to Port-Louis in late 1790, on a French ship via the French colony of <b>Pondicherry.</b> Promoted to officer, Surcouf enlisted on the Courrier d'Afrique, another slave ship, bound for Mozambique under Captain Garnier. Captain Tardivet then brought him over as Lieutenant on his new ship, Revanche. On Revanche, Surcouf made several expeditions off Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|On land, {{the army}} at Madras was {{placed under the}} command of Colonel John Braithwaite. After {{assembling}} his forces at Wallyabad, Braithwaite marched on <b>Pondicherry,</b> occupying Villenore to the southwest and Arian Coupang to the south, cutting off the garrison from the supporting hinterland of the city. On 28 July, Braithwaite reached the city and established positions on the Red Hill overlooking <b>Pondicherry,</b> sending a demand to its commander Colonel Prosper de Clement that he surrender. The demand was refused, and Braithwaite ordered detachments from the 71st and 74th Regiments of Foot to occupy positions to the south of the city's walls on 30 July, a manoeuvre which prompted heavy fire from the bastions. This move was however a feint, Braithwaite planned to launch his main assault on the northeast corner where the defences were weaker and the ground drier.|$|E
5|$|The Siege of <b>Pondicherry</b> was {{a colonial}} {{military}} {{operation in the}} early stages of the French Revolutionary Wars. Britain and France both controlled colonies on the Indian Subcontinent and when the French National Convention declared war on Britain on 1 February 1793, both sides were prepared for conflict in India. British India was centred on the principal ports of Bombay, Madras and Calcutta, administered by the East India Company. French India was governed from <b>Pondicherry</b> (modern Puducherry) on the Coromandel Coast. British forces in India were considerably stronger than the French, with the British Indian Army supported by British Army detachments and a Royal Navy squadron under Rear-Admiral William Cornwallis. Pondicherry's defenses were strong, but the garrison was too small to effectively man the walls, and although a French frigate squadron was stationed at the distant Île de France, it was unable to effectively protect the French Indian coast.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{relationships of}} the <b>Pondicherry</b> shark are uncertain. In a 1988 study based on morphological data, Compagno tentatively grouped {{it with the}} smalltail shark (C. porosus), blackspot shark (C. sealei), spottail shark (C. sorrah), creek whaler (C. fitzroyensis), whitecheek shark (C. dussumieri), Borneo shark (C. borneensis), and hardnose shark (C. macloti).|$|E
5|$|After a gap {{of several}} decades, {{in the early}} 1980s, Vimala Begley studied the {{ceramics}} find of the site and proposed a preliminary version of the chronology of the occupation of the site. At {{the same time she}} started researching on the beads, organized a proper sequential display of the artifacts of the site at the <b>Pondicherry</b> Museum, and brought out an information brochure.|$|E
5|$|Deflated by his situation, Nguyễn Ánh asked Pigneau {{to appeal}} for French aid, and allowed Pigneau {{to take his}} son Nguyễn Phúc Cảnh with him {{as a sign of}} good faith. This came about after Nguyễn Ánh had {{considered}} enlisting English, Dutch, Portuguese and Spanish assistance. Pigneau advised against Nguyễn Ánh's original plan to seek Dutch aid from Batavia, fearing that the support of the Protestant Dutch would hinder the advancement of Catholicism. Pigneau left Vietnam in December, arriving in <b>Pondicherry,</b> India in February 1785 with Nguyễn Ánh's royal seal. Nguyễn Ánh had authorized him to make concessions to France in return for military assistance. The French administration in <b>Pondicherry,</b> led by acting governor Coutenceau des Algrains, was conservative in outlook and resolutely opposed intervention in southern Vietnam. To compound the already complex situation, Pigneau was denounced by Spanish Franciscans in the Vatican, and he sought to transfer his political mandate to Portuguese forces. The Portuguese had earlier offered Nguyễn Ánh 56 ships to use against the Tây Sơn.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Raymond's {{office had}} {{accepted}} {{a commission to}} design a dormitory for the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in <b>Pondicherry,</b> part of French India in southeast India. A preliminary site visit was made by George Nakashima and the schematic design was completed in 1936. Although Raymond had envisioned that the dormitory would be completed in six months, Sri Aurobindo was concerned that the noise of construction would disturb the ashram, so he decided that the building would be constructed by its residents.|$|E
5|$|Kalki Koechlin {{was born}} in <b>Pondicherry,</b> India, on 10 January 1984 to French parents, Joel Koechlin and Françoise Armandie, who came to India from Angers, France. She is a {{descendant}} of Maurice Koechlin, a French structural engineer who {{played an important role}} in the design and construction of the Eiffel Tower. Koechlin's parents are devotees of Sri Aurobindo. The family later settled in Kallatty, a village near Ooty in Tamil Nadu, where Koechlin's father established a business designing hang-gliders and ultralight aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Linois {{had escaped}} so swiftly that his anchors and boats {{had been left}} in the bay, where he had {{abandoned}} them rather than draw attention to his movements by drawing them in. He had also just missed the transport Côte d'Or with its 326 soldiers, which arrived {{on the evening of}} 13 July and was swiftly surrounded by Centurion and Concorde. Detaching most of his squadron to Madras, Rainier waited off <b>Pondicherry</b> for further French movements and on 15 July spotted Belle Poule just off the coast. Linois had detached the frigate to investigate the anchorage at Madras, but she had been intercepted and followed by the frigate , whose insistent shadowing had forced Captain Alain-Adélaïde-Marie Bruilhac to return to <b>Pondicherry.</b> Belle Poule and Côte d'Or exchange signals during the morning, and at 11:00 the transport suddenly raised sails and departed the anchorage, Terpsichore pursuing closely. Early on 16 July, Terpsichore overtook the transport and fired several shots across her bow, forcing her captain to surrender. Bruilhac had used the distraction to sail Belle Poule to Isle de France without pursuit. Côte d'Or was returned to <b>Pondicherry</b> and, since there was no news of war from Europe, released on 24 July on condition that she only sail to Isle de France and no other destination. Dedaigneuse was detached to ensure that the transport followed these conditions and Rainier returned to Madras, joined by Dedaigneuse the following day once the transport's course was ensured. Rainier immediately ordered his ships to take on military supplies in preparation for military operations, although news of the declaration of war, made on 18 May, did not reach him until 13 September.|$|E
5|$|Raymond {{sought to}} {{mitigate}} {{the effects of the}} <b>Pondicherry</b> climate and oriented the Golconde dormitory (as it became known), so that its main facades faced north and south {{to make use of the}} prevailing breeze. A combination of moveable louvres on the exterior skin and woven teak sliding doors permitted ventilation without compromising on privacy. The building is still in use as an ashram today. It was the first modernist building in India.|$|E
5|$|The city is also {{connected}} to the railway network through the Kanchipuram railway station. The ChengalpetArakkonam railway line passes through Kanchipuram and travellers can access services to those destinations. Daily trains are provided to <b>Pondicherry</b> and Tirupati, {{and there is a}} weekly express train to Madurai and a bi-weekly express train to Nagercoil. Two passenger trains from both sides of Chengalpattu and Arakkonam pass via Kanchipuram.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} brought {{widespread rain}} {{to much of}} Tamil Nadu, with heavy rain hitting the coastal regions. Low-lying coastal regions from <b>Pondicherry</b> to Atirampattinam. There was damage to crops and housing in Thanjavur District and the rains left thousands homeless in Madras. Cuddalore experienced exceptionally heavy rains with over 440mm (17inches) falling there, of which 310mm (12inches) fell on November 20 alone.|$|E
5|$|Britain {{joined the}} French Revolutionary Wars in February 1793, {{but the news}} did not reach the Indian Ocean for four months. The {{immediate}} priority of the British squadron under Commodore William Cornwallis in British India was the capture of the French colonies in India, especially their main port of <b>Pondicherry.</b> Once the British had completed this operation {{at the end of}} August 1793, the squadron returned to Europe. This left British commerce in Eastern waters badly exposed, and privateers and warships operating from Isle de France captured a number of merchant vessels, including the large East Indiaman Princess Royal, which three privateer corvettes seized on 27 September in the Sunda Strait.|$|E
5|$|His mother, Marie Anne Lienard de Boisjoly {{married his}} father, Christophe Claude d'Hastrel, a gentleman from the Île de Ré, {{a small island}} off the coast of France near La Rochelle, on 12 February 1760 in Neuville. The senior d'Hastrel was a captain in the Languedoc Regiment, in a company of grenadiers. He participated in the Siege of <b>Pondicherry</b> in the Seven Years' War. Etienne d'Hastrel's elder brother, Jacques Bruno D'Hastrel, ecuyer (equerry), Chevalier, and Lord of Rivedoux, was a Knight of the Order of Saint Louis. Upon their father's death in 1782, he {{inherited}} the family estates and titles.|$|E
5|$|In 1910 Aurobindo withdrew {{himself from}} all {{political}} activities {{and went into}} hiding at Chandannagar {{in the house of}} Motilal Roy, while the British were trying to prosecute him for sedition {{on the basis of a}} signed article titled 'To My Countrymen', published in Karmayogin. As Aurobindo disappeared from view, the warrant was held back and the prosecution postponed. Aurobindo manoeuvred the police into open action and a warrant was issued on 4 April 1910, but the warrant could not be executed because on that date he had reached <b>Pondicherry,</b> then a French colony. The warrant against Aurobindo was withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|In <b>Pondicherry,</b> Aurobindo {{dedicated}} {{himself to}} his spiritual and philosophical pursuits. In 1914, {{after four years of}} secluded yoga, he started a monthly philosophical magazine called Arya. This ceased publication in 1921. Many years later, he revised some of these works before they were published in book form. Some of the book series derived out of this publication were The Life Divine, The Synthesis of Yoga, Essays on The Gita, The Secret of The Veda, Hymns to the Mystic Fire, The Upanishads, The Renaissance in India, War and Self-determination, The Human Cycle, The Ideal of Human Unity and The Future Poetry were published in this magazine.|$|E
5|$|Kanchipuram is {{most easily}} {{accessible}} by road. The ChennaiBangalore National Highway, NH 4 passes {{the outskirts of}} the city. Daily bus services are provided by the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation to and from Chennai, Bangalore, Villupuram, Tirupathi, Thiruthani, Tiruvannamalai, Vellore, Salem, Coimbatore, Tindivanam and <b>Pondicherry.</b> There are two major bus routes to Chennai, one connecting via Guindy and the other via Tambaram. Local bus services are provided by The Villupuram division of Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation. As of 2006, there were a total of 403 buses for 191 routes operated out of the city.|$|E
5|$|News of the {{outbreak}} of war took five months to reach the Indian Ocean but British forces, recently engaged in the Third Anglo-Mysore War, were mobilised in preparation and immediately seized the ports of French India. Only <b>Pondicherry</b> was able to resist, and a siege was instigated on 1 August 1793 by Colonel John Braithwaite while Cornwallis imposed a naval blockade. British forces constructed trenches and batteries, often under heavy fire, over the following weeks. Twenty days after the city was cut off, Braithwaite began a bombardment of the defences. Within hours the French commander Colonel Prosper de Clermont requested a truce, followed the next morning by an unconditional surrender.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Pondicherry</b> shark (Carcharhinus hemiodon) is an {{extremely}} rare species of requiem shark, in the family Carcharhinidae. A small and stocky gray shark, it grows not much longer than , {{and it has a}} fairly long, pointed snout. This species can be identified by the shape of its upper teeth, which are strongly serrated near the base and smooth-edged near the tip, and by its first dorsal fin, which is large with a long free rear tip. Furthermore, this shark has prominent black tips on its pectoral fins, second dorsal fin, and caudal fin lower lobe.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{relationships of}} the Borneo shark are uncertain. Jack Garrick, in his 1982 morphological study, did not place {{it close to}} any other member of the genus. Leonard Compagno in 1988 tentatively grouped it with the smalltail shark (C. porosus), blackspot shark (C. sealei), spottail shark (C. sorrah), creek whaler (C. fitzroyensis), whitecheek shark (C. dussumieri), hardnose shark (C. macloti), and <b>Pondicherry</b> shark (C. hemiodon). The Borneo shark resembles the sharpnose sharks (Rhizoprionodon) in certain traits, for example the enlarged pores by its mouth. Nevertheless, other aspects of its morphology firmly place it within Carcharhinus.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{relationships of}} the hardnose shark {{have not been}} fully resolved. In a 1988 study based on morphology, Leonard Compagno tentatively grouped the hardnose shark with the Borneo shark (C. borneensis), whitecheek shark (C. dussumieri), <b>Pondicherry</b> shark (C. hemiodon), creek whaler (C. fitzroyensis), smalltail shark (C. porosus), blackspot shark (C. sealei), and spottail shark (C. sorrah). Results from molecular phylogenetic analyses have been inconsistent, with some supporting parts of Compagno's hypothesis: a 1992 study could not resolve the hardnose shark's position in detail, a 2011 study reported that {{it was close to}} the clade formed by the whitecheek and blackspot sharks, and a 2012 study concluded that it was the sister species of the Borneo shark.|$|E
5|$|The {{integration}} of the princely states {{raised the question of}} the future of the remaining colonial enclaves in India. At independence, the regions of <b>Pondicherry,</b> Karikal, Yanam, Mahe and Chandernagore were still colonies of France, and Daman and Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Goa remained colonies of Portugal. An agreement between France and India in 1948 provided for an election in France's remaining Indian possessions to choose their political future. A plebiscite held in Chandernagore on 19 June 1949 resulted in a vote of 7,463 to 114 in favour of being integrated with India. It was ceded to India on a de facto basis on 14 August 1949 and de jure on 2 May 1950. In the other enclaves, however, the pro-French camp, led by Edouard Goubert, used the administrative machinery to suppress the pro-merger groups. Popular discontent rose, and in 1954 demonstrations in Yanam and Mahe resulted in pro-merger groups assuming power. A referendum in <b>Pondicherry</b> and Karaikal in October 1954 resulted in a vote in favour of merger, and on 1 November 1954, de facto control over all four enclaves was transferred to the Republic of India. A treaty of cession was signed in May 1956, and following ratification by the French National Assembly in May 1962, de jure control of the enclaves was also transferred.|$|E
5|$|Aurobindo {{studied for}} the Indian Civil Service at King's College, Cambridge, England. After {{returning}} to India {{he took up}} various civil service works under the maharaja of the princely state of Baroda and began increasingly involved in nationalist politics and the nascent revolutionary movement in Bengal. He was arrested {{in the aftermath of}} a number of bomb outrages linked to his organisation, but in a highly public trial where he faced charges of treason, Aurobindo could only be convicted and imprisoned for writing articles against British rule in India. He was released when no evidence could be provided, following the murder of a prosecution-witness during the trial. During his stay in the jail he had mystical and spiritual experiences, after which he moved to <b>Pondicherry,</b> leaving politics for spiritual work.|$|E
5|$|Aurobindo's close spiritual collaborator, Mirra Richard (b. Alfassa), came to {{be known}} as The Mother. She was a French national, born in Paris on 21 February 1878. In her 20s she studied occultism with Max Theon. Along with her husband, Paul Richard, she went to <b>Pondicherry</b> on 29 March 1914, and finally settled there in 1920. Aurobindo {{considered}} her his spiritual equal and collaborator. After 24 November 1926, when Aurobindo retired into seclusion, he left it to her to plan, build and run the ashram, the community of disciples which had gathered around them. Some time later, when families with children joined the ashram, she established and supervised the Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education with its experiments in the field of education. When he died in 1950, She continued their spiritual work, directed the ashram, and guided their disciples.|$|E
5|$|On 1 February 1793, the French Republic {{declared}} war on Great Britain and the Dutch Republic, extending the already existing French Revolutionary Wars. It took several months for news of the outbreak of war to reach British India, messages arriving at Calcutta from Consul George Baldwin at Alexandria on 11 June. The Royal Navy commander in the region, Commodore William Cornwallis, immediately set about demanding the surrender of the French trading posts in India. Most fell within a few days, but the major port of <b>Pondicherry</b> refused, and was besieged from 1 August. The siege lasted {{a month before the}} French commander capitulated under bombardment from British land and naval forces. With the French presence eliminated from India, Cornwallis was ordered to return to Europe, leaving minimal naval forces in the Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Sir R.E.M.Wheeler, the Director General of the Archaeological Survey of India, in the 1940s {{saw a few}} {{potsherds}} of Arikamedu site {{displayed in}} the Madras Museum, which he identified as Arrentine ware, an expensive ceramic made until 50 CE in Arizzo, Italy. Thereafter, when he visited the <b>Pondicherry</b> Museum and saw more of {{the findings from the}} Arikamedu site, he was impressed and thought that he had found the links between the Classical Mediterranean and Ancient India. Soon thereafter in 1945, the penultimate year of World War II, he mounted excavations in a scientific manner. He was looking for an archaeological site in India that could establish its cultural link, a datum of the Indian antiquities to the Greco-Roman period, and this quest led him to the Arikamedu site. These excavations also involved Indian archaeologists, who were trained on the site.|$|E
