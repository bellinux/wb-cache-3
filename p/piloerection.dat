5|$|The {{clinical}} features of latrodectism are similar for all species of Latrodectus spiders and is generally characterised by extreme pain. Initially, the bite may be painful, but sometimes only {{feels like a}} pin prick or mild burning sensation. Within an hour victims generally develop more severe local pain with local sweating and sometimes <b>piloerection</b> (goosebumps). Pain, swelling and redness spread proximally from the site. Less commonly, systemic envenoming is heralded by swollen or tender regional lymph nodes; associated features include malaise, nausea, vomiting, abdominal or chest pain, generalised sweating, headache, fever, hypertension and tremor. Rare complications include seizure, coma, pulmonary edema, respiratory failure or localised skin infection. The duration of effects can range from {{a few hours to}} days, with severe pain persisting for over 24 hours after being bitten in some cases.|$|E
5|$|The gray wolf's {{expressive}} {{behavior is}} more complex than that of the coyote and golden jackal, as necessitated by its group living and hunting habits. While less gregarious canids generally possess simple repertoires of visual signals, wolves have more varied signals that subtly inter grade in intensity. When neutral, the legs are not stiffened, the tail hangs down loosely, the face is smooth, the lips untensed, and the ears point in no particular direction. Postural communication in wolves consists of a variety of facial expressions, tail positions and <b>piloerection.</b> Aggressive, or self-assertive wolves are characterized by their slow and deliberate movements, high body posture and raised hackles, while submissive ones carry their bodies low, sleeken their fur and lower their ears and tail. When a breeding male encounters a subordinate family member, it may stare at it, standing erect and still with the tails horizontal to its spine. Two forms of submissive behavior are recognized: passive and active. Passive submission usually occurs as a reaction to the approach of a dominant animal, and consists of the submissive wolf lying partly on its back and allowing the dominant wolf to sniff its anogenital area. Active submission occurs often as a form of greeting, and involves the submissive wolf approaching another in a low posture, and licking the other wolf's face. When wolves are together, they commonly indulge in behaviors such as nose pushing, jaw wrestling, cheek rubbing and facial licking. The mouthing of each other's muzzles is a friendly gesture, while clamping on the muzzle with bared teeth is a dominance display.|$|E
25|$|At {{low ambient}} {{temperatures}} the common ostrich utilizes feather flattening, which conserves body heat through insulation. The low conductance coefficient of air allows less heat {{to be lost}} to the environment. This flattening behavior compensate for common ostrich's rather poor cutaneous evaporative water loss (CEWL). These feather heavy {{areas such as the}} body, thighs and wings do not usually vary much from ambient temperatures due to this behavioural controls. This ostrich will also cover its legs to reduce heat loss to the environment, along with undergoing <b>piloerection</b> and shivering when faced with low ambient temperatures.|$|E
25|$|Though {{aggression}} {{can occur}} within groups, the response towards intruders of another species {{is much more}} drastic and can involve a sexual dimorphism in displays. Females typically employ scent-marking intruder response tactics, whereas males {{are more prone to}} vocalizing threats, physical aggression, and <b>piloerection.</b> Scent-marking in cotton-top tamarins is done in two ways: either using anogenital scent-marking, or suprapubic scent-marking. The ability to use both of these separate glandular fields for threat signals may indicate females have developed diverging evolutionary threats through differential use of these markings. These variable signals may be used to sign a territorial encounter, or serve as a reproductive signal. The intensity of female threats are generally comparable when directed at intruders of either genders. In contrast, male cotton-tops are considerably more threatening towards fellow males than towards females.|$|E
500|$|The redback's {{small size}} means that {{swelling}} or puncture marks at the bite site are uncommon. The bite may be painful from the start, {{but more often}} only feels like a pinprick or mild burning sensation. Within an hour, a more severe local pain may develop with local sweating and sometimes <b>piloerection</b> (goosebumps)—these three symptoms together are a classic presentation of redback spider envenomation. Pain, swelling and redness can spread proximally up a limb or away from the bite site ...|$|E
500|$|Like many rodents, {{guinea pigs}} {{sometimes}} participate in social grooming, and they regularly self-groom. A milky-white substance is secreted from {{their eyes and}} rubbed into the hair during the grooming process. Groups of boars often chew each other's hair, {{but this is a}} method of establishing hierarchy within a group, rather than a social gesture. Dominance is also established through biting (especially of the ears), <b>piloerection,</b> aggressive noises, head thrusts, and leaping attacks. Non-sexual simulated [...] for dominance is also common among same-sex groups.|$|E
500|$|Olfaction is {{probably}} the wolf's most acute sense, and plays {{a fundamental role in}} communication. The wolf has a large number of apocrine sweat glands on the face, lips, back, and between the toes. The odor produced by these glands varies according to the individual wolf's microflora and diet, giving each a distinct [...] "odor fingerprint". A combination of apocrine and eccrine sweat glands on the feet allows the wolf to deposit its scent whilst scratching the ground, which usually occurs after urine marking and defecation during the breeding season. The follicles present on the guard hairs from the wolf's back have clusters of apocrine and sebaceous glands at their bases. As the skin on the back is usually folded, this provides a microclimate for bacterial propagation around the glands. During <b>piloerection,</b> the guard hairs on the back are raised and the skin folds spread, thus releasing scent. The pre-caudal scent glands {{may play a role in}} expressing aggression, as combative wolves raise the base of their tails whilst drooping the tip, thus positioning the scent glands at the highest point. The wolf possesses a pair of anal sacs beneath the rectum, which contain both apocrine and sebaceous glands. The components of anal sac secretions vary according to season and gender, thus indicating that the secretions provide information related to gender and reproductive state. The secretions of the preputial glands may advertise hormonal condition or social position, as dominant wolves have been observed to stand over subordinates, apparently presenting the genital area for investigation, which may include genital licking. During the breeding season, female wolves secrete substances from the vagina, which communicate the females' reproductive state, and can be detected by males from long distances. Urine marking is the best-studied means of olfactory communication in wolves. Its exact function is debated, though most researchers agree that its primary purpose is to establish boundaries. Wolves urine mark more frequently and vigorously in unfamiliar areas, or areas of intrusion, where the scent of other wolves or canids is present. So-called raised leg urination (RLU) is more common in male wolves than in females, and may serve the purpose of maximizing the possibility of detection by conspecifics, as well as reflect the height of the marking wolf. Only dominant wolves typically use RLU, with subordinate males continuing to use the juvenile standing posture throughout adulthood. RLU is considered to be one of the most important forms of scent communication in the wolf, making up 60–80% of all scent marks observed.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{physiological}} {{changes in}} the body are associated with fear, summarized as the fight-or-flight response. An inborn response for coping with danger, it works by accelerating the breathing rate (hyperventilation), heart rate, constriction of the peripheral blood vessels leading to blushing and vasodilation of the central vessels (pooling), [...] increasing muscle tension including the muscles attached to each hair follicle to contract and causing [...] "goose bumps", or more clinically, <b>piloerection</b> (making a cold person warmer or a frightened animal look more impressive), sweating, increased blood glucose (hyperglycemia), increased serum calcium, increase in white blood cells called neutrophilic leukocytes, alertness leading to sleep disturbance and [...] "butterflies in the stomach" [...] (dyspepsia). This primitive mechanism may help an organism survive by either running away or fighting the danger. With the series of physiological changes, the consciousness realizes an emotion of fear.|$|E

5000|$|Frisson (French for 'shiver') is a {{sensation}} somewhat like shivering, usually caused by stimuli other than cold. It is typically expressed as an overwhelming emotional response combined with <b>piloerection</b> (goosebumps). Stimuli that produce a response {{are specific to}} the individual.|$|E
50|$|<b>Piloerection</b> is also {{a classic}} symptom of some diseases, such as {{temporal}} lobe epilepsy, some brain tumors, and autonomic hyperreflexia. Goose bumps can also be caused by withdrawal from opiates such as heroin. A skin condition that mimics goose bumps in appearance is keratosis pilaris.|$|E
50|$|There are no tests {{required}} to diagnose widow spider bites, or latrodectism symptoms. The diagnosis is clinical {{and based on}} historic evidence of widow spider bites. Pathognomonic symptoms such as localized sweating and <b>piloerection</b> provide evidence of envenomation. Unlike the brown recluse, the widow species are easily identified by most people.|$|E
50|$|The {{symptoms}} of a sympathomimetic toxidrome include anxiety, delusions, diaphoresis, hyperreflexia, mydriasis, paranoia, <b>piloerection,</b> and seizures. Complications include hypertension, and tachycardia. Substances that may cause this toxidrome include salbutamol, amphetamines, cocaine, ephedrine (Ma Huang), methamphetamine, phenylpropanolamine (PPA's), and pseudoephedrine. It may appear {{very similar to the}} anticholinergic toxidrome, but is distinguished by hyperactive bowel sounds and sweating.|$|E
50|$|Attached to the {{follicle}} {{is a tiny}} {{bundle of}} muscle fiber called the arrector pili. This muscle is responsible for causing the follicle lissis to become more perpendicular {{to the surface of}} the skin, and causing the follicle to protrude slightly above the surrounding skin (<b>piloerection)</b> and a pore encased with skin oil. This process results in goose bumps (or goose flesh).|$|E
5000|$|In sheep, halostachine {{produced}} {{only a slight}} mydriasis at a dose of 30 mg/kg, i.v., and [...] "excitation" [...] at 100 mg/kg; in guinea pigs, doses of 30 mg/kg, i.p., produced restlessness lasting about 1/2 hour, but 100 mg/kg, i.p., caused excitement, mydriasis, salivation, <b>piloerection,</b> muscular tremors, and increased heart and respiratory rates, with a return to normal after 1/2-2 hours.|$|E

50|$|Although {{hypothermia}} {{is usually}} {{diagnosed with a}} body temperature of 35 °C / 95° Fahrenheit, or less, incipient cooling caused by deregulation in the CNS, needs to be monitored because it can promote {{the development of an}} infection. The patient may report feeling cold, followed by mild chills, cold skin, moderate pallor, tachycardia, hypertension, tremor or <b>piloerection.</b> External warming techniques are advised to prevent hypothermia.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} shown that during frisson, the skin of the lower back flexes, and shivers rise upward and inward from the shoulders, up the neck, and may extend to the cheeks and scalp. The face may become flush, hair follicles {{experience}} <b>piloerection.</b> This frequently occurs in a series of 'waves' moving up the back in rapid succession. The frissoner usually feels the experience as involuntary.|$|E
50|$|In a 1981 paper, Costall and {{co-workers}} reported that DMDA, in doses of 0.5-8 mg/kg given i.p. to mice, produced a dose-dependent reduction in spontaneous motor activity (occurring within a 20 minute period after drug administration). They also observed <b>piloerection</b> at 2 mg/kg, and prostration accompanying the 8 mg/kg or higher doses. The effects of DMDA were not altered {{by the administration}} of spiroperidol.|$|E
50|$|The minute muscles {{under the}} surface of the skin called arrector pili muscles (attached to an {{individual}} hair follicle) contract (<b>piloerection),</b> lifting the hair follicle upright. This makes the hairs stand on end, which acts as an insulating layer, trapping heat. This is what also causes goose bumps since humans do not have very much hair and the contracted muscles can easily be seen.|$|E
5000|$|Communication occurs both though vocalization and by visual gestures. [...] Vocalizations {{that have}} been {{recorded}} include whistles, twitters, trills, loud or soft sharp notes, sneezes and long rasps. [...] Body postures and displays that reveal more of the white coloration, such as standing on hind legs and <b>piloerection,</b> tend {{to be associated with}} aggression. [...] Females often signal willingness to mate by rapidly coiling their tails.|$|E
5000|$|At {{very high}} doses {{characterized}} by overdose, {{a number of}} symptoms may come to prominence, including severe cognitive deficit {{to the point of}} acute retardation, anterograde or retrograde amnesia, drooling, <b>piloerection</b> or [...] "goose bumps", agitation or restlessness, flailing, thrashing, and screaming, unintentional or accidental injury, delirium, hallucinations, myoclonus, dystonia, paralysis, stupor, faintness or loss of consciousness, seizures or convulsions, status epilepticus, coma, and respiratory arrest or cessation of breathing, potentially resulting in hospitalization, brain damage, and/or death.|$|E
50|$|The {{formation}} of goose bumps in humans under stress {{is considered by}} some to be a vestigial reflex; some believe its function in human ancestors was to raise the bodys hair, making the ancestor appear larger to scare off predators. The reflex of producing goose bumps is known as <b>piloerection</b> or the pilomotor reflex. It occurs in many mammals besides humans; a prominent example is porcupines, which raise their quills when threatened, or sea otters when they encounter sharks or other predators.|$|E
5000|$|Sympathetic and {{parasympathetic}} nervous {{systems and}} the hypothalamus are regulated by the higher brain. Through them, the higher cerebral cortex areas can control the immune system, and the body’s homeostatic and stress physiology. Areas doing this include the insular cortex, the orbital, and the medial prefrontal cortices. These cerebral areas also control smooth muscle and glandular physiological processes through the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system including blood circulation, urogenital, gastrointestinal [...] functions, pancreatic gut secretions, [...] respiration, coughing, vomiting, <b>piloerection,</b> pupil dilation, lacrimation and salivation.|$|E
50|$|At {{low ambient}} {{temperatures}} the common ostrich utilizes feather flattening, which conserves body heat through insulation.

This ostrich will also cover its legs to reduce heat loss to the environment, along with undergoing <b>piloerection</b> and shivering when faced with low ambient temperatures.|$|E
50|$|Shannon and {{co-workers}} confirmed and extended some of Tainter's studies. After administering phenylethanolamine to dogs intravenously, these investigators observed that 10-30 mg/kg {{of the drug}} increased pupil diameter, and decreased body temperature; a dose of 10 or 17.5 mg/kg decreased heart rate, but a 30 mg/kg dose caused it to increase. Other effects that were noted included profuse salivation and <b>piloerection.</b> Phenylethanolamine also produced behavioral effects such as stereotyped head movement, rapid eye movement, and repetitive tongue extrusion. These and other observations were suggested {{to be consistent with}} an action on α- and β-adrenergic receptors.|$|E
50|$|The pygmy {{marmoset}} {{has other}} ways to communicate information about matters such as the female's ovulatory state. New World monkeys do not show genital swelling during ovulation as female Old World monkeys do. Instead, a lack of female aggression towards males {{can serve as a}} signal of ovulation. Scent glands on its chest, anus, and genitals are also rubbed on surfaces which leave chemical signals about the reproductive state of the female. The pygmy marmoset also performs visual displays such as strutting, back-arching, and <b>piloerection</b> when it feels threatened or to show dominance.|$|E
50|$|A {{threat from}} another animal {{does not always}} result in {{immediate}} fight or flight. There may be a period of heightened awareness, during which each animal interprets behavioral signals from the other. Signs such as paling, <b>piloerection,</b> immobility, sounds, and body language communicate the status and intentions of each animal. There may {{be a sort of}} negotiation, after which fight or flight may ensue, but which might also result in playing, mating, or nothing at all. An example of this is kittens playing: each kitten shows the signs of sympathetic arousal, but they never inflict real damage.|$|E
50|$|However, the English word 'shiver' {{signifies the}} rhythmic {{involuntary}} contraction of skeletal muscles which serves {{the function of}} generating heat in response to low temperatures, has variable duration, and is often reported subjectively as unpleasant. By distinction, the French word 'frisson', signifies a brief sensation usually reported as pleasurable and often expressed as an overwhelming emotional response to stimuli, such {{as a piece of}} music. Frisson often occurs simultaneously with <b>piloerection,</b> colloquially known as 'goosebumps', by which tiny muscles called arrector pili contract, causing body hair, particularly that on the limbs and back of the neck, to erect or 'stand on end'.|$|E
5000|$|People {{often say}} they feel their [...] "hair {{standing}} on end" [...] when they are frightened or in awe. In an extremely stressful situation, the body can employ the [...] "fight or flight" [...] response. As the body prepares itself for either fighting or running, the sympathetic nervous system floods the blood with adrenaline (epinephrine), a hormone that speeds up heart rate, metabolism, and body temperature {{in the presence of}} extreme stress. Then the sympathetic nervous system also causes the <b>piloerection</b> reflex, which makes the muscles attached to the base of each hair follicle contract and force the hair up.|$|E
