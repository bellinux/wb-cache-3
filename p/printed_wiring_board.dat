25|$|When {{the board}} has no {{embedded}} components it is more correctly called a <b>printed</b> <b>wiring</b> <b>board</b> (PWB) or etched wiring board. However, the term <b>printed</b> <b>wiring</b> <b>board</b> has fallen into disuse. A PCB populated with electronic components is called a printed circuit assembly (PCA), {{printed circuit board assembly}} or PCB assembly (PCBA). The IPC preferred term for assembled boards is circuit card assembly (CCA), and for assembled backplanes it is backplane assemblies. The term PCB is used informally both for bare and assembled boards.|$|E
50|$|In electronics, the BOM {{represents}} {{the list of}} components used on the <b>printed</b> <b>wiring</b> <b>board</b> or printed circuit board.

50|$|Inputs to {{the process}} can be {{classified}} as: Design Input, Material Input, Process parameter Input. The output of the process is a <b>printed</b> <b>wiring</b> <b>board</b> that meets the process specification limits.

50|$|Die {{attachment}} is {{the step}} during which a die is mounted and {{fixed to the}} package or support structure (header). For high-powered applications, the die is usually eutectic bonded onto the package, using e.g. gold-tin or gold-silicon solder (for good heat conduction). For low-cost, low-powered applications, the die is often glued directly onto a substrate (such as a <b>printed</b> <b>wiring</b> <b>board)</b> using an epoxy adhesive.|$|E
50|$|A coupon or {{test coupon}} is {{a printed circuit}} board (PCB) used to test the quality of a <b>printed</b> <b>wiring</b> <b>board</b> (PWB) {{fabrication}} process. Test coupons are fabricated on the same panel as the PWBs, typically at the edges. Coupons are then inspected to ensure proper layer alignment, electrical connectivity, and cross sectioned to inspect internal structures. Coupons can be designed custom for a PWB or selected from a vendor library.|$|E

50|$|Board-level {{circuit designs}} {{can often be}} breadboarded for testing. Even with a breadboard, some circuit {{properties}} may not be accurate compared to the final <b>printed</b> <b>wiring</b> <b>board,</b> such as parasitic resistances and capacitances. These parasitic components can often be estimated more accurately using SPICE simulation. Also, designers may want {{more information about the}} circuit than is available from a single mock-up. For instance, circuit performance is affected by component manufacturing tolerances. In these cases it is common to use SPICE to perform Monte Carlo simulations of the effect of component variations on performance, a task which is impractical using calculations by hand for a circuit of any appreciable complexity.|$|E

5000|$|A hybrid {{integrated}} circuit, HIC, hybrid microcircuit, {{or simply}} hybrid is a miniaturized electronic circuit constructed of individual devices, such as semiconductor devices (e.g. transistors and diodes) and passive components (e.g. resistors, inductors, transformers, and capacitors), bonded to a substrate or {{printed circuit board}} (PCB). If the components are on <b>Printed</b> <b>Wiring</b> <b>Board</b> (PWB) then, according {{to the definition of}} MIL-PRF-38534, it is not considered hybrid. A PCB can be called PWB if does not contain embedded components. Hybrid circuits are often encapsulated in epoxy, as shown in the photo. A hybrid circuit serves as a component on a PCB {{in the same way as}} a monolithic integrated circuit; the difference between the two types of devices is in how they are constructed and manufactured. The advantage of hybrid circuits is that components which cannot be included in a monolithic IC can be used, e.g., capacitors of large value, wound components, crystals, inductors.|$|E
5000|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has {{published}} a life-cycle assessment (LCA) of {{the environmental impacts of}} lead-free and tin-lead solder, as used in electronic products. [...] For bar solders, when only lead-free solders were considered, the tin/copper alternative had the lowest (best) scores. For paste solders, bismuth/tin/silver had the lowest impact scores among the lead-free alternatives in every category except non-renewable resource consumption. For both paste and bar solders, all of the lead-free solder alternatives had a lower (better) LCA score in toxicity categories than tin/lead solder. This is primarily due to the toxicity of lead, and the amount of lead that leaches from <b>printed</b> <b>wiring</b> <b>board</b> assemblies, as determined by the leachability study conducted by the partnership. The study results are providing the industry with an objective analysis of the life-cycle environmental effects of leading candidate alternative lead-free solders, allowing industry to consider environmental concerns along with the traditionally evaluated parameters of cost and performance. This assessment is also allowing industry to redirect efforts toward products and processes that reduce solders' environmental footprint, including energy consumption, releases of toxic chemicals, and potential risks to human health and the environment. Another life-cycle assessment by IKP, University of Stuttgart, shows similar results to those of the EPA study.|$|E
50|$|The metal traces {{shown in}} the figure for {{conducting}} electric current into the thermal bump {{may or may not}} be directly connected to the circuitry of the chip. In the case where there are electrical connections to the chip circuitry, on-board temperature sensors and driver circuitry can be used to control the thermal bump in a closed loop fashion to maintain optimal performance. Second, the heat that is pumped by the thermal bump and the additional heat created by the thermal bump in the course of pumping that heat will need to be rejected into the substrate or board. Since the performance of the thermal bump can be improved by providing a good thermal path for the rejected heat, it is beneficial to provide high thermally conductive pathways on the backside of the thermal bump. The substrate could be a highly conductive ceramic substrate like AlN or a metal (e.g., Cu, CuW, CuMo, etc.) with a dielectric. In this case, the high thermal conductance of the substrate will act as a natural pathway for the rejected heat. The substrate might also be a multilayer substrate like a <b>printed</b> <b>wiring</b> <b>board</b> (PWB) designed to provide a high-density interconnect. In this case, the thermal conductivity of the PWB may be relatively poor, so adding thermal vias (e.g. metal plugs) can provide excellent pathways for the rejected heat.|$|E

50|$|A high {{temperature}} Scanning SQUID Microscope using a YBCO SQUID {{is capable of}} measuring magnetic fields as small as 20 pT (about 2 million times weaker than the earth’s magnetic field). The SQUID sensor is sensitive enough that it can detect a wire {{even if it is}} carrying only 10 nA of current at a distance of 100 µm from the SQUID sensor with 1 second averaging. The microscope uses a patented design to allow the sample under investigation to be at room temperature and in air while the SQUID sensor is under vacuum and cooled to less than 80 K using a cryo cooler. No Liquid Nitrogen is used. During non-contact, non-destructive imaging of room temperature samples in air, the system achieves a raw, unprocessed spatial resolution equal to the distance separating the sensor from the current or the effective size of the sensor, whichever is larger. To best locate a wire short in a buried layer, however, a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) back-evolution technique can be used to transform the magnetic field image into an equivalent map of the current in an integrated circuit or <b>printed</b> <b>wiring</b> <b>board.</b> The resulting current map can then be compared to a circuit diagram to determine the fault location. With this post-processing of a magnetic image and the low noise present in SQUID images, it is possible to enhance the spatial resolution by factors of 5 or more over the near-field limited magnetic image. The system’s output is displayed as a false-color image of magnetic field strength or current magnitude (after processing) versus position on the sample. After processing to obtain current magnitude, this microscope has been successful at locating shorts in conductors to within ±16 µm at a sensor-current distance of 150 µm.|$|E
