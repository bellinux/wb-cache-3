The use of pesticides containing chemicals, such as sulfur, copper, microorganisms, viruses, clay powders, or plant extracts (<b>pyrethrum,</b> neem) has {{been approved by the}} EU Organic Standing Committee to improve organic yield and quality. A light coating of kaolin, which forms a physical barrier to some pests, also may help prevent apple sun scalding.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{pesticides}} {{were first}} used around 2500 BC, when the Sumerians used sulphur compounds as insecticides. Modern pest control was {{stimulated by the}} spread across the United States of the Colorado potato beetle. After much discussion, arsenical compounds were used to control the beetle and the predicted poisoning of the human population did not occur. This {{led the way to}} a widespread acceptance of insecticides across the continent. With the industrialisation and mechanization of agriculture in the 18th and 19th centuries, and the introduction of the insecticides <b>pyrethrum</b> and derris, chemical pest control became widespread. In the 20th century, the discovery of several synthetic insecticides, such as DDT, and herbicides boosted this development.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{to control}} the spread of malaria {{suffered}} a major setback in 1930: entomologist Raymond Corbett Shannon discovered imported disease-bearing Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes living in Brazil (DNA analysis later revealed the actual species to be A. arabiensis). This species of mosquito is a particularly efficient vector for malaria and is native to Africa. In 1938, the introduction of this vector caused the greatest epidemic of malaria ever seen in the New World. However, complete eradication of A. gambiae from northeast Brazil and thus from the New World was achieved in 1940 by the systematic application of the arsenic-containing compound Paris green to breeding places, and of <b>pyrethrum</b> spray-killing to adult resting places.|$|E
5000|$|A {{pyrethroid}} is {{an organic}} compound {{similar to the}} natural pyrethrins produced by the flowers of <b>pyrethrums</b> (Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium and C. coccineum). Pyrethroids constitute the majority of commercial household insecticides. In the concentrations used in such products, they may also have insect repellent properties and are generally harmless to humans.|$|R
50|$|Because {{chrysanthemums}} contain <b>pyrethrums,</b> {{they are}} used as companion plants to repel pest insects from nearby crops and ornamental plants. They are thought to repel aphids, bed bugs (Cimex lectularius), leafhoppers, spider mites, harlequin bugs, ticks, pickleworms, and imported cabbage worms, among others, in gardens and farms. For example, they are planted among broccoli plants for protection from several common insect pests.|$|R
40|$|Infestation {{with head}} lice, Pediculus humanus capitis, is a {{worldwide}} problem, especially among primary (elementary) school children. Although studies {{in many different}} countries indicate lower levels of susceptibility to certain insecticides than expected (2 ̆ 7 resistance 2 ̆ 7), there is no empirical data from Australia. Data on the susceptibility of head lice to malathion, <b>pyrethrums</b> and permethrin were collected from four schools in Brisbane and one school in northern Queensland. Since no completely susceptible strain of head lice was available and head lice are difficult to keep in culture, a completely susceptible strain of body lice, Pediculus humanus humanus, was used for reference. All five groups of head lice were less susceptible to malathion, <b>pyrethrums</b> and permethrin than were lice from the reference strain. Moreover, the degree of susceptibility to these insecticides varied substantially among schools. Thus, a pediculicide that controlled lice at one school in Brisbane would not necessarily control head lice at another school in the same city. These preliminary data indicate that detailed information on the susceptibility of the different populations of head lice in Queensland to the different insecticides available is needed to maximize the chance of effective control of these increasingly common parasites...|$|R
25|$|Today, {{insecticides}} {{used for}} the treatment of head lice include organochlorines (lindane), organophosphates (malathion), carbamates (carbaryl), pyrethrins (<b>pyrethrum),</b> pyrethroids (permethrin, phenothrin, bioallethrin), and spinosad (spinosyn A and spinosyn D).|$|E

25|$|Crops {{grown in}} the country include coffee, tea, <b>pyrethrum,</b> bananas, beans, sorghum and potatoes. Coffee and tea are the major cash crops for export, with the high altitudes, steep slopes and {{volcanic}} soils providing favourable conditions.

50|$|The {{molecular}} {{structures of}} modern agrochemicals {{are much more}} complex than in older products, but lower than of their pharma counterparts. The average molecular weight of the top 10 is 330, as compared with 477 for the top 10. In comparison to reagents used in pharmaceutical fine chemical syntheses, hazardous chemicals, e.g. sodium azide, halogens, methyl sulfide, phosgene, phosphorus chlorides, are more frequently used. Agrochemical companies sometimes outsource just these steps, which require specialized equipment, on toll conversion deals. With exception of the pyrethroids, which are photostable modifications of naturally occurring <b>pyrethrums,</b> active ingredients of agrochemicals rarely are chiral. Examples within herbicides are the world’s longstanding top-selling product, Monsanto’s round-up (glyphosate). Syngenta’s cyclohexadione-type mesotrione and paraquat dichloride. Within insecticides, the traditional organophosphates, like malathion, and pyrethroids such as γ-cyhalotrin are being substituted for by neonicotinoids, like Bayer’s imidacloprid and Syngenta’s thiamethoxam and pyrazoles, such as BASF’s fipronil. Chloranthaniliprole {{is the most important}} representative of Du Pont’s award-winning anthranilic diamide family of broad spectrum insecticides. Within fungicides, the strobilurins, a new class, are growing rapidly and already have captured more than 30% of the $10 billion global fungicide market. Syngenta’s azoxystrobin was the first product launched. Also BASF’s F-500 Series, a.o. pyraclostrobin and kresoxim-methyl, Bayer CropScience, and Monsanto are developing new compounds in this class. Combination pesticides, such as Monsanto’s Genuity and SmartStax are more and more frequently used.|$|R
40|$|A {{pyrethroid}} is {{an organic}} compound {{similar to the}} natural pyrethrins produced by the flowers of <b>pyrethrums</b> (Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium and C. coccineum). Pyrethroids constitute the majority of commercial insecticides. The major agricultural pyrethroids at present are esters of 3 -phenoxybenzyl alcohol or α-cyano- 3 -phenoxybenzyl alcohol used as a single isomer (deltamethrin) or as a mixture of four isomers (permethrin) or eight isomers (cypermethrin). Permethrin and cypermethrin are two insecticides commonly used in agricultural production in Kentucky and worldwide. They are very similar in chemical structure, but cypermethrin contains a cyanide (CN) group. It {{was found that the}} CN group affects the physical and chemical properties of the two compounds. We investigated differences in the persistence, vapor pressure and solubility in water that might affect their behavior under field conditions. A CN group at α- carbon of the 3 -phenoxybenzyl-alcohol moiety enhanced the insecticidal activity roughly 3 - 6 fold compared to non-cyano pyrethroids. The solubility of permethrin in water is 5. 5 ˟ 10 - 3 mg/L at 20 ⁰C versus cypermethrin that is 4. 0 × 10 mg/L at 20 ⁰C. Permethrin was extracted from plants using hexane and cleaned-up using a 1. 2 m × 2 mm i. d. open glass chromatographic column packed with Florisil. The GC chromatograms revealed the presence of the two sterioisomers (cis- and trans-permethrin) at retention times of 26. 0 and 26. 6 minutes, that corresponds to half-lives (T 1 / 2) of 4. 45 and 3. 41 d, respectively. The electron impact mass spectrum of permethrin extracted from plant leaves and fruits indicated the molecular weight of 390 and molecular ions of m/z 183, 163, 127, 91, and 51, along with other characteristic fragment ions. The results revealed that the trans-isomer was less persistent than the more stable cis-isomer...|$|R
25|$|In the 1960s and 1970s {{there was}} a rapid decline in {{traditional}} crops such as apples and pears, with other crops and industries eventually rising in their place. During the 15 years until 2010, new agricultural products such as wine, saffron, <b>pyrethrum</b> and cherries have been fostered by the Tasmanian Institute of Agricultural Research.|$|E
25|$|As iron-age {{technology}} moved {{south into}} Africa with migrating ancient Egyptians, they carried their technology with them, including adzes. To this day, iron adzes are used all over rural Africa for various purposes - from digging pit latrines, and chopping firewood, to tilling crop fields - {{whether they are}} of maize (corn), coffee, tea, <b>pyrethrum,</b> beans, millett, yams or a plethora of other cash and subsistence crops.|$|E
25|$|DDT is {{the best-known}} of several chlorine-containing {{pesticides}} {{used in the}} 1940s and 1950s. With <b>pyrethrum</b> in short supply, DDT was used extensively during World War II by the Allies to control the insect vectors of typhus – nearly eliminating the disease {{in many parts of}} Europe. In the South Pacific, it was sprayed aerially for malaria and dengue fever control with spectacular effects. While DDT's chemical and insecticidal properties were important factors in these victories, advances in application equipment coupled with competent organization and sufficient manpower were also crucial to the success of these programs.|$|E
25|$|Before DDT, {{eliminating}} mosquito {{breeding grounds}} by drainage or poisoning with Paris green or <b>pyrethrum</b> was sometimes successful. In {{parts of the}} world with rising living standards, the elimination of malaria was often a collateral benefit of the introduction of window screens and improved sanitation. A variety of usually simultaneous interventions represents best practice. These include antimalarial drugs to prevent or treat infection; improvements in public health infrastructure to diagnose, sequester and treat infected individuals; bednets and other methods intended to keep mosquitoes from biting humans; and vector control strategies such as larvaciding with insecticides, ecological controls such as draining mosquito breeding grounds or introducing fish to eat larvae and indoor residual spraying (IRS) with insecticides, possibly including DDT. IRS involves the treatment of interior walls and ceilings with insecticides. It is particularly effective against mosquitoes, since many species rest on an indoor wall before or after feeding. DDT is one of 12 WHO–approved IRS insecticides.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} plants and trees include [...] "toothache" [...] in their common name. Prickly ash (Zanthoxylum americanum) is {{sometimes}} termed [...] "toothache tree", and its bark, [...] "toothache bark"; whilst Ctenium Americanum is sometimes termed [...] "toothache grass", and Acmella oleracea is called [...] "toothache plant". Pellitory (Anacyclus <b>pyrethrum)</b> was traditionally used to relieve toothache.|$|E
500|$|Other {{insecticides}} {{are available}} for mosquito control, {{as well as physical}} measures, such as draining the wetland breeding grounds and the provision of better sanitation. <b>Pyrethrum</b> (from the flowering plant Chrysanthemum [...] cinerariaefolium) is an economically important source of natural insecticide. Pyrethrins attack the nervous systems of all insects. A few minutes after application, the insect cannot move or fly, while female mosquitoes are inhibited from biting. The use of <b>pyrethrum</b> in insecticide preparations dates to about 400 BCE. Pyrethrins are biodegradable and break down easily on exposure to light. The majority of the world's supply of pyrethrin and Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium comes from Kenya. The flower was first introduced into Kenya and the highlands of Eastern Africa during the late 1920s. The flowers of the plant are harvested shortly after blooming; they are either dried and powdered, or the oils within the flowers are extracted with solvents.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} known since the late 17th century that plants contain [...] {{chemicals}} which are avoided by insects. These chemicals {{have been used by}} man as early insecticides; in 1690 nicotine was extracted from tobacco and used as a contact insecticide. In 1773, insect infested plants were treated with nicotine fumigation by heating tobacco and blowing the smoke over the plants. The flowers of Chrysanthemum species contain pyrethrin which is a potent insecticide. In later years, the applications of plant resistance became an important area of research in agriculture and plant breeding, particularly because they can serve as a safe and low-cost alternative to the use of pesticides. The important role of secondary plant substances in plant defense was described in the late 1950s by Vincent Dethier and G.S. Fraenkel. The use of botanical pesticides is widespread and notable examples include Azadirachtin from the neem (Azadirachta indica), d-Limonene from Citrus species, Rotenone from Derris, Capsaicin from chili pepper and <b>Pyrethrum.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Habitat loss: [...] This {{is one of}} {{the most}} severe threats to gorilla populations. The forests where {{mountain}} gorillas live are surrounded by rapidly increasing human settlement. Through shifting (slash-and-burn) agriculture, pastoral expansion and logging, villages in forest zones cause fragmentation and degradation of habitat. The late 1960s saw the Virunga Conservation Area (VCA) of Rwanda’s national park reduced by more than half of its original size to support the cultivation of <b>Pyrethrum.</b> This led to a massive reduction in mountain gorilla population numbers by the mid-1970s. The resulting deforestation confines the gorillas to isolated deserts. Some groups may raid crops for food, creating further animosity and retaliation.|$|E
2500|$|Overall, {{the table}} clearly shows the {{dominance}} of malaria {{as the cause of}} death throughout the famine. Though the excess mortality due to malarial deaths peaked in December 1943, rates remained high throughout the following year. Scarce supplies of quinine (the most common malaria medication), delivered to rural areas under armed guard, were very frequently diverted to the black market. Advanced anti-malarial drugs such as mepacrine (Atabrine) were distributed almost solely to the military and to [...] "priority classes"; DDT (then relatively new and considered [...] "miraculous") and <b>pyrethrum</b> were sprayed only around military installations. Paris Green was used as an insecticide in some other areas. This unequal distribution of anti-malarial measures may explain a lower incidence of malarial deaths in population centres, where the greatest cause of death was [...] "all other" [...] (probably migrants dying from starvation).|$|E
2500|$|Since before 2000 BC, {{humans have}} {{utilized}} pesticides {{to protect their}} crops. The first known pesticide was elemental sulfur dusting used in ancient Sumer about 4,500 years ago in ancient Mesopotamia. The Rig Veda, which is about 4,000 years old, mentions the use of poisonous plants for pest control. By the 15th century, toxic chemicals such as arsenic, mercury, and lead were being applied to crops to kill pests. In the 17th century, nicotine sulfate was extracted from tobacco leaves for use as an insecticide. The 19th century saw the introduction of two more natural pesticides, <b>pyrethrum,</b> which is derived from chrysanthemums, and rotenone, which {{is derived from the}} roots of tropical vegetables. Until the 1950s, arsenic-based pesticides were dominant. [...] Paul Müller discovered that DDT was a very effective insecticide. Organochlorines such as DDT were dominant, but they were replaced in the U.S. by organophosphates and carbamates by 1975. Since then, pyrethrin compounds have become the dominant insecticide. Herbicides became common in the 1960s, led by [...] "triazine and other nitrogen-based compounds, carboxylic acids such as 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, and glyphosate".|$|E
60|$|The gauchos of the pampas, however, give {{a reason}} for the {{powerful}} smell of the male deer; and, after some hesitation, I have determined to set it down here, for the reader to accept or reject, as he thinks proper. I neither believe nor disbelieve it; for although I do not put great faith in gaucho natural history, my own observations have not infrequently confirmed statements of theirs, which a sceptical person would have regarded as wild indeed. To give one instance: I heard a gaucho relate that while out riding he had been pursued for a considerable distance by a large spider; his hearers laughed at him for a romancer; but as I myself had been attacked and pursued, both when on foot and on horseback, by a large wolf-spider, common on the pampas, I did not join in the laugh. They say that the effluvium of C. campestris is abhorrent to snakes of all kinds, just as <b>pyrethrum</b> powder is to most insects, and even {{go so far as to}} describe its effect as fatal to them; according to this, the smell is therefore a protection to the deer. In places where venomous snakes are extremely abundant, as in the Sierra district on the southern pampas of Buenos Ayres, the gaucho frequently ties a strip of the male deer's skin, which retains its powerful odour for an indefinite time, round the neck of a valuable horse as a protection. It is certain that domestic animals are frequently lost here through snake-bites. The most common poisonous species--the Craspedo-cephalus alternatus, called Vivora de la Cruz in the vernacular--has neither bright colour nor warning rattle to keep off heavy hoofs, and is moreover of so sluggish a temperament that it will allow itself to be trodden on before stirring, with the result that its fangs are not infrequently struck into the nose or foot of browsing beast. Considering, then, the conditions in which C. campestris is placed--and it might also be supposed that venomous snakes have in past times been much more numerous than they are now--it is not impossible to believe that the powerful smell it emits has been made protective, especially when we see in other species how repulsive odours have been turned to account by the principle of natural selection.|$|E
6000|$|With many plants, {{the flowers}} towards {{the outside of}} the {{inflorescence}} are much larger and more conspicuous than the central ones. As I shall not have occasion to refer to plants of this kind in the following chapters, I will here give a few details respecting them. It is familiar to every one that the ray-florets of the Compositae often differ remarkably from the others; and so it is with the outer flowers of many Umbelliferae, some Cruciferae and a few other families. Several species of Hydrangea and Viburnum offer striking instances of the same fact. The Rubiaceous genus Mussaenda presents a very curious appearance from some of the flowers having the tip of one of the sepals developed into a large petal-like expansion, coloured either white or purple. The outer flowers in several Acanthaceous genera are large and conspicuous but sterile; the next in order are smaller, open, moderately fertile and capable of cross-fertilisation; whilst the central ones are cleistogamic, being still smaller, closed and highly fertile; so that here the inflorescence consists of three kinds of flowers. (Introduction/5. J. Scott 'Journal of Botany' London new series volume 1 1872 pages 161-164.) From what we know in other cases of the use of the corolla, coloured bracteae, etc., and from what H. Muller has observed on the frequency of the visits of insects to the flower-heads of the Umbelliferae and Compositae being largely determined by their conspicuousness, {{there can be no doubt}} that the increased size of the corolla of the outer flowers, the inner ones being in all the above cases small, serves to attract insects. (Introduction/6. 'Die Befruchtung der Blumen' pages 108, 412.) The result is that cross-fertilisation is thus favoured. Most flowers wither soon after being fertilised, but Hildebrand states that the ray-florets of the Compositae last for a long time, until all those on the disc are impregnated; and this clearly shows the use of the former. (Introduction/7. See his interesting memoir 'Ueber die Geschlechtsverhaltniss bei den Compositen' 1869 page 92.) The ray-florets, however, are of service in another and very different manner, namely, by folding inwards at night and during cold rainy weather, so as to protect the florets of the disc. (Introduction/8. Kerner clearly shows that this is the case: 'Die Schutzmittel des Pollens' 1873 page 28.) Moreover they often contain matter which is excessively poisonous to insects, as may be seen in the use of flea- powder, and in the case of <b>Pyrethrum,</b> M. Belhomme has shown that the ray-florets are more poisonous than the disc-florets in the ratio of about three to two. We may therefore believe that the ray-florets are useful in protecting the flowers from being gnawed by insects. (Introduction/9. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1861 page 1067. Lindley 'Vegetable Kingdom' on Chrysanthemum 1853 page 706. Kerner in his interesting essay 'Die Schutzmittel der Bluthen gegen unberufene Gaste' 1875 page 19, insists that the petals of most plants contain matter which is offensive to insects, so that they are seldom gnawed, and thus the organs of fructification are protected. My grandfather in 1790 'Loves of the Plants' canto 3 note to lines 184, 188, remarks that [...] "The flowers or petals of plants are perhaps in general more acrid than their leaves; hence they are much seldomer eaten by insects.") ...|$|E
