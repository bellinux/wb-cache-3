2500|$|This means {{creating}} and extending fractures from the perforation tunnels {{deeper into the}} formation, increasing the surface area for formation fluids to flow into the well, as well as extending past any possible damage near the wellbore. This may be done by injecting fluids at high pressure (hydraulic fracturing), injecting fluids laced with round granular material (<b>proppant</b> fracturing), or using explosives to generate a high pressure and high speed gas flow (TNT or PETN up to [...] ) and (propellant stimulation up to [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|In {{hydraulic}} fracturing, well operators force water {{mixed with}} a variety of chemicals through the wellbore casing into the rock. The high pressure water breaks up or [...] "fracks" [...] the rock, which releases gas from the rock formation. Sand and other particles are added to the water as a <b>proppant</b> to keep the fractures in the rock open, thus enabling the gas to flow into the casing and then to the surface. Chemicals are added to the fluid to perform such functions as reducing friction and inhibiting corrosion. After the [...] "frack," [...] oil or gas is extracted and nearly 30 percent to 70 percent of the frack fluid, i.e. the mixture of water, chemicals, sand, etc., flows back to the surface. Many gas-bearing formations also contain water, which will flow up the wellbore to the surface along with the gas, in both hydraulically fractured and non-hydraulically fractured wells. This produced water often has a high content of salt and other dissolved minerals that occur in the formation.|$|E
50|$|The <b>proppant</b> is a {{granular}} material that prevents the created fractures from closing after the fracturing treatment. Types of <b>proppant</b> include silica sand, resin-coated sand, bauxite, and man-made ceramics. The choice of <b>proppant</b> {{depends on the}} type of permeability or grain strength needed. In some formations, where the pressure is great enough to crush grains of natural silica sand, higher-strength proppants such as bauxite or ceramics may be used. The most commonly used <b>proppant</b> is silica sand, though proppants of uniform size and shape, such as a ceramic <b>proppant,</b> are believed to be more effective.|$|E
40|$|The {{shale gas}} {{production}} {{has brought a}} revolution in US energy market and the global prospect of shale gas production is on continuous increase. The advancements in hydraulic fracturing {{made it possible to}} extract very low permeability shale gas through fracturing the shale rock. The once fractured shale rock is kept open with the induction of spherical particles known as <b>proppants.</b> The performance of <b>proppants</b> is crucial for oil & gas production. Therefore, the prospect of application of carbon nanotubes was explored in the present work for the development of <b>proppants</b> particles. The <b>proppants</b> testing was carried out with N 2 Physiosrption, xrd, density measurement, treating with the 12 : 3 HCl:HF solution and Instron strength testing. The <b>proppants</b> testing results showed excellent properties for ceramics <b>proppants</b> but the performance of sand <b>proppants</b> was very poor. The poor performance of sand <b>proppants</b> attracted motivation for the application of carbon nanotubes to improve the properties of sand <b>proppants.</b> The Chemical Vapor Deposition method was used for the growth of carbon nanotubes around the surface of sand particles. The testing of CNTs grown <b>proppants</b> was carried out for analysis of improvements in the properties of <b>proppants.</b> There ware no observable improvements in sphericity and strength of the sand with the coating of carbon nanotubes. There was decrease in density of CNTs sand particles which was considered to be an improvement. The increase in surface area with CNTs grown sand was motivation for development of multifunctional <b>proppants</b> to be used as vehicle for chemical delivery in the reservoir. The multifunctional prospect of the CNTs sand <b>proppants</b> was explored with the adsorption of phosphonates scale inhibitor {{on the surface of the}} CNTs sand particle. The results presented an increase in phosphonates loading with the increase in CNTs yield and reaction time which is considered to be and indication that the application of CNTs can provide breakthrough in the development of multi purpose <b>proppants.</b> So, the carbon nanotubes has potential to find applications for development of <b>proppants...</b>|$|R

50|$|Hydraulic {{fracturing}} uses abundant {{amounts of}} {{sand in the}} process of fracturing as part of the hydraulic fluid. The fracturing fluid consists of a base fluid, <b>proppant</b> and chemical additives. The majority of <b>proppant</b> used in fracturing are made of silica (sand). Truck loads of sand are delivered to the sites, then loaded to sand movers that are then transferred to a blender that mixes the hydraulic fluid. The hydraulic fluid is injected at high pressure into the fracture. The <b>proppant</b> keeps the fracture open to allow more oil and gas to be extracted out.|$|E
50|$|The main {{purposes}} of fracturing fluid are to extend fractures, add lubrication, change gel strength, and to carry <b>proppant</b> into the formation. There are two methods of transporting <b>proppant</b> in the fluidhigh-rate and high-viscosity. High-viscosity fracturing tends to cause large dominant fractures, while high-rate (slickwater) fracturing causes small spread-out micro-fractures.|$|E

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, gellan gum has the {{potential}} to serve as additive for fracturing fluid. During hydraulic fracturing operations, fracturing fluid (brine) carrying <b>proppants</b> is injected into wells. At low injection velocity (hence low shear rate), the fracturing fluid must maintain a high viscosity and yield point to effectively suspend and transport <b>proppants.</b> At high injection velocity (and high shear rate), the fracturing fluid should demonstrate low viscosity to reduce unnecessary pressure loss. After injection, the fracturing fluid should flow back easily and leave the <b>proppants</b> in the fracture.|$|R
40|$|AbstractCeramic <b>proppants</b> are {{classified}} as propping agents commonly used for the shale gas industry. Fractures created in shale deposits due to high fluid pressure (hydraulic fracturing) have to be propped allowing unconventional gas migration to a borehole. Ceramic granules located in the newly created fissures act as a prop so that the shale gas can flow up the well. It occurs if the <b>proppants</b> can resist the huge forces of the closing fractures at high temperature. Due to these strict geological conditions and processing requirements the <b>proppants</b> have to be characterized by proper physico- mechanical properties. The aim {{of this research was}} to study, compare and select the ceramic <b>proppants</b> characterized by the most appropriate parameters. The investigation relates to the industrial granules obtained by the mechanical granulation method and afterwards sintered which were confronted and analyzed. Utility of the <b>proppants</b> was estimated basing on bulk density and roundness coefficient. Structure, morphology and chemical composition of the samples were determined by the Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS). The sintered <b>proppants</b> were also characterized with X-Ray Tomography, turbidity and solubility in acid additionally. The crucial parameter as mechanical strength was established during the propping samples subjection to the crush tests. The obtained outcomes prove that chemical composition, pores distribution, grain size and mechanical strength influence the integrity of created fractures and therefore the extraction of the unconventional gas out of the well...|$|R

5000|$|Hydraulic {{fracturing}} (also fracking, fraccing, frac'ing, hydrofracturing or hydrofracking) {{is a well}} stimulation {{technique in}} which rock is fractured by a pressurized liquid. The process involves the high-pressure injection of 'fracking fluid' (primarily water, containing sand or other <b>proppants</b> suspended {{with the aid of}} thickening agents) into a wellbore to create cracks in the deep-rock formations through which natural gas, petroleum, and brine will flow more freely. When the hydraulic pressure is removed from the well, small grains of hydraulic fracturing <b>proppants</b> (either sand or aluminium oxide) hold the fractures open.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Proppant</b> {{mesh size}} also affects {{fracture}} length: proppants can be [...] "bridged out" [...] if the fracture width decreases {{to less than}} {{twice the size of}} the diameter of the <b>proppant.</b> As proppants are deposited in a fracture, proppants can resist further fluid flow or the flow of other proppants, inhibiting further growth of the fracture. In addition, closure stresses (once external fluid pressure is released) may cause proppants to reorganise or [...] "squeeze out" [...] proppants, even if no fines are generated, resulting in smaller effective width of the fracture and decreased permeability. Some companies try to cause weak bonding at rest between <b>proppant</b> particles in order to prevent such reorganisation. The modelling of fluid dynamics and rheology of fracturing fluid and its carried proppants is a subject of active research by the industry.|$|E
50|$|Fracking {{entails the}} pumping of sand-laden fluids into an oil or natural gas {{reservoir}} {{at a high}} pressure and flow rate. This cracks the reservoir rock and then propels the cracks open. Water alone is too thin to be effective at carrying <b>proppant</b> sand, so guar gum {{is one of the}} ingredients added to thicken the slurry mixture and improve its ability to carry <b>proppant.</b> There are several properties which are important 1. Thixotropic: the fluid should be thixotropic, meaning it should gel within few hours.2. Gelling and degelling: The desired viscosity changes {{over the course of a}} few hours. When the fracking slurry is mixed, it needs to be thin enough to make it easier to pump. Then as it flows down the pipe, the fluid needs to gel up to support the <b>proppant</b> and flush it deep into the fractures. After that process, the gel has to break down so we can flow back and recover the fracking fluid, but leave the <b>proppant</b> behind. This requires a chemical process which produces then breaks the gel cross-linking at a predictable rate. Guar+boron+proprietary chemicals can accomplish both of these goals at once.|$|E
50|$|For both low {{and high}} volume {{hydraulic}} fracturing stimulation of a hydrocarbon well, a high-pressure fluid (usually water) containing chemical additives and a <b>proppant</b> is injected into a wellbore to create an extensive system of small cracks in the deep-rock formations. These cracks provide the pathway for: natural gas, (including shale gas, tight gas and coalbed methane); petroleum, (including shale or tight oil); to flow more freely. When the hydraulic pressure {{is removed from the}} well, the small grains of hydraulic fracturing <b>proppant</b> hold the fractures open when the pressure is released.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a method of converting drill cuttings from gas shale wells into high strength <b>proppants</b> via flame spheroidization and devitrification processing. Conversion of drill cuttings to spherical particles was only possible for small particle sizes (< 53 {micro}m) using a flame former after a homogenizing melting step. This size limitation is likely to be impractical for application as conventional <b>proppants</b> due to particle packing characteristics. In an attempt to overcome the particle size limitation, sodium and calcium were added to the drill cuttings to act as fluxes during the spheroidization process. However, the flame former remained unable to form spheres from the fluxed material at the relatively large diameters (0. 5 - 2 mm) targeted for <b>proppants.</b> For future work, the flame former could be modified to operate at higher temperature or longer residence time in order to produce larger, spherical materials. Post spheroidization heat treatments should be investigated to tailor the final phase assemblage for high strength and sufficient chemical durability...|$|R

50|$|In 1973, Amoco {{introduced}} massive {{hydraulic fracturing}} to the Wattenberg Gas Field of the Denver Basin of Colorado, to recover gas from the low-permeability J Sandstone.

In 1974, Amoco performed the first million-pound frac job, injecting {{more than a million}} pounds of <b>proppant</b> into the J Sand of a well in Wattenberg Field.|$|E
50|$|For {{slickwater}} fluids {{the use of}} sweeps is common. Sweeps are temporary {{reductions in}} the <b>proppant</b> concentration, which help ensure that the well is not overwhelmed with <b>proppant.</b> As the fracturing process proceeds, viscosity-reducing agents such as oxidizers and enzyme breakers are sometimes added to the fracturing fluid to deactivate the gelling agents and encourage flowback. Such oxidizer react with and break down the gel, reducing the fluid's viscosity and ensuring that no <b>proppant</b> is pulled from the formation. An enzyme acts {{as a catalyst for}} breaking down the gel. Sometimes pH modifiers are used to break down the crosslink {{at the end of a}} hydraulic fracturing job, since many require a pH buffer system to stay viscous. At the end of the job, the well is commonly flushed with water under pressure (sometimes blended with a friction reducing chemical.) Some (but not all) injected fluid is recovered. This fluid is managed by several methods, including underground injection control, treatment, discharge, recycling, and temporary storage in pits or containers. New technology is continually developing to better handle waste water and improve re-usability.|$|E
50|$|Increased {{strength}} {{often comes}} {{at a cost of}} increased density, which in turn demands higher flow rates, viscosities or pressures during fracturing, which translates to increased fracturing costs, both environmentally and economically. Lightweight proppants conversely are designed to be lighter than sand (~2.5 g/cm3) and thus allow pumping at lower pressures or fluid velocities. Light proppants are less likely to settle. Porous materials can break the strength-density trend, or even afford greater gas permeability. <b>Proppant</b> geometry is also important; certain shapes or forms amplify stress on <b>proppant</b> particles making them especially vulnerable to crushing (a sharp discontinuity can classically allow infinite stresses in linear elastic materials).|$|E

5000|$|Though sand is {{a common}} <b>proppant,</b> {{untreated}} sand is prone to significant fines generation; fines generation is often measured in wt% of initial feed. A commercial newsletter from Momentive cites untreated sand fines production to be 23.9% compared with 8.2% for lightweight ceramic and 0.5% for their product. [...] One way to maintain an ideal mesh size (i.e. permeability) while having sufficient strength is to choose proppants of sufficient strength; sand might be coated with resin,to form CRCS (Curable Resin Coated Sand) or PRCS (Pre-Cured Resin Coated Sands).

30|$|Particle {{suspensions}} in fluids {{are used}} in various aspects of petroleum production. These include drilling muds in wells and <b>proppants</b> in fractures. The latter category includes a number of options for various stages of the production process. Currently the best known application is in unconventional gas where the role of particles is to keep fractures open following high-pressure hydraulic fracturing. In oil recovery the problem is pre-existing rather than stimulated fractures, which provide a high conductivity path for secondary production injected water to break through to the producer well. This limits the amount of oil that can be swept in the permeable matrix. In this case <b>proppants</b> are used to reduce leak-off via fractures.
