2500|$|Facebook {{launched}} the Facebook Platform on May 24, 2007, providing {{a framework for}} software developers to create applications that interact with core Facebook's features. A markup language called Facebook Markup Language was introduced simultaneously; {{it is used to}} customize the [...] "look and feel" [...] of applications that developers create. Using the Platform, Facebook launched several new applications, including Gifts, allowing users to send virtual gifts to each other, Marketplace, allowing users to <b>post</b> <b>free</b> classified ads, Events, giving users a method of informing their friends about upcoming events, Video, letting users share homemade videos with one another, and social network game, where users can use their connections to friends to help them advance in games they are playing. [...] Many of the popular early social network games would combine capabilities. [...] For instance, one of the early games to reach the top application spot, (Lil) Green Patch, combined virtual Gifts with Event notifications to friends and contributions to charities through Causes.|$|E

60|$|They {{say that}} when great men arise they have a mission to {{accomplish}} and do not disappear until it is fulfilled. Yet {{this is not always}} true. After all his deep study and his daring action Mr. Hampden died on an obscure field, almost before the commencement of that mighty struggle which he seemed born to direct. In the great contention between the patriotic and the cosmopolitan principle which has hardly begun, and on the issue of which the fate of this island as a powerful community depends, Lord George Ben-tinck appeared to be produced to represent the traditionary influences of our country in their most captivating form. Born a natural leader of the people, he was equal to the <b>post.</b> <b>Free</b> from prejudices, his large mind sympathized with all classes of the realm. His courage and his constancy were never surpassed by man. He valued life only as a means of fulfilling duty, and truly it may be said of him, that he feared none but God.|$|E

50|$|A post {{card system}} of {{communication}} to the UK (via the Red Cross) and the Channel Islands (via German “Feldpost” {{addressed to the}} “Kanal Inseln”) started in October 1942. Internees were allowed three lettersheets and four postcards a month. Lettersheets could contain as many words as could be fit on the page, very different to ordinary POW’s. Each main camp had its censors, Wurzach using Biberach censors. Laufen produced printed Christmas postcards with a drawing of {{the outside of the}} Schloss (1943) and in the vaulted canteen (1944). Trunks of clothing and goods, left in the Islands arrived in the camps, fairly intact. Individual parcels up to 5 kg in weight could be sent to camps <b>post</b> <b>free,</b> however tobacco in them tended to vanish. The Red Cross also supplied some clothing.|$|E

50|$|Carr {{was offered}} an advance of £5,000 for the novel, {{including}} paperback rights, but {{as this was}} the same amount that he had been offered three years earlier for The Battle of Pollocks Crossing, he decided to publish it himself. The book was published in an edition of 2,850 copies and is the first novel published by The Quince Tree Press. As Carr usually offered to send his books <b>post</b> <b>free,</b> he included the price of postage in the price of the book, which had to be printed on the back. However he based postage mistakenly on the cost of sending a Penguin paperback, and What Hetty Did was printed on superior paper with card covers, so it was heavier than expected and he lost money on postage. However the book sold well at £3.95 a copy and he soon had another 3,000 copies printed. The novel is still published by The Quince Tree Press.|$|E

5000|$|When [...] "Deal Or No Deal" [...] began, viewers {{were invited}} to phone in (at premium rate), use the Channel 4 website or enter by <b>post</b> (<b>free</b> of charge) to enter the competition, in which an {{audience}} member selects one of three boxes (coloured blue and separate from the boxes used in the main game), and a selected entrant wins {{the amount of money}} displayed in that box. The amounts on offer in the competition varied from day to day, but typically comprised two amounts in the low thousands of pounds and a top prize of £10,000 or more. On rare occasions, a match play competition had been run in which the winning entrant received the same amount as the studio contestant instead of a prize being selected from the blue viewers' boxes; this once caused a viewer to win £70,000. Entry was open {{from the beginning of the}} second part of the show, when the winning box is chosen, to noon the next day, with the winner revealed at the beginning of the show seven days later.|$|E

5000|$|With {{independence}} {{had come}} {{the consciousness of}} a great destiny. The collective spirit aroused by the war, though clouded by conflicting local difficulties, was intense, and the principal interest of the newspapers {{was to create a}} nation out of the loose confederation. Business and commerce were their next care; but in an effort to {{be all things to all}} men, the small page included a little of whatever might [...] "interest, instruct, or amuse." [...] Political intelligence occupied first place; news, in the modern sense, was subordinated. A new idea, quite as much as a fire, a murder, or a prodigy, was a matter of news moment. There were always a few items of local interest, usually placed with paragraphs of editorial miscellany. Correspondents, in return for the paper, sent items; private letters, often no doubt written with a view to such use, were a fruitful source of news; but the chief resource was the newspapers that every office received as exchanges, carried in the <b>post</b> <b>free</b> of charge, and the newspapers from abroad.|$|E
