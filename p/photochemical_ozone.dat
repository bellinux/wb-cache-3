40|$|International audienceResults from a tropospheric {{three-dimensional}} {{chemical transport}} model (TOMCAT) {{have been used}} to examine the terms of the ozone budget, both regionally and globally. The global calculations are discussed in light of other published estimates. Regional budgets are calculated for continental regions, including the American Mid-West, Sahara, and central Europe. These are compared with regional budgets for oceanic regions, including the Azores High and the Tropical Pacific Warm Pool. Furthermore, the coastal region of the UK and Ireland is also considered. The validity of these regional budgets from TOMCAT are discussed by comparing TOMCAT with measurements from a number of aircraft campaigns. The budgets for central Europe and the American Mid-West indicate that continental regions dominate the ozone budget of the northern extratropics. This is in spite of the remote oceanic regions being <b>photochemical</b> sinks for <b>ozone.</b> The regional budget calculations for the UK and Ireland exhibit net <b>photochemical</b> production of <b>ozone</b> in the boundary layer but this is not consistent with available aircraft measurements. This is attributed to the coarse horizontal resolution of the TOMCAT model which results in the model's photochemical budget being more typical of a polluted continental region than a relatively remote one.

Ozone affected by the other air pollutants, so this paper attempt to study the relationship between hourly, daily and monthly ground-level ozone concentration and hourly, daily and monthly air pollutant concentrations and its effect on ground-level ozone concentration. The other air pollutants are: sulfur dioxide SO 2, nitrogen oxides NOx, nitrogen monoxide NO, nitrogen dioxide NO 2 and carbon dioxide CO 2. The monitoring station is in Babylon University in the south of Al-Hilla city, Iraq for the period 2015 - 2016. By using statistical analysis, correlation coefficient and some statistics for all air pollutants are computed. Results are: the maximum average ozone concentration is in the summer months June, July and August 39. 30 ppb, 45. 05 ppb and 36. 63 ppb respectively and along the day the peak average ozone concentration is in the afternoon because of high temperature and high solar radiation intensity which is increasing the <b>photochemical</b> activity of <b>ozone.</b> There is no significant correlation between ozone and sulfur dioxide SO 2, carbon dioxide CO 2 (ρ > 0. 05).

Ozone is formed as a part of <b>photochemical</b> smog from <b>ozone</b> precursors by <b>photochemical</b> reactions. As <b>ozone</b> precursors nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOC) are called. Their main source is car traffic. Danger of ozone lies in its reactivity. It oxidizes most of organic compounds, especially those containing double bonds. These are present in membrane lipids. Furthermore, ozone forms more reactive compounds than itself - active oxygen species (AOS), free radicals. Ozone effects negatively both human health and vegetation. Ozone disrupts structure of the cells, which for plants means destroy of leaves and needles, photosynthesis disruption and biomass loss. For that, plants have antioxidants system for AOS scavenging. But it has little effect, when concentration of ozone is high during smog period. Therefore, limits for maximal concentration of ozone in the ambient air are set...|$|R

In a captive air experiment, ambient air is introduced in a Teflon chamber and exposed to sunlight for several hours, thus allowing photochemical reactions to take place under "real-world" conditions. Parameters measured in six experiments, the first of their kind to be carried out in Brazil, included oxides of nitrogen (NO and NO 2), carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, ca. 75 non-methane hydrocarbons, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, ethanol, MTBE, and the <b>photochemical</b> oxidants <b>ozone</b> and peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN). Photochemical conversion of NO to NO 2 and <b>photochemical</b> production of <b>ozone</b> (maximum concentrations 156 - 348 ppb) and PAN (maximum 13. 3 - 29. 5 ppb) were observed in all experiments, together with net (formation minus removal) photochemical production of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde.

At high NO x conditions (BVOC/NO x x > 23 ppb) no new particles were formed. Instead <b>photochemical</b> <b>ozone</b> formation was observed resulting in higher hydroxyl radical (OH) and lower nitrogen monoxide (NO) concentrations. As soon as [NO] was reduced to below 1 ppb by OH reactions, NPF was observed. Adding high amounts of NO x caused NPF orders of magnitude slower than in analogous experiments at low NO x conditions (NO x ~ 300 ppt), although OH concentrations were higher. Varying NO 2 photolysis enabled showing that NO was responsible for suppression of NPF suggesting that peroxy radicals are involved in NPF. The rates of NPF and <b>photochemical</b> <b>ozone</b> production were related by power law dependence with an exponent of approximately − 2. This exponent indicated that the overall peroxy radical concentration {{must have been the}} same whenever NPF appeared. Thus permutation reactions of first generation peroxy radicals cannot be the rate limiting step in NPF from monoterpene oxidation. It was concluded that permutation reactions of higher generation peroxy radical like molecules limit the rate of new particle formation. In contrast to the strong effects on the particle numbers, the formation of particle mass was less sensitive to NO x concentrations, if at all.
