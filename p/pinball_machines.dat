5|$|In August 1972, Bushnell and Alcorn {{installed}} the Pong prototype {{at a local}} bar, Andy Capp's Tavern. They selected the bar because of their good working relation with the bar's manager, Bill Gaddis; Atari supplied <b>pinball</b> <b>machines</b> to Gaddis. Bushnell and Alcorn placed the prototype {{on one of the}} tables near the other entertainment machines: a jukebox, <b>pinball</b> <b>machines,</b> and Computer Space. The game was well received the first night and its popularity continued to grow over the next one and a half weeks. Bushnell then went on a business trip to Chicago to demonstrate Pong to executives at Bally and Midway Manufacturing; he intended to use Pong to fulfill his contract with Bally, rather than the driving game. A few days later, the prototype began exhibiting technical issues and Gaddis contacted Alcorn to fix it. Upon inspecting the machine, Alcorn discovered that the problem was the coin mechanism was overflowing with quarters.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons is an American {{animated}} television sitcom {{created by}} Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series is a satirical parody {{of a middle}} class American lifestyle epitomized by its eponymous family, which consists of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie. It {{is set in the}} fictional town of Springfield, and lampoons American culture, society and television, and many aspects of the human condition. The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a pitch for a series of animated shorts with producer James L.Brooks. Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family, substituting Bart for his own name. The shorts became a part of The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987 and after a three-season run, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and became a hit series for Fox. The growing popularity of the series motivated video game developers to create video games based on the series. Two <b>pinball</b> <b>machines</b> have also been produced; one self-titled, that was only made available for a limited time after the first season finale (1990) and The Simpsons Pinball Party (2003). Additionally, several handheld device games have been released, such as Bartman: Avenger of Evil (1990) and Bart Simpson's Cupcake Crisis (1991).|$|E

25|$|The {{video game}} {{boom of the}} 1980s {{signaled}} {{the end of the}} boom for pinball. Arcades replaced rows of <b>pinball</b> <b>machines</b> with video games like 1978's Space Invaders, 1979's Asteroids, 1980's Pac-Man, and 1981's Galaga. These earned significantly greater profits than the <b>pinball</b> <b>machines</b> of the day, while simultaneously requiring less maintenance. Bally, Williams, and Gottlieb continued to make <b>pinball</b> <b>machines,</b> while they also manufactured video games in much higher numbers. Many of the larger companies were acquired by, or merged with, other companies. Chicago Coin was purchased by the Stern family, who brought the company into the digital era as Stern Enterprises, which closed its doors in the mid-1980s. Bally exited the pinball business in 1988 and sold their assets to Williams, who subsequently used the Bally trademark from then on for about half of their pinball releases.|$|E

50|$|Centaur is a <b>pinball</b> <b>machine</b> {{designed}} by Jim Patla and produced by Bally. The game {{was inspired by}} the classic Bally's 1956 Balls-A-Poppin that was the first flipper <b>pinball</b> <b>machine</b> with multiball. Because of its success, the <b>pinball</b> <b>machine</b> was re-released in 1983 as Centaur II. The re-release has only a different backbox and was otherwise unchanged.|$|R
25|$|Historically, <b>pinball</b> <b>machines</b> have {{employed}} a central fixed I/O board {{connected to the}} primary CPU controlled by a custom microcontroller platform running an in-house operating system. For {{a variety of reasons}} that include thermal flow, reliability, vibration reduction and serviceability, I/O electronics have been located in the upper backbox of the game, requiring significant custom wiring harnesses to connect the central I/O board to the playfield devices.|$|E
25|$|Pinball scoring can be {{peculiar}} and varies {{greatly from}} machine to machine. During the 1930s and the 1940s, lights mounted behind the painted backglasses {{were used for}} scoring purposes, making the scoring somewhat arbitrary. (Frequently the lights represented scores {{in the hundreds of}} thousands.) Then later, during the 1950s and 1960s when the scoring mechanism was limited to mechanical wheels, high scores were frequently only in the hundreds or thousands. (Although, {{in an effort to keep}} with the traditional high scores attained with the painted backglass games, the first <b>pinball</b> <b>machines</b> to use mechanical wheels for scoring, such as Army Navy, allowed the score to reach into the millions by adding a number of permanent zeros to the end of the score.) The average score changed again in the 1970s with the advent of electronic displays. Average scores soon began to commonly increase back into tens or hundreds of thousands. Since then, there has been a trend of scoring inflation, with modern machines often requiring scores of over a billion points to win a free game. At the peak of this trend, two machines, Johnny Mnemonic and Attack from Mars, have been played into the trillions. Another recent curiosity is the 1997 Bally game NBA Fastbreak which, true to its theme, awards points in terms of a real basketball score: Each successful shot can give from one to three points. Getting a hundred points by the end of a game is considered respectable, which makes it one of the lowest scoring <b>pinball</b> <b>machines</b> of all time. The inflated scores are the source of one of the Spanish-language names of <b>pinball</b> <b>machines,</b> m√°quina del mill√≥n ("million machine").|$|E
25|$|Early <b>pinball</b> <b>machines</b> {{typically}} had full solenoid current {{passing through}} trigger switches {{for all types}} of solenoids, from kickers to pop bumpers to the flippers themselves. This caused arcing across switch contacts and rapid contact fouling and failure. As electronics were gradually implemented in pinball design, solenoids began to be switched by power transistors under software control to lower switch voltage and current, vastly extend switch service lifetime, and add flexibility to game design.|$|E

25|$|Jacob Harris was a {{supplier}} of amusement machines whose solicitor also acted for Stanley. The solicitor had originally met Stanley through serving a bankruptcy notice {{on him and}} had ended up as his attorney. The original debtor never got paid. Stanley boasted of his surplus import licenses and the solicitor advised Harris whom he knew wanted to import <b>pinball</b> <b>machines.</b> In July 1948, Harris approached fellow supplier Francis Price with a proposal that they meet with Stanley. Stanley claimed that he could bribe Belcher and Financial Secretary to the Treasury Glenvil Hall to obtain licenses. After canvassing some commercial and political confidantes, Price contacted the police. Press speculation intensified.|$|E
25|$|Contact with or {{manipulation}} of scoring elements (such as targets or ramps) scores {{points for the}} player. Electrical switches embedded in the scoring elements detect contact and relay this information to the scoring mechanism. Older <b>pinball</b> <b>machines</b> used an electromechanical system for scoring wherein a pulse from a switch would cause a complex mechanism composed of relays to ratchet up the score. In later games these tasks have {{been taken over by}} semiconductor chips and displays are made on electronic segmented or dot-matrix displays (DMD). The first DMD on a pinball machine was used by Checkpoint and features also video mode minigames. MarsaPlay in Spain manufactured a remake of Inder's original Canasta titled New Canasta, with an LCD screen in the backbox in 2010. The Wizard of Oz is the first US pinball machine that used a LCD in the back box. It is not only used for scoring and mini-games but also to display full color videos. Other display innovations on <b>pinball</b> <b>machines</b> include pinball video game hybrids like Baby Pac-Man in 1982 and Granny and the Gators in 1984 and the use of a small color video monitor for scoring and minigames in the backbox of the pinball machine Dakar from manufacturer Mr. Game in 1988 and CGA color monitors in Pinball 2000 in 1999 that utilizes a Pepper's Ghost technique to reflect the monitor in the head of the as well as modifications by the use of ColorDMD that is used to replace the standard mono color DMDs.|$|E
