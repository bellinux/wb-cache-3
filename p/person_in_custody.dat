2500|$|The U.S. Supreme Court {{had held}} {{previously}} in Edwards v. Arizona, , that an accused <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>custody</b> who has, [...] "expressed {{his desire to}} deal with the police only through counsel is not subject to further interrogation by the authorities until counsel has been made available to him, unless the accused himself initiates further communication, exchanges, or conversations with the police." ...|$|E
2500|$|When used {{in print}} {{or as the}} battle cry in a black power rally, police {{brutality}} can by implication cover a number of practices, from calling a citizen {{by his or her}} first name to a death by a policeman's bullet. What the average citizen thinks of when he hears the term, however, is something midway between these two occurrences, something more akin to what the police profession knows as [...] "alley court"—the wanton vicious beating of a <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>custody,</b> usually while handcuffed, and usually taking place somewhere between the scene of the arrest and the station house.|$|E
50|$|The Concept {{stipulates}} compulsory social/pedagogical {{support and}} social and psychological aid for the convicts and <b>persons</b> <b>in</b> <b>custody.</b> Keeping <b>in</b> mind that the <b>persons</b> <b>in</b> <b>custody</b> are not considered guilty of a felony prior to the court’s verdict, it is unclear, how a compulsory social/pedagogical support shall be enforced with regards to these persons.|$|R

50|$|There are {{particular}} duties of care owed to <b>persons</b> <b>in</b> <b>custody</b> (s. 2(1)(d)) and, {{owing to the}} sensitivity and difficulty of such duties, implementation of this section was delayed.

2500|$|A writ of {{habeas corpus}} is a legal action against {{unlawful}} detainment that commands a law enforcement agency or other body that has a <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>custody</b> to have a court inquire into {{the legality of the}} detention. The court may order the person released if the reason for detention is deemed insufficient or unjustifiable. The Constitution further provides that the privilege of the writ {{of habeas corpus}} may not be suspended [...] "unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it". In Ex parte Milligan (1866), the Supreme Court ruled that the suspension of habeas corpus {{in a time of war}} was lawful, but military tribunals did not apply to citizens in states that had upheld the authority of the Constitution and where civilian courts were still operating.|$|E
2500|$|Issuance of a writ is an {{exercise}} of an extraordinary jurisdiction of the superior courts in Pakistan. A writ of habeas corpus may be issued by any High Court of a province in Pakistan. Article 199 of the 1973 Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, specifically provides for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, empowering the courts to exercise this prerogative. Subject to the Article 199 of the Constitution, [...] "A High Court may, if it is satisfied that no other adequate remedy is provided by law, on the application of any person, make an order that a <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>custody</b> within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court be brought before {{it so that the}} Court may satisfy itself that he is not being held in custody without a lawful authority or in an unlawful manner". The hallmark of extraordinary constitutional jurisdiction is to keep various functionaries of State within the ambit of their authority. Once a High Court has assumed jurisdiction to adjudicate the matter before it, justiciability of the issue raised before it is beyond question. The Supreme Court of Pakistan has stated clearly that the use of words [...] "in an unlawful manner" [...] implies that the court may examine, if a statute has allowed such detention, whether it was a colorable exercise of the power of authority. Thus, the court can examine the malafides of the action taken.|$|E

50|$|A death <b>in</b> <b>custody</b> is a {{death of}} a <b>person</b> <b>in</b> the <b>custody</b> of the police, prison service or other authorities.
