5|$|As of 2014, {{there have}} been 23 laureates {{affiliated}} with Washington University in St. Louis. Washington University considers laureates who attended the university as undergraduate students, graduate students or {{were members of the}} faculty as affiliated laureates. Arthur Compton, the chancellor of the university from 1945 to 1953, was the first laureate affiliated with the university, winning the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1927. Four Nobel Prizes were shared by Washington University laureates; Joseph Erlanger and Herbert Spencer Gasser won the 1944 Nobel Prize in <b>Physiology</b> or Medicine, Carl Ferdinand Cori and wife Gerty Cori won the 1947 Nobel Prize in <b>Physiology</b> or Medicine, Arthur Kornberg and Severo Ochoa won the 1959 Nobel Prize in <b>Physiology</b> or Medicine, and Daniel Nathans and George Davis Snell won the 1980 Nobel Prize in <b>Physiology</b> or Medicine. Seventeen Washington University laureates have won the Nobel Prize in <b>Physiology</b> or Medicine, more than any other category. With the exception of Daniel Nathans, who received his M.D. from Washington University and William E. Moerner who received his undergraduate degrees from the university, all Washington University laureates have been members of the university faculty.|$|E

5|$|Some {{knowledge}} of <b>physiology</b> and {{the physics of}} diving is considered necessary by most diver certification agencies, as the diving environment is alien and relatively hostile to humans. The physics and <b>physiology</b> knowledge required is fairly basic, and helps the diver to understand {{the effects of the}} diving environment so that informed acceptance of the associated risks is possible. The physics mostly relates to gases under pressure, buoyancy, heat loss, and light underwater. The <b>physiology</b> relates the physics to the effects on the human body, to provide a basic understanding of the causes and risks of barotrauma, DCS, gas toxicity, hypothermia, drowning and sensory variations. More advanced training often involves first aid and rescue skills, skills related to specialised diving equipment, and underwater work skills. Further training is required to develop the skills necessary for diving in a wider range of environments, with specialised equipment, and to become competent to perform a variety of underwater tasks.|$|E
5|$|The MAM is a {{critical}} signaling, metabolic, and trafficking hub in the cell that allows for the integration of ER and mitochondrial <b>physiology.</b> Coupling between these organelles is not simply structural but functional as well and critical for overall cellular <b>physiology</b> and homeostasis. The MAM thus offers a perspective on mitochondria that diverges from the traditional view of this organelle as a static, isolated unit appropriated for its metabolic capacity by the cell. Instead, this mitochondrial-ER interface emphasizes {{the integration of the}} mitochondria, the product of an endosymbiotic event, into diverse cellular processes.|$|E

5|$|The {{riddle of}} water and {{nutrient}} transport through the plant remained. Physiologist Von Mohl explored solute transport and the theory of water uptake by the roots using the concepts of cohesion, transpirational pull, capillarity and root pressure. German dominance {{in the field of}} <b>physiology</b> was underlined by the publication of the definitive textbook on plant <b>physiology</b> synthesising the work of this period, Sach's e of 1882. There were, however, some advances elsewhere such as the early exploration of geotropism (the effect of gravity on growth) by Englishman Thomas Knight, and the discovery and naming of osmosis by Frenchman Henri Dutrochet (1776–1847).|$|E
5|$|The work {{is divided}} into 37 books, {{organised}} into ten volumes.

5|$|Although {{no family}} matches the Curie family's record, {{there have been}} several with two laureates. The husband-and-wife team of Gerty Cori and Carl Ferdinand Cori shared the 1947 Prize in <b>Physiology</b> or Medicine as did the husband-and-wife team of May-Britt Moser and Edvard Moser in 2014 (along with John O'Keefe). J. J. Thomson was awarded the Physics Prize in 1906 for showing that {{electrons}} are particles. His son, George Paget Thomson, received the same prize in 1937 for showing that they also have the properties of waves. William Henry Bragg and his son, William Lawrence Bragg, shared the Physics Prize in 1915 for inventing the X-ray spectrometer. Niels Bohr was awarded the Physics prize in 1922, as did his son, Aage Bohr, in 1975. Manne Siegbahn, who received the Physics Prize in 1924, was the father of Kai Siegbahn, who received the Physics Prize in 1981. Hans von Euler-Chelpin, who received the Chemistry Prize in 1929, was the father of Ulf von Euler, who was awarded the <b>Physiology</b> or Medicine Prize in 1970. C. V. Raman was awarded the Physics Prize in 1930 and was the uncle of Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, who was awarded the same prize in 1983. Arthur Kornberg received the <b>Physiology</b> or Medicine Prize in 1959; Kornberg's son, Roger later received the Chemistry Prize in 2006. Jan Tinbergen, who was awarded the first Economics Prize in 1969, was the brother of Nikolaas Tinbergen, who received the 1973 <b>Physiology</b> or Medicine Prize. Alva Myrdal, Peace Prize laureate in 1982, was the wife of Gunnar Myrdal who was awarded the Economics Prize in 1974. Economics laureates Paul Samuelson and Kenneth Arrow were brothers-in-law. Frits Zernike, who was awarded the 1953 Physics Prize, is the great-uncle of 1999 Physics laureate Gerard 't Hooft.|$|E
40|$|Type 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus (T 2 DM), like all chronic diseases, results from interactions between multiple genes and multiple environmental factors. Nevertheless, many research studies focus on either nutrition or genetic factors independently of each other. The challenges of analyzing gene–nutrient interactions in T 2 DM are the (i) genetic heterogeneity in humans, (ii) complexity of environmental factors, particularly dietary chemicals, and (iii) diverse <b>physiologies</b> that {{produce the same}} apparent disease. Many of these variables are not accounted for in the design or study of T 2 DM or, indeed, most chronic diseases, although exceptions are noteworthy. Establishing experimental paradigms to analyze the complexity of these interactions and <b>physiologies</b> is challenging, but possible. This article provides a strategy to extend nutrigenomic experimental strategies to include early environmental influences that may promote adult-onset disease...|$|R

5|$|Animals {{adapted to}} live in deserts are called xerocoles. There is no {{evidence}} that body temperature of mammals and birds is adaptive to the different climates, either of great heat or cold. In fact, with a very few exceptions, their basal metabolic rate is determined by body size, irrespective of the climate in which they live. Many desert animals (and plants) show especially clear evolutionary adaptations for water conservation or heat tolerance and so are often studied in comparative <b>physiology,</b> ecophysiology, and evolutionary <b>physiology.</b> One well-studied example is the specializations of mammalian kidneys shown by desert-inhabiting species. Many examples of convergent evolution have been identified in desert organisms, including between cacti and Euphorbia, kangaroo rats and jerboas, Phrynosoma and Moloch lizards.|$|E

Human sustainability can be achieved by attaining sustainability in all levels of the seven modalities.|$|E
5|$|As of 2014, {{there have}} been 13 Nobel laureates {{affiliated}} with the City University of New York (CUNY). CUNY considers any laureate who attended one of its senior colleges as an affiliated laureate. Arthur Kornberg, who graduated from the City College of New York, a senior college of CUNY, in 1937, was the first CUNY laureate, winning the Nobel Prize in <b>Physiology</b> or Medicine in 1959. Herbert A. Hauptman and Jerome Karle, both of whom graduated from the City College in 1937 with Kornberg, jointly won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1985, the only CUNY laureates to do so. Six CUNY laureates have won the Nobel Prize in <b>Physiology</b> or Medicine, {{more than any other}} category. Ten of the CUNY laureates graduated from the City College, two laureates, Rosalyn Sussman Yalow and Gertrude B.
