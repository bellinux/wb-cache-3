It is reviewed the initial content of the theory of non-Walrasian equilibrium and emphasizes the main modelling factors of the respective equilibrium. It proposes the inclusion of the capital market in the model of non-Walrasian equilibrium and is also reveals the implications of the extension of the respective model to the classification of types of non-Walrasian equilibrium and to the content of macroeconomic and structural policies. Also, it proposes an econometric method for the estimation of the type of unemployment.

The specific literature about the regional inequalities considered the income per capita as the most relevant indicator measured by Gini coefficient.

At regional level we studied several indicators that generate regional disparities, and influence employment quality such us: employment rate, tertiary and medium employment, unemployment rate, occupied population in informal sector, employment in primary sector, rural employment, female employment.

40|$|An {{aspect of}} {{unquestionable}} transcendency {{is the impact}} of the unemployment in the current society. Most part of the countries in the European continent present as from the decade of the 70 's very significant rates of unemployment. The persistence of this characteristic in the occupational market constitutes the most important fact of concern for citizens and governments. The problem of the unemployment becomes much more serious in the case of Spain, and the Galician Autonomous Community is not an exception. The society considers the unemployment as the great plague of the modern times, {{not only because of the}} serious effects that brings about at individual and familiar level, loss of occupational income as relevant factor of the distribution of the revenue, but also at social level by the repercussions on the economic growth, the regional development and the economic inequalities. The magnitude and the complexity of the unemployment can not be analyzed from an only cause, neither so from an economic approach alone, that without doubt would be <b>partial.</b> The <b>unemployment</b> is a complex process affected by many variables, which exceeds the narrow framework of the occupational market and definitively has a lot to do with the location, the demography, the possibility of economic growth and the expansion of final demand. However, due to its transcendency, the economic aspects related to the unemployment, the utilization of the human resources and the generated revenue levels are economic problems of a great relevancy. ...|$|R

During economic downturns when political voltage is high, policy makers look to work sharing as one way to manage job loss. Conversely, work sharing is often forgotten during prosperous times.

The authors discuss work sharing through six policy phases during a thirty-year era of devolving federal authority to states for employment services and job training, and they make observations about the stalemate in federal policy.

40|$|In all European countries, {{emergency}} policy {{measures have}} been introduced in order to counteract the employment consequences of the economic crisis. In the context of variously composed anticrisis packages, many European countries have used Short-Time Work (STW) schemes, that is measures to subsidize a temporary {{reduction in working time}} intended to maintain an employment relationship. Countries which already had STW schemes, such as Kurzarbeit in Germany and Austria and the Cassa Integrazione Guadagni (CIG) in Italy, have loosened the eligibility requirements and extended their maximum duration. This paper focuses on the issue whether the economic crisis has spurred any convergence in the use of STW in these three social-insurance countries - Austria, Germany and Italy - or whether policy change has rather occurred in a path-dependent fashion. In order to do so, the paper also adopts a systemic approach, focusing on relationships of complementarity or functional substitution and equivalence among the various schemes comprising income maintenance systems to tackle the risks of <b>partial</b> or total <b>unemployment.</b> In addition to shedding light on a rather under-researched province of contemporary welfare states such as STW, this article also aims to contribute to the debate on the analytical levels in the study of social policy by showing the relevance and potential of adopting an intermediate level of analysis between a regime-centred and a programme-centred approach. short time work; unemployment compensation; social protection; convergence; path dependenc...|$|R

Against the recommendations of many economists, it decided to maintain its peg and adjust through internal devaluation and front loaded fiscal austerity. Five years later, its proponents see it as a clear success. Its opponents see it if not as a clear failure, at least as an excessively painful adjustment. Witness the recent exchange between Latvia’s prime minister, Valdis Dombrovskis, and Paul Krugman: "Krugman famously said back in December 2008 that Latvia is the new Argentina, it will inevitably go bankrupt, and now he has difficulty apparently admitting he was wrong and so he tries to seek some problems in how Latvia is recovering from the economic crisis […] But I think that the mere fact that {{for the last two years}} we are enjoying rapid growth shows that it was probably the right strategy.

Job displacement insurance is presumably designed to offset these losses, but evidence suggests that consumption smoothing among the long-tenured displaced is seriously incomplete, at least in lightly regulated labor markets. Unemployment and reemployment wage insurance could fully cover these losses, but are costly to provide. Severance pay has emerged as a supplemental, if much criticized, instrument. Moral hazard limitations on unemployment insurance generosity mean that severance pay functions as scheduled (<b>partial)</b> <b>unemployment</b> insurance and scheduled wage insurance.

40|$|The {{economic}} downturn in 2007 {{has led to}} a very spectacular rise in unemployment in some countries, especially concentrated among low educated and young men. Facing this new context, the reactions of labour market policies seem ambiguous. On the one hand, institutional reforms and in work incentives still follow previous reform trends, especially the activation framework. On the other hand, a large number of countries also develop internal flexibility devices (including <b>partial</b> <b>unemployment),</b> and reinforce unemployment insurance or minimum income policies. These types of policies may have contributed to temper the direct impact of the crisis on labour market trends (especially in Continental countries). They also lead to the reintroduction of some old debates (on working time sharing, on the minimum wage), especially in the New Member States.

40|$|Job {{displacement}} in the U. S. is {{a serious}} threat to the earnings of long-tenured workers, through both (i) unemployment spells and (ii) reduced reemployment wages. Although full insurance requires both unemployment benefits and wage insurance, supply difficulties limit actual-loss insurance, and separation packages typically include <b>partial</b> <b>unemployment</b> insurance and scheduled (fixed sum) severance pay. The design of this two dimensional package requires a systems approach as well as a generalized replacement ratio measure of adequacy). Job search moral hazard and layoff moral hazard (firing costs), individually and in combination, introduce potentially serious contracting concerns. Economic theory provides a practical guide to the integration of these insurance instruments in this complex planning environment. One important implication: given the structure of earnings losses at displacement in the U. S., severance pay should increase with length of service in the firm ("tenure"), which is common, and unemployment insurance benefit levels should fall, which is not...|$|E

Seasonal migrations between {{industry}} and agriculture were widespread in France {{until late in}} the nineteenth century. The scattering of manufacturing firms across the country, regardless of the local conditions of employment and wages, made competition intense between the two sectors in summer when wages were generally higher in agriculture than they were in industry. According to their economic situation, plants reacted in dif erent fashions to the threat of seasonal quits, still, in the 1860 's, those who let the workers leave in summer employed around one-third of the industrial labour force.

40|$|Times of high {{unemployment}} always inspire debates {{on the role}} of labor market policy and its optimal implementation. This paper uses a dynamic model of search unemployment and bilateral wage bargaining to characterize optimal labor market policy in a possibly turbulent environment. A firing externality, generated by the existence of a <b>partial</b> <b>unemployment</b> insurance system, distorts the pre-policy equilibrium along three margins: job creation, job acceptance, and job destruction. Optimal policy is characterized by a payroll tax, a firing tax, and a hiring subsidy. Endogenous job acceptance demands that a firing tax and a hiring subsidy have to be set equal in any case and cannot be used to correct for the possible failure of the Hosios condition. In that case the optimal policy mix has to be extended by either an output or recruitment tax/subsidy. It is further shown that the derived policy mix is robust to the introduction of economic turbulence in form of state-dependent worker transitions between skill classes. This is crucial as widely discussed intergroup redistribution schemes, like in-work benefits targeted at low-skilled workers, are rendered considerably less effective in that case. Instead of redistribution from high- to low-skilled workers or from firing firms to unemployed workers, the paper identifies a scheme involving redistribution from firing to hiring firms to be optimal.
