They show that property ownership is an important contributor to women's economic well-being because it reduces their susceptibility to violence.|$|E

That is, the <b>property</b> <b>status</b> of animals prohibits reform that will harm their owners' interests. For that reason, abolitionists argue, it is the <b>property</b> <b>status</b> of animals that must be removed.|$|E
