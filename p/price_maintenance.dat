5|$|The Conservative Party, {{in office}} since 1951, had lost {{standing}} {{as a result}} of the Profumo affair, a sexual scandal involving a defence minister in 1963, and at the time of Lord Home's appointment as Prime Minister seemed headed for heavy electoral defeat. Home's premiership was the second briefest of the twentieth century, lasting two days short of a year. Among the legislation passed under his government was the abolition of resale <b>price</b> <b>maintenance,</b> bringing costs down for the consumer against the interests of producers of food and other commodities.|$|E
5|$|The Resale Prices Bill was {{introduced}} to deny manufacturers and suppliers the power to stipulate the prices at which their goods must be sold by the retailer. At the time, up to forty per cent of goods sold in Britain were subject to such price fixing, {{to the detriment of}} competition and to the disadvantage of the consumer. Douglas-Home, less instinctively liberal on economic matters than Heath, would probably not have sponsored such a proposal unprompted. However, he gave Heath his backing, in the face of opposition from some cabinet colleagues, including Butler, Hailsham and Lloyd, and a substantial number of Conservative backbenchers. They believed the change would benefit supermarkets and other large retailers at the expense of proprietors of small shops. The government was forced to make concessions to avoid defeat. Retail <b>price</b> <b>maintenance</b> would continue to be legal for some goods; these included books, on which it remained in force until market forces led to its abandonment in 1995. Manufacturers and suppliers would also be permitted to refuse to supply any retailer who sold their goods at less than cost price, as a loss leader. The bill had a difficult Parliamentary passage during which the Labour party generally abstained, leaving the Conservatives to vote for or against their own government. The bill received the royal assent in July 1964, but did not become operative until 1965, by which time Douglas-Home, Heath and their colleagues were out of office.|$|E

25|$|After this setback, a major humiliation for Macmillan's foreign policy, Heath {{was not a}} {{contender}} for the party leadership on Macmillan's retirement in October 1963.

500|$|In Britain {{there was}} {{economic}} prosperity; exports [...] "zoomed", according to The Times, {{and the economy}} was growing {{at an annual rate}} of four per cent. Douglas-Home made no pretence to economic expertise; he commented that his problems were of two sorts: [...] "The political ones are insoluble and the economic ones are incomprehensible." [...] On another occasion he said, [...] "When I have to read economic documents I have to have a box of matches and start moving them into position to simplify and illustrate the points to myself." [...] He left Maudling in charge at the Treasury, and promoted Heath to a new business and economic portfolio. The latter took the lead in the one substantial piece of domestic legislation of Douglas-Home's premiership, the abolition of resale <b>price</b> <b>maintenance.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Asda took {{advantage}} of the abolition of retail <b>price</b> <b>maintenance</b> [...] to offer large-scale, low-cost supermarkets. This was aided by the risky decision to acquire three struggling US-owned branches in the mid-1960s of the GEM retail group. The Government Exchange Mart stores in Preston, Lancashire, Cross Gates, Leeds and including the first out-of-town store in West Bridgford in Nottingham, that opened in November 1964, had accumulated losses of £320,000 and offered to sell the stores for 20% of whatever Asda could recoup as losses from the Inland Revenue. They received the whole amount back so got the stores for free. The rent was only 10 shillings (50p) per square foot on a 20-year lease, with no rent reviews- all in all a great deal. Asda increased GEM's £6,000 per week sales to around £60,000 per week in just six months with the new stores named solely as just Asda.|$|E

He won and is the only prime minister to resign the Lords to enter the Commons. [...] His demeanor and appearance remained aristocratic and old-fashioned, however. His understanding of economics was primitive, and he gave his chancellor Reginald Maudling free rein to handle financial affairs. Home's few domestic policies were not well received, but he did abolish retail <b>price</b> <b>maintenance,</b> which allowed consumers to find more bargains on sale.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an intergraded realistic tool, which simulates the future operation (technical and economic) of a tri-generation plant, capable {{of helping the}} potential investor decide if it is profitable {{to proceed with the}} investment. The paper is based on an overall technical-economic analysis of the tri-generation system, including the following steps: Firstly, the data research concerning the energy demands of an actual case. The second part deals with the prime mover (namely the GT) modelling and simulation, including the Design Point (DP) and Off-Design (OD) performance analysis of the GT. The third part includes the simulation of the absorption cooling system alone and/or in co-operation with the prime mover. Finally, an evaluation methodology of tri-generation plants is introduced taking into account both technical facts and realistic economic data helping the potential users to decide whether it is profitable to use such technology or not. The economic scene will include the basic economic facts such as initial cost, handling and operational cost (fuel <b>prices,</b> <b>maintenance</b> etc), using methodology based on NPV. The results are valuated using suitable sensitivity analysis. The results of the analysis generally shown, that the tri-generation plant is more profitable than the conventional way of energy production. Copyright © 2009 by ASME...|$|R
