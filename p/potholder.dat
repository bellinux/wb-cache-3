This is a parody of an America's Newsroom report by Megyn Kelly. It then skips to a house, in which a sex party is coming to an end. Spears starts singing while {{sitting on the edge of}} a bed while the people that surround her are getting dressed. She gets up and looks out the window. As the first verse ends, she picks up a pair of panties from the floor, recalling her personal struggles and the [...] "Piece of Me" [...] video. She dances with four male dancers in the first chorus. During the second chorus, she dances with four other female dancers dressed in cheerleading outfits, while many men are watching them dance. The screen fades to white and Spears begins to change into a conservative '50s-inspired housewife outfit. As the chorus begins again, she comes out of her bedroom. She walks down the stairs, with dancers surrounding her and a woman gives her a <b>potholder,</b> which she uses to pick up a pie. After this, she walks out the front door of the house and is joined by her seemingly conservative-looking husband and children, one of them dressed with the schoolgirl outfit Spears wore in the [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] video. As they go down the walkway, they are surrounded by paparazzi, who have no idea what goes on behind closed doors. While the kids and husband wave, Spears smiles for the camera and blows a kiss. The video then ends with the news anchor saying, [...] "Doesn't make any sense, does it?".|$|E

50|$|The textile <b>potholder</b> was nonexistent in art {{or writing}} until around the 19th century. Evidence in art points towards hooks {{that were used}} to carry hot-handled pots in ancient Greece, but it wasn't until the Antislavery Bazaars of the mid-19th century that equivocally the first home-made potholders were made. These crafts were {{illustrated}} with various designs and advertised the phrase ‘Any holder but a Slave Holder.” By creating such a political craft, which shares similar dimensions and fabrication with the contemporary <b>potholder,</b> women who may have never associated with the abolitionist movement had the opportunity to do so. The popularity of potholders is concomitant with the rise in proliferation of magazines. In these magazines, patterns were given for ‘teapot holders’ which strongly resemble potholders. Insulation capability was limited in early models. Since their genesis as standard household items, potholders have been largely associated with home crafting, and crocheting has long been the leading method in this strain followed by knitting and patchwork. Needlework patterns in the 1950s were often impractical and over-designed with holes and elaborate spacing that would burn the user or wear out the holder quickly. In the 1970s, quilting and applique-made <b>potholder</b> patterns gained popularity, enduring into the present day.|$|E
5000|$|During {{preparations}} {{for a dinner}} party at the mansion, Curly, {{more interested in the}} Colonel's daughter, Miss Judith Butts (Phyllis Crane), manages to mistake a quilted <b>potholder</b> for a cake, resulting in a feather-coughing scene. The short concludes with an episode in which Larry and Curly disguise themselves as, respectively, Captain Dodge's father and wife. This leads to a controversial gag in which Major [...] "Bloodhound" [...] Filbert (Ted Lorch) inquires about Captain Dodge's baby. Moe runs off and brings in a swaddled infant, which is revealed to be black, thus giving away the Stooges' charade.|$|E
5000|$|In 1942, McCardell created her famed [...] "Popover Dress." [...] It was a {{response}} to a Harper's Bazaar challenge to create something fashionable you could wear to clean the house and then wear to a cocktail party. The simple grey dress came with a matching <b>potholder</b> which fit into the dress's pocket. [...] The [...] "Popover Dress" [...] sold for $6.95 and over 75,000 were sold in the first season alone. [...] These dresses became a staple of McCardells collections and over time she made version in different lengths and fabrics. [...] The [...] "Popover Dress" [...] received a citation from the American Fashion Critics Association and in 1943, McCardell won a Coty Award.|$|E
50|$|Patterns {{to create}} pot-holders at home were first {{seen in the}} United States in {{pamphlets}} and magazines, including periodicals like Workbasket, whose primary target audience consisted of the middle and working classes. This appearance of needlework patterns in magazines began around 1880 and continued to be prominent through the 1930s. During the Depression Era, designs for <b>potholders</b> were being published by the household press as well as makers of yarns and threads. This period of time is when pot-holders blossomed into the useful, diverse art form that is recognized by needleworkers today.|$|R

50|$|To prevent {{children}} from getting burned, water temperature {{must not be}} set too high when taking baths or washing hands, nonflammable sleepwear should be worn, backburners should be used when cooking something on the stove, and hot foods, drinks, and irons should be kept away {{from the edge of}} counter and table. Oven mitts and <b>potholders</b> must be used in handling hot containers. People should be careful when taking hot foods out of microwave ovens, and covers should be opened gently {{to reduce the risk of}} steam burns.|$|R

25|$|The strong Victorian colours disappeared, though, and new {{publications}} {{called for}} white or pale threads, except for fancy purses, which were often crocheted of brightly colored silk and elaborately beaded. After World War I, far fewer crochet patterns were published, {{and most of}} them were simplified versions of the early 20th-century patterns. After World War II, from the late 1940s until the early 1960s, there was a resurgence in interest in home crafts, particularly in the United States, with many new and imaginative crochet designs published for colorful doilies, <b>potholders,</b> and other home items, along with updates of earlier publications. These patterns called for thicker threads and yarns than in earlier patterns and included wonderful variegated colors. The craft remained primarily a homemaker's art until the late 1960s and early 1970s, when the new generation picked up on crochet and popularized granny squares, a motif worked in the round and incorporating bright colors.|$|R

40|$|At {{first glance}} my paintings, videos and {{performances}} {{appear to be}} a surreal ad campaign for a mysterious product. I saturate every surface with color, transmute slogans into short poems and spin the plots of 30 -second commercials into unique incantations. If ads could sleep, their dreams might manifest themselves as similarly bewildering visions. Images of women advertising face creams that promise to be 5 % less sad, cell phones with the added feature of providing true intimacy or a bra that simultaneously acts as birth control and a nicotine patch speak to the insatiable desires manufactured by consumer culture. An auctioneer maniacally barking the aesthetic virtues of a canvas as she haphazardly slaps paint onto it and tries to sell it points to the absurdity of our current value system. An affectionate correspondence between an artist and a global coffee franchise humorously conjures the fallibility of public and private personas. Slick as a fresh manicure yet plush as a hand-knit <b>potholder,</b> my work strikes a balance between humanity and its corporate alter ego. My aim is not merely to parody and critique commercial media but to grasp the mechanics of desire and manipulation. While I borrow some of its techniques, the construct of advertising eventually recedes altogether leaving only an abstract narrative. This, too, dissolves until all that remains are two voices. One voice is a version of my own; the other is my fantasy projection of the collective voice of the outside world. The conversation is about art and authenticity...|$|E
40|$|St. Martin de Porres {{was born}} out of wedlock in Lima, Peru, on December 9, 1579 to Don Juan de Porres, a Spanish nobleman and adventurer, and Ana Velasquez, a freed {{daughter}} of slaves from Panama. His father abandoned the family when Martin and his sister, Juana, were very young. Ana Velasquez supported her children by taking in laundry. Martin’s childhood poverty did not embitter him but made him sensitive to the plight of the poor, and especially the orphans to whom he would devote much of his time and resources. Even as a child, Martin would give the family’s scarce resources to the beggars whom he saw as less fortunate than himself. When Martin turned eight, his father {{had a change of heart}} and decided to claim his two mulatto children in spite of the gossip to which it subjected him. He made sure that both were afforded a good education and had enough money for the family not to suffer privation. At the age of twelve, Martin began an apprenticeship with a barber/surgeon named Marcel de Rivero. He proved extremely skillful at this trade and soon customers, who at first were skeptical of the young black lad, came to prefer and ask for him. After leaving home, Martin took a room in the house of Ventura de Luna. Always a devoted Catholic who spent much time in church, Martin begged his landlady for some candle stubs. She was curious about his activities and one night spied on him through a keyhole and witnessed Martin in a vigil of ecstatic prayer — a practice he would continue throughout his life. Martin de Porres joined the Dominican Order of Preachers as a donado (lay helper or tertiary). The donados were the lowest-ranking Dominicans, performing the heaviest chores in the Order. He was eventually elevated to brother but never did become a full priest. Martin continued to practice his old trades of barbering and healing and performed many, many miraculous cures. He also took on kitchen work, laundry, and cleaning. His relationship with his brothers was tinged by their curiosity and occasional pranks. For example, just before the meal was to be served, they would hide the <b>potholders</b> and Martin would have to lift the scalding pots with his bare hands. Yet never once did his fingers get burned! Martin often challenged his brothers on their racial attitudes. In one story, Martin came upon a group of Indians sweeping the floor under the watchful eye of one of the Dominican brothers. When told that they were cleaning to repay a meal they had received, Martin pointed out that the brother had fed some white people the previous day without forcing them to clean. After Martin’s firm but gentle challenge, the brother took up the broom himself. [URL]...|$|R
