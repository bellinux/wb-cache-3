50|$|Opacity-based varieties: Altocumulus {{stratiformis}} {{has three}} opacity-based varieties; Translucidus (CM3), <b>perlucidus</b> (CM3 or 7 depending on predominant opacity), and opacus (CM7). Varieties based on opacity are not commonly associatied with the species lenticularis, castellanus, or floccus.|$|E
5000|$|Opacity-basedAll cloud {{varieties}} {{fall into}} one of two main groups. One group identifies the opacities of particular low and mid-level cloud structures and comprises the varieties translucidus (thin translucent), <b>perlucidus</b> (thick opaque with translucent or very small clear breaks), and opacus (thick opaque). These varieties are always identifiable for cloud genera and species with variable opacity. All three are associated with the stratiformis species of altocumulus and stratocumulus. However, only two varieties are seen with altostratus and stratus nebulosus whose uniform structures prevent the formation of a <b>perlucidus</b> variety.

[...] Similarly, these varieties are also not associated with moderate and towering vertical clouds because they are always opaque.|$|E
5000|$|Altocumulus (From Latin Altus, [...] "high", cumulus, [...] "heaped") is a middle-altitude {{cloud genus}} that belongs {{mainly to the}} stratocumuliform {{physical}} category characterized by globular masses or rolls in layers or patches, the individual elements being larger and darker than those of cirrocumulus and smaller than those of stratocumulus. [...] However, if the layers become tufted in appearance due to increased airmass instability, then the altocumulus clouds become more purely cumuliform in structure. Like other cumuliform and stratocumuliform clouds, altocumulus signifies convection. A sheet of partially conjoined altocumulus <b>perlucidus</b> is sometimes found preceding a weakening warm front, where the altostratus is starting to fragment, resulting in patches of altocumulus <b>perlucidus</b> between the areas of altostratus. Altocumulus is also commonly found between the warm and cold fronts in a depression, although this is often hidden by lower clouds.|$|E
50|$|Another variety, {{duplicatus}} (closely spaced {{layers of}} the same type, one above the other), is sometimes found with cirrus of both the fibratus and uncinus species, and with altocumulus and stratocumulus of the species stratiformis and lenticularis. The variety undulatus (having a wavy undulating base) can occur with any clouds of the species stratiformis or lenticularis, and with altostratus. It is only rarely observed with stratus nebulosus. The variety lacunosus is caused by localized downdrafts that create circular holes {{in the form of}} a honeycomb or net. It is occasionally seen with cirrocumulus and altocumulus of the species stratiformis, castellanus, and floccus, and with stratocumulus of the species stratiformis and castellanus.CombinationsIt is possible for some species to show combined varieties at one time, especially if one variety is opacity-based and the other is pattern-based.

40|$|Abstract A new palaemonid shrimp genus, Michaelimenes n. gen., is {{established}} for three Indo-West Pacific species, Periclimenes latipollex Kemp, 1922, Periclimenes <b>perlucidus</b> Bruce, 1969 (type species) and Periclimenes platydactylus Li, 2008. The present new genus can be immediately distinguished from other related genera by {{the combination of}} the second pereiopod with the dorsal flange on the dactylus, the proximal excavation on the fixed finger and the smooth propodus, and the unarmed, non-subspatulate fingers of the first pereiopod. The type species, Michaelimenes <b>perlucidus,</b> is recorded from Japan {{for the first time on}} the basis of 34 specimens associated with the alcyonacean genus Chironephthya Studer, 1887. The intraspecific morphological variation and host specificity of M. <b>perlucidus</b> are commented upon. Periclimenes involens Bruce, 1996 is regarded as a junior synonym of M. <b>perlucidus...</b>|$|E
