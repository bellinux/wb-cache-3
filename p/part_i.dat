5|$|According to Paine {{scholars}} Edward Davidson and William Scheick, {{he probably}} {{wrote the first}} draft of <b>Part</b> <b>I</b> in late 1793, but Paine biographer David Hawke argues for a date of early 1793. It is also unclear whether or not a French edition of <b>Part</b> <b>I</b> was published in 1793. François Lanthenas, who translated The Age of Reason into French in 1794, wrote that it was first published in France in 1793, but no book fitting his description has been positively identified. Barlow published the first English edition of The Age of Reason, <b>Part</b> <b>I</b> in 1794 in London, selling it for a mere three pence.|$|E
