50|$|Over time, {{questions}} have been raised concerning the long-term impact of the massive application of these highly efficacious, broad-spectrum anthelmintic compounds on the environment. Due to the bioavilability of some of these drugs, high percentages of these substances are being excreted unchanged after oral or systemic administration (Farkas et al., 2003; Plumb, 2008). Decomposing animal excrements/waste is spread all over our land for increased crop productivity, hereby also spreading the anthelmintic drugs and their residues. To this day however, we remain oblivious to what the possible long-term ecological effects of these drugs and their residues are on pasture fauna and flora (Spratt, 1997). This concern, among others, is stimulating the need for alternative, more biological measures of parasite control. In biological farming, the use of traditional synthetic drugs is not allowed and therefore, organic farmers prefer a <b>phytopharmaceutical</b> approach for the control of parasitic infections on their farm (van Krimpen et al., 2010). Although many plants are suggested to have some nematocidal effects (Chitwood, 2002), recent studies by van Krimpen et al., (2010) could not show any significant reduction on the worm load of infected pigs after treatment with a herb mixture (Thymus vulgaris, Melissa officinalis and Echinacea purpurea), Papaya fruits, Bolbo leaf or complete Artemesia plants in comparison with untreated controls. Nevertheless, continued efforts could be made to standardize the plant extracts with good anthelmintic activity and formulate best alternative herbal preparations to replace or complement the synthetic drugs, which are currently in use. In addition to <b>phytopharmaceutical</b> research, the possibility of using nematophageous fungi for the biological control of A. suum is currently being investigated. According to the study of Ferreira et al., (2011) mycelia of Pochonia chlamydosporia, which were added to the food of pigs, showed ovicidal activity against A. suum eggs after passage through the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E

5000|$|In <b>phytopharmaceutical</b> or herbal medicine, {{the active}} {{ingredient}} may be either unknown or may require cofactors {{in order to achieve}} therapeutic goals. This leads to complications in labelling. One way manufacturers have attempted to indicate strength is to engage in standardization to a marker compound. However, standardization has not been achieved yet: different companies use different markers, or different levels of the same markers, or different methods of testing for marker compounds. For instance, St John's wort is often standardized to the hypericin which is now known not to be the [...] "active ingredient" [...] for antidepressant use. Other companies standardize to hyperforin or both, although there may be some 24 known possible active constituents.

40|$|Abstract: Cecropia glaziovi Snethl., Urticaceae, is {{commonly}} used in South America {{and is one of}} the species included in the Brazilian Medicinal Plants Research Program. Pharmacological studies have led to reports of the potential of C. glaziovi as a hypotensive, antiasthmatic and anxiolytic agent. The strict requirements regarding the quality, safety and effectiveness of <b>phytopharmaceutical</b> products represent an enormous challenge in the search for products with a high level of uniformity, reproducibility and stability. The incorporation of dry extracts into multiparticulate dosage forms, such as pellets produced by extrusion/spheronization technology, is a suitable alternative to overcome the lack of technological properties of dry extracts, since they are associated with low fl owability and high hygroscopicity. In this study, an optimized dry extract (ODE) of C. glaziovi was incorporated into pellets seeking to decrease the moisture sorption and increase the stability, safety and percentage of the extract in the fi nal product. Pellets containing around 50 % of ODE were considered the most technologically viable, offering a narrow particle size distribution, signifi cant improvement in the fl owability and compressibility properties, and decrease in the moisture compared with the ODE. In conclusion, pellets containing a high dose of the C. glaviovi extract were successfully prepared, achieving degrees of quality, physical stability and feasibility compatible with the desirable characteristics of a <b>phytopharmaceutical.</b> Keywords: Cecropia glaziovi extrusion-spheronization moisture sorption pellets <b>phytopharmaceutical...</b>|$|E

However, most reported HPLC methods are not simple and their work-up procedure are inadequate. The present paper describes a simple and non-expensive method for extraction and determination of ginkgolides A and B in GB leaves and their <b>phytopharmaceuticals.</b> The method is based upon extraction of ginkgolides from aqueous solution by activated charcoal, followed by extraction with Methanol and injection of the Methanolic solution into chromatographic system.

50|$|One {{characteristic}} of crude drug material is that constituents {{may have an}} opposite, moderating or enhancing effect. Hence, the final effect of any crude drug material will be {{a product of the}} interactions between the constituents and the effect of each constituent on its own. To effectively study the existence and effect of such interactions, scientific studies must examine the effect that multiple constituents, given concurrently, have on the system. Herbalists assert that as <b>phytopharmaceuticals</b> rely upon synergy for their activities, plants with high levels of active constituents like ginsenosides or hypericin may not correlate with the strength of the herbs. In <b>phytopharmaceuticals</b> or herbal medicine, the therapeutic effects of herbs cannot be determined unless its active ingredient or cofactors are identified or the herb is administered as a whole. One way to indicate strength is standardization to one or several marker compound that are believed to be mainly responsible for the biological effects. However, many herbalists believe that the active ingredient in a plant is the plant itself.|$|R

To assess practice patterns determinants of (non-) <b>phytopharmaceutical</b> prescriptions, referrals and hospitalizations were analyzed using mixed-effects Poisson regression models. As explanatory variables, the qualification of the GP in NM, the age group and sex of the patient, as well as bivariate interactions between these variables were considered. GPs additionally qualified in naturopathy exhibited higher rates of <b>phytopharmaceutical</b> prescriptions (p< 0. 034; independent effect) compared to conventional GPs. This association was not observed with respect to non-phytopharmaceutical prescriptions. However, interaction effects between qualification and age group as well as sex were present with respect to both <b>phytopharmaceutical</b> and non-phytopharmaceutical prescriptions (all p< 0. 001). No further independent association existed between qualification and either referral rates or hospitalization rates, but again interactions between qualification and age group and sex (only referrals) were statistically significant (all p< 0. 0001).
