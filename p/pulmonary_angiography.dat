5|$|Lung lesions, once identified, {{are usually}} treated to prevent episodes of {{bleeding}} {{and more importantly}} embolism to the brain. This is particularly done in lesions with a feeding blood vessel of 3mm or larger, as {{these are the most}} likely to cause long-term complications unless treated. The most effective current therapy is embolization with detachable metal coils. The procedure involves puncture of a large vein (usually under a general anesthetic), followed by advancing of a catheter through the right ventricle and into the pulmonary artery, after which radiocontrast is injected to visualize the AVMs (<b>pulmonary</b> <b>angiography).</b> Once the lesion has been identified, coils are deployed that obstruct the blood flow and allow the lesion to regress. In experienced hands, the procedure tends to be very effective and with limited side effects, but lesions may recur and further attempts may be required. CTA scans are repeated to monitor for recurrence. Surgical excision has now essentially been abandoned due to the success of embolotherapy.|$|E

25|$|CT <b>{{pulmonary}}</b> <b>angiography</b> (CTPA) is a pulmonary angiogram obtained using {{computed tomography}} (CT) with radiocontrast rather than right heart catheterization. Its advantages are clinical equivalence, its non-invasive nature, its greater availability to people, {{and the possibility}} of identifying other lung disorders from the differential diagnosis in case there is no pulmonary embolism.|$|E
25|$|PE usually {{results from}} a blood clot in the leg that travels to the lung. The risk of blood clots is {{increased}} by cancer, prolonged bed rest, smoking, stroke, certain genetic conditions, estrogen-based medication, pregnancy, obesity, and after some types of surgery. A small proportion of cases are due to the embolization of air, fat, or amniotic fluid. Diagnosis is based on signs and symptoms in combination with test results. If the risk is low a blood test known as a D-dimer will rule out the condition. Otherwise a CT <b>pulmonary</b> <b>angiography,</b> lung ventilation/perfusion scan, or ultrasound of the legs may confirm the diagnosis. Together deep vein thrombosis and PE are known as venous thromboembolism (VTE).|$|E
25|$|Assessing the {{accuracy}} of CT <b>pulmonary</b> <b>angiography</b> is hindered by the rapid changes {{in the number of}} rows of detectors available in multidetector CT (MDCT) machines. According to a cohort study, single-slice spiral CT may help diagnose detection among people with suspected pulmonary embolism. In this study, the sensitivity was 69% and specificity was 84%. In this study which had a prevalence of detection was 32%, the positive predictive value of 67.0% and negative predictive value of 85.2%. However, this study's results may be biased due to possible incorporation bias, since the CT scan was the final diagnostic tool in people with pulmonary embolism. The authors noted that a negative single slice CT scan is insufficient to rule out pulmonary embolism on its own. A separate study with a mixture of 4 slice and 16 slice scanners reported a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 96%, which means that it is a good test for ruling out a pulmonary embolism if it is not seen on imaging and that it is very good at confirming a pulmonary embolism is present if it is seen. This study noted that additional testing is necessary when the clinical probability is inconsistent with the imaging results. CTPA is non-inferior to VQ scanning, and identifies more emboli (without necessarily improving the outcome) compared to VQ scanning.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Pulmonary {{arterial}} hypertension (PAH) is a progressive vascular disease {{that results in}} high mortality and morbidity in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients.

40|$|PURPOSE: To compare {{radiation}} dose delivered at four- and 16 -detector row computed tomography (CT) with a dose-modulation program and that delivered at digital angiography {{for evaluation of}} pulmonary embolism (PE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The {{part of the study}} involving patients (seven women, four men; mean age, 62 years +/- 16 [standard deviation]; range, 41 - 85 years) was approved by the institutional review board. Patients gave written informed consent. Exposure was performed with an anthropomorphic phantom with thermoluminescent dosimeters for four-detector row CT without the dose-modulation program and 16 -detector row CT without and with the dose-modulation program with standard protocols for <b>pulmonary</b> CT <b>angiography</b> (120 kV, 144 mAs, four and 16 detector rows with 1. 00 - and 0. 75 -mm section thickness, respectively). Digital angiograms were acquired with four standard projections at 80 kV. For digital angiography, {{radiation dose}} was calculated according to phantom measurements and adapted to acquisition and fluoroscopy times. Distribution of dose was compared for CT and digital <b>angiography.</b> RESULTS: During <b>pulmonary</b> CT <b>angiography,</b> mean radiation dose delivered at middle of chest was 21. 5, 19. 5, and 18. 2 mGy for four-detector row CT and for 16 -detector row CT without and with dose-modulation program, respectively. At the same level, a mean dose of 91 mGy was delivered with digital angiography. The dose adjusted to clinical conditions was 139. 0 mGy for digital angiography and could be reduced after technical adjustment. Ratios of maximum dose to mean dose were 1. 15 and 2. 96 for CT and digital angiography, respectively. With application of the dose-modulation program at 16 -detector row CT, radiation dose was reduced 15 %- 20 % at the upper chest. CONCLUSION: Multi-detector row CT delivers a lower radiation dose, with better spatial distribution of dose, than does <b>pulmonary</b> CT <b>angiography.</b> With 16 -detector row CT and a dose-modulation program, radiation dose is decreased during PE work-up...|$|R

40|$|During {{the period}} from 1961 to 1981, 40 {{pulmonary}} embolectomies were performed in 39 patients who were in extremis {{at the time of}} initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass. In a 460 -bed hospital with more than 17, 000 acute admissions and 4, 000 operations per year, this small number represents the few patients who are potentially salvageable by urgent embolectomy.

40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the relationship between the Geneva clinical rules, pulmonary artery computed tomography index ratio (PACTOIR) and patient mortality in patients with suspected pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE). Material and Method: The spiral tomographic <b>pulmonary</b> <b>angiographies</b> of 88 patients were analyzed retrospectively in search of PTE. The Geneva clinical possibility scoring for each patient was also calculated. The exitus patients were investigated. Results: 37 (42 %) of the patients were diagnosed to have PTE, while this diagnosis was sidelined in 51 (58 %) of them. While according to the Geneva clinical scoring system 27. 2 % of the patients had a high clinical possibility, 52. 3 % had a medium clinical possibility and 20. 5 % had low possibility for PTE, patients with PTE displayed the clinical risks to be 48. 7 %, 37. 8 % and 13. 5 % respectively. In the groups of clinical possibility classification, the averages of PACTOIR for differentiation analysis was found to be significant (p< 0. 005). In this study we found that 6 patients had died. In all patients lost due to PTE, there was a higher rate of clinical possibility and high PACTOIR rates. Conclusion: Pulmonary artery computed tomography obstruction index ratio shows the load of the thrombus thus giving the clinician a good perspective about the prognosis of the patient...|$|R

40|$|Indirect {{computed}} tomography (CT) venography reportedly provides high accuracy for detection of venous thrombosis in patients suspected of pulmonary embolism (PE). Nevertheless, {{the extent of}} the scanning range for lower limb and abdominal veins remains to be determined. It was the objective of this study to investigate the distribution of venous thrombosis in order to identify the most appropriate extent of scanning range when using CT venography. We reviewed 1, 408 combined CT <b>pulmonary</b> <b>angiographies</b> (CTPA) and indirect CT venographies of the lower limbs, performed in patients suspected of PE. Percentage of venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes PE and/or venous thrombosis was calculated. Location and the upper end of clots were recorded in 37 venous segments per patient from calf to diaphragm. PE, venous thrombosis and VTE, were found respectively in 272 (19. 3 %), 259 (18. 4 %) and 329 (23. 4 %) patients. Addition of CT venography to CTPA increased depiction of VTE in 17. 3 %. The upper end of venous thrombosis was located below the knee in 48 %, between knee and inguinal ligament in 36 % of the patients, and above the inguinal ligament in 15 %. Ninety-six patients had thrombosis in a single vein, of which none occurred above the iliac crests in a patient without PE at CTPA. In conclusion, when added to CTPA, optimal scanning of CT venography should extent from calves to the iliac crests in patients suspected of VTE. Peer reviewe...|$|R
