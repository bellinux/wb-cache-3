50|$|Due to the {{expensive}} gold content, shakudō is normally limited to accents or small {{items such as}} tsuba. Larger objects (such as vases) described as shakudō may be mislabeled, especially if the glossy blue-black color is not evident. Unpatinated or repolished shakudō will not spontaneously <b>patinate</b> in air.|$|E
50|$|Rokushō (緑青) is a {{traditional}} Japanese compound for inducing patination in decorative non-ferrous metals, especially several alloys which are nearly unknown outside Japan. Shakudō, an alloy of copper and gold, becomes dark blue-violet; shibuichi, an alloy of fine silver and copper in a higher percentage than sterling, turns misty aquamarine; and kuromido dark coppery black. These alloys are becoming increasingly popular in high-end artistic jewelry, especially in bi-metals (a layer of the alloy fused to another metal such as sterling). Rokushō was generally used to <b>patinate</b> all types of mokume-gane as well. Although other patination agents {{can be used on}} these metals, some artisans prefer the rich colors achieved through traditional Rokushō.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{challenging}} aspects of the conservation of Kamehameha the Great (original cast) was determining the original appearance of the statue. Since conservators traditionally strive to uphold the artist’s intent when caring for an artwork, figuring out this piece of information was of critical importance. While the Honolulu cast sported a patinated surface with gilt (See gilding) garments, the North Kohala cast had been painted in lifelike colors for as long as any local residents of the island could remember, and it wasn’t clear whether the statue had been originally gilt or painted. Historical accounts provided little assistance to the investigation, as articles written on the sculpture {{at the time of its}} unveiling in the 1880s offered conflicting and often contradictory descriptions of the artwork. However, by analyzing paint chip samples taken from the statue’s surface using X-ray fluorescence and X-ray diffraction, Wharton was eventually able to gather evidence of 24kt gold leaf residue beneath the layers of paint, effectively concluding that the statue had, like its Honolulu counterpart, an original patinated and gilded surface. [...] Wharton theorized that because of damage caused by the shipwreck, the sculpture’s surface had corroded badly before its eventual transport to Hawaii in 1883, and due to lack of materials and technical expertise to regild and <b>patinate</b> the surface, the statue was instead cleaned and then painted entirely brown in order to prepare it in time for Kalākaua’s coronation ceremony. At some point between 1883 and 1912, the tradition of painting the sculpture in multiple colors began.|$|E

The Lower Old Red Sandstone in southern Britain has provided important evidence in elucidating the early history of vascular plants on land (Edwards 1979). Of particular import-ance is the more or less continuous equence of plant assemblages from a relatively localized area (South Wales and the Welsh Borderland). These have been recovered from rocks spanning the transition from marine Upper Silurian int...|$|E
