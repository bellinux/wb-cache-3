5000|$|... "The most {{valuable}} development since 2000 {{has been the}} open exposure of the misbehavior of priests and religious. This has been one element that alerts not just Catholics but members of other religious groups to the potential sexual dangers posed {{by men and women}} in positions of power over young people. The church has contributed to the education about child abuse and the need for <b>prevention</b> <b>of</b> <b>abuse</b> and to provide education for protection for all children and the vulnerable. Unfortunately the efforts of the Catholic Church have been forced on them by the public outcry, victims’ testimony, and the legal system that calls bishops and religious superiors to account for their gross neglect, conspiracies to conceal crimes, and fraud to keep abuse secret. It is an ongoing fight to keep the church honest. Catholic laymen and women (Governor Frank Keating and Chief Justice Anne Burke) who have worked closely with church officials say that the bishops do not want to change, but only want “business as usual.” The encouraging thing is that people do not accept the word of bishops as true, necessary or important anymore. Over thirty percent of men and women brought up as Catholic no longer identify themselves as Catholic." ...|$|E

5000|$|On 12 November 2010, the Press Office of the Holy See {{announced}} that [...] "The Visitation will identify whether the mutual {{relationship of the}} various components of the local Church, seminaries and religious communities is now in place, in order to sustain them {{on the path of}} profound spiritual renewal already being pursued by the Church in Ireland. It also has the goal of verifying the effectiveness of the present processes used in responding to cases of abuse and of the current forms of assistance provided to the victims. It will not be an investigation into individual cases of abuse nor a trial to judge past events. The Visitators will have to identify the explicit problems which may require some assistance from the Holy See". Importantly the press release noted that [...] "The Visitation will in no way interfere with the ordinary activity of local magistrates, nor with the activity of the Commissions of Investigation established by the Irish Parliament nor with the work of any legislative authority, which has competence in the area of <b>prevention</b> <b>of</b> <b>abuse</b> of minors. The Visitation does not seek to replace the legitimate authority of the local Bishops or Religious Superiors, who maintain responsibility in the handling of cases of abuse". This was seen to be in response to some complaints that canon law was seen to override civil law, which some argued led to greater cover up and further abuse. The release made clear that the visitors would [...] "monitor how well the guidelines of Safeguarding Children, Standards and Guidance Document for the Catholic Church in Ireland, commissioned and produced in February 2009 by the National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church, are functioning and how they may be better implemented and improved." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Anonymous {{communication}} can, by {{its very}} nature, facilitate socially unacceptable behavior; such abuse of anonymity is a serious impediment to its widespread deployment. This paper studies two notions related to the <b>prevention</b> <b>of</b> <b>abuse.</b> The first is selective traceability, the property that a message’s sender can be traced {{with the help of}} an explicitly stated set of parties. The second is noncoercibility, the property that no party can convince an adversary (using technical means) that he was not the sender of a message. We show that, in principal, almost any anonymity scheme can be made selectively traceable, and that a particular anonymity scheme can be modified to be noncoercible. ...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To provide {{recommendations}} for family physicians on the detection, assessment {{and management of}} abuse or mistreatment in patients over 65 years of age. OPTIONS: Detection of elder abuse by history and examination or by specific protocols; intervention through mandatory reporting, removing the victim from the situation or acting as an advocate for the patient. OUTCOMES: Termination of abusive situation and prevention of further abuse. EVIDENCE: A MEDLINE search was conducted {{with the use of}} medical subject headings "elder abuse" and "epidemiology" for articles published from January 1980 to October 1992 and headings "elder abuse" and "clinical trials" for articles published from January 1980 to February 1994. Standard references and review articles and their bibliographies were scrutinized, and experts were consulted. VALUES: The evidence-based methods and values of the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination were used. Since senior citizens are among the most disadvantaged people in Canadian society, <b>prevention</b> <b>of</b> <b>abuse</b> and promotion of their autonomy were the highest values selected. BENEFITS, HARMS AND COSTS: The principal benefits are cessation and <b>prevention</b> <b>of</b> <b>abuse.</b> Potential harms include the loss of a personal residence, the erosion of an established family structure and the loss of autonomy for the victim. RECOMMENDATIONS: There is poor evidence to include case finding for elder abuse in or exclude it from the periodic health examination. However, it is prudent for physicians to be alert for indications of elder abuse and, if such abuse is discovered, to take measures to prevent further abuse...|$|E
40|$|Elder abuse first {{received}} {{national attention}} in 1980, {{as the subject}} of a congressional investigation. Now, 20 years later, establishing successful strategies of identification, subsequent intervention, and <b>prevention</b> <b>of</b> <b>abuse</b> is of paramount importance; but progress toward this goal is hindered by lack of consensus as to the definition of elder abuse, and the use of vague, confusing, and sometimes contradictory terms in its discussion. In this paper, both social research and professional approaches and legal approaches to the definition of elder abuse are surveyed, as are definitions formulated for the National Elder Abuse Incidence Study conducted by the National Center on Elder Abuse. The continuing need for a universal or standard definition is emphasized...|$|E
