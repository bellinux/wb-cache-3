40|$|In {{line with}} the current {{interest}} in animal welfare in animal husbandry, this study of two groups of 24 sheep compares milking performances at a low vacuum level (28 kPa) and at a standard level (42 kPa) that is normally used for sheep. The two working vacuum levels were tested with three different combinations of pulsator rate and <b>pulsator</b> <b>ratio.</b> Each of the experiments lasted 21 days, of which 11 were for adaptation and 10 were for collecting data. The milking machine used was a low line with 24 stalls, 12 milking units controlled by two operators, a milk line 74 mm in diameter, and a cluster with a total mass of 490 g. The measurements performed were {{the dynamics of the}} vacuum level in the short milk tube and the milk line during milking, and the time duration for each individual milking. There {{were no significant differences in}} fluctuations in vacuum in either the short tube or the milk line at the two vacuum levels used. By contrast, there was a significant increase in vacuum fluctuations in the short milk tube when the <b>pulsator</b> <b>ratio</b> changed from 50 % to 60 %. The milk flow time for each sheep increased on average by 17 % with low vacuum, while the throughput of the system was reduced by some 4 %, from 333 to 321 sheep/h...|$|E
40|$|Basically, the ISO {{standard}} 5707 (Milking machines installations: {{construction and}} performance) applies to milking machines for small ruminants for {{qualitative and quantitative}} requirements that are similar for dairy cattle such as vacuum regulation, sizing airlines, vacuum gages and receiver. Specific quantitative requirements for sheep were introduced {{by a group of}} experts within the International Dairy Federation (I. D. F.) and published in a bulletin in March 2002. New recommendations, especially for vacuum pump capacity and effective reserve, are now available. For ewes, they take into account the type of cluster used, the number of operators with the type of machine (bucket or milkline) and the number of units. Vacuum pump capacity is also calculated referring to air used during the cleaning process (only for machine with milkline). Furthermore, regulation must be well adjusted in order to maintain a stable vacuum within the plant at every moment of milking. Pulsation characteristics are important for ewes because they have a direct influence on stimulation of milk let-down. The best pulsation rate should be 150 - 180 cycles/min and a <b>pulsator</b> <b>ratio</b> of 50 %. Sizing milklines is similar to cows but taking into account the particular milk kinetics of the East-Friesian ewes and the type of cluster used. Finally, recent recordings of vacuum beyond the teat and in the claw (or SMT) and of liner movements presented in this document can be useful for helping farmers in their choice of new equipment...|$|E
40|$|Different {{settings}} {{of the operating}} parameters (pulsator rate, <b>pulsator</b> <b>ratio</b> and vacuum) are used for milking dairy species {{in different parts of}} the world. The level of the operating vacuum in machine milking is one of the principal factors which influence the integrity of the tissues and the milk quality. High vacuum levels (> 42 kPa) are often used to facilitate the opening of the teat canal by overcoming the biological closing forces whithin the teat sphincter, but can result in severe machine-induced teat tissue damage. In this study characteristics and performances of mechanical milking at low vacuum levels have been investigated in different dairy species. Milking times and milk productions have been obtained from milk emission curves, recorded by electronic milk-meters (LactoCorder®) during the milking at different vacuum levels of sheep, goats and buffaloes. The results of the comparative experiments clearly indicate that a low vacuum level modifies the kinetics of milk emission, the machine-on time and, thus, the throughput of milking system, in all the dairy species considered. Milk yield was satisfactory at any level tested, showing that low vacuums can be adequate to completely empty the udder. Slight differences were found across species concerning the increase in the milking time per head associated with low levels of milking vacuum Our study represents a contribution to encourage the decrease of the working vacuum during mechanical milking, also for those dairy species generally considered hard to be milked, as buffaloes. Milking should be performed applying the lowest vacuum level, compatible with not excessively prolonging milking time, in line with the animal welfare on dairy husbandry...|$|E

40|$|Friesian-type {{dairy cows}} were milked with {{different}} machine settings {{to determine the}} effect of these settings on teat tissue reaction and on milking characteristics. Three teat-cup liner designs were used with varying upper barrel dimensions (wide-bore WB = 31. 6 mm; narrow-bore NB = 21. 0 mm; narrow-bore NB 1 = 25. 0 mm). These liners were tested with alternate and simultaneous pulsation patterns, pulsator ratios (60 : 40 and 67 : 33) and three system vacuum levels (40, 44 and 50 kPa). Teat tissue was measured using ultrasonography, before milking and directly after milking. The measurements recorded were teat canal length (TCL), teat diameter (TD), cistern diameter (CD) and teat wall thickness (TWT). Teat tissue changes were similar with a system vacuum level of either 50 kPa (mid-level) or 40 kPa (low-level). Widening the liner upper barrel bore dimension from 21. 0 mm (P < 0. 01) or 25. 0 mm (P < 0. 001) to 31. 6 mm increased the magnitude of changes in TD and TWT after machine milking. Milk yield per cow was significantly (P < 0. 05) higher and cluster-on time was reduced (P < 0. 01) with the WB cluster as compared to the NB 1 cluster. Minimum changes in teat tissue parameters were achieved with system vacuum level of 40 kPa and 50 kPa using NB and WB clusters, respectively. Similar changes in teat tissue and milk yield per cow were observed with alternate and simultaneous pulsation patterns. Widening <b>pulsator</b> <b>ratio</b> from 60 : 40 to 67 : 33 did not have negative effects on changes in teat tissue and had a positive effect on milk yield and milking time. Milk liner design had a bigger effect on teat tissue changes and milking characteristics than pulsation settings. </p...|$|E
40|$|The vacuum {{variations}} at {{the apex}} of an artificial teat during simulated milking were measured in a factorial-design laboratory test involving six cluster types, two internal diameters (13. 5 mm and 16 mm) of long milk tube (LMT), three water flow rates (4, 6 and 8 l/min), simultaneous (4 × 0) and alternate (2 × 2) pulsation patterns and three pulsator ratios (60, 64, and 68 %). Four of the six clusters were fitted with wide-bore tapered liners and represented all combinations of two claw volumes (150 or 420 ml) and two short-milk-tube bores (8. 5 mm and 13. 5 mm). Two clusters were fitted with narrow-bore liners (22 and 25 mm) that had large-bore short milk tubes and large claw volumes. The vacuum variations were expressed as mean vacuum at the teat-end during the b-phase of pulsation (TVB), mean vacuum at the teat end measured over complete pulsation cycles (TV), minimum vacuum measured over complete pulsation cycles (TVM) and amplitude of vacuum fluctuation measured over complete pulsation cycles (TVF). The highest level of TVB was recorded with wide-bore tapered liners. For a milking unit fitted with a wide-bore tapered liner TVF was reduced and TVM increased by increasing either the bore of the short milk tube or the volume of the claw. When the bore of the LMT was increased TVB, TV and TVF increased. Simultaneous pulsation gave higher TVB (P < 0. 001) and higher TVF (P < 0. 001) than alternate pulsation for all cluster types. The overall effects of altering <b>pulsator</b> <b>ratio</b> were significant but small in practical terms. There were significant interactions between cluster type and water flow rate and pulsation pattern for TVB, TV, TVM and TVF. peer-reviewedEuropean Unio...|$|E
