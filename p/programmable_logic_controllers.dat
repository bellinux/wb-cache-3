5000|$|Struger is {{sometimes}} {{known as the}} [...] "father of the <b>programmable</b> <b>logic</b> controller" [...] as is Dick Morley.

Struger is often called the father of Allen-Bradley's <b>programmable</b> <b>logic</b> <b>controller</b> ("PLC") and credited with creating that acronym.

25|$|Industrial {{automation}} incorporates <b>programmable</b> <b>logic</b> <b>controllers</b> in {{the manufacturing}} process. <b>Programmable</b> <b>logic</b> <b>controllers</b> (PLCs) use a processing system which allows for variation of controls of inputs and outputs using simple programming. PLCs make use of programmable memory, storing instructions and functions like logic, sequencing, timing, counting, etc. Using a logic based language, a PLC can receive a variety of inputs and return a variety of logical outputs, the input devices being sensors and output devices being motors, valves, etc. PLCs are similar to computers, however, while computers are optimized for calculations, PLCs are optimized for control task and use in industrial environments. They are built so that only basic logic-based programming knowledge is needed and to handle vibrations, high temperatures, humidity and noise. The greatest advantage PLCs offer is their flexibility. With the same basic controllers, a PLC can operate a range of different control systems. PLCs make it unnecessary to rewire a system to change the control system. This flexibility leads to a cost-effective system for complex and varied control systems.|$|E
25|$|Most modern PID {{controllers}} {{in industry}} are implemented in {{distributed control systems}} (DCS), <b>programmable</b> <b>logic</b> <b>controllers</b> (PLCs), or as a panel-mounted digital controller. Software implementations have the advantages that they are relatively cheap and are flexible {{with respect to the}} implementation of the PID algorithm. PID temperature controllers are applied in industrial ovens, plastics injection machinery, hot-stamping machines and packing industry. PID controllers are at the core of multirotor drones as well, in the form of self-stabilising flight controllers.|$|E
25|$|Industrial {{automation}} deals {{primarily with}} the automation of manufacturing, quality control and material handling processes. General purpose controllers for industrial processes include <b>Programmable</b> <b>logic</b> <b>controllers,</b> stand-alone I/O modules, and computers. Industrial automation is {{to replace the}} decision making of humans and manual command-response activities {{with the use of}} mechanized equipment and logical programming commands. One trend is increased use of Machine vision to provide automatic inspection and robot guidance functions, another is a continuing increase in the use of robots. Industrial automation is simply done at the industrial level.|$|E

25|$|The 68000 {{also saw}} {{success in the}} field of {{industrial}} control systems. Among the systems benefited from having a 68000 or derivative as their microprocessor were families of <b>programmable</b> <b>logic</b> <b>controllers</b> (PLCs) manufactured by Allen-Bradley, Texas Instruments and subsequently, following the acquisition of that division of TI, by Siemens. Users of such systems do not accept product obsolescence {{at the same rate as}} domestic users, and it is entirely likely that despite having been installed over 20 years ago, many 68000-based controllers will continue in reliable service well into the 21st century.|$|E
25|$|Computers {{can perform}} both {{sequential}} control and feedback control, and typically a single computer will do both {{in an industrial}} application. <b>Programmable</b> <b>logic</b> <b>controllers</b> (PLCs) are a type of special purpose microprocessor that replaced many hardware components such as timers and drum sequencers used in relay logic type systems. General purpose process control computers have increasingly replaced stand alone controllers, with a single computer able to perform the operations of hundreds of controllers. Process control computers can process data from a network of PLCs, instruments and controllers in order to implement typical (such as PID) control of many individual variables or, in some cases, to implement complex control algorithms using multiple inputs and mathematical manipulations. They can also analyze data and create real time graphical displays for operators and run reports for operators, engineers and management.|$|E
25|$|Stuxnet {{specifically}} targets <b>programmable</b> <b>logic</b> <b>controllers</b> (PLCs), {{which allow}} the automation of electromechanical {{processes such as}} those used to control machinery on factory assembly lines, amusement rides, or centrifuges for separating nuclear material. Exploiting four zero-day flaws, Stuxnet functions by targeting machines using the Microsoft Windows operating system and networks, then seeking out Siemens Step7 software. Stuxnet reportedly compromised Iranian PLCs, collecting information on industrial systems and causing the fast-spinning centrifuges to tear themselves apart. Stuxnetâ€™s design and architecture are not domain-specific {{and it could be}} tailored as a platform for attacking modern supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and PLC systems (e.g., in factory assembly lines or power plants), the majority of which reside in Europe, Japan and the US. Stuxnet reportedly ruined almost one fifth of Iran's nuclear centrifuges. Targeting industrial control systems, the worm infected over 200,000 computers and caused 1,000 machines to physically degrade.|$|E
