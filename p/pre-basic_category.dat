40|$|In {{greenhouse}} potato cultivation, mineral nutrition {{is one of}} {{the main}} factors contributing to high yields and better product quality. Knowledge about the amount of nutrients accumulated in the plants at each growing phase provides important information that helps the establishment of a more balanced fertilizer application. The objective of this research was to determine the time course of macronutrients uptake and accumulation in potato plants for seed-tuber production, grown in nutrient solution. The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse, using in vitro material from the <b>pre-basic</b> <b>category</b> of the `Atlantic` variety. The plants were collected weekly from 14 days after transplanting (DAT) until 70 DAT The experimental design was a completely randomized block with 9 treatments to sampling times and four replicates. The highest nutrient requirement in the plant shoot occurred at the periods between 28 and 56 DAT while in the tubers it was after 49 DAT The maximum accumulation sequence of macronutrients was K > N > S > Ca > P > Mg...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} genotype, seed {{category}} and year on yield components (number of spikelets per spike, grain number per spike, grain weight per spike and thousand grain weight) for three wheat genotypes were studied during a two-year research. Genotype PKB Lepoklasa and seed <b>category</b> <b>pre-basic</b> seed {{had the highest}} values for {{the largest number of}} the studied traits, while the genotype BG Merkur and the certified seed of the first generation had the lowest values. Higher values for the studied traits were found in 2010, compared to 2009. AMMI analysis established a significant effect of the interaction of factors and main components (PCA 1 and PCA 2) for all investigated traits except thousand grain weight. The genotype PKB Talas was the most stable, while the genotype PKB Lepoklasa was the least stable. Seed categories certified seed of the first generation and basic seed had similar reactions to the interaction between factors...|$|R
