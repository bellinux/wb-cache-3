50|$|The lure {{of gold in}} the 1850s {{attracted}} many miners, hunters, and stocker raisers. Conflicts {{between white}} settlers and Native Americans culminated in the Rogue River Wars of 1855 - 56. After their defeat, Native Americans were taken to reservations. Mining remnants such as <b>pipe,</b> <b>flumes,</b> trestles, and stamp mills can still {{be found in the}} wilderness.|$|R
60|$|Hydraulic mining on the Gold Coast, {{owing to}} the {{conformation}} of the country, will be a far simpler and less expensive process than in California or Australia. In the latter water has first to be bought, and then to be brought in <b>pipes,</b> <b>flumes,</b> leats, or races from a considerable distance, sometimes extending over forty miles. It is necessary to make a reservoir for a fall. The water then rushes through the flexible hose, and is directed by a nozzle against {{the face of the}} excavation. The action is that of a fireman playing upon a burning house. Most works on mining insist upon those reservoirs, and never seem to think of washing from below by the force-pump.|$|R
50|$|As {{a matter}} of safety, there should be {{multiple}} drains in pools and public fountains, to help reduce dangers of <b>pipe</b> entubement and <b>flume</b> debunkment. In some locales, multiple drains are legally mandated on all public swimming pools, and this is becoming increasingly common in new construction residential pools.|$|R
50|$|The former {{generator}} {{building is}} reached via a single doorway {{at the rear}} of the entrance hallway, with another doorway on the first floor also located {{at the rear of}} the entrance hallway. Access to the former generator building was limited to a narrow walkway that leads to the rear of the building. The former generator building is a three-storey structure with a concrete floor covering part of the first floor level. The building contains the remains of the power plant, including steel <b>pipes,</b> fans and <b>fluming.</b>|$|R
500|$|The only {{artificial}} barrier on {{the main}} stem of the Rogue upstream of Lost Creek Lake is a diversion dam at Prospect at RM172 (RK277).

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{consists of}} {{a description of the}} legislative framework of small hydropower plants, which is necessary to know for their operation and construction. It also describes the general theory of small hydropower plants, specifically describes the individual technical elements - weir, gratings, sluice gates, ambushes, sand traps and stones, open <b>flume,</b> <b>pipes</b> and stilling basin. Another part assesses the economic feasibility of small hydropower plants for specific hydrological conditions and design of turbines on suitable work flow. The main part is devoted to specific proposal small hydropower plants in the village Tulešice by the river Rokytná...|$|R
40|$|At the Hydraulic Laboratory Graz, Austria, an UVP-Monitor {{was used}} to measure flow {{velocities}} in <b>pipes</b> and <b>flumes.</b> Moreover the same device was used for measuring the surface level in a flume. Velocity profile measurement was successfully conducted on a physical model of a multi-pipe inverted siphon with three Plexiglas pipes ranging from 62 mm to 246 mm in diameter. Turbulent flow within the pipes was studied under non-intrusive conditions by installing the ultrasonic transducer on the pipe wall. The velocity profiles were obtained by moving the transducer around the pipe to four angles (0 °, 45 °, 90 °, 135 °). Measurements in a flume included simultaneous measurement of velocity profiles and fluid surface profiles for wavy flows. These experiments were performed in a horizontal glass channel. The transducer was inserted from above the test section into the medium facing the direction of flow. The transducer axis was placed at various angles {{to the surface of the}} water. In the same horizontal channel, water level measurement for wavy flow was performed. 1. TESTS ON PIPE FLOW 1. 1 Model stan...|$|R
40|$|Study Objective: The {{objective}} of this applied research was to explore the interaction between effluent sediment concentration and turbidity for sediment controls that are currently being implemented at construction sites. Turbidity can be continuously monitored through an effluent <b>pipe,</b> a <b>flume</b> or in the receiving stream. Monitoring throughout a storm event enables making a more informed decision about {{the potential impact of}} effluent on the receiving waters. The impact of Total Suspended Solids (TSS) on various aquatic invertebrates and fish has been extensively documented for certain species. Additionally, the relationship between stream TSS and other environmental factors such as light penetration, growth of aquatic plants, temperature, etc. has been developed for some streams and lakes. If a reliable relationship can be developed between turbidity (TUR) and either suspended sediment concentration (SSC), measured in terms of the mass of sediment in the entire sample, or TSS, then turbidity can be potentially used as a surrogate enabling monitoring that can be readily accomplished at a construction site discharge point. Regulatory Setting: Many government entities are now considering a maximum sedimen...|$|R
50|$|Named tributaries of the Middle Fork Rogue River from {{source to}} mouth are Honeymoon, Halifax, Bessie, Twentynine, Svinth, Daniel, and Red Blanket creeks. In addition, {{water from the}} Middle Fork is {{diverted}} to a Rogue River dam and reservoir at Prospect that impounds water from the Rogue and nearby streams and diverts it to power plants. PacifiCorp operates this system, called The Prospect Nos. 1, 2, and 4 Hydroelectric Project. Built in pieces between 1911 and 1944, it includes separate diversion dams on the Middle Fork Rogue River and Red Blanket Creek, and a 9.25 mi water-transport system of canals, <b>flumes,</b> <b>pipes,</b> and penstocks.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the dams on the Rogue main stem, {{at one time or}} another [...] "several hundred dams were built on tributaries within the range of salmon migration", most of which supplied water for mining or irrigation. Before 1920, many of these dams made no provision for fish passage; public pressure as well as efforts by turn-of-the-century cannery owner R.D. Hume led to the installation of fish ladders on the most destructive dams. As of 2005, there were about 80 non-hydroelectric dams, mostly small irrigation structures, in the Rogue basin. In {{addition to}} Lost Creek Lake on the main stem, large reservoirs in the basin include Applegate Lake, Emigrant Lake, and Fish Lake.The only artificial barrier on the main stem of the Rogue upstream of Lost Creek Lake is a diversion dam at Prospect at RM 172 (RK 277). The concrete dam, 50 ft high and 384 ft wide, impounds water from the Rogue and nearby streams and diverts it to power plants, which return the water to the river further downstream.
