25|$|After {{delivering}} the verdict in his trial, {{all of the}} jurors swore that to their knowledge Arthur Hodge held no property in the British Virgin Islands. This was patently not true, but allowed the court to avoid condemning his property, and allowed his estate to pass to his 6 year old son, Henry Cecil Hodge (Arthur Hodge had adopted a new will leaving his estate to his son during the disputes with Musgrave and Martin which led to his execution, {{although there is no}} suggestion that he feared for his life at this time). Years later the Hodge estate burned down, and son Henry Cecil Hodge remarked that he would be <b>paying</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>for</b> his father's sins forever.|$|E

25|$|Allegations of {{corruption}} {{were made on}} the basis of the price paid by Iberia and the Spanish firm's ulterior conduct (including some convoluted lease-back operations), with the airline <b>paying</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>for</b> its own purchase with its assets. Subsequent management by American Airlines and SEPI drove Aerolíneas Argentinas into an almost terminal crisis in 2001. In , the aftermath began after the airline filed for bankruptcy protection from creditors, and went into administration; the salaries were paid by the Argentine Government, instead of using money coming from the SEPI. The payment of salaries for the upcoming months was suspended, as the mechanics union refused to accept the reorganisation plan raised by the SEPI to keep the company afloat. On 6 June, flights to Auckland, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, São Paulo, Sydney and Rio de Janeiro were halted. Owing to a million debt with the fuel supplier, the suspension of the daily flight to Madrid, which also served Rome and was the last connection with Europe, followed a week later. After this, most of the fleet was grounded, and only 30% and 10% of domestic and international flights, respectively, were operating.|$|E

[...] Prosecutor Vincent Cohen, who had recommended 18 months in prison, stated [...] "Mr. Gonzalez is now <b>paying</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>for</b> his foolish decision to jump the fence and run inside the White House.
