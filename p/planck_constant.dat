5|$|As may be {{observed}} in the table below, the main limiting factor in the precision of the Avogadro constant is the uncertainty {{in the value of}} the <b>Planck</b> <b>constant,</b> as all the other constants that contribute to the calculation are known more precisely.|$|E

5|$|The {{accuracy}} of the measured value of the Avogadro constant is currently limited by the uncertainty {{in the value of}} the Planck constant—a measure relating the energy of photons to their frequency. That relative standard uncertainty has been 50parts per billion (ppb) since 2006. By fixing the Avogadro constant, the practical effect of this proposal would be that the uncertainty in the mass of a 12C atom—and the magnitude of the kilogram—could be no better than the current 50ppb uncertainty in the <b>Planck</b> <b>constant.</b> Under this proposal, the magnitude of the kilogram would be subject to future refinement as improved measurements of the value of the <b>Planck</b> <b>constant</b> become available; electronic realizations of the kilogram would be recalibrated as required. Conversely, an electronic definition of the kilogram (see Electronic approaches, below), which would precisely fix the <b>Planck</b> <b>constant,</b> would continue to allow 83⅓ moles of 12C to have a mass of precisely one kilogram but the number of atoms comprising a mole (the Avogadro constant) would continue to be subject to future refinement.|$|E

40|$|We {{trace the}} {{historical}} appearance of <b>Planck's</b> <b>constant</b> in physics, and {{we note that}} initially the constant did not appear in connection with quanta. Furthermore, we emphasize that <b>Planck's</b> <b>constant</b> can appear in both classical and quantum theories. In both theories, <b>Planck's</b> <b>constant</b> sets the scale of atomic phenomena. However, the roles played in {{the foundations of the}} theories are sharply different. In quantum theory, <b>Planck's</b> <b>constant</b> is crucial to the structure of the theory. On the other hand, in classical electrodynamics, <b>Planck's</b> <b>constant</b> is optional, since it appears only as the scale factor for the (homogeneous) source-free contribution to the general solution of Maxwell's equations. Since classical electrodynamics can be solved while taking the homogenous source-free contribution in the solution as zero or non-zero, there are naturally two different theories of classical electrodynamics, one in which <b>Planck's</b> <b>constant</b> is taken as zero and one where it is taken as non-zero. The textbooks of classical electromagnetism present only the version in which <b>Planck's</b> <b>constant</b> is taken to vanish. Comment: 9 page...|$|R

5|$|It is {{expected}} that {{the definition of the}} kilogram and several other units will change on May 20, 2019, following a final vote by the CGPM in November 2018.

5|$|The {{definition}} of the kilogram is undergoing a fundamental change—the current definition defines the kilogram as being {{the mass of the}} international prototype kilogram which is an artefact, not a constant of nature while the new definition relates it to the equivalent energy of a photon via the <b>Planck</b> <b>constant.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{measurements}} use highly polished {{spheres of}} silicon {{with a mass}} of one kilogram. Spheres are used to simplify the measurement of the size (and hence the density) and to minimize {{the effect of the}} oxide coating that inevitably forms on the surface. The first measurements used spheres of silicon with natural isotopic composition, and had a relative uncertainty of 3.1. These first results were also inconsistent with values of the <b>Planck</b> <b>constant</b> derived from watt balance measurements, although the source of the discrepancy is now believed to be known.|$|E
5|$|The {{virtue of}} {{electronic}} realizations like the Kibble balance {{is that the}} definition and dissemination of the kilogram {{would no longer be}} dependent upon the stability of kilogram prototypes, which must be very carefully handled and stored. It would free physicists from the need to rely on assumptions about the stability of those prototypes. Instead, hand-tuned, close-approximation mass standards would simply be weighed and documented as being equal to one kilogram plus an offset value. With the Kibble balance, while the kilogram would be delineated in electrical and gravity terms, all of which are traceable to invariants of nature; it would be defined {{in a manner that is}} directly traceable to just three fundamental constants of nature. The <b>Planck</b> <b>constant</b> defines the kilogram in terms of the second and the metre. By fixing the <b>Planck</b> <b>constant,</b> the definition of the kilogram would depend only on the definitions of the second and the metre. The definition of the second depends on a single defined physical constant: the ground state hyperfine splitting frequency of the caesium 133 atom Δν(133Cs)hfs. The metre depends on the second and on an additional defined physical constant: the speed of light c. If the kilogram is redefined in this manner, mass artifacts—physical objects calibrated in a Kibble balance, including the IPK—would no longer be part of the definition, but would instead become transfer standards.|$|E
5|$|The International Prototype Kilogram was {{commissioned}} by the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) {{under the authority of}} the Metre Convention (1875), and in the custody of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) who hold it on behalf of the CGPM. After the International Prototype Kilogram had been found to vary in mass over time relative to its reproductions, the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) recommended in 2005 that the kilogram be redefined in terms of a fundamental constant of nature. At its 2011 meeting, the CGPM agreed in principle that the kilogram should be redefined in terms of the <b>Planck</b> <b>constant.</b> The decision was originally deferred until 2014; in 2014 it was deferred again until the next meeting. There are currently several different proposals for the redefinition (some of which have been abandoned); these are described in the Proposed Future Definitions section below.|$|E

5|$|Concerns {{have been}} {{expressed}} {{that the use}} of explicit-constant definitions of the unit being defined that are not related to an example of its quantity will have many adverse effects. Although this criticism applies to the proposed linking of the kilogram to the <b>Planck</b> <b>constant</b> via a route that requires a knowledge of both special relativity and quantum mechanics, it does not apply to the proposed definition of the ampere, which is closer to an example of its quantity than is the current definition. Some observers have welcomed the proposal to base the definition of electric current on the charge of the electron rather than the current definition of a force between two parallel current-carrying wires – since the nature of the electromagnetic interaction between two bodies at the quantum electrodynamics level is somewhat different from the nature at classical electrodynamic levels, it is considered inappropriate to use classical electrodynamics to define quantities that exist at quantum electrodynamic levels.|$|E
5|$|The {{challenge}} with Kibble balances {{is not only}} in reducing their uncertainty, but also in making them truly practical realizations of the kilogram. Nearly every aspect of Kibble balances and their support equipment requires such extraordinarily precise and accurate, state-of-the-art technology that—unlike a device like an atomic clock—few countries would currently choose to fund their operation. For instance, the NIST's Kibble balance used four resistance standards in 2007, each of which was rotated through the Kibble balance every two to six weeks after being calibrated in {{a different part of}} NIST headquarters facility in Gaithersburg, Maryland. It was found that simply moving the resistance standards {{down the hall to the}} Kibble balance after calibration altered their values 10ppb (equivalent to 10µg) or more. Present-day technology is insufficient to permit stable operation of Kibble balances between even biannual calibrations. If the kilogram is defined in terms of the <b>Planck</b> <b>constant,</b> it is likely there will only be a few—at most—Kibble balances initially operating in the world.|$|E

It is used in the most accurate available measurements of the magnetic flux quantum Φ0=h/(2e), where h is the <b>Planck</b> <b>constant.</b> Coupled with the quantum Hall resistivity, this leads to a precise measurement of the <b>Planck</b> <b>constant.</b> Josephson was awarded the Nobel Prize for this work in 1973.|$|E

Molecular spectroscopy of dinitrogen (14N2) showed that transitions originating from even-numbered rotational levels are more intense than those from odd levels, hence the even levels are more populated. According to quantum mechanics and the Pauli exclusion principle, the spin of the 14N nucleus is therefore an integer multiple of ħ (the reduced <b>Planck</b> <b>constant).</b> Yet both protons and electrons carry an intrinsic spin of ½ħ, {{and there is no}} way to arrange an odd number (14 protons + 7 electrons = 21) of spins ±½ħ to give a spin that is an integer multiple of ħ.|$|E

This approach provides new insight into failures of various formalisms dealing with mixed quantum-classical systems. It shows that in the interacting mixed quantum-classical description, there can be no back-reaction of the quantum system on the classical. A natural algebraic requirement involving restriction of the tensor product of two quantum Hamilton algebras to their components proves that <b>Planck's</b> <b>constant</b> is unique.

This resolution was accepted by the 24th conference of the CGPM in October 2011 and further discussed at the 25th conference in 2014. Although the Committee recognised that significant progress had been made, they concluded that the data did not appear sufficiently robust to adopt the revised definition, and that work should continue to enable the adoption at the 26th meeting, scheduled for 2018.
