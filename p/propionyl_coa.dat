50|$|Propionyl-CoA {{carboxylase}} catalyses the carboxylation {{reaction of}} <b>propionyl</b> <b>CoA</b> in the mitochondrial matrix. The enzyme is biotin-dependent. The {{product of the}} reaction is (S)-methylmalonyl CoA. <b>Propionyl</b> <b>CoA</b> is the end product of metabolism of odd-chain fatty acids, and is also a metabolite of most methyl-branched fatty acids. It is also the main metabolite of valine, and together with acetyl-CoA, is a metabolite of isoleucine, {{as well as a}} methionine metabolite. Propionyl-CoA is thus of great importance as a glucose precursor. (S)-Methylmalonyl-CoA is not directly utilizable by animals; it is acted on by a racemase to give (R)-methylmalonyl-CoA. The latter is converted by methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (one of a very few Vitamin B12-dependent enzymes) to give succinyl-CoA. The latter is converted to oxaloacetate and then malate in the Krebs cycle. Export of malate into the cytosol leads to formation of oxaloacetate, phosphoenol pyruvate, and other gluconeogenic intermediates.|$|E
40|$|Propionic acidemia is an {{autosomal}} recessively inherited {{disorder of}} organic acid metabolism caused by deficient activity of <b>propionyl</b> <b>CoA</b> carboxylase. This enzyme {{is required for}} the catabolism of the odd-chain fatty acids, the side chain of cholesterol and the amino acids: isoleucine, methionine, and threonine. Although the clinical expression of this disorder is variable, affected children usually develop ketoacidosis and hyperammonemia which may progress to seizures, coma and possibly death. Some patients may exhibit vomiting, lethargy and hypotonia in the first few weeks of life whereas others may remain asymptomatic for months or even years. (1) The degree of residual enzyme activity in the tissues from these patients does not correlate to this apparent clinical heterogeneity. The relationship between the clinical variation observed among <b>propionyl</b> <b>CoA</b> carboxylase deficient patients and the corresponding genetic and biochemical make up, is not yet understood. The aim of this project is to study the biochemical and immunological properties of <b>propionyl</b> <b>CoA</b> carboxylase in liver homogenates and fibroblast samples from several patients with propionic acidemia, {{to gain a better understanding}} of the nature of the defect in this disorder. Previous comparisons of <b>propionyl</b> <b>CoA</b> carboxylase from fibroblasts of patients with this enzyme deficiency and unaffected individuals have suggested that <b>propionyl</b> <b>CoA</b> carboxylase is structurally altered in the patients with propionic acidemia. The fibroblast lines from these patients can be categorized into two major genetic complementation groups, pccA and pccBC based on the increase in activity observed in heterokaryons formed by pairwise cell fusions. (2) In addition, the defective <b>propionyl</b> <b>CoA</b> carboxylase can be differentiated biochemically from the normal enzyme and from each compIementation group. (3) These differences suggest that the aIterations in <b>propionyl</b> <b>CoA</b> carboxylase structure in each complementation group represent mutations in different subunits. In addition, mutations within a single gene resulting slightly different enzyme structures, would explain the clinical variation within a complementation group. Therefore, biochemical differences among mutant <b>propionyl</b> <b>CoA</b> carboxylases from the same c 0 mp 1 ementation group were investigated. To provide further evidence that propionic acidemia is the result of structural alterations in <b>propionyl</b> <b>CoA</b> carboxylase, immunologic techniques were used to determine if equal quantities of cross-reacting material (CRM) were present in liver and fibrobiast homogenates from <b>propionyl</b> <b>CoA</b> carboxyIase deficient patients from the various genetic complementation groups. Antiserum prepared against purified pig heart <b>propionyl</b> <b>CoA</b> carboxylase which cross-reacts with human propionyI CoA carboxyIase and another antiserum prepared against the human biotin-containing enzymes, were compared using immunotitration techniques. These tests demonstrated that there are equal quantities of cross-reacting material in the tissue homogenates of propionic acidemia patients. (4, 5) Investigations were undertaken to biochemically characterize and evaluate the heterogeneity within the pccBC genetic complementation group. This group was chosen because previous complementation and biochemical studies with fibroblasts from the pccBC subgroups have suggested the existence of interallelic complementation in this group. (6) Specific biochemical differences among <b>propionyl</b> <b>CoA</b> carboxylases from cells belonging to patients in this group could identify heterogeneity and characterize the complementation pattern. Normal and mutant <b>propionyl</b> <b>CoA</b> carboxylase from the pccBC complementation group were highly purified and their biochemical properties were compared using their isoelectric paint, thermostabiilty, and enzyme affinity for substrates. The properties of the purified enzymes were then compared with <b>propionyl</b> <b>CoA</b> carboxylase from other mutants in this group. These comparisons demonstrated biochemical heterogeneity within the pccBC complementation group. (7) The results provide compelling evidence that the defect in propionic acidemia represents a structural alteration of <b>propionyl</b> <b>CoA</b> carboxylase in the pccA and pccBC complementation groups. In addition, the biochemical heterogeneity demonstrated within the pccBC complementation group suggests that several different structural mutations, possibly of the same subunit, are involved that result in slightly different biochemical parameters for each mutant enzyme. These structural alterations may explain the complicated complementation map for the pccBC subgroups. Since interallelic complementation is based on the heteropolymer being slightly more active than the homopolymer, different structural alterations in the mutants may interfere with their ability to participate in interallelic complementation. Furthermore, biochemical differences within the group may be reflected in the clinical phenotype of the disease and may be an indicator of the clinical variation which has been observed in these patients...|$|E

Rats injected with 10 or 20 mmol/kg of propionate or 20 mmol/kg of methylmalonate, along with 1. 5 g/kg of a mixture of amino acids, developed severe hyperammonemia, whereas rats administered the same dosages of acetate did not. In vitro, neither <b>propionyl</b> nor methylmalonyl <b>CoA</b> affected the activity of carbamyl phosphate synthetase I, ornithine transcarbamylase, nor the activation constant (KA) of carbamyl phosphate synthetase I for N-acetyl glutamate. Furthermore, rats injected with propionate showed no alteration of liver amino acid concentrations, which could explain impaired ureagenesis. Animals injected with methylmalonate showed an increase in both citrulline and aspartate, suggesting that argininosuccinic acid synthetase may also have been inhibited. Liver ATP levels were unchanged. Citrullinogenesis, measured in intact mitochondria from livers of injected animals, was reduced 20 - 25 % by 20 mmol/kg of propionate or methylmalonate (compared with acetate). This effect was attributable to an impairment in the normal rise of liver N-acetyl glutamate content after amino acid injection. Thus, carbamyl phosphate synthetase I activation was reduced. Liver levels of acetyl CoA and free CoA were reduced. Levels of unidentified acyl CoA derivatives rose, presumably reflecting the accumulation of <b>propionyl</b> and methylmalonyl <b>CoA.</b> Thus, the principal mechanism for hyperammonemia induced by these acids is depletion of liver N-acetyl glutamate, which is in turn attributable to depletion of acetyl CoA and/or competitive inhibition by <b>propionyl</b> and methylmalonyl <b>CoA</b> of N-acetyl glutamate synthetase. Injection of methylmalonate may also have an additional inhibitory effect on argininosuccinic acid synthetase...|$|R

Recombinant strains containing plasmids carrying dpsC and dpsD, in addition to other daunorubicin polyketide synthase (PKS) genes, incorporate the correct starter unit into polyketides made by these genes, suggesting that, contrary to earlier reports, the enzymes encoded by dpsC and dpsD {{play a crucial role in}} starter unit specification. Additionally, the results of a cell-free synthesis of 21 -carbon polyketides from propionyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA that used the protein extracts of recombinant strains carrying other daunorubicin PKS genes to which purified DpsC was added suggest that this enzyme has the primary role in starter unit discrimination for daunorubicin biosynthesis...|$|R
40|$|Fibroblast {{extracts}} and {{fetal liver}} homogenates from patients with propionic acidemia due to inherited deficiency of <b>propionyl</b> <b>CoA</b> carboxylase (PCC) were analyzed {{for the presence}} of immunologically cross-reactive PCC protein. Using several rabbit antisera raised against homogeneous human liver PCC, homogeneous pig heart PCC, or the individual non-identical subunits of the human liver enzyme, we found no detectable cross-reacting material by direct or competitive immunotitration in several cell lines from patients in either major complementation group (pcc A; pcc C) with isolated PCC deficiency. In contrast, cells of a patient from the bio complementation group contained normal amounts of immunoreactive PCC. Further analysis of the pcc A and pcc C mutants revealed that their residual <b>propionyl</b> <b>CoA</b> carboxylating activity varied greatly depending on the concentration of extract or homogenate protein used in the PCC assay. When <b>propionyl</b> <b>CoA</b> carboxylation was assayed at high protein concentration in a fetal liver homogenate from a pcc C patient, the apparent PCC activity was comparable to that found in normal human fetal liver. Significantly, the specific activity in the mutant, but not in the control, extract declined steeply as protein concentration was lowered, and this loss could not be prevented by adding PCC substrates, bovine serum albumin, glycerol, or 2 -mercaptoethanol. Moreover, detailed analyses of immunotitration curves of control fibroblasts extracts showed that fresh extracts contained an amount of nonimmunotitratable carboxylating activity corresponding to the residual activity present in fresh extracts of mutant cell lines. We conclude that the residual <b>propionyl</b> <b>CoA</b> carboxylating activity found in isolated PCC deficiency represents another carboxylase that can utilize <b>propionyl</b> <b>CoA</b> as a substrate rather than a mutant form of PCC with markedly different immunochemical and physicochemical properties...|$|E

40|$|Acetylation of lysine {{residues}} is a posttranslational modification {{that is used}} by both eukaryotes and prokaryotes {{to regulate}} a variety of biological processes. Here we identify multiple substrates for the cAMP-dependent protein lysine acetyltransferase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (KATmt).

A sirtuin-like enzyme can deacetylate multiple FadDs, thus completing the regulatory cycle.

40|$|Two genes, accB and accE, {{that form}} {{part of the same}} operon, were cloned from Streptomyces coelicolor A 3 (2). AccB is {{homologous}} to the carboxyl transferase domain of several <b>propionyl</b> coezyme A (<b>CoA)</b> carboxylases and acyl-CoA carboxylases (ACCases) of actinomycete origin, while AccE shows no significant homology to any known protein. Expression of accB and accE in Escherichia coli and subsequent in vitro reconstitution of enzyme activity {{in the presence of the}} biotinylated protein AccA 1 or AccA 2 confirmed that AccB was the carboxyl transferase subunit of an ACCase. The additional presence of AccE considerably enhanced the activity of the enzyme complex, suggesting that this small polypeptide is a functional component of the ACCase. The impossibility of obtaining an accB null mutant and the thiostrepton growth dependency of a tipAp accB conditional mutant confirmed that AccB is essential for S. coelicolor viability. Normal growth phenotype in the absence of the inducer was restored in the conditional mutant by the addition of exogenous long-chain fatty acids in the medium, indicating that the inducer-dependent phenotype was specifically related to a conditional block in fatty acid biosynthesis. Thus, AccB, together with AccA 2, which is also an essential protein (E. Rodriguez and H. Gramajo, Microbiology 143 : 3109 â 3119, 1999), are the most likely components of an ACCase whose main physiological role is the synthesis of malonyl-CoA, the first committed step of fatty acid synthesis.

Genes for the lower pathway in 2, 4 -DNT degradation were found downstream from dntD, the gene encoding the extradiol ring fission enzyme of the pathway. The region includes genes encoding a CoA-dependent methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (dntE), a putative NADH-dependent dehydrogenase (ORF 13), and a bifunctional isomerase/hydrolase (dntG). Results from analysis of the gene sequence, reverse transcriptase PCR, and enzyme assays indicated that dntD dntE ORF 13 dntG composes an operon that encodes the lower pathway. Additional genes that were uncovered encode the 2, 4 -DNT dioxygenase (dntAaAbAcAd), methylnitrocatechol monooxygenase (dntB), a putative LysR-type transcriptional (ORF 12) regulator, an intradiol ring cleavage enzyme (ORF 3), a maleylacetate reductase (ORF 10), a complete ABC transport complex (ORF 5 to ORF 8), a putative methyl-accepting chemoreceptor protein (ORF 11), and remnants from two transposable elements. Some of the additional gene products might play as-yet-undefined roles in 2, 4 -DNT degradation; others appear to remain from recruitment of the neighboring genes.

40|$|Abstract Background Propionic acidaemia (PA) {{results from}} {{deficiency}} of <b>Propionyl</b> <b>CoA</b> carboxylase, the commonest form presenting in the neonatal period. Despite best current management, PA {{is associated with}} severe neurological sequelae, in particular movement disorders resulting from basal ganglia infarction, although the pathogenesis remains poorly understood. The role of liver transplantation remains controversial but may confer some neuro-protection. The present study utilises quantitative magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to investigate brain metabolite alterations in propionic acidaemia during metabolic stability and acute encephalopathic episodes. Methods Quantitative MRS {{was used to evaluate}} brain metabolites in eight children with neonatal onset propionic acidaemia, with six elective studies acquired during metabolic stability and five studies during acute encephalopathic episodes. MRS studies were acquired concurrently with clinically indicated MR imaging studies at 1. 5 Tesla. LCModel software was used to provide metabolite quantification. Comparison was made with a dataset of MRS metabolite concentrations from a cohort of children with normal appearing MR imaging. Results MRI findings confirm the vulnerability of basal ganglia to infarction during acute encephalopathy. We identified statistically significant decreases in basal ganglia glutamate+glutamine and N-Acetylaspartate, and increase in lactate, during encephalopathic episodes. In white matter lactate was significantly elevated but other metabolites not significantly altered. Metabolite data from two children who had received liver transplantation were not significantly different from the comparator group. Conclusions The metabolite alterations seen in propionic acidaemia in the basal ganglia during acute encephalopathy reflect loss of viable neurons, and a switch to anaerobic respiration. The decrease in glutamine + glutamate supports the hypothesis that they are consumed to replenish a compromised Krebs cycle and that this is a marker of compromised aerobic respiration within brain tissue. Thus {{there is a need for}} improved brain protective strategies during acute metabolic decompensations. MRS provides a non-invasive tool for which could be employed to evaluate novel treatments aimed at restoring basal ganglia homeostasis. The results from the liver transplantation sub-group supports the hypothesis that liver transplantation provides systemic metabolic stability by providing a hepatic pool of functional <b>propionyl</b> <b>CoA</b> carboxylase, thus preventing further acute decompensations which are associated with the risk of brain infarction. </p...|$|E

Alleles carrying mutations p. R 410 W and p. W 531 X are able to complement with 10 out of 11 amino-terminal mutations assayed. Only the unstable p. R 512 C, p. L 519 P and p.

In order to optimise chemotherapy, {{it is important}} to understand the mechanisms of regulation of histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes and modifications brought by various HDIs. In the present study, we have employed Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy (FT-IRMS) to evaluate modifications in cellular macromolecules subsequent to treatment with various HDIs. In addition to CH 3 (methyl) stretching bands at 2872 and 2960 cm 1, which arises due to acetylation, we also found major changes in bands at 2851 and 2922 cm 1, which originates from stretching vibrations of CH 2 (methylene) groups, in valproic acid treated cells. We further demonstrate that the changes in CH 2 stretching are concentration-dependent and also induced by several other HDIs. Recently, HDIs have been shown to induce propionylation besides acetylation [1]. Since propionylation involves CH 2 groups, we hypothesized that CH 2 vibrational frequency changes seen in HDI treated cells could arise due to propionylation. As verification, pre-treatment of cells with <b>propionyl</b> <b>CoA</b> synthetase inhibitor resulted in loss of CH 2 vibrational changes in histones, purified from valproic acid treated cells.

[1]. When we studied the kinetics of complementation, we detected three distinct patterns using the [1 - 14 C]propionate utilization assay. When either pcc A or pcc C lines were fused to bio cells, 14 C-fixation increased to half of the maximally restored values within 4 hrs. In pcc A x pcc C crosses or in pcc A x pcc B crosses, however, complementation was much slower. In fusions between pcc B and pcc C cells, a third pattern was elicited; complementation was incomplete, maximum restoration of PCC activity begin less than 20 % of that observed in other complementing crosses. From these data and previous biochemical evidence, we suggest (1) that the bio and pcc mutations affect different genes; (2) that complementation between pcc A and either pcc B, pcc C, or pcc BC lines is intergenic and involves subunit exchange and synthesis of new PCC molecules; and (3) that complementation between pcc B and pcc C mutants is interallelic...|$|E
40|$|We have {{characterized}} {{further the}} molecular basis of human inherited <b>propionyl</b> <b>CoA</b> carboxylase deficiency by measuring steady state {{levels of the}} mRNAs coding for the enzyme's two protein subunits (alpha and beta) and by estimating initial synthesis and steady state levels of the protein subunits in skin fibroblasts from controls and affected patients. We studied cell lines from both major complementation groups (pccA and pccBC) corresponding, respectively, to defects in the carboxylase's alpha and beta subunits. Analysis of pccA lines revealed the absence of alpha chain mRNA in three and an abnormally small alpha-mRNA in a fourth. Despite the presence of normal beta-mRNA {{in each of these}} pccA lines, there was complete absence of both alpha and beta protein subunits under steady state conditions, even though new synthesis and mitochondrial import of beta precursors was normal. Results in nine pccBC lines revealed normal alpha mRNA in each, while the amounts of beta-mRNA were distinctly reduced in every case. Correspondingly, alpha protein subunits were present in normal amounts at steady-state, but beta subunits were uniformly decreased. In addition, in six of the nine beta deficient cell lines, partially degraded beta-subunits were observed. To help interpret these results, synthesis and stability of carboxylase subunits were studied in intact HeLa cells using a pulse-chase protocol. Whereas alpha chains were stable over the four hour interval studied, beta chains [...] initially synthesized in large excess over alpha chains [...] were degraded rapidly reaching equivalence with alpha chains after two hours.

40|$|Background: Propionic aciduria (PA) and Methymalonic aciduria (MMA) {{result from}} an {{inherited}} abnormality of the enzymes <b>propionyl</b> <b>CoA</b> carboxylase and methylmalonyl CoA mutase respectively. This produces marked {{increases in the}} amino acids methionine, threonine, valine and isoleucine (MTVI). Their clinical presentation can be neonatal or late onset forms. Aim: To report 23 children with organic acidurias. Material and methods: Twenty three cases of organic acidurias diagnosed since 1980 (17 PA and 6 MMA) and followed at the Institute of Nutrition and Food Technology, are reported. Results: The average age of diagnosis was 3. 9 days for the neonatal form and 8. 3 months for the late onset form. The most frequent symptoms were hypotonia, lethargy and vomiting. Neonatal PA had mean ammonemias of 1089 Â± 678. 3 Âµg/dl. The figure for MMA was 933 Â± 801. 9 Âµg/dl. Seven children were dialyzed and 30 % died. 16 children are followed and 81. 2 % have normal weight for age. Seven children required gastrostomy because of anorexia and failure to thrive. The nutritional treatment is based on natural and artificial proteins without MTVI, with periodical controls, amino acid and ammonia quantification. Some patients were submitted to enzyme assays and molecular studies. Conclusions: An early diagnosis and a very strict follow up allows a normal development of children with organic aciduras. There is a relationship between prognosis and the presentation form, the nutritional status and the emergency treatment during acute episodes. The importance of the enzymatic and molecular studies is emphasized because they facilitate treatment, accurate diagnosis and allow an adequate genetic counseling (Rev MÃ©d Chile 2002; 130 : 259 - 66...|$|E
40|$|Three biotin-dependent enzymes, {{pyruvate}} carboxylase (PC), <b>propionyl</b> <b>CoA</b> carboxylase (PCC), and beta-methylcrotonyl CoA carboxylase (beta MCC), were biochemically characterized in fibroblasts from two patients with neonatal multiple carboxylase deficiency. Genetic complementation analyses indicated that both cell lines, designated lines 1 and 2, were deficient {{in the various}} carboxylase activities and belonged to the bio complementation group. The activities of the three carboxylases became normal when line 2 cells were incubated in medium supplemented with biotin (1 mg/l) for 24 hrs, whereas 4 - 6 days were required to achieve maximum activities of PC, PCC, and beta MCC (57 %, 46 %, and 29 % of mean normal enzyme activity, respectively) in line 1 cells incubated in medium containing up to 10 mg/ 1 biotin. Furthermore, PC activity in line 2 continued to increase under apparent gluconeogenic conditions in culture, but not in line 1. Thermostability studies suggested that biotin stabilizes PC and beta MCC in both cell lines. PC in line 1 cells incubated with or without biotin was less stable than that in normal or line 2 cells, and the less than normal increase of enzyme activities in line 1, especially that of PC, may represent incomplete biotination. These results indicate that there is biochemical heterogeneity within the bio complementation group. Immunotitration with antibodies prepared against purified pig heart PCC demonstrated normal quantities of cross-reacting material in both lines and no differences {{in the amount of}} this material after incubation with supplemental biotin, despite the seven- to 20 -fold increase in PCC activity. Thus, the increase in carboxylase activity in both bio lines appears to represent activation of rpe-existing apocarboxylase rather than de novo enzyme synthesis. The primary defect in this form of multiple carboxylase deficiency may be in a common holocarboxylase synthetase or in biotin transport. If the defect is in the synthetase, the differences noted between the two bio lines could be explained by a difference in the enzyme's Km for biotin...|$|E
40|$|Recombinant serine acetyltransferase was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and {{purified}} 13 -fold to homogeneity. The {{specific activity}} of the purified enzyme was 719 units/mg. Hydrodynamic and quasi-elastic light scattering studies indicated that SAT has an open hexameric quaternary structure, furthermore, chemical cross-linking studies indicated that the fundamental building block is a trimer. Steady-state and stopped-flow kinetic studies indicated that the forward reaction proceeds via a ternary complex, and dead-end inhibition analyses indicated that the order of substrate addition was random. Substrate inhibition by serine indicated that {{the breakdown of the}} SAT-CoA complex is partially rate-determining, whereas the linearity of primary double-reciprocal plots and inhibition replots suggested that the interconversion of ternary complexes is not significantly faster than kcat. Hence the kinetic data is consistent with a steady-state random-order reaction mechanism in which the interconversion of ternary complexes and the dissociation of CoA may be both partially rate-determining. Steady-state kinetic studies with the alternative acyl acceptor threonine were consistent with such a mechanism, whereas, those with <b>propionyl</b> <b>CoA</b> satisfied the requirements of a rapid-equilibrium random-order reaction mechanism. Steady-state kinetic studies of the reverse reaction were consistent with a steady-state random-order reaction mechanism for SAT in which the breakdown of the enzyme-serine complex is partially rate-determining. Calorimetric titration data indicated that cysteine does not bind at the coenzyme binding site and may not bind at the serine binding site; hence it may bind at an allosteric site. The pH dependence of kcat/Km suggested that a base, with a pK in the region of 6, might have a role in catalysis. Chemical modification of all three cysteines in SAT by [14 C]- iodoacetamide demonstrated that the enzyme exists in the fully reduced state. Furthermore, SAT was irreversibly inhibited by iodoacetamide and substrates conferred protection against such inhibition. Silica thin layer eletrophoresis demonstrated the labelling of both histidine and cysteine in native and denatured preparations of [14 C]-iodoacetamide-modified SAT.

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} {{to examine the effects}} of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and dexamethasone on osteoblast differentiation and function in fetal rat calvaria cells (FRCC) since these cells are commonly used as a model for studying the differentiation and function of osteoblasts. The results showed that PUFA type and level influenced in vitro nodule formation. PUFA effects on the expression of core binding factor alpha 1 (Cbfa 1), a key transcription factor in osteoblast differentiation, revealed that both linoleic acid (LA) and arachidonic acid (AA) increased its protein level. Fatty acid analysis revealed that LA and AA were significantly enriched in the FRCC after 7 days of treatment and modified the fatty acid composition of these cells. Both LA and AA treatments significantly increased the levels of AA. It is believed that a higher level of AA would lead to greater PGE 2 production, which has been shown to stimulate Cbfa 1 expression. ^ Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis is a major health problem in the United States. In another series of experiments with FRCC, dexamethasone (DEX, a strong glucocorticoid) at a concentration of 10 - 7 M was found to stimulate nodule formation and the expression of pyruvate carboxylase (PC). The PC stimulatory effects of DEX were significant after 7, 14 and 21 days of treatment and could be readily observed after 24 hours. A dose response study indicated that the stimulatory effect was significant at a concentration of 10 - 9 M, but reaching a plateau at 10 - 8 M. With a biotin-free medium, it was demonstrated that biotin deficiency did not fully limit PC expression; however, the expression of <b>propionyl</b> <b>CoA</b> carboxylase was compromised. Glucose did not stimulate the expression of this enzyme as it was demonstrated in pancreatic islets. In the experiments, some PUFA were found to modulate the expression of PC in FRCC. The high PC expression found with DEX treatment might be associated with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. Therefore, PC could be a molecular target for studying glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. ^ The investigations in FRCC revealed that PUFA influenced biochemical and physiological functions and modulated transcription factors relevant to bone biology and health. This research advances the knowledge of dietary PUFA actions in bone metabolism and skeletal health. ...|$|E
40|$|In biotin-responsive {{multiple}} carboxylase deficiency, {{a characteristic}} organic aciduria reflects in vivo deficiency of mitochondrial <b>propionyl</b> <b>CoA</b> carboxylase, 3 -methylcrotonyl CoA carboxylase, and pyruvate carboxylase. A possible primary or secondary defect in biotin absorption {{leads to an}} infantile-onset syndrome, while abnormal holocarboxylase synthetase activity has been identified in the neonatal-onset form. While distinct mitochondrial and cytosolic holocarboxylase synthetase biotinylation systems may exist in avian tissues, the system has not been characterized in humans. Toward this objective, we studied the biotin dependence of a cytosolic carboxylase, acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC), in cultured skin fibroblasts of both types of multiple carboxylase deficiency. ACC specific activities in control and infantile-onset cells were not distinguishable at all biotin concentrations: with decreasing biotin availability (+ avidin), there were only modest decrements in ACC activity in both these cell types. In contrast, there were pronounced declines of ACC activity in neonatal-onset (holocarboxylase synthetase-deficient) cells after growth in low biotin concentrations, and activity was undetectable in + avidin. ACC activity was rapidly restored with biotin repletion to biotin-starved holocarboxylase synthetase-deficient cells, and this restoration was largely independent of protein synthesis. The behavior of the cytosolic carboxylase, ACC, is in all these respects identical {{to that of the}} mitochondrial carboxylases, an observation consistent with the existence of similar biotinylation mechanisms in the two cell compartments. Further, the data support the notion that at least some components of the holocarboxylase synthetase system are shared by mitochondria and cytosol in humans, and are consistent with the suggestion that restoration of activity in biotin-depleted cells represents biotinylation of preexisting enzyme protein. The modest decrements in ACC activity in normal and infantile-onset cells {{may be related to the}} compromised epidermal integrity observed in that form of multiple carboxylase deficiency. Finally, ACC and mitochondrial carboxylase activities were compared in cells from mutants representing a spectrum of clinical severity. Cells from later-onset patients of intermediate clinical severity were ultimately classifiable as putative holocarboxylase synthetase-deficient cells on chemical criteria. Accurate etiologic classification cannot be based on clinical presentation alone, and biochemical studies should be performed on all patients. Accordingly, we propose a classification of multiple carboxylase deficiency based on biochemical criteria...|$|E

Methods: MYO were incubated with control or CM for 6, 24 and 48 hrs. For the microarray experiments control and CAPAN- 1 CM MYO were used to obtain total RNA, extracted after 16 and 26 hrs: 15 g were labelled with Cy 3 and Cy 5 fluorochromes by direct incorporation (RT). Results: After 24 hrs lactate increased in all CM MYO [control MYO 0. 48 0. 07 mmol/L, mean increment SEM; CAPAN- 1 - CM 1. 10 0. 07 (t 6. 19, p 0. 001); PANC- 1 -CM 0. 8 0. 18 (t 4. 48, p 0. 01); MIAPaCa 2 -CM 1. 2 0. 13 (t 3. 97, p 0. 01); BXPC 3 -CM 1. 16 0. 13 (t 3. 16, p 0. 05) ]. HK 1, GSK 3 A, PYGM, PKM 2, ENO 3, ALDOA, GAPDH, PFKM, PDH, IDH 2, 3, 3 G, succinylCoA synthetase, SDHD and MDH 2 expression did not vary. The expression level at 16 or 26 hrs in comparison with baseline control MYO gave the following results: 23 genes were overexpressed, 8 exerting known biological functions: RPS 16, fibrillarin, APOBEC 2, BCL 2 -associated athanogene, ALY, PXR 1, PAFAH 1 B 1 and cathepsin G; 24 genes were downregulated, 9 exerting known biological functions: RPS 12, thymosin beta 10, troponin T 1, IGF 2 R, RPL 14, RPL 8, PET 112 -like, actin alpha and sorcin. The expression levels found in 16 or 26 hrs CM MYO, in comparison with that of 16 and 26 hrs control MYO, was as follow: a total of 43 genes were overexpressed in CM MYO (among which IDH 3 B, RPL 22, RPS 3 A, RPS 21, <b>propionyl</b> <b>CoA</b> carboxylase), and 22 were underexpressed (among which VAMP 5). Conclusions: One or more PC compound/s induces MYO production of lactate, through a mechanism independent from genes involved in glycolysis or glycogen synthesis. PC CM enhances the expression of proteolytic enzymes, as cathepsin G, and reduces the expression of ribosomal proteins, possibly favouring protein degradation with respect to synthesis, thus underlying cancer cachexia. A downregulation of the expression of IGF 2 R, which is associated with GLUT 4, and of VAMP 5 might interfere with glucose transport when MYO conditioning persists...|$|E
40|$|Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the {{etiological}} {{agent of}} tuberculosis, has adapted with the host environment and evolved {{to survive in}} harsh conditions in the host. The pathogen has successfully evolved strategies not only to evade the host immune system but also to thrive within the host cells. Upon infection, the pathogen is either cleared due to the host immune response, or it survives and causes active tuberculosis (TB) infection. In {{a number of cases}} however, the pathogen is neither killed nor does it actively proliferate, but it remains dormant in the host until the environment becomes favorable. This dormant state of pathogen is responsible for latent TB infection (LTBI). WHO reports indicated that as much as a third of the whole worldâs population is exposed to the pathogen, of which a significant proportion could be latently infected (WHO report, 2015). These individuals do not show symptoms of active TB infection and hence are difficult to detect. The latent TB infected (LTBI) individuals serve as a reservoir for the pathogen, which can lead to epidemics when the conditions change. Hence, it is necessary to understand the host -pathogen interactions during LTBI, as this might provide clues to developing new strategies to detect and curb a latent infection. 	Host-pathogen interactions are multifaceted, in which both species attempt to recognize and respond to each other, all of these through specific molecules making distinct interactions with the other species. The outcome of the infection is thus decided by a complex set of host-pathogen interactions. The complexity arises since a large number of molecular components are involved, also multiplicity of interactions among these components and due to several feedback, feed forwards or other regulatory or influential loops within the system. The complexity of biological systems makes modeling and simulation an essential and critical part of systemsâ level studies. Systems biology studies provide an integrated framework to analyze and understand the function of biological systems. This work addresses some of these issues with an unbiased systems-level analysis so as to identify and understand the important global changes both in the host and in the pathogen during LTBI. The broad objectives of the work was to identify the key processes that vary in the host during latent infection, the set of metabolic reactions in the host which can be modulated to control the reactivation of infection, global adaptation in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and then to utilize this knowledge to identify strategies for tackling latent infection. A review of literature of the current understanding of latency from the pathogen and the host perspective is described in chapter 1. From this, it is clear that most available studies have focused on the role of individual molecules and individual biological processes such as granuloma formation, toll-like receptor signaling, T cell responses as well as cytokine signaling, in either initiating or maintaining a latent infection, but there is no report till date about whether and how these processes are connected with each other. While transcriptome based studies have identified lists of differentially expressed genes in LTBI as compared to healthy controls, no further understanding is currently available for many of them, regarding the processes they may be involved in and what interactions they make, which may be important for understanding LTBI. The first part of the work is a systematic meta-analysis of genome-scale protein interaction networks rendered condition-specific with transcriptome data of patients with LTBI, which has provided a global unbiased picture of the transcriptional and metabolic variations in the host and in the pathogen during the latent infection. To start with, publicly available gene expression data related to LTBI, active TB and healthy controls were considered. In all, 183 datasets summing up to 105 LTBI, 41 active TB and 37 healthy control samples were analyzed. (Chapter 2). Standard analysis of the transcriptome profiles of these datasets indicated that there was zero overlap among them and that not a single gene was seen in common among all datasets for the same condition. An extensive human protein-protein interaction network was constructed using information available from multiple resources that comprehensively contained structural or physical interactions and genetic interactions or functional influences. Nodes in this network represented individual proteins and edges represented interactions between pairs of nodes. The identity of each node and the nature of interaction of each edge along with the type of evidence that was used as the basis for drawing the edge, was collated for the network. The gene expression data was integrated into the human protein-protein interaction (PPI) network for each condition, which essentially had weighted nodes and directed edges, specific to that condition, from which specific comparative networks were derived. The highest ranked perturbations in LTBI were identified through a network mining protocol previously established in the laboratory. This involved computing all versus all shortest paths on the comparative network, scoring the paths based on connectedness and various centrality measures of the nodes and the edges and finally ranking the paths based on the cumulative path scores. Intriguingly, the top-ranked set of perturbations were found to form a connected sub-network by themselves, referred to as a top perturbed sub-network (top-net), indicating that they were functionally linked or perhaps even orchestrated in some sense. Th 17 signaling appears to be dominant. About 40 genes were identified in the unique set of LTBI condition as compared to the active TB condition, and these genes showed enrichment for processes such as apoptosis, cell cycle as well as natural killer cell mediated toxicity. Construction and analysis of a miRNA network indicated that 32 of these have strong associations with miRNA explaining the role of the latter in controlling LTBI. 3 other genes from the top-net are already established drug targets for different diseases with known drugs associated with them, which are BCL 2, HSP 90 AA 1 and NR 3 C 1. These 3 proteins can be explored further as drug targets in LTBI whose manipulation using existing drugs may result in inhibiting the underlying biological process and thereby result in disturbing the state of latency. As a second objective, global variations in the host transcriptome were identified during ascorbic acid induced dormancy (Chapter 3). Ascorbic acid or Vitamin C is a nutrient supplement required in the diet. This organic compound has a known antioxidant property, as it is known to scavenge the free radicals. In a recent study, Taneja et al, demonstrated that Vitamin C could induce dormancy in Mtb. On similar lines, experiments were done in THP- 1 cells infected with Mtb to determine the host responses during ascorbic acid (AA) induced dormancy. The raw gene expression data was provided by our collaborator Prof. Jaya Tyagi that included 0 hour, 4 days and 6 days time points with infection and vitamin C versus infection alone or vitamin C alone as controls. The transcriptome data was normalized and integrated into the human PPI network as described for the meta-analyses. It was experimentally determined that ascorbic acid induces dormancy in 4 days post infection. The top-ranked paths of perturbation were analyzed and compared for three different conditions: (i) uninfected condition, (ii) AA treated and infected condition, and (iii) AA, isoniazid and infected condition. The dormant pathogen is known to be drug-tolerant and thus as a marker for the state of dormancy, the lack of effect of isoniazid is also monitored in the infected host cells. The analysis revealed that there were some broad similarities as compared to LTBI from patient samples but AA induced dormancy in cell lines stood out a separate group indicating that there were significant differences such as involving Interferon Induced Transmembrane Proteins (IFITMs), vacuolar ATPase as well as GDF 15, which belongs to TGF-beta signaling pathway. The highest ranked perturbed paths contained genes involved in innate immune responses of which ISG 15, IFITMs, HLAs and ATPases emerge as the most altered in the dormant condition. CCR 7 emerges as a key discriminator, which is subdued in the latent samples but highly induced in infection conditions. Pathway-based analysis of different conditions showed that oxidative stress, glutathione metabolism, proteasome degradation as well as type II interferon signaling are significantly up-regulated in AA induced dormancy. The dormant bacteria reside in the host cells and are known to modulate the host metabolism for their own benefit. So, the third objective was to understand the metabolic variations in the host during LTBI (Chapter 4). A genome-scale metabolic (GSM) model of alveolar macrophage was used in this study. The metabolic model contains information of the reactions, metabolites and the genes encoding enzymes that catalyze a particular reaction. Flux balance analysis (FBA), a constraint-based metabolic modeling method, is used for analyzing the alterations in the metabolism under different infection conditions. In order to mimic the physiological condition, gene expression data was used for constraining the bounds of the reactions in the model. Two different expression studies were used for analysis: GSE 25534 (from Chapter 2) and ascorbic acid induced dormancy (Chapter 3). The analysis was carried out for latent TB versus healthy control and latent TB versus active TB to identify the most altered metabolic processes in LTBI. Differences in fluxes between the two conditions were calculated. A new classification scheme was devised to categorize the reactions on the basis of flux differences. In this chapter, higher fluxes in LTBI condition were identified for reactions involved in transport of small metabolites as well as amino acids. Solute carrier proteins responsible for the transport of the metabolites were identified and their biological significance is discussed. Reduced glutathione (GSH), arachidonic acid, prostaglandins, pantothenate were identified as important metabolites in LTBI condition and their physiological role has been described. Sub-system analysis for different conditions shows differential regulation for arachidonic acid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, folate metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, glutathione metabolism, ROS detoxification, triacylglycerol synthesis and transport as well as tryptophan metabolism. From the study, transporter proteins and reactions altered during LTBI were identified, which again provide clues for understanding the molecular basis of establishing a latent infection. Mycoabcterium tuberculosis is known to undergo dormancy during stress conditions. In this chapter, the main objective was to identify the global variations in the dormant Mtb (Chapter 5). To carry out the analysis, the Mtb PPI network was constructed using information from available resources. Gene expression data of two different dormancy models, Wayne growth model and multiple-stress model, were used for the study. To identify the key players involved in reversal of dormancy, the transcriptome data of reaeration condition was also used. In this study, the Max-flow algorithm was implemented to identify the feasible paths or flows in different condition. The flows with higher scores indicate that more information is traversed by the path, and hence is important for the study. From the analysis of Wayne growth model (hypoxia model), important transcriptional regulators such as SigB, SigE, SigH, regulators in the two-component system such as MprA, MtrA, PhoP, RegX 3 and TrcR were identified in stress condition. Multiple-stress model studied the growth of bacteria in low oxygen concentration, high carbon dioxide levels, low pH and nutrient starvation. The gene expression data was integrated in the Mtb PPI network and implementation of Max-flow algorithm showed that MprA, part of the MprA-MprB two-component system, is involved in the regulation of persistent condition. WhiB 1 also features in the paths of dormant condition and its role in persistence can be explored. In reaeration model, WhiB 1 and WhiB 4 are present in the top flows of this condition indicating that the redox state is perturbed in the pathogen and the interactions of these proteins are important to understand the reversal of dormant condition. From the study, Rv 2034, Rv 2035, HigA, Rv 1989, Rv 1990 and Rv 0837 proteins belonging to toxin-antitoxin systems were also identified in the dormant bacteria, indicating their role in adaptation during stress condition. The role of Rv 2034 has been studied in persistence, but the function of other proteins can be analyzed to provide new testable hypotheses about the role of these proteins in dormancy. Thus, the flows or paths perturbed during dormancy were identified in this study. To get {{a better understanding of the}} metabolic network active in mycobacteria under different conditions, experiments were performed in Mycobacterium smegmatis MC 2 155. The non-pathogenic strain of genus Mycobacteria, Mycobacterium smegmatis, is used as a surrogate to carry out molecular biology studies of Mtb. Mycobacterium smegmatis MC 2 155 (Msm) is the commonly used laboratory strain for experimental purpose. In order to obtain a clear understanding of how comparable are the metabolic networks between the virulent M. tuberculosis H 37 Rv and the model system Msm, the latter model is first studied systematically. In Chapter 6, first the functional annotation of the Msm genome was carried out and the genes were categorized into different Tuberculist classes based on homology with the Mtb genome. A high-throughput growth characterization was carried out to characterize the strain systematically in terms of different carbon, nitrogen or other sources that promoted growth and thus served as nutrients and those that did not, together yielding a genome-phenome correlation in Msm. Gene expression was measured and used for explaining the observed phenotypic behavior of the organism. Together with the genome sequence, the transcriptome and phenome analysis, a set of about 257 different metabolic pathways were identified to be feasible in wild-type Msm. About 284 different carbon, nitrogen source and nutrient supplements were tested in this experiment and 167 of them supported growth of Msm. This indicates that the compounds enter the cells and are metabolized efficiently, thus yielding similar phenotypes. The expressed genes and metabolites supporting growth were mapped to the metabolic network of Msm, thus helping in the identification of feasible metabolic routes in Msm. A comparative study between Msm and Mtb revealed that these organisms share similarity in the nutrient sources that are utilized for growth. The study provides experimental proof to identify the feasible metabolic routes in Msm, and this can be used for understanding the metabolic capability in the two organisms under different conditions providing a basis to understand adaptations during dormancy. In the last part of the work presented in this thesis, the metabolic shift in the pathogen was studied using a genome-scale metabolic model of Mtb (Chapter 7). The model contains information of the reactions, metabolites and genes involved in the reactions. Flux balance analysis (FBA) was carried out by integrating normalized gene expression data (Wayne model and multiple-stress model transcriptome considered in Chapter 5) to identify the set of reactions, which have a higher flux in the dormant condition as compared to the control replicating condition. Glutamate metabolism along with <b>propionyl</b> <b>CoA</b> metabolism emerge as major up-regulated processes in dormant Mtb. Next, with an objective of identifying essential genes in dormant Mtb, a systematic in silico single gene knock-out analysis was carried out where each gene and it's associated reaction was knocked out of the model, one at a time and the ability of the model to reach its objective function assessed. About 168 common genes in Wayne model and multiple-stress model were identified as important in Mtb after the knockout analysis. Essentiality is in essence a systems property and requires to be probed through multiple angles. Towards this, essential genes were identified in Mtb using a multi-level multi-scale systems biology approach. About 283 genes were identified as essential on the basis of combined analysis of transcriptome data, FBA, network analysis and phyletic retention studies in Mtb. 168 genes identified as important in dormant Mtb were compared with 283 essential genes and about 91 genes were found to be essential. Finally, among the set of essential genes, those that satisfy other criteria for a drug target were analyzed using the list of high-confidence drug targets of Mtb available in the laboratory along with their associated drug or drug-like molecules. 38 out of the 168 important genes in Mtb were found to have one or more drugs associated with them from the DrugBank database. Colchicin-Rv 1655, Raloxifene-Rv 1653, Bexarotene-Rv 3804, Rosiglitazone-Rv 3804 are top-scoring drug-target pairs that can be explored for killing dormant bacilli. The study has thus been useful in identifying important proteins, reactions and drug targets in dormant Mtb. In summary, the thesis presents a comprehensive systems-level understanding of various aspects of host responses and pathogen adaptation during latent TB infection. Key host and pathogen factors involved in LTBI are identified that serve as useful pointers for deriving strategies for tackling a latent infection...|$|E
