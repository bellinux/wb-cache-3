25|$|Axial {{electrolytic}} capacitor styles have a bar across {{or around the}} case pointing to the negative lead end to indicate the negative terminal.

25|$|They are {{typically}} {{loaded into the}} hearing aid via a rotating battery door, with the flat side (case) as the <b>positive</b> <b>terminal</b> (cathode) and the rounded side as the negative terminal (anode).|$|E
25|$|Radial or {{single-ended}} {{electrolytic capacitor}} styles have a bar across {{the side of}} the capacitor to indicate the negative terminal side, and the negative terminal lead is shorter than the <b>positive</b> <b>terminal</b> lead.|$|E
50|$|In electronics, a {{high output}} {{would mean the}} output is {{sourcing}} current from the <b>positive</b> power <b>terminal</b> (<b>positive</b> voltage). A low output would mean the output is sinking current to the negative power terminal (zero voltage). High impedance {{would mean that the}} output is effectively disconnected from the circuit.|$|R
50|$|Niobium {{capacitors}} are {{in general}} polarized components, with distinctly marked <b>positive</b> <b>terminals.</b> When subjected to reversed polarity (even briefly), the capacitor depolarizes and the dielectric oxide layer breaks down, {{which can cause}} it to fail even when later operated with correct polarity. If the failure is a short circuit (the most common occurrence), and current {{is not limited to}} a safe value, catastrophic thermal runaway may occur.|$|R
50|$|Ground noise {{appears at}} the {{negative}} input of an amplifier for several reasons, including ground loop. Other causes can deliver a different input signal to the amplifier's negative input terminal and not also simultaneously to the amplifier's <b>positive</b> input <b>terminal.</b>|$|R
25|$|Anode: The {{electrode}} {{at which}} oxidation (a loss of electrons) takes place. For fuel cells and other galvanic cells, the anode is the negative terminal; for electrolytic cells (where electrolysis occurs), the anode is the <b>positive</b> <b>terminal.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{schematic}} diagrams, {{a capacitor}} used primarily for DC charge storage is often drawn vertically in circuit diagrams with the lower, more negative, plate drawn as an arc. The straight plate indicates the <b>positive</b> <b>terminal</b> of the device, {{if it is}} polarized (see electrolytic capacitor).|$|E
25|$|The simple {{half-wave}} rectifier {{can be built}} in two electrical configurations with the diodes pointing in opposite directions, one version connects the negative terminal of the output direct to the AC supply and the other connects the <b>positive</b> <b>terminal</b> of the output direct to the AC supply. By combining both of these with separate output smoothing {{it is possible to}} get an output voltage of nearly double the peak AC input voltage. This also provides a tap in the middle, which allows use of such a circuit as a split rail power supply.|$|E

50|$|The first {{starting}} and charging systems {{were designed to}} be 6-volt and positive-ground systems, with the vehicle's chassis directly connected to the <b>positive</b> battery <b>terminal.</b> Today, all road vehicles have a negative ground system. The negative battery terminal {{is connected to the}} car's chassis.|$|R
500|$|The {{required}} {{direction of}} current depended on {{the direction in which}} electric current was thought to flow in nerves in the human or animal body. [...] For motor functions, for instance, the flow was taken to be from the centre towards the muscles at the extremities, so artificial electrical stimulation needed {{to be in the same}} direction. [...] For sensory nerves, the opposite applied: flow was from the extremity to the centre, and the positive electrode would be applied to the extremity. [...] This principle was demonstrated by Bird in an experiment with a living frog. [...] A supply of frogs was usually on hand, as they were used in the frog galvanoscope. [...] The electromagnetic galvanometer was available at the time, but frogs' legs were still used by Bird because of their much greater sensitivity to small currents. [...] In the experiment, the frog's leg was almost completely severed from its body, leaving only the sciatic nerve connected, and electric current was then applied from the body to the leg. [...] Convulsions of the leg were seen when the muscle was stimulated. [...] Reversing the current, however, produced no movement of the muscle, merely croaks of pain from the frog. [...] In his lectures, Bird describes many experiments with a similar aim on human sensory organs. [...] In one experiment by Grapengiesser, for instance, electric current is passed through the subject's head from ear to ear, causing a sound to be hallucinated. [...] The ear connected to the <b>positive</b> <b>terminal</b> hears a louder sound than that connected to the negative.|$|E
2500|$|When {{describing}} AAA, AA, C, sub-C and D size cells, {{the negative}} electrode {{is connected to}} the flat end, and the <b>positive</b> <b>terminal</b> is the end with the raised button. [...] This is usually reversed in button cells, with the flat ended cylindrical can being the <b>positive</b> <b>terminal.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Tantalum {{electrolytic}} capacitors with solid electrolyte are marked at their <b>positive</b> <b>terminal</b> with a bar or a [...] "+". Tantalum {{electrolytic capacitors}} with non-solid electrolyte (axial leaded style) are {{marked on the}} negative terminal with a bar or a “-“ (minus). The polarity better can be identified on the shaped side of the case, which has the <b>positive</b> <b>terminal.</b> The different marking styles can cause dangerous confusion.|$|E
5000|$|The rear {{sound level}} in a live {{performance}} recorded in stereo is reproduced about 7 dB below the front level, but clearly audible. The rear ambient sounds, applause, and coughs from the audience are sometimes received out of phase by the stereo microphones, while sounds from the musicians mostly are in [...] "synchronous phase".Thus, if rear speakers are fed with {{the difference between the}} stereo channels, audience noises and reverberation from the auditorium may be heard from behind the listener. This can be most easily achieved by wiring two similar additional rear speakers in series between the live feeds (<b>positive</b> <b>terminals)</b> from the stereo amplifier. Alternatively, one rear speaker can be used on its own. This is the type of quad setup used by Seeburg jukeboxes that had quadraphonic sound.|$|R

2500|$|This {{concept is}} called grid bias. Many early radio sets had a third battery called the [...] "C battery" [...] (unrelated to the present-day C cell, {{for which the}} letter denotes its size and shape). The C cell's <b>positive</b> <b>terminal</b> was {{connected}} to the cathode of the tubes (or [...] "ground" [...] in most circuits) and whose negative terminal supplied this bias voltage to the grids of the tubes.|$|E
2500|$|Inside {{a source}} of emf that is open-circuited, the {{conservative}} electrostatic field created by separation of charge exactly cancels the forces producing the emf. Thus, [...] the emf has the same value but opposite sign as the integral of the electric field aligned with an internal path between two terminals A and B of {{a source of}} emf in open-circuit condition (the path is taken from the negative terminal to the <b>positive</b> <b>terminal</b> to yield a positive emf, indicating work done on the electrons moving in the circuit).|$|E
2500|$|An {{electric}} battery is a device consisting {{of one or}} more electrochemical cells with external connections provided to power electrical devices [...] such as flashlights, smartphones, and electric cars. When a battery is supplying electric power, its <b>positive</b> <b>terminal</b> is the cathode and its negative terminal is the anode. The terminal marked negative is the source of electrons that when connected to an external circuit will flow and deliver energy to an external device. When a battery is connected to an external circuit, electrolytes are able to move as ions within, allowing the chemical reactions to be completed at the separate terminals and so deliver energy to the external circuit. It is the movement of those ions within the battery which allows current to flow out of the battery to perform work. Historically the term [...] "battery" [...] specifically referred to a device composed of multiple cells, however the usage has evolved additionally to include devices composed of a single cell.|$|E
5000|$|To {{comply with}} the convention, the {{direction}} of the voltage and current variables used to calculate power and resistance in the component must have a certain relationship: the current variable must be defined so positive current enters the <b>positive</b> voltage <b>terminal</b> of the device. [...] These directions may be different from the directions of the actual current flow and voltage.|$|R

5000|$|Icebreaker's albums {{have met}} with a very <b>positive</b> response. <b>Terminal</b> Velocity was {{described}} by Joshua Kosman in the San Francisco Chronicle as an [...] "electrifying new disc ... superb" [...] and it was described by the American Record Guide as [...] "a stimulating, well-filled disc". [...] Trance was also well-received, particularly in its remastered version: the BBC Music Magazine referred to its [...] "furious precision", whilst Gramophone described parts of it as [...] "genuinely mesmeric".|$|R
2500|$|Photomultiplier tubes {{typically}} utilize 1000 to 2000 volts {{to accelerate}} electrons within {{the chain of}} dynodes. (See Figure near top of article.) The most negative voltage {{is connected to the}} cathode, and the most positive voltage is connected to the anode. Negative high-voltage supplies (with the <b>positive</b> <b>terminal</b> grounded) are often preferred, because this configuration enables the photocurrent to be measured at the low voltage side of the circuit for amplification by subsequent electronic circuits operating at low voltage. However, with the photocathode at high voltage, leakage currents sometimes result in unwanted [...] "dark current" [...] pulses that may affect the operation. [...] Voltages are distributed to the dynodes by a resistive voltage divider, although variations such as active designs (with transistors or diodes) are possible. The divider design, which influences frequency response or rise time, can be selected to suit varying applications. Some instruments that use photomultipliers have provisions to vary the anode voltage to control the gain of the system.|$|E
50|$|All {{electric}} {{cells have}} two terminals. The {{first is the}} <b>positive</b> <b>terminal</b> {{and the second is}} the negative terminal. The <b>positive</b> <b>terminal</b> looks like a metal cap and the negative terminal looks like a metal disc. The current flows from the <b>positive</b> <b>terminal,</b> and out through the negative terminal, replicative of current flow (positive (+) to negative (-) flow).|$|E
50|$|Axial {{electrolytic}} capacitor styles have a bar across {{or around the}} case pointing to the negative lead end to indicate the negative terminal. The <b>positive</b> <b>terminal</b> of the capacitor {{is on the side}} of the sealing. The negative terminal lead is shorter than the <b>positive</b> <b>terminal</b> lead.|$|E
50|$|An {{envelope}} detector is an electronic circuit {{that takes a}} high-frequency signal as input and provides an output which is the envelope of the original signal. The capacitor in the circuit stores up charge on the rising edge, and releases it slowly through the resistor when the signal falls. The diode in series rectifies the incoming signal, allowing current flow only when the <b>positive</b> input <b>terminal</b> is at a higher potential than the negative input terminal.|$|R
50|$|Electrical {{polarity}} (positive and negative) is {{the direction}} of current flow in an electrical circuit. Current flows from the <b>positive</b> pole (<b>terminal)</b> to the negative pole. Electrons flow from negative to positive. In a direct current (DC) circuit, current flows in one direction only, and one pole is always negative and the other pole is always positive. In an alternating current (AC) circuit the two poles alternate between negative and positive and {{the direction of}} the current (electron flow) reverses periodically.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a source}} or active component, {{such as a}} battery or {{electric}} generator, current is forced {{to move through the}} device in the direction of greater electric potential, from the negative to the <b>positive</b> voltage <b>terminal.</b> This increases the potential energy of the electric charges, so electric power flows out of the component into the circuit. Work must be done on the moving charges by some source of energy in the component, to make them move in this direction against the opposing force of the electric field E.|$|R
50|$|When {{describing}} AAA, AA, C, sub-C and D size cells, {{the negative}} electrode {{is connected to}} the flat end, and the <b>positive</b> <b>terminal</b> is the end with the raised button.

40|$|Background: Previous work by our lab {{and others}} has implicated {{glutamate}} {{as a major}} excitatory signal to gonadotropin hormone releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons, with gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) serving as a potential major inhibitory signal. However, it is unknown whether GABAergic and/or glutamatergic synaptic appositions to GnRH neurons changes {{on the day of}} the proestrous LH surge or is affected by aging. Methodology/Principal Findings: To examine this question, synaptic terminal appositions on GnRH neurons for VGAT (vesicular GABA transporter) and VGLUT 2 (vesicular glutamate transporter- 2), markers of GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic terminals, respectively, was examined by immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopic analysis in young and middle-aged diestrous and proestrous rats. The results show that in young proestrous rats at the time of LH surge, we observed reciprocal changes in the VGAT and VGLUT 2 <b>positive</b> <b>terminals</b> apposing GnRH neurons, where VGAT terminal appositions were decreased and VGLUT 2 terminal appositions were significantly increased, as compared to young diestrus control animals. Interestingly, in middle-aged cycling animals this divergent modulation of VGAT and VGLUT 2 terminal apposition was greatly impaired, as no significant differences were observed between VGAT and VGLUT 2 terminals apposing GnRH neurons at proestrous. However, the density of VGAT and VGLUT 2 terminals apposing GnRH neurons were both significantly increased in the middle-aged animals...|$|R
50|$|A {{common type}} of short circuit occurs when the <b>positive</b> and {{negative}} <b>terminals</b> of a battery are connected with a low-resistance conductor, like a wire.
