Between <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>child</b> in the womb exists a reciprocal relationship at a physiological (hormonal), psychological and spiritual level.

25|$|The {{government}} of independent Ukraine implemented policies {{to broaden the}} use of Ukrainian and mandated a progressively increased role for Ukrainian {{in the media and}} commerce. The most significant was the government's concerted effort to implement Ukrainian, as the only official state language in the country, into the state educational system. Despite the Constitution, the Law on Education (grants Ukrainian families (<b>parents</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>children)</b> a right to choose their native language for schools and studies) as well as the Law of Languages (a guarantee for the protection of all languages in Ukraine) the education system gradually reshaped from a system that was only partly Ukrainian to the one that is overwhelmingly so. The Russian language is still studied as a required course in all secondary schools, including those with Ukrainian as the primary language of instructions. The number of secondary school students who received their primary education in Ukrainian has grown from 47.9% in 1990-1991. (the last school year before the Ukrainian independence) to 67.4% in 1999 and to 75.1% by 2003-2004 (see table). The Ukrainization has achieved even greater gains in the higher education institutions where as of 1990-1991 only 7% of students were being taught primarily in Ukrainian. By 2003-2004 the percentage of the college and technicum students studying in Ukrainian reached 87.7% and for the students of the University-level institutions this number reached 80.1% (see table).|$|E
