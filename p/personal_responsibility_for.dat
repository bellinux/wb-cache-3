5|$|The main themes {{expressed}} in the collection include how an individual's worldview (Weltanschauung) affects their actions and the attitudes of those around them, the philosophy of social determinism, and why a lack of <b>personal</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> one's actions results from an individual's beliefs in determinism. The writing style that Dalrymple explains these in was praised by reviewers for its clear, witty prose and for going immediately to the truth and heart of any matter that is being discussed.|$|E
5|$|On October 6, 1973, an Arab {{coalition}} led by Egypt and Syria, supported {{with arms}} and materiel by the Soviet Union, attacked Israel in the Yom Kippur War. Israel suffered heavy losses and Nixon ordered an airlift to resupply Israeli losses, cutting through inter-departmental squabbles and bureaucracy and taking <b>personal</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> any response by Arab nations. More {{than a week}} later, {{by the time the}} U.S. and Soviet Union began negotiating a truce, Israel had penetrated deep into enemy territory. The truce negotiations rapidly escalated into a superpower crisis; when Israel gained the upper hand, Egyptian President Sadat requested a joint U.S.-USSR peacekeeping mission, which the U.S. refused. When Soviet Premier Brezhnev threatened to unilaterally enforce any peacekeeping mission militarily, Nixon ordered the U.S. military to DEFCON3, placing all U.S. military personnel and bases on alert for nuclear war. This was the closest that the world had come to nuclear war since the Cuban Missile Crisis. Brezhnev backed down as a result of Nixon's actions.|$|E

30|$|The polytechnic {{curriculum}} in Uganda aims at training {{students to become}} engineering technicians, with necessary competency to exercise technical judgment and assume <b>personal</b> <b>responsibilities</b> <b>for</b> duties in the engineering technical field (Eluk 1994). The engineering technician is required {{to be able to}} understand the reasons and purposes of the operations for which s/he is responsible perform highly technical duties of an established or novel character and to carry out technical and managerial responsibility either independently or under the direction of qualified engineers and scientists. Besides, an engineering technician must have the personal ability of leadership and logical thinking (Hemlin et al. 2014; Khairullina et al. 2016). Mathematics at the polytechnic in Uganda is mainly taught through lectures, demonstrations, and project works. The content meant to be covered in 156  h encompasses number systems, algebra and matrices, trigonometric functions, hyperbolic functions, calculus, vectors, McLaurin theorem, ordinary and partial differential equations, harmonic analysis, Laplace transforms, and statistics (Stroud and Booth 2013).|$|R

But {{in the postwar}} {{political}} climate it was imperative to fulfill the Soviet demands {{in order not to}} give them any excuses to intervene even more in Finnish affairs. Oesch was condemned to twelve years of penal servitude by a Finnish military court on 19 July 1946, although the sentence was commuted to three years by the highest court on 2 February 1948. Nevertheless, Oesch’s military career was finished. Oesch was the only senior Finn to be convicted of war crimes.|$|E
25|$|Like Ausonius {{and later}} Sidonius Apollinaris, Marcellus {{is among those}} aristocratic Gauls of the 4th and 5th centuries who were {{nominally}} or even devoutly Christian but who fashioned themselves after the Republican ideal of the Roman noble: a career in politics balanced with country villas and informational or literary writing {{on a range of}} subjects, including philosophy, astronomy, agriculture, and the natural sciences.

25|$|Repin was {{the first}} Russian artist to achieve European fame using {{specifically}} Russian themes. His 1873 painting Barge Haulers on the Volga, radically different from previous Russian paintings, made him {{the leader of a}} new movement of critical realism in Russian art. He chose nature and character over academic formalism. The triumph of this work was widespread, and it was praised by contemporaries like Vladimir Stasov and Fyodor Dostoyevsky. The paintings show his feeling of <b>personal</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> the hard life of the common people and the destiny of Russia. In the 1880s he produced many of his most famous works, and joined the Itinerants' Society.|$|E
25|$|In {{psychological}} {{research on}} altruism, studies often observe altruism as demonstrated through prosocial {{behaviors such as}} helping, comforting, sharing, cooperation, philanthropy, and community service. Research has found that people {{are most likely to}} help if they recognize that a person is in need and feel <b>personal</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> reducing the person's distress. Research also suggests that the number of bystanders witnessing distress or suffering affects the likelihood of helping (the Bystander effect). Greater numbers of bystanders decrease individual feelings of responsibility. However, a witness {{with a high level of}} empathic concern is likely to assume personal responsibility entirely regardless of the number of bystanders. A feeling of personal responsibility or - moral norm - has also strongly been associated with other pro-social behaviors such as charitable giving.|$|E

40|$|The growing cost of {{the health}} care systems in Western {{countries}} and the need for reform of those systems has once again sparked a political debate about how to distribute health fairly. The current trend is to put more emphasis on <b>personal</b> <b>responsibility</b> {{when it comes to the}} subject of health. This thesis examines different normative theories on how to distribute health fairly. The question is raised of whether there should be put more emphasis on the <b>personal</b> <b>responsibility</b> people have <b>for</b> their health in a fair distribution of health. The conclusion of this thesis is that <b>personal</b> <b>responsibility</b> should not play a role when it comes to a just distribution of health. The punishment for making a wrong decision is too high when making <b>personal</b> <b>responsibility</b> the main criterion for the distribution of health...|$|R
25|$|In October 2001, Poundstone {{was charged}} with felony child endangerment in {{connection}} with driving while intoxicated with children in the car. She was also charged with three counts of lewd acts upon a girl younger than 14. She changed her earlier plea of not guilty, and, in exchange, prosecutors dropped three counts of committing lewd acts against a child and added a misdemeanor count of inflicting injury upon a child. Poundstone also pleaded no contest to one count of felony child endangerment. She was sentenced to probation, six months in rehabilitation, and ordered to perform 200 hours of community service. In 2002, Poundstone talked about her <b>personal</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> the {{events that led to}} her arrest and the steps she has taken, including a six-month treatment program for alcoholism, but said that she did not commit any lewd acts or child abuse.|$|E
25|$|Regarding {{locus of}} control, {{there is another}} type of control that entails a mix among the {{internal}} and external types. People that have the combination of the two types of locus of control are often referred to as Bi-locals. People that have Bi-local characteristics are known to handle stress and cope with their diseases more efficiently by having the mixture of internal and external locus of control. People that have this mix of loci of control can take <b>personal</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> their actions and the consequences thereof while remaining capable of relying upon and having faith in outside resources; these characteristics correspond to {{the internal and external}} loci of control, respectively. An example of this mixed system would be an alcoholic who will accept the fact that he brought the disease upon himself while remaining open to treatment and/or acknowledging that there are people, mainly doctors and therapists, that are trying to cure his/her addiction, and on whom he should rely.|$|E

In the last four regional elections, the regional leaders of the PSD have been removed by its membership, following their defeats in the regional elections. Speaking following the victory of the PS, Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho recognized that the national context, and in particular the austerity measures had interfered in the results (even as he praised the work by the regional deputies and parties). During the campaign Artur Lima counseled the national leader, Paulo Portas, to abandon the coalition with the PSD, while Berta Cabral announced that she would order a vote against the state budget by PSD deputies from the Azores, if the budget confirmed an increase in the IRS or IMI. Passos Coelho was the only national leader of the major parties who did not participate in the campaign, while Paulo Portas limited his interventions to a few hours in Terceira, during a CDS commission-dinner, where he did not talk of national politics and evaded journalists questions.|$|E
50|$|Attribution {{theory is}} the theory {{concerning}} how people explain individual occurrences of causation.

Taking causation one step further, the type of attribution a person provides influences their future behavior.|$|R
