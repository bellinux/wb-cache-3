5|$|Sercey's {{campaign}} had ended in failure, with little disruption to British trade or naval {{operations in the}} East Indies. The East India Company had however taken more serious losses from the depredations of privateers. Most active was Robert Surcouf, whose small ship Emilie captured the timber ship Penguin off Pegu in October 1795 and country ships Russell, Sambolasse and Diana off {{the mouth of the}} Hooghly River in January 1796. More seriously, he also captured the <b>pilot</b> <b>boat</b> Cartier, which he used to seize the large East Indiaman Triton.|$|E

In a storm that followed the accident, a life raft containing bodies was blown along the coast to Lyme Regis. In helping to deal with the crisis, the local pub in Lyme Regis, called the <b>Pilot</b> <b>Boat,</b> offered its cellar as a mortuary.|$|E

25|$|At 1745 another <b>pilot</b> <b>boat,</b> the Preve, {{approached}} Teti and signalled {{her back}} to within {{the shelter of the}} mole. There the two boats came alongside each other and exchanged crews. Captain Tanlongo and his crew of two pilots, a helmsman and an engineer from Preve took over Teti and took her back out to sea.|$|E
25|$|Vigilance {{operated}} as <b>pilot</b> <b>boat</b> at the Yokkaichi anchorage, anchoring nightly in the Matoya Ko, rendezvousing with vessels off {{the harbor}} and leading them through the minefields to port.

Reassigned duties as pilot ship soon thereafter, Vigilance returned to Iseno Umi and Matoya Ko on 31 October.|$|E
25|$|Second Officer MacIsaac took {{command of}} the after part of the ship. He got a covered {{inflatable}} life raft launched and ordered Third Officer Meurig Caffery and two other men into it.

25|$|On 16 March 1594, Langton sighted {{the port}} of Puerto Caballos and entered its bay, seeing a number of ships in the harbour. With his ﬂagship Anthony flying false colors, Langton seized the harbor <b>pilot</b> <b>boat</b> and then demanded the {{surrender}} of the seven large ships awaiting cargo inside under Diego Ramírez. The demand was immediately refused {{but it did not}} stop Langton and so the next morning he engaged in a day-long gunnery duel with the Spanish, causing damage to both the town and ships.|$|E
25|$|The ship's {{arrival in}} New York {{led to a}} frenzy of press interest, with {{newspapers}} competing {{to be the first}} to report the survivors' stories. Some reporters bribed their way aboard the <b>pilot</b> <b>boat</b> New York, which guided Carpathia into harbour, and one even managed to get onto Carpathia before she docked. Crowds gathered outside newspaper offices to see the latest reports being posted in the windows or on billboards. It took another four days for a complete list of casualties to be compiled and released, adding to the agony of relatives waiting for news of those who had been aboard Titanic.|$|E
25|$|At 5:50am on {{the morning}} of 29 December 1929, the Lord Southborough was {{launched}} from her station in a south westerly gale in very heavy seas following reports of flares sighted close to Margate. The source of the flares was a German motorvessel called the Hermine of Wilhelmshaven. The vessel had run aground in the storm. The crew of the lifeboat boarded the vessel to help the Hermine but were unable to re-float her. The crew of the Hermine were eventually taken to shore aboard a <b>pilot</b> <b>boat.</b> For their part in the rescue the lifeboatmen were awarded certificates by the German government for their assistance in helping the crew of the Hermine.|$|E

25|$|Fogg {{discovers that}} {{he missed his}} connection. He {{searches}} for a vessel that will take him to Yokohama, finding a <b>pilot</b> <b>boat,</b> the Tankadere, that takes him and Aouda to Shanghai, where they catch a steamer to Yokohama. In Yokohama, they search for Passepartout, believing {{that he may have}} arrived there on the Carnatic as originally planned. They find him in a circus, trying to earn the fare for his homeward journey. Reunited, the four board a paddle-steamer, the General Grant, taking them across the Pacific to San Francisco. Fix promises Passepartout that now, having left British soil, he will no longer try to delay Fogg's journey, but instead support him in getting back to Britain so he can arrest Fogg in Britain itself.|$|E
25|$|The {{privateer}} Robert Surcouf had had {{a successful}} cruise in the Indian Ocean capturing several vessels, including the <b>pilot</b> <b>boat</b> Cartier, which he renamed Hasard. He transferred his remaining men from his ship Émilie to Hasard and on 28 January, sighting Triton at anchor, decided to attack. He recognised only too late the overwhelming superiority of his opponent. Surcouf, feeling unable to flee, decided to board her with his 26 men, After haranguing his men, he approached under a British flag, before hoisting French colours {{at the very last}} moment and launching a violent assault. In the ensuing 45-minute battle, Triton suffered 5 wounded and 10 killed, including Burnyeat and the first officer, Picket; Surcouf transferred his prisoners to Diana, another vessel that he had captured, and which he released to her captain against a 30,000 rupee ransom.|$|E
25|$|In 1913, {{all of the}} Cardiff {{pilots were}} amalgamated into a new company, the Steam <b>Pilot</b> <b>Boat</b> Company (Cardiff and Bristol Channel) Limited. The company, {{licensed}} to operate all pilots in the Bristol Channel, had commissioned a series of new steam powered pilot boats which were {{to be worked out}} of Barry Docks. However, the new company did not as part of the arrangement buy the then in-service sail cutters, which remained owned by their captains. This started the process of many being sold into service as private yachts. The process of amalgamation was stopped during World War I, but due to their design and speed, the last pilot cutters only retired in the early 1920s once the new steam and diesel technology had overtaken them in speed and efficiency. Cariad was the last sail-powered pilot cutter to retire in 1922.|$|E
50|$|In July 1809 the Royal Navy hired 10 open boats, all between 14 and 16 tons (bm), {{for less}} than a month to serve as <b>pilot</b> <b>boats</b> for the unfortunate Walcheren Campaign. One of these boats was named Ranger.|$|R

25|$|On 20 December 1960, Bon Jour {{departed}} Copenhagen {{bound for}} Stockholm, Sweden. During the voyage, {{some of the}} mast stays worked loose and the ship was anchored off Gotska Sandön whilst the mast was made secure. On 23 December, Bon Jour ran into a storm. The fishing vessel Danette located her {{the next day and}} on 25 December the crew abandoned Bon Jour as they feared the mast would collapse. They were taken to Sandhamn by <b>pilot</b> <b>boat.</b> On 26 December, the salvage tug Neptune took the crew back to Bon Jour. The next day, Neptune towed Bon Jour to Sandhamn. It was suggested that the ship should be taken to Lidingö for repairs, but on arrival there it was discovered that the shipyard had closed six months previously. Repairs were carried out by the Crichton-Vulcan shipyard, Turku, Finland. The work had to be done offshore as the Finnish Government applied pressure on Crichton-Vulcan not to fulfil the job.|$|E
25|$|The {{next day}} Creole {{attacked}} Esther. Creole, of Barracoa, was armed with {{six or seven}} guns of various calibers and had a crew of 111 men {{under the command of}} Captain Pierre Burgman. The two vessels exchanged fire for about an hour and then the privateers, taking advantage of the lack of wind, used their sweeps to come alongside. The fight continued for another 45 minutes, before the privateers could board. The fight then continued for another 20 minutes. Esthers officers and crew resisted until Irving was wounded and retired to his cabin, telling his third mate to strike. The privateers killed Irving in his cabin and proceeded to massacre a number of the other crewmen. A <b>pilot</b> <b>boat</b> from Charleston came out and took off the survivors. Two died on the boat, Mr. Ashton,the first mate, died on the wharf, and two more men died in the hospital. Two seamen at the hospital and 13 others were so terribly cut up that most were not expected to survive. Three of Esthers crew, a Venetian and two Portuguese, joined the privateer, though they had fought well during the action. Creole lost six killed, seven wounded, and had several men missing, believed to have been knocked overboard and drowned.|$|E
