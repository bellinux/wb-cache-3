50|$|While on {{the phone}} with the caller, Stu {{secretly}} uses his cell phone to call Kelly, allowing her to overhear his conversation with the caller. She, in turn, quietly informs Captain Ramey of this. Meanwhile, Stu continues to confess to everyone that his whole life is a lie, to make himself look more important than he really is or even feels. Stu's confession provides sufficient distraction to allow the police to trace the <b>payphone</b> <b>call</b> to a nearby building, and Ramey uses coded messages to inform Stu of this. Stu warns the caller that the police are on the way, and the caller replies that if he is caught, then he will kill Kelly. Panicked, Stu grabs the handgun and leaves the booth, screaming for the sniper to kill him instead of Kelly. The police fire upon Stu, while a smaller force breaks into the room that the caller was tracked to, only to find the gun and a man's corpse.|$|E
50|$|Some large {{telephone}} companies have toll-free numbers {{set up for}} ringback. In most cases, these numbers remain undisclosed to prevent abuse.

5000|$|Some {{carriers}} {{have been}} known to disable <b>payphone</b> <b>calls</b> to 958 or 959 test lines, such as Bell Canada's system-wide ANAC line at (area code) 958-2580. Conversely, a standard line on which voice service has been unsubscribed (such as an ADSL dry loop) may still accept calls to the 958 test exchange but not allow calls to standard numbers. This [...] "soft disconnect" [...] condition is intended to allow calls to 9-1-1 emergency services and to the telco business office to order telephone service, but to no other numbers.|$|R

5000|$|BT also {{introduced}} {{a new type of}} phonecard telephone to be used in their phonecard-operated kiosks in 1996, the BT Payphone 2000, which was installed in high usage sites such as airports and railway stations. This payphone featured a large LCD display with information to assist the user. The on-screen language could be also changed between English, Welsh, French, Italian and Spanish languages to help users whose first language is not English. They also launched a series of internet <b>payphones</b> <b>called</b> the Multi.phone, also known as the Multiphone, in 1999. The touch screen terminals display a range of [...] "hot buttons relevant {{to the needs of the}} modern traveller and consumer", with one of the buttons leading to BBC News Online. By January 2001, 600 Multi.phones were installed, but to revive the fortunes of their extensive network after usage fell 37% in two years, BT announced a six-month promotion during which the phones would be totally free for internet use. A BBC critic reviewed the Multi.phone in a negative light, saying it made the reviewer [...] "nostalgic for the old callbox pips. Sometimes, as BT once put it so perfectly, [...] "it's good to TALK"." [...] After the six month free trail was over, keyboards were added to the Multi.phones.|$|R

50|$|Besides being {{illegal for}} several reasons, {{access to the}} lines on payphones is usually limited by conduit or armor, but only for the first few, usually six to ten, feet. Payphones {{modified}} with discrete jumper wires for diodes to be clipped on were very popular in the early 1970s. Contrary to the green box, the diode allowed control from the <b>calling</b> <b>payphone.</b> A modified phone with a poor quality diode could be quickly identified by the constant clicking sound produced by the coin return mechanism. The single payphone at Canadian Village (also known as Lake Shore) located {{on the road to}} the marina of Huntington Lake in California was well known for this issue. Children would gather in the area to collect coins after a caller left, often to buy candy at the store across the road. Operation required using actual coins and lengthy long distance calls with mid-call Collect signals required deft manipulation of the noisy coins falling to the return, usually by covering the microphone with the hand or simply turning ones back to the phone.|$|R
5000|$|Upon {{returning}} to their compound, which has been overtaken by the terrorists, the Dude, Uncle Dave and the rest covertly sneak into the compound's underground bunker, where Richie reveals that he must now fulfill the prophecy foretold in Uncle Dave's fictional Bible: {{to bring about the}} extinction of the human race. As per Uncle Dave's Bible, the event initiating the apocalypse is the rape of a [...] "tiny entertainer" [...] by a thousand monkeys. After Verne Troyer is quickly thrown into a pit of chimpanzees, Richie shoots and kills Uncle Dave, then imprisons the Dude. The Dude manages to escape the compound with a plethora of weapons, deciding to wage a one-man war against al-Qaeda, his uncle's murderer, his cheating wife, the police and the many people who want him dead. On the way to his trailer (where he plans to blow up his spouse), he meets up with an attractive young barista, Faith, who joins forces with him after an explosive gunfight followed later by the Dude's heartfelt but futile monologue about war. The two of them then proceed to kill all the terrorists, all the bloodthirsty townspeople, the remains of the now-mad cult, his wife, and her multiple lovers. In the midst of the shootout, bin Laden is wounded but escapes to a <b>payphone,</b> where he <b>calls</b> Bush for help. Bush sends a helicopter to save him and plans for the two to rendezvous.|$|R
50|$|The video {{begins with}} a flashforward that starts with a beleaguered Levine {{torching}} his ride and dialing a telephone number at a payphone. Another typical day at a Las Vegas (seen from the decals on the police cars) bank for Levine is shown next, which turns into chaos when some bandits enter and take charge (some of the bank robbers are played by {{the other members of}} the band: guitarist James Valentine, drummer Matt Flynn, bassist Mickey Madden and keyboardist, previously a touring Maroon 5 member, PJ Morton) - all of this happens while the song plays in the background. Levine grabs a gun from one of the robbers and threatens to get rid of them. He and his female co-worker (played by Dutch model Bregje Heinen) escape, though Levine is shot in the arm, but when some cops mistake him for one of the robbers, Levine tells the female co-worker to hide in a car and steals an AC Cobra 427 that belongs to Wiz Khalifa to get away from them. A car chase follows and when Levine is almost caught by the police, he steers the stolen convertible onto the wrong side of the road and causes a huge explosion, which destroys one of the police cars. When he finally reaches his destination in Los Angeles, he passes by a place where Wiz Khalifa, the owner of the car, performed his rap earlier. After Levine gets out of the convertible, it also explodes and he enters a booth, injured, with the titular <b>payphone,</b> probably to <b>call</b> for help (it is also likely that he is calling his female co-worker) - this connects to the beginning of the video.|$|R
