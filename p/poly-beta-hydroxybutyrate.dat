50|$|The Burkholderia (previously part of Pseudomonas) genus name {{refers to}} a group of {{virtually}} ubiquitous Gram-negative, obligately aerobic, rod-shaped bacteria that are motile by means of single or multiple polar flagella, with the exception of Burkholderia mallei which is nonmotile. Members belonging to the genus do not produce sheaths or prosthecae and are able to utilize <b>poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate</b> (PHB) for growth. The genus includes both animal and plant pathogens, as well as some environmentally important species. In particular, B. xenovorans (previously named Pseudomonas cepacia then B. cepacia and B. fungorum) is renowned for being catalase positive (affecting patients with chronic granulomatous disease) and its ability to degrade chlororganic pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The conserved RNA structure Anti-hemB RNA motif is found in all known bacteria in this genus.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} competence-inducing {{treatments}} on {{the composition and}} organization of membrane lipids in Escherichia coli K- 12, DH 1, DH 5, HB 101, and RR 1 were investigated for two widely used protocols in which transformability is developed at low temperatures in Ca 2 + buffers. At stages during each procedure, the lipid compositions of the cells were determined, and the thermotropic lipid phase transitions were observed in whole cell culture by fluorescence assay with the hydrophobic probe N-phenyl- 1 -naphthylamine. Competence was evaluated by determining transformation efficiencies with plasmid pBR 322 DNA. The competence-inducing procedures effected only slight changes in phospholipid compositions which did not correlate with transformability. However, the induction of competence was coincident with de novo synthesis and incorporation of <b>poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate</b> into the cytoplasmic membranes and {{with the appearance of}} a sharp lipid phase transition above physiological temperatures. Transformation efficiencies correlated with <b>poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate</b> concentrations and with the intensity of the new phase transition.

The adopted model remained equally applicable to oxygen uptake rate and PHB profiles reflecting different feeding regimes and culture history. Sludge age was significant on the rate parameters of storage and direct growth (k(STO), mu(H 1)). while the feeding regime affected half saturation coefficients (K-STO, K-S 1). Changing the sludge age from 8 days to 2 days reduced the K-STO value from 8. 0 day(- 1) to 6. 5 day(- 1) and increased the corresponding mu(H 1) value from 1. 5 day(- 1) to 2. 5 day(- 1), regardless of the feeding regime; conversely, changing from pulse to continuous feeding reduced K-STO while increasing K-S for the SBR operation at the same sludge age.

The pha operon was fused to the negatively regulated tac promoter and cloned into a vector in which the copy number is temperature dependent. A two-phase process was employed to produce PHB during fed-batch growth. In the growth phase, the culture was maintained at a low temperature. Under this condition, the plasmid copy number was depressed and the number of LacI proteins was sufficient to repress tacupha transcription. The production phase was initiated by temperature upshift. At the elevated temperature, the number of plasmids surpassed the number of LacI repressors, which resulted in rapid induction of tacupha transcription, synthesis of poly-beta-hydroxyalkanoate-specific proteins, and polymer synthesis.

Space-filling molecular models and molecular energy minimization methods (Charmm) were used to develop and evaluate a plausible structure for the complex. It is proposed that the polyhydroxybutyrate forms an exolipophilic-endopolarophilic helix around an inner framework helix of calcium polyphosphate.

Furthermore, larval performance was the best when PHB was delivered to the larvae 24 h before challenge (P < 0. 05).
