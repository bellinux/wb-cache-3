40|$|Abstract: Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this case study is to {{illustrate}} the difficulty of capturing value by an upstream supplier in a mature business market. The case shows how successful market introduction and value capturing, {{especially in the case}} of mature markets, are dependent on the dominant logic of the participants in the supply chain. Scholars can use the case for a class discussion on value pricing. Design/methodology/approach: The approach takes the form of a multilevel case design as part of a larger project on value-based <b>pricing</b> <b>sponsored</b> by the Dutch foundation of Technique and Marketing (STEM). Findings: In this mature and technical industry, the dominant mindset of suppliers and customers turns out to be heavily biased towards cost containment. Also, a volume orientation and a short-term perspective are typical. This leads to adversarial relations in the supply chain, which makes it difficult to jointly introduce new value concepts. Notwithstanding the innovativeness of a new packaging concept with clear potential advantages to all downstream players, it turns out to be difficult to align these players during market introduction. In sum, existing relations, pricing structures and competitive behavior hinder new concept introduction and a value-sharing perspective. Research limitations/implications: With its focus on one industry and one product introduction, this case cannot be generalized to all business settings. However, the in-depth analysis stimulates further research on value-based pricing to incorporate industry characteristics and the pricing reality embedded in the dominant logic of the industry. Practical implications: The experience of this company might inspire other managers operating in similar environments. Managers should not underestimate the challenge of changing their pricing approaches. Turning to a value-based pricing might require a sustained effort in order to change industry rules. Originality/value: The literature hails value-based pricing without often considering the implementation difficulties. Especially upstream players have difficulties in capturing value inherent in their offerings...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{sponsored}} search auctions advertisers typically pay a fixed {{amount per}} click that their advertisements receive. In particular, the advertiser and the publisher {{enter into a contract}} (e. g., the publisher displays the ad; the advertiser pays the publisher 10 cents per click), and each party’s subjective value for such a contract depends on their estimated click-through rates (CTR) for the ad. Starting from this motivating example, we define and analyze a class of contract auctions that generalize the classical second price auction. As an application, we introduce impression-plus-click <b>pricing</b> for <b>sponsored</b> search, in which advertisers pay {{a fixed amount}} per impression plus an additional amount if their ad is clicked. Of note, when the advertiser’s estimated CTR is higher than the publisher’s estimated CTR, both parties find negative click payments advantageous, where the advertiser pays the publisher a premium for the impression but the publisher then pays the advertiser per click. ...|$|R

The primary finding of the study that NASCAR sponsorship announcements were accompanied by the largest increases in shareholder wealth ever recorded in the marketing literature in response to a voluntary marketing program represents a striking and unambiguous stock market endorsement of the sponsorships.

A multiple regression analysis of firm-specific stock price changes and select corporate and sponsorship attributes indicates that NASCAR sponsorships with more successful racing teams, corporate (as opposed to product or divisional) sponsorships, and sponsorships with direct ties to the consumer automotive industry are all positively correlated with perceived sponsorship success, while corporate cash flow per share (a well-known proxy for agency conflicts within the firm) is negatively related with shareholder approval. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{study how}} an {{advertiser}} changes his/her bid <b>prices</b> in <b>sponsored</b> search, by modeling his/her rationality. Predicting the bid changes of advertisers {{with respect to}} their campaign performances is a key capability of search engines, since {{it can be used to}} improve the offline evaluation of new advertising technologies and the forecast of future revenue of the search engine. Previous work on advertiser behavior modeling heavily relies on the assumption of perfect advertiser rationality; however, in most cases, this assumption does not hold in practice. Advertisers may be unwilling, incapable, and/or constrained to achieve their best response. In this paper, we explicitly model these limitations in the rationality of advertisers, and build a probabilistic advertiser behavior model from the perspective of a search engine. We then use the expected payoff to define the objective function for an advertiser to optimize given his/her limited rationality. By solving the optimization problem with Monte Carlo, we get a prediction of mixed bid strategy for each advertiser in the next period of time. We examine the effectiveness of our model both directly using real historical bids and indirectly using revenue prediction and click number prediction. Our experimental results based on the sponsored search logs from a commercial search engine show that the proposed model can provide a more accurate prediction of advertiser bid behaviors than several baseline methods...|$|R

Furthermore since the space of all searches is much larger than the set of advertisers, it is useful to use the semantic relationship of search terms within pricing algorithms. Our main results show how to take algorithms that solve these pricing problems and convert them into auctions with good game-theoretic properties and provably good performance. 1...|$|R

Thus the content service becomes appealing to more users and potentially generates more profit gain to the content provider. In this paper, we consider a sponsored data market with a monopoly network service provider, a single content provider, and multiple users. In particular, we model the interactions of three entities as a two-stage Stackelberg game, where the service provider and content provider act as the leaders determining the <b>pricing</b> and <b>sponsoring</b> strategies, respectively, in the first stage, and the users act as the followers deciding on their data demand in the second stage. We investigate the mutual interaction of the service provider and content provider in two cases: (i) competitive case, where the content provider and service provider optimize their strategies separately and competitively, each aiming at maximizing the profit and revenue, respectively; and (ii) cooperative case, where the two providers jointly optimize their strategies, {{with the purpose of}} maximizing their aggregate profits. We analyze the sub-game perfect equilibrium in both cases. Via extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the network effects significantly improve the payoff of three entities in this market, i. e., utilities of users, the profit of content provider and the revenue of service provider.

50|$|Furthermore, {{by wearing}} team apparel, fans can {{visually}} identify {{with one another}} resulting an increased likelihood of opportunities to engage with others socially through this point of connection. (Tobar, 2006). For example, a study on NASCAR fans found that their personal identity {{was connected to the}} brand itself as they felt connected to the larger community of NASCAR revealing an emotional connection to the brand. This indicates that their fan loyalty will result in the notion that fans are naturally more resistant to the promotional efforts of competing brands (i.e. lower price offers) as their emotional commitment to NASCAR is greatly embedded in their sense of identity. When they associate themselves with the sponsors because of the sponsor’s relation to the brand, they are solidifying their relationship with NASCAR and are therefore reinforcing their identity. Consequently, their fan loyalty translates into brand loyalty so long as the sponsor remains attached to the subject of their fanaticism, NASCAR, meaning they are less price sensitive and more willing to pay premium <b>prices</b> for <b>sponsor’s</b> products or services. Another aspect of consumer behaviour regarding fan loyalty is the existence of consumption communities where members feel a sense of unity when they participate in the group consumption of brand sponsors’ goods and services further strengthening their ties to a brand and it’s sponsors. However, a strategy sports marketers use to appeal to a wider range of fan identities, is to sponsor more than one club in sports such as soccer. This is so they are careful not to come across as a singularly affiliated club brand, where the opinion or perceptions of opposing teams’ fans would be one of disfavour towards them.|$|R
