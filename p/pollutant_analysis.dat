40|$|Environmental data {{analysis}} {{is one of}} the most important issue for assessing the impact of polluting agents in areas in which human activities have altered the standard natural development and evolution of air, water and ground. In particular, physical and chemical polluting agents need to be monitored and controlled, in order to reduce the dangers to human health due both to long term and to short term, but high level, exposures. In this paper, the attention will be mainly focused on the assessment and prediction of acoustical noise, and partially to air pollution {{data analysis}}.

40|$|PURPOSE: This {{technical}} note {{describes how the}} stress responses of common bioassay organisms {{can be used to}} identify toxic contaminants and their bioavailability in sediment. The freshwater non-biting midge, Chironomus tentans, responds to contaminant exposure by making proteins to detoxify chemicals or repair damage, in addition to other responses. Midges make new proteins by transcription, or copying, of genes into messenger RNA (mRNA) that are used to make many copies of a protein. A snapshot of what the midge is sensing and how it is responding can be found by looking at the mRNAs that are being made (mRNA profiling). Short exposures to common sediment contaminants result in patterns of mRNA profiles that indicate the class and type of the bioavailable chemical. Short analysis time and very high sample throughput enable this approach {{to be used as a}} means to rapidly screen large numbers of sediment samples for exposure and/or toxicity. These analyses are faster and cheaper than traditional priority <b>pollutant</b> <b>analysis</b> with the added potential of identifying bioavailable contaminants by the effect they cause in a bioassay organism. BACKGROUND: Decisions on the identification, assessment, and management of contaminated dredged material are frequently limited by information on how much risk the material poses. ...|$|E

40|$|DNA {{sequencing}} {{methods used}} for whale product identification are limited because such methods are expensive and time consuming. As a result, {{the number of}} samples that can be processed and analyzed in each survey is too small given the need for genetic surveys of current and emerging whale product markets. Using high-throughput genetic typing technology, we are developing more rapid and costefficient assay procedures to identify cetacean products. We designed molecular probes for use in one such technique and have begun testing this method for use in large-scale surveys of commercial whale markets. Such techniques for whale product identification will allow international programs to accurately monitor the identity of commercial whale products, and allow any future increase in commercial whaling to be accomplished with minimal impact on threatened species and populations. We tested molecular probes with products from a new (1999) survey of Japanese commercial whale markets (N= 130) and with products from additional species collected in previous surveys. Protected great whales detected in the 1999 survey included two products derived from different humpback whales, two products derived from sperm whales, and one product derived from a Bryde’s whale.

40|$|Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) {{has been}} {{established}} as a good and relatively sensitive method for qualitative analysis of powders and rough surfaces. The technique is non-destructive and high quality spectra can be easily obtained without extensive sample preparation. The capacity of the method for qualitative analysis of functional groups has been demonstrated in numerous fields. The potential of DRIFTS for quantitative analysis was recognized quite early as well. However, many theoretical and practical problems do appear when the method is applied for this purpose, requiring very accurate sampling procedure. The effect on reflectance spectra of several parameters influencing sampling has been studied. Conventionally, a simplified relation derived from the phenomenological continuum theory of Kubelka-Munk is used in order to relate the concentration of a chromophore, dispersed in a sample, to {{the intensity of the}} diffusely reflected radiation. In practice however, this equation can be used only for ideal systems diluted in a non-absorbing scattering matrix and in a limited concentration range. Preparation of such idealized samples in a reproducible way is difficult. Quantitative analysis of opaque non-diluted systems such as those found in the real world is of high interest. In many fields, like for example in thin layer chromatography, stationary phase studies, environmental <b>pollutant</b> <b>analysis,</b> and industrial quality control or heterogeneous catalysis, it is desirable to quantitatively characterize samples {{as close as possible to}} their original state. In our own effort to do quantitative spectroscopy of powders, we have investigated the case of non-diluted samples. Model systems constituted of two types of silica powders (Cab-O-Sil and LiChrosorb) of very different morphology were prepared. The surface hydroxyl groups of SiO 2 were exposed to a silylation reaction with an aminosilane containing a suitable chromophore. Known superficial concentrations of molecules carrying a cyano functional group were anchored by this way on the powder surface. A quantitative model of diffuse reflectance, derived from the general hyperbolic solutions of the Kubelka-Munk equations has been developed, taking into account different parameters such as the absorption of the silica substrate, finite thickness of the sample, specular reflection, as well as diffusion and absorption coefficients profiles within the depth of the scattering layer. Application of this model gives a quite good description of measured diffuse reflectance, in cases where the simple Kubelka-Munk relation fails. Use of a Mar quardt type non-linear least square adjustment method to the experimental data allows moreover the determination of other parameters of interest. A new FTIR analytical technique, based on a PVDF photo-pyroelectric film detector, has also been developed, which has enabled for the first time sequential measurement of diffuse reflectance and diffuse transmittance of the same sample without any change in the optical geometry and sample manipulation. Another multilayer discontinuum theory, more suited for particles of diameter larger than the radiation wavelength, has been developed and successfully applied to diffuse reflectance and transmittance measurements of sodium carbonate powders...|$|E

CD-ROM IncludedProject Management constraints and operationalisation dimensions of Vehicle Emission Testing (VET) program Urban air pollution was becoming an issue in Sri Lanka especially towards late 1990 ’s. It was evident that the transport sector was the largest contributor to the overall total emissions for all <b>pollutants.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of air quality data had suggested the ever increasing vehicle fleetas the major culprit. Poor vehicle maintenance, absence of a system to monitor, control and regulate vehicular emissions, and low quality fuels contributed towards increased emissions from vehicles. Therefore, government intervention was required to reverse the trend of deteriorating air quality and mitigate the accompanying adverse health effects caused by exposure to fine particles, lead and other vehicular emissions. With the roles, responsibilities and expertise dispersed within several organizations, to curb air pollution, in year 2001, created Air Resource Management Center (AirMAC) : a multistakeholder organization as a strong partnership institution linking all stakeholder agencies. AirMAC initiated Vehicle Emission Testing (VET) to monitor and control level of emission generated by vehicles in Sri Lanka in 2008. The main sponsoring body of the VET programme is Ministry of Environment in Sri Lanka. This {{study was conducted to}} determine critical constraints to the effective implementation of VET programme in Sri Lanka, particularly from a project management perspective.

Boundary layer analysis from models of cherry tree (Prunus avium) leaves indicate that the minimum conductance value within these chambers is 2 cm s− 1...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Our {{goal was}} to {{evaluate}} the relationship between cause-specific postneonatal infant mortality and chronic early-life exposure to particulate matter and gaseous air pollutants across the United States. METHODS: We linked county-specific monitoring data for particles with aerodiameter of ≤ 2. 5 µm (PM 2. 5) and ≤ 10 µm (PM 10), ozone, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide to birth and death records for infants born from 1999 to 2002 in U. S. counties with> 250, 000 residents. For each infant, we calculated the average concentration of each pollutant over the first 2 months of life. We used logistic generalized estimating equations to estimate odds ratios of postneonatal mortality for all causes, respiratory causes, {{sudden infant death syndrome}} (SIDS), and all other causes for each pollutant, controlling for individual maternal factors (race, marital status, education, age, and primiparity), percentage of county population below poverty, region, birth month, birth year, and other <b>pollutants.</b> This <b>analysis</b> includes about 3. 5 million births, with 6, 639 postneonatal infant deaths. RESULTS: After adjustment for demographic and other factors and for other pollutants, we found adjusted odds ratios of 1. 16 [95 % confidence interval (CI), 1. 06 – 1. 27] for a 10 -µg/m 3 increase in PM 10 for respiratory causes and 1. 20 (95 % CI, 1. 09 – 1. 32) for a 10 -ppb increase in ozone an...|$|R
40|$|EPA is {{developing}} a new mobile source emissions model that is comprehensive in source category, <b>pollutant</b> and <b>analysis</b> scale. A primary impetus for this effort is the National Research Council’s review of EPA’s mobile source modeling program, published in 2000, which recommended a) {{the development of a}} modeling system more capable of supporting smaller-scale analyses; b) improved characterization of emissions from high-emitting vehicles, heavy-duty vehicles, and off-road sources; c) improved characterization of particulate matter and toxic emissions; d) improved model evaluation and uncertainty assessments; and e) a long-term planning effort coordinated with other governmental entities engaged in emissions modeling. A cross-agency team representing OTAQ, OAQPS, ORD and Regional offices published an initial proposal to address these recommendations in April 2001. Since then, work has progressed on developing a conceptual design and software framework for the new modeling system. This design has been informed by recent advances in subregional emissions modeling and considers how the new mobile source emissions model should interact with new generation transportation and air quality models. Other important considerations of the design are how to capitalize on methods for improved characterization of in-use emissions, such as on-board emissions measurement, and how to incorporate model validation and uncertainty evaluation into the model structure. We present the latest information on a design and implementation plan for the model. ...|$|R
