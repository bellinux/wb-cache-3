40|$|Competitive {{ability of}} {{transgenic}} oilseed rape transformed with a pea lectin gene was estimated by comparisons of its performance when grown {{in a mixture}} with its non-transgenic counterpart and when grown singly, with and without <b>pollen</b> <b>beetles</b> present. The experiments were carried out in cages, once with bumblebees as pollinators and once without. In the absence of herbivory but {{with the presence of}} bumblebees, singly grown plant lines without lectin generally performed better than lines with lectin. <b>Pollen</b> <b>beetles</b> affected plant growth and reproduction, but there were no consistent differences between the lectin and non-lectin plant lines indicating that the transgenic trait did not protect plants from pest attack. Herbivory reduced the number of seeds when bumblebees were present. In the absence of bumblebees, however, plants produced more seeds with <b>pollen</b> <b>beetles</b> than without, indicating that some pollination was carried out by the beetles. Efficient pollination affected the competitive abilities of the lines; lectin lines were more competitive with bumblebees present and the reverse was true when bumblebees were absent. In the presence of bumblebees, lectin lines gained from being grown mixed with its non-transgenic counterpart. Because the transgenic plants expressed pea lectin in developing pollen it is possible that pollen quality in those plants was reduced, which may explain why the lectin lines had an advantage over non-lectin lines when exchange of pollen between the two plant types was facilitated by bumblebees...|$|R

40|$|Glucosinolate {{myrosinase}} {{system is}} well-established defense mechanism against insect herbivores feed on plants from Brassicaceae family. This defense mechanism {{is also known}} as the mustard oil bomb which bring myrosinase enzyme and glucosinolate together upon insect attack and tissue disruption and cause glucosinolate hydrolysis by myrosinase enzyme activity. Glucosinolate and its hydrolysis products have a deterring effect on herbivores, and protect plant parts from insect damage. The modified plants have been named MINELESS due to lack of myrosin cells. The aim {{of this study was to}} get an insight into defense responses of MINELESS and wild- type Brassica napus plants after being challenged by insects Delia radicum, Delia floralis, Mamestra brassicae and Meligethes aeneus. The hypothesis behind this work were due to lack of myrosin cells and the enzyme myrosinase, the glucosinolate-myrosinase system is modulated and MINELESS plants possess more glucosinolates in plant tissues. Glucosinolate have adverse and deterring effects on insect herbivores, and larvae of generalist herbivore, Mamestra brassicae preferred to feed on wild-type cotyledons of Brassica napus plants, which contain lower amounts of glucosinolates than those of MINELESS. Role of glucosinolates on attraction of <b>pollen</b> <b>beetles,</b> Meligethes aeneus, is not exactly known, however, <b>pollen</b> <b>beetles</b> are attracted by glucosinolates hydrolysis products, isothyocyanates. Wild-type plants were preferred by <b>pollen</b> <b>beetles</b> for feeding over MINELESS plants which possess high levels of glucosinolates, but low levels of isothiocyanates due to lack of myrosinase activity. Four glucosinolates were detected with the highest amount of indol- 3 -ylmethyl- (I 3 M) glucosinolate both in control and insect challenged aboveground tissues, with slightly higher amounts in MINELESS plants than wild-type. However total glucosinolate levels did not show exact difference between MINELESS and wild-type plants. I 3 M glucosinolates levels increased upon herbivore feeding in all treatment days. Increasing days of treatment increased levels of aliphatic glucosinolate, 5 -methylsulphinylpentyl- (5 MSOP) glucosinolate and decreased levels of indole glucosinolate, I 3 M glucosinolate. In both no-choice and free choice experiments, M. brassicae larvae consumed more wild-type cotyledons than those of MINELESS. In no-choice experiments consumed area of cotyledons increased in correlation with increasing number of days of feeding, and wild-type plants were consumed more than MINELESS plants. iii The ablation of myrosin cells and consequent lack of myrosinase activity did not affect feeding by <b>pollen</b> <b>beetles</b> in both feeding experiments. Wild-type buds were damaged more than MINELESS buds, however the difference was not significant.

40|$|Reducing {{the use of}} {{insecticides}} is {{an important}} issue for agriculture today. Sowing wildflower strips along field margins or within crops represents a promising tool to support natural enemy populations in agricultural landscapes and, thus, enhance conservation biological control. However, it is important to sow appropriate flower species that attract natural enemies efficiently. The presence of prey and hosts may also guide natural enemies to wildflower strips, potentially preventing them from migrating into adjacent crops. Here, we assessed how seven flower traits, along with the abundance of <b>pollen</b> <b>beetles</b> (Meligethes spp., Coleoptera: Nitidulidae) and true weevils (Ceutorhynchus spp., Coleoptera: Curculionidae), affect the density of parasitoids of these two coleopterans in wildflower strips sown in an oilseed rape field in Gembloux (Belgium). Only flower traits, not host (i. e. <b>pollen</b> <b>beetles</b> and true weevils) abundance, significantly affected the density of parasitoids. Flower colour, ultraviolet reflectance and nectar availability were the main drivers affecting parasitoids.

40|$|Loss in seed {{yield and}} {{therefore}} decrease in plant fitness due to simultaneous attacks by multiple herbivores {{is not necessarily}} additive, as demonstrated in evolutionary studies on wild plants. However, {{it is not clear}} how this transfers to crop plants that grow in very different conditions compared to wild plants. Nevertheless, loss in crop seed yield caused by any single pest is most often studied in isolation although crop plants are attacked by many pests that can cause substantial yield losses. This is especially important for crops able to compensate and even overcompensate for the damage. We investigated the interactive impacts on crop yield of four insect pests attacking different plant parts at different times during the cropping season. In 15 oilseed rape fields in Sweden, we estimated the damage caused by seed and stem weevils, <b>pollen</b> <b>beetles,</b> and pod midges. Pest pressure varied drastically among fields with very low correlation among pests, allowing us to explore interactive impacts on yield from attacks by multiple species. The plant damage caused by each pest species individually had, as expected, either no, or a negative impact on seed yield and the strongest negative effect was caused by <b>pollen</b> <b>beetles.</b> However, seed yield increased when plant damage caused by both seed and stem weevils was high, presumably due to the joint plant compensatory reaction to insect attack leading to overcompensation. Hence, attacks by several pests can change the impact on yield of individual pest species. Economic thresholds based on single species, on which pest management decisions currently rely, may therefore result in economically suboptimal choices being made and unnecessary excessive use of insecticides...|$|R

In a geographically broad network of farmer’s fields, we analysed the effect of various crop management factors and of the surrounding field environment on a large range of insects known to damage WOSR: root maggot (Delia radicum L.), {{cabbage stem flea beetle}} (Psylliodes chrysocephala L.), rape stem weevil (Ceuthorhynchus napi Gyl) and <b>pollen</b> <b>beetle</b> (Meligethes aeneus F.). Our results confirm the effect of sowing date, plant density and soil tillage regime on root maggot attacks and cabbage stem flea beetle larva infestation. Early sowing tended to increase root maggot damage whereas it was associated with a lower level of attack of cabbage stem flea beetle. High plant density tended to decrease the damage or the attack of all insects. We show that nitrogen availability in the soil affect cabbage stem flea beetle, stem weevil levels and <b>pollen</b> <b>beetle</b> damage: the negative effect of soil nitrogen content on <b>pollen</b> <b>beetle</b> damage {{may be related to the}} significant effect of nitrogen on plant vigour and, therefore, to the compensation of <b>pollen</b> <b>beetle</b> damage on new racemes.
