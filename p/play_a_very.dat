5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the regular}} season, Boston College was ranked 26th nationally in total defense, and 2nd nationally in run defense. Its pass defense, however, was ranked 106th in the country, and since Boston College was without senior cornerback DeJuan Tribble, who was {{recovering}} from a sprained knee ligament, it was expected that the Eagles' linebackers would have to <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> good game to stop Virginia Tech's passing offense. Jo-Lonn Dunbar, who had been named to the preseason watch list for the Bronko Nagurski Trophy (awarded to the top defensive player in the country) was expected to fill the gaps and stop both rushing and passing elements of Virginia Tech's offense.|$|E
5|$|Perforator veins <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> {{special role}} in the venous system, {{carrying}} blood from superficial to deep veins. During the muscular systole their valves close and stop any blood flow coming from the deep to the superficial veins. When their valves become insufficient, {{they are responsible for}} a rapid deterioration in existing varicose disease and for the development of venous ulcers. Detection of insufficient perforators is important because they need to be ligatured. However, the detection of competent ones is as important because they may be used strategically in new techniques of conservative surgery, for example a minimally invasive CHIVA. The ultrasonography report will include insufficient and continent perforators, which will also be shown on venous mapping. To test these veins properly, the examiner will need to use some techniques like the Paraná maneuver, toe and foot flexion, and hyper-extension on tip toes.|$|E

25|$|The common view among {{economic}} historians is {{that the}} Great Depression ended {{with the advent of}} World War II.

25|$|The United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine in late 1947 led {{to civil}} war in Palestine, the end of Mandatory Palestine, and the Israeli Declaration of Independence on 14 May 1948. With nationhood, the ongoing civil war was {{transformed}} into a state conflict between Israel and the Arab states, the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. All this led to Palestinian refugees crossing the border into Lebanon. Palestinians would go on to <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> important role in future Lebanese civil conflicts, while the establishment of Israel radically changed the region around Lebanon.|$|E
25|$|The {{members of}} the MADS-box family of {{transcription}} factors <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> important and evolutionarily conserved role in flower development. According to the ABC model of flower development, three zones - A,B and C - are generated within the developing flower primordium, {{by the action of}} some transcription factors, that are {{members of the}} MADS-box family. Among these, the functions of the B and C domain genes have been evolutionarily more conserved than the A domain gene. Many of these genes have arisen through gene duplications of ancestral members of this family. Quite a few of them show redundant functions.|$|E

25|$|Planetary nebulae may <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> {{important}} role in galactic evolution. Newly born stars consist almost entirely of hydrogen and helium, but as stars evolve through the Asymptotic Giant Branch phase, they create heavier elements via nuclear fusion which are eventually expelled by strong stellar winds. Planetary nebulae usually contain larger proportions of elements such as carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, and these are recycled into the interstellar medium via these powerful winds. In turn, planetary nebulae greatly enrich the Milky Way and their nebulae with these heavier elements – collectively known by astronomers as metals and specifically referred to by the metallicity parameter Z.|$|E
25|$|Sutherland was {{partially}} deaf and therefore {{decided not to}} <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> active part in politics which was the path well worn by his contemporary peers. Instead he expended his energies by spending some of his vast wealth which he inherited from his father on improving his homes. In 1845, he employed Sir Charles Barry to make vast alterations to Dunrobin Castle. Barry transformed the place into the 189-room ducal palace which we see today. In addition to Dunrobin, the Duke also had Barry completely remodel his Staffordshire seat of Trentham Hall, Cliveden House in Buckinghamshire, and the family's London townhouse, Stafford House, which was the most valuable private home {{in the whole of}} London.|$|E
25|$|Later in his reign, {{when the}} empire had {{recovered}} territory and its economic condition had improved, the increased monetary revenue available allowed Alexios {{to impose a}} greater regularity on the army, with {{a higher proportion of}} troops raised directly by the state; however, the extended imperial family continued to <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> prominent role. In 1107 Alexios created an elite corps of 300 young, aspiring commanders. He brought them into his household and trained them personally. The best of them were then given commands in the army. In this manner Alexios improved the quality of his field officers and the level of control he could exercise over them. This was the army that his successors inherited and further modified.|$|E

25|$|Habituation {{involves}} decreased {{levels of}} attention and responsiveness to a stimulus {{that is no longer}} perceived as being novel. In the realm of olfactory memory, habituation refers to a decrease in responsiveness to an odor as a result of prolonged exposure (restricted to a certain repeated stimulus), which involves adaptation of cells in the olfactory system. Receptor neurons and mitral cells located in the olfactory system adapt in response to odors. This includes the involvement of piriform cortical neurons which adapt rapidly, more completely and selectively to novel odors and are also thought to <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> important role in the habituation of odors. Norepinephrine is considered to {{have an effect on the}} functioning of the mitral cells by increasing their responsiveness. Acetylcholine is also regarded as an important neurotransmitter involved in the habituation of olfactory stimulus, though the exact means through which it operates are not yet clear.|$|E
25|$|In the Mavericks' debut game, {{taking place}} in the brand-new Reunion Arena, the Mavericks {{defeated}} the Spurs, 103–92. But the Mavs started the season with a 6–40 record on their way to finishing 15–67. However, the Mavericks did make a player acquisition that, while it seemed minor at the time, turned out to <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> important role {{in the early years of}} their franchise. Journeyman 6ft 3 in guard Brad Davis, who played for the Anchorage Northern Knights of the Continental Basketball Association, was tracked down and signed by the Mavs in December. At the time, there was absolutely no reason to expect that Davis would be any better than the expansion-level talent the Mavs had. But he started the Mavs' final 26 games, led the team in assists, and his career soared. He spent the next twelve years with the Mavericks, and eventually his number 15 jersey was retired. The Mavericks also marked the first NBA team to have a profitable debut season, with an average of 7,789 spectators.|$|E
