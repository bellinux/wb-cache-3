40|$|Part of {{the slow}} {{decline in the}} <b>post{{neonatal}}</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> and the rapid decline in the neonatal mortality rate during the 1970 s {{may have been due}} to a post-ponement of some neonatal deaths into the postneonatal period. The authors hypothesized that any such postponement should be accompanied by a lack of decline, or even an increase, in late neonatal and postneonatal mortality rates among low birth weight babies and babies dying of conditions originating in the perinatal period. To examine this theory, the authors used vital records data to compare infant mortality rates in Massachusetts during 1970 - 1972 with rates during 1978 - 1980. Log-linear hazard models were used to calculate death rates, while controlling for changes in maternal age, race, education, and prior repro-ductive history. The authors found that babies of birth weight under 1, 500 g had no decline in late neonatal mortality rates and babies of birth weight under 2, 500 g had no decline in postneonatal mortality rates. Babies of birth weight 500 - 999 g had an increased <b>postneonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> (rate ratio = 2. 4; 95 % confidence limits = 1. 0 - 5. 4).

40|$|Postneonatal {{mortality}} is the subset of infant mortality that includes deaths from 28 days up to 1 year. During the postneonatal period, the {{leading causes of}} death nationally are {{sudden infant death syndrome}} (SIDS), birth defects, and unintentional injuries. 14 During 2002 - 2004, an average of 81 postneonates per year died in Oregon. During this time period, the number one cause of death among postneonates was sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), accounting for nearly 30 percent of all deaths in this age group. 15 • Oregon’s <b>postneonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> for 2002 - 2004 was nearly 20 percent lower than the 2004 U.

However, Oregon has not achieved the Healthy People 2010 target of 1. 5 postneonatal deaths per 1, 000 live births. • From 1993 - 2004, postneonatal mortality in Oregon declined significantly – from 3. 2 to 1. 8 postneonatal deaths per 1, 000 liv...|$|E
40|$|For 1980 Singapore {{was found}} to have overall a more {{favourable}} birthweight distribution than England and Wales. The proportion of very low birthweight babies (less than 1500 g) and heavy babies (3500 g and over) was 0. 4 % and 18. 5 % in Singapore and 0. 7 % and 34. 9 % in England and Wales for live births, and 0. 6 % and 18. 5 % against 0. 9 % and 34. 7 % for total births. However, for low birthweight (less than 2500 g) Singapore with 7. 5 % in live births and 7. 9 % in total births had higher rates than England and Wales (6. 7 % and 7. 2 %).

40|$|This paper uses a panel {{data set}} {{comprising}} 23 cities {{for the years}} 1979 - 2002 in Taiwan and a fixed-effects model to find evidence {{of the effect of}} economic instability on infant, neonatal, and <b>postneonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates.</b> In addition, the effects of income, demographic factors, and the availability of medical resources are also examined in relation to the mortalities. The most important finding is that infant, neonatal, and <b>postneonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> move counter-cyclically with the city unemployment rate in Taiwan. The provision of national health insurance is also found to {{have a positive impact on}} the health of infants in Taiwan. Finally, the impact of economic instability on the infant, neonatal, and <b>postneonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> is found to be the strongest in the eastern part of Taiwan, which is the region with the fewest health care resources. The analysis provides evidence of the effects of economic instability on the infant, neonatal, and <b>postneonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> in a developing country, which are comparable to those of other countries and may provide some important insights into this issue.

40|$|Objective. This article {{analyzes}} the time-trends and causes of infant, neonatal, and <b>postneonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> in Mexico during the 1980 's. Material and methods. Data on infant deaths came from yearly tabulations (1980 to 1990) {{published by the}} Mexican government. Time-trends of <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> were determined by simple linear regression models. The parallelism test was performed for evaluating similarities in trends in neonatal and <b>postneonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> by causes. Results. During the 1980 's, infant <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> in Mexico declined from 40. 4 to 31. 1 / 1 000 (ß= - 0. 791). <b>Postneonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> showed a strong decrease (ß= - 0. 892), while neonatal <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> were almost stationary (ß= 0. 089). Significant rate decreases were observed for Intestinal infections, Pneumonia and influenza and all other causes while Certain perinatal problems, Congenital defects and Nutritional deficiencies increased. No changes were observed in Acute respiratory infections. The neonatal proportional mortality showed an incremental trend accounting for 37. 6 % in 1980 and ascending to 48. 8 % in 1990 of the mortality {{in the first year}} of life. Conclusions. This analysis indicates that the reduction in infant mortality in Mexico during the 1980 's was due to declining <b>postneonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> while neonatal <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> remain almost unchanged...|$|R

40|$|Among the 45, 204 {{live births}} in Birmingham {{in the three}} {{calendar}} years 1981 - 3, there were 218 postneonatal deaths, giving a <b>postneonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> of 4. 82 per 1000 live births. Postneonatal mortality rates were 4. 22 for whites, 5. 91 for Asians (relative risk 1. 26, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 04 to 1. 53) and 8. 20 for Afro-Caribbeans (relative risk 1. 78, 95 % CI 1. 25 to 2. 55). Among Asians malformations were common (3. 36) and {{sudden infant death syndrome}} rare (1. 18), in contrast to Afro-Caribbeans among whom the rates were 0. 66 and 5. 25, respectively. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated a significantly lower risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in Asians and significantly raised risks of SIDS in very low birthweight babies and those with unemployed parent(s).

40|$|Respiratory viruses {{have been}} {{identified}} at necropsy in the lungs of 13 out of 24 children who died with observed acute respiratory illness. The histological appearances of the lungs supported the association between virus and death {{in each of these}} 13 children and suggested an unidentified virus aetiology in a further five cases. Histological appearances compatible with bacterial infection were found in the lungs of only two of the 24 children. Similar virus and histological findings have been reported in about one-third of victims of the sudden infant death syndrome (cot deaths), indicating a rapid unobserved respiratory virus infection as the most likely mode of death in this group. Evidence that respiratory viruses may be involved in a larger proportion of sudden unexpected deaths, perhaps as antigens in a hypersensitivity reaction, is discussed.

40|$|Objectives: To {{review the}} {{incidence}} {{and characteristics of}} preventable childhood deaths in an urban population in the UK and {{to determine whether the}} excess of preventable deaths seen previously in Asian girls still exists. Design: A retrospective survey of childhood deaths from 1996 – 2002 classified in terms of preventability and compared with a previous study conducted 20 years earlier from 1976 – 82. Setting: The city of Wolverhampton in the UK. Main outcome measures: Deaths from all causes in {{children under the age of}} 5 years. Results: There has been a reduction in the number of deaths in all age groups and from all causes. The <b>postneonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> fell from 6. 5 / 1000 in 1976 to 3. 1 / 1000 live births in 2002 largely because of the fall in the numbers of deaths caused by sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Preventable deaths are still associated with low birth weight (p, 0. 001) and poverty (unemployment and overcrowding in the earlier study (p, 0. 05) and with the Townsend score in this study (p, 0. 02)). There were fewer deaths among Asians and no female excess. There was a new category not seen in the previous study, deaths caused by homicide.

40|$|Background: The infant <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> (IMR), {{defined as}} the annual number of deaths of infants {{under the age of}} one year per 1, 000 live births, is {{commonly}} used as an indicator of health in a population. A variety of factors are associated with the IMR, including maternal education level, quality of healthcare, access to health services, health insurance coverage, access to sanitation and clean water, public health practices, maternal health, and per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Infant mortality is often broken down into subgroups (early, late and <b>postneonatal</b> <b>mortality)</b> since <b>rates</b> and causes of death vary within these groups. A review of the literature has revealed a scarcity of current information regarding socioeconomic factors associated with infant mortality in Colombia specifically. A better understanding of the relationship between socioeconomic factors and infant <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> in Colombia will help to inform policy decisions at national and departmental levels. ^ Research Question: The goal of the current research is to describe the overall trend in infant <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> in Colombia between 2000 and 2011, to examine regional variation in early neonatal, late neonatal and <b>postneonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> in Colombia, and {{to examine the relationship between}} maternal education level, health insurance coverage, and departmental GDP on early neonatal, late neonatal and <b>postneonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> for the years 2000 - 2011. ^ Methods: A secondary data analysis of the vital statistics database collected by the National Administrative Department of Statistics was performed for years 2000 - 2011.

It is identified that over the 2001 - 2006 period there were no considerable changes of perinatal mortality level in Chernigov region. Over the 2007 - 2010 period this index dropped by 14 %, while in Ukraine – only by 6, 3 %. During 2001 - 2006 mortinatality in this area was lower than in Ukraine, however it had a tendency to increase (by 10, 6 %); in subsequent years this resulted in exceeding of national values. Level of mortinatality rate in Chernigov region over the 2001 - 2010 period dropped by 28, 6 %, while in Ukraine – by 19, 5 %.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} found {{associations}} between particulate air pollution and total and adult mortality. The relationship between particulate air pollution and mortality among infants has not been examined in the United States. This study evaluates the relationship between <b>postneonatal</b> infant <b>mortality</b> and particulate matter in the United States. Our study involved analysis of cohorts consisting of approximately 4 million infants born between 1989 and 1991 in states that report relevant covariates; this included 86 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in the United States. Data from the National Center for Health Statistics-linked birth/infant death records were combined at the MSA level with measurements of particulate matter 10 microns or less (PM 10) from the EPA's Aerometric Database. Infants were categorized as having high, medium, or low exposures based on tertiles of PM 10. Total and cause-specific <b>postneonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> were examined using logistic regression to control for demographic and environmental factors. Overall <b>postneonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> were 3. 1 among infants with low PM 10 exposures, 3. 5 among infants with medium PM 10 exposures, and 3. 7 among highly exposed infants. After adjustment for other covariates, the odds ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for total <b>postneonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> for the high exposure versus the low exposure group was 1. 10 (1. 04, 1. 16).

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the treatment, course and outcome of pregnancy in Finland using two cohorts of diabetic women. The clinical cohort consisted of data from all 210 women with Type 1 diabetes and their 296 pregnancies managed between 1986 and 1995 in the two northernmost provinces of Finland. The register-based study population included all 1442 mothers with a singleton birth who had insulin treatment during pregnancy in 1991 - 1995 according to the Medical Birth Register. Of these mothers, 954 (66 %) had pre-existing diabetes. Insulin-treated diabetes complicated 4. 5 / 1000 births in Finland in 1991 - 1995, the prevalence of Type 1 diabetes being 2. 9 / 1000 in the whole country and 3. 3 / 1000 in Northern Finland. In the 1990 's the care of these women shifted from tertiary level only to include the secondary level hospitals as well, and was more often carried out on an out-patient basis. This care policy in association with the self-monitoring of blood glucose levels contributed to an obvious improvement in glycaemic control during pregnancy. Despite that, the high proportion (73 %) of women entering pregnancy with unsatisfactory glycaemic control did not decrease during the study period. Retinopathy complicated 134 (45. 3 %) diabetic pregnancies, while clinical nephropathy was found in 23 (7. 8 %) cases. Although retinopathy was more often aggravated during the first pregnancy, the occurrence of retinopathy or its severe form was not increased at the beginning of consecutive pregnancies. Of the mothers, 50 (16. 9 %) had pre-eclampsia during pregnancy, and in 28 % of these cases it was classified as superimposed. It was found more often among primiparous than multiparous (25. 6 % vs. 11. 0 %, respectively), and its occurrence rose with the severity of diabetes. In both cohorts, the rates of preterm deliveries, Caesarean sections and large for gestational age (LGA) infants were significantly (p < 0. 001) higher in Type 1 diabetic pregnancies than in the background population. The rates of congenital anomalies (CA) were 540 - 629 / 10000 in two study populations, both being 2 - 3 -fold as compared to the background population. Cardiac malformations were most common, with anomalies in the genitourinary tract and the musculoskeletal organs being next in frequency. Sixty-three percent of malformed infants were boys. Though pregnancy itself was not found to worsen the prognosis of diabetes, at least in the short term, pregnancy in diabetic women still remains a high risk state with an increased rate of prematurity, operative deliveries, CAs and peri- and neonatal mortality. In order to decrease the mortality rate in diabetic births, attention should be directed at both the prevention of CA and at identifying the foetuses at risk for intrauterine death. The <b>postneonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> is also high, reflecting a shift in the deaths from the early neonatal period to a later age. Therefore, a combined mortality, including induced abortions, stillborns and infant deaths, would give a more realistic idea of the outcomes in diabetic pregnancies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The Chernobyl {{disaster}} in 1986 and {{the breakup of}} the former Soviet Union (FSU) in 1991 challenged the public health infrastructure in the former Soviet republic of Belarus. Because infant mortality is regarded as a sensitive measure of the overall health of a population, patterns of neonatal and postneonatal deaths were examined within the Mogilev region of Belarus between 1980 and 2000. Methods Employing administrative death files, this study utilized a regional cohort design that included all infant deaths occurring among persons residing within the Mogilev oblast of Belarus between 1980 and 2000. Patterns of death and death rates were examined across 3 intervals: 1980 – 1985 (pre-Chernobyl), 1986 – 1991 (post-Chernobyl & pre-FSU breakup), and 1992 – 2000 (post-Chernobyl & post-FSU breakup). Results Annual infant <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> declined during the 1980 s, increased during the early 1990 s, and have remained stable thereafter. While infant <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> in Mogilev have decreased since the period 1980 – 1985 among both males and females, this decrement appears due to decreases in <b>postneonatal</b> <b>mortality.</b> <b>Rates</b> of <b>postneonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> in Mogilev have decreased since the period 1980 – 1985 among both males and females. Analyses of trends for infant mortality and neonatal mortality demonstrated continuous decreases between 1990, followed by a bell-shaped excess in the 1990 's. Compared to <b>rates</b> of infant <b>mortality</b> for other countries, rates in the Mogilev region are generally higher than rates for the United States, but lower than rates in Russia. During the 1990 s, rates for both neonatal and <b>postneonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> in Mogilev were two times the comparable rates for East and West Germany. Conclusions While neonatal <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> in Mogilev have remained stable, <b>rates</b> for <b>postneonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> have decreased among both males and females during the period examined. Infant <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> in the Mogilev region of Belarus remain elevated compared to rates for other western countries, but lower than rates in Russia. The public health infrastructure might attempt to assure that prenatal, maternal, and postnatal care is maximized. </p...|$|R
40|$|The Rural Infant Care Program (RICP), {{initiated}} in 1979, {{was developed to}} improve perinatal health care in ten rural sites with histories of high infant <b>mortality</b> <b>rates.</b> Time-series regression models indicate that neonatal <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> were reduced, following program initiation, by 2. 6 per 1, 000 live births (p =. 0002); black neonatal <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> were reduced by an estimated 4. 5 per 1, 000 (p =. 0004). Three sets of comparison areas exhibited no significant changes in <b>rates.</b> <b>Postneonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> did not increase in the target areas following initiation of RICP, indicating that deaths were not merely being postponed. Nine of ten individual sites showed reductions in infant mortality following program initiation. Birthweight-specific mortality data indicated that the decline was due mainly to reductions in neonatal mortality among low-birthweight infants. No reductions {{in the incidence of}} low birthweight were observed in the target areas. Substantial gaps in the delivery of prenatal care remained due to the continuing poverty of the population and the resultant lack of financial coverage for health services. We conclude that improved perinatal medical care can reduce infant mortality in poor rural areas to average levels experienced in the United States, and that the high rates still observed in some rural counties are unnecessary...|$|R

40|$|In recent decades, {{neonatal}} and <b>postneonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> {{have declined}} {{overall in the}} United States. Yet, the <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> for black infants continue to be approximately twice those for white infants. With the use of data from 45 of the 53 vital statistics reporting areas that participated in the 1980 National Infant Mortality Surveillance project, we extended previous State analyses to describe differences, nationally, in neonatal and <b>postneonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> risks for black and white infants according to gestational age and birth weight. After restricting our analysis to single-delivery infants with known and plausible combinations of gestational age of 26 or more weeks and birth weights of 500 grams (g) or more, the neonatal mortality risk (NMR) [...] that is, {{the number of deaths}} to infants less than 28 days of life per 1, 000 live births [...] for black infants was 1. 6 times higher than the NMR for whites. This difference was largely explained by two findings: First, although the NMR was lower for black than for white infants with gestational ages of less than 38 weeks and birth weights less than 3, 000 g, that advantage was heavily outweighed by the higher percentage of such births among blacks, accounting for roughly two-thirds of the overall difference in NMR between blacks and whites. Second, most of the remaining difference in NMR was accounted for by higher NMRs among black infants with gestational ages of 38 or more weeks and birth weights of 3, 000 g or more. A comparison of the lowest mortality risk for any combination of birth weight and gestational age showed that the black NMR was 1. 89 times higher than the white NMR. The <b>postneonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> risk (PNMR) [...] PNMR equals the number of deaths to infants 28 days to less than 1 year of life per 1, 000 neonatal survivors [...] for black infants was 2. 09 times the PNMR for white infants. Black infants had higher PNMRs than white infants for nearly all combinations of birth weight and gestational age. Higher PNMRs among infants with gestational ages of 38 or more weeks and birth weights of 2, 500 g or more accounted for 43 percent of the difference in PNMR between black infants and white infants. Eliminating the U. S. black-white infant mortality disparity will require not only reducing the higher frequency of prematurity and low birth weight among black infants, but also improving the survival during both the neonatal and postneonatal periods of term black infants with normal birth weights...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE. Our {{goal was}} to {{investigate}} whether outcome in extremely low birth weight infants changes over time in Finland. PATIENTS AND METHODS. All infants with a birth weight < 1000 g born in Finland in 1996 - 1997 and 1999 - 2000 {{were included in the}} study. Perinatal and follow-up data were collected in a national extremely low birth weight infant research register. Data concerning cerebral palsy and visual impairment were obtained from hospitals, the national discharge, and visual impairment registers. RESULTS. A total of 529 and 511 extremely low birth weight infants were born during 1996 - 1997 and 1999 - 2000. No changes were detected in prenatal, perinatal, neonatal, and <b>postneonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> between the periods. The survival rates including stillborn infants were 40 % and 44 %. The incidence of respiratory distress syndrome and septicemia increased from 1996 - 1997 to 1999 - 2000 (75 % vs 83 % and 23 % vs 31 %). The overall incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage increased (29 % vs 37 %), but the incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage grades 3 through 4 did not (16 % vs 17 %). The rates of oxygen dependency at the age corresponding with 36 gestational weeks, retinopathy of prematurity stages 3 to 5, cerebral palsy, and severe visual impairment did not change. Mortality remained higher in 1 university hospital area during both periods compared with the other 4 areas, but no regional differences in morbidity were detected during the later period. CONCLUSIONS. No significant changes were detected in birth or <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> in extremely low birth weight infants born in Finland during the late 1990 s, but some neonatal morbidities seemed to increase. Regional differences in mortality were detected in both cohorts. Repeated long-term follow-up studies on geographically defined very preterm infant cohorts are needed for establishing reliable outcome data of current perinatal care.

40|$|Background Increasingly more First Nations (FN) {{people have}} moved from rural to urban areas. It is unknown how disparities in infant {{mortality}} among FN versus non-FN women have changed over time in urban versus rural areas. Methods We conducted a birth cohort-based study of all 877 925 live births (56 771 FN and 821 154 non-FN) registered in British Columbia, 1981 – 2000. Main outcomes included rates, risk differences, and relative risks of neonatal, postneonatal, and overall infant death. Results Both neonatal and <b>postneonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> for FN infants showed a steady decline in rural areas but a rise-and-fall pattern in urban areas. Relative risks for overall infant death among FN versus non-FN infants declined steadily from 2. 75 (95 % CI: 2. 04, 3. 72) to 1. 87 (95 % CI: 1. 24, 2. 81) in rural areas from 1981 – 1984 to 1997 – 2000, but rose from 1. 59 (95 % CI: 1. 27, 1. 99) (1981 – 1984) to 2. 80 (2. 33 – 3. 37) (1989 – 92) and then fell to 1. 89 (1. 44 – 2. 49) (1997 – 2000) in urban areas. Risk differences for neonatal death among FN versus non-FN infants declined substantially over time in rural but not urban areas. The disparities in neonatal death among FN versus non-FN were largely explained by differences in preterm birth, while the disparities in postneonatal death were not explained by observed maternal and pregnancy characteristics. Conclusions Reductions in disparities in infant mortality among FN versus non-FN women have been less substantial and consistent over time in urban versus rural areas of British Columbia, suggesting the need for greater attention to FN maternal and infant health in urban areas...|$|R
