40|$|Understanding {{the spatial}} {{distribution}} {{and intensity of}} fishing activity {{is a prerequisite for}} estimating fishing impacts on seabed biota and habitats. Vessel monitoring system data provide information on fishing activity at large spatial scales. However, successive <b>position</b> <b>records</b> can be too infrequent to describe the complex movements fishing vessels make. High-frequency position data were collected to evaluate how polling frequency and the method of analysis influenced the estimates of fishing impact on the seabed and associated epifaunal communities. Comparisons of known positions with predictions from track interpolation revealed that the performance of interpolation depended on fleet behaviour. Descriptions and indicators of fishing intensity were influenced significantly by the analytical methods (track reconstruction, density of <b>position</b> <b>records)</b> and grid-cell resolution used for the analysis. These factors can lead to an underestimation of fishing impact on epifaunal communities. It is necessary to correct for such errors to quantify the effects of fishing on various ecosystem components and hence to inform ecosystem-based management. Polling at intervals of 30 min would provide a desirable compromise between achieving precise estimates of fishing impacts on the seabed and minimizing the cost of data collection and handling...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA visual analytics process to detect encounters between vessels from ship position data is developed in this thesis. An archive of historical <b>position</b> <b>records</b> is pre-processed and filtered to provide input for an encounter detection algorithm. The algorithm arranges the <b>position</b> <b>records</b> into {{a set of}} sorted lists (SSL) so that only a minimum number of records need to be compared. The algorithm performs a single sweep over the record set to arrange it into a SSL and simultaneously find the encounters. To avoid problems due to discrete sampling, an interpolation of the data is performed when the sampling is too sparse. To accommodate large data sets, a divide-and-conquer approach using a sliding spatial window is developed. In post-processing, the elementary encounters are grouped into composite encounters by collecting elementary encounters occurring between the same vessels. Additionally, the composite encounters are input into a visual analytics tool where each composite encounter is represented as a layer on a map. Patterns of life analysis and investigations of potential anomalous activity are performed by zooming in on encounter areas of interest. The development of a visual analytics process to identify vessels of interest is the significant result of this thesis...|$|E

A {{simple and}} {{inexpensive}} method for recording vertical {{movements of the}} human mandible relative to the maxilla is presented.

40|$|M. A. Information plays a very {{significant}} role in the economic development of the enterprises. It is increasingly used as a corporate resource to improve productivity, efficiency and effectiveness. This means that information in the form of records, is a strategic weapon to gain competitive advantage for the enterprise that creates and receives them. The study explores the problems that are facing terminology in the study of information management and records management. The problems that exist in terms of terminology are so intense that there is yet no universally acceptable definition for records and records management. The basic elements of records management are explored in attempt to <b>position</b> <b>records</b> management as an information management function. It demands records as vital information resources be managed throughout their life cycles, at a strategic level {{in much the same way}} as other economic resources such as people, money and land. In managing records effectively, the education and training of records managers is regarded as imperative. In order to test the information management function of records management, a survey is administered within Enterprise ABC to observe the records management practices amongst the records staff. The findings of the survey reveal that the records management practices within Enterprise ABC are chaotic in the sense that there are no standards and procedures that govern the flow of records within the enterprise...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We {{describe}} {{new methods}} for quantifying specific in-situ activities of wildlife, {{in this case}} the endangered Cali-fornia condor (Gymnogyps californianus). These methods extract information from hundreds of thousands of temporally continuous and spatially explicit satellite telemetry reports. Visual observations and ground-based telemetry can provide behavioral data, although the information is often spatially and temporally limited and sample sizes can be small for wide-ranging species. Automated satellite telemetry offers continuous position reporting and unbiased spatial coverage, but to date has lacked thematic content such as the time, place, and duration of particular activities. Procedures developed for this study use a combination of models and geographic information systems (GIS) to identify condor transit flight, perch-ing, roosting, and nesting activity based only on hourly telemetry position reports. This approach combines the temporal and spatial advantages of automated telemetry with increased thematic quality from activity models. The analytical meth-ods were applied to 340, 694 satellite-based <b>position</b> <b>records</b> from 51 California condors which were collected from June 2005 to April 2012. We identified 31, 268 extended perch locations and an additional 15, 483 overnight roost locations by translating basic location, speed, and time data into characterizations of bird activities.
