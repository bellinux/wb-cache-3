In addition, trading activities are not free. Stock speculators/investors face several costs such as commissions, taxes and fees to be paid for the brokerage and other services, like the buying/selling orders placed at the stock exchange. Depending on the nature of each national or state legislation involved, a large array of fiscal obligations must be respected, and taxes are charged by jurisdictions over those transactions, dividends and capital gains that fall within their scope. However, these fiscal obligations will vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Among other reasons, there could be some instances where taxation is already incorporated into the stock price through the differing legislation that companies have to comply with in their respective jurisdictions; or that tax free stock market operations are useful to boost economic growth. Beyond these costs are the opportunity costs of money and time, currency risk, financial risk, and Internet, data and news agency services and electricity consumption expenses—all of which must be accounted for.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies four trading {{algorithms}} of a <b>professional</b> <b>trader</b> at {{a multilateral}} trading facility, observing a realistic two-sided limit order book whose dynamics {{are driven by}} the order book events. The identity of the trader can be either internalizing or regular, either a hedge fund or a brokery agency. The speed and cost of trading can be balanced by properly choosing active strategies on the displayed orders {{in the book and}} passive strategies on the hidden orders within the spread. We shall show that the price switching algorithms provide lower and upper bounds of the mixed trading algorithms. Especially, when the internalization premium is zero, an internalizing trader's optimal mixed trading strategy can be achieved among the set of price switching strategies. For both an internalizing trader and a regular trader, the optimal price switching strategy exists and is expressed in terms of the value function. A parallelizable algorithm to numerically compute the value function and optimal price switching strategy for the discretized state process is provided. Comment: 40 pages; 7 figures; 1 tabl...|$|E
40|$|The Efficient Market Hypothesis, {{which has}} been one of the {{fundamental}} propositions of finance for over 30 years, implies that an investor, whether he is an amateur or a <b>professional</b> <b>trader,</b> cannot consistently beat the market. In this study, we examine if this theory holds in the period preceding an earnings announcement, by testing whether there is a relationship between stock returns before and after an earnings announcement. We find that there exists a negative correlation between pre-earnings returns and post-earnings returns for small capitalization stocks that could be explained by investor irrationality. This relationship is statistically significant for pre-earnings returns calculated up to a 10 day period preceding an earnings announcement and strongest over a 3 day period. We also tested to see if there was a correlation between the earnings results in the last quarter and the movements in stock price prior to this quarter's earnings announcement, and did not observe any statistically significant outcomes. by Alika M.
