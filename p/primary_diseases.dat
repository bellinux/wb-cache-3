2500|$|The spleen {{is located}} in the left cranial abdomen and is held loosely in place by ligaments. <b>Primary</b> <b>diseases</b> of the spleen are splenic torsion and splenic tumors. Splenic torsion occurs when the spleen twists along the axis of the blood supply. Symptoms of splenic torsion include lethargy, {{abdominal}} distension and pale mucous membranes. One theory for the development of splenic torsion is that for dogs with chronic intermittent gastric dilatation, the dilation causes the spleen's ligaments to stretch and increases the spleen’s mobility within the abdomen. The spleen becomes torsed because it is no longer anchored in its correct location. In a normal Greater Swiss Mountain Dog the spleen is smooth and uncreased; it is about [...] by , and less than [...] thick. Most of the spleens removed from Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs are [...] by [...] and very thick. This size spleen is not an abnormal finding in this breed. It seems apparent that many dogs of the breed suffer enlarged spleens for no obvious reason other than the spleen may have been constantly twisting, folding and unfolding.|$|E

50|$|Cancer, a {{group of}} {{diseases}} in which cells grow and divide abnormally, is one of the <b>primary</b> <b>diseases</b> being looked at with regards to how it responds to CNT drug delivery. Current cancer therapy primarily involves surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. These methods of treatment are usually painful and kill normal cells in addition to producing adverse side effects. CNTs as drug delivery vehicles have shown potential in targeting specific cancer cells with a dosage lower than conventional drugs used, that is just as effective in killing the cells, however does not harm healthy cells and significantly reduces side effects. Current blood glucose monitoring methods by patients suffering from diabetes are normally invasive and often painful. For example, one method involves a continuous glucose sensor integrated into a small needle which must be inserted under the skin to monitor glucose levels every few days. Another method involves glucose monitoring strips to which blood must be applied. These methods are not only invasive but they can also yield inaccurate results. It was shown that 70 percent of glucose readings obtained by continuous glucose sensors differed by 10 percent or more and 7 percent differed by over 50 percent. The high electrochemically accessible surface area, high electrical conductivity and useful structural properties have demonstrated the potential use of single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) and multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs) in highly sensitive noninvasive glucose detectors.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{find out}} the most common <b>primary</b> <b>diseases</b> of drug-induced keratoconjunctivitis. METHODS: The {{clinical}} records of 18 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of drug-induced keratoconjunctivitis were retrospectively reviewed. <b>Primary</b> <b>diseases,</b> categories of induced-drugs, numbers of daily drops, characteristics of keratoconjunctivitis, treatment, epithelization period, and un-corrected visual acuity(UCVA) were studied. Data were analyzed by SPSS 18. 0. P RESULTS: <b>Primary</b> <b>diseases</b> included glaucoma(n = 6), herpes simplex keratitis(n = 6; two patients were post-surgery of cataract), herpes zoster keratitis(n = 1), keratitis after corneal foreign body taken(n = 1) and keratitis/corneal ulcer with unknown etiology(n = 4). Mean number of drugs was 3. 3 ± 1. 5 and the frequency was 9 ± 3. 9 times a day. Keratopathy was found in 16 cases, while conjunctival changes were found only in 3 cases(One patient got corneal and conjunctival changes simultaneously). Withdrawing the drugs, preservative-free lubricants or autologous serum, and topical low dose steroid drops were used for treatment. After a mean period of 7 ± 2. 8 d, symptoms began to relieve. The mean epithelization period was 21 ± 8. 8 d. Mean pretreatment and post-treatment UCVA was 0. 15 ± 0. 13 and 0. 43 ± 0. 27, respectively(P = 0. 003).

40|$|AIM: <b>Primary</b> <b>diseases</b> for {{malignant}} distal biliary strictures vary,and many metallic biliary stent {{types are}} marketed. This studyaimed to investigate factors, including axial force (AF), which affectpatency periods of metallic biliary stents placed for malignant distalbiliary strictures according to <b>primary</b> <b>diseases.</b> METHODS: This retrospective study involved 198 patients (114 with pancreatic head carcinoma, 53 with bile duct carcinoma, 24 withmetastasis, and 7 with papillary carcinoma) who underwent metallicbiliary stent placement for unresectable malignant distal biliarystrictures at our department and 2 neighboring institutions betweenJanuary 2001 and February 2011. RESULTS: Employing multivariate analysis, diseases and stenttypes were extracted as factors affecting stent patency periods. Therewere {{no significant differences}} among stent types in biliary stricturesdue to pancreatic head carcinoma and lymph node metastasis. For bile duct carcinoma, stent patency periods and AF correlatedpositively (correlation coefficient, 0. 92). Stent non-occlusion periodsassociated with food impaction as a cause for occlusion showed apositive correlation with AF (correlation coefficient, 0. 89). CONCLUSIONS: For unresectable distal bile duct carcinoma,metallic stents with high AF may prevent stent occlusion due to foodimpaction and prolong stent patency periods...|$|E
