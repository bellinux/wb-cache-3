40|$|Detecting left-channel targets {{interfered}} {{less with}} the shadowing of right-channel prose when {{performance of the}} former task was posthypnotically dissociated from consciousness. However, this superiority over an ordinary divided-attention condition was not, strictly speaking, due to unconscious target detection by the posthypnotic subjects. Rather, the suggestions for <b>posthypnotic</b> responsiveness with <b>amnesia</b> apparently engendered a passive mode {{of attention to the}} leftchannel task, such that subjects did not actively listen for targets in order to hear them. In a second experiment, explicit instructions to adopt a strategy of attentional passivity to the target-detection task proved to be a far more direct and effective way of producing the reduced-interference effect than the posthypnotic suggestions had been. The posthypnotic suggestions seemed to induce attentional passivity as an indirect effect of <b>amnesia</b> for the <b>posthypnotic</b> suggestions and for previously detected targets. The findings of both experiments are interpreted in terms of Hilgard's neodissociation theory. Classic dissociation theory (Janet, 1901) proposed the functional independence of two simultaneously performed tasks when one of the tasks was enacted unconsciously. Thus, if a secondary task is executed without awareness, performance of the primary task should be at the same level of proficiency as when it is performed by itself (Hull, 1933). Unfortunately for this classic dissociation theory, the empirical evidence does not support this functional independence hypothesis. In studies reviewed first by Hull (1933, chap. 7) and more recently by Hilgard (1977 a, chap. 7), quite the opposite was found (see also White & Shevach, 1942). That is, when appropriate hypnotic suggestions were used to keep a secondary task out Early phases of this investigation were supported b...|$|R

50|$|Theodore X. Barber argued however that {{techniques}} of hypnotic induction were merely empty but popularly expected rituals, inessential for hypnosis to occur: hypnosis on {{this view is}} a process of influence, which is only enhanced (or formalized) through expected cultural rituals. Oliver Zangwill pointed out in opposition that, while cultural expectations are important in hypnotic induction, seeing hypnosis only as a conscious process of influence fails to account for such phenomena as <b>posthypnotic</b> <b>amnesia</b> or post-hypnotic suggestion. Evidence of changes in brain activity and mental processes have also been associated experimentally with hypnotic inductions.|$|E

40|$|The {{breakdown}} of amnesia was examined by showing subjects {{a videotape of}} the hypnotic events that they had experienced. The extent of the amnesia for these events was defined precisely, and simulating procedures were employed to analyze the cues existing in the overall test situation. Videotape display of the hypnotic events was presented via application of the Experiential Analysis Technique and served to optimize conditions for breakdown. Results demonstrated that some hypnotic subjects ' amnesia cannot be broken down {{even when they are}} exposed via videotape playback to the events to be recalled and when suggestions for the period of amnesia are quite explicit. Simulators showed breaching of amnesia but attributed their recall to the videotape rather than to the hypnotic session. Hypnotic subjects were distinctive in their inability to recall experiential aspects of their performance even though they could recall behavioral aspects. Alternative interpretations of the data are discussed in relation to the hypothesis that dissociative cognitive mechanisms underlie <b>posthypnotic</b> <b>amnesia.</b> <b>Posthypnotic</b> <b>amnesia</b> refers to subjects' apparent inability to recall hypnotic events following a suggestion that they will not remember those events when awakened from hypnosis.

40|$|Memory for {{successful}} and unsuccessful responses to hypnotic suggestions was evaluated in partially amnesic subjects {{and in those}} subjects with normal forgetting. Two analyses (N = 278) demonstrated that highly hypnotizable subjects experiencing partial <b>posthypnotic</b> <b>amnesia</b> tended to show no selective recall for their successes or failures during amnesia, whereas {{the remainder of the}} subjects showed definite selective recall of hypnotic success posthypnotically. These findings lend support to the hypothesis put forth by Evans and Kihlstrom that <b>posthypnotic</b> <b>amnesia</b> involves a disruption of memory organization and suggests that the phenomenon may be mediated by a restriction in the use of normally employed retrieval cues.

40|$|Although forgetting {{is often}} {{regarded}} as a deficit {{that we need to}} control to optimize cognitive functioning, it can have beneficial effects in a number of contexts. We examined whether disrupting memory for previous numerical responses would attenuate repetition avoidance (the tendency to avoid repeating the same number) during random number generation and thereby improve the randomness of responses. Low suggestible and low dissociative and high dissociative highly suggestible individuals completed a random number generation task in a control condition, following a <b>posthypnotic</b> <b>amnesia</b> suggestion to forget previous numerical responses, and in a second control condition following the cancellation of the suggestion. High dissociative highly suggestible participants displayed a selective increase in repetitions during <b>posthypnotic</b> <b>amnesia,</b> with equivalent repetition frequency to a random system, whereas the other two groups exhibited repetition avoidance across conditions.

40|$|In {{a series}} of studies using the susceptibility-scale paradigm, high {{susceptible}} subjects were less likely than low susceptibles to recall the events of the hypnotic session in temporal sequence (i. e., temporal disorganization effect) following an amnesia suggestion. The primary measure of recall order was the rank-order correlation (rho scores) between the presentation order and the recall order of hypnotic experiences computed for each subject. Following a suggestion for <b>posthypnotic</b> <b>amnesia,</b> high susceptibles usually obtained lower rho scores than low susceptibles. We critically examined this research noting methodological shortcomings associated with the susceptibility-scale paradigm, inconsistent findings, and failures to replicate. We also presented two studies that found no relationship between susceptibility level and rho scores. These null results held true for subjects who recalled new information after cancellation of the amnesia suggestion (reversers) as well as for those who did not recall new information (nonreversers). Nevertheless, we did replicate previous work on differential recall of the first item. Suggestions {{for the development of a}} more adequate paradigm to assess recall order during amnesia using the susceptibility-scale paradigm are discussed. In 1973, Evans and Kihlstrom published the first in an influential series of articles on the organization of recall during <b>posthypnotic</b> <b>amnesia</b> (Evans & Kihlstrom, 1973; Kihlstrom, 1975; Kihlstrom & Evans, 1979).

Whether it is related to the personality disorder functioning styles remains unanswered. Methods In 77 patients with personality disorders and 154 healthy volunteers, we administered the Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scale: Form C (SHSSC) and the Parker Personality Measure (PERM) tests. Results Patients with personality disorders showed higher passing rates on SHSSC Dream and <b>Posthypnotic</b> <b>Amnesia</b> items. No significant correlation was found in healthy volunteers. In the patients however, SHSSC Taste hallucination (β = 0. 26) and Anosmia to Ammonia (β = - 0. 23) were significantly correlated with the PERM Borderline style; SHSSC <b>Posthypnotic</b> <b>Amnesia</b> was correlated with the PERM Schizoid style (β = 0. 25) but negatively the PERM Narcissistic style (β = - 0. 23).

40|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>posthypnotic</b> <b>amnesia</b> and cognitive efficiency among schizophrenic Ss was explored {{by analyzing the}} occurrence of reversible, nonreversible, and fail amnesia {{in a sample of}} 54 schizophrenic Ss who were additionally classifed reliably for the phases of awareness experienced by them at the time of assessment. Cognitive efficiency was measured in the waking state predominantly by the application of tests of memory function, and the Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scale, Form A (SHSS:A) of Weitzenhoffer and Hilgard (1959) was adopted to measure Ss’ level of hypnotizability, results being analyzed in detail for SHSS:A 2 ̆ 7 s amnesia item. Data demonstrated that Ss’ phase of awareness was related to Ss’ overall level of susceptibility and that low cognitive efficiency and poor memory function were directly related to nonreversible amnesia, but that especially poor waking memory was not involved in the development of <b>posthypnotic</b> <b>amnesia</b> in the schizophrenic population. Results for Ss’ phases of awareness that reflected their differing levels of contact with social reality yielded anomalies in the data which suggested that the amnesia task on SHSS:A does not provide optimal conditions of assessment for the measurement of amnesia in schizophrenic Ss...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} {{has led some}} investigators to hypothesize that <b>posthypnotic</b> <b>amnesia</b> {{is characterized by a}} disruption in the memory search process and, more generally, by disorganization in memory retrieval. Data to test these hypotheses were provided by 141 male and female undergraduates administered the Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scales, Forms B and C. Amnesia was assessed by the usual recall criterion and by a batch recognition-testing procedure. The disruptedsearch hypothesis, tested by comparing the effects of the amnesia suggestion on recall and recognition, was not supported. The use of recognition items, rank ordered by subjects according to their judgment of order of administration, furnished data to test the memory disorganization hypothesis. In support of this hypothesis, analyses of the temporal rankings of recognized items revealed greater disorganization in the memory of subjects who were initially amnesic by recall criteria than those who were partially amnesic or nonamnesic. Nevertheless, a number of other findings, including the fact that fewer than 50 % of the initially amnesic subjects showed disorganized recognition and that the disorganization effect during recall was weak and inconsistent, call into question the explanatory power of this hypothesis. Recent research in <b>posthypnotic</b> <b>amnesia</b> has sought to identify its underlying processes. Much of this work has been done b...|$|E
40|$|Hypnotized {{subjects}} {{respond to}} suggestions from the hypnotist for imaginative experiences involving alterations in perception and memory. Individual differences in hypnotizability are only weakly related to {{other forms of}} suggestibility. Neuropsychological speculations about hypnosis focus on the right hemisphere and/or the frontal lobes. <b>Posthypnotic</b> <b>amnesia</b> refers to subjects' difficulty in remembering, after hypnosis, the events and experiences that transpired while they were hypnotized. <b>Posthypnotic</b> <b>amnesia</b> is not an instance of state-dependent memory, but it does seem to involve a disruption of retrieval processes similar to the functional amnesias observed in clinical dissociative disorders. Implicit memory, however, is largely spared, and may underlie subjects' ability to recognize events that they cannot recall. Hypnotic hypermnesia refers to improved memory for past events. However, such improvements are illusory: hypermnesia suggestions increase false recollection, as well as subjects' confidence in both true and false memories. Hypnotic age regression can be subjectively compelling, but does not involve the ablation of adult memory, or the reinstatement of childlike modes of mental functioning, or the revivification of memory. The clinical and forensic use of hypermnesia and age regression to enhance memory in patients, victims and witnesses (e. g. recovered memory therapy for child sexual abuse) should be discouraged...|$|E

On {{the basis of the}} review and these experiments, an information-processing model is constructed that emphasizes the inhibition of verbal output as the central process. According to this model, hypnotically susceptible subjects fail to report ???forbidden??? material because it has been tagged as ???forbidden??? in response to the hypnotic suggestion for forgetting.

40|$|High {{hypnotic}} suggestibility is {{a heterogeneous}} condition {{and there is}} accumulating evidence that highly suggestible individuals may be comprised of discrete subtypes with dissimilar cognitive and phenomenological profiles.

Comparisons among models indicated that a four-class model was optimal. One class was comprised of very highly suggestible (virtuoso) participants, two classes included highly suggestible participants who were alternately more responsive to inhibitory cognitive suggestions or <b>posthypnotic</b> <b>amnesia</b> suggestions, and the fourth class consisted primarily of medium suggestible participants. These results indicate that there are discrete response profiles in high hypnotic suggestibility.

40|$|SummaryTwo {{groups of}} participants, one {{susceptible}} to <b>posthypnotic</b> <b>amnesia</b> (PHA) {{and the other}} not, viewed a movie. A week later, they underwent hypnosis in the fMRI scanner and received a suggestion to forget the movie details after hypnosis until receiving a reversal cue. The participants were tested twice for memory for the movie and for {{the context in which}} it was shown, under the posthypnotic suggestion and after its reversal, while their brain was scanned. The PHA group showed reduced memory for movie but not for context while under suggestion. Activity in occipital, temporal, and prefrontal areas differed among the groups, and, in the PHA group, between suggestion and reversal conditions. We propose that whereas some of these regions subserve retrieval of long-term episodic memory, others are involved in inhibiting retrieval, possibly already in a preretrieval monitoring stage. Similar mechanisms may also underlie other forms of functional amnesia...|$|E
40|$|Certain {{reliable}} {{findings from}} research on directed forgetting seem difficult to accommodate {{in terms of}} the theoretical processes, such as selective rehearsal or storage differentiation, that have been put forward to account for directed-for-x getting phenomena. Some kind of "missing mechanism " appears to be involved. In order to circumvent the methodological constraints that have limited the con-clusions investigators could draw from past experiments, a new paradigm is in-troduced herein that includes a mixture of intentional and incidental learning. With this paradigm, a midlist instruction to forget the first half of a list was found to reduce later recall of the items learned incidentally as well as those learned intentionally. This result suggests that a cue to forget can lead to a disruption of retrieval processes {{as well as to the}} alteration of encoding processes postulated in prior theories. The results also provide a link between intentional forgetting and the literature on <b>posthypnotic</b> <b>amnesia,</b> in which disrupted retrieval has been implicated.

40|$|Resting state fMRI (functional {{magnetic}} resonance imaging) acquisitions {{are characterized by}} low-frequency spontaneous activity in a default mode network (encompassing medial brain areas and linked to self-related processes) and an anticorrelated “extrinsic” system (encompassing lateral frontoparietal areas and modulated via external sensory stimulation). In order to better determine the functional contribution of these networks to conscious awareness, we here sought to transiently modulate their relationship by means of hypnosis. We used independent component analysis (ICA) on resting state fMRI acquisitions during normal wakefulness, under hypnotic state, and during a control condition of autobiographical mental imagery. As compared to mental imagery, hypnosis-induced modulation of resting state fMRI networks resulted in a reduced “extrinsic” lateral frontoparietal cortical connectivity, possibly reflecting a decreased sensory awareness. The default mode network showed an increased connectivity in bilateral angular and middle frontal gyri, whereas its posterior midline and parahippocampal structures decreased their connectivity during hypnosis, supposedly related to an altered “self” awareness and <b>posthypnotic</b> <b>amnesia.</b> In our view, fMRI resting state studies of physiological (e. g., sleep or hypnosis), pharmacological (e. g., sedation or anesthesia), and pathological modulation (e. g., coma or related states) of “intrinsic” default mode and anticorrelated “extrinsic” sensory networks, and their interaction with other cerebral networks, will further improve {{our understanding of the}} neural correlates of subjective awareness.

40|$|The Harvard Group Scale of Hypnotic Susceptibility (HGSHS:A) {{has proven}} to be a {{reliable}} and efficient measure of hypnotizability (Siuta, 2010). However, the psychometric properties of the <b>posthypnotic</b> <b>amnesia</b> suggestion on this scale lack integrity (Sadler & Woody, 2004; Piesbergen & Peter, 2006). It is hypothesized that the ambiguously written instructions explaining the recall test to participants are obscuring measurement, resulting in non-amnesic participants being scored amnesic. To show participants can be scored amnesic for reasons not attributable to the suggestion, 81 participants were administered the HGSHS:A without the amnesia suggestion. No difference in amnesia pass rate was observed between this group compared to 78 participants administered the standard HGSHS:A. Modifying the instructions to more directly explain the task to participants significantly lowered the frequency of passing this suggestion. In addition, no lows were scored amnesic and the concordance between behavioural and subjective scores was improved with the new instructions. Retesting the modified instructions on participants not administered the amnesia suggestion (N = 65) resulted in participants nevertheless being scored amnesic. The results from this study indicate that 1) the HGSHS:A scoring is improperly classifying participants as amnesic 2) the modified instructions better capture the classic suggestion effect 3) a significant proportion of participants experience difficulty remembering the hypnotic suggestions post-session, regardless of whether a suggestion for amnesia is administered.

We have hypothesized that the correlation exists but varies in individuals with different levels of hypnotizability. Participants and methods: We invited 72 individuals with high (HIGH group) and 47 individuals with low (LOW group) hypnotic susceptibilities to undertake tests of NEO-PI-R and the Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scale, Form C (SHSSC). Results: The HIGH group {{scored significantly higher than}} the LOW group did on openness to experience and its facet openness to feelings. In the LOW group, SHSSC total was positively predicted by openness to ideas; age regression was positively predicted by openness to experience and negatively predicted by extraversion; anosmia to ammonia was negatively predicted by agreeableness; and negative visual hallucination was positively predicted by openness to experience. In the HIGH group, hallucinated voice was positively predicted by openness to experience and negatively predicted by agreeableness, and <b>posthypnotic</b> <b>amnesia</b> was positively predicted by extraversion and negatively predicted by openness to experience. Conclusion: The associations between normal personality traits and hypnotic susceptibility items were weak and different in the two groups, which imply that managing mental or somatoform disorders might be through adjusting hypnotizability and mobilizing personality functions.

40|$|ONE of {{the basic}} tenets of {{psychosomatic}} medi-cine is that long continued emotional stress can produce widespread somatic changes. Prob-ably'the most insidious form of emotional stress is that which issues from unconscious conflict, since the individual, unaware of {{the cause of his}} diffi-culty, is usually helpless in coping with it. That unconscious conflict can produce psycho-somatic illness is confirmed by studies during psy-choanalytic therapy. However, few experimental studies have been made reporting on this phenome-non. It is understandable why this is so, since in a field as complex as human behavior it is ex-tremely difficult to provide satisfactory experimental conditions. Following the important observations of Luria (5), other workers (1 - 4, 6) have demonstrated how hypnosis. may be utilized to study the effects of an experimentally induced conflict on the indi-vidual. Where <b>posthypnotic</b> <b>amnesia</b> is suggested or where it occurs spontaneously, the subject, while {{under the influence of the}} conflict, is not consciously aware of its existence. This paper deals with experiences under hypnosis which demonstrate in a more or less dramatic fashion how unconscious conflict can produce states of somatic distress. Some of the effects reported are the deliberate product of an artificially induced conflict, while others are accidental by-products of conflicts inadvertently created during hypnoanalytic therapy. The first case demonstrates how a conflict be-tween an irrepressible impulse and a moral prohibi-tion reflects itself in a generalized state of tension, with muscular tremors and neurocirculatory col-lapse. The subject was an individual who claimed he had no disturbing neurotic difficulties and had volunteered to act as a subject out of interest. An experimental conflict was induced in a deep trance by giving the subject the following posthypnotic suggestion. "When you awaken you will find next to you a bar of chocolate.
