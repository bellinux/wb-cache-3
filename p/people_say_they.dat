5|$|Marsden reappears on Albert Square in 2009 when Archie Mitchell (Larry Lamb) is murdered. She {{arrives on}} the scene when several <b>people</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> suspect Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks), but Marsden waits before {{questioning}} her, and questions the Mitchells first. She makes a televised appeal for witnesses and later interviews Phil, but he is provided an alibi by his girlfriend Shirley Carter (Linda Henry). A few days later, a red fingernail is found {{at the scene of}} the murder; Marsden visits the female locals, checking their hands. Seeing an upset Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison), knowing that she is vulnerable and lives with Shirley, she talks to Heather about Christmas Day and Heather accidentally tells Marsden that Phil wasn't there. Marsden interviews Phil and later visits his home, asking to see the clothes he was wearing on Christmas Day. Shirley shows her a clean shirt; Marsden closes the laundrette, hoping anyone with blood-stained clothes will not be able to wash them. After a tip-off Marsden arrests Sam Mitchell (Danniella Westbrook); Sam accuses her mother, Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor), of the murder. Marsden confirms that she was there to talk to Peggy, questioning Peggy and Sam at the police station. Peggy is released without charge; however, Sam is detained for jumping bail. Marsden visits Janine, who insists that people will say anything to get her in trouble. She asks Janine why she was out in the cold on Christmas Day, and asks if Janine knows where Archie's laptop as it had gone missing.|$|E
500|$|Scott Boras has {{represented}} Holliday as his agent since he turned professional. [...] Holliday described {{his relationship with}} Boras and his staff in that he [...] "enjoy(s) sitting down and talking to them. [...] Scott is as accessible as {{you want him to}} be. [...] I could call him right now. He's got a lot of clients and <b>people</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> don’t hear from Scott but he’ll give you as much or as little attention as you want." [...] Holliday further explained that due to the amenities the Boras Corporation provides, including a staff psychologist, research to assist players in prolonging careers, studies into arbitration cases, and statistical performance computation, he felt that Boras' agency gave him the best opportunities to succeed.|$|E
500|$|Alcatraz {{has been}} cited {{as one of the}} most [...] "haunted" [...] places in America. The Native Americans {{mentioned}} the evil spirits they purportedly encountered on the island long before it became a military prison. Mark Twain visited it, found the atmosphere of the island eerie, and described it as [...] "being as cold as winter, even in the summer months", and The Washington Post has also claimed that Alcatraz is a place [...] "where visitors can sense the dread of past inhabitants still trapped in the atmosphere." [...] The alleged haunting of the prison has been documented in numerous paranormal television series. Officials for Alcatraz have dismissed the reports of ghosts at Alcatraz as nonsense and deny their existence; an official for Alcatraz said in 1994, [...] "These ridiculous ghost stories will stop tourists from visiting. And how can these <b>people</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> heard canaries? We don't have any birds in here." ...|$|E

[...] Suburban councillors Gloria Lindsay Luby and Doug Holyday came out opposed while inner-city councillor Kyle Rae fought for the proposal. Mayor David Miller did not favour the proposal either, stating that there were other, higher priorities. The proposal {{did not come to}} Council for discussion and vote.|$|E

And I think if <b>people</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> hear the voice of God all the time and say they know what to do, then impose that on you, politically, it is theological tyranny. Whereas if you have doubt, it stops you from abusing your religious belief. Religion can be so abused in the interests of power, especially on behalf of institutions and governments." ...|$|E
2500|$|Being very {{detached}} from the Hollywood scene, Murray {{does not have an}} agent or manager and reportedly only fields offers for scripts and roles using a personal telephone number with a voice mailbox that he checks infrequently. This practice has the downside of sometimes preventing him from taking parts in films such as Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Monsters, Inc., The Squid and the Whale, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and Little Miss Sunshine. [...] When asked about this practice, however, Murray seemed content with his inaccessibility, stating, [...] "It's not that hard. If you have a good script that's what gets you involved. <b>People</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> can't find me. Well, if you can write a good script, that's a lot harder than finding someone. I don't worry about it; it's not my problem." ...|$|E

She further said Barghouti also denied a right to self-determination of the Jewish <b>people,</b> <b>saying</b> <b>they</b> are not a people and denying they have any collective rights.|$|R

2500|$|From October 5–7, 2006, the Ressikan flute {{was one of}} {{the items}} up for bid at the Christie's {{official}} studio auction of Star Trek memorabilia. The prop flute, which cannot actually be played, was originally estimated to have a sale price of US$300. Auction directors admitted that their estimates for many items did not [...] "factor in that emotional fury generated around this kind of material". The estimate was later raised to $800–$1,200 on Christie's web site. In {{the days leading up to}} the auction, Denise Okuda, former Trek scenic artist and video supervisor, as well as co-writer of the auction catalog, said: [...] "That's the item <b>people</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> really have to have, because it's so iconic to a much-beloved episode." [...] The final bid for the flute at the auction was US$40,000. Including the additional 20% fee Christie's collected on all items from the winning bidder, the total price for the flute was $48,000.|$|E
2500|$|Anna (Elizabeth Lail) {{arrives at}} Rumplestiltskin's (Robert Carlyle) tower {{and talks to}} him about the {{disappearance}} of her parents. Rumplestiltskin offers to help if she puts the contents of a vial into the Apprentice's drink telling her that he is an evil man. Anna states that she will do [...] "whatever it takes" [...] to find out why her parents visited The Enchanted Forest and Rumplestiltskin comments that he loves when <b>people</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> will do whatever it takes. Anna goes to the man's house and after a brief conversation she has a chance to put the vial's contents into his tea but instead decides to throw them into the fire thinking that it is poison. Anna arrives back at Rumplestiltskin's tower and informs him that she gave the contents of the vial to the Apprentice. Mr. Gold says that is good because it is an antidote to a poison he was given yesterday. Anna, horrified by this, tells Rumplestiltskin the truth and says they must go back to the cottage. They look in Rumplestiltskin's crystal ball and see the man succumbing to the poison by turning into a mouse.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his book}} [...] (2005), Malcolm Gladwell relates his conversations with market {{researchers}} in the food industry who put most {{of the blame for}} the failure of New Coke on the flawed nature of taste tests. They claim most are subject to systematic biases. Tests such as the Pepsi Challenge were [...] "sip tests", meaning that drinkers were given small samples (less than a can or bottle's worth) to try. Gladwell contends that what <b>people</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> like in these tests may not reflect what they actually buy to drink at home over several days. Carol Dollard, who once worked in product development for Pepsi, told Gladwell: [...] "I've seen many times where the sip test will give you one result and the home-use test will give you the exact opposite." [...] For example, although many consumers react positively to the sweeter taste of Pepsi in small volumes, it may become unattractively sweet when drunk in quantity. Coke, on the other hand, may be more attractive for drinking in volume, because it is less sweet. A more comprehensive testing regimen could possibly have revealed this, Gladwell's sources believe.|$|E

2500|$|Horowitz taught seven {{students}} between 1937 and 1962: Nico Kaufmann (1937), Byron Janis (1944–1948), Gary Graffman (1953–1955), Coleman Blumfield (1956–1958), Ronald Turini (1957–1963), Alexander Fiorillo (1960–1962) and Ivan Davis (1961–1962). Janis {{described his}} relationship to Horowitz during that period as a surrogate son, and he often traveled with Horowitz and his wife during concert tours. Davis was invited {{to become one of}} Horowitz's students after receiving a call from him the day after he won the Franz Liszt Competition. At the time, Davis had a contract with Columbia Records and a national tour planned. Horowitz claimed that he had only taught three students during that period. [...] "Many young <b>people</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> have been pupils of Horowitz, but there were only three. Janis, Turini, who I brought to the stage, and Graffman. If someone else claims it, it's not true. I had some who played for me for four months. Once a week. I stopped work with them, because they did not progress." [...] According to biographer Glenn Plaskin, [...] "The fact that Horowitz disavowed most of his students and blurred the facts regarding their periods of study says something about the erratic nature of his personality during that period". Horowitz returned to coaching in the 1980s, working with Murray Perahia, who already had an established career, and Eduardus Halim.|$|E
2500|$|Despite former {{guards and}} park rangers {{revealing}} their paranormal experiences at Alcatraz, officials for Alcatraz have publicly dismissed {{the reports of}} ghosts at Alcatraz as nonsense and deny their existence; an official for Alcatraz said in 1994, [...] "These ridiculous ghost stories will stop tourists from visiting. And how can these <b>people</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> heard canaries? We don't have any birds in here." [...] Mary Forgione of the Los Angeles Times also stated that [...] "The National Park Service, which operates the island as a tourist site, pooh-poohs this, calling it Hollywood hype." [...] Alcatraz, run by the National Park Service, therefore does not operate an [...] "official ghost tour" [...] for tourists, but such tours, organized by independent parties, are permitted in the prison. Former prison guard Frank Healy, who served at Alcatraz {{as a young man}} from 1948 to 1951, has said that it was easy to gain a negative feeling at the prison {{at a time when it}} was all [...] "doom and gloom", although he said that if any place would have ghosts it would be Alcatraz. [...] Tracy Grant of The Washington Post, in discussing the book [...] "Ghost Hunt" [...] which documents the alleged haunting at Alcatraz, has said [...] "Authors Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson claim to be ghost hunters, and in this book they offer stories about the ghosts of inmates at Alcatraz prison and the idea that the ocean can be haunted. These stories are definitely scary, but don't take them too seriously. After all, ghosts aren't real. Are they?" ...|$|E
