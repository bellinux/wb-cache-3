40|$|In {{order to}} {{experimentally}} study the conditions leading to ice formation on aircraft surfaces, an aircraft {{was equipped with}} small auxiliary surfaces and aerodynamic shapes similar to struts, wires, <b>Pitot</b> <b>heads,</b> etc. This airplane was flown at an altitude where a temperature of 32 F was encountered, at such times as cloud formations could {{be found at the}} coincident altitude. Here it was discovered that ice formed rapidly in regard to quantity,character, shape, and rapidity of formation. An examination of this data, which confirms observations of pilots, indicates that the weight of ice collected can very possibly be sufficient to force the airplane to rapidly lose altitude on account of the increased loads. However, it is more evident that the malformation of the aerodynamic shapes may so increase the drag and reduce the lift so as to produce a loss of altitude even greater in consequence, the combination of the two working in the same direction having a double effect. Other adverse consequences are noted. The recommendation for the guidance of those who must encounter these conditions appears to lie entirely along the lines of avoidance...|$|R

40|$|Presently at IMD, wake {{created by}} ship hulls can be {{measured}} using the wake survey system. It provides a means of measuring the water flow of a ship hull, {{in order to determine}} the flow velocity and direction at the propeller plane. Currently, the measurements are done using a five-hole <b>pitot</b> tube probe <b>head,</b> containing pressure transducers. From this data, propellers can be designed for the different ship hulls at different conditions. Before performing wake survey, preliminary steps have to be taken.

40|$|A {{study of}} the design and {{operating}} characteristics of free-jet water tunnels is presented. Included is a brief analysis indicating {{that this type of}} water tunnel is particularly well suited for the empirical analysis of steady-state cavities which form about solid bodies moving through water at extremely low cavitation indices. It is pointed out that the conventional closed-jet and open-jet types possess inherent limitations {{on the quality of the}} test-section flow and the accuracy and applicability of the measurable flow properties at these low cavitation indices. The experimental apparatus is described verbally and photographically. It was designed for the production and study of a test jet of circular cross section having a 2 -in. diameter and an effective length of 6 diameters. The jet could be directed vertically upward, vertically downward, and horizontally. Facilities for the production and analysis of steady state cavities within the jet are also described. The experimental studies and the results are discussed. Included are observations concerning air entrainment by the jet, visual qualities of the jet, total <b>head</b> <b>Pitot</b> tube traverses of the jet, and steady~state cavities within the jet at cavitation indices as low as 0. 015. The report concludes with general recommendations concerning the design of free-jet water tunnels.

40|$|During {{the testing}} of {{development}} engines and components, intrusive instrumentation such as Kiel <b>head</b> <b>Pitot</b> probes and shrouded thermocouples are used to evaluate gas properties and performance. The size of these instruments can be significant relative to the blades {{and their impact on}} aerodynamic efficiency must be considered when analysing the test data. This paper reports on such parasitic losses for instruments mounted on the leading edge of a stator in a low pressure turbine, with particular emphasis on understanding the impact of probe geometry on the induced loss. The instrumentation and turbine blades were modeled in a low Mach number cascade facility with an upstream turbulence grid. The cascade was designed so that leading edge probes were interchangeable in-situ, allowing for rapid testing of differing probe geometries. RANS calculations were performed to complement the experiments and improve understanding of the flow behaviour. A horseshoe vortex-like system forms where the probe body joins the blade leading edge, generating pairs of streamwise vortices which convect over the blade pressure and suction surfaces. These vortices promote mixing between freestream and boundary layer fluid, and promote the transition of the boundary layer from laminar to turbulent flow. Tests with realistic probe geometries demonstrated that the design of the shroud bleed system can impact losses and a study using idealised cylinders was performed to isolate the impact of probe diameter, aspect ratio and incidence. Beyond a probe aspect ratio of two; parasitic loss was found to scale approximately with probe frontal area.

40|$|Signal Corps wind {{equipment}} AN/GMQ- 1 {{consisting of}} a 3 -cup anemometer and wind vane was calibrated for wind velocities from 1 to 200 miles per hour. Cup-shaft failure prevented calibration at higher wind velocities. The action of the wind vane was checked and found to have very poor directional accuracy below a velocity of 8 miles per hour. After shaft failure was reported to the Signal Corps, the cup rotors were redesigned by strengthening the shafts for better operation at high velocities. The anemometer with the redesigned cup rotors was recalibrated, but cup-shaft failure occurred again at a wind velocity of approximately 220 miles per hour.
