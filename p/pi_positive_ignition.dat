The required perfusion pressures needed for optimal HMP {{of the liver}} are, however, unknown. Rat livers were preserved in University of Wisconsin organ preservation solution enriched with acridine orange (AO) to stain viable cells and propidium iodide (PI) to detect dead cells. Perfusion pressures of 12. 5 %, 25 % or 50 % of physiologic perfusion pressures were compared. Intravital fluorescence microscopy {{was used to assess}} liver perfusion by measuring the percentage of AO staining. After 1 -h, the perfusion pressure of 12. 5 % revealed 72 % +/- 3 % perfusion of mainly the acinary zones one and two. The perfusion pressure of 25 % and 50 % showed complete perfusion. Furthermore, 12. 5 % showed 14. 7 +/- 3. 6, 25 % showed 3. 7 +/- 0. 9, and 50 % showed 11. 2 +/- 1. 4 <b>PI</b> <b>positive</b> cells.

In comparison with 24 -h cold-storage, HMP at 25 % showed less <b>PI</b> <b>positive</b> cells and HMP at 50 % showed more <b>PI</b> <b>positive</b> cells. In summary, perfusion at 25 % showed complete perfusion, demonstrated by AO staining, with minimal cellular injury, shown with PI.

CAM stained live cells, whereas PI stained dead cells. When double staining with CAM and PI was performed, three physiological states, i. e., live (calcein <b>positive,</b> <b>PI</b> negative), dead (calcein negative, <b>PI</b> <b>positive),</b> and permeabilized (calcein <b>positive,</b> <b>PI</b> <b>positive),</b> were detected. To evaluate the reliability of this double-staining method, suspensions of live and dead cells were mixed in various proportions and analyzed by FCM. The proportion of dead cells measured by FCM directly correlated with the proportion of dead cells in the sample (y = 0. 9872 x + 0. 18; R 2 = 0. 9971). In addition, the proportion of live cells measured by FCM inversely correlated with the proportion of dead cells in the sample (y = − 0. 9776 x + 98. 36; R 2 = 0. 9962). The proportion of permeabilized cells was consistently less than 2 %. These results indicate that FCM in combination with CAM and PI staining is rapid (≤ 1 h) and distinguishes correctly among live, dead, and permeabilized cells...|$|R

With deoxynivalenol (DON), T- 2 toxin (T- 2), fumonisin B 1 (FB 1) and zearalenone (ZEA) being important Fusarium toxins in the northern hemisphere, this study aimed to investigate in vitro the toxic effect of these mycotoxins on intestinal porcine epithelial cells derived from the jejunum (IPEC-J 2 cells). Viability of IPEC-J 2 cells {{as well as the}} proportion of apoptotic and necrotic IPEC-J 2 cells was determined by flow cytometry after 72 h of exposure to the toxins. Correlatively, the integrity of the intestinal epithelial cell monolayer was studied using Transwell® inserts, in which the trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and passage of the antibiotics doxycycline and paromomycin were used as endpoints. Results We demonstrated that the percentage of Annexin-V-FITC and PI negative (viable) cells, Annexin-V-FITC <b>positive</b> and <b>PI</b> negative (apoptotic) cells and Annexin-V-FITC and <b>PI</b> <b>positive</b> (necrotic) IPEC-J 2 cells showed a mycotoxin concentration-dependent relationship with T- 2 toxin being the most toxic. Moreover, the ratio between Annexin-V-FITC <b>positive</b> and <b>PI</b> negative cells and Annexin-V-FITC and <b>PI</b> <b>positive</b> cells varied {{depending on the type of}} toxin. More Annexin-V-FITC and <b>PI</b> <b>positive</b> cells could be found after treatment with T- 2 toxin, while more Annexin-V-FITC <b>positive</b> and <b>PI</b> negative cells were found after exposure to DON.

40|$|Abstract Background Interferon-α (IFN-α) exerts an {{anti-tumor effect}} {{at least through}} {{induction}} of apoptosis {{in a variety of}} types including B lymphoma cells. We recently found that IFN-α induced a sustained activation of c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase 1 (JNK 1), which is implicated in activation of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) promoter. In the present study, we explored upstream component(s) of the prolonged IFN-α-initiated activation of JNK 1. Results IFN-α caused activation of PKC-δ in Daudi B lymphoma cells and myeloma U 266 cells, as detected by Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody specific for the phosphorylated form of PKC-δ. The dominant-negative form of mutant PKC-δ (dnPKC-δ) reduced the IFN-α-induced JNK 1 activation, TRAIL promoter activity, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), and increase in propidium iodide (<b>PI)</b> <b>positive</b> cells. The IFN-α-induced activation of JNK 1 and the TRAIL promoter was also attenuated by the PKC-δ inhibitor rottlerin. Moreover, a constitutively active form of mutant PKC-δ enhanced the IFN-α-induced TRAIL promoter activity and loss of ΔΨm in Daudi B lymphoma cells. In addition, IFN-α-induced Ser 727 phosphorylation of Stat 1 was also abrogated by dnPKC-δ. Conclusions IFN-α induced JNK 1 activation via PKC-δ, leading to upregulation of TRAIL. The interaction of the consequent enhanced TRAIL expression with TRAIL-receptor results in a loss of ΔΨm and increase in <b>PI</b> <b>positive</b> cells.

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 142 - 170. Fumonisin B₁ (FB₁‚) is a {{carcinogenic}} mycotoxin {{produced by}} the fimgus Fusarium moniliforme in maize, and is hepatotoxic and hepatocarcinogenic in rats. The goal of this dissertation was to characterise the FB₁-fed rat {{as a model for}} liver injury and carcinogenesis, and to examine the role of oval ('progenitor') cells during these processes. Male Fischer 344 rats were fed FB₁ 250 mg/kg diet for five weeks, and this basic feeding regimen was modified in individual experiments. Short-term feeding of FB₁ caused a severe 'toxic' hepatitis, apoptosis and regeneration of hepatocytes, fibrosis, proliferation of OV- 6 positive oval cells, and formation of GST <b>pi</b> <b>positive</b> hepatic foci and nodules. Oval cells were noted inside some of the hepatic nodules. There were marked increases in the expression of mRNA transcripts for mature TGF-β 1 and c-myc in livers of FB₁-fed animals. The overexpression of TGF-β 1 by hepatocytes may be responsible for the prominent apoptosis and fibrosis seen with liver injury due to FB₁. Increased expression of c-myc and TGF-β 1 may cooperate during FB₁-induced promotion of liver tumours, possibly by providing an environment that selects for the growth of TGFβ 1 -resistant transformed liver cells. In rats given FB₁ in the presence of dietary iron overload, FB₁ augmented iron-induced lipid peroxidation in the liver. However, dietary iron loading appeared to protect against the cancer-promoting properties of FB₁, possibly due to a stimulatory effect on hepatocyte regeneration. Long-term feeding of FB₁ caused fibrosis and regenerative nodules, dysplastic hepatic nodules, cholangiofibrotic lesions, intraductal cholangiocarcinomas, and a hepatocellular carcinoma. 2 -Acetylaminofluorene enhanced the effects of FB₁ in the liver, presumably by blocking hepatocyte regeneration in response to FB₁ toxicity. Proliferating oval cells were found inside/adjacent to GST <b>pi</b> <b>positive</b> lesions, dysplastic nodules, and cholangiofibrotic lesions, suggesting that oval cells may be involved in FBI-induced hepato- and cholangiocarcinogenesis in the liver. Furthermore, the OV- 6 antigen was expressed by proliferating oval cells and bile ductules, hepatic nodules, cholangiofibrotic lesions, and cystic lesions, indicating that all of these cells may have a common ('stem') cell of origin. In conclusion, the FB₁-fed rat is a promising model for the study of liver injury, oval ('progenitor') cell proliferation, and carcinogenesis...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate whether apoptosis occurs during aortic valve surgery and whether modifying temperature during CPB has any influence on cardiomyocyte apoptotic death rate. Methods 20 patients undergoing elective aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis were randomly assigned to either moderate hypothermic (ModHT group, n = 10, 28 °C) or mild hypothermic (MiHT group, n = 10, 34 °C) CPB. Myocardial samples were obtained from the right atrium before and after weaning from CPB. Specimens were examined for apoptosis by flow cytometry analysis of annexin V-propidium iodide (PI) and Fas death receptor staining. Results In the ModHT group, non apoptotic non necrotic cells (annexin negative, PI negative) decreased after CPB, while early apoptotic (annexin <b>positive,</b> <b>PI</b> negative) and late apoptotic or necrotic (<b>PI</b> <b>positive)</b> cells increased. In contrast, no change in the different cell populations was observed over time in the MiHT group. Fas expression rose after reperfusion in the ModHT group but not in MiHT patients, in which there was even a trend for a lower Fas staining after CPB (p = 0. 08). In ModHT patients, a prolonged ischemic time tended to induce a higher increase of Fas (p = 0. 061). Conclusion Our data suggest that apoptosis signal cascade is activated at early stages during aortic valve replacement under ModHT CPB. This apoptosis induction can effectively be attenuated by a more normothermic procedure. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{fluorescent}} exclusion dye propidium iodide (PI) {{is widely}} used as a vital dye in tissue culture systems and labels the nucleus in dying cells which lack an intact plasma membrane. We have developed a method, which allows {{the preservation of the}} PI signal in paraformaldehyde-fixed tissue, enabling subsequent immunohistochemical characterisation of labelled cells.

Using confocal laser microscopy it was possible to correlate at the single cell level which cells were <b>PI</b> <b>positive</b> and which cells expressed BDPs.

Serum and tonsil biopsy samples were collected on days 0, 7, 14, 28, and then about monthly thereafter until day 251 post inoculation (PI). Virus was isolated from serum and tonsil biopsy samples through days 28 and 56 PI, respectively. Viral RNA was detected in serum and tonsil biopsy samples by RT-PCR through day 251 <b>PI,</b> although no <b>positive</b> serum samples were detected on days 84 - 196 PI. Greater proportions of day 28 and 56 PI serum samples and tonsil biopsies were found to be PRRSV RNA positive by RT-PCR than positive by virus isolation. Although 20 of 28 tonsil biopsies collected on day 84 <b>PI</b> were <b>positive</b> by RT-PCR, only one of 28 tonsil biopsies collected one month later (day 119 <b>PI)</b> was <b>positive.</b> Three pigs returned to seronegative status on or after day 196 PI.

Conversely, five pigs that were persistently infected through day 225 or 251 PI remained seropositive throughout the study although one pig had an ELISA S/P ratio of 0. 41, nearly at the cutoff point of 0. 40. The results confirm RT-PCR is more sensitive than virus isolation in identifying PRRSV-infected pigs. The abrupt drop in the proportion of pigs with RT-PCR positive tonsil samples from day 84 to day 119 PI indicates most pigs clear the virus within three to four months, but some may remain persistently infected for several months...|$|R

In order {{to control the}} equivalence ratio, the O- 2 mole fraction of intake gas was reduced from 21 to 11. 16 % by adding only N- 2 to intake gas while the injected fuel quantity was held constant. The test was used a single-cylinder compression ignition (Cl) engine with a displacement volume of 373. 3 cc, a compression ratio of 17. 8, a re-entrant type piston-bowl. The emission measurement instruments consisted of emission bench (MEXA- 9100 D, HORIBA) and smoke meter (AVL- 415 S, AVL). In the result, the maximum IMEP (indicated mean effective pressure) and fuel conversion efficiency gradually decreased when the equivalence ratio was richer. In particular, the stoichiometric condition (i. e. 1. 0 equivalence ratio) had around 15 % and 11 % losses, respectively. The stoichiometric diesel combustion had a <b>positive</b> <b>ignition</b> dwell over the whole operating condition, leading to {{a large amount of}} THC (total hydrocarbons) and CO emission.

We {{considered the possibility}} that the properties of the intact protein that may alter the likelihood of being taken up by antigen presenting cells, may be useful adjuncts in predicting allergens and non-allergens in silico. It has been shown that negatively charged acidic proteins are preferentially processed by dendritic cells. Methodology: Datasets (aeroallergen, food-allergen and non-allergen) for in-silico study were obtained from public databases. Isoelectric point (pI), net charge, and electrostatic potential (EP) were calculated from the protein sequence (for pI and net charge) or predicted structure (for EP). Result: Allergens and non allergens differed significantly in pI, net charge, and EP (p, 0. 0001). Cluster analysis based on these parameters resulted in well defined clusters. Non-allergens were characterized by neutral to basic pI (mean 6 SE, 7. 660. 16) and positive charge. In contrast allergens were acidic (5. 760. 15) and negatively charged. Surface electrostatic potentials calculated from predicted structures were mostly negative for allergens and mostly positive for non-allergens. The classification accuracy for non-allergens was superior to that for allergens. Thus neutral to basic <b>pI,</b> <b>positive</b> charge, and positive electrostatic potentials characterize non-allergens, and seem rare in allergens (p, 0. 0001). It may be possible t...|$|R

The immune cells were then harvested and evaluated for propidium iodide (<b>PI)</b> <b>positive</b> cells by FACS analysis.

The results showed that the expression of IDO in dermal fibroblasts significantly induces apoptotic death of PBMC, CD 4 +-, CD 8 +- and B cell-riched primary lymphocytes, Jurkat cells, and THP- 1 cells. IDO-mediated damage of immune cells was restored by an addition of tryptophan and IDO inhibitor. Using the same approaches, we also demonstrated that skin cells and endothelial cells are remarkably resistant to tryptophan-deficient environment. Furthermore, no significant difference in cell proliferation between Ad-GFP (control) - and Ad-IDO-GFP-infected either keratinocytes or fibroblasts, was found. The results of this study, therefore, suggest that the expression of IDO by dermal fibroblasts mediates immune cell damage and this may shed a new light toward developing a non-rejectable skin substitute in the future...|$|R

Results Sequential 24 -h exposure with MTX (0. 005 - 0. 02 mumol) {{followed by}} 6 MP (1 - 10 mumol) and 24 -h exposure with TF (5 - 20 mumol) followed by TG (0. 5 - 2 mumol) showed a more than additive induction of apoptosis compared with single-drug exposure. Simultaneous administration of the drugs does not show an additive effect on apoptosis. Conclusions The results of this study indicate that sequential administration of MTX before 6 MP and of TF before TG may be essential for therapeutic success in the treatment of leukaemi...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanism}} of cell death induced by Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans leukotoxin (LTX) {{has been investigated}} with flow cytometry and patch electrode recording using cultured HL 60 cells. The kinetics of propidium iodide (<b>PI)</b> <b>positive</b> staining of HL 60 cells was measured {{as a function of}} LTX concentration at 37 °C. Results showed a concentration-dependent decrease in the tk times. Cell kill was slow at < 1 μg/ml LTX concentrations with fewer than 50 % of the cells killed after 1 h; at 1 μg/ml, the tk times ranged from ∼ 15 to 30 min. At higher concentrations, the tk times decreased rapidly. The rate of cell kill was appreciably slowed at 20 °C. HL 60 whole cell currents were recorded with patch electrodes. Immediately following exposure to high concentrations of LTX, large currents were recorded suggesting that the membrane potential of these cells had collapsed due to the large conductance increases. At low toxin concentrations, rapid conductance fluctuations were seen suggestive of a limited number of toxin-mediated events. Cells exposed to low concentrations of LTX exhibited these conductance fluctuations for up to 1 h, whereas toxin-insensitive cells were unaffected by long exposures to high concentrations of toxin. Our results are consistent with LTX-induced pores in susceptible cells which overwhelm the ability of the cell to maintain osmotic homeostasis causing cell death...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} {{a system of}} nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations arising {{as a model of}} laminar flames in a premixed reactive gas. The existence of traveling wave solutions has been established for <b>positive</b> <b>ignition</b> temperature by Berestycki, Nicolaenko, and Scheurer and by Terman for zero ignition temperature. Stability and instability of these solutions have been established in various situations by Sivashinsky, Clavin, and recently Terman. Our goal is to study the equations with initial data that are bounded, uniformly continuous, and nonnegative but otherwise arbitrary. We establish the existence of unique global strong solutions satisfying appropriate a priori estimates. With a positivity condition imposed on the initial data for the temperature, we show that the concentration decays exponentially. This result, while easy to obtain, {{plays an important role in}} results that follow. Of greatest physical interest are the cases where ignition occurs precisely at one end. Our main result is that if the average of the initial temperature values at the ends of the chamber is above ignition temperature, then on any ray coming from the ignition end the temperature is uniformly above ignition temperature, and the concentration decays uniformly to zero. We can continually advance the endpoint of this zone of ignition, thus roughly mimicking the motion of traveling wave solutions. We also point out the appropriateness of the averaging condition on the initial temperature and discuss two examples where this averaging condition is not satisfied: in one, we eventually have flame propagation and in the other example we have eventual flame extinguishment on any ray coming from the cold end of the chamber...|$|R
40|$|A {{social group}} is {{represented}} by a graph, where each pair of nodes is connected by two oppositely directed links. At the beginning, a given amount p(i) of resources is assigned randomly to each node i. Also, each link r(i,j) is initially represented by a random positive value, which means the percentage of resources of node i which is offered to node j. Initially then, the graph is fully connected, i. e. all non-diagonal matrix elements r(i,j) are different from zero. During the simulation, the amounts of resources p(i) change according to the balance equation. Also, nodes reorganise their activity with time, going to give more resources to those which give them more. This is the rule of varying the coefficients r(i,j). The result is that after some transient time, only some pairs (m,n) of nodes survive with non-zero p(m) and p(n), each pair with symmetric and positive r(m,n) =r(n,m). Other coefficients r(m,i n) vanish. Unpaired nodes remain with no resources, i. e. their p(i) = 0, and they cease to be active, as {{they have nothing to}} offer. The percentage of survivors (i. e. those with with <b>p(i)</b> <b>positive)</b> increases with the velocity of varying the numbers r(i,j), and it slightly decreases with the size of the group. The picture and the results can be interpreted as a description of a social algorithm leading to marriages. Comment: 7 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} report 15 day-old Wistar rats were {{injected}} with 0. 3 μmol of diphenyl ditelluride (PhTe) 2 /kg body weight and parameters of neurodegeneration were analyzed in slices from striatum 6 days afterwards. We found hyperphosphorylation of intermediate filament (IF) proteins from astrocyte (glial fibrillary acidic protein—GFAP and vimentin) and from neuron (low-, medium- and {{high molecular weight}} neurofilament subunits: NF-L, NF-M and NF-H, respectively) and increased MAPK (Erk, JNK and p 38 MAPK) as well as PKA activities. The treatment induced reactive astrogliosis in the striatum, evidenced by increased GFAP and vimentin immunocontent {{as well as their}} mRNA overexpression. Also, (PhTe) 2 significantly increased the propidium iodide (<b>PI)</b> <b>positive</b> cells in NeuN positive population without altering PI incorporation into GFAP positive cells, indicating that in vivo exposure to (PhTe) 2 provoked neuronal damage. Immunohistochemistry showed a dramatic increase of GFAP staining characteristic of reactive astrogliosis. Moreover, increased caspase 3 in (PhTe) 2 treated striatal slices suggested apoptotic cell death. (PhTe) 2 exposure decreased Akt immunoreactivity, however phospho-GSK- 3 -β (Ser 9) was unaltered, suggesting that this kinase is not directly implicated in the neurotoxicity of this compound. Therefore, the present results shed light into the mechanisms of (PhTe) 2 -induced neurodegeneration in rat striatum, evidencing a critical role for the MAPK and Akt signaling pathways and disruption of cytoskeletal homeostasis, which could be related with apoptotic neuronal death and astrogliosis...|$|R
