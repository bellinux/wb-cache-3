5|$|Passive constructions {{also use}} {{auxiliary}} verbs. A passive construction rephrases an active construction {{in such a}} way that the object of the active <b>phrase</b> becomes the subject of the passive <b>phrase,</b> and the subject of the active <b>phrase</b> is either omitted or demoted to a role as an oblique argument introduced in a prepositional <b>phrase.</b> They are formed by using the past participle either with the auxiliary verb to be or to get, although not all varieties of English allow the use of passives with get. For example, putting the sentence she sees him into the passive becomes he is seen (by her), or he gets seen (by her).|$|E

First, igai <b>phrases</b> are, both igaino and igaini, additional in that sentences are acceptable without igai <b>phrases.</b> Thus, igai <b>phrases</b> add some meanings to them. How igai <b>phrases</b> add meanings are determined by structural relations. Since igaino <b>phrases</b> modify NPs, exclusion operations are applied between igaino <b>phrases</b> and NPs. In the case of igaini <b>phrases,</b> they modify VPs, and exclusion operations are applied between igaini <b>phrases</b> and VPs.

However, few researchers have empirically studied the issue of how enforcement <b>phrases</b> are processed. The present study explored the neural features of processing two types of enforcement <b>phrases</b> (severe-and-deterrent vs. mild-and-polite <b>phrases)</b> used during OHS inspections by applying event-related potentials (ERP) method. ERP data were recorded while the participants distinguished between severe-and-deterrent <b>phrases</b> and mild-and-polite <b>phrases</b> depicted in written Chinese words. The ERP results showed that severe-and-deterrent <b>phrases</b> elicited significantly augmented P 300 amplitude with a central-parietal scalp distribution compared with mild-and-polite <b>phrases,</b> indicating the allocation of more attention resource to and elaborately processing of the severe-and-deterrent <b>phrases.</b> It reveals that humans may consider the severe-and-deterrent <b>phrases</b> as more motivationally significant and elaborately process the severity and deterrence information contained in the enforcement <b>phrases</b> for the adaptive protection. The current study provides an objective and supplementary way to measure the efficiency of different enforcement <b>phrases</b> at neural level, which may help generate appropriate enforcement <b>phrases</b> and improve the performance of OHS inspections...|$|R
