Instead, Arnold and Holliman have proposed that other groupings be used, such as classifying emergency medical systems as following a specialty or multidisciplinary model.

Such an approach would seek to categorize pre-hospital care separately from in-hospital systems.

At this dose, 19 of 20 (95%) patients responded to treatment, with 12 of 20 (60%) becoming symptom free. Only one patient was refractory to treatment. Microdialysis levels of histamine, IL-6 and IL-8 assessed 1-3 h after cold challenge (4 °C) were significantly (P < 0.05) decreased following up-dosing with 80 mg bilastine.

40|$|<b>Primary</b> <b>variable</b> {{switching}} {{appears as}} a promising numerical technique for variably saturated flows. While the standard pressure-based form of the Richards equation can suffer from poor mass balance accuracy, the mixed form with its improved conservative properties can possess convergence difficulties for dry initial conditions. On the other hand, variable switching can overcome most of the stated numerical problems. The paper deals with variable switching for finite elements in two and three dimensions. The technique is incorporated in both an adaptive error-controlled predictor–corrector one-step Newton (PCOSN) iteration strategy and a target-based full Newton (TBFN) iteration scheme. Both schemes provide different behaviors with respect to accuracy and solution effort. Additionally, a simplified upstream weighting technique is used. Compared with conventional approaches the <b>primary</b> <b>variable</b> switching technique represents a fast and robust strategy for unsaturated problems with dry initial conditions. The impact of the <b>primary</b> <b>variable</b> switching technique is studied {{over a wide range}} of mostly 2 D and partly difficult-to-solve problems (infiltration, drainage, perched water table, capillary barrier), where comparable results are available.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the issue of}} {{invariance}} for various hybrid/mixed models with and without incompatible displacement modes is addressed. Special emphasis is directed to assumed spaces of the <b>primary</b> <b>variables</b> {{which are based on}} the natural co-ordinates.

In contrast to the traditional concept of choosing the starting stress/strain interpolants based on either global or local co-ordinate systems, it is shown that {{it is not necessary to}} employ either complete or balanced polynomial expansions of natural co-ordinates in order to preserve the element invariance. Based on one of the newly proposed classes of stress/strain interpolants, 8 -node invariant-assumed stress brick elements are proposed which are close to Loikkanen and Irons' assumed stress counterpart of Wilson's Q 6 brick element. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} some numerical {{and theoretical}} aspects of dual Schur domain decomposition methods for linear first-order transient partial differential equations. In this work, {{we consider the}} trapezoidal family of schemes for integrating the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for each subdomain and present four different coupling methods, corresponding to different algebraic constraints, for enforcing kinematic continuity on the interface between the subdomains. Method 1 (d-continuity) {{is based on the}} conventional approach using continuity of the <b>primary</b> <b>variable</b> and we show that this method is unstable for a lot of commonly used time integrators including the mid-point rule. To alleviate this difficulty, we propose a new Method 2 (Modified d-continuity) and prove its stability for coupling all time integrators in the trapezoidal family (except the forward Euler). Method 3 (v-continuity) is based on enforcing the continuity of the time derivative of the <b>primary</b> <b>variable.</b> However, this constraint introduces a drift in the <b>primary</b> <b>variable</b> on the interface. We present Method 4 (Baumgarte stabilized) which uses Baumgarte stabilization to limit this drift and we derive bounds for the stabilization parameter to ensure stability.
