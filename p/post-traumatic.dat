5|$|Former superhero Jessica Jones, {{who suffers}} from <b>post-traumatic</b> stress disorder, opens her own detective agency to help people.|$|E
5|$|He {{has been}} {{suffering}} from serious {{physical and mental health}} issues, including schizophrenia and <b>post-traumatic</b> stress disorder.|$|E
5|$|Movement {{disorders}} {{that may}} develop after TBI include tremor, ataxia (uncoordinated muscle movements), myoclonus (shock-like contractions of muscles), {{and loss of}} movement range and control (in particular {{with a loss of}} movement repertoire). The risk of <b>post-traumatic</b> seizures increases with severity of trauma (image at right) and is particularly elevated with certain types of brain trauma such as cerebral contusions or hematomas. People with early seizures, those occurring within a week of injury, have an increased risk of <b>post-traumatic</b> epilepsy (recurrent seizures occurring more than a week after the initial trauma). People may lose or experience altered vision, hearing, or smell.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis can be complex because {{concussion}} shares symptoms {{with other}} conditions. For example, post-concussion {{symptoms such as}} cognitive problems may be misattributed to brain injury when, in fact, due to <b>post-traumatic</b> stress disorder (PTSD).|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} time in state history, the Connecticut state {{judicial}} branch offered <b>post-traumatic</b> stress assistance to jurors, who served for two months on the triple-murder trial, because they had been required to look at disturbing images and hear grisly testimony.|$|E
5|$|There are {{fundamental}} {{problems at the}} Veterans Health Administration of staffing being inadequate for aging Vietnam veterans and for more recent veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan who may have complex health challenges such as traumatic brain injury, multiple limb amputations and prosthetics, diabetes and <b>post-traumatic</b> stress disorder.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis of MTBI {{is based}} on {{physical}} and neurological examination findings, duration of unconsciousness (usually less than 30minutes) and <b>post-traumatic</b> amnesia (PTA; usually less than 24hours), and the Glasgow Coma Scale (MTBI sufferers have scores of 13 to 15). Neuropsychological tests exist to measure cognitive function and the international consensus meeting in Zurich recommended {{the use of the}} SCAT2 test.|$|E
5|$|His {{mental health}} {{has been a}} subject of controversy. He has {{repeatedly}} claimed he was tortured while in prison. He was diagnosed with dementia, major depressive disorder, and <b>post-traumatic</b> stress disorder from 2005 to 2007, which helped influence the verdict {{of one of his}} corruption trials. He now claims he is completely healthy, with only high blood pressure and diabetes.|$|E
5|$|In a {{press conference}} on January 16, 2013 shortly after being {{notified}} he would receive the medal, Romesha played down his actions in the conflict, noting many other veterans who had received more serious injuries in the battle. Romesha noted {{that he did not}} suffer <b>post-traumatic</b> stress disorder or other lasting psychological injuries from deployment, but that others he knew during the deployment did.|$|E
5|$|Mental disorders, such {{as major}} {{depressive}} disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, <b>post-traumatic</b> stress disorder, {{attention deficit hyperactivity}} disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, Tourette syndrome, and addiction, are known {{to relate to the}} functioning of the brain. Treatment for mental disorders may include psychotherapy, psychiatry, social intervention and personal recovery work or cognitive behavioural therapy; the underlying issues and associated prognoses vary significantly between individuals.|$|E
5|$|Pharmacological {{treatment}} {{can help to}} manage psychiatric or behavioral problems. Medication {{is also used to}} control <b>post-traumatic</b> epilepsy; however the preventive use of anti-epileptics is not recommended. In those cases where the person is bedridden due to a reduction of consciousness, has to remain in a wheelchair because of mobility problems, or has any other problem heavily impacting self-caring capacities, caregiving and nursing are critical.|$|E
5|$|Some studies shows {{correlation}} of reduced hippocampus volume and {{posttraumatic stress disorder}} (PTSD). A study of Vietnam War combat veterans with PTSD showed a 20% reduction in the volume of their hippocampus compared with veterans having suffered no such symptoms. This finding was not replicated in chronic PTSD patients traumatized at an air show plane crash in 1988 (Ramstein, Germany). A 2016 study strengthened theory that a smaller hippocampus increases the risk for <b>post-traumatic</b> stress disorder, and a larger hippocampus {{increases the likelihood of}} efficacious treatment.|$|E
5|$|The {{images and}} media reports of {{children}} dying terrorized many children who, {{as demonstrated by}} later research, showed symptoms of <b>post-traumatic</b> stress disorder. Children became a primary focus of concern {{in the mental health}} response to bombing and many bomb related services were delivered to the community, young and old alike. These services were delivered to public schools of Oklahoma and reached approximately 40,000 students. One of the first organized mental health activities in Oklahoma City was a clinical study of {{middle and high school students}} conducted 7 weeks after the bombing. The study focused on middle and high school students that had no connection or relation to the victims of the bombing. This study showed that these students, although deeply moved by the event and showing a sense of vulnerability on the matter, had no difficulty with the demands of school or home life, contrasting those who were connected to the bombing and its victims, who suffered from <b>post-traumatic</b> stress disorder.|$|E
5|$|The {{injured and}} {{witnesses}} among university staff and students suffered {{a variety of}} physical, social, existential, financial, and psychological consequences, including <b>post-traumatic</b> stress disorder. A number of students committed suicide. In the suicide letters {{of at least two}} of them, the anguish they suffered following the massacre was cited as the reason for killing themselves. Nine years after the event, survivors reported still being affected by their experiences, though with time some of the effects had lessened.|$|E
5|$|Abra's initial role in {{the show}} was that of Third World rights {{champion}} and humorous surgical , whose major storylines centered on serious rule breaking (including stealing returned anti-retroviral drugs to send to African countries in need, performing an experimental xenotransplantation without authorisation, and secretly using Holby City Hospital's theatres at night to perform charity operations on African children) {{as well as his}} relationship with colleague nurse Kyla Tyson. Upon returning to the show in April 2008, the character took a darker turn, resorting to self-harm as a symptom of <b>post-traumatic</b> stress, following a harrowing experience in the war torn Congo.|$|E
5|$|After the Armistice of Mudros (30 October 1918), several {{surviving}} Armenian intellectuals {{came back}} to Constantinople, which was under an allied occupation. They started a short, but intense, literary activity that was ended by the Turkish victory in 1923. Those who have written memoirs and books about their accounts during the deportation include Grigoris Balakian, Aram Andonian, Yervant Odian, Teotig, and Mikayel Shamtanchyan. Other survivors, such as Komitas, developed serious cases of <b>post-traumatic</b> stress disorder. Komitas underwent 20 years of treatment in mental asylums {{until his death in}} 1935.|$|E
5|$|Brain damage, {{or disease}} of the brain can {{manifest}} {{in a wide variety}} of ways. Traumatic brain injury, for example in contact sport, after a fall, or in traffic or work accidents, can be associated with both immediate and longer-term problems. Immediate problems that develop may include bleeding within the skull, compressing the brain tissue or damaging its blood supply, skull fractures, injury to a particular area, deafness, and concussion. In addition to the site of injury, the opposite side of the brain may be affected, termed a contrecoup injury. Longer-term issues that may develop include <b>post-traumatic</b> stress, hydrocephalus, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy.|$|E
5|$|H.D. and Aldington {{attempted}} to salvage their relationship during this time, {{but he was}} suffering from the effects of his participation in the war, possibly <b>post-traumatic</b> stress disorder, and they became estranged, living completely separate lives, but not divorcing until 1938. They remained friends, however, {{for the rest of their}} lives. From 1920, her relationship with Bryher became closer, and the pair travelled in Egypt, Greece and the United States before eventually settling in Switzerland. Bryher entered a marriage of convenience in 1921 with Robert McAlmon, which allowed him to fund his publishing ventures in Paris by utilising some of her personal wealth for his Contact Press. Both Bryher and H.D. slept with McAlmon during this time. Bryher and McAlmon divorced in 1927.|$|E
5|$|The {{hippocampus}} contains {{high levels}} of glucocorticoid receptors, which make it more vulnerable to long-term stress than most other brain areas. There is evidence that humans having experienced severe, long-lasting traumatic stress show atrophy of the hippocampus more than of {{other parts of the}} brain. These effects show up in <b>post-traumatic</b> stress disorder, and they may contribute to the hippocampal atrophy reported in schizophrenia and severe depression. A recent study has also revealed atrophy as a result of depression, but this can be stopped with anti-depressants even if they are not effective in relieving other symptoms.|$|E
5|$|The {{residential}} school system harmed Indigenous children significantly by removing {{them from their}} families, depriving them of their ancestral languages, exposing many of them to physical and sexual abuse, and forcibly enfranchising them. Disconnected from their families and culture and forced to speak English or French, students who attended the {{residential school}} system often graduated unable to fit into either their communities or Canadian society. It ultimately proved successful in disrupting the transmission of Indigenous practices and beliefs across generations. The legacy of the system {{has been linked to}} an increased prevalence of <b>post-traumatic</b> stress, alcoholism, substance abuse, and suicide, which persist within Indigenous communities.|$|E
5|$|There are few data on comorbid {{conditions}}, {{but there}} are some conditions that arise in the same circumstances in which RAD arises, such as institutionalization or maltreatment. These are principally developmental delays and language disorders associated with neglect. Conduct disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, anxiety disorders, <b>post-traumatic</b> stress disorder and social phobia share many symptoms and are often comorbid with or confused with RAD. Attachment disorder behaviors amongst institutionalized children are correlated with attentional and conduct problems and cognitive levels but nonetheless appear to index a distinct set of symptoms and behaviors.|$|E
5|$|Trent Milton {{was born}} in Newcastle, New South Wales, on 4 May 1972. He {{currently}} lives in Lake Cathie, New South Wales. On 5 March 2011, a motorcycle accident {{on the way home}} from work in Port Macquarie tore off his right leg. It also led to a brain injury. Doctors considered amputating both his arms – his right arm hung by a thread – but managed to save both, which they fastened back together with steel plates. He suffered <b>post-traumatic</b> amnesia, and spent a year in recovery.|$|E
5|$|Audie Murphy (20 June 1925 – 28 May 1971) {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{decorated}} United States Army combat soldiers of World War II, serving from 1942 to 1945. He received every American combat award for valor available at the time of his service, including the Medal of Honor. He also received recognitions from France and Belgium. With his 1945 military discharge at the end of the war, Murphy became an advocate of treatment for <b>post-traumatic</b> stress disorder in veterans. The Audie L. Murphy Memorial VA Hospital in San Antonio and the Sergeant Audie Murphy Clubs (SAMC) on military bases honor his contributions. He joined the Texas National Guard in 1950, transferring to reserve status in 1956 and remaining in the Guard until 1969. He also had a civilian career as a film actor and songwriter. Recognitions he received both during his lifetime and posthumously are listed below.|$|E
5|$|Kyla briefly re-unites with Abra, when {{he reveals}} {{to her that}} he was subject to a machete attack in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, however he then leaves Holby once more to check himself into a {{psychiatric}} hospital. When Lola Griffin (Sharon D. Clarke) finds Abra being treated for <b>post-traumatic</b> stress by his own mother, she and Kyla convince Abra to discharge himself and return to Ghana. Shortly thereafter, Max is accepted into a prestigious football academy in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Kyla hands in her notice, intent on leaving with him, however Max convinces Abra to return and take Kyla back to Ghana with him. Kyla initially refuses, but comes to realise that Max only wants to make her happy, and agrees to leave with Abra, who proposes marriage to her.|$|E
5|$|Summer Glau as River Tam– smuggled {{onto the}} ship by her brother. She {{is a highly}} intelligent, {{compassionate}} and intuitive child prodigy. Experiments and invasive brain surgery at an Alliance secret facility left her delusional, paranoid, and at times violent, though her uncanny ability to seemingly sense things before they happen leaves questions as to where the delusions end and reality begins for her. The experiments seemed to have made her a psychic. The experiments also gave her a seemingly innate ability in hand-to-hand combat, and she is capable of killing or incapacitating several opponents with ease. She gets frequent fits of anxiety and experiences <b>post-traumatic</b> flashbacks of her time in the Alliance facility. Her mental instability and uncanny abilities, paired with several erratic and violent acts, are a recurring source of fear and doubt among the crew, especially with Jayne, whom she once slashed with a knife. Jayne very frequently requests that River and Simon {{be taken off the}} ship.|$|E
5|$|The court {{decided that}} it would be {{reasonably}} possible for a jury to convict Thomas based on the available evidence, so it then considered whether there were factors which would make a retrial unjust. Thomas' lawyer Lex Lasry argued that the delay in Thomas' prosecution (he was not arrested until seventeen months after he returned to Australia) and the extensive media coverage of the case meant it was unlikely Thomas would get a fair trial, and that a retrial would be an undue hardship on Thomas given that he has spent long periods in custody, mostly in solitary confinement, without conviction, which has led to him being diagnosed with depression and <b>post-traumatic</b> stress disorder. The court was of the opinion that a fair trial was not impossible in these circumstances, and although the other factors were considered, the court ultimately decided that the circumstances did not preclude a retrial.|$|E
5|$|The {{desire to}} self-harm {{is a common}} symptom of {{borderline}} personality disorder. People with other mental disorders may also self-harm, including those with depression, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, eating disorders, <b>post-traumatic</b> stress disorder, schizophrenia, and several personality disorders. Self-harm can also occur in high-functioning individuals who have no underlying mental health diagnosis. The motivations for self-harm vary. Some {{use it as a}} coping mechanism to provide temporary relief of intense feelings such as anxiety, depression, stress, emotional numbness, or a sense of failure. Self-harm is often associated with a history of trauma, including emotional and sexual abuse. There are a number of different methods {{that can be used to}} treat self-harm and which concentrate on either treating the underlying causes or on treating the behaviour itself. When self-harm is associated with depression, antidepressant drugs and therapy may be effective. Other approaches involve avoidance techniques, which focus on keeping the individual occupied with other activities, or replacing the act of self-harm with safer methods that do not lead to permanent damage.|$|E
5|$|Belle and Aden grow close again, {{and begin}} seeing {{one another in}} secret, as Belle is still dating Angelo. Aden's {{relationship}} with her deteriorates when Belle develops <b>post-traumatic</b> stress disorder after being attacked. She later refuses to leave hospital after being injured in a fire, and becomes addicted to the prescription medication that she takes for anxiety. Aden's feelings for Nicole are reignited, and they have sex several times before being caught together by Belle. Roman throws Aden out for sleeping with his daughter. Drug addict Liam Murphy (Axle Whitehead) deepens the rift between Aden and Belle, but they eventually reconcile and become engaged. In order {{to pay for a}} wedding ring, Aden takes a loan from corrupt bookmaker Clint, and loses several football matches on Clint's instruction. He refuses to ruin Geoff's career by injuring him, however, so Clint has Aden beaten up. Belle learns that she has terminal cancer and pushes the wedding forward, but does not tell Aden. He is devastated to learn of her condition the day before the ceremony, but is convinced {{to go ahead with the}} wedding by Roman. He and Belle spend four weeks together as husband and wife before she dies. Following her death, Aden becomes reclusive. He eventually returns to work, and is saved by Geoff when he almost drowns in an accident, which results in them becoming friends.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Lethbridge's wife Sylvia {{had been}} having affairs with various men, and he himself had begun an affair with Sylvia's younger cousin Mina, who was a {{secretary}} at the museum. The couple divorced in June 1943, and in November Lethbridge sold Mount Blow to pay a settlement to Sylvia. He married Mina in July 1944 at Oban, and together they moved from Cambridge to a farm on the Scottish island of Kerrera, where Lethbridge excavated some local caves. But the couple found life on Kerrera too isolated and soon returned to Cambridge, despite Lethbridge's dislike of the place {{and most of the}} university staff whom he worked alongside. He nevertheless continued his archaeological investigations, excavating an Anglo-Saxon cemetery at Lackford on Cavenham Heath, and involving himself in the investigation of the newly unearthed Mildenhall Treasure, being the individual responsible for locating its probable discovery spot. He {{was among the first to}} take an interest in the cemeteries of the Mid Anglo-Saxon period, believing that the lack of 'pagan' objects such as weapons reflected the fact that those buried in two seventh-century cemeteries were among the earliest Anglo-Saxon Christians. In January 1948, Lethbridge received word that his son Hugh had committed suicide after suffering <b>post-traumatic</b> stress disorder during his time in the armed forces.|$|E
5|$|Some {{users of}} the drug {{consider}} it an entheogen and a tool to supplement practices for transcendence, including meditation and psychonautics. The intensity and duration {{of the effects of}} psilocybin are variable, depending on species or cultivar of mushrooms, dosage, individual physiology, and set and setting, as was shown in experiments led by Timothy Leary at Harvard University in the early 1960s. Once ingested, psilocybin is rapidly metabolized to psilocin, which then acts on serotonin receptors in the brain. The mind-altering effects of psilocybin typically last from two to six hours, although to individuals under the influence of psilocybin, the effects may seem to last much longer, since the drug can distort the perception of time. Psilocybin has a low toxicity and a relatively low harm potential, and reports of lethal doses of the drug are rare. Several modern bioanalytical methods have been adapted to rapidly and accurately screen the levels of psilocybin in mushroom samples and body fluids. Since the 1990s, there has been a renewal of scientific research into the potential medical and psychological therapeutic benefits of psilocybin for treating conditions including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), <b>post-traumatic</b> stress disorder, social anxiety, treatment-resistant depression, cluster headaches, and anxiety related to terminal cancer. Possession of psilocybin-containing mushrooms has been outlawed in most countries, and it has been classified as a scheduled drug by many national drug laws.|$|E
5|$|Rodimus, {{being given}} {{half of the}} Matrix, decides to lead {{a search for the}} fabled Knights of Cybertron in the hope that they can help restore order to Cybertron. Taking to the stars on board the ship called the Lost Light, Rodimus is joined by Ultra Magnus and Drift as his second-and-third-in-commands, Ratchet, Chromedome, Rewind, Swerve, Brainstorm, Rung, Whirl and a {{reformed}} Cyclonus, among several others. Following an unexpected quantum jump upon launch, the Lost Light is hurled off into the depths of space, where the crew is joined by Skids and contends with a stowaway Sparkeater. A visit to Delphi by Ratchet to help cure a plague introduces the threat of the Decepticon Justice Division, who then feature in a Decepticon-dedicated story menacing a band of misfit Decepticons, and also brings the facility's surviving patients and staff onto the ship—including Fortress Maximus, whose <b>post-traumatic</b> stress causes him to snap and nearly kill Rung. Hoping to cure Rung's damaged brain, Rewind gathers a small group together to recount a shared story from their past about Orion Pax foiling a Senate plot to discredit the burgeoning Decepticon movement in the days of Functionism. Chromedome is manipulated by Drift into carrying out a plan laid out by Prowl: using his mnemosurgery skills to tap the memories and learn the secrets of mass-murdering Decepticon Overlord, secretly hidden on board the Lost Light. Unfortunately, Chromedome accidentally allows Overlord to escape, and Rewind has to sacrifice himself to jettison the monster from the ship before the section of the ship is blown up. Drift admits to responsibility for Overlord's actions, resulting in his exile, even though Rodimus later reveals he {{was a part of the}} plot as well. Ultra Magnus is also fatally wounded in the battle, but when his body disappears from the ship's Medibay, the crew track it to Luna 1, where they discover and foil a twisted plot by Chief Justice Tyrest to wipe out all those Transformers he sees as tainted by original sin.|$|E
25|$|Judge White, {{suffering}} from <b>post-traumatic</b> stress, has a psychotic breakdown {{and goes on}} a rampage.|$|E
25|$|Military sexual {{trauma is}} a {{stronger}} predictor of <b>Post-Traumatic</b> Stress Disorder than serving in combat is.|$|E
25|$|Many {{more studies}} {{illustrate}} the problem. One meta-study {{was conducted by}} the psychiatry department of Oxford University at Warneford Hospital in the United Kingdom. Twenty surveys were analyzed, providing results for 6,743 adult refugees from seven countries. In the larger studies, 9% were diagnosed with <b>post-traumatic</b> stress disorder and 5% with major depression, with evidence of much psychiatric co-morbidity. Five surveys of 260 refugee children from three countries yielded a prevalence of 11% for <b>post-traumatic</b> stress disorder. According to this study, refugees resettled in Western countries could be about ten {{times more likely to}} have PTSD than age-matched general populations in those countries. Worldwide, tens of thousands of refugees and former refugees resettled in Western countries probably have <b>post-traumatic</b> stress disorder.|$|E
25|$|There {{is mixed}} {{evidence}} for the utility of emotional approach coping in samples of women with breast cancer. In a longitudinal study of women with breast cancer, for women who perceived their social environments to be receptive, emotional expression predicted improved quality of life. Coping through emotional expression among women with breast cancer has also been found to predict an increase in <b>post-traumatic</b> growth. However, other studies have not found the same link between emotional expression and <b>post-traumatic</b> growth.|$|E
25|$|Since 2009, Coutu {{participated in}} or hosted three dozen forums on energy, sexting, capital punishment, <b>post-traumatic</b> stress disorder, {{and the state}} budget.|$|E
