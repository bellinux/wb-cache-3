50|$|In March 1996 Perry {{approved}} a new DoD comprehensive acquisition policy that emphasized commercial practices and products. Program managers and other acquisition officials {{would have the}} power to use their professional judgment in purchasing. The plan canceled more than 30 separate acquisition <b>policy</b> <b>memoranda</b> and report formats and replaced existing policy documents with new ones that were about 90% shorter. Perry considered these reforms one of his most important accomplishments, and saw savings generated by the new practices as part of the key to adequate funding of the military in an era of continuing tight budgets. In a further effort to save money Perry resorted to base closures and realignments. In May 1994 he and General John M. Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, announced that Defense would go forward, as required by law, with a 1995 round of base closings. In doing so Defense would consider the economic impact on the affected communities and the capacity to manage the reuse of closed facilities.|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. icant. US policy considers offsets to be economically inefficient and market distorting, restricts US government agency involvement in offsets, and places responsibility for such arrangements with businesses. Offset {{policy has been}} the subject of intense and frequently conflicting policy initiatives undertaken between 1973 and 2003, involving both the executive and legislative branches of government. This thesis details why and how US policy on offsets evolved, identifying key participants and policy decisions. This thesis concludes that initially the primary policy drivers were DOD desires to preserve prerogatives to domestically produce foreign designs and to avoid unnecessary friction with allies. DOD led policy development within the executive branch with the publication of offsets <b>policy</b> <b>memoranda</b> by the Deputy Secretary of Defense. While no single focus for congressional offsets policy was identified, a primary policy driver was the perceived loss of jobs resulting from offsets, as legislators from states and districts where organized labor was strong led efforts to mandate restrictions and reporting requirements. Important differences emerged between the legislative and executive branches, regardless of administration, regarding offsets. These included differences regarding the effect of offsets on domestic employment and technology transfer and the appropriate US response to demands for offsets.
