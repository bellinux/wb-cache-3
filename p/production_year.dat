25|$|All four-speed manual {{transmissions}} {{were built}} at the Muncie, Indiana Allison plant. The 1984 production line saw two transmissions, a performance four-speed with a final drive ratio of 4.10, and an economy four-speed with a final drive ratio of 3.32. The V6 on the 1985 model {{and part of the}} 1986 <b>production</b> <b>year</b> came with a four-speed with a final drive ratio of 3.65.

25|$|It {{should be}} noted that these are Production dates. Whilst some models may have been {{produced}} on the production line to Customer pre-order specifications, the majority would not instantly be purchased, registered and 'on the road'.

If that used vehicle is then exported and sold in the UK in say 2003, then the DVLA 'first registered' date is very likely to be 2003.|$|E

25|$|The 1953 {{model year}} {{was not only}} the Corvette's first <b>production</b> <b>year,</b> but at 300 {{produced}} it was also the lowest-volume Corvette. The cars were essentially hand-built and techniques evolved during the production cycle, so that each 1953 Corvette is slightly different. All 1953 models had Polo White exteriors, red interiors, and black canvas soft tops. Order guides showed heaters and AM radios as optional, but all 1953 models were equipped with both. Over two hundred 1953 Corvettes are known to exist today. They had independent front suspension, but featured a rigid axle supported by longitudinal leaf springs at the rear. The cost of the first production model Corvettes in 1953 was $3490.|$|E
25|$|In late 1981, Toyota {{completely}} redesigned the Celica Supra {{as well as}} {{the entire}} Celica lineup for its 1982 <b>production</b> <b>year.</b> In Japan, they were known as Celica XX, but everywhere else the Celica Supra name was used. Still being based around the Celica platform, there were several key differences, most notably the design of the front end and fully retractable pop-up headlights. Other differences would be the inline-6 still present in the Supra instead of the inline-4 as well as an increase in length and wheelbase to accommodate the larger engine. Vehicles installed with the 5M engine were slightly wider, while other models remained compliant with Japanese dimension regulations. In 1981, Japanese buyers were offered an alternative to the Celica XX fastback bodystyle, called the Toyota Soarer coupe, which was offered at a different Japanese Toyota dealership network called the Toyota Store, as the Celica XX was sold at the Toyota Corolla Store. The four-door performance sedan offered by the Celica Camry was realigned with the Japanese market Toyota Chaser, while in North America the Toyota Cressida took on that role.|$|E

2500|$|In 2009, {{subsequent}} to Toyota releasing the Trail Teams Special Edition FJ Cruiser for the <b>production</b> <b>year</b> of 2008, Toyota created the TRD package. This package was available on FJ Cruisers with the iceberg white monotone exterior color scheme, {{similar to the}} 2008 Trail Teams Special Editions, except without the addition of blacked-out trim pieces. Even though this package {{was known as the}} [...] "TRD package", it did not include the same or as many features as the TRD Special Edition. Some of the features with this package were the TRD alloy wheels in a silver finish with the BFGoodrich all-terrain tires, as well as TRD logos and graphics on the exterior. Also, the TRD package was only offered on units with two-wheel drive for the 2008 [...] and 2009 model years. Since 2011, Toyota offered the TRD package on the iceberg white FJ Cruisers but opened the package availability to both two- and four-wheel drive models. In 2009, 2,400 units were produced with the TRD package.|$|E
2500|$|The 1978 25th Anniversary model {{introduced}} the fastback glass rear window and featured a new interior and dashboard. Corvette's 25th anniversary was celebrated with the Indy 500 Pace Car limited edition and a Silver Anniversary model featuring silver over gray lower body paint. All 1979 models featured the previous year's pace car seats and offered {{the front and}} rear spoilers as optional equipment. 53,807 were produced for the model year, making 1979 the peak <b>production</b> <b>year</b> for all versions of the Corvette. Sales have trended downward since then. [...] In 1980, the Corvette received an integrated aerodynamic redesign that resulted in a significant reduction in drag. After several years of weight increases, 1980 Corvettes were lighter as engineers trimmed both body and chassis weight. In mid-1981, production shifted from St. Louis, Missouri to Bowling Green, Kentucky, and several two-tone paint options were offered. The 1981 models were the last available with a manual transmission until well into the 1984 production run. In 1982, a fuel-injected engine returned, and a final C3 tribute Collectors Edition featured an exclusive, opening rear window hatch.|$|E
2500|$|The Chevrolet {{division}} was GM's entry-level marque. Managers at GM were seriously considering shelving the project, leaving the Corvette {{to be little}} more than a footnote in automotive history, and would have done so if not for three important events. The first was the 1955 introduction of Chevrolet's first V8 engine since 1919. Late in the model year, the new [...] 265 small-block became available with a Powerglide automatic transmission, until the middle of the <b>production</b> <b>year</b> when a manual 3-speed became available, coupled to a 3.55:1 axle ratio, the only one offered. The engine was fitted with a single 2218S or 2351S WCFB four-barrel (four-choke) Carter carburetor. The combination turned the [...] "rather anemic Corvette into a credible if not outstanding performer". The second was the influence of a Russian émigré in GM's engineering department, Zora Arkus-Duntov. The third factor in the Corvette's survival was Ford's introduction of the 1955 two-seat Thunderbird, which was billed as a [...] "personal luxury car", not a sports car. Even so, the Ford-Chevrolet rivalry in those days demanded GM not appear to back down from the challenge. The original concept for the Corvette emblem incorporated an American flag into the design, but was changed well before production since associating the flag with a product was frowned upon.|$|E

[...] The separate [...] "TRIUMPH" [...] letters {{on the front of the}} bonnet were removed and [...] "TRIUMPH" [...] and [...] "SPITFIRE" [...] rectangular badges were used in the front, rear sides and rear. [...] A limited number of U.S. market 1970's were adorned with an RAF style [...] "SPITFIRE" [...] badge (U.K. models had a plain badge without the RAF roundel) that rested in the right corner (car opposing point of view) of the bonnet. Additional exterior changes introduced included a zip up rear window, black radiator grille and a black (vs body colored) windshield surround. [...] Full wheel covers of two styles were used including the 1969 introduced model with [...] "SPITFIRE" [...] circumscribing the hub and a unique derivative without the branding. [...] Interior changes included a steering column mounted ignition switch, a key-in-ignition warning buzzer, driver's side under-dash courtesy lamp and a new black spoked steering wheel. [...] Under the bonnet, some markets had the twin SU carburettors replaced with a single Zenith-Stromberg carburettor.|$|E
2500|$|Four-wheel {{disc brakes}} were {{introduced}} in 1965, as was a [...] "big block" [...] engine option: the [...] V8. Side exhaust pipes were also optionally available in 1965, and continued to be offered through 1967. The introduction of the [...] big block in 1965 spelled {{the beginning of the}} end for the Rochester fuel injection system. The [...] option cost [...] while the fuel injected [...] engine cost [...] Few people could justify spending [...] more for [...] less, even though FI could deliver over 20 mpg on the highway and would keep delivering fuel despite high G-loading in corners taken at racing speeds. [...] Another rare '63 and '64 option was the Z06 competition package, which offered stiffer suspension, bigger, multi-segment lined brakes with finned drums and more, only a couple hundred coupes and ONE convertible were factory-equipped this way in 1963. [...] With only 771 fuel-injected cars built in 1965, Chevrolet discontinued the option at the end of the '65 production, having introduced a less-expensive big block 396 engine rated at 425hp in the middle of the <b>production</b> <b>year</b> and selling over 2,000 in just a few months. For 1966, Chevrolet introduced an even larger [...] Big Block version. Other options available on the C2 included the Wonderbar auto-tuning AM radio, AM-FM radio (mid-1963), air conditioning (late-1963), a telescopic steering wheel (1965), and headrests (1966). The Sting Ray's independent rear suspension was successfully adapted for the new-for-1965 Chevrolet Corvair, which solved the quirky handling problems of that unique rear-engine compact.|$|E
2500|$|Toyota {{announced}} that the 2014 model year would be the final <b>production</b> <b>year</b> of the FJ Cruiser for the U.S. Market, therefore to add uniqueness to {{the final version of}} the Trail Teams Special Edition, Toyota designated the final version to be the Trail Teams Ultimate Edition which features a few special upgrades. The 2014 Trail Teams Ultimate Edition FJ Cruiser comes in a Heritage Blue paint scheme (resembling an original FJ40 Land Cruiser factory paint color), and for the first time features a white grille bezel that again pays tribute to the iconic Land Cruiser FJ40. The remaining vehicle trim remains black, similar to previous versions of the Trail Teams Special Edition. [...] While all of the Trail Teams FJ Cruisers feature a race-inspired TRD/Trail Teams off-road suspension designed by Bilstein, the Ultimate Edition features a new rear remote reservoir suspension. The suspension also raises the vehicle slightly taller than stock as to achieve a leveled stance. The Ultimate Edition is also equipped with a special 1/4 inch thick aluminum TRD skid plate, designed to help with the approach angle for the front of the vehicle and provide better protection while off-roading. Significant interior differences that are unique to the 2014 Trails Team Ultimate Edition include; the interior panel inserts are black rather than color matched to the exterior color of the vehicle, the radio bezel is silver, and a special [...] "Ultimate Edition" [...] dash plaque is affixed to the dash on the passenger side indicating the special edition is only [...] "One of 2500." [...] Additionally, the seating fabric inserts are color matched to coordinate with the Ultimate Edition's unique silver/black interior, rather than the exterior color as in previous years.|$|E
