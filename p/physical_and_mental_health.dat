5|$|The primary {{treatment}} of schizophrenia is antipsychotic medications, often {{in combination with}} psychological and social supports. Hospitalization may occur for severe episodes either voluntarily or (if mental health legislation allows it) involuntarily. Long-term hospitalization is uncommon since deinstitutionalization beginning in the 1950s, although it still occurs. Community support services including drop-in centers, visits by members of a community mental health team, supported employment and support groups are common. Some evidence indicates that regular exercise has {{a positive effect on}} the <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> of those with schizophrenia.|$|E

In another case the father of an eight-year-old girl with cancer approached him for help, then complained to the American Medical Association that he was practising without a licence. He asked his supporters to stick with him through the criticism, believing that he had developed a grand unified theory of <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health.</b>|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines are {{generally}} viewed as {{safe and effective}} for short-term use, although cognitive impairment and paradoxical effects such as aggression or behavioral disinhibition occasionally occur. A minority of people can have paradoxical reactions such as worsened agitation or panic. Benzodiazepines are also associated with increased risk of suicide. Long-term use is controversial {{because of concerns about}} adverse psychological and physical effects, decreasing effectiveness, and physical dependence and withdrawal. As a result of adverse effects associated with the long-term use of benzodiazepines, withdrawal from benzodiazepines often leads to improved <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health.</b> The elderly are at an increased risk of suffering from both short- and long-term adverse effects, and as a result, all benzodiazepines are listed in the Beers List of inappropriate medications for older adults.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to examine changes in function over time after injury and to identify factors associated with long-term recovery that may be amenable to change through intervention. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Intensive care in a tertiary hospital in Queensland, Australia. Patients: Adult (n = 123) admitted to intensive care for treatment of injury. Interventions: Data were collected prior to hospital discharge and 1, 6, 12, and 24 months post injury. Data included demographics, preinjury health, injury characteristics, acute care factors, psychosocial measures, and health status. Linear mixed-effects models were used to identify factors associated with <b>physical</b> function <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> over time. Measurements <b>and</b> Main Results: <b>Physical</b> function <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> improved over time; however, the averages remained below Australian norms at 24 months. Optimistic perception of illness and greater self-efficacy were potentially modifiable factors associated with improved <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> function over time. Greater perceived social support, also potentially modifiable, was associated with improved <b>mental</b> <b>health.</b> Injury insurance <b>and</b> income were significant nonmodifiable factors for <b>mental</b> <b>health,</b> with <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> gains associated with higher income. Hospital length of stay and injury insurance were nonmodifiable factors linked with physical function. Conclusions: Improvements in <b>physical</b> function <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> are evident in the 24 months following injury, but most patients remain below Australian population norms. Factors that were associated with <b>physical</b> function <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> outcomes over time that are potentially amenable to change include illness perception, self-efficacy, and perceived social support...|$|R

5|$|Disillusioned with Covent Garden, MacMillan {{accepted}} {{an invitation from}} the Deutsche Oper in Berlin to run its ballet company. Parry describes this as an unhappy experience. Though at Covent Garden Webster may sometimes have been suspected of favouring the opera {{at the expense of}} the ballet, MacMillan discovered that at the Berlin house there was no doubt that the ballet was given distinctly lower priority. He did not speak German, which reduced his enjoyment from watching films (of which he was a great devotee) and theatre and limited him generally in everyday life. Although he had taken several colleagues with him, including Seymour, many moved away over the course of his nearly four years in charge, and MacMillan became increasingly isolated. It was the first time he had been in a managerial as well as a creative role, and the strain affected his <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health.</b> He smoked and drank heavily and suffered a minor stroke.|$|E
5|$|After a time, Himmler {{found that}} the killing methods used by the Einsatzgruppen were inefficient: they were costly, demoralising for the troops, and {{sometimes}} did not kill the victims quickly enough. Many of the troops found the massacres to be difficult if not impossible to perform. Some of the perpetrators suffered <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> problems, and many turned to drink. As much as possible, the Einsatzgruppen leaders militarized the genocide. The historian Christian Ingrao notes {{an attempt was made}} to make the shootings a collective act without individual responsibility. Framing the shootings in this way was not psychologically sufficient for every perpetrator to feel absolved of guilt. Browning notes three categories of potential perpetrators: those who were eager to participate right from the start, those who participated in spite of moral qualms because they were ordered to do so, and a significant minority who refused to take part. A few men spontaneously became excessively brutal in their killing methods and their zeal for the task. Commander of Einsatzgruppe D, SS-Gruppenführer Otto Ohlendorf, particularly noted this propensity towards excess, and ordered that any man who was too eager to participate or too brutal should not perform any further executions.|$|E

5|$|The {{deepening}} {{economic crisis}} caused a marked deterioration in {{quality of life}} of ordinary citizens and resulted in increasing political instability. Rationing and queuing became a way of life, with ration cards (kartki) necessary to buy basic consumer staples. The ration cards were utilized by the government in order to avoid allowing market regulation of income and prices and thus risking social unrest. As Western institutions were no longer willing to extend credit policies to the de facto bankrupt Polish government, access to goods the Poles needed became even more restricted. Most of the available scarce resources of Western currency had to be used to pay the crushing rates on Poland's foreign debt, which reached US$27 billion by 1980 and increased to US$45 billion in 1989. The government, which controlled all official foreign trade, responded by continuing to maintain a highly artificial exchange rate with Western currencies. The exchange rate worsened distortions in the economy at all levels, resulting in a growing black market {{and the development of a}} shortage economy. The omnipresent and destructive underground economy was characterized by phenomena such as bribery, waiting lists, speculation, direct exchanges between enterprises and large percentages of personal incomes deriving from secondary activities. Societal degradation was accompanied by unprecedented deterioration in the areas of biological environment and <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health,</b> which included steadily increasing mortality rates. In the late 1980s, the PZPR feared another social explosion because of high inflation, depressed living standards and deepening public anger and frustration. The authorities themselves, facing an increasingly disorderly and unmanageable system, felt perplexed and powerless.|$|E

Gough 3 This paper reports findings from a qualitative investigation into the relationship between <b>physical</b> activity <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> from the experiences of participants on exercise referral schemes. A grounded theory methodology was adopted which used focus groups and semi-structured interviews with participants from three exercise referral schemes in England. Schemes were representative of different types within the UK, and included a local authority leisure centre, a private health club and a local authority leisure centre scheme with organized countryside hikes. Pre- and post-exercise re-ferral intervention focus groups, and interviews with purposively sampled individuals, were undertaken. Eighteen people participated and interviews were audio-taped, transcribed and analyzed. A conceptual framework emerged, and provides a psycho-social explanation for the <b>physical</b> activity <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> relation-ship {{from the perspectives of}} the participants’ who experienced it. The {{explanation of the}} relationship from this perspective identifies the core category ‘self-acceptance’, and the importance and interrelationship of context-related factors (such as social support <b>and</b> the <b>physical</b> environment), for the elicitation of positive experiences for people on exercise referral schemes. Investigating participant’s experiences within the social contexts of exer-cise referral schemes provides an understand-ing about whether schemes have the potential to influence the <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> of referred patients...|$|R

40|$|Background Multimorbidity, the {{presence}} of more than 1 long-term disorder, is associated with increased use of health services, but unplanned admissions to hospital may often be undesirable. Furthermore, socioeconomic deprivation <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> comorbidity may lead to additional unplanned admissions.
