With the deployment of mass scale 3 G just around the corner, new directions are already being researched. In this paper we address about the 4 TH G mobile communications. The Fourth Generation (4 G) Mobile Communications should not focus only on the data-rate increase and new air interface. 4 G Mobile should instead con-verge the advanced wireless mobile communications and high-speed wireless access systems into an Open Wireless Architecture (OWA) platform which becomes the core of this emerging next generation mobile technology.

The expectations from 4 G are high in terms of data rates, spectral efficiency, mobility and integration. Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is proving to be a possible multiple access technology to be used in 4 G.
