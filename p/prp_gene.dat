However, any such splicing factor containing the helicase motifs in vertebrates has not been identified. To identify human homologs of this family, we designed PCR primers corresponding to the highly conserved region of the DEAH box protein family and successfully amplified five cDNA fragments, using HeLa poly(A) + RNA as a substrate.

Expression of HRH 1 in a S. cerevisiae prp 22 mutant can partially rescue its temperature-sensitive phenotype.

Interestingly, HRH 1 but not Prp 22 contains an arginine- and serine-rich domain (RS domain) which is characteristic of some splicing factors, such as members of the SR protein family.

40|$|Abstract Background Cellular {{prion protein}} {{expression}} {{is essential for}} the development of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), and in sheep, genetic susceptibility to scrapie has been associated to <b>PrP</b> <b>gene</b> polymorphisms. To test the hypothetical linkage between <b>PrP</b> <b>gene</b> expression and genetic susceptibility, PrP mRNA levels were measured by real-time RT-PCR in six ovine tissues of animals with different genotypes. Results Previous to the <b>PrP</b> <b>gene</b> expression analysis the stability of several housekeeping (HK) genes was assessed in order to select the best ones for relative quantification. The normalisation of gene expression was carried out using a minimum of three HK genes in order to detect small expression differences more accurately than using a single control gene. The expression stability analysis of six HK genes showed a large tissue-associated variation reflecting the existence of tissue-specific factors. Thereby, a specific set of HK genes was required for an accurate normalisation of the <b>PrP</b> <b>gene</b> expression within each tissue. Statistical differences in the normalised PrP mRNA levels were found among the tissues, obtaining the highest expression level in obex, followed by ileum, lymph node, spleen, cerebellum and cerebrum. A tendency towards increased PrP mRNA levels and genetic susceptibility was observed in central nervous system. However, the results did not support the hypothesis that PrP mRNA levels vary between genotypes. Conclusion The results on <b>PrP</b> <b>gene</b> expression presented here provide valuable baseline data for future studies on scrapie pathogenesis. On the other hand, the results on stability data of several HK genes reported in this study could prove very useful in other gene expression studies carried out in these relevant ovine tissues. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background: Existing {{mathematical}} {{models for}} scrapie dynamics in sheep populations {{assume that the}} <b>PrP</b> <b>gene</b> is only associated with scrapie susceptibility and with no other fitness related traits. This assumption contrasts recent findings of <b>PrP</b> <b>gene</b> associations with post-natal lamb survival in scrapie free Scottish Blackface populations. Lambs with scrapie resistant genotypes {{were found to have}} significantly lower survival rates than those with susceptible genotypes. The present study aimed to investigate how these conflicting <b>PrP</b> <b>gene</b> associations may affect the dynamic patterns of PrP haplotype frequencies and disease prevalence. Methodology/Principal Findings: A deterministic mathematical model was developed to explore how the associations between PrP genotype and both scrapie susceptibility and postnatal lamb mortality affect the prevalence of scrapie and the associated change in <b>PrP</b> <b>gene</b> frequencies in a closed flock of sheep. The model incorporates empirical evidence on epidemiological and biological characteristics of scrapie and on mortality rates induced by causes other than scrapie. The model results indicate that unfavorable associations of the scrapie resistant PrP haplotypes with post-natal lamb mortality, if sufficiently strong, can increase scrapie prevalence during an epidemic, and result in scrapie persisting in the population. The range of model parameters, for which such effects were observed, is realistic but relatively narrow.

40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of the prion protein (<b>PrP)</b> <b>gene</b> more than a decade ago, transgenetic investigations on the <b>PrP</b> <b>gene</b> have shaped the field of prion biology in an unprecedented way. Many questions regarding the role of PrP in susceptibility of an organism exposed to prions have been elucidated. For example mice with a targeted disruption of the <b>PrP</b> <b>gene</b> have allowed the demonstration that an organism that lacks PrPc is resistant to infection by prions. Reconstitution of these mice with mutant PrP genes allowed investigations on the structure-activity relationship of the <b>PrP</b> <b>gene</b> with regard to scrapie susceptibility.

The objectives of this study were to determine the effectiveness of predicting PrP genotypes by using information from relatives and to investigate the {{association of}} the PrP genotype with lamb performance traits in Suffolk sheep. Data were obtained from a scrapie-affected flock maintained in Scotland. A total of 643 were animals genotyped at codon 171 of the <b>PrP</b> <b>gene</b> with 2 alleles, R and Q. The genotypes of these animals were used to predict the genotypes of 5, 173 nongenotyped animals in the same flock using segregation analysis. The genotype of nongenotyped animals was predicted from the probabilities for each possible genotype; further, an overall index for each animal was calculated to reflect the accuracy of prediction. Association analyses of the <b>PrP</b> <b>gene</b> (using animals with both known and inferred genotypes) with BW at birth, at weaning (56 d), and at 150 d, and for backfat and muscle depths at 150 d of age were carried out. A linear mixed model with random direct and maternal additive genetic effects, maternal permanent and temporary environmental effects, and year of birth was tested, and the most appropriate model was used for each trait. The expected number of Q alleles carried (from 0 to 2) by each animal was calculated and used in the model as a linear and quadratic covariate to test for associations with possible additive and dominance <b>PrP</b> <b>gene</b> effects, respectively. Results showed that the genotypes of relatively few animals (235) were inferred with certainty (compared with the 5, 173 nongenotyped animals).
