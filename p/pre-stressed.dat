40|$|To {{evaluate}} the <b>pre-stress</b> in the menisci {{of a human}} knee joint, the technique of microindentation was adopted. Five specimens each for lateral and medial menisci attached to the tibia were prepared from the knee joints of Korean cadavers to represent the <b>pre-stress</b> state of the meniscus. To create test specimens for the stress-free state of the meniscus, each meniscus was resected from the tibia and cut into three parts, which were subsequently attached to a metal plate. Indentations were carried out in each meniscus in both the <b>pre-stress</b> state and the stress-free state. The <b>pre-stresses</b> in the menisci were evaluated using the load-versus-depth curves.

40|$|<b>Pre-stress</b> {{degradation}} or looseness of rock bolts in mining or tunnel engineering {{threatens the}} stability and reliability of the structures. In this paper, an innovative piezoelectric device named a “smart washer” with the impedance method is proposed {{with the aim of}} developing a real-time device to monitor the <b>pre-stress</b> level of rock bolts. The proposed method was verified through tests on a rock bolt specimen. By applying high-frequency sweep excitations (typically > 30 kHz) to the smart washer that was installed on the rock bolt specimen, we observed that the variation in impedance signatures indicated the rock bolt <b>pre-stress</b> status. With the degradation of rock bolt <b>pre-stress,</b> the frequency in the dominating peak of the real part of the electrical impedance signature increased. To quantify the effectiveness of the proposed technique, a normalized root mean square deviation (RMSD) index was developed to evaluate the degradation level of the rock bolt <b>pre-stress.</b> The experimental results demonstrated that the normalized RMSD-based looseness index, which was computed from the impedance value detected by the “smart washer”, increased with loss of the <b>pre-stress</b> of the rock bolt.

40|$|This work investigates {{theoretically}} the phonon {{property and}} thermal conductivity of rectangular silicon nanowires under <b>pre-stress</b> and surface stress. In {{the framework of}} elasticity theory, the effects of spatial confinement are considered in the phonon dispersion relation of a stressed nanowire. The surface energy, which brings about the variation of the elastic modulus of nanowire and the influence on the phonon property, is then involved. Under a <b>pre-stress</b> field, the acoustoelastic effect {{gives rise to the}} change of phonon properties and thermal conductivity. Our numerical results demonstrate that the applied surface stress and <b>pre-stress</b> field can alter the phonon dispersion relation of a silicon nanowire significantly. The phonon energy increases if the surface stress is negative and the <b>pre-stress</b> is positive, and vice versa. The changes of phonon dispersion relation as well as the various phonon scattering rates lead to the variation of phonon thermal conductivity, which is the consequence of the surface stress and <b>pre-stress</b> fields. We further elaborate the size and temperature dependence of phonon thermal conductivity under different applied surface stresses and <b>pre-stress</b> fields and suggest using the strain engineering to tune the thermal performance of semiconductor nanostructures.

25|$|In many areas, regular {{avalanche}} tracks can {{be identified}} and precautions {{can be taken to}} minimise damage, such as the prevention of development in these areas. To mitigate the effect of avalanches the construction of artificial barriers can be very effective in reducing avalanche damage. There are several types: One kind of barrier (snow net) uses a net strung between poles that are anchored by guy wires in addition to their foundations. These barriers are similar to those used for rockslides. Another type of barrier is a rigid fence-like structure (snow fence) and may be constructed of steel, wood or <b>pre-stressed</b> concrete. They usually have gaps between the beams and are built perpendicular to the slope, with reinforcing beams on the downhill side. Rigid barriers are often considered unsightly, especially when many rows must be built. They are also expensive and vulnerable to damage from falling rocks in the warmer months. In addition to industrially manufactured barriers, landscaped barriers, called avalanche dams stop or deflect avalanches with their weight and strength. These barriers are made out of concrete, rocks or earth. They are usually placed right above the structure, road or railway that they are trying to protect, although they {{can also be used to}} channel avalanches into other barriers. Occasionally, earth mounds are placed in the avalanche's path to slow it down. Finally, along transportation corridors, large shelters, called snow sheds, can be built directly in the slide path of an avalanche to protect traffic from avalanches.|$|E

A linear bifurcation analysis is carried out using different structural models (namely a double beam, a rectangular thin plate, and a hyper-elastic prismatic solid in 3 -d) : it yields the buckling mode and the wavenumber q c that are first encountered when the end-to-end displacement is progressively decreased with fixed <b>pre-stress.</b> For all three structural models, we find a transition from a long-wavelength (q c = 0) to a short-wavelength first buckling mode (q c = 0) when the inhomogeneous <b>pre-stress</b> is increased past a critical value.
