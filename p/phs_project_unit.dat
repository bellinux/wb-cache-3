The specific question this paper asks is how collaborative <b>Ph.</b> D. <b>projects</b> perform compared to non-collaborative <b>Ph.</b> D. <b>projects.</b> Conducting an empirical study on 448 <b>Ph.</b> D. <b>projects</b> at Eindhoven University of Technology, it is observed that collaborative <b>Ph.</b> D. <b>projects</b> outperform non-collaborative <b>Ph.</b> D. <b>projects</b> both in terms of industrial performance (number of patents and patent citations) and academic performance (number of publications and publication citations). A further investigation indicates that the high performance of collaborative <b>Ph.</b> D. <b>projects</b> is specific to the university׳s collaborations with Philips and with Public Research Organisations. When measuring academic performance is a more restricted manner by looking at top-publications only, it is observed that collaborative <b>Ph.</b> D. <b>projects</b> no longer outperform non-collaborative <b>Ph.</b> D. <b>projects.</b> One of the policy implications {{of this study is that}} there seems to be no reasons for universities to be reserved to enter into collaborative <b>Ph.</b> D. <b>projects,</b> when such opportunities arise...|$|R

40|$|Welfare in {{the future}} is {{something}} that all people dreamed, including goverment employees. As a government's concern for welfare {{in the future}} for the goverment employees so the government give pension program. The pension program will give pension benefit to the goverment employees on their retirement age. Pension funding requires actuarial computation which normal cost and actuarial liability. Actuarial computation is divided into two major parts, Accrued Benefit Cost Method and Projected Benefit Cost Method. One of Accrued Benefit Cost Method example is <b>Projected</b> <b>Unit</b> Credit and for the Projected Benefit cost one of the method is Attained Age Normal. This research uses secondary data from PT. TASPEN (Persero) KCU Semarang. Computation result shows on the both second normal cost the method tends to increase each year. <b>Projected</b> <b>Unit</b> Credit Method exhibits substansial increment, meanwhile on Attained Age Nornal Method the increment is relatively slow. The amount of both second actuarial liability method will always increase each year, by using Attained Age Normal Cost produces bigger actuarial liability than <b>Projected</b> <b>Unit</b> Credit Method. <b>Projected</b> <b>Unit</b> Credit Method give final normal cost less than Attained Age Nornal Method.

40|$|One {{effort to}} {{anticipate}} the risk of old age is to include every worker in a pension plan. From that pension plan, workers will get a pension benefit at retirement. Before reaching retirement age, {{there should be an}} actuarial cost, which includes the normal cost and actuarial liabilities. Both are calculated using actuarial cost methods. Actuarial cost methods are divided into two major categories, are Accrued Benefit Cost Method and Projected Benefit Cost Method. One example of the methods included in Accrued Benefit Cost Method is <b>Projected</b> <b>Unit</b> Credit Method, and one of the methods included in Projected Benefit Cost Method is Entry Age Normal Method. The data used in this thesis are secondary data from PT Taspen (Persero) KCU Semarang. The results of the calculation shows normal cost using <b>Projected</b> <b>Unit</b> Credit method continues to increase with increased salary. Whereas if using Entry Age Normal Method the same amount for each year on an employee. Besides, actuarial liability using <b>Projected</b> <b>Unit</b> Credit Method is smaller than using Entry Age Normal for each employee in each year...|$|R
