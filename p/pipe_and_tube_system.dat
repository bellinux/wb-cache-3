These robotic systems assist human to monitor and explore various types of spaces and measure physical parameters of these spaces. Each individual robot can be equipped with 3 D ceramic-packaged multi-purpose sensors/actuators, smart navigation systems, and reconfìgurable high-speed wireless communication networking. The targeted applications are realtime monitoring/rescuing in various kinds of harmful environments e. g. deep mines, <b>pipe</b> <b>and</b> <b>tube</b> <b>systems,</b> dramatically reducing risk of life and economic damage...|$|R

50|$|In 1880, Potts Brothers Iron Company Ltd., which owned {{a rolling}} mill in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, {{acquired}} a controlling {{interest in the}} Chester <b>Pipe</b> <b>and</b> <b>Tube</b> Company. Colonel Joseph D.

50|$|Annular cutters {{can also}} be best used to make holes in <b>pipes</b> <b>and</b> <b>tubes.</b> Annular cutters help make holes in <b>pipe</b> <b>and</b> <b>tubes</b> without {{dimpling}} <b>and</b> deburring. Unlike the conventional method of bringing the workpiece to machine, {{with the help of}} portable magnetic core drilling machines, you can now bring the machine to the workpiece. This makes the drilling process on tubes very easy.|$|R

25|$|A slab is {{a length}} of metal that is {{rectangular}} in cross-section. It is created directly by continuous casting or indirectly by rolling an ingot on a slabbing mill. Slabs are usually further processed via flat rolling, skelping, <b>and</b> <b>pipe</b> rolling. Common final products include sheet metal, plates, strip metal, <b>pipes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>tubes.</b>|$|R
50|$|In June 1899, the Chester <b>Pipe</b> <b>and</b> <b>Tube</b> Company was {{consolidated}} with twenty other pipemaking {{firms in}} the northeastern United States to form the National Tube Company.

50|$|The {{hoop stress}} {{equation}} for thin shells is also approximately valid for spherical vessels, including plant cells and bacteria {{in which the}} internal turgor pressure may reach several atmospheres.

5000|$|Generally, {{round stock}} {{is what is}} used in tube bending. However, square <b>and</b> {{rectangular}} <b>tubes</b> <b>and</b> <b>pipes</b> may also be bent to meet job specifications. Other factors involved in the tube bending process is the wall thickness, tooling and lubricants needed by the <b>pipe</b> <b>and</b> <b>tube</b> bender to best shape the material {{and it is also}} used in different ways e.g.( [...] tube,pipe wires).|$|R
5|$|The {{most common}} gas welding process is oxyfuel welding, {{also known as}} {{oxyacetylene}} welding. It {{is one of the}} oldest and most versatile welding processes, but in recent years it has become less popular in industrial applications. It is still widely used for welding <b>pipes</b> <b>and</b> <b>tubes,</b> as well as repair work.|$|R

She finds {{a chair in the}} spare bedroom, with <b>pipes</b> <b>and</b> <b>tubes</b> running into the floor and a {{headpiece}} above it. She goes back downstairs, following the <b>pipes,</b> <b>and</b> finds a door. She hears Barinska come in, and sees her go to the upstairs spare room, sit on the chair and become young again.|$|R
25|$|Brazing is the {{preferred}} method for joining <b>pipe</b> <b>and</b> <b>tube</b> copper alloys. Copper metal sections are joined with a non-ferrous filler material with a melting point above 800 degrees Fahrenheit but below the melting point of the base metals. Blind or concealed joints are recommended since the color match of silver filler material is fair to poor.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two types}} of pipe cutters. Plastic tubing cutters, which really look much like a pair of pruning shears, may be used for thinner <b>pipes</b> <b>and</b> <b>tubes,</b> such as {{sprinkler}} pipe. For use on thicker pipes, there is a pipecutter with a sharp wheel and adjustable jaw grips. These are used by rotating it around the <b>pipe</b> <b>and</b> repeatedly tightening it until it cuts all of the way through.|$|R
50|$|Internal rotary {{inspection}} system (IRIS) is an ultrasonic method for the nondestructive testing of <b>pipes</b> <b>and</b> <b>tubes.</b> The IRIS probe is inserted into a tube that is flooded with water, and the probe is pulled out slowly as {{the data is}} displayed and recorded. The ultrasonic beam allows detection of metal loss from the {{inside and outside of}} the tube wall.|$|R
50|$|Plumbing {{hardware}} products {{are used for}} supplying water throughout the building using hose, <b>pipes</b> <b>and</b> <b>tubes.</b> These {{hardware products}} ensure that water is supplied properly and continuously. Since water runs or remains {{all the time in}} these products, it is needed that the materials with which these products are highly corrosion resistant and can withstand extreme temperatures. The most common materials are copper, aluminum, steel and PVC.|$|R

In 2004, Pinchuk and Rinat Akhmetov, two of Ukraine's richest men, acquired the Kryvorizhstal steel factory for about $800 million. [...] Later, the first Tymoshenko Government reversed this sale, and held a nationally-televised repeat auction that netted $4.8 billion. In 2006, Pinchuk founded an investment advisory company, EastOne. Its portfolio includes industrial assets such as production of <b>pipes</b> <b>and</b> <b>tubes,</b> rail car wheels, specialty steels and alloys, machinery, as well as media.|$|R
50|$|Founded in Schaffhausen, Switzerland in 1960, the GF Pipe Coupling Technology {{division}} {{focused on}} the production of <b>pipe</b> <b>and</b> <b>tube</b> cutting, facing, <b>and</b> beveling machines for high purity process piping.

50|$|Remote {{field testing}} (RFT) is an {{electromagnetic}} method of nondestructive testing whose main application is finding defects in steel <b>pipes</b> <b>and</b> <b>tubes.</b> RFT may {{also referred to}} as RFEC (remote field eddy current) or RFET (remote field electromagnetic technique). An RFT probe is moved down the inside of a <b>pipe</b> <b>and</b> is able to detect inside and outside defects with approximately equal sensitivity (although it can not discriminate between the two). Although RFT works in nonferromagnetic materials such as copper and brass, its sister technology eddy-current testing is preferred.|$|R
