30|$|Overall, the {{two samples}} of bipolar {{patients}} derived from Argentina and the United States differed significantly {{not only in}} terms of demographic characteristics but also in terms of clinical features. Despite the similar sample sizes, the Argentinian sample had many more unfavorable demographic characteristics, including lower marriage rates and less years of education. It is worth noting that almost 20 % of individuals had not completed primary education. Such low levels of education may warrant a more careful examination of the effects of bipolar disorder on the attainment and sustainment educational opportunities, as well as further development of programs to support social engagement for individuals with severe mental illness. However, when a cumulative measure of social outcome was computed, the Argentinian sample demonstrated a more favorable social outcome. A recent study found that married women with bipolar disorder had lower cumulative illness severity and fewer prior mood episodes than never-married women with bipolar disorder, suggesting that patients may be sensitive to the beneficial effects of social support (Lieberman et al. 2010). As such, <b>promoting</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>social</b> environment for individuals with bipolar may support positive therapeutic outcomes.|$|E

40|$|Provisioning Internet {{services}} {{remains an}} area of concern for Internet service providers. Despite investments to improve resources and technology, the understanding of sociotechnical factors that influence the service-provisioning life cycle remains limited. The purpose of this case study was to evaluate the influence of sociotechnical factors associated with telecom service provisioning and to explore the critical success and failure factors, specifically in the telecommunication industry of Kuwait. Guided by sociotechnical systems theory, this qualitative exploratory case study approach examined a purposeful sample of 19 participants comprising of managers, engineers, and technicians who had the knowledge and experience of the service-provisioning life cycle. Semistructured interviews, project logs, and a self-created follow-up questionnaire were the primary sources of data. Thematic analysis techniques assisted in coding the data and developing themes, {{which resulted in a}} set of critical success and failure factors that influence the service-provisioning life cycle. Cross-functional communication, risk management practices, infrastructure availability, and employee skill development were among the emergent factors that influenced the service implementation. Internet service providers may use the results from this study to improve the service-provisioning life cycle. Successful implementations will <b>promote</b> <b>an</b> environment of <b>positive</b> <b>social</b> change that will increase employee motivation, productivity, and employee morale...|$|R
40|$|Empirical {{data have}} not {{adequately}} revealed current methods of nonprofit leadership {{in a way}} that reflects shared leadership in the nonprofit sector leaving nonprofit organizations (NPOs) at a disadvantage in relation to understanding and describing leadership effectiveness. Using a conceptual framework that incorporated organizational theory, shared leadership theory, path goal theory, transformational theory, leader member exchange, and fund development theory, this mini ethnographic study was conducted to explore the effect of leadership styles in shared leadership situations and the impact of matched and unmatched leadership styles on NPO funding performance. With the use of purposeful sampling to conduct the study, the participants represented 5 community partner NPOs in the New York City area with 20 or fewer employees and average annual funding of $ 600, 000 or more during the previous 3 years. The data analysis of interviews, observation, journaling, member checking, and document review and analysis were performed through hand coding using an inductive analytical method to identify patterns and themes. The study results indicate that matching leadership styles of executive and senior leaders such as leader member exchange and path-goal development are directly related to a team-oriented culture that is essential for the longevity and effective performance of non-profit organizations. Based on the findings, shared leadership <b>promotes</b> <b>a</b> culture of <b>positive</b> <b>social</b> change through building honesty and integrity, which in turn can help nonprofit organizational leaders improve funding programs and stakeholder interest. Ultimately shared leadership benefits the social needs of society by enhancing the services to the beneficiaries who receive the NPO programs...|$|R
