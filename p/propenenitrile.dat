40|$|Reactions of photoexcited 1, 2 -dicarbonyl {{compounds}} with chirally labelled and unlabelled captodative alkenes {{have been}} investigated, with {{special emphasis on}} their diastereoselection in cycloadditions. Irradiation of methyl phenylglyoxylate in presence of unlabelled alkenes yields to the corresponding rel-(2 R, 3 R) -head-to-head-oxetanes. Using the chirally labelled (S) -(methoxymethylpiperidinyl) <b>propenenitrile</b> gives rise to two oxetanes, {{one of which was}} isolated and identified as (2 R, 3 R) -head-to-head-oxetane by X-ray cristallography. Additionally, the photoreduction product meso-dimethyl- 2, 3 -diphenyltartrate of the ester was formed in all reactions. The photoreactions of benziles with chirally labelled c,d-alkenes give rise to oxetanes in low yields, in these cases the products of Norrish type I reactions become competitive...|$|E

Inverse electron demand Diels-Alder (IEDDA) -elimination-IEDDA generates isomeric tetracycles 15 a-d and 16 a-d. Instead, IEDDA-elimination-intramolecular elimination reactions provides xanthone 17 or 2 -hydroxybenzophenones 18 a-d, respectively. In non-polar solvents <b>propenenitriles</b> 12 and 13 experience a third alternative domino sequence: IEDDA-elimination-ene reaction, yielding the highly functionalized tricyclic compounds 21 and 22...|$|R
40|$|The photocycloadditions of 2 -(dialkylamino) <b>propenenitriles</b> to 1 -acetylnaphthalene in d 6 benzene as solvent {{proceed with}} high {{directional}} selectivity by fast and photoreversible formation of [2 + 2]-cycloadducts (tetrahydrocyclobuta[a]naphthalenes) {{followed by a}} slower and photoirreversible formation of [4 + 2]-cycloadducts (1, 4 -dihydro- 1, 4 -ethanonaphthalenes). With increasing duration of irradiation the product pattern is shifted towards a mixture of diastereomeric [4 + 2]-adducts in which the isomer with endo-orientation of the dialkylamino group in the ethano bridge is predominating. The endo-[4 + 2]-adduct of 2 -(dipropylamino) -propenenitrile to 1 -acetylnaphthalene was isolated in pure form, and its configuration was unambiguously corroborated by a single crystal X-ray structure analysis. Upon thermal activation it is converted in a small fraction via an intermediate biradical to the thermodyna-mically more stable exo-epimer before it is decomposed to the educts. Methyl 1 -naphthoate reacts {{in the same way}} as 1 -acetylnaphthalene but less efficiently...|$|R
