50|$|Microcins are all RiPPs {{produced}} by Enterobacteriaceae with a molecular weight <10 kDa. Many {{members of other}} RiPP families, such as microcin B17 (LAP) and microcin J25 (Lasso peptide) are also considered microcins. Instead of being classified based on posttranslational modifications or modifying enzymes, microcins are instead identified by molecular weight, native producer, and antibacterial activity. Microcins are either plasmid- or chromosome-encoded, but specifically have activity against Enerobacteriaceae. Because these organisms are also often producers of microcins, the gene cluster contains not only a precursor peptide and modification enzymes, but also a self-immunity gene to protect the <b>producing</b> <b>strain,</b> and genes encoding export of the natural product.|$|E

5000|$|Penicillin G is {{the drug}} of choice, {{although}} there have been some isolates found to show resistance. [...] C. canimorsus is susceptible to ampicillin, third generation cephalosporins, tetracyclines, clindamycin, and chloramphenicol. It has shown resistance to gentamicin. [...] Treatment is recommended for a minimum of three weeks. [...] Hospitalization is required in more severe infections. For cases of septicemia, high doses of penicillin are required. C. canimorsus is susceptible to clindamycin. [...] To control DIC, a condition often associated with sepsis, plasmaphoresis (separation and removal of blood plasma from blood cells) and/or leukapheresis (removal of excess white blood cells) are often utilized. Third generation cephalosporins are often given prior to diagnosis because they cover a broad range of Gram-negative bacteria. After diagnosis, provided the strain is not beta-lactamase producing, medication should be switched to penicilin G. Presumably penicillin G could be given with a beta-lactamase inhibitor combination, such as Unasyn, for patients with a beta-lactamase <b>producing</b> <b>strain.</b>|$|E
50|$|Volatile acidity test verifies {{if there}} is any steam distillable acids in the wine. Mainly present is acetic acid (the {{dominant}} component of vinegar), but lactic, butyric, propionic, and formic acid can also be found. Usually the test checks for these acids in a cash still, but there are other methods available such as HPLC, gas chromatography and enzymatic methods. The amount of volatile acidity found in sound grapes is negligible, because it is a by-product of microbial metabolism. Because acetic acid bacteria require oxygen to grow, eliminating any air in wine containers as well as addition of sulfur dioxide will limit their growth. Rejecting moldy grapes also prevents possible problems associated with acetic acid bacteria. Use of sulfur dioxide and inoculation with a low-V.A. <b>producing</b> <b>strain</b> of Saccharomyces may deter acetic acid producing yeast. A relatively new method for removal of volatile acidity from a wine is reverse osmosis. Blending may also help—a wine with high V.A. can be filtered (to remove the microbe responsible) and blended with a low V.A. wine, so that the acetic acid level is below the sensory threshold.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Microcystis aeruginosa is {{a species}} of {{cyanobacteria}} commonly found {{in a number of}} countries and frequently related to animal poisoning episodes due to its capacity to produce the cyanotoxin known as microcystin. Despite vast literature on microcystin structures and their deleterious effects, little is known about its synthesis by cyanobacteria. Therefore, this study used proteomic tools to compare two M. aeruginosa strains, contrasting them for microcystin production. Results 2 -DE gels were performed and 30 differential protein spots were chosen. Among them, 11 protein spots were unique in the toxin <b>producing</b> <b>strain</b> and 8 in the non-toxin <b>producing</b> <b>strain,</b> and 14 protein spots were shown on both 2 -DE gels but expressed differently in intensity. Around 57 % of the tandem mass spectrometry identified proteins were related to energy metabolism, with these proteins being up-regulated in the toxin <b>producing</b> <b>strain.</b> Conclusions These data suggest that the presence of higher quantities of metabolic enzymes could be related to microcystin metabolism in comparison to the non-toxin <b>producing</b> <b>strain.</b> Moreover, it was suggested that the production of microcystin could also be related to other proteins than those directly involved in its production, such as the enzymes involved in the Calvin cycle and glycolysis. </p...|$|E

These experiments demonstrated that no apparent advantage resulted from the ability to synthesize a rhizopine, whereas the ability to catabolize rhizopine provided a clear advantage when an organism was in competition with a strain without this ability.
