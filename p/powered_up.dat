5|$|Critics praised Mega Man for {{its overall}} design, though {{the game was}} not a {{commercial}} success. Mega Man established many of the gameplay, story, and graphical conventions that define the ensuing sequels, subseries, and spin-offs. The game has since been included in game compilations and rereleased on mobile phones, console emulation services. It received a full 3D remake titled Mega Man <b>Powered</b> <b>Up</b> in 2006.|$|E
5|$|A timer {{ensured that}} the bomb would not explode until at least fifteen seconds after release, one-quarter of the {{predicted}} fall time, to ensure safety of the aircraft. The timer was activated when the electrical pull-out plugs connecting it to the airplane pulled loose as the bomb fell, switching it to internal (24V battery) power and starting the timer. At {{the end of the}} 15 seconds, the radar altimeters were <b>powered</b> <b>up</b> and responsibility was passed to the barometric stage.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{original}} game, Maverick Hunter X has received very positive reviews from critics, accumulating aggregate scores of 82% on GameRankings and 79 out of 100 on Metacritic. Although the game {{did not meet}} sales expectations, it was later made available as a download from the PlayStation Network. The Japanese and North American versions were also bundled in a special compilation with Mega Man <b>Powered</b> <b>Up,</b> a remake of {{the original}} Mega Man.|$|E

5|$|Mission specialists Jerry Ross and Bill McArthur {{inspected}} the spacesuits they would don should a spacewalk become necessary during the mating or docking operations. Following the space suit inspection, Mission Specialist Chris Hadfield <b>powered</b> <b>up</b> the orbiter's robot arm {{in preparation for}} the next day's transfer of the docking module over to Atlantiss docking system. All systems affiliated with the robot arm operated as expected and were ready to support the mating.|$|E
5|$|One {{issue that}} led to {{accidents}} with the CFM56-3C engine was the failure of fan blades. This mode of failure led to the Kegworth air disaster in 1989, which killed 47 people and injured 74 more. After the fan blade failed, the pilots mistakenly shut down the wrong engine, resulting in the damaged engine failing completely when <b>powered</b> <b>up</b> for the final approach. Following the Kegworth accident, CFM56 engines fitted to a Dan-Air 737-400 and a British Midland 737-400 suffered fan blade failures under similar conditions; neither incident resulted in a crash or injuries. After the second incident, the 737-400 fleet was grounded.|$|E
5|$|The {{contamination}} caused what {{is known}} as a hard alpha inclusion, where a contaminant particle in a metal alloy causes the metal around it to become brittle. The brittle titanium around the impurity then cracked during forging and fell out during final machining, leaving a cavity with microscopic cracks at the edges. For the next 18 years, the cracks all grew slightly each time the engine was <b>powered</b> <b>up</b> and brought to operating temperature and finally broke open, causing the disk to fail.|$|E
50|$|To {{assist the}} player in his fight, many <b>power</b> <b>ups</b> are available. <b>Power</b> <b>ups</b> are hidden in small asteroids {{in the first}} stage of the game, and gray boxes in the second stage. <b>Power</b> <b>ups</b> appear in the same cycle, whether the player {{collects}} them or not.|$|R

5|$|The {{official}} mission countdown {{began on}} Monday, April 10, 1972, at 8:30 AM, six {{days before the}} launch. At this point the Saturn V rocket's three stages were <b>powered</b> <b>up</b> and drinking water was pumped into the spacecraft. As the countdown began, the crew of Apollo 16 was participating in final training exercises {{in anticipation of a}} launch on April 16. The astronauts underwent their final preflight physical examination on April 11. On April 15, liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants were pumped into the spacecraft, while the astronauts rested in anticipation of their launch the next day.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the reactor}} itself {{commenced}} in February 1944. Watched by Compton, Matthias, DuPont's Crawford Greenewalt, Leona Woods and Fermi, who inserted the first slug, the reactor was <b>powered</b> <b>up</b> beginning on 13 September 1944. Over {{the next few}} days, 838 tubes were loaded and the reactor went critical. Shortly after midnight on 27 September, the operators began to withdraw the control rods to initiate production. At first all appeared well but around 03:00 the power level started to drop and by 06:30 the reactor had shut down completely. The cooling water was investigated {{to see if there}} was a leak or contamination. The next day the reactor started up again, only to shut down once more.|$|E
5|$|Groundbreaking on the MAR-I site {{started in}} March 1963 and {{construction}} proceeded rapidly. The radar was <b>powered</b> <b>up</b> {{for the first}} time in June 1964 and achieved its first successful tracking on 11 September 1964, repeatedly tracking and breaking lock on a balloon target over a 50-minute period. However, the system demonstrated very low reliability in the transmitter's travelling wave tube (TWT) amplifiers, which led to an extremely expensive re-design and re-installation. Once upgraded, MAR-I demonstrated the system would work as expected; it could generate multiple virtual radar beams, could simultaneously generate different types of beams for detection, tracking, and discrimination at the same time, and had the accuracy and speed needed to generate many tracks.|$|E

50|$|The player, {{piloting}} {{an airplane}} fighter, {{begins with a}} single gun (as with most scrolling shooters) and can <b>power</b> <b>up</b> by collecting <b>power</b> <b>ups</b> dropped by certain colored enemies. The <b>power</b> <b>ups</b> can add a ship to the fighter's left and right sides and increase shot power and range. They can also drop bombs, which can wipe out all weak enemies on screen and do massive damage to stronger enemies.|$|R
50|$|Access {{to console}} ODT is {{obtained}} either from <b>power</b> <b>up</b> (with appropriate <b>power</b> <b>up</b> mode selected), by {{the execution of}} a HALT instruction in kernel mode, or by use of the front panel halt switch or button.|$|R
5|$|The reactor was <b>powered</b> <b>up</b> successfully, {{but after}} a few hours the power level dropped and the reactor shut down. Leona speculated that a water leak was the problem, rather than a {{radioactive}} poison. However, during the night the operators were able to power the reactor up again only to have it once more die away. The timings now pointed to a radioactive poison. After working through the numbers with slide rules and hand calculators, they determined the Neutron cross section of the poison, {{which turned out to be}} xenon-135. Fortunately, the DuPont engineers had equipped the reactor with 50 per cent more fuel tubes that the physicists had called for, and by loading them up, they managed to get the reactor started.|$|E
5|$|Rebecca Lansing, a TriOptimum {{counter-terrorism}} consultant, contacts {{the player}} and claims that Citadel Station's mining laser is being <b>powered</b> <b>up</b> to attack Earth. SHODAN's {{plan is to}} destroy all major cities on the planet, {{in a bid to}} become a kind of god. Rebecca says that a certain crew member knows how to deactivate the laser, and promises to destroy the records of the hacker's incriminating exchange with Diego if the strike is stopped. With information gleaned from log discs, the hacker destroys the laser by firing it into Citadel Station's own shields. Foiled by the hacker's work, SHODAN prepares to seed Earth with a mutagenic virus—the same one responsible for turning the station's crew into mutants. The hacker, while attempting to jettison the chambers used to cultivate the virus, confronts and defeats Diego, who has been transformed into a powerful cyborg by SHODAN. Next, SHODAN begins an attempt to upload itself into Earth's computer networks. Following Rebecca's advice, the hacker prevents the download's completion by destroying the four antennas that SHODAN is using to send data.|$|E

25|$|Hafslund Station was {{established}} in 1931, {{with the introduction of}} multiple units on the Eastern Østfold Line. Originally a flag stop, it was situated just east of the bridge. The interchange between the two lines was from 1933 remotely controlled from Sarpsborg Station, as the fist remotely controlled interchange in the country. The Østfold Line was electrified during the late 1930s and early 1940s. The section between Sarpsborg and Halden, and thus the Sarp Bridge, was <b>powered</b> <b>up</b> on 11 November 1940.|$|E
