50|$|In 1881 {{the first}} Foden {{traction}} engine {{was built in}} Sandbach, Cheshire. Then in 1898 Edwin Richard Foden influenced future truck design by designing the first steam wagon running on steel <b>tyre</b> <b>wheels</b> which had been successful until 1913 when vulcanised solid rubber tyre development had advanced to the stage of allowing their fitment on heavy vehicles. Edwin introduced the first pneumatic-tyred Foden steam wagon, but as steam transport appeared to be going out of favour, Edwin {{turned his attention to}} the development of a 6-8 ton chassis fitted with new Gardner LW (Light Weight) high speed oil-engine.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} of a quadratic programming formulation for the solution of layered elastic contact problems {{in the presence of}} friction is presented in this paper. Conveyor belts, <b>tyred</b> <b>wheels,</b> composite cylinders, and conrod bearings, are classical examples of systems which can be studied using the efficient numerical methodology proposed here. In this type of mechanical assembly, micro-slip between the mating surfaces often occurs and may eventually lead to system failure. Accurately capturing the evolution of slip and stick areas using a computationally inexpensive procedure (as an alternative to full finite element analysis) is therefore key to preventing these failures and to improving the design of various engineering components...|$|R

50|$|Deoni {{bullocks}} {{are good}} for heavy work and are particularly suitable for intensive cultivation. A bullock pair was able to pull the load of 10-11 quintals using wooden heavy cart with wooden wheels on kutcha (muddy) road. They are able to pull a maximum of 28-30 quintals of load using a light steel bullock cart with <b>tyre</b> <b>wheels</b> on tar roads for about 10-15 km. One pair of bullocks can pull the medium plough for about seven to {{eight hours a day}} and can plough about half an acre of land. The bullocks show their maximum potential at five to six years of age and maintain it up to 10-12 years of age. (Singh, 2002).|$|R
40|$|In this paper, <b>tyred</b> <b>wheel</b> dynamic {{response}} to road excitation during rolling has been simulated using finite element modelling in a graphical programming environment. The actual contact {{is an area}} not a single line and the contact edges are subject to continuous impacts during the rolling. The structural {{response to}} the impact generates structure borne noise as part of pollution to the environment. To reduce the wheel noise {{can be achieved by}} attenuating the intensity of structural vibration. The relationship between the noise generation energy of wheel and damping is investigated. It is proposed to reduce the noise by increasing the damping in the tyre structure. The effectiveness has been demonstrated by the simulation result...|$|R
50|$|The livery {{of these}} wagons was of {{unpainted}} metal hoppers and black underframes. The hopper support framework was originally brown, then red {{with the introduction}} of the new Railfreight image in the late 1970s. When Railfreight re-invented itself in 1987, a new livery with yellow framework and a large coal sector logo on the hopper side was introduced. Under EWS the framework is now painted maroon. Merry-go-round hoppers were worked hard however, and the typical livery included a coating of coal dust. Some of the terminals served used stationary shunters to move the wagons forward at low speed. These often featured <b>tyred</b> <b>wheels</b> that gripped the wagon sides, resulting in horizontal streaks on the hopper sides.|$|R

50|$|The first models {{featured}} dark grey one-piece plastic {{wheels and}} chromed plastic bases. These cheaper bases made the models lighter and perhaps less durable than Matchbox cars (Rixon 2005, pp. 32-33). Still, their construction did {{allow for a}} simple suspension system to be installed {{by means of the}} axle being positioned to be sandwiched between the main base and a section of the plastic base which was cut away on three of sides to form a plastic tongue, which acted as a crude springing mechanism. In 1969 Mettoy re-designed and improved the quality of the models. Die cast metal bases, better suspension and two-piece separate hub and <b>tyre</b> <b>wheels</b> were fitted to upgrade existing models along with a variety of new models that were added to the range.|$|R

When the gun is brought into action the pivot jack is folded down and adjusted to be on the ground. If the requires large traverse, small jacks on each trail leg are rotated downwards, and the trails jacked up until the main wheels are lifted clear of the ground and the bogey wheels mounted on each trail leg swung downwards and the trail jacks raised, the carriage is then traversed, and the trail jacks re-used to lift the bogey wheels and then place the piece back on its main wheels.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{describes}} a {{finite element model}} used to investigate the quasi-static behaviour of a stationary automobile tyre vertically loaded against a stiff horizontal surface. The model includes {{a representation of the}} <b>tyre,</b> a steel <b>wheel</b> and a surface. The tyre is represented in detail by a number of <b>tyre</b> components, the <b>wheel</b> and surface are coarsely modelled. LS-DYNA 3 D is used to simulate the inflation of the tyre, the fit between the <b>tyre</b> and the <b>wheel</b> and the vertical loading of the tyre against the surface. Simulation results, such as the load-deflection characteristics and the load-tyre/ground contact patch dimensions are compared with mixed success to those obtained experimentally. The stiffness of the tyre components and the inflation pressure are varied independently and the simulation is repeated. The resulting load-tyre/ground contact patch dimensions are discussed in context with the development of a rolling tyre model. KEY WORDS: LS-DYNA 3 D, automobile tyre, load-deflection characteristics, load-tyre/ground contact patch dimensions...|$|R
5000|$|The R8, {{like most}} mid- or rear-engine {{designed}} sports cars, utilises wider <b>wheels</b> and <b>tyres</b> on its rear axle. For the 18-inch alloy wheels (on standard summer tyres), {{there is just}} one range of sizes—the fronts are sized at 8.5J×18H2 ET42, whilst the rears are two inches wider at 10.5Jx18H2 ET50. With the 19-inch wheels (standard fit in most markets), the theme continues—the fronts are all 8.5J×19H2 ET42, and the rears are 11.0Jx19H2 ET50. 19-inch wheels for the winter tyre package have a ½" [...] narrower rear compared to the summer <b>tyre</b> <b>wheel</b> package. There is also a corresponding difference in tyre sizes—18's are 235/40 ZR18 95Y XL (eXtra Load) in front and 285/35 ZR18 101Y XL at the rear. For the 19-inch tyres, two different options are available—all fronts are 235/35 ZR19 91Y, and the rears are either 295/30 ZR19 100Y XL or 305/30 ZR19 102Y XL. Standard factory supplied tyre makes offered are either Continental SportContact3 or Pirelli P-Zero Rosso.|$|R
