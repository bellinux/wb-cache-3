25|$|In the 1990s, the {{technology}} industry {{began to emerge}} in Portland, specifically {{with the establishment of}} companies like Intel, which brought more than $10 billion in investments in 1995 alone. After the year 2000, Portland experienced significant growth, with a population rise of over 90,000 between the years 2000 and 2014. The city's increased presence within the cultural lexicon has established it as a popular city for young people, and it was second only to Louisville, Kentucky as one of the cities to attract and retain the highest number of college-educated people in the United States. Between 2001 and 2012, Portland's gross domestic product per person grew fifty <b>percent,</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> any other city in the country.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{production}} budget of $18million was 50 <b>percent</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> {{that of the}} original. After the various increases in budget, The Empire Strikes Back {{became one of the}} most expensive films of its day and after the bank threatened to pull his loan, Lucas was forced to approach 20th Century Fox. Lucas made a deal with the studio to secure the loan in exchange for paying the studio more money, but without the loss of his sequel and merchandising rights. After the film's box office success, unhappiness at the studio over the deal's generosity to Lucas caused studio president Alan Ladd, Jr. to quit. The departure of his longtime ally caused Lucas to take Raiders of the Lost Ark to Paramount Pictures.|$|E
25|$|The French raised 117 {{divisions}}, {{of which}} 104 (including 11 in reserve) {{were for the}} defence of the north. The British contributed 13 divisions in the BEF, three of which were untrained and poorly-armed labour divisions. Twenty-two Belgian, ten Dutch and two Polish divisions were {{also part of the}} Allied order of battle. British artillery strength amounted to 1,280 guns, Belgium fielded 1,338 guns, the Dutch 656 guns and France 10,700 guns, giving an Allied total of about 14,000 guns, 45 <b>percent</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the German total. The French army was also more motorised than its opponent, which still relied on horses. Although the Belgians, British and Dutch had few tanks, the French had 3,254 tanks, larger than the German tank fleet.|$|E

25|$|The West Indies {{victory in}} the 1976 series {{was the first of}} seven {{consecutive}} wins over England. The 1976 series also helped salvage the then financially struggling Test and County Cricket Board (TCCB). The series generated £950,000 for the TCCB, forty <b>percent</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> The Ashes of 1975 had produced in revenue. For the next two decades, the West Indies cricket would dominate international cricket, never losing a series for fifteen years. The 1976 series has been characterized as a turning point for the West Indies cricket team. The series revealed to the cricketing world a new generation of West Indian cricket superstars like Viv Richards, Clive Lloyd, and Michael Holding. The victory exposed the West Indies team as a group of world-class cricketers who had developed into a major threat in international cricket.|$|E

An area of 116 census tracts in the North County region of the conurbation has a population of 615,092 and a per capita income of $44,131 which is about 50 <b>percent</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> that of California and the entire United States. This area contains nearly all of the area located in the cities of Carlsbad, Encinitas, Solana Beach, and Del Mar.

25|$|An IMD survey {{published}} in 2012 ranked Israel in eleventh place out of 59 developed nations for participation {{of women in}} the workplace. In the same survey, Israel was ranked 24th for the proportion of women serving in executive positions. Israeli law prohibits discrimination based on gender in employment and wages and provides for class action suits; nonetheless, there are complaints of significant wage disparities between men and women. The OECD reported in 2016 that income disparity between men in women in Israel is particularly high compared with other countries in the OECD. On average, men in Israel make 22 <b>percent</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> women, which places Israel among the four OECD (behind Japan, Estonia, and South Korea) with the highest wage inequality between men and women. The OECD average stands at 15 percent.|$|E

50|$|Publication of {{data and}} {{advocacy}} relevant to rights increased in recent decades. For example, the United Nations Human Development Report 2004 estimated that, when both paid employment and unpaid household tasks are accounted for, on average women work <b>more</b> <b>than</b> men. In rural areas of selected developing countries women performed an average of 20 <b>percent</b> <b>more</b> work <b>than</b> men, or an additional 102 minutes per day. In the OECD countries surveyed, on average women performed 5 <b>percent</b> <b>more</b> work <b>than</b> men, or 20 minutes per day when both paid employment and unpaid household tasks are taken into account.|$|R

25|$|Production {{assembly}} of the ES 300 commenced on 9 September 1991, and the sedan went on sale later that year in the U.S. as a 1992 model. The sedan was not released in Europe, where similar Toyota models were offered. The second-generation ES was a major sales success, becoming Lexus' best-selling vehicle overall. In its first full year of sales, the ES logged 39,652 units, and throughout the following years of its production run, sales reached near or above that figure. Although the initial US base price was $26,550, this increased to over $30,000 in later years. By 1994, {{in part because of}} the rising yen and high demand, the manufacturer's suggested retail price had increased to $31,200, 19.3 <b>percent</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the original 1992 figure. In 1993, a passenger airbag was added as standard equipment.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 3,604 users floated on the Smith River in 1993, 246.5 <b>percent</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> floated the river when the {{management}} plan came into force in 1988. In July 1994, user fees were {{so high that}} they enabled the FWP to purchase the Eden Bridge take-out, and they continued {{to pay for the}} presence of a full-time river ranger (the only river in the state to have one). FWP now managed four developed access sites (Smith River Fishing Access Site, Camp Baker, Eden Bridge, and Truly Bridge) and four undeveloped access sites (Fort Logan Bridge, Johnston Bridge, upper Smith River Road Bridge, and lower Smith River Road Bridge). It maintained 27 boat camps (nine of them leased from private landowners), which contained 54 camp sites. Although the 1988 management plan called for protecting additional land in the Smith River corridor, FWP's budget and the small size of the CEA meant that the agency had been able to purchase no conservation easements or leases, acquire no new land, engage in no new land exchanges or transactions, and had no zoning authority to protect the viewshed.|$|E
25|$|On December 16, 1996, federal {{election}} overseers announced that Carey had defeated Hoffa, 52 percent to 48 <b>percent.</b> <b>More</b> <b>than</b> 475,000 ballots were {{cast in the}} election. The vote count proceeded very slowly, leading to protests from both candidates the vote-counting rules had been violated. Carey declared victory on December 15, 1996. Hoffa, however, refused to concede, claiming 31,000 challenged ballots remained to be counted. Federal officials overseeing the election confirmed the victory the next day, and certified the election on January 10, 1997. Later analyses showed that Carey drew most of his support from Teamsters locals in the East and Deep South and Canada, Hoffa led in the Midwest, and the two candidates were neck and neck in the West. Despite the victory, many observers noted that Hoffa ran a much stronger campaign than expected. Many union members were attracted by the Hoffa name, while others (particularly in the Midwest) felt Carey had negotiated weak contracts. But federal officials and labor movement insiders pointed out that Carey had undermined the power, income, prestige, and perks of hundreds of local union officials through his anti-corruption drive. Hoffa {{had the support of}} a large majority of these local leaders, and they ensured that the Hoffa message reached the rank and file and the Carey message did not.|$|E
