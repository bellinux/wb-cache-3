40|$|The Federal Communications Commission {{recently}} {{decided that}} the price a local exchange carrier charges other carriers for access to its network may recover only long-run incremental costs and a reasonable share of forward-looking common costs. The FCC thereby rejected the 2 ̆ 2 <b>parity</b> <b>pricing</b> 2 ̆ 2 rule recently advocated in this Journal by William J. Baumol and J. Gregory Sidak as the standard for pricing access to the network bottleneck facilities controlled by monopolists. This rule calls for access prices to recover not only the long-run incremental cost but also all other 2 ̆ 2 opportunity costs. 2 ̆ 2 These include any monopoly rents and any contributions to imprudent investment that monopolists are collecting in sales of retail services but will lose {{as a result of}} providing access. This Article presents evidence that <b>parity</b> <b>pricing</b> is not of general applicability to regulatory policies in the United States. When retail prices are already at efficient levels, the rule recovers the same costs as a traditional pricing model like the FCC plan. <b>Parity</b> <b>pricing</b> therefore is interesting as a replacement for the FCC plan only when retail prices recover substantial monopoly rents or cost inefficiencies. The issue is whether regulators in that situation are more likely to achieve efficient retail prices by setting prices directly after determining incremental costs for numerous services or by setting prices for a few bottleneck facilities to promote competitive entry. Results from the FCC 2 ̆ 7 s first formal study of long-run incremental costs show the difficulty of unraveling incremental costs, even when services are provided by the simplest configuration of facilities. The author thus agrees with William B. Tye and Carlos Lapuerta that regulators mandate access to bottleneck facilities as a way of fostering competition, moving retail prices closer to the efficient levels they cannot identify. These goals cannot be achieved by <b>parity</b> <b>pricing</b> because it requires access prices to include the monopoly profits and cost inefficiencies that regulators are trying to eliminate...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the free}} market, the prices that yielded were {{considered}} to be unfair to farmers. Under the traditional support system, the government would raise the price to a [...] "parity" [...] price, at which consumers would not be willing to buy as much. In turn, the government would purchase excess supply, leading to large amounts of storage. However, under the Brannan PLan, the government would allow the surplus to be sold for whatever price it would bring. Consequently, the price would drop to that determined by the market, resulting in an elimination of the surplus. To compensate for the low prices, the Treasury would write checks to farmers for the difference between the high <b>parity</b> <b>price</b> and the low new market price. All together, consumers would pay lower prices for farm products, resources would not be wasted producing food simply for storage, and farmers would benefit by receiving the <b>parity</b> <b>price</b> while producing the quantity demanded at the market price for the surplus.|$|E

A significant change in economic policies of Pakistan has profound implications for national economy, the study of comparative advantage is of major importance to know the extent and potential for comparative advantage and competition of agricultural commodities. This {{is also important to}} identify the priorities for resource allocation among competing crops. This study is aimed at analyzing the changing agricultural comparative advantage over time and its implications for trade development. The extent of policy distortion and agricultural protection is also determined by the study. Four major corps i. e wheat, rice cotton and sugarcane are analyzed by taking the data of two main provinces for three harvesting years i. e 2001 - 01 to 2002 - 03. The data were analyzed to smooth out variations over time. Initially crop budgets were considered to analyzed the crop performance, in financial terms. Later on the import and export parity estimates were obtained to evaluate comparative advantage, in economic prices. The policy analysis matrix (PAM) was developed for four major crops that nearly consume 90 percent of the domestic resources and have high economic importance. The static analysis showed that Pakistan has comparative advantage at export <b>parity</b> <b>prices</b> for cotton and rice. The wheat and sugarcane have comparative advantage but at import <b>parity</b> <b>prices.</b> They have no comparative advantage at export <b>parity</b> <b>prices.</b> The DRC is fairly high for wheat and sugarcane. The analysis was further subjected to Risk analysis. The price of commodities and prices of DAP and Potash were taken as risk variables to evaluate comparative advantage and competitiveness of crops in the changing scenario. The risk analysis showed that rice and cotton in Pakistan have comparative advantage at export <b>parity</b> <b>prices.</b> Both maintained comparative edge even under price risk situation in wake of trade liberalization and export trade regimes in the next five years. The wheat and sugarcane showed a significant comparative advantage as import substitution crops but showed marginal competitiveness in the risk situation in the next five years, at national level. The analysis showed that Pakistan has to maintain competitive edge in rice and cotton through quality produce and value addition. The productivity of wheat and sugarcane should be enhanced along with reduction in cost of production. The subsidy on urea (given on gas) and irrigation water should be reviewed. Sugarcane is highly water consumptives crop. Its area may be reduced and the production loss thus created can be covered through manifold increase in yield...|$|R
