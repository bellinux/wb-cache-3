5|$|Meanwhile, {{during this}} time of {{increased}} media publicity of the controversy, <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>officials</b> and institutions did little to rebut the concerns and speculative theories being offered. Media attention and polarization of the debate has also been fueled by personal injury lawyers who took out full-page ads in prominent newspapers and offered financial support for expert witnesses who dissented from the scientific consensus {{that there is no}} convincing evidence for a link between thiomersal and autism. Paul Offit, a leading vaccine researcher and advocate, has said that the media has a tendency to provide false balance by perpetually presenting both sides of an issue even when only one side is supported by the evidence and thereby giving a platform for the spread of misinformation.|$|E
5|$|The {{reason for}} the rise of polio in industrialised {{countries}} in the 20th century has never been fully explained. The disease {{is caused by a}} virus that is passed from person to person by the faecal-oral route, and naturally infects only humans. It is a paradox that it became a problem during times of improved sanitation and increasing affluence. Although the virus was discovered {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, its ubiquity was unrecognised until the 1950s. It is now known that fewer than two per cent of individuals who are infected develop the disease, and most infections are mild. During epidemics the virus was effectively everywhere, which explains why <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>officials</b> were unable to isolate a source.|$|E
5|$|The story also {{highlights}} {{examples of}} political cronyism (a plane to evacuate Dr. Mears from Minneapolis is instead diverted to evacuate a Congressman), platitudes and rigid thinking (<b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>officials</b> consider postponing {{the closing of}} shopping malls until after the Thanksgiving shopping season), federal responders trying to navigate 50 separate state-level public health policies, and the heroism of Federal bureaucrats. Soderbergh does not use type-cast pharmaceutical executives or politicians as villains, but instead portrays bloggers such as Krumwiede in a negative light. Social media {{plays a role in}} Krumwiede's accusations against Dr. Cheever and in Emhoff's daughter's attempts to carry on a relationship with her boyfriend through text messaging. Other responses in the movie, such as Emhoff's appropriating a shotgun from a friend's abandoned house to protect his home from looters, imposition of federal quarantines and curfews, the allocation of vaccines by lottery, inadequate federal preparation and responses, and use of bar-coded wristbands to identify the inoculated highlight the complex tensions between freedom and order in responding to a pandemic. Soderbergh uses Emhoff to illustrate the micro-effects of macro-level decisions.|$|E

25|$|On November 28, 2001, Petrelis and Pasquarelli {{appeared}} before the San Francisco County Superior Court for a hearing on civil harassment suits by two <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>officials,</b> and five San Francisco Chronicle editors and reporters who claimed they received threatening phone calls. In the courthouse hallway after the hearing, San Francisco Police Department officers arrested Petrelis and Pasquarelli. The activists were charged with criminal conspiracy, stalking, and making terrorist threats against newspaper reporters and <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>officials.</b> Petrelis' bail was set at $500,000; Pasquarelli's bail was set at $600,000. On November 30, 2001, a judge refused the arrestees' request for {{a reduction in the}} unusually high bail. Mark Vermeulen, the attorney representing Petrelis and Pasquarelli, said the activists were abiding by the restraining orders, the matter was being handled by the civil courts, {{and that there was no}} need for criminal prosecution.

25|$|This new strain {{appeared}} to be {{closely related to the}} strain involved in the 1918 flu pandemic. Moreover, the ensuing increased surveillance uncovered another strain in circulation in the U.S.: A/Victoria/75 (H3N2), which spread simultaneously, also caused illness, and persisted until March. Alarmed <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>officials</b> decided action must be taken to head off another major pandemic, and urged President Gerald Ford that every person in the U.S. be vaccinated for the disease.|$|E
25|$|While some <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>officials,</b> pediatricians, {{and social}} workers wanted to {{eliminate}} midwifery, others did not think this would solve the problem. In the 1910s and 1920s, S. Josephine Baker, director of the New York City Bureau of Child Hygiene, advocated to keep midwives because many immigrants and African-Americans whom midwives have traditionally served could not afford the care of physicians. As such, {{the solution of the}} “midwife problem” was to train, license, and regulate them.|$|E
25|$|A serious {{environmental}} issue occurred in Ivy City in 1999.

District of Columbia Department of <b>Public</b> <b>Health</b> <b>officials</b> said the company had removed the insulation without proper safety procedures from its buildings, and then dumped them {{in an area where}} residents could come into contact with the cancer-causing asbestos.|$|E

25|$|Interaction {{between humans}} and C. macellaria outside of {{accidental}} secondary myiasis has been largely unremarkable, with the notable exception of their early use in surgical maggot therapy. However, given the medical stigma surrounding the screwworm fly, and the slight potential for even C. macellaria to secondarily infest tissue beyond the desired extent of medical use, it has currently fallen out of favor with the medical community, which prefers the predictable Lucilia sericata. Nonetheless, C. macellaria has been and remains a concern for farmers, veterinarians, and <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>officials.</b>|$|E
25|$|Rats are elusive by nature, and <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>officials</b> {{have not}} {{developed}} any reliable way to estimate their numbers. An often-repeated statistic {{is that there}} are more rats than people in the five boroughs of New York City (8.4 million in 2014), with some estimates putting the number of rats far higher at as many as five rats per person (33.6 million). However, a 2014 study by Jonathan Auerbach, reported in the Royal Statistical Society's Significance magazine, estimated that there were closer to 2 million rats in the city.|$|E

25|$|Nearly a {{year and}} a half later, the activists pleaded no contest to {{misdemeanor}} charges of making threatening phone calls to <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>officials</b> and reporters at the San Francisco Chronicle. The court sentenced Petrelis and Pasquarelli to one year in jail, suspended to three years probation, and ordered the activists to attend anger management training, stay away from the officials and reporters for three years, and issue written apologies to their victims. Under the agreement, Petrelis was allowed to send the San Francisco Chronicle one letter or fax per day on matters of public interest.|$|E
25|$|Many {{antibiotics}} {{that were}} once effective including penicillin, tetracycline, and fluoroquinolones are no longer recommended because of high rates of resistance. Resistance to cefixime has reached a level such {{that it is no}} longer recommended as a first-line agent in the United States, and if it is used a person should be tested again after a week to determine whether the infection still persists. Cases of resistance to ceftriaxone have been reported but are still rare, though <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>officials</b> are concerned that an emerging pattern of resistance may predict a global epidemic. The UK's Health Protection Agency reported that 2011 saw a slight drop in gonorrhea antibiotic resistance, the first in 5 years.|$|E
25|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) has {{recommended}} {{sexually transmitted infection}} as the preferred term since 1999. Sexually transmitted infection is a broader term than sexually transmitted disease. An infection is a colonization by a parasitic species, which may not cause any adverse effects. In a disease, the infection leads to impaired or abnormal function. In either case, the condition may not exhibit signs or symptoms. Increased understanding of infections like HPV, which infects {{a significant portion of}} sexually active individuals but cause disease in only a few, has led to increased use of the term STI. <b>Public</b> <b>health</b> <b>officials</b> originally introduced the term sexually transmitted infection, which clinicians are increasingly using alongside the term sexually transmitted disease in order to distinguish it from the former.|$|E
