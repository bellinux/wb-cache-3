[...] From the early 1800s, [...] "programs" [...] were used to direct the behavior of machines such as Jacquard looms and player pianos. Thousands of different programming languages have been created, mainly in the computer field, and many more still are being created every year. Many programming languages require computation to be specified in an imperative form (i.e., as a sequence of operations to perform) while other languages use other forms of program specification such as the declarative form (i.e. the desired result is specified, not how to achieve it).|$|E
5000|$|Early 16th century female {{settlers}} {{along the}} St. Lawrence and in Acadia were almost all {{were familiar with}} the techniques of spinning yarn and weaving cloth for everyday clothes and bedding and the home production of textiles eventually became an important cottage industry. The spinning wheel and loom were features of many colonial homes and weaving techniques included the [...] "à la planche" [...] and [...] "boutonné" [...] methods. Loyalist women settling in Upper and Lower Canada grew flax and raised sheep for wool to make clothing, blankets and linen. The Jacquard loom, introduced in the 1830s, featured a complex system of punch cards to control the pattern and was the first <b>programmable</b> <b>machine</b> in Canada. With the arrival of industrial textile mills in Montreal and Toronto in the late 19th century, the economic advantage of home weaving faded.|$|E

40|$|This Thesis {{develops}} {{methods for}} managing {{software and hardware}} during {{the life cycle of}} a <b>programmable</b> <b>machine</b> control platform. Life cycle management is important because of the long life cycle of this platform. Software reproducibility, management of software products, version controlling, test automation, continuous integration, and configurability of software are considered. These issues are implemented by processes for software configuration management, application life cycle management, and product life cycle management. The processes are described within the contexts of a <b>programmable</b> <b>machine</b> control platform in this Thesis. The core of this work is embedded software framework, which creates the software architecture for the platform. A previously used embedded software framework was not suitable for controlling multiple software products and it only supported few hardware platforms. In addition, the lack of community and enterprise support and the framework’s poor usability were major disadvantages. Therefore, a new embedded software framework was deployed in this Thesis. Open-source and commercial options for an embedded software framework were compared and the Yocto Project was chosen. It was the best option meeting the requirements on <b>programmable</b> <b>machine</b> control platform. Based on it, new methods were studied and specified for managing software configurations and versions, reproducibility, version controlling, and application creation. A new layer for the Yocto Project was also created in this Thesis. The new layer simplifies software and hardware modifications significantly. The layer consists of 76 files, including over 3000 lines of code and configuration information. In addition, a new server for continuous integration and test automation was deployed. It took a total of 180 working hours to create the layer and deploy the additional tools. Measurements were gathered to estimate the workload for different tasks. Furthermore, a number of metrics were created to provide a simple way to estimate the effectiveness of the tools and the processes...|$|E
