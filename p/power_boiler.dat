In {{order to find}} the optimal shape of a thick-walled <b>power</b> <b>boiler</b> component, a parametric FE model and the evolutionary algorithm (EA) are applied. The <b>power</b> <b>boiler</b> start-up and shutdown curves {{are based on the}} TRD 301 guidelines. Maximum total stresses are assumed as optimization constraints. The obtained geometry is by about 18. 6 % lighter than the original one due to thinning of the walls. Maximum tensile and compressive stresses in the modified geometry are smaller than in the original one during the whole cycle. Additionally, lower total stress values are recorded during heating and cooling processes. Therefore, these transient processes can be accelerated and the shutdown and start-up losses can be reduced...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} waste {{gasification}} as a technology allowing co-firing of {{large quantities of}} biodegradable wastes in power boilers. In contrast to common landfilling and direct co-firing, gasification of wastes presents a number of advantages. Problematic species in original feedstocks can be partly safely incinerated in the furnace and partly retained in the gasification residues. Little effect on <b>power</b> <b>boiler</b> operation in terms of long term phenomena like fouling or corrosion {{is expected to be}} associated with co-firing of low calorific gas in standard coal powered boilers. Moreover, combustion characteristics in the furnace can even benefit from the co-firing of biodegradable wastes due to an enhanced reburning effect. The paper focuses on proper introduction of low-calorific gases derived from gasification of biomass and wastes into solid fuel fired boilers. Possible injection methods are described and the influence of co-firing low calorific value gas on <b>power</b> <b>boiler</b> operation is discussed. JRC. F. 2 -Cleaner energie...|$|E

30|$|This {{proposed}} {{method is}} a promising way, {{which can be}} implemented in pulp and paper industries by effective removal of the color and chemical oxygen demand (COD) and the resulting treated water may surely reuse to the other streams. Fourier Transformer Infra Red spectra confirmed {{the presence of the}} respective functional groups in the removed pollutants from the wastewater. The efficiency of Non-ferric Alum (NF Alum) and cationic polyacrylamide (C-PAM) with and without <b>power</b> <b>boiler</b> fly ash was also studied. The reduction efficiency of color and chemical oxygen demand (COD) is evaluated at the optimum dosage of NF Alum, fly ash, and C-PAM. At the optimized pH attained from these coagulants using to treat the wastewater, the flocs formation/settling and the pollutant removal efficiency are encouraging and the resulting color of the wastewater is to 40 PtCo units from 330 PtCo units and COD to 66  mg/L from 218  mg/L. While using NF Alum alone with C-PAM for the treatment of wastewater, the highest reduction efficiency of COD is 97  mg/L from 218  mg/L and the color is 60 from 330 PtCo units at pH 4.8 was noted. From these observations, NF Alum and <b>power</b> <b>boiler</b> fly ash with C-PAM can effectively remove the pollutants from the pulp and paper mill wastewater and the water can be reused for other streams.|$|E

The complete sugarcane biorefinery was simulated using Aspen Plus®. Although the pentoses stream available in the sugarcane biorefinery gives room for a relatively small biobutanol plant (7. 1 – 12 thousand tonnes per year), the introduction of butanol and acetone to the product portfolio of the biorefinery increased and diversified its revenues. Whereas the IRR of the investment on a biorefinery with biogas production is 11. 3 %, IRR varied between 13. 1 % and 15. 2 % in the butanol production option, depending on technology (regular or engineered microorganism with improved butanol yield and pentoses conversion) and target market (chemicals or automotive fuels).

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 7 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Turkey, 19 - 21 July, 2010. This paper presents investigations towards finding new ways for the minimization of NOx emissions in the <b>power</b> <b>boiler.</b> These analyses were done in two directions: two stages of combustion into the furnace and {{a new system of}} re­-circulating gases. The purpose of carrying out both analyses had the objective of diminishing the emission of nitrogen oxides during the combustion processes. Both analyses were developed in a steam generator that currently working in the power plant "Villa de Reyes", Mexico. This steam generator Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of 350 MW is equipped with four levels of tangential burners and it bums fuel oil (C 23 H 37. 29) during its operation. These analyses were carried out {{from the point of view}} of decreasing temperatures in the active burning zone (ABZ). The methodology is based on four main parameters related to combustion process in the furnace active burning zone (ABZ). Such parameters are the following: air excess coefficient in ABZ, average temperature in ABZ, reflected heat in ABZ and the residence time of combustion products in the ABZ. Two stage of combustion is achieved by having three levels of burners in the bottom operate rich and the top level supply air only. The first volume bums 100 % of fuel oil with 75 % of air. In the second volume bums 00 /o of fuel and is introduced 25 % of air. As a result, the decrease of NOx formation is up to 25 % in comparison to current emissions. On the other hand, the thermal calculation of furnace was done, and with the results it would be possible to change the place of recirculation gases to the hot air, changing the combustion processes and move the flame core position. The changes of the parameters to calculate NOx formation are the following: different thermal loads of the <b>power</b> <b>boiler</b> from 50 %, 75 %, 100 % and maximum load. Different fractions of recirculation gases are introduced from 23 % up to 61 %. As result, it is possible to decrease NOx emission up to 50 % in comparison to current emissions. ej 201...|$|E
