25|$|A {{clinical}} psychologist studies and applies psychology {{for the purpose}} of understanding, preventing, and relieving psychologically-based distress or dysfunction and to promote subjective well-being and personal development. In many countries it is a regulated profession that addresses moderate to more severe or chronic psychological problems, including diagnosable mental disorders. Clinical psychology includes a wide range of practices, such as research, <b>psychological</b> <b>assessment,</b> teaching, consultation, forensic testimony, and program development and administration. Central to clinical psychology is the practice of psychotherapy, which uses a wide range of techniques to change thoughts, feelings, or behaviors in service to enhancing subjective well-being, mental health, and life functioning. Unlike other mental health professionals, psychologists are trained to conduct <b>psychological</b> <b>assessment.</b> Clinical psychologists can work with individuals, couples, children, older adults, families, small groups, and communities.|$|E

25|$|Objective tests assume {{personality}} is consciously accessible {{and that it}} can be measured by self-report questionnaires. Research on <b>psychological</b> <b>assessment</b> has generally found objective tests to be more valid and reliable than projective tests. Critics have pointed to the Forer effect to suggest some of these appear to be more accurate and discriminating than they really are. Issues with these tests include false reporting because {{there is no way to}} tell if an individual is answering a question honestly or accurately.|$|E
25|$|<b>Psychological</b> <b>assessment</b> is a {{psychological}} evaluation process used by clinicians, {{in order to}} help them properly produce a hypothesis from the collected patient information. The Child PTSD Symptom Scale is a self-report assessment that clinicians use to diagnose PTSD symptoms and their severity in children ages 8–18. However, PTSD can be diagnosed much earlier than 8 years of age, and sometimes the victim fears who report their traumatic experiences. Therefore, other measures, such as teacher and caregiver assessments, must be conducted.|$|E
25|$|Clinical psychologists {{engage in}} a wide range of activities. Some focus solely on {{research}} into the assessment, treatment, or cause of mental illness and related conditions. Some teach, whether in a medical school or hospital setting, or in an academic department (e.g., psychology department) at an institution of higher education. The majority of clinical psychologists engage in some form of clinical practice, with professional services including <b>psychological</b> <b>assessment,</b> provision of psychotherapy, development and administration of clinical programs, and forensics (e.g., providing expert testimony in a legal proceeding.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} {{area of expertise}} for many clinical psychologists is <b>psychological</b> <b>assessment,</b> and {{there are indications that}} as many as 91% of psychologists engage in this core clinical practice. Such evaluation is usually done in service to gaining insight into and forming hypotheses about psychological or behavioral problems. As such, the results of such assessments are usually used to create generalized impressions (rather than diagnoses) in service to informing treatment planning. Methods include formal testing measures, interviews, reviewing past records, clinical observation, and physical examination.|$|E
25|$|Approximately one {{in three}} {{donations}} in the US, UK, and Israel is now from a live donor. Potential donors are carefully evaluated on medical and psychological grounds. This ensures that the donor is fit for surgery and has no disease which brings undue risk or likelihood of a poor outcome for either the donor or recipient. The <b>psychological</b> <b>assessment</b> is to ensure the donor gives informed consent and is not coerced. In countries where paying for organs is illegal, the authorities may also seek {{to ensure that a}} donation has not resulted from a financial transaction.|$|E
25|$|Even as {{clinical}} psychology was growing, working {{with issues of}} serious mental distress remained the domain of psychiatrists and neurologists. However, clinical psychologists continued to make inroads into this area due to their increasing skill at <b>psychological</b> <b>assessment.</b> Psychologists' reputation as assessment experts became solidified during World War I {{with the development of}} two intelligence tests, Army Alpha and Army Beta (testing verbal and nonverbal skills, respectively), which could be used with large groups of recruits. Due {{in large part to the}} success of these tests, assessment was to become the core discipline of {{clinical psychology}} for the next quarter century, when another war would propel the field into treatment.|$|E

25|$|In {{terms of}} methodology, the most {{elaborate}} <b>psychological</b> <b>assessment</b> of Hitler was undertaken in 2007 by a research team at the University of Colorado. This study differed from all earlier works by its open, exploratory approach. The team tested systematically which mental disorders Hitler's behavior may and {{may not have been}} indicating. It was the first Hitler pathography that was consistently empirical. The psychologists and historians reviewed passed down reports by people who knew Hitler personally, and evaluated these accounts in accordance with a self-developed diagnostic tool that allowed {{for a wide range of}} personality, clinical, and neuropsychological disturbances to be measured. According to this study, Hitler showed obvious traits of paranoia, but also of anti-social, sadistic, and narcissistic personality disorders, and distinct traits of posttraumatic stress disorder.|$|E
25|$|The {{field is}} often {{considered}} to have begun in 1896 {{with the opening of}} the first psychological clinic at the University of Pennsylvania by Lightner Witmer. In the first half of the 20th century, clinical psychology was focused on <b>psychological</b> <b>assessment,</b> with little attention given to treatment. This changed after the 1940s when World War II resulted in the need for a large increase in the number of trained clinicians. Since that time, three main educational models have developed in the USA—the Ph.D. Clinical Science model (heavily focused on research), the Ph.D. science-practitioner model (integrating research and practice), and the Psy.D. practitioner-scholar model (focusing on clinical practice). In the UK the Clinical Psychology Doctorate falls between the latter two of these models, whilst in much of mainland Europe the training is at masters level and predominantly psychotherapeutic. Clinical psychologists are expert in providing psychotherapy, and generally train within four primary theoretical orientations—psychodynamic, humanistic, behavior therapy/ cognitive behavioral, and systems or family therapy.|$|E

25|$|The {{provision}} of psychological health services is generally called clinical psychology in the U.S. The definitions of this term are various and may include school psychology and counseling psychology. Practitioners typically includes {{people who have}} graduated from doctoral programs in clinical psychology but may also include others. In Canada, the above groups usually fall within the larger category of professional psychology. In Canada and the US, practitioners get bachelor's degrees and doctorates, then spend one year in an internship and one year in postdoctoral education. In Mexico and most other Latin American and European countries, psychologists do not get bachelor's and doctorate degrees; instead, they take a three-year professional course following high school. Clinical psychology is at present the largest specialization within psychology. It includes the study and application of psychology {{for the purpose of}} understanding, preventing, and relieving psychologically based distress, dysfunction or mental illness and to promote subjective well-being and personal development. Central to its practice are <b>psychological</b> <b>assessment</b> and psychotherapy although clinical psychologists may also engage in research, teaching, consultation, forensic testimony, and program development and administration.|$|E
