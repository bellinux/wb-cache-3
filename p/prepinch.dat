40|$|Partially {{collective}} Thomson scattering measurements {{have been}} performed on a triggered vacuum arc in tin vapor, which is a candidate source of extreme ultraviolet light for application in semiconductor lithography. In this paper, results on the electron densities and temperatures are presented for the <b>prepinch</b> phase of the discharge. Electron densities and temperatures increase from 1 * 10 /sup 23 / m/sup - 3 / to 1 * 10 /sup 24 / m/sup - 3 / and from 5 eV to over 30 eV, respectively, in about 100 ns. The results are confirmed by Stark broadening dat...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} series of experiments, an existing Thomson scattering (TS) setup {{was applied for}} measuring electron temperatures and densities in a vacuum arc discharge in tin vapor, which is an experimental version of a candidate source for high power EUV generation. These experiments were succesful only for the so-called <b>prepinch</b> phase of the discharge, due to {{the high level of}} background radiation emitted {{in other parts of the}} plasma evolution. We have designed and built a new setup for sub-ns TS, based on a laser with shorter pulse duration, a faster camera, and an optical delay line in the laser path. Results of experiments on previously inaccessible phases of the discharge are presented. From these, a more complete picture of the evolution of the vacuum arc discharge can be derived...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} series of Thomson scattering (TS) experiments on an extreme ultraviolet producing vacuum arc discharge in tin vapor, background radiation emitted by the plasma {{was found to}} make measurements impossible for {{all parts of the}} discharge except the <b>prepinch</b> phase. To reduce the level of recorded background radiation, we have built a setup for time and space resolved subnanosecond TS. Results obtained with this new setup are presented for experiments on previously inaccessible parts of the dischargeâ€”the ignition phase, pinch phase, and decay phase. For the first two, measurements have been performed at different heights in the plasma. Electron densities for the pinch phase have been derived. For the decay phase, the electron densities confirm previous Stark broadening data. From the overall results, a more complete picture of the plasma evolution can be formed...|$|E
