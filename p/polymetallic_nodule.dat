50|$|Research {{shows that}} <b>polymetallic</b> <b>nodule</b> fields are {{hotspots}} of abundance and diversity for a highly vulnerable abyssal fauna. Nodule mining could affect {{tens of thousands}} of square kilometers of these deep sea ecosystems. Nodule regrowth takes decades to millions of years and that would make such mining an unsustainable and nonrenewable practice. Any prediction about the effects of mining is extremely uncertain. Thus, nodule mining could cause habitat alteration, direct mortality of benthic creatures, or suspension of sediment, which can smother filter feeders.Future environmental impact studies should address the impact on disruption and release of methane clathrate deposits in the deep oceans.|$|E

50|$|Odunton has {{had more}} than 20 years of {{experience}} in the International Civil Service, with progressively increased responsibilities in marine resource policy formulation, particularly marine mineral resources. Since the establishment of the Authority in 1996 he has concurrently held several positions there at the policy-making level, as Deputy to the Secretary-General, head of the ISA Office of Resources and Environmental Monitoring, Interim Director-General of the Enterprise (the Authority’s seabed mining arm, not yet operational) and Secretary of the Authority’s Assembly.

50|$|An {{example of}} the dual role is a project on <b>polymetallic</b> <b>nodules</b> that has been {{sponsored}} by the Government of India at the institute for well over 25 years. By the late 1970s the government had decided that the country needed to enhance its resources of minerals of strategic interest. NIO was given the responsibility of exploring the oceans for this purpose. On 26 January 1981, NIO hauled up <b>polymetallic</b> <b>nodules</b> from a depth of 4,800 m in the western Indian Ocean using its first research vessel, RV Gaveshani, which was acquired in 1976.|$|R

40|$|A {{new process}} for {{leaching}} metal values from ocean <b>polymetallic</b> <b>nodules</b> is introduced in this paper. The novel process {{consists of a}} few parts as follows: The liquid-phase oxidation of the ocean <b>polymetallic</b> <b>nodules</b> {{in the presence of}} oxygen by utilizing molten potassium hydroxide as medium to produce potassium manganate; the production of potassium permanganate from disproportionation of potassium manganate; the production of pure manganese dioxide and oxygen from thermal decomposition of potassium manganate; the clarification and recycling of potassium hydroxide; and the recovery and refining of the other enriched metal values by reduction ammonia leaching. The new process has the characters of less pollution and low energy consumption. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
50|$|Research {{shows that}} <b>polymetallic</b> <b>nodule</b> fields are {{hotspots}} of abundance and diversity for a highly vulnerable abyssal fauna. Because {{deep sea mining}} {{is a relatively new}} field, the complete consequences of full scale mining operations on this ecosystem are unknown. However, some researchers have said they believe that removal of parts of the sea floor will result in disturbances to the benthic layer, increased toxicity of the water column and sediment plumes from tailings. Removing parts of the sea floor could disturb the habitat of benthic organisms, with unknown long-term effects. Aside from the direct impact of mining the area, some researchers and environmental activists have raised concerns about leakage, spills and corrosion that could alter the mining area’s chemical makeup.|$|E

Studies over several years covering the key mineral area of the Central Pacific resulted in a technical study on biodiversity, species ranges and gene flow in the abyssal Pacific nodule province, with emphasis on predicting and managing the impacts of deep seabed mining [...] A workshop at Manoa, Hawaii, in October 2007 [...] produced a rationale and recommendations for the establishment of [...] "preservation reference areas" [...] in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, where nodule mining would be prohibited in order to leave the natural environment intact.

50|$|<b>Polymetallic</b> <b>nodules</b> have {{economically}} valuable metals such as Copper, Cobalt, Nickel and Manganese in {{them and}} are viewed as potential resources {{to take care of}} the depleting land resources and increasing demand of these metals. There are 380 million tons of nodules in the retained Indian Pioneer area. However development of deep subsea technology for mining these resources is a major challenge considering the ultra high pressure environment, very soft soils and other factors. NIOT has been working on a mining concept where a crawler based mining machine collects, crushes and pumps nodules to the mother ship using a positive displacement pump through a flexible riser system. It is expected that multiple mining machines will cover the mining field during large scale commercial mining operations. With this perspective, the integrated mining system is under development for demonstration of deep-sea mining of <b>polymetallic</b> <b>nodules.</b>|$|R
