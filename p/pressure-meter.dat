40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{investigation}} was to describe and validate an electronic mechanical test for quantification of the intensity of inflammatory nociception in mice. The electronic <b>pressure-meter</b> test consists of inducing the animal hindpaw flexion reflex by poking the plantar region with a polypropylene pipette tip adapted to a hand-held force transducer. This method was compared to the classical von Frey filaments test in which pressure intensity is automatically recorded after the nociceptive hindpaw flexion reflex. The electronic <b>pressure-meter</b> and the von Frey filaments were used to detect time versus treatment interactions of carrageenin-induced hypernociception. In two separate experiments, the electronic <b>pressure-meter</b> was more sensitive than the von Frey filaments {{for the detection of}} the increase in nociception (hypernociception) induced by small doses of carrageenin (30 µg). The electronic <b>pressure-meter</b> detected the antinociceptive effect of non-steroidal drugs in a dose-dependent manner. Indomethacin administered intraperitoneally (1. 8 - 15 mg/kg) or intraplantarly (30 - 300 µg/paw) prevented the hypersensitive effect of carrageenin (100 µg/paw). The electronic <b>pressure-meter</b> also detected the hypernociceptive effect of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2; 10 - 100 ng) in a dose-dependent manner. The hypernociceptive effect of PGE 2 (100 ng) was blocked by dipyrone (160 and 320 µg/paw) but not by intraplantar administration of indomethacin (300 µg/paw). The present results validate the use of the electronic <b>pressure-meter</b> as more sensitive than the von Frey filaments in mice. Furthermore, it is an objective and quantitative nociceptive test for the evaluation of the peripheral antinociceptive effect of anti-inflammatory analgesic drugs, which inhibit prostaglandin synthesis (indomethacin) or directly block the ongoing hypernociception (dipyrone) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the present investigation was to compare the sensitivity of an electronic nociceptive mechanical paw test with classical mechanical tests to quantify the intensity variation of inflammatory nociception. The electronic <b>pressure-meter</b> test consists of inducing the hindpaw flexion reflex by poking the plantar region with a polypropylene pipette tip adapted to a hand-held force transducer. This method was compared with the classical von Frey filaments test and with the rat paw constant pressure test, a modification of the Randall and Selitto test developed by our group. When comparing the three methods, the electronic <b>pressure-meter</b> and the rat paw constant pressure test, but not the von Frey filaments test, detected time vs treatment interactions in prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) -induced hypernociception. Both methods also detected the PGE 2 -induced hypernociception in dose- (50 - 400 ng/paw) and time- (1 - 4 h) dependent manners, and time vs treatment interactions induced by carrageenin (25 - 400 µg/paw). Furthermore, the electronic <b>pressure-meter</b> test was more sensitive at early times, whereas the constant pressure test was more sensitive at later times. Moreover, the electronic <b>pressure-meter</b> test detected the dose-dependent antinociceptive effect of local indomethacin (30 - 300 µg/paw) and dipyrone (80 - 320 µg/paw) on carrageenin- (200 µg/paw) and PGE 2 - (100 ng/paw) induced hypernociception, respectively, and also detected the ineffectiveness of indomethacin (300 µg) {{on the effect of}} PGE 2. Our results show that the electronic <b>pressure-meter</b> provides a sensitive, objective and quantitative mechanical nociceptive test that could be useful to characterize new nociceptive inflammatory mediators and also to evaluate new peripheral analgesic substances...|$|E
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} study {{was carried out}} to investigate static and dynamic soil properties for a high rise building in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. A total of 21 boreholes were drilled to a maximum depth of 100  m including the performance of Standard Penetration Tests and core measurements for rock formations. <b>Pressure-meter</b> tests were performed to determine Young, ES and shear, G moduli while shear wave velocity were measured through cross-hole method. The dynamic shear modulus Gmax and Poisson’s Ratio (υ) could be estimated directly through relations with shear wave velocity. Three boreholes at three locations were prepared during drilling for carrying out <b>pressure-meter</b> tests every 5. 0  m from ground surface down to 60. 0  m. Other two locations at the site were chosen to perform cross-hole tests. These tests were performed from ground surface down to 55. 0  m at intervals of 1. 50  m. A comprehensive comparison was established between the results of Young and shear moduli determined from <b>pressure-meter,</b> cross-hole and S. P. T. It was observed that the values of ES and G determined via <b>pressure-meter</b> are much less than those of Ei and Gmax determined via cross-hole tests. It was also observed {{that the results of}} shear wave velocity, estimated via S. P. T correlations, have a wide range but are in fair agreement with the results of cross-hole tests...|$|E
30|$|Mechanical allodynia was {{measured}} by recording the maximum pressure required to trigger hind paw withdrawal on day 0 (before paclitaxel administration, as baseline) and on days 7, 14 and 21 after first paclitaxel administration. The rats were allowed to habituate the testing chambers (22.0  ×  15.0  ×  12.5  cm) for 20  min. Mechanical allodynia was assessed using electronic von Frey anesthesiometer (0 – 90  g, electronic von Frey anesthesiometer, IITC Inc., Life Science Instruments, Woodland Hills, CA, USA) using a rigid tip, following a protocol adapted from that described by Vivancos et al. (2004). The <b>pressure-meter</b> consisted of a hand-held force transducer fitted with a 0.8  mm diameter polypropylene tip. The investigator applied the rigid tip perpendicularly to the mid-plantar surface of the hind paw with a gradual increase in pressure. A tilted mirror below the grid provided {{a clear view of}} the animal’s hind paw. The tests consisted of poking the hind paw to provoke a flexion reflex, followed by a clear flinch response after paw withdrawal. With the electronic <b>pressure-meter,</b> the maximum pressure of the stimulus was automatically recorded when the paw was withdrawn, as the pain threshold. The stimulation of the paw was repeated until the animal responded similarly (within 10  g) three times.|$|E
40|$|Interleukin (IL) - 18 has an {{important}} role in the pathogenesis of arthritis, which is accompanied by movement limitation sec-ondary to inflammatory articular nociception. Therefore, we investigated the possible mechanical hypernociceptive effect of IL- 18 in rats using the paw constant pressure and the electronic <b>pressure-meter</b> tests. In both tests, intraplantar administration of IL- 18 (20 – 60 ng paw 1) caused a dose- and time-dependent mechanical hypernociception, which peaked 3 h and reached control levels 24 h after injection. Pretreatments with indometh-acin (2. 5 mg kg 1), atenolol (1 mg kg 1), or 3 -[1 -(p-chloroben-zyl) - 5 -(isopropyl) - 3 -t-butylthioindol- 2 -yl]- 2; 2 -dimethylpro-panoic acid; Na (MK 886) (5 -lipoxygenase-activating protein inhibitor; 1 mg kg 1) did not inhibit IL- 18 -evoked hypernoci-ception (40 ng paw 1), whereas dexamethasone (2 mg kg 1...|$|E
40|$|Interleukin- 12 (IL- 12) is an {{inflammatory}} Th 1 -driving cytokine {{that has been}} clinically used as immune therapy and vaccine adjuvant. Recently, {{it was reported that}} patients receiving IL- 12 presented hyperalgesia. In the present study, we investigated the mechanical hyperalgesic effect of IL- 12 in rats using two tests: 1) paw constant pressure and 2) electronic <b>pressure-meter.</b> In both tests, intraplantar administration of IL- 12 (3 – 30 ng paw 1) caused a dose- and time-dependent mechanical hyperalgesia, which peaked between 3 to 5 h, remaining sig-nificantly different from control levels until 7 h and resolved 24 h postinjection. However, the same doses of IL- 12 did not induce thermal hyperalgesia, determined using the Hargreaves test.

40|$|Endothelin may {{contribute}} to the development of inflammatory events such as leukocyte recruitment and nociception. Herein, we investigated whether endothelin-mediated mechanical hypernociception (decreased nociceptive threshold, evaluated by electronic <b>pressure-meter)</b> and neutrophil migration (myeloperoxidase activity) are inter-dependent in antigen challenge-induced Th 1 -driven hind-paw inflammation. In antigen challenge-induced inflammation, endothelin (ET) ET(A) and ET(B) receptor antagonism inhibited both hypernociception and neutrophil migration. Interestingly, ET- 1 peptide-induced hypernociception was not altered by inhibiting neutrophil migration or endothelin ET(B) receptor antagonism, but rather by endothelin ET(A) receptor antagonism. Furthermore, endothelin ET(A), but not ET(B), receptor antagonism inhibited antigen-induced PGE(2) production, whereas either selective or combined blockade of endothelin ET(A) and/or ET(B) receptors reduced hypernociception and neutrophil recruitment caused by antigen challenge. Concluding, this study advances knowledge into the role for endothelin in inflammatory mechanisms and further supports the potential of endothelin receptor antagonists in controlling inflammation.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{estimation}} of magnitude of a soft soil settlement is very complex. Many settlement prediction methods {{have focused on}} correlations with “in situ ” tests, such as the Cone Penetration Test (CPT), Standard Penetration Test (SPT), Dilatometer Modulus Test (DMT), plate load test, <b>pressure-meter</b> test etc. However, most of the available methods are restricted by simplifying the problem by incorporating several assumptions for the factors that affect the settlement of any structures and sometimes these methods are quite costly. In the present study, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) {{has been used for}} predicting the compression index (Cc) rather than settlement of some tropical soft soil. ANNs are potentially useful in situations where the underlying physical process relationships are not fully understood and are well-suited in modeling dynamic systems on a real-time basis. The compressibility characteristics of soft soil can be predicted by using ANNs, if the physical properties of the soil e. g., liquid limit, specific gravity, moisture content etc. are known. Here the MATLAB-NEURAL NET software (with 3 -layer feed forward back propagation) has been adopted with different parameters. The parameters investigated are various learning rates; the number of neurons in the hidden layer; and learnin...|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} pain {{behavior and}} structural damage in mice subjected to either meniscal transection or removal. MethodsMice (10 /group) {{were subjected to}} transection of the medial collateral and anterior cruciate ligaments (ACLT/MCLT) followed by either transection (meniscotomy) or removal (meniscectomy) of the medial meniscus. A control group was subjected only to transection of the ligaments. Pain was assessed using the electronic <b>pressure-meter</b> paw test. Cell influx, measured in joint exudates, and joint histopathology were assessed after 49 days. Four other groups subjected to meniscotomy received indomethacin, the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) inhibitor 1400 W, morphine or the vehicles. ResultsBoth meniscotomy and meniscectomy groups displayed persistent and significant increase in pain behavior as compared to controls, being significantly more severe in the former. Cell influx was more intense in the meniscotomy {{as compared to the}} meniscectomy group. Structural damage at the tibia, but not at the femur, was also more severe in the meniscotomy group. Indomethacin and 1400 W partially but significantly reduced pain whereas morphine abrogated pain behavior in meniscotomized mice. ConclusionMeniscal transection rather than resection promotes more severe pain and structural damage in mice. Administration of opioids, cyclooxygenase and nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitors provide analgesia in this model. Careful description of the structures damaged is crucial when reporting experimental osteoarthritis (OA) ...|$|E
40|$|The Thessaloniki Metropolitan Railway is {{currently}} at its primary construction stage. The railway {{is composed of}} two separate similar to 6 -m-diameter parallel tunnels, {{each of which is}} similar to 8 km long and has 13 stations. The span between the tunnel axes is approximately 12 m, and the depth of the red line (track level) varies from 15 m to 30 m. The geology of the urban area of Thessaloniki is characterized by the presence of Neogene and Quaternary deposits. The base formation for the study area is a very stiff to hard red clay, dating to Upper Miocene-Pliocene time. On top of this formation, Quaternary sediments have been deposited, most of which consist of sand and/or gravel in a clay-silt-dominated matrix, covered in places by anthropogenic fill. Ground investigation campaigns have incorporated a significant number of sampling boreholes and in situ and laboratory testing. In this study, data from borehole loggings, particle-size analyses, natural moisture content, Atterberg limits, permeability tests, <b>pressure-meter</b> tests, cone penetration tests (CPT), and standard penetration tests (SPT) were analyzed in order to obtain a better geological understanding, a geotechnical zonation, and a classification of the ground with respect to mechanized tunneling. The characteristics and parameters of the soils and the hydrogeological regime indicate that an EPBM (Earth Pressure Balance Machine) rather than a slurry TBM (Tunnel Boring Machine) should be used for the tunnel construction...|$|E
