40|$|In {{recent years}} the use of {{adhesive}} bonds <b>for</b> <b>structural</b> <b>joints</b> has increased greatly. Currently, many different material types are combined in a sole product. Especially in applications where lightweight materials are used, adhesive bonded joints offer distinct advantages over traditional joining techniques like welding, bolting and riveting. Important features are the possibility to join different types of materials {{and the ability to}} smoothen structural stress concentrations. A lot of research work has already been performed in the field of adhesives. However, it mainly focuses on the more fundamental physical-chemical properties of the different adhesive types, substrate adhesion and theoretical models that describe the viscoelastic behaviour of adhesives. There is a high number of environmental parameters that influence the elastic behaviour of an adhesive joint. Therefore, also the vibration behaviour of adhesively bonded structures is a process that is subjected to many uncertainties. This paper focusses on the joining of glass fibre reinforced polypropylene honeycomb sandwich panels by means of an adhesive bond. The simple case of joining two rectangular panels is considered. A first part discusses the adhesive type and bonding application. It thereby focusses on the estimation of elastic properties of the bonded zone. The uncertainty involved is quantified where possible. The second part estimates the impact of the uncertainty on bonding parameters on the resonant behaviour of the two joined honeycomb panels.

Methods: Subjects comprised 33 patients with early RA and 33 patients with established RA. All patients received 3 mg/kg of infliximab and methotrexate for 54 weeks. Levels of the following serum cartilage markers were measured at baseline and at weeks 14, 22, and 54 : hyaluronan (HA); cartilage oligometric matrix protein (COMP); type II collagen (CII) -related neoepitope (C 2 C); type II procollagen carboxy-propeptide (CPII); and keratin sulfate (KS).

40|$|The {{successful}} {{application of}} the component-based approach – widely used to model <b>structural</b> <b>joints</b> – requires knowledge of the mechanical properties of the constitutive joint components, including an appropriate assembly procedure to derive the joint properties. This paper presents a component-method model <b>for</b> a <b>structural</b> <b>joint</b> component that {{is located in the}} tension zone of blind-bolted connections to concrete-filled tubular steel profiles. The model relates to the response of blind-bolts with headed anchors under monotonic loading, and the blind-bolt is termed the "Extended Hollo-bolt". Experimental data is used to develop the model, with the data being collected in a manner such that constitutive models were characterised for the principal elements which contribute to the global deformability of the connector. The model, based on a system of spring elements, incorporates pre-load and deformation from various parts of the blind-bolt: (i) the internal bolt elongation, (ii) the connector’s expanding sleeves element, and (iii) the connector’s mechanical anchorage element. The characteristics of these elements are determined on the basis of piecewise functions, accounting for basic geometrical and mechanical properties such as the strength of the concrete applied to the tube, the connection clamping length, and the size and class of the blind- bolt’s internal bolt. An assembly process is then detailed to establish the model for the elastic and inelastic behaviour of the component. Comparisons of model predictions with experimental data show that the proposed model can predict with sufficient accuracy the response of the component.

40|$|Fretting fatigue {{occurs when}} there is a small {{amplitude}} oscillatory movement between two contacting surfaces while the bodies are undergoing fatigue loading. Fretting fatigue conditions can substantially reduce the fatigue life of a component. Many engineering components such as Ti- 6 Al- 4 V gas turbine engine disks in military aircraft commonly experience fretting fatigue conditions that can potentially lead to catastrophic failure of critical components. 	The aim {{of this study is to}} characterize the behavior of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V under fretting fatigue conditions. Experiments are performed to analyze the influence of stress amplitude, stress ratio, and contact geometry. The effect of surface treatments such as low plasticity burnishing on the fretting fatigue life is also explored. The experimental results are being used to validate a proposed crack nucleation life prediction model. The proposed model utilizes a crack nucleation parameter H that is based on the strength of the singular stress field at the contact boundary. An advantage of this singular parameter is that neither a coefficient of friction nor the location of the stick/slip boundary needs to be determined. These two parameters are often difficult to define with certainty a priori.

40|$|International audienceIntroduction Osteoclasts play a {{key role}} in the {{pathogenesis}} of bone erosion and systemic bone mass loss during rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In this study, we aimed to determine the effect of methotrexate (MTX) and zoledronic acid (ZA), used alone or in combination, on osteoclast-mediated bone erosions and systemic bone mass loss in a rat model of collagen induced arthritis (CIA). We hypothesized that MTX and ZA could have an additive effect to prevent both bone erosion and systemic bone loss. Methods Arthritis was induced in 64 female Sprague-Dawley rats. After the clinical onset of CIA, rats were assigned to treatment with MTX (1 mg/kg/week), ZA (100 μg/kg twice weekly), both treatments at the same regimens, or vehicle. Arthritis score and paw thickness were recorded twice weekly. The rats were sacrificed on D 28 and hind paws were removed for radiographic, histological and immunohistochemical analysis. The effects of treatments on osteoclastogenesis were determined by Tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining. Micro-CT of the tibia was carried out for histomorphometric analysis. Bone mass density was evaluated by densitometry. Results MTX significantly decreased the severity of CIA, whereas ZA slightly exacerbated it. When these two drugs were used in combination, MTX prevented the pro-inflammatory effect of ZA. The combination of ZA with MTX was more effective than MTX alone <b>for</b> reducing <b>structural</b> <b>joint</b> damage with a dramatic decrease of osteoclasts' number in the eroded joints. However, MTX alone also significantly reduced the number of osteoclasts and the number of CD 68 + mononuclear cells. ZA alone, or ZA with MTX, significantly increased the systemic bone mass density measured by densitometry and bone volume on histomorphometric analysis. Conclusions A combination of MTX and ZA prevented both bone erosion and systemic bone loss in a rat model of arthritis. Both treatments independently decreased the number of osteoclasts in the eroded joint. However, while MTX probably acts mainly through a decrease of inflammation, ZA has a direct effect on osteoclasts, allowing a dramatic down-regulation of these cells in inflamed joints. These two different mechanisms of action provide support for the use of a combination of these two drugs to improve the prevention of <b>structural</b> <b>joint</b> damage in RA...|$|R

Anti-CCP 2 antibodies were detected in 55. 5 % of patients at baseline and 63. 6 % at any time during the first three years. Presence of anti-CCP 2 at any time during the first three years was associated with radiographic damage at baseline (odds ratio (OR), 3. 66; 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 0. 99 – 13. 54) and with five year progression of the total Sharp score (OR, 3. 17; 95 % CI, 1. 3 – 7. 7), erosion score (OR, 5. 3; 95 % CI, 1. 4 – 19. 2) and joint space narrowing score (OR, 2. 8; 95 % CI, 1. 15 – 6. 8).
