30|$|Another {{important}} issue, in a non-uniform context, is the <b>monitoring</b> <b>point</b> location: it {{is crucial}} to have available information in spots with high peak TF values; in HE 1, several <b>monitoring</b> <b>points</b> have TFs with a very low peak value which means that monitoring locations provide very poor information about the pollutant event development and numerically they generated a matrix H that is ill-conditioned.

Two experiment schemes {{were designed for}} analyzing the spatial variability and lateral orientation of <b>monitoring</b> <b>points</b> for soil moisture. In scheme 1, 44 <b>monitoring</b> <b>points</b> were positioned with sampling depth of 0 ~ 60 cm. In scheme 2, 20 <b>monitoring</b> <b>points</b> were placed with sampling depth of 0 ~ 80 cm. Samples were taken in the whole cotton growing period before and after irrigation in both schemes. Statistical analyses including Q-Q test, descriptive statistics, t-test and geo-statistical analysis were performed to the soil moisture data. The {{results indicate that the}} increase of soil moisture can enhance their spatial variability. In drip-irrigated cotton cultivation, spatial variability of soil moisture resulted from the combination of several random variables and the structural factors such as climate, topography, soil form. Semi-variogram models belong to spherical model and the range of spherical model for soil moisture is about 9. 40 m~ 35. 35 m. The accuracy of the fitted model decreases as the soil moisture content increases.

40|$|The {{security}} of {{civil engineering works}} demands a periodical monitoring of the structures. In many civil structures like bridges, vertical oil storage tanks and dams; the deformations are the most relevant parameters to be monitored. So monitoring the structural deformation and dynamic response to the large variety of external loadings has a great importance for maintaining structures safety and economical design of man-made structures. An effective approach is carried out to model the structure of oil storage tank by using well-chosen discrete <b>monitoring</b> <b>points</b> located on the outer surface at different levels which, when situated correctly, accurately depict the characteristics of this tank. Any movements of these <b>monitoring</b> <b>point</b> locations (and thus deformations of the structure) can be detected by maintaining the same point locations over time and by performing measurements to them at specified time intervals enabling direct point displacement comparisons. The number and distribution of <b>monitoring</b> <b>points</b> depends mainly on the type and shape of structure, but the positional accuracy of determining the coordinates depends on the {{method of data collection}} and accuracy of the used instruments. In this paper, modifications of three geodetic methods for determining the coordinates of <b>monitoring</b> <b>points</b> on the oil tank surface are presented...|$|R
30|$|The {{deformation}} {{velocity of}} <b>monitoring</b> <b>points</b> (a 4 and a 5) in R–Cw–M model were {{basically the same}} at the initial elastic loading stage while deviated in the late stage. The first fluctuation of <b>monitoring</b> <b>point</b> a 4 appears before the stress fluctuation point at pre-peak stage and the negative fluctuation is not obvious, while a 5 presents obvious negative jump. At the strain softening stage, a large positive jump appears in point a 4, while the <b>monitoring</b> <b>points</b> a 5, a 6 and a 7 produce a large negative fluctuation. This indicates that the zones near the contact surface are suffered severe damage. From the above results, the failure evolution processes in the two models are completely different although the stress evolutions show the same changing law. The jumps of deformation velocities {{can be regarded as}} the precursor information of failure and a sign of the main rupture perforation.|$|R

40|$|Many {{countries}} expend considerable resources {{collecting and}} reporting data from national groundwater quality monitoring networks to assess diffuse nitrate contamination, but {{the reliability of}} these data depends {{on the effectiveness of}} the network. Without a representative monitoring network of reliable <b>monitoring</b> <b>points,</b> there is a risk that groundwater management policies could be developed and implemented based on poor evidence. To help increase confidence in nitrate data, a robust, practical and repeatable method was developed to assess the effectiveness of groundwater nitrate monitoring networks, and applied to a network in Scotland. The method combines a rapid site assessment of <b>monitoring</b> <b>points</b> and local pollution pressures in order to judge the reliability of <b>monitoring</b> <b>points,</b> with a wider characterization of the network to identify which land uses and hydrogeological environments are being monitored.

We combined fixed-time interval monitoring at multiple locations with continuous monitoring at one location to determine the effectiveness of conservation practices at multiple locations. In 2000, we established a monitoring program in the Paradise Creek watershed near Moscow, Idaho including 15 -minute average stage height and turbidity at a continuous station and bi-weekly monitoring of discharge (Q) and total suspended sediment (TSS) at eight locations. Event-based sampling of total suspended sediment concentrations and discharge was conducted at the continuous station. We applied standard linear regression to Q and turbidity data at the continuous station and Q and TSS at bi-weekly <b>monitoring</b> <b>points</b> for 2001, 2002, and 2005. Using regression equations, we established 15 -minute time series at the bi-weekly <b>monitoring</b> <b>points.</b> Flow and TSS correlated well when bi-weekly <b>monitoring</b> <b>points</b> were close to the continuous station. Because bi-weekly data collection occurred during low flow conditions, the relationships between the continuous station and each bi-weekly <b>monitoring</b> <b>point</b> exhibited large errors at high flow events. When calculating sediment loads as the product of Q and TSS, the errors associated with regression alone became substantial. Despite these errors, we applied a trend analysis that shows effects of conservation practice...|$|R
