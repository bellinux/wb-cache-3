In microscopic preparations, the cells can be dispersed or form irregular clusters or occasionally chains of varying lengths. In fresh cultures, cells are mobile due to the numerous flagella. Later, the cells lose their mobility, become almost spherical, and produce {{a thick layer of}} mucus, forming the cell capsule. The shape of the cell is affected by the amino acid glycine which is present in the nutrient medium <b>peptone.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1940s [...] and early 1950s, Leslie Collier, an English {{microbiologist}} {{working at the}} Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine, developed a method for producing a heat-stable freeze-dried vaccine in powdered form. Collier added 0.5% phenol to the vaccine {{to reduce the number}} of bacterial contaminants but the key stage was to add 5% <b>peptone</b> to the liquid vaccine before it was dispensed into ampoules. This protected the virus during the freeze drying process. After drying the ampoules were sealed under nitrogen. Like other vaccines, once reconstituted it became ineffective after 1–2 [...] days at ambient temperatures. However, the dried vaccine was 100% effective when reconstituted after 6 months storage at [...] allowing it to be transported to, and stored in, remote tropical areas. Collier's method was increasingly used and, with minor modifications, became the standard for vaccine production adopted by the WHO Smallpox Eradication Unit when it initiated its global Smallpox Eradication Campaign in 1967, at which time 23 of 59 manufacturers were using the Lister strain.|$|E

[...] His discovery was significant as it overturned the previous [...] "hypothesis of resynthesis" [...] which proposed that proteins were broken down into <b>peptones</b> from which proteins were then resynthesized, and helped establish the idea of free amino acids instead of <b>peptones</b> as the building blocks of protein.|$|R

40|$|Blood group {{activity}} was {{proven to be}} a property of the bacterium per se which possesses it, although such {{activity was}} influenced by the cultural environment of the organism. High concentrations of <b>peptones</b> having blood group activity were able to transfer this activity to inactive organisms; however, the conferred activity was proportional to the concentration. As a result of the low concentrations, the blood group activity of <b>peptones</b> was eliminated upon incorporation in culture media, and the activity of the <b>peptones</b> had no effect on the blood group activity levels of microorganisms when grown in these media. Conversely, the vitamin content of culture media did affect blood group active organisms. Multiple vitamins in media decreased the activity levels by blocking the reactive sites of the active organisms on which activity detection depended. Blood group activity levels were highest in media of minimal or no vitamin content. Therefore, it can be concluded that a choice of cultural medium becomes an important factor in the quantitation of bacterial blood group activity...|$|R

40|$|A {{total of}} 114 {{bacterial}} isolates {{were obtained from}} the cecal contents of two mature cecally fistulated horses on a habitat-simulating medium containing 40 % energy-depleted cecal fluid. Of these isolates, 108 were maintained in pure cultures and were tentatively grouped on the basis of cell morphology and physiological characteristics. Gram-negative rods (50. 9 %), gram-positive rods (22. 8 %), and gram-positive cocci (21. 9 %) represented the largest groups isolated from these animals. Fifty isolates were tested for their ability to grow in media containing urea, ammonia, <b>peptones,</b> or amino acids as sole nitrogen sources. None of the isolates had a unique requirement for urea or ammonia since nitrogen derived from <b>peptones,</b> amino acids, or both supported growth as well as did ammonia or urea in a low nitrogen medium. Of the cecal isolates, 18 % were able to use urea for growth, and 20. 5 % were able to grow with ammonia as the sole nitrogen source. All organisms grew in the experimental media containing <b>peptones</b> as the sole nitrogen source. Urease activity was detected in only 2 of 114 isolates tested. The inability of isolates to use urea or ammonia as nitrogen sources may have been a reflection of growth conditions in the habitat-stimulating medium used for isolation, but it could also suggest that many cecal bacteria require nitrogen sources other then ammonia or urea for growth...|$|R
