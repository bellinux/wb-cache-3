5|$|<b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appeal</b> was the cars, I'm {{a bit of}} a buff... And I said– jokingly, of course– that I wouldn't be in The 39 Steps {{unless the}} action {{included}} the famous chase scene in which Hannay is pursued by a biplane. I've always wanted to be chased by a plane like Cary Grant in the movie North by Northwest and I was just delighted when it happened in our version of Steps.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reaction}} to Pyramid Head has been favorable {{because of his}} distinctive appearance and role as an element of James' psyche. Critics cite him as an iconic villain of the Silent Hill series, a favorite among fans, and <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appeal</b> of Silent Hill 2. GameSpot compared Pyramid Head's appearance to Leatherface, the main antagonist of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre series of slasher films, and found him the most terrifying monster in Silent Hill 2. Computerworld named Pyramid Head {{as one of the}} most terrifying villains in computer and video games. GamesRadar felt that the scene in which he rapes the two other monsters was unsettling, since the subject of rape is not often tackled in video games, and disliked the final battle with him because of how anti-climactic it was, in comparison with his role throughout the rest of the game.|$|E
5|$|The Genesis {{library was}} {{initially}} modest, but eventually grew to contain games {{to appeal to}} all types of players. The initial pack-in title was Altered Beast, which was later replaced with Sonic the Hedgehog. Top sellers included Sonic the Hedgehog, its sequel Sonic the Hedgehog 2, and Disney's Aladdin. During development for the console, Sega Enterprises in Japan focused on developing action games while Sega of America was tasked with developing sports games. A large <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appeal</b> of the Genesis library during the console's lifetime was the arcade-based experience of its games, {{as well as more}} difficult entries such as Ecco the Dolphin and sports games such as Joe Montana Football. Compared to its competition, Sega advertised to an older audience by hosting more mature games, including the uncensored version of Mortal Kombat.|$|E
25|$|In April 2008 <b>the</b> Full Bench <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Federal Court upheld <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appeal</b> by <b>the</b> Western Australian and Commonwealth governments against Justice Wilcox's judgment.|$|R
50|$|<b>Appeals</b> from <b>the</b> <b>Appeal</b> Division <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Court are to <b>the</b> High Court <b>of</b> Australia. It was {{previously}} possible to <b>appeal</b> decisions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> or <b>the</b> Court <b>of</b> Criminal <b>Appeal</b> (both <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Appeal</b> Division) to <b>the</b> British Privy Council, but this ceased in 1986 when <b>the</b> Parliament <b>of</b> Australia passed <b>the</b> Australia Act 1986, which barred all such <b>appeals</b> to <b>the</b> Privy Council from Australian courts.|$|R
50|$|Contestants {{range from}} artists to local {{handymen}} and <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> show's <b>appeal</b> is <b>the</b> range <b>of</b> talents <b>the</b> competitors {{bring to the}} challenges.|$|R
25|$|<b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appeal</b> {{of tennis}} {{stems from the}} {{simplicity}} of equipment required for play. Beginners need only a racket and balls.|$|E
25|$|Most players {{also raise}} their arms or {{point at the}} umpire as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appeal.</b> Some players have {{established}} their own trademark appeals as well.|$|E
25|$|In 2016 The National Motor Museum Trust {{are one of}} {{the chosen}} {{charities}} for the newly relaunched London Motor Show where the Sunbeam 350hp will be on display as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appeal.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Justice Wilcox {{found that}} native title {{continues}} to exist within {{an area in}} and around Perth. It was the first judgment recognising native title over a capital city and its surroundings. The claim area itself is <b>part</b> <b>of</b> a much larger area included in the [...] "Single Noongar Claim", covering <b>the</b> south-western corner <b>of</b> Western Australia. An appeal was subsequently lodged and in 2008 <b>the</b> Full Bench <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Federal Court upheld <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appeal</b> by <b>the</b> Western Australian and Commonwealth governments against Justice Wilcox's judgment.|$|R
50|$|As <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2016 <b>appeal,</b> {{supporters}} {{are also being}} encouraged to raise funds by doing something they love, such as hosting a bake sale or quiz night.|$|R
5000|$|At <b>the</b> {{beginning}} <b>of</b> August 2008, 100,000 [...]me domain {{names were}} registered. Sources say <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> worldwide <b>appeal</b> for <b>the</b> [...]me domain extension is the marketing aspect.|$|R
25|$|Lounge {{cars are}} an {{important}} <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appeal</b> of passenger trains when compared to aircraft, buses and cars; there is more space to move around, socialize, eat and drink, and a good view.|$|E
25|$|At {{various points}} and {{lines of the}} -plane, the Tutte {{polynomial}} evaluates to quantities that have been studied {{in their own right}} in diverse fields of mathematics and physics. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appeal</b> of the Tutte polynomial comes from the unifying framework it provides for analysing these quantities.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{characterization}} of the game's avatar will develop through storytelling, characters may also become more functionally powerful by gaining new skills, weapons, and magic. This creates a positive-feedback cycle that is central to most role-playing games: The player grows in power, allowing them to overcome more difficult challenges, and gain even more power. This is <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appeal</b> of the genre, where players experience growing from an ordinary person into a superhero with amazing powers. Whereas other games give the player these powers immediately, the player in a role-playing game will choose their powers and skills as they gain experience.|$|E
50|$|These {{discrepancies}} and inconsistencies {{have been}} presented to the Tokyo High Court by the Sayama Legal Defense Team as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> third <b>appeal</b> for a retrial <b>of</b> <b>the</b> case.|$|R
5000|$|According to {{film critic}} Lee Sang-yong, <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film's <b>appeal</b> {{was due to}} nostalgia, saying, [...] "Radio Star {{attracted}} a big audience among middle-aged people who miss <b>the</b> songs <b>of</b> their times." ...|$|R
50|$|The crude {{technical}} presentation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{show was}} clearly a source <b>of</b> humour and <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> show's <b>appeal.</b> Frenetic and at times inspired performances by Katie captivated the viewer for the brief show.|$|R
500|$|Hodgson's lawyer, Julian Young, {{said the}} confessions had been vital {{information}} {{which could have}} freed his client much earlier, and he was shocked police had not acted on it or passed it on. [...] "If it is true these confessions were not followed up by police or passed on to Mr Hodgson's legal team then, or to me as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appeal,</b> it is surprising and very disappointing. This may raise {{serious questions about the}} way in which the police operated and their failure or unwillingness to disclose evidence. I did not know seven people made admissions. It would have been highly relevant evidence." ...|$|E
500|$|Another line of {{criticism}} of Belldandy relates to the sexual nature of the character, with Belldandy being described by one commentator as a [...] "soft porn goddess". Nevertheless, other commentators have observed that Belldandy might be , but writers such as Gilles Poitras note that the series—far from being soft porn—is in fact a very tender and romantic comedy: the characters {{do no more than}} simply kiss (and that infrequently) {{over the course of the}} series. Newitz suggests that <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appeal</b> of Oh My Goddess! is the romantic nature of the story: [...] "In anime, romantic love is possible because overt sexuality is not". According to Newitz the relationships in romantic anime, such as Oh My Goddess!, are not about consummation but about [...] "sexual innuendo and deferral".|$|E
500|$|The Genesis {{library was}} {{initially}} modest, but eventually grew to contain games {{to appeal to}} all types of players. [...] The initial pack-in title was Altered Beast, which was later replaced with Sonic the Hedgehog in 1991.

5000|$|As <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appeals</b> process, Capt. Gregory Markwell, Meinhold's commander, {{provided}} in a sworn statement his negative assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> impact Meinhold's presence was having. As {{the national debate}} about modifying the rules banning gays and lesbians from the Armed Forces continued, Navy officials opposed to changing the policy made legislators aware of Markwell's statement and two Congressional committees requested it and made it public. Markwell's declaration described how work schedules were being modified to accommodate {{those who did not}} want to work with Meinhold and said that his reinstatement had [...] "reduced morale, efficiency and mission focus" [...] and [...] "struck a discordant note with the troops." ...|$|R
50|$|On July 29, the BC Lions {{played the}} Winnipeg Blue Bombers in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local <b>appeal</b> was <b>the</b> {{presence}} on three former University of Iowa stars, Kenny Ploen and Ray Jauch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Blue Bombers, and Willie Fleming <b>of</b> <b>the</b> BC Lions.|$|R
5000|$|... "Doctor Who: Children in Need", {{also known}} as [...] "Born Again", is a 7-minute mini-episode <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British science fiction {{television}} series Doctor Who.

500|$|The {{previous}} year's {{race was}} watched by seven million viewers in the United Kingdom alone. [...] Oxford coach Dan Topolski suggested that <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appeal</b> {{was that the}} contest was [...] "absolutely amateur" [...] but still [...] "represents quality". [...] Former Oxford Blue and Olympic gold medallist Jonny Searle agreed, calling the Boat Race [...] "a unique experience". [...] Both Topolski and Searle predicted a close race; Cambridge coach Robin Williams agreed: [...] "We've got to accord Oxford some respect. [...] I think we're again the better crew ... {{but the only way}} to find out is on the water." [...] Penny Chuter, one of the other Oxford coaches, noted [...] "Cambridge have a continuity ... but we have more power this year." [...] Cambridge's boat club president John Carver had earlier withdrawn from the race with injury. [...] Oxford's director of rowing, Steve Royle, said of his crew: [...] "these guys love a scrap." ...|$|E
500|$|Referring to {{the scene}} in which Ben {{seemingly}} fits Sawyer with a lethal pacemaker, Michael Emerson comments Sadistic may be the word, but he doesn't seem to take much relish in it. He's just sort of detached, he looks at it coldly. I sometimes feel like everything to him {{is a sort of}} scientific experiment and he is interested in a dispassionate way in how the experiment runs its course. I think some day if we ever find out what his parentage is, that his parents were people of science. He also described the events as a demonstration that [...] "Ben has more cards than you think; ... he's a step or two ahead, one layer or two deeper than anyone else who is playing the game". The rabbit was a reference to Stephen King's , where King uses a rabbit in a cage with the number8 written on its back as an example for the connection between reader and writer. Emerson said that <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appeal</b> of the scene was that [...] "bunnies look so innocent, and the audience feels so tenderly about them you can feel nothing but beastly being mean to them". But Emerson added the rabbit in the scene had problems reacting to his attempts to scare him [...] "it was unfazed, it barely blinked".|$|E
2500|$|<b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appeal</b> and {{popularity}} of Aran Jumper {{comes from the}} array of myths propagated by Heinz Edgar Kiewe.|$|E
50|$|It is {{commonly}} found on rock {{faces in the}} Sierra Nevadas. The communities often completely cover <b>the</b> exposed surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rock, or form intricate multicolored mosaics with other lichen communities.

40|$|Purpose – <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this paper}} is to report and comment on the High Court ruling on whether Financial Services Authority (FSA) {{disclosures}} are exempt from freedom of information requests. Design/methodology/approach – The paper outlines the facts surrounding the case and comments on the decision. Findings – The High Court allowed <b>the</b> FSA's <b>appeal</b> in respect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Owen <b>appeal</b> and <b>the</b> second <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lewis <b>appeal</b> (that <b>the</b> names <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seven firms investigated by the FSA as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mystery shopping should not be disclosed) but agreed with the Tribunal on <b>the</b> first <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lewis <b>appeal,</b> that <b>the</b> names <b>of</b> <b>the</b> firms subject to the mystery shopping exercise could be disclosed. Originality/value – This appeal shows how two very differently motivated, yet equally well-intentioned, regulatory regimes can come into conflict. Disclosure, Legal decisions...|$|R
50|$|Language {{analysis}} for <b>the</b> determination <b>of</b> origin (LADO) is an instrument used in asylum cases {{to determine the}} national or ethnic origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> asylum seeker, through an evaluation of their language profile. To this end, {{an interview with the}} asylum seeker is recorded and analysed. <b>The</b> analysis consists <b>of</b> an examination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dialectologically relevant features (e.g. accent, grammar, vocabulary and loanwords) in <b>the</b> speech <b>of</b> <b>the</b> asylum seeker. LADO is considered a type of speaker identification by forensic linguists. LADO analyses are usually made at <b>the</b> request <b>of</b> government immigration/asylum bureaux attempting to verify asylum claims, but may also be performed as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appeals</b> process for claims which have been denied; they have frequently been <b>the</b> subject <b>of</b> <b>appeals</b> and litigation in several countries, e.g. Australia, the Netherlands and the UK.|$|R
2500|$|Flashbacks {{are often}} used to recall {{specific}} lessons from Caine's childhood training in the monastery from his teachers, the blind Master Po (Keye Luke) and Master Chen Ming Kan (Philip Ahn). <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appeal</b> of the series was undoubtedly the emphasis laid, via the flashbacks, on the mental and spiritual power that Caine had gained from his rigorous training. In these flashbacks, Master Po calls his young student [...] "Grasshopper" [...] in reference to a scene in the pilot episode: ...|$|E
2500|$|Since {{the coming}} into force of the Civil Procedure Rules, the law has evolved further. [...] In Noble v Owens, the Court of Appeal held that the modern {{position}} {{is that it is}} now not necessary to commence a fresh action to cure a judgment fraudulently obtained. Instead, the powers of the Court of Appeal under CPR 52.10 are sufficiently broad to permit the Court of Appeal to refer the determination of the issue of fraud to a Judge of the High Court as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appeal</b> proceedings, with a consequent saving of costs.|$|E
2500|$|Cody's {{two main}} {{allegations}} against {{his wife were}} that she attempted to poison him on multiple occasions (this allegation was later proved false) and that she made living in North Platte [...] "unbearable and intolerable" [...] for Cody and his guests. The press {{picked up on the}} story immediately, creating a battle between Cody and Frederici's teams of lawyers, both of which seemed to be the better authority on Nebraska divorce law. Divorce laws varied from state to state in the early 1900s. Desertion was the main grounds for divorce, but in some jurisdictions, such as Kansas, divorce could be granted if a spouse was [...] "intolerable." [...] The Victorian ideal of marriage did not allow for divorce in any case, but the move westward forced a change in the expectations of husbands and wives and the ability to remain married. In Lewis and Clark County, Montana, 1867 records show that there were more divorces in that year than marriages. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appeal</b> of the frontier was that [...] "a man cannot keep his wife here." ...|$|E
5000|$|As <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{previous}} <b>appeal,</b> BBC Radio 4's Today programme asked {{listeners to}} create a skin for a DAB Digital Radio to mark <b>the</b> move <b>of</b> <b>the</b> BBC to New Broadcasting House, London. The winning design, by David Hampson, continues to be sold by the company in aid of Children in Need.|$|R
50|$|The Wellington International Ukulele Orchestra is an {{ensemble}} of ukulele players based in Wellington, New Zealand. Apart from a double bass {{the band is}} composed entirely of ukuleles. Their repertoire consists mainly of covers of modern popular music and some ukulele and New Zealand standards. Costumes and comic banter are also <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> WIUO <b>appeal.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> play's <b>appeal</b> {{was that}} it was radical for the time. The play was set inside a Royal Navy {{research}} station near Scapa Flow. The play was not popular with everyone, and not everyone saw the humor in it. It elicited subdued laughs as well as frowns, depending on whether the audience was liberal or conservative.|$|R
