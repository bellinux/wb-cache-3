With an order due out for one of Phyllis Vance's (Phyllis Smith) most important clients, Andy asks for volunteers to step in {{for the day and}} make sure that the order is shipped out. Jim, Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), and Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) take over the process, (however, in a talking-head interview, Kevin states that he will deliberately do a <b>poor</b> <b>job</b> because he did not volunteer and was merely suggested for the job because of his large size), but {{do not know how to}} use the heavy-lifting equipment and balk at the notion of carrying all the heavy boxes by hand. Upon Kevin's suggestion, they create an oil luge to slide the boxes across the floor resulting in a lot of damaged inventory. They retool Kevin's idea throughout the day, resulting in still more damaged inventory, and Phyllis ultimately loses the client.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{examine whether}} women’s tobacco use prior to {{entering}} the US Navy is predictive of subsequent career performance. A priori predictions were that smoking at {{entry into the}} Navy would be related to early attrition, <b>poorer</b> <b>job</b> performance, more disciplinary problems and lower likelihood of re-enlistment. Methods: A prospective cohort analysis of 5487 women entering the US Navy between March 1996 and March 1997 was conducted. Navy attrition/retention and career performance measures, such as time in service, early attrition, type of discharge, misconduct, number of promotions, demotions and unauthorised absences, highest paygrade achieved, and re-enlistment were examined. Results: Compared with never smokers, daily smokers at entry into the US Navy had subsequent career outcomes consistently indicating <b>poorer</b> <b>job</b> performance (eg, early attrition prior to serving a full-term enlistment, {{more likely to have}} a less-than-honourable discharge, more demotions and desertions, lower achieved paygrade and less likely to re-enlist). Other types of smokers consistently fell between never and daily smokers on career outcome measures. Conclusions: For women entering the US Navy, being a daily smoker is a prospective predictor of poorer performance in the Navy.

500|$|One {{negative}} {{review was}} written by Margaret McFadden-Gerber in Magill's Literary Annual, who found the book disappointing and felt that it lacked the power and introspection of Angelou's previous books. At least one reviewer expresses disappointment that Angelou did not use her status to effect any political change in Singin' and Swingin'. Critic Lyman B. Hagen responds to this criticism by stating that Angelou's status during the events she describes in this autobiography did not lend itself {{to that kind of}} advocacy, and that as a person, Angelou had not evolved into the advocate that she would become later in her life. Reviewer John McWhorter finds many of the events Angelou describes throughout all of her autobiographies incoherent and confusing, and in need of further explanation as to her motives and reasons for her behavior. For example, McWhorter suggests that Angelou does a <b>poor</b> <b>job</b> of explaining her reasons for her marriage to Tosh Angelos, as well as their divorce.

The authors, however, implicitly assume no education mismatch in the immigrants’ country of origin labour market.

Kotaku figured that Rare added cheats to make the esoteric and [...] "crushingly tough" [...] Spectrum games tolerable, and the Ars Technica review wished that this [...] "rewind" [...] feature had been extended to the Nintendo 64 titles. Critics liked the Snapshot challenges and Polygon {{reported that they were}} crucial for learning basic game mechanics, though less accessible than those of NES Remix. Reviewers complained that the Spectrum game controls were difficult to decipher. The Ars Technica reviewer thought that the compilation did a <b>poor</b> <b>job</b> of explaining each game's controls, and wondered why Rare did not include introductory or how-to videos. Instead, he turned to YouTube videos and external FAQs before playing each game. Eurogamer and Ars Technica disagreed on the virtues of having the Spectrum emulator replicate the graphical glitches of the original console. Jaz Rignall of USgamer appreciated the added option to save game progress at any time for the Spectrum classics, and wrote that the collection will remind players how difficult games used to be.|$|E

30|$|In {{light of}} the recent EU {{dialogue}} regarding facilitating mobility from EaP countries, we have studied their current migration experiences.

Nonetheless, the differences in terms of sectoral distribution are rather small, although EaP migrants {{are more likely than}} natives to engage in low-skilled occupations.

Job level was also manipulated. It was predicted that more frequent and less justifiable non-task-related thoughts would be associated with attributions of greater boredom, less satisfaction, and <b>poorer</b> <b>job</b> characteristics, especially for higher level jobs.

500|$|Lowell's {{earliest}} poems {{were published}} without remuneration in the Southern Literary Messenger in 1840. He {{was inspired to}} new efforts towards self-support and joined with his friend Robert Carter in founding the literary journal The Pioneer. The periodical was distinguished {{by the fact that}} most of its content was new rather than material that had been previously published elsewhere, and by the inclusion of very serious criticism, which covered not only literature but also art and music. Lowell wrote that it would [...] "furnish the intelligent and reflecting portion of the Reading Public with a rational substitute for the enormous quantity of thrice-diluted trash, in the shape of namby-pamby love tales and sketches, which is monthly poured out to them by many of our popular Magazines." [...] William Wetmore Story noted the journal's higher taste, writing that [...] "it took some stand & appealled to a higher intellectual Standard than our [...] milk or watery namby-pamby Mags with which we are overrun". The first issue of the journal included the first appearance of [...] "The Tell-Tale Heart" [...] by Edgar Allan Poe. Lowell was treated for an eye disease in New York shortly after the first issue, and in his absence Carter did a <b>poor</b> <b>job</b> of managing the journal. The magazine ceased publication after three monthly numbers beginning in January 1843, leaving Lowell $1,800 in debt.

500|$|Other Christian critics {{wrote that}} Avatar has [...] "an {{abhorrent}} New Age, pagan, anti-capitalist worldview that promotes goddess worship {{and the destruction}} of the human race" [...] and suggested that Christian viewers interpret the film as a reminder of Jesus Christ as [...] "the True Avatar". Some of them also suspected Avatar of subversive retelling of the biblical Exodus, by which Cameron [...] "invites us to look at the Bible from the side of Canaanites." [...] Conversely, other commentators concluded that the film promotes theism or panentheism rather than pantheism, arguing that the hero [...] "does not pray to a tree, but through a tree to the deity whom he addresses personally" [...] and, unlike in pantheism, [...] "the film's deity does indeed—contrary to the native wisdom of the Na'vi—interfere in human affairs." [...] Ann Marlowe of Forbes agreed, saying that [...] "though Avatar has been charged with [...] "pantheism", its mythos is just as deeply Christian." [...] Another author suggested that the film's message [...] "leads to a renewed reverence for the natural world—a very Christian teaching." [...] Saritha Prabhu, an Indian-born columnist for The Tennessean, saw the film as a misportrayal of pantheism: [...] "What pantheism is, at least, to me: a silent, spiritual awe when looking (as Einstein said) at the 'beauty and sublimity of the universe', and seeing the divine manifested in different aspects of nature. [...] What pantheism isn't: a touchy-feely, kumbaya vibe as is often depicted. [...] No wonder many Americans are turned off."

[...] The quantity of an employee’s absences does not reflect how dedicated he/she may be to the job and its duties. [...] Especially for blue-collar jobs, accidents can often be a useful indicator of <b>poor</b> <b>job</b> performance, but this is also subject to criterion contamination because situational factors also contribute to accidents. [...] Once again, both types of criterion inadequacies result in reduced validity of the measure.
