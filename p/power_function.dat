30|$|On this account, {{some ideas}} {{regarding}} fundamental properties {{which should be}} met by <b>power</b> <b>functions</b> on time scales were outlined in [15].

However, this approach is limited to settings with the well-defined Laplace transform (see [17]) and suffers by some technical difficulties, connected to the inverse Laplace transform.

2500|$|The {{conduction}} {{of nerve}} impulses {{is an example}} of an all-or-none response. In other words, if a neuron responds at all, then it must respond completely. Greater intensity of stimulation does not produce a stronger signal but can produce a higher frequency of firing. There are different types of receptor responses to stimuli, slowly adapting or tonic receptors respond to steady stimulus and produce a steady rate of firing. These tonic receptors most often respond to increased intensity of stimulus by increasing their firing frequency, usually as a <b>power</b> <b>function</b> of stimulus plotted against impulses per second.

40|$|SUMMARY This paper investigates some modular <b>powering</b> <b>functions</b> {{suitable}} for cryptography. It {{is well known}} that the Rabin encryption function is a 4 -to- 1 mapping and breaking its one-wayness is secure under the factoring assumption. The previously reported encryption schemes using a <b>powering</b> <b>function</b> are variants of either the 4 -to- 1 mapping or higher n-to- 1 mapping, where n> 4. In this paper, we propose an optimized <b>powering</b> <b>function</b> that is a 3 -to- 1 mapping using a p 2 q-type modulus. The onewayness of the proposed <b>powering</b> <b>function</b> is as hard as the infeasibility of the factoring problem. We present an efficient algorithm for computing the decryption for a p 2 q-type modulus, which requires neither modular inversion nor division. Moreover, we construct new provably secure digital signatures as an application of the optimized functions. In order to achieve provable security in the random oracle model, we usually randomize a message using random hashing or padding. However, we have to compute the randomization again if the randomized message is a non-cubic residue element—it is inefficient for long messages. We propose an algorithm that can deterministically find the unique cubic residue element for a randomly chosen element. key words: factoring, RSA, modular <b>powering</b> <b>function,</b> digital signature 1...|$|R
