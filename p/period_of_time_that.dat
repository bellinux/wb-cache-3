5|$|The North Vietnamese {{response}} to {{the threat posed by}} the sensors was swift. If PAVN troops could detect the general location of a sensor, they immediately began to search out others and destroy them. Another response was to simply avoid them. The final evolution of anti-sensor measures was to attempt to deceive them. The chief protection of the sensors proved to be the dense foliage that covered the majority of the logistical system, turning the enemy's chief protection against him. Doubtless, PAVN troops negated the effects of many sensors, but so many of them were sown over such a long <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> the majority survived.|$|E
5|$|Athletes have {{historically}} been willing to take legal and health risks to improve their performance, with some even stating their willingness to risk their lives, as exemplified by research by Mirkin, Goldman and Connor in researching attitudes to the so-called Goldman dilemma. To prevent use of performance-enhancing substances, athletes must submit to drug tests that are conducted {{both in and out}} of competition by anti-doping officials or accredited medical staff. Penalized athletes are susceptible to higher testing upon return to competition. Athletes found to have taken substances on the World Anti-Doping Agency's banned list receive sanctions and may be banned from competition for a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> corresponds to the seriousness of the infraction. However, the use of substances not on the prohibited list may also result in sanctions if the substance is deemed similar to a banned substance in either composition or effect. Athletes may also be sanctioned for missing tests, seeking to avoid testing or tampering with results, refusing to submit to testing, through circumstantial evidence, or confession of use.|$|E

30|$|Alternative {{procedures}} for airway maintenance include endotracheal intubation or cricothyrotomy, and these less invasive procedures cause fewer complications [3, 4]. However, {{it is difficult}} to maintain cricothyrotomy and endotracheal intubation for long <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> is required for relief of postoperative swelling. Therefore, tracheostomy is considered an inevitable procedure, and it is commonly used after oral cancer surgery.|$|R
50|$|The major {{subduction}} zone {{is associated with}} the Pacific and Indian Oceans and is responsible for the volcanic activity associated with the Pacific Ring of Fire.

In the 30 {{days leading up to}} departure, the government of Iraq had blocked access to the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) and had withdrawn cooperation with the UNSCOM monitoring teams. The ship traveled as far west as the Persian Gulf before returning to Pearl Harbor in August 1998.

The only known source of such a requirement is the salamander letter, which is now known to be a forgery.|$|E

This would make it possible to feed enemy radar emitters with false targets, and even directly manipulate enemy sensors. In May 2008, a report in IEEE Spectrum cited European sources claiming that the Syrian air defense network had been deactivated by a secret built-in kill switch activated by the Israelis.|$|E

The Who continue to perform critically acclaimed sets in the 21st century, including highly regarded performances at The Concert For New York City in 2001, the 2004 Isle of Wight Festival, Live 8 in 2005 and the 2007 Glastonbury Festival.|$|E
25|$|Fred's remarkably relaxed, emotionally sterile {{attitude}} towards {{all aspects of}} his crimes had startled {{many members of the}} enquiry team. This had prompted Superintendent John Bennett to seek the assistance of a criminal psychologist in order that they obtained an expert opinion as to Fred's state of mind. Through analysing Fred's conduct throughout the extensive 1994 interviews, this psychologist, Paul Britton, advised Superintendent Bennett that Fred's blasé manner indicated he had committed so many offences over such a long <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> he was now indifferent to the acts of torture, mutilation and murder. Britton added that although an offender of this nature may come to offend less frequently, he would be unlikely to cease killing altogether.|$|E

A recent addition was the Crescent Link Retail Park located in the Waterside with many international chain stores, including Homebase, Currys & PC World (stores combined), Carpet Right, Maplin, Argos Extra, Toys R Us, Halfords, DW Sports (formerly JJB Sports), Pets at Home, Next Home, Starbucks, McDonald's, Tesco Express and M Simply Food. In the short <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> this site has been operational, it has quickly grown to become the second largest retail park in Northern Ireland (second only to Sprucefield in Lisburn). Plans have also been approved for Derry's first Asda store, which will be located at the retail park sharing a unit with Homebase. Sainsbury's also applied for planning permission for a store at Crescent Link, but Environment Minister Alex Attwood turned it down.|$|E
