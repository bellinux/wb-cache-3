30|$|Based on {{the results}} of the linear elastic analyses, it {{appeared}} that the joint design J 3 r, consisting in a central <b>joint</b> <b>piece</b> adhesively bonded to round-based members, showed the lowest peak shear strain value within the adhesive layer, suggesting that it is the strongest of the joint designs analyzed in this study. The results of the non-linear analyses lead to a different conclusion, with the joint design J 3 s, consisting in a central <b>joint</b> <b>piece</b> adhesively bonded to square-based members, showing the highest failure load. Relatively high discrepancies exist between the results of both analyses, with the non-linear analyses showing performances that are 1.6 times higher than those shown by the linear elastic analyses, suggesting that the linear models in their current state cannot predict these performances accurately enough. Taking into account the volume of the central <b>joint</b> <b>piece</b> in each of the joint designs, it appeared that, relatively to the least performant design, the increase in performance of each design does not always match the increase in weight of the <b>joint</b> <b>piece</b> volume. From the results of the linear elastic analyses, the joint designs J 3 s and J 3 r show the highest increase in performance relatively to the increase in volume, therefore we can consider them as being the most efficient of the joint designs analyzed in this study. From the results of the non-linear analyses, it appears that the joint design J 3 s performs better than the joint design J 3 r while also being lighter, which suggest that J 3 s is the most efficient one. Even though the performances and weights of the joint designs J 3 s and J 3 r are very close, their manufacturing requirements are different and favor J 3 r for being easier to manufacture if additive manufacturing is not available to the manufacturer.|$|R

30|$|The {{third group}} of joint designs, called J 3 s and J 3 r for the {{variants}} using square-based and round-based members respectively, and presented in Fig.  2 c, consists {{of having a}} central <b>joint</b> <b>piece</b> that completely surrounds the members and is adhesively bonded to them, similarly to the lugged steel frame construction used to build bicycle frames. The main advantage of these joint designs {{is that they can}} be used for three-dimensional trusses, since there is no restriction due to the flat nature of the central <b>joint</b> <b>piece</b> as there is in the two previous joint designs. Furthermore, if the material selected for the central joint is isotropic, it could mitigate the issues related to out-of-plane stresses that can arise in three-dimensional structures and be problematic for fiber-reinforced components. It is expected that these joint designs are stronger than the J 1 and J 2 designs, due to the adhesive overlap completely surrounding the members.|$|R
30|$|It is to {{be noted}} that the {{materials}} for the adhesive and members are not taken into account in this discussion.

30|$|From {{the results}} of the linear elastic analyses, it appears that the joints designs J 3 s and J 3 r show a much better {{performance}} than the joint designs J 1, J 2 s and J 2 r, with an increase in performance (with respect to J 1) of 261 and 267 % respectively for J 3 s and J 3 r, against a slight decrease of performance (with respect to J 1) of 0.5 and 1.5 % respectively for J 2 s and J 2 r. This suggests that the family of joint designs consisting of a full central <b>joint</b> <b>piece</b> that completely surrounds the members offer a much greater performance than the family of joint designs consisting of one or several plates. Those results were to be expected since the joint designs that completely surround the member have a larger surface of contact between the member, adhesive and central <b>joint</b> <b>piece</b> than the <b>joints</b> designs using one or several plates, this increase in adhesive surface resulting in lower stress concentrations within the adhesive and therefore an increased joint performance. Furthermore, those results show very small differences between the performances of the square-based and round-based versions of each design, suggesting that the choice of the shape of the member’s cross section between square and round does not {{have a significant impact on}} the joint performance. The shear stress and peel stress distributions in the adhesive layer, displayed in Figs.  8 and 9, confirm the conclusion made above, by showing stresses that are significantly lower in the adhesive layers of joints J 3 s and J 3 r than those of joints J 1, J 2 s and J 2 r, as well as showing very small differences between stress distributions of the square-based and round-based version of each joint design.|$|R
30|$|Further {{numerical}} work, {{as well as}} experimental work, {{is needed}} to better understand and model the behavior of these promising joint designs. Obtaining a model that can predict {{the strength of a}} joint while being relatively low on computational cost would allow for an optimization of said joint designs, by varying parameters such as the overlap length or the amount of material in the central <b>joint</b> <b>piece,</b> to obtain a good balance between strength and low weight.|$|R

We presented singing performances, by a female duo. The main findings were as follows: (1) the melody part (soprano) attracted more visual attention than the accompaniment part (alto) throughout the <b>piece,</b> (2) <b>joint</b> attention emerged when the singers shifted their gazes toward their co-performer, suggesting that inter-performer gazing interactions that play a spotlight role mediated performer-audience visual interaction, and (3) musical part (melody or accompaniment) strongly influenced the total duration of gazes among audiences, while the spotlight effect of gaze was limited to just after the singers’ gaze shifts...|$|R

30|$|Traditionally in {{structural}} engineering, {{the efficiency}} of a joint is characterized as {{the ratio of the}} load that the joint can support before failure, over the load that the members can support before failure.

30|$|If {{additive}} manufacturing processes {{are available to}} the manufacturer, more sophisticated shapes than a full round hole can be made easily. The selection of the best joint design can then be based on weight and performance only, since producing either shape for the central <b>joint</b> <b>piece</b> will not make {{a significant difference in}} the manufacturing cost. In this case, based on the discussion of the previous section, the joint design J 3 s is the best suited for an application in trusses.

When welding thicker metals, a double-V joint requires less filler material because there are two narrower V-joints compared to a wider single-V joint. Also the double-V joint helps compensate for warping forces. With a single-V joint, stress tends to warp the piece in one direction when the V-joint is filled, but with a double-V-joint, there are welds on both sides of the material, having opposing stresses, straightening the material.|$|R

Results suggest that this novel sociometric approach can complement traditional measures based on undirected networks and expand insights into coauthoring patterns such as the hierarchy of collaboration among scholars. As another form of validation, we also show how our approach accurately detects prominent scholars in the Psychometric Society affiliated with the journal.
