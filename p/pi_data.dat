40|$|The Standard-Model {{interpretation}} of the ratios of charged and neutral B-> pi K rates, R_c and R_n, respectively, points towards a puzzling picture. Since these observables are affected significantly by colour-allowed electroweak (EW) penguins, this "B -> pi K puzzle" could be a manifestation of new physics in the EW penguin sector. Performing the analysis in the R_n-R_c plane, which is very suitable for monitoring various effects, we demonstrate that we may, in fact, move straightforwardly to the experimental region in this plane through an enhancement of the relevant EW penguin parameter q. We derive analytical bounds for q {{in terms of a}} quantity L, that measures the violation of the Lipkin sum rule, and point out that strong phases around 90 deg are favoured by the data, in contrast to QCD factorisation. The B -> pi K modes imply a correlation between q and the angle gamma that in the limit of negligible rescattering effects and colour suppressed EW penguins depends only on the value of L. Concentrating on a minimal flavour-violating new-physics scenario with enhanced Z^ 0 penguins, we find that the current experimental values on B -> X_s mu^+ mu^- require roughly L <b>pi</b> K <b>data</b> give L = 5. 7 +- 2. 4, L has either to move to smaller values once the B -> <b>pi</b> K <b>data</b> improve or new sources of flavour and CP violation are needed. In turn, the enhanced values of L seen in the B -> <b>pi</b> K <b>data</b> could be accompanied by enhanced branching ratios for rare decays. Most interesting {{turns out to be the}} correlation between the B -> pi K modes and BR(K^+ -> pi^+ nu nu), with the latter depending approximately on a single "scaling" variable L̅= L (|V_ub/V_cb|/ 0. 086) ^ 2. 3.

40|$|The {{measurements}} of B -> pi K decays {{have been in}} disagreement with the predictions of the Standard Model (SM) for some time. In this paper, we perform an update of this puzzle using the latest (2008) data. We find that the situation has become far less clear. A fit to the B -> <b>pi</b> K <b>data</b> alone suggests the presence of new physics (NP). Indeed, if one adds a constraint on the weak phase gamma coming from independent measurements [...] the SM fit [...] one finds that the fit is poor. On the other hand, it is not terrible. If one is willing to accept some deficiencies in the fit, {{it can be argued}} that the SM can explain the B -> <b>pi</b> K <b>data.</b> If one assumes NP, it is found to be present only in the electroweak penguin amplitude, as before.

Vehicle tracking by automated machine-to-machine (M 2 M) communication over cellular wireless networks {{will be a}} key component in future "intelligent transport" systems in which existing transport infrastructure is used more efficiently, resulting in reduced traffic congestion, improved fuel efficiency, etc. Furthermore, as transport becomes electrified, M 2 M communication will enable the impact of electric vehicles (EVs) on the electricity distribution network to be managed. In this research, we have implemented a Raspberry <b>Pi</b> based <b>data</b> logging system (DLS) operating over a commercial 4 G wireless network. The DLS sends trip information, such as state of charge (SoC) and location of EVs to a remote server at regular intervals. We also {{address the question of}} scalability of the wireless DLS, and report both numerical simulations and analytical results showing that up to 250 vehicles can be supported per base station before communication delays and blocking disrupt system operation. Lastly, we implement a neural-network-based intelligent decision-making system to utilise the M 2 M logged data for charge scheduling and load management of EVs in the power grid.
