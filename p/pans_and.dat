Stephenson and Griffin spent time at Watford Hospital, where they underwent {{a crash course in}} nursing basics, including handling bed <b>pans</b> <b>and</b> learning to make beds with hospital corners. Irving observed coronary artery bypass surgery performed at Papworth and Middlesex Hospital, while French shadowed a consultant and registrar at Papworth Hospital, observing a heart bypass and lung biopsy procedure. Young explained that viewers believe in Casualty and trust the show to be realistic, and that he wanted Holby City to be the same in that regard.|$|E
5|$|In the laboratory, {{platinum}} wire {{is used for}} electrodes; platinum <b>pans</b> <b>and</b> supports are used in thermogravimetric analysis because of the stringent requirements of chemical inertness upon heating to high temperatures (~1000°C). Platinum is used as an alloying agent for various metal products, including fine wires, noncorrosive laboratory containers, medical instruments, dental prostheses, electrical contacts, and thermocouples. Platinum-cobalt, an alloy of roughly three parts platinum and one part cobalt, is used to make relatively strong permanent magnets. Platinum-based anodes are used in ships, pipelines, and steel piers.|$|E

5|$|Around {{the time}} of the American Civil War, syrup makers started using large, flat sheet metal pans as they were more {{efficient}} for boiling than heavy, rounded iron kettles, because of a greater surface area for evaporation. Around this time, cane sugar replaced maple sugar as the dominant sweetener in the US; as a result, producers focused marketing efforts on maple syrup. The first evaporator, used to heat and concentrate sap, was patented in 1858. In 1872, an evaporator was developed that featured two <b>pans</b> <b>and</b> a metal arch or firebox, which greatly decreased boiling time. Around 1900, producers bent the tin that formed the bottom of a pan into a series of flues, which increased the heated surface area of the pan and again decreased boiling time. Some producers also added a finishing pan, a separate batch evaporator, as a final stage in the evaporation process.|$|E
5|$|Spacey was Mendes' {{first choice}} {{for the role of}} Lester, though DreamWorks had urged the {{director}} to consider better-known actors; similarly, the studio suggested several actors for the role of Carolyn until Mendes offered the part to Bening without DreamWorks' knowledge. Principal photography took place between December 1998 and February 1999 on soundstages at the Warner Bros. backlot in Burbank, California, and on location in Los Angeles. Mendes' dominant style was deliberate and composed; he made extensive use of static shots and slow <b>pans</b> <b>and</b> zooms to generate tension. Cinematographer Conrad Hall complemented Mendes' style with peaceful shot compositions to contrast with the turbulent on-screen events. During editing, Mendes made several changes that gave the film a less cynical tone than the script.|$|E
5|$|Screenwriter Gidding, who {{had worked}} with {{director}} Wise on the 1958 film I Want to Live!, began a six-month write of the script after reading the book, which Wise had given to him. He perceived the book to be more about mental breakdown than ghosts, and although he was informed after meeting author Shirley Jackson that it was very much a supernatural novel, elements of mental breakdown were introduced into the film. The film was shot at MGM-British Studios in the United Kingdom on a budget of US$1.05 million, with exteriors and the grounds shot at Ettington Park (now the Ettington Park Hotel) in the village of Ettington, Warwickshire. Julie Harris was cast by Wise who found her ideal for the psychologically fragile Eleanor, though during production she suffered from depression and had an uneasy relationship with her co-stars. The interior sets were by Elliot Scott, credited by Wise as instrumental in the making of The Haunting. They were designed to be brightly lit, with no dark corners or recesses, and decorated in a Rococo style; all the rooms had ceilings to create a claustrophobic effect on film. Numerous devices and tricks were used in the filming. Wise used a 30mm anamorphic, wide-angle lens Panavision camera that was not technically ready for use and caused distortions. It was only given to Wise on condition that he sign a memorandum in which he acknowledged that the lens was imperfect. Wise and cinematographer Davis Boulton planned sequences that kept the camera moving, utilizing low-angle takes, and incorporating unusual <b>pans</b> <b>and</b> tracking shots.|$|E

Mixing ratios of <b>PAN</b> <b>and</b> a variety of other molecules are more abundant in the free troposphere compared to the boundary layer. Coincident <b>PAN</b> <b>and</b> O 3 atmospheric structures suggest that phenomena that define PAN also define the corresponding O 3 behavior. Model calculations, correlations between NO(y) and anthropogenic tracers, and the compositions of NO(y) itself suggest that the Arctic/sub-Arctic reactive nitrogen measured during ABLE 3 A is predominantly of anthropogenic origin with a minor component from the stratosphere...|$|R
40|$|Remote sensing {{image fusion}} (or pan-sharpening) aims at {{generating}} high resolution multi-spectral (MS) image from inputs {{of a high}} spatial resolution single band panchromatic (<b>PAN)</b> image <b>and</b> a low spatial resolution multi-spectral image. In this paper, a {{deep convolutional neural network}} with two-stream inputs respectively for <b>PAN</b> <b>and</b> MS images is proposed for remote sensing image pan-sharpening. Firstly the network extracts features from <b>PAN</b> <b>and</b> MS images, then it fuses them to form compact feature maps that can represent both spatial and spectral information of <b>PAN</b> <b>and</b> MS images, simultaneously. Finally, the desired high spatial resolution MS image is recovered from the fused features using an encoding-decoding scheme. Experiments on Quickbird satellite images demonstrate that the proposed method can fuse the <b>PAN</b> <b>and</b> MS image effectively. Comment: MMM 201...|$|R

40|$|Vehicle {{information}} {{is useful in}} many fields. In this paper, a technique is presented to extract vehicle information from single pass QuickBird images. While passing a target area, the satellite acquires panchromatic (<b>PAN)</b> <b>and</b> multi-spectral (MS) images simultaneously. Because of a small time interval difference between the <b>PAN</b> <b>and</b> MS images, it is theoretically possible to extract two sets of vehicle ground positions from the <b>PAN</b> <b>and</b> MS images, respectively, to identify {{whether or not a}} vehicle is in motion, and to calculate the vehicle’s velocity and direction. Practically, however, this extraction and calculation are challenging. Since the time interval is very short, a small error in information extraction will result in an unacceptably large error in the calculated vehicle position and velocity. Another challenge is that satellite image pairs (<b>PAN</b> <b>and</b> MS) {{do not have the same}} resolution. Therefore, traditional change detection techniques are incapable of providing reliable results, due to varying scales and relief distortions in the co-registered images or slight pixel shifts in the orthorectified images caused by resampling of the <b>PAN</b> <b>and</b> MS images. In order to avoid these errors, this research presents an algorithm through which a vehicle’s ground positions can be directly calculated from the raw <b>PAN</b> <b>and</b> MS images. Experiments demonstrate that it is feasible to use this technique to extract vehicle information from high-resolution images obtained from a single satellite pass...|$|R
