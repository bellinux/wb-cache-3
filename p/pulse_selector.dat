40|$|Construction of {{the laser}} {{is one of the}} most {{important}} physical advances of modern times. Its use in practice is extremely common and desirable, therefore, it is necessary to push the boundaries of possibilities of this technique still further. Lasers generating ultrashort pulses are widely used in material research for the study of nonlinear effects and ultrafast processes. These lasers have a high repetition rate, which must be reduced for some applications. In this thesis we used femtosecond titanium -sapphire laser from Spectra Physics, whose repetition rate is 80 MHz. The aim of this thesis is to reduce this frequency by using a <b>pulse</b> <b>selector.</b> The key mechanism that utilizes the <b>pulse</b> <b>selector</b> is an acoustooptic modulator that is based on the principle of Bragg diffraction and it is able to select pulses with a frequency of 1 Hz- 4 MHz. The end of thesis is measurement of the properties of this selector and its optimization...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the project was}} to develop a fast shutter mechanism to allow separation of a single pulse of x-rays out of the given time structure of the APS. Technological challenges in developing this device range from engineering of ultra high strength alloys, mechanical shape development for optimal strength, coupling such materials to motorized shafts, magnetic suspension of high velocity rotors in combination with phase pick up and excursion monitoring, resonance control and jitter-free electronics. The <b>pulse</b> <b>selector</b> was delivered, integrated into the x-ray diffraction environment and tested. The researchers developed an acoustic delay line as protection against air inrushes and associated failure of the rotor and thin diamond windows for maximum x-ray transparency. Design goals were reached or exceeded and practical experience with the device began in March 2000...|$|E
40|$|Picosecond x ray pulses are {{extracted}} with a {{phase locked}} x ray <b>pulse</b> <b>selector</b> at 1. 25 MHz repetition rate from the pulse trains of the accelerator driven multiuser x ray source BESSY II preserving the peak brilliance at high pulse purity. The system {{consists of a}} specially designed in vacuum chopper wheel rotating with amp; 8776; 1 kHz angular frequency. The wheel is driven in an ultrahigh vacuum and is levitated on magnetic bearings being capable of withstanding high centrifugal forces. Pulses are picked by 1252 high precision slits of 70 amp; 956;m width on the outer rim of the wheel corresponding to a temporal opening window of the chopper of 70 ns. We demonstrate how the electronic phase stabilization of 2 ns together with an arrival time jitter of the individual slits of the same order of magnitude allows us to pick short single bunch x ray pulses out of a 200 ns ion clearing gap in a multibunch pulse train as emitted from a synchrotron facilit...|$|E
40|$|A new {{laser-based}} and time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) {{detection system}} which allows easy and fast tuning of excitation wavelengths over {{a broad range}} from 240 to 1300 nm, with small gaps from 335 to 360 nm and 660 to 720 nm, has been built. The unique combination of a mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser, an optical parametric oscillator, <b>pulse</b> <b>selectors,</b> and harmonic generators delivers ultrafast laser pulses (1 - 2 ps) with variable repetition rates and excitation wavelengths. Performance characteristics of the laser system at different excitation wavelengths are reported and the TCSPC setup, which {{is characterized by a}} total instrument response function of 25 ps full width at half maximum, is described. Typical TCSPC measurements demonstrate the capability of the system of deriving decay or species associated excitation spectra. (C) 2001 American Institute of Physics. status: publishe...|$|R
