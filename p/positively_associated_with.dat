5|$|Aquatic life ties North American river otters almost {{exclusively}} to permanent watersheds. The river otters favor bog lakes with banked shores containing semiaquatic mammal burrows and lakes with beaver lodges. The otters avoid water bodies with gradually sloping shorelines of sand or gravel. In Maine, use of watersheds by river otters is negatively associated with the proportion of mixed hardwood-softwood stands in forested areas adjacent to waterways. However, it is <b>positively</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> the number of beaver flowages, watershed length, and average shoreline diversity. In Idaho, river otters prefer valley habitats over mountainous terrain, and they select valley streams over valley lakes, reservoirs, and ponds. Log jams are heavily used when present. In Florida, inhabitation of North American river otters is lowest in freshwater marshes, intermediate in salt marshes, and highest in swamp forests. During the dry season, they will recede from the marshland and move to permanent ponds, where water is available and food is in greater supply. In Idaho and Massachusetts, ecological elements preferred for latrine sites include large conifers, points of land, beaver bank dens and lodges, isthmuses, mouths of permanent streams, or any object that protrudes from the water.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{distinct}} populations of sarus cranes in South-east Asia: the northern population in China and Myanmar, {{and the southern}} population in Cambodia and Vietnam. The sarus used to extend to Thailand and further east into the Philippines, but may now be extinct in both these countries. In 2011, 24 captive bred cranes raised from five original founders were reintroduced into Thailand. In Australia they are found only in the northern parts, and are partly migratory in some areas. The global range has shrunk and the largest occupied area is now in India. With marshlands largely destroyed, these cranes are increasingly dependent on wet paddy fields in India. Although now found mainly at a low elevation on the plains, there are some historical records from highland marshes further north in Harkit Sar and Kahag in Kashmir. The sarus crane breeds in some high elevation regions such as near the Pong Dam in Himachal Pradesh, where populations may be growing in response to increasing rice cultivation along the reservoir. In rice-dominated districts of Uttar Pradesh, sarus crane abundance (estimated as occupancy) was highest in the western districts, intermediate in the central districts, and minimal in the eastern districts. Sarus crane abundance was <b>positively</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> percentage of wetlands on the landscape, and negatively with the percentage of area under rice cultivation.|$|E
40|$|I {{examined}} the environmental relationships of feathermosses, vascular plants, and mat-forming lichens in lodgepole pine forests. Seventy-two mature forest plots were surveyed using microhabitat-scale sampling for functional group abundance, canopy characteristics, nutrient availability, soil texture, topography, relative humidity and air temperature. Feathermosses <b>positively</b> <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> canopy closure, afternoon shade, nitrogen or base-cation availability, duff thickness, fine soil texture, and water-receiving positions. Lichens <b>positively</b> <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> total irradiance, aluminum:calcium availability, water-shedding positions, and base-cation or nitrogen deficiency. Vascular plants have higher within-group variability, but <b>positively</b> <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> direct irradiance, afternoon shade, canopy heterogeneity, duff thickness, nutrient availability, alkalinity, and fine soil texture. Lichen patches {{are characterized by}} lower atmospheric moisture than vascular plant or feathermoss patches, but microclimate is more strongly <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> macroclimate and soil than canopy or understory vegetation. Competition among functional groups probably occurs but is unimportant environmental filtering and initial floristics are more likely mechanism of niche partitioning. [...] P. i.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the role of personal and collective work identity (including emotion and cognition components), in predicting work motivation (operationalized as work self-determined motivation) and organizational justice (operationalized as organizational pay justice). Digitized questionnaires were distributed by e-mail to 2905 members, teachers, of a Swedish trade union. A total of 768 individuals answered the questionnaire and by that participated in this study. Personal- compared to collective work identity was shown to <b>positively</b> <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> self-determined motivation accounted for by the emotion component of personal work identity. Collective compared to personal work identity was reported to <b>positively</b> <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> organizational pay justice accounted for by the cognition component of collective work identity. All this suggests that both work-related motivation and organizational justice might be, to some extent, accounted for by the psychological mechanisms of work identity and that, as predicted, different types of work identity, play different significant roles in predicting motivation and justice at work. More precisely, the emotion component of work identity was more pronounced in personal work-bonding relationships, and the cognitive component, of work identity in contrast, was more pronounced in collective work-bonding relationships...|$|R

After adjusting for confounders, male sex was <b>associated</b> <b>positively</b> <b>with</b> IgA levels and negatively with IgM levels.

40|$|Pre-operative kidney {{volume is}} an {{independent}} predictor of glomerular filtration rate in renal cell carcinoma patients. Compensatory renal growth (CRG) can ensue prior to nephrectomy in parallel to tumor growth and benign parenchyma loss. We aimed to test whether renal metabolite abundances significantly <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> CRG, suggesting a causative relationship. Tissue metabolomics data from 49 patients, with a median age of 60 years, were previously collected and the pre-operative fold-change of their contra to ipsi-lateral benign kidney volume served as a surrogate for their CRG. Contra-lateral kidney volume fold-change within a 3. 3 +/- 2. 1 years follow-up interval {{was used as a}} surrogate for long-term CRG. Using a multivariable statistical model, we identified metabolites whose abundances significantly <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> CRG. Our analysis found 13 metabolites in the benign (e. g. L-urobilin, Variable Influence in Projection, VIP, score = 3. 02, adjusted p = 0. 017) and 163 metabolites in the malignant (e. g. 3 -indoxyl-sulfate, VIP score = 1. 3, adjusted p = 0. 044) tissues that significantly <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> CRG. Benign/tumor fold change in metabolite abundances revealed three additional metabolites <b>with</b> that significantly <b>positively</b> <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> CRG (e. g. p-cresol sulfate, VIP score = 2. 945, adjusted p = 0. 033). At the pathway level, we show that fatty-acid oxidation is highly enriched with metabolites whose benign tissue abundances strongly <b>positively</b> <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> CRG, both pre-operatively and long term, whereas in the tumor tissue significant enrichment of dipeptides and benzoate (positive association), glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, lysolipid and nucleotide sugar pentose (negative associations) sub-pathways, were observed. These data suggest that specific biological processes in the benign {{as well as in the}} tumor parenchyma strongly influence compensatory renal growth...|$|R

One hundred and thirty young adults residing in Israel filled out measures assessing Anorexia (drive for thinness), Bulimia, perceived control, and EI (two measures).

On the other hand, more conscientious people are better at managing conflict and tend to provoke fewer disagreements, perhaps because they elicit less criticism due to their well-controlled and responsible behavior.|$|E
