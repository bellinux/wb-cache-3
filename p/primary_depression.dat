40|$|Abstract: The {{importance}} of managing depression as a chronic illness to prevent relapse is established, and models for providing long-term {{care in the}} primary care setting are needed. There has been very limited research into <b>primary</b> care <b>depression</b> relapse prevention programmes, but there is support {{for a range of}} treatment strategies that contribute to relapse prevention. Research suggests that a <b>primary</b> care <b>depression</b> relapse prevention programme needs to provide an intensive, multifaceted and integrated approach, and include psychosocial treatments. It may be possible to take components of proven treatments and design novel preventive treatments. This paper outlines the development of a <b>primary</b> care <b>depression</b> relapse prevention programme called 'Keeping the blues away'. The programme involves a multifaceted approach which incorporates a range of evidence-based psychosocial strategies, and enables a novel treatment approach that can be tailored to the individual patient. 'Keeping the blues away' is currently undergoing a cluster randomised trial. It is optimally placed within the 'Better Outcomes in Mental Health Care' initiative, and potentially provides a model for delivering accessible long-term depression care in the Australian primary care setting. Research about programmes such as 'Keeping the blues away' is needed to inform practice and policy...|$|R

40|$|Although the {{pathophysiology}} {{of depression}} {{is not fully}} understood in either <b>primary</b> <b>depression</b> (i. e., no known neuropathology related to depression) or secondary depression (i. e., neuropathologic disorder that leads to depres-sion), {{a number of studies}} have begun to identify aspects of the pathophysiology of both primary and secondary depression. This article reviews the findings of studies examining the pathophysiology of depression following stroke, Parkinson’s disease, or Huntington’s disease and compares them to findings in <b>primary</b> <b>depression.</b> Studies exam-ining glucose metabolic rates or blood flow changes in regional brain areas found that stroke, Parkinson’s disease, and Huntington’s disease, as well as <b>primary</b> <b>depression,</b> were all associated with decreased activity or brain lesions in the orbital frontal cortex and basal ganglia. There were also abnormalities noted in the basal temporal lobes, cingulate cortex, and thalamus in some but not all disorders. Studies in stroke have also noted depletions of sero-tonin receptors in left temporal cortex associated with depression. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the pathophysiology of secondary and <b>primary</b> <b>depression</b> involves the dysfunction of one or more of the corti-cal-basal ganglia-thalamic neuronal loops. This dysfunction may be mediated by decreased serotonin release. These studies may ultimately lead to more focused and specific treatments. (J Geriatr Psychiatry Neurol 1999; 12 : 128 - 136) ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectivesClinical {{trials and}} {{community-based}} studies often include the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale (CES-D) {{as a measure}} of depression outcome. We compared responses to symptom-related items on the CES-D by depressed stroke and primary-care patients for several purposes: 1) to illustrate the use of Item Response Theory (IRT) -based (Rasch) models for comparing scale functioning across different patient subgroups; and 2) to inform clinicians and outcome researchers about scale functioning and depressive symptomatology in stroke- compared with <b>primary</b> care-based <b>depression.</b> MethodsTwo data sources were analyzed, including 32 depressed patients who were 3 months poststroke, and 366 depressed primary-care patients. Presence of depression was based on a CES-D score 16 or higher. Rasch models were used to assess item fit and compare item hierarchies between depressed primary-care and stroke patients. ResultsItem hierarchies were similar for poststroke <b>depression</b> and <b>primary</b> care-based <b>depression.</b> Interpersonal disruption items were the most difficult to endorse for both groups. No items misfit the scale in primary-care depression. Items relating to restless sleep, unfriendliness, and crying slightly misfit the scale in stroke patients, that is, may measure a different trait. Differential item functioning (DIF) between the groups was identified for items relating to appetite, restless sleep, crying, and feeling disliked. ConclusionsResults generally supported the use of the CES-D as measure of depression outcome, particularly in <b>primary</b> care-based <b>depression.</b> DIF may imply that slightly different clusters of depressive symptoms are reported by depressed stroke patients compared with primary care, but this is conjectural given the small stroke sample size and the same items have been previously associated with bias in studies of large nonstroke samples.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Personality traits {{have been}} {{associated}} with <b>primary</b> <b>depression.</b> However, it is not known whether this association takes place in the case of depression comorbid with fibromyalgia. OBJECTIVE: The authors investigated the association between a current major depressive episode and temperament traits (e. g., harm avoidance). METHOD: A sample of 69 adult female patients with fibromyalgia was assessed with the Temperament and Character Inventory. Psychiatric diagnoses were assessed with the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview severity of depressive symptomatology with the Beck Depression Inventory, and anxiety symptomatology with the IDATE-state and pain intensity with a visual analog scale. RESULTS: A current major depressive episode was diagnosed in 28 (40. 5 %) of the patients. They presented higher levels of harm avoidance and lower levels of cooperativeness and self-directedness compared with non-depressed patients, which is consistent with the Temperament and Character Inventory profile of subjects with <b>primary</b> <b>depression.</b> However, in contrast to previous results in <b>primary</b> <b>depression,</b> no association between a major depressive episode and self-transcendence was found. CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight specific features of depression in fibromyalgia subjects and may prove important for enhancing the diagnosis and prognosis of depression in fibromyalgia patients...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} a ‘secondary deflation’ was {{developed}} in the 1930 s by the German economist Wilhelm Röpke, who saw it as something different from a normal <b>depression.</b> While a <b>primary</b> deflation is a necessary reaction to the inflation from a boom period, a secondary deflation is independent and economically purposeless. Röpke argued that secondary depressions occurred in the US, Germany, France and Switzerland during the 1930 s, but was vague on what made them follow <b>primary</b> <b>depressions.</b> Recently, the Taiwanese–American economist Richard C. Koo has claimed to have discovered the ‘Holy Grail of macroeconomics’, that is, what made the Great Depression so deep and long. During the Great Depression, the bursting of the asset price bubble resulted in private sectors having more debt than assets; as they shifted from maximising profits to minimising debt, the consequent debt deflation shrank the economy. According to Koo, Western economies today are suffering from a similar ‘balance sheet recession’. Strengthened by the notion of a balance sheet recession, Röpke's long-lost insights might advance our understanding of the business cycle in general and the present crisis in the US and the Eurozone in particular...|$|R

40|$|Rationale: Co-morbidity of {{mood and}} anxiety {{disorders}} is often ignored in pharmacotreatment outcome studies and this complicates {{the interpretation of}} treatment response. The clinical trials are usually based on single categories from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). Objectives: The present study is a first attempt to differentiate the responses to anti depressants using a design that differs from that used in previous clinical trials. To avoid bias due to co-morbidity, we included patients with any DSM-III-R diagnosis of mood or anxiety disorder for which antidepressant treatment was indicated. We also explored {{the role of the}} diagnosis at the first episode in the efficacy of the different anti depressants. Methods: A total of 92 outpatients with a mood and/or anxiety disorder were randomly assigned to treatment with imipramine or fluvoxamine in a 6 -week study. The diagnosis at the first episode - or primary diagnosis - was available for 78 patients, 40 with a <b>primary</b> <b>depression</b> and 38 with a primary anxiety disorder. Results: Analyses using the MIXED procedure for repeated measures showed no general differences between treatment with imipramine and treatment with fluvoxamine. When the primary diagnoses were taken into consideration, differentiation occurred. Patients with <b>primary</b> <b>depression</b> showed better responses to imipramine than to fluvoxamine. The assumption that patients with primary anxiety disorder would respond better to fluvoxamine than imipramine was observed for only the Clinical Global Impression. Conclusions: The results suggest that the nature of the first illness episode may be more valuable than the DSM categories of mood or anxiety disorders, which may lend support to the concept of primary versus secondary depression for purposes of differentiating treatment responses.
