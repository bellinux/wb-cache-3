50|$|Induced (traumatic) resin {{in white}} spruce leaders {{resistant}} or {{susceptible to the}} white <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> was analyzed for volatile terpenes and diterpene resin acids after simulated white <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> damage (Tomlin et al. 2000). Leaders from 331 trees were wounded just below the apical bud with a 1-mm diameter drill, coinciding with the natural time of weevil oviposition in the spring. Leaders were removed in the autumn, and the bark and xylem from {{the upper and lower}} regions of the leader extracted and analyzed by gas chromatography. Unwounded trees had low amounts of resin in xylem compared with bark. In response to wounding, volatile terpenes and diterpene resin acids increased in the upper xylem (area of wounding), with resistant trees showing a greater increase than susceptible trees. Wounding caused monoterpenes in particular to decrease in the lower region of the leader (away from the drilled area) in greater amounts in susceptible trees than in resistant trees. In response to wounding, the proportion of monoterpene to resin acid increased in the upper and lower xylem of resistant trees, and slightly increased in the upper xylem of susceptible trees. Monoterpene-enriched resin is more fluid than constitutive resin, and probably flows more readily into oviposition cavities and larval mines, where it may kill immature weevils. Loss of resin components in the lower xylem suggested catabolism and transport of these materials to the site of wounding; however, energetic and regulatory data are necessary to confirm this hypothesis. This study provides a basis for measuring the ability of a tree to undergo traumatic resinosis, which could be used to screen for resistance to white <b>pine</b> <b>weevil.</b>|$|E

Seedlings planted or arising from natural regeneration (germinated seed-fall) after clear felling operations are especially at risk. The adult weevils cause damage by eating the bark of seedlings around the 'collar' of the stem, thus 'ring-barking' the tree seedling which usually results in its demise.|$|E

40|$|Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst) {{produces}} an oleoresin {{characterized by a}} diverse array of terpenoids, monoterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, and diterpene resin acids that can protect conifers against potential herbivores and pathogens. Oleoresin accumulates constitutively in resin ducts in the cortex and phloem (bark) of Norway spruce stems. De novo formation of traumatic resin ducts (TDs) is observed in the developing secondary xylem (wood) after insect attack, fungal elicitation, and mechanical wounding. Here, we characterize the methyl jasmonate-induced formation of TDs in Norway spruce by microscopy, chemical analyses of resin composition, and assays of terpenoid biosynthetic enzymes. The response involves tissue-specific differentiation of TDs, terpenoid accumulation, and induction of enzyme activities of both prenyltransferases and terpene synthases in the developing xylem, a tissue that constitutively lacks axial resin ducts in spruce. The induction of a complex defense response in Norway spruce by methyl jasmonate application provides new avenues to evaluate the role of resin defenses for protection of conifers against destructive pests such as white <b>pine</b> <b>weevils</b> (Pissodes strobi), bark beetles (Coleoptera, Scolytidae), and insect-associated tree pathogens...|$|R
50|$|Nemonychidae is a {{small family}} of weevils, placed within the {{primitive}} weevil group because they have straight rather than elbowed antennae.

40|$|Our {{ability to}} {{document}} insect preference for semiochemicals is pivotal in pest control as these agents can improve monitoring and be deployed within {{integrated pest management}} programmes for more efficacious control of pest species. However, methods used to date have drawbacks that limit their utility. We present and test a new concept for determining insect motivation to move towards, or away from, semiochemicals by noting direction and speed of movement as animals work against a defined energy landscape (environmentally dependent variation {{in the cost of}} transport) requiring different powers to negotiate. We conducted trials with the <b>pine</b> <b>weevils</b> Hylobius abietis and peach-potato aphids Myzus persicae exposed to various attractants and repellents and placed so that they either moved up defined slopes against gravity or had to travel over variously rough surfaces. Linear Mixed Models demonstrated clear reductions in travel speed by insects moving along increasingly energetically taxing energy landscapes but also that responses varied according to different semiochemicals, thus highlighting the value of energy landscapes as a new concept to help measure insect motivation to access or avoid different attractants or repellents across individuals. New sensitive, detailed indicators of insect motivation derived from this approach should prove important in pest control across the world...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to being an efficient disperser, P. pinaster is known to produce oleoresins, such as oily terpenes or fatty acids, which can inhibit other species within the community from growing. These resins are produced as a defense mechanism against insect predators, such as the large <b>pine</b> <b>weevil.</b> According to an experiment done in Spain, the resin canal density was twice as high in the P. pinaster seedlings attacked by the weevils compared to the unattacked seedlings. Since P. pinaster {{has the ability to}} regulate their production of defense mechanisms, it can protect itself from predatory in an energy-efficient manner. The resins make the P. pinaster less vulnerable to damage from insects, but they are only produced in high concentrations when P. pinaster is under attack. In other words, P. pinaster does not waste energy producing resins in safe conditions, so the conserved energy can be used for growth or reproduction. These characteristics enhance the ability of P. pinaster survive and flourish in the areas it invades. Both the traits of P. pinaster and the habitat in South Africa are conducive to the success of P. pinaster in this region of the world.|$|E
50|$|Various {{natural enemies}} attack {{immature}} and adult pine weevils in the wild. Natural enemies include predatory beetles, insect killing fungi, microscopic insect killing worms (entomopathogenic nematodes) and a parasitic wasp, Bracon hylobii. Ground beetles, nematodes and fungi can kill both immature and adult weevils. The parasitic wasp attacks <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> larvae only.Entomopathogenic nematodes are microscopic worms that kill only insects. Nematodes {{of the families}} Steinernematidae and Heterorhabditidae are used as biological insecticides against a number of soils inhabiting insect pest. Laboratory and field {{research has demonstrated that}} the larval, pupal and adult stages of H. abietis are susceptible to these nematodes. In contrast, the parasitic wasp B. Hylobii, kills only the larval stage of H. abietis. The life cycles of entomopathogenic nematodes and B. hylobii are well adapted to their host and both are capable of locating, infecting and killing H. abietis in the concealed environment of the tree stump. (The potential for biological control to reduce hylobius abietis damage, by Julia Brixey) In 1994 was treated in Asturias (Spain), because of great attack, with Metoxicloro 1% in 20 ha affected.

The aims of the work underlying this thesis were to obtain more knowledge about the effects of selected regeneration methods (scarification, shelterwoods, and feeding barriers) that can reduce <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> damage to enable more effective counter-measures to be designed. Field experiments were performed in south central Sweden to study <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> damage amongst planted Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.) seedlings.

40|$|Grooming and {{avoidance}} of contaminated areas {{are among the}} behavioural defences employed by animals against parasites. Antiparasite defence behaviour is costly in terms of time, energy and/or food foregone and therefore animals are expected to modulate their defences depending on the risk of attack and/or {{the severity of the}} symptoms caused. We tested the hypothesis that an insect host invests more in defence against more virulent (more likely to cause death) than less virulent parasites. We tested avoidance and grooming of adult <b>pine</b> <b>weevils,</b> Hylobius abietis, in response to infective juveniles of two species of entomopathogenic nematodes, the more virulent Steinernema carpocapsae and less virulent Heterorhabditis downesi. Weevils avoided feeding on a substrate contaminated with S. carpocapsae but not H. downesi. Weevils also groomed more when their bodies were contaminated with S. carpocapsae than either H. downesi or water. We also made direct observations of nematodes on weevils. When equal numbers of nematodes were applied to weevils more S. carpocapsae than H. downesi moved actively on the weevil’s cuticle. Thus, the differential response of weevils to the two nematode species {{can be explained by the}} weevils detecting the more aggressive behaviour of S. carpocapsae than H. downesi, which corresponds to a higher probability of death...|$|R

Attack by <b>pine</b> <b>weevils</b> (Hylobius abietis) was reduced by 50 per cent by NIC treatment, 62. 5 per cent by JA treatment and 25 per cent by 5 -Aza treatment, when compared with seedlings grown from untreated seeds.

Girdling was also reduced by the different treatments. Analysis of conifer seedlings treated with 5 -Aza points at a possible involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in this defensive capacity.

Planting beneath a shelterwood has proved to reduce <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> damage on conifer seedlings, but the reasons for this are not yet fully understood.

The effect of removing shelter trees on <b>pine</b> <b>weevil</b> damage to seedlings was examined in a survey study. <b>Pine</b> <b>weevil</b> damage on seedlings was significantly reduced when extra food (fresh branches of Scots pine) was regularly provided close to the seedling.

40|$|A field {{experiment}} was established between 1989 and 1993 on four sites in southern Sweden {{to study the}} effects of the clearcut age on damage by <b>pine</b> <b>weevils</b> and competing vegetation. On each site, Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) seedlings were planted on 0 - to 4 -year-old clearcuts. In the study reported here, the effects of clearcut age, mounding, herbicide, mowing, and removal of slash on growth of ground vegetation were investigated. The study was restricted to analysis of second-year growth of planted Norway spruce seedlings, i. e., established seedlings. Ground vegetation was sparse on fresh and 1 -year-old clearcuts. On older clearcuts the dry weight of ground vegetation ranged between 1 and 4 Mg/ha, with a considerable variation between years and sites. Seedling growth was negatively influenced by ground vegetation. Mounding and herbicide treatments reduced ground vegetation and increased seedling growth, especially on older clearcuts, while mowing had no effect. Slash removal had no significant effect on the amount of ground vegetation and did not affect seedling growth. Carbon isotope analysis (13 C abundance), predawn water potential, and needle conductance did not reveal a consistent difference iri water stress between seedlings in undisturbed and vegetation-controlled plots, even during dry periods. There was no evidence that competitor effects on radiation were related to seedling growth response.

The effect of fertilisation on the resin canal structure of Pinus pinaster seedlings established in two trials in NW Spain, one attacked by Hylobius abietis {{and the other}} non-attacked, was studied. The leaders of 50 plants were destructively sampled and the resin canal density, the canal area and its relative conductive area in the phloem and xylem were assessed. Experimentally increased nutrient availability significantly decreased resin canal density in the phloem of the seedlings in the two analysed trials, where unfertilised seedlings presented up to 30 % more resin canal density than the fertilised seedlings (mean value ± SEM = 0. 32 ± 0. 02 resin canals mm− 2 in the fertilised plants versus 0. 45 ± 0. 04 resin canals mm− 2 in the control plants).
