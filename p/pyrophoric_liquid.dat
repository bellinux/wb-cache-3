50|$|Small {{amounts of}} <b>pyrophoric</b> <b>liquids</b> are often {{supplied}} {{in a glass}} bottle with a PTFE (Teflon)-lined septum. Larger amounts are supplied in metal tanks similar to gas cylinders, designed so a needle can fit through the valve opening.

25|$|A typical <b>liquid</b> <b>pyrophoric</b> fuel is triethylaluminium. Upon {{combustion}} of triethylaluminium, {{a selective}} IR spectrum is obtained, which is mainly determined from {{carbon dioxide and}} water vapour.

50|$|Triethylborane (TEB), {{also called}} triethylboron, is an organoborane (a {{compound}} with a B-C bond). It is a colorless <b>pyrophoric</b> <b>liquid.</b> Its chemical formula is (C2H5)3B, abbreviated Et3B. It is soluble in organic solvents tetrahydrofuran and hexane.|$|E
50|$|Aluminium borohydride, {{also known}} as {{aluminium}} tetrahydroborate, (in American English, aluminum borohydride and aluminum tetrahydroborate, respectively) is the chemical compound with the formula Al(BH4)3. It is a volatile <b>pyrophoric</b> <b>liquid</b> which is used as rocket fuel, and as a reducing agent in laboratories. Unlike most other metal-borohydrides, which are ionic structures, aluminium borohydride is a covalent compound.|$|E
50|$|TMG is a clear, colorless, <b>pyrophoric</b> <b>liquid.</b> Even the {{hydrocarbon}} solutions of TMG, when sufficiently saturated, {{are known}} to catch fire on exposure to air. TMG is known to react violently with water and other compounds {{that are capable of}} providing labile and active hydrogen (i.e. protons). Therefore, TMG needs to be handled with care and caution, e.g. stored in a cool, dry place at 0-25 °C, under inert atmosphere, and ensuring that storage temperatures would not exceed 40 °C to avoid deterioration.|$|E
50|$|Trimethylstibine is an organoantimony {{compound}} {{with the}} formula Sb(CH3)3. It is a colorless <b>pyrophoric</b> and toxic <b>liquid.</b> It is synthesized by treatment of antimony trichloride and methyl Grignard reagent. It {{is produced by}} anaerobic bacteria in antimony-rich soils. In contrast to trimethylphosphine, trimethylstibine is a weaker Lewis base. It {{is used in the}} production of some III-V semiconductors.|$|R
40|$|Pyrophoric {{reagents}} {{represent an}} important class of reactants {{because they can}} participate in {{many different types of}} reactions. They are very useful in organic synthesis and in industrial applications. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) define Pyrophorics as substances that will self-ignite in air at temperatures of 130 F (54. 4 C) or less. However, the U. S. Department of Transportation (DOT) uses criteria different from the auto-ignition temperature criterion. The DOT defines a pyrophoric material as a liquid or solid that, even in small quantities and without an external ignition source, can ignite within five minutes after coming in contact with air when tested according to the United Nations Manual of Tests and Criteria. The Environmental Protection Agency has adopted the DOT definition. Regardless of which definition is used, oxidation of the pyrophoric reagents by oxygen or exothermic reactions with moisture in the air (resulting in the generation of a flammable gas such as hydrogen) is so rapid that ignition occurs spontaneously. Due to the inherent nature of pyrophoric substances to ignite spontaneously upon exposure to air, special precautions must be taken to ensure their safe handling and use. Pyrophoric gases (such as diborane, dichloroborane, phosphine, etc.) are typically the easiest class of pyrophoric substances to handle since the gas can be plumbed directly to the application and used remotely. <b>Pyrophoric</b> solids and <b>liquids,</b> however, require the user to physically manipulate them when transferring them from one container to another. Failure to follow proper safety precautions could result in serious injury or unintended consequences to laboratory personnel. Because of this danger, pyrophorics should be handled only by experienced personnel. Users with limited experience must be trained on how to handle pyrophoric reagents and consult with a knowledgeable staff member prior to performing the experimental task. The {{purpose of this article is}} three fold: (1) to provide guidelines and general safety precautions to avoid accidents, (2) describe proper techniques on how to successfully handle, store, and dispose of <b>pyrophoric</b> <b>liquids</b> and solids, and (3) illustrate best practices for working with this class of reactants in a laboratory environment...|$|R
50|$|As {{with the}} {{pyrotechnic}} payloads these will also give either graybody radiation or selective emissions.In contrast to pyrotechnic payloads, pyrophoric substances use the oxygen {{from the environment}} for oxidation. Hence specific energy density of pyrophorics is always higher as compared to any pyrotechnic; however, pyrophorics suffer from low oxygen partial pressure at greater heights.A typical <b>liquid</b> <b>pyrophoric</b> fuel is triethylaluminium. Upon combustion of triethylaluminium, a selective IR spectrum is obtained, which is mainly determined from carbon dioxide and water vapour. Any transient or permanent combustion product of aluminium are not IR-active in this region of the electromagnetic spectrum.|$|R
5000|$|A {{flammable}} liquid is a liquid with a flash point of {{not more than}} 93 °C. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are {{assigned to one of}} four hazard categories {{on the basis of the}} flash point and boiling point. A <b>pyrophoric</b> <b>liquid</b> is a liquid that, even in small quantities, is liable to ignite within five minutes after coming into contact with air. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to a single hazard category on the basis of the outcome of the UN Test N.3.|$|E
40|$|Lecturepg. 109 The {{environmental}} requirements that drive chemical producers {{to move more}} and more {{to the use of the}} ?sealless? pump are described. The development of the sealless pumps in the European industrial community and their application in various chemical services is traced. More significant developments are enumerated in the areas of design and materials as applied to this complex problem. Finally, a summary of the successes and failures of the sealless pump in various services are documented. The term sealless pump applies to the canned motor pump and the magnetic drive or magnetically coupled pump. Both of these designs are discussed along with their relative merits. The sealless pump was developed specifically to totally eliminate the need for a mechanical sealing system. The mechanical seal, by its very design must, leak to survive and this feature is not acceptable in certain liquid services. The driving force behind this development was originally the handling of toxic (lethal) or <b>pyrophoric,</b> flammable <b>liquids.</b> This technology has, in recent years, found a new more formidable champion in the almost universal concern for the environment and in the governmental legislation relating to those concerns...|$|R
40|$|<b>Pyrophoric</b> {{chemicals}} are <b>liquids</b> or solids {{that have the}} potential to spontaneously ignite in air at temperatures near 130 oF (54 oC). They are extremely reactive to oxygen and moisture, so precautions must always be taken to prevent their exposure to air. These {{chemicals are}} often sold and stored in flammable solvents, such as ethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran (THF), or pentanes, exacerbating the dangers. Whenever possible, purchase chemicals that are stored in heptane, since it is less hazardous than the other solvents. There are numerous pyrophoric chemicals that are frequently used in scientific research laboratories. Below is a list of some general examples: • Grignard reagents, RMgX • Metal alkyls and aryls, such as RLi, RNa, R 3 Al, R 2 Zn • Metal carbonyls such as Ni(CO) 4, Fe(CO) 5, Co 2 (CO) 8 • Alkali metals such as Na,...|$|R
