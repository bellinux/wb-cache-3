50|$|As of June 23, 2008, 10-digit dialing became {{mandatory}} across British Columbia; {{attempting to}} use seven digits would trigger an intercept message reminding callers {{of the new}} rule. After September 12, 2008, <b>7-digit</b> <b>dialing</b> ceased to function.|$|R
50|$|Under an overlay <b>plan,</b> {{permissive}} <b>dialing</b> {{refers to}} the ability to continue to connect calls via <b>7-digit</b> <b>dialing</b> while also making 10-digit dialing valid. Again, the affected area must not introduce any new ambiguous telephone exchanges. At the end of the period, 10-digit dialing becomes mandatory.|$|R
50|$|On July 29, 2017, 10-digit dialing became {{mandatory}} for all local calls in Western Washington, replacing {{the use of}} <b>7-digit</b> <b>dialing.</b> Beginning September 30, 2017, telephone numbers with the area code 564 will be issued in the existing number plan area 360. When the other codes in western Washington exhaust, 564 numbers will also be assigned in those areas.|$|R
50|$|Area code 709 is {{expected}} to be exhausted by March 2019, at which point Newfoundland and Labrador will receive an overlay area code and 10-digit dialing will become necessary in the province. Area code 879 has been reserved as the second code {{for the purpose of this}} overlay. For now, this and the three other Canadian area codes, 506, 807 and 867 still use <b>7-digit</b> <b>dialling</b> and have yet to be overlaid.|$|R
50|$|The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) {{announced}} on June 7, 2007, that 778 {{would become an}} overlay for the entire province on July 4, 2007, after the same number allocation problem that previously afflicted 604 brought 250 close to exhaustion. Effective June 23, 2008, 10-digit dialing became mandatory in BC and a recording was played to remind callers of the new rule. After September 12, 2008, <b>7-digit</b> <b>dialing</b> was no longer functional.|$|R
50|$|After {{the area}} code reached an {{projected}} exhaust date of 2019, the California Public Utilities Commission approved a boundary elimination overlay {{plan that will}} unify the boundaries of area codes 619 and 858, similar to the boundary elimination overlay of area codes 213 and 323 in Los Angeles county. This plan will necessitate 10-digit dialing for customers in both area codes starting in April 2018; until then, San Diego is the state's largest city in which <b>7-digit</b> <b>dialling</b> is still possible.|$|R
5000|$|Depending on the {{techniques}} used for area code expansion, {{the effect on}} telephone users varies. In areas in which overlays were used, this generally avoids the need for converting telephone numbers, so existing directories, business records, letterheads, business cards, advertising, and [...] "speed-dialing" [...] settings can retain the same phone numbers, while the overlay is used for new number allocations. The primary impact on telephone users is the necessity of remembering and dialing 10- or 11-digit numbers when only <b>7-digit</b> <b>dialing</b> was previously permissible.|$|R
40|$|This report {{gives an}} {{overview}} on {{the impacts of}} closing a national <b>dialling</b> <b>plan.</b> It clarifies the differences between numbering <b>plans</b> and <b>dialling</b> <b>plans,</b> and shows that the closure of a <b>dialling</b> <b>plan</b> fosters a more efficient use of a numbering plan. The report draws the following conclusions: Closing the <b>dialling</b> <b>plan</b> facilitates more efficient use of the numbering plan as it releases additional numbers for use for operators, subscribers and services. Geographic significance in numbers is not automatically removed when closing the <b>dialling</b> <b>plan.</b> Removing the geographic significance in numbers fosters an even more efficient use of numbering capacity within a numbering <b>plan.</b> Closing the <b>dialling</b> <b>plan</b> may be a prerequisite for further possible evolution of a national numbering plan, {{but there is no}} link between a <b>dialling</b> <b>plan</b> and geographic numbering significance, i. e. a country may choose to close its <b>dialling</b> <b>plan,</b> but still keep the geographic significance of numbers. Although in many countries location portability is considered as a voluntary service aspect, closing the <b>dialling</b> <b>plan</b> and removal of geographic significance of numbers will widen the scope of location number portability to the whole country. This means that the geographic information of a number will graduall...|$|R

5000|$|A <b>dialing</b> <b>plan</b> {{establishes}} the permitted sequences of digits dialed on subscriber or station lines with subscriber premises equipment, such as telephones and {{private branch exchange}} (PBX) systems. [...] <b>Dialing</b> <b>plans</b> in the public switch telephone network (PSTN) have traditionally been more {{commonly referred to as}} dialing procedures. The <b>dialing</b> <b>plan</b> of a private telephone system or a customer premise equipment, such as an analog telephone adapter (ATA) or an IP phone, is sometimes also called <b>dial</b> <b>plan.</b> The digit sequences (numbers) permissible in a <b>dialing</b> <b>plan</b> may be as short as a single digit, e.g. for reaching an operator, or as long as a complete international telephone number, including trunk prefixes and international prefixes.|$|R
5000|$|As overlay {{plans have}} spread to more areas, 10-digit dialing in the U.S. and Canada is {{becoming}} increasingly common. However, most areas not within an overlay plan can still use <b>7-digit</b> <b>dialing</b> for local calls, although long distance calls within the area code may have required ten or eleven digits. Eleven digits for toll calls became standard in all of North America {{by the end of}} 1994 to allow introduction of [...] "interchangeable NPA codes" [...] - area codes that did not have a 0 or 1 as the middle digit and could therefore be confused with the central office code - after January 1, 1995.|$|R

50|$|Within the NANP, {{a leading}} digit of 0 or 1 {{indicates}} special dialing arrangements such as 0-1-1 {{followed by a}} country code is used to dial internationally or 1 followed by a 10-digit phone number indicating long distance or toll charges. In a few states, some areas retain {{the ability to use}} <b>7-digit</b> <b>dialing</b> for local calls; in these areas a leading digit of 1- must be followed by a 10-digit phone number. As such, N11s are restricted by NANP design to N = 2 through 9, creating the 8 allowable N11s. This is also why NPAs (Area Codes) or 7-digit phone numbers (designated by NXX-XXXX) cannot have a 0 or 1 as the first digit (N).|$|R
50|$|Gatekeepers {{have the}} ability to {{neighbor}} together so that call resolution can happen between zones. Neighboring facilitates the use of <b>dial</b> <b>plans</b> such as the Global <b>Dialing</b> Scheme. <b>Dial</b> <b>plans</b> facilitate “inter-zone” <b>dialing</b> so that two endpoints in separate zones can still communicate with each other.|$|R
50|$|Area code 867, {{the area}} code {{for the three}} Canadian territories in the Arctic far north, was created on October 21, 1997, from {{portions}} of area codes 403 and 819. It is the least populated mainland North American area code, serving only about 100,000 people, but is the geographically largest (with Alaska's area code 907 a distant second). It is adjacent to Greenland, Russia (across the North Pole) and eight provinces or states (Alaska, Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Newfoundland, Ontario, Saskatchewan and Quebec), more jurisdictions than any other area code in North America. It {{is also one of}} four Canadian area codes yet to be overlaid, the others being 506, 709, and 807 for which <b>7-digit</b> <b>dialling</b> is still used.|$|R
50|$|Despite Southern California's {{continued}} {{rapid growth}} {{and the proliferation of}} cell phones and pagers, 213 (in its standalone form) was not projected to be exhausted until 2050. As area code 323 was projected to be exhausted in 2017, the California Public Utilities Commission approved a plan that unifies the 213/323 boundary, converting them into overlay area codes for all of central Los Angeles, after July 31, 2017. This change brought 213 back to areas that had used it {{for more than half a}} century prior to 1998. Any available 213 numbers may be assigned in the 323 area and vice versa, making 10/11-digit dialing mandatory; until then, Los Angeles was the largest city in the nation where <b>7-digit</b> <b>dialing</b> is still possible.|$|R
5000|$|Area code 506 is the {{telephone}} area code in the Canadian province of New Brunswick, encompassing the entire province. The code {{was created in}} 1955, when New Brunswick and Newfoundland (including Labrador) split from the 902 area code; Newfoundland and Labrador split to its own 709 area code in early 1962. Besides 506 & 709, 807 & 867 are the other Canadian area codes to still use <b>7-digit</b> <b>dialling</b> and {{have yet to be}} overlaid.The incumbent local exchange carrier in 506 is Bell Aliant, which was produced from a merger that included NBTel. Since 2005, local telephone service through Eastlink Communications has also been available in the town of Sackville. The 506 code is expected to [...] "exhaust" [...] in 2020.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dialing</b> <b>plans</b> {{vary from}} place to place {{depending}} on whether an area has overlays (multiple area codes serving the same area) and whether the state requires toll alerting (a leading 1+ for toll calls). The NANPA web site includes <b>dialing</b> <b>plan</b> information in their information on individual area codes.|$|R

50|$|Originally, local calls {{within an}} area code {{could be placed}} by dialing NXX-XXXX, omitting the area code, known as <b>7-digit</b> <b>dialing.</b> Only calling a {{destination}} in a different area code required dialing the destination area code, known as ten-digit dialing, but due {{to the need for}} additional telephone numbers in many regions, seven digit dialing is becoming rare in the United States. With the rapid growth of telephony in the late 20th century, large metropolitan areas saw the introduction of overlay codes in the mid and late 1990s. With two or more area codes becoming available in the same vicinity, mandatory ten-digit dialing rules were instituted, requiring the area code to be dialed for all calls. The trunk code 1 remains optional for local calls in some of these areas.|$|R

5000|$|... 807 {{is one of}} {{the least}} {{populated}} area codes in Canada. It is less than 40% used, and CNAC estimates that it will not be exhausted for many decades. In the early 21st century, as 705 neared exhaustion, CNAC briefly considered [...] "erasing" [...] the 807-705 boundary and turning 807 into an overlay for all of Ontario north and west of the Golden Horseshoe. However, because of the potential for confusion, this solution was ultimately not implemented. As a result, 807 is the only area code in Ontario without an overlay, and hence the only one still with <b>7-digit</b> <b>dialling.</b> Other Canadian area codes modelling this are 506, 709 and 867. Although Northwestern Ontario should not need an additional area code for the foreseeable future, it is still possible that 10-digit dialing may be implemented in the area in the near future.|$|R
