40|$|The {{influence}} of different additives on the effective HLB values of non-ionic emulsifiers was studied by {{the method of}} {{the determination of the}} <b>phenol</b> <b>index</b> values and by the determination of the emulsion inversion point in the system with xylene as the oil phase. Ethanol, glycerol and ethylene glycol were investigated as additives. The method of the determination of the <b>phenol</b> <b>index</b> value was applied on two homologous series of non-ionic emulsifiers: nonylphenolpolyglycolethers with 10, 15, 23 and 30 moles of bound ethylene oxide and polyglycolethers of fatty alcohols (C 16 C 18) with 15, 20 and 23 moles of bound ethylene oxide. The additives were applied in the concentration of 5, 10, 15 and 20 %. The results showed that ethanol and ethylene glycol increased the <b>phenol</b> <b>index</b> value. The {{influence of}} ethanol was more pronounced. On the contrary, glycerol reduces the <b>phenol</b> <b>index</b> value. There were small differences in the influence of these additives on certain members of both homologous series, but the general trend is presented here. The influence of the same additives on the values of the emulsion inversion point was investigated in the system with xylene and nonylphenolpolyglycolethers with 10 moles of bound ethylene oxide. Ethanol and ethylene glycol were applied in the concentrations of 1, 5, 10 and 15 %, and glycerol in 5, 7. 5, 10 and 15 %. The results showed that ethanol and ethylene glycol reduce the emulsion inversion points, while glycerol increases them. On the basis of these investigations it can be concluded that ethanol and ethylene glycol could contribute to an increase in the stability of emulsions, glycerol has the opposite effect. The results of both applied methods are in accordance...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to verify the signaling/profiling potential of wine compounds and the physicochemical and bioclimatic winerelated measurements on a nationwide sensory scale of red wine typicality. Color tonality evolved from violet-purple in cooler northern regions to ruby-garnet in hotter southern regions. Acidity and astringency were enhanced from south to north. Conversely, alcohol and viscosity progressed southward. Bitterness was primarily affected by inland-coastal influence. The regional differentiation of astringency and bitterness introduced an orthogonal reading (N north- S south vs. E inland-W coastal, respectively), rather than a linear one, these findings adding novelty to sensory research. Additionally, several Portuguese-related studies were reviewed, and their findings were correlated with six sensory measures. Bioclimatic indexes, pH and the total <b>phenol</b> <b>index</b> were considered the strongest profilers in a nationwide assessment on red wine typicality. The ratio of the oligomeric/polymeric composition of tannins, as well as total anthocyanins, was also to {{be considered to be}} a valid sensory profiler.

40|$|Olive mill {{wastewater}} (OMW), {{a highly}} polluted wastewater from {{the olive oil}} industry, was treated by solar photocatalysis and solar photo-Fenton. Among the tested systems the application of titanium dioxide alone was not successful. The addition of peroxydisulphate as an electron acceptor had only limited effect on degradation performance and led to high salt concentrations (30 g/l sulphate generated) and a pH value near zero. The photo-Fenton method successfully removed up to 85 % COD and up to 100 % of <b>phenol</b> <b>index</b> of OMW with different initial concentrations and from different sources. Two solar photocatalytic pilot-plant reactors were used; one of conventional CPC type and an open non-concentrating Falling Film Reactor. The latter, newly designed reactor worked properly and yielded comparable results to the CPC in terms of degradation rate referred to incident UV radiation energy per solution volume. The suspended solids in the OMW hinder light from entering the reactor. Therefore, flocculation induced by a commercial flocculation agent was successfully applied to remove suspended solids. Application of this pre-treatment led to considerable increase of degradation rates and decrease of hydrogen peroxide consumption...|$|E

Two sets of analyses were made on 30 wine samples of 2014 vintage, after malolactic fermentation took place, to evaluate several physicochemical characteristics from these wines related to color and polyphenols. Several parameters related with color and the general phenolic composition of wines (total <b>phenols</b> <b>index,</b> color intensity, hue, total anthocyans, total anthocyanins, colored anthocyanins, chemical age index, and total tannins) were determined by UV-VIS spectrophotometry. Those analyses revealed that Alicante Bouschet wines presented, in general, a higher content of polyphenols and a more intense color than Mencia wines. Using HPLC-DAD, five anthocyanin monoglucosides and nine acylated anthocyanins were identified in both types of wine; each type of wine showed a distinctive anthocyanin fingerprint, as Alicante Bouschet wines contained a higher proportion of cyanidin-derived anthocyanins.

Xylene was used as extraction solvent in combination with a mixture of acetonitrile and n-propanol as dispersion solvents. The analytical procedure consists of mixing the sample with buffer, reacting it with 4 -aminoantipyrine and potassium hexacyanoferrate, DLLME, phase separation, and index quantification and was automated using the multisyringe flow injection analysis technique and takes 200 s only. DLLME was accomplished by aspiration of the mixture of extraction and dispersion solvents followed by the aqueous phases into the syringe at a high flow rate. Phase separation occurs due to aggregation of the floating extractant droplets (with their lower specific density) {{at the head of the}} syringe. The extractant containing the chromogenic reaction product is then pushed into an optical waveguide capillary cell and spectrophotometrically detected at 500 nm.

About one-third of the used geothermal water has been reinjected since 1998 by two reinjection wells at the end of the thermal loops. During the operation, plugging of the surface system was experienced within a few-day-long period, due to biological processes. The goal of our research was to find the dominant species of the microbial flora and to make a proposal to avoid further bacterial problems.

40|$|New {{priorities}} for the environment {{have resulted in a}} reassessment of modern technology for treatment of urban wastewater. Urban wastewater treatment mainly involves the elimination or reduction of anthropogenic organic micropollutants in the aquatic environment. In this paper, the effectiveness of bisphenol A elimination from waste-water, after biological treatment, through a complex ultrafiltration/reverse osmosis purification process was evaluated. The effectveness of the wastewater treatment process in the tested system was also evaluated with a number of other physical and chemical analyses for pH, turbidity, colour, absorbance, TOC, <b>phenol</b> <b>index,</b> conductivity and the concentration of selected heavy metals. Within this study, the change in the hydraulic performance of the membranes was also investigated. The effectiveness of the reduction of bisphenol A concentrations during the process of ultrafiltration was small, due to the significant difference between the size of the pores of the membrane and the size of eliminated micropollutants. In the process of reverse osmosis, the wastewater treatment system reported that the concentration of bisphenol A was reduced by 68 %. In the tested treatment system, the ultrafiltration/reverse osmosis completely removed colour, lead and chromium. Other contaminants were eliminated by more than 31 %. In both membrane processes, there was evidence that the membrane pores were blocked, but this occurred to a greater extent during the process of reverse osmosis...|$|E

The evaluation of mechanically performed early defoliation and crop thinning, aiming at {{yield management}}, and their effects on the vegetative growth, yield components, grape and wine composition, against a non-defoliated, not-thinned control, and manual treatments are presented. Manual and mechanical early defoliation and crop thinning were conducted at pre-bloom and veraison, respectively, on ‘Tempranillo’ (Vitis vinifera L.) VSP grapevines in season 2009. A detailed description of the mechanical settings and adjustments, based on preliminary results from previous seasons, for the correct performance of both techniques is provided. Whilst total leaf area remained unaltered, yield was drastically reduced by both practices (38 - 40 %), hence the leaf-to-fruit ratio also enhanced with respect to control vines. Cluster weight, berry number, as well as cluster compactness and Botrytis incidence were also reduced in yield regulated vines, but berry weight tended to increase in mechanically thinned vines and remained unaffected in the early defoliated plants.

This approach provides experimental set-ups of increased robustness and reliability, which simplify their application to in-line and continuous biomedical and environmental monitoring. In this work, a novel, compact and autonomous microanalyzer aimed at multiwavelength colorimetric determinations is presented. It integrates the microfluidics (a three-dimensional mixer and a 25 mm length "Z-shape" optical flow-cell), a highly versatile multiwavelength optical detection system and the associated electronics for signal processing and drive, {{all in the same}} device. The flexibility provided by its design allows the microanalyzer to be operated either in single fixed mode to provide a dedicated photometer or in multiple wavelength mode to obtain discrete pseudospectra. To increase its reliability, automate its operation and allow it to work under unattended conditions, a multicommutation sub-system was developed and integrated with the experimental set-up. The device was initially evaluated in the absence of chemical reactions using four acidochromic dyes and later applied to determine some key environmental parameters such as <b>phenol</b> <b>index,</b> chromium(VI) and nitrite ions.

The composition of particulate lignin phenols exhibited clear annual and periodic variations but only minor seasonal changes. Lignin phenol ratios (vanillyl/syringyl and cinnamyl/vanillyl) indicated that the terrigenous organic matter (OM) was primarily composed of woody and nonwoody tissue derived from angiosperm plants. The low-lignin phenol yields (Λ 8) in combination with higher acid to aldehyde ratios reflected a substantial contribution fromsoil OM to the particle samples or modifications during river transport. The temporal shift of the lignin <b>phenol</b> vegetation <b>index</b> with the sediment load during the flood seasons revealed particulate organic matter (POM) erosion from soils {{and the impact of}} hydrodynamic processes. The dam operations affected the seasonal variability of terrigenous OM fluxes, although the covariation of lignin and sediment loads with discharged water implies that unseasonal extreme conditions and climate changemost likely had larger influences, because decreases in the sediment load and lignin flux alter the structure and composition of particulate OM (POM) on interannual time scales, indicating that they may be driven by climate variability.

In order to compare the sorptive affinity of the alumina surface for the <b>phenols</b> an <b>index</b> of sorption has been defined as "the number of moles of phenol sorbed at constant relative mole fraction of phenol in the mobile phase", and it has been demonstrated that this index can be related logarithmically to the Hammett sigma constant for the appropriate 4 -substituent. The effects of 4 -substitution on properties of the OH bond which reflect its hydrogen bonding tendency have been examined, such as association to dioxan in solution. Absorbance measurements in the near ultra-violet have enabled association constants in solution for the process substituted phenol + dioxin ↔ complex to be determined at 25 C. and 55 C. Comparisons have been made with other relevant characteristics of the OH bond, for example acidity, polarity and near infra red stretching frequency, again showing (as with the hydrogen bonding association constants) good correlation with the Hammett structural parameter. The results obtained suggest that in the sorption of 4 -substituted phenols from dioxan solution onto an activated alumina the forces on the surface are the dominant ones, since the phenols are not adsorbed as complexes but as discreet molecules. Interaction with the surface appears to be through the mechanism of hydrogen bonding and the phenol molecules probably assume a vertical orientation on localised sorption sites...|$|R

It consists of three Pt wires piercing through a Teflon rod, whose exposed end is coated with an adhesive film of ionic liquid which assured the necessary ionic conductivity between the electrodes while displaying concomitantly good solvent properties. The electrode assembly was exposed to the headspace in equilibrium with wastewater samples for controlled times, until a convenient preconcentration of volatile phenols was achieved. At the end of this step, voltammetric detection was directly performed in situ. The performance of this device was assayed in both phenol synthetic samples and in real wastewaters, after that the preconcentration step was optimized with regard to the effect of pH of the sample, preconcentration time sample and probe temperature and nature of IL. Voltammetric responses characterized by good repeatability (+/- 4 %) were recorded, whose height and area depended linearly on the phenol concentration over a wide range (ca. 3 orders of magnitude). The detection limit, estimated for a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 (2 mu M at 20 degrees C and 0. 2 mu M at 80 degrees C), was lower than the limit set by the European Community for phenols in wastewaters (ca. 5 mu M).

[Methods and results] Grape anthocyanin and phenol measurements were conducted with a hand-held, non-destructive fluorescence-based proximal sensor, in the vineyard (on clusters hanging on the vine) and at the winery (on harvested clusters in boxes) in two seasons. The anthocyanin fluorescence indices, ANTHRG and FERARI, were found to significantly correlate with the wine color density (R 2 ranged from 0. 51 to 0. 82) and total <b>phenol</b> <b>index</b> (R 2 ranged from 0. 44 to 0. 87), regardless that the measurements were made in the vineyard or in the winery.

Characterisation of the alumina surface has been attempted by x-ray diffraction photography, electron microscopy, low temperature nitrogen adsorption and dehydration experiments. The presence of pores in the alumina sample has been confirmed and a pore size distribution analysis carried out. Consideration of the porosity and surface area values obtained {{by the use of}} gas adsorption and solution adsorption methods, has enabled the area of the alumina surface available to the adsorptives to be assessed. The molecular area requirements of the adsorptives on the alumina surface have been determined from the adsorption isotherms and indicate that the phenols are perpendicularly orientated to the adsorbent surface. From the nature of the alumina surface and the orientation of the adsorptives, a probable mechanism of adsorption has been suggested. An assessment of the influence of the solvent on the adsorptive capacity of the alumina surface for the phenols has been made resolving the composite adsorption isotherms into the individual isotherms using experimentally determined monolayer values for the adsorptives from vapour and solution phase measurements.

The antioxidant activity and the total <b>phenol</b> <b>index</b> of wood extracts were also evaluated. Results confirmed differences in bacteria and yeast susceptibility to oenological wood extracts among different genera and species. Among them, AAB were especially sensitive to the phenolic inactivation from oenological woods extracts. Contrarily, amongst LAB, L. hilgardii CIAL- 49 was the most resistant strain to the action of the wood extracts. Cherry wood was active against 9 of the 11 strains tested meanwhile French, Rumanian oak wood and chestnut show the lowest values of IC 50 for A. aceti CIAL- 106. No significant correlation was found between antimicrobial activity either with antioxidant activity or with the total phenol content, suggesting that structure-function of the phenolic extracts has a greater influence on the antimicrobial activity than the total phenol content.

40|$|International audiencen February 2007, new {{approaches}} of management were {{proposed by the}} French Ministery for Sustainable Development to the various actors involved in “(potentially) contaminated land management”. They describe the stages of management of a (potentially) contaminated site: the diagnosis identifies and locates pollution, the management plan sets objectives of rehabilitation, the residual risks assessment verifies {{the accuracy of the}} selected management option, the Media Quality Assessment (MQA) (Interpretation de l'Etat des Milieux, IEM) verifies the impacts out of the site. During these approaches, the interpretation of the data collected from the field necessarily causes the comparison of the analyses and measurements with reference values. Thus, the approach of MQA is based on the risk management policy conducted by the public authorities for the French population. It results in comparing the state of the investigated mediums with:• Natural environment close to the zone of investigation;• Regulatory management values set by the public authorities. Indeed, the public authorities fix sanitary values which regulate air quality as well as water and food. Therefore, these values naturally serve as references. However, the soil is not the object of a specific regulation and no regulatory reference value exists in France for this medium. A soil is considered free from pollution since its characteristics are coherent with the local natural geochemical background. This is why, the approach results in comparing the state of the investigated soil with the state of the natural soils close to the zone of investigation. With this intention, the knowledge of the natural geochemical background, in particular of the local geochemical anomalies, is essential. Moreover, the characterization of pollution is important to distinguish if it implies the site or not. However, the industrial sites are more often gathered in industrial and urban areas where an anthropic geochemical background is superimposed to the natural geochemical background. It then becomes necessary to compare data collected on the investigated site with this anthropized pedological and geochemical background. In order to support the various actors implied in the management of (potentially) contaminated land, it was thus proposed to carry out a database of analyses of soils from urban and industrialized environment on the whole French territory. The project “Diagnoses of the soils in the places hosting children or teenagers” implemented by the French ministry for Sustainable development, was the occasion of launching an operation of sampling and analyses of urban soils {{at the level of the}} national territory. The collection of analyses during this operation constitutes the heart of the project “Geochemical Database on Urban Soils and Subsoils (BDSolU) conducted by BRGM and funded by ADEME.

40|$|Problem statement: The {{composition}} of wastes is quite variable depending upon the&# 13; generating source and mode of collection. Most {{of the material}} from the domestic activities will be&# 13; organic in nature and contains essential plant nutrients, whereas the dumping material of commercial&# 13; and industrial wastes usually contains appreciable amounts of heavy and potentially toxic metals and&# 13; organic pollutants. Approach: Objective {{of the present study}} was to characterize the physico-chemical&# 13; properties of the waste material and the distribution and extent of toxic pollutants in three selected&# 13; typical dumping sites in the state of Haryana, India. Results: 62 - 65 % of the waste fine material&# 13; consisted of mineral particles and biodegradable organic waste, 20 - 25 % consisted of construction and&# 13; demolition waste and the remaining 10 - 15 % were other materials such as study, plastic, metals, glass&# 13; and timber, with an amount of polyethene of 3. 4 - 5. 7 %. The ratio of the plant available concentrations&# 13; of P, K and S and their total amounts were 3 - 7 % for P and 1 - 4 % for S, whereas the macronutrient&# 13; potassium reached values of 29 - 39 %. Metals As, Ba, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn were present in all&# 13; samples (total concentration in aqua regia extract). As, Ba, Ni and Pb did not show clear differences&# 13; between the three investigates sites. Cd, Cr and Zn concentrations were high but different at the&# 13; different sites (Cu maximum: 1, 964 mg kg &# 8722; 1, Zn maximum: 2, 200 mg kg &# 8722; 1). The mobility of the metals&# 13; was calculated as the ratio of DTPA/aqua regia extraction. Cd showed the highest ratio (18 - 22 %),&# 13; while the other calculated metals showed much lower ratios (Cu 6. 7, Pb 7. 9 Ni 2. 1, Zn 3. 6 and Cr&# 13; 0. 5 %). In general, PAH and benzo(a) pyrene concentrations fell below the detection limit. Also the&# 13; <b>phenol</b> <b>index</b> did not exceed the detection limit of 1. 2 mg kg &# 8722; 1 (with two exceptions). In 14 out of 36 &# 13; samples a GC-MS screening was conducted in order to get an overview of the organic pollutants&# 13; usually present in the dumpsites. In all cases there was no relevant amount of organic pollutants that&# 13; would be capable of measurement. Conclusion: The dumping sites are plant nutrient deposits,&# 13; particularly for K, which could be used in future in a line with ideas of urban mining. The use of the&# 13; waste material for fertilizing purposes may be restricted due to the metal contaminant concentrations. &# 13; The analyzed organic pollutants did not indicate problematical concentrations...|$|E
40|$|Lignin phenols were {{measured}} in the sediments of Sepitiba Bay, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and in bedload sediments and suspended sediments {{of the four major}} fluvial inputs to the bay: Sao Francisco and Guandu Channels and the Guarda and Cacao Rivers. Fluvial suspended lignin yields (Sigma 8 3. 5 - 14. 6 mgC 10 g dw(- 1)) vary little between the wet and dry seasons and are poorly correlated with fluvial chlorophyll concentrations (0. 8 - 50. 2 mu gC L(- 1)). Despite current land use practices that favor grassland agriculture or industrial uses, fluvial lignin compositions are dominated by a degraded leaf-sourced material. The exception is the Guarda River, which has a slight influence from grasses. The Lignin <b>Phenol</b> Vegetation <b>Index,</b> coupled with acid/aldehyde and 3. 5 Db/V ratios, indicate that degraded leaf-derived phenols are also the primary preserved lignin component in the bay. The presence of fringe Typha sp. and Spartina sp. grass beds surrounding portions of the Bay are not reflected in the lignin signature. Instead, lignin entering the bay appears to reflect the erosion of soils containing a degraded signature from the former Atlantic rain forest that once dominated the watershed, instead of containing a significant signature derived from current agricultural uses. A three-component mixing model using the LPVI, atomic N:C ratios, and stable carbon isotopes (which range between - 26. 8 and - 21. 8 parts per thousand) supports the hypothesis that fluvial inputs to the bay are dominated by planktonic matter (78 % of the input), with lignin dominated by leaf (14 % of the input) over grass (6 %). Sediments are composed of a roughly 50 - 50 mixture of autochthonous material and terrigenous material, with lignin being primarily sourced from leaf. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The ecological features most accurately reflected by the methoxyphenolic patterns consisted of: (i) the expected lack of syringol derivatives in HAs formed in soils under Gymnosperm plants, (ii) the diagnostic patterns of guaiacols in the HAs from soils under different species of Angiosperms (Quercus spp., Fraxinus, Castanea, grasses); (iii) the responsivity of the methoxyphenols to the extent of some types of soil perturbations: the highest environmental impact on the HA structure was found in soil after severe burning, not in the soil affected by medium-intensity fire.

40|$|Effects of {{elevated}} CO 2, {{temperature and}} water availability on Apera spica-venti plants {{were examined in}} growth chambers of controlled environment. Plants at the III – IV organogenesis stage were grown in normal (~ 40 %) or drought (< 10 %) substrate and treated with investigated factor combinations: day/night temperature 21 / 14 °C x CO 2 – 350 ppm; 30 / 23 °C x CO 2 – 350 ppm; 21 / 14 °C x CO 2 – 700 ppm; 30 / 23 °C x CO 2 – 700 ppm. After 10 days treatment, leaf area, dry biomass, and the contents of photosynthetic pigments, total phenolic compounds, non-structural carbohydrates and DPPH free-radical scavenging capacity were determined. Growth and physiological traits of A. spica-venti differed in their responses to examined environmental factors and their combinations. Under ambient or elevated CO 2 and temperature conditions, substrate moisture shortage resulted in significantly lower dry biomass and leaf area of plants. Influence of investigated factors on chlorophyll a and b content was insignificant, while content of carotenoids was significantly affected by CO 2 and temperature interaction (CO 2 x T). Total non-structural carbohydrate content in A. spica-venti plants varied according to applied investigated environment factors and their interaction. Independent on temperature, moisture deficiency caused an increment of phenolic compounds at ambient CO 2.

40|$|One of the plant’s most {{important}} secondary metabolite is the Rosmarinic Acid (RA), which mainly acts as antioxidant, but also possess promising biological activities as improve the cognitive performance, prevent {{the development of}} Alzheimer’s disease, cardio-protective effects and reduce the severity of kidney diseases and cancer chemoprevention. RA {{is one of the}} first secondary metabolites produced in plant cell cultures in extremely high yields. Several studies demonstrate that RA production has been higher in in vitro systems than in natural conditions. Indeed factors like phytohormones and/or the presence of precursors from biosynthetic pathway affect secondary metabolites accumulation; nevertheless, elicitation is the most effective process to enhance the synthesis. Basil (Ocimum basilicum L.,), is a multi-functional annual herb with aromatic, antiviral, antioxidant and antibacterial properties. Basil is also a source of phenolic compounds, in particular RA. Into the basil cultivars, Genovese basil (GEN) is one of the most popular cultivar for culinary, while Dark opal basil (DO) is grown as much for its decorative appeal as for its culinary value. The present study analyzed the increase of RA production in two cultivars of O. basilicum (GEN and DO) that were elicitated with Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) at different concentration. Tests were run both in vitro and in vivo systems in order to compare the behavior of the green and red basil in the production of the secondary metabolites. For the in vitro culture was tested: traditional (Magenta vessels), cellular (callus tissue) and industrial (RITA® bioreactor) micropropagation. Also was tested a combination between in vivo-in vitro culture (Falcon tubes) and an in vivo culture (greenhouse). In the experiment was used 0. 05, 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 5 and 1 mM of MeJA to induce the elicitation. The elicitor was sprayed on shoots leaves cultivated in semisolid or solid culture medium and directly added to the liquid culture medium. Sampling was made at 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours after elicitation. The treatments were compared using the two-way ANOVA test. Using <b>phenol</b> <b>index</b> as a quick screening, was found significant difference (P< 0. 05) in the production of phenolic acid content after elicitation. In the comparison among systems and cultivars, the best result was achieved with GEN cultured in RITA® bioreactor, after 48 h of elicitation with 0. 1 mM of MeJA. The analysis of RA by HPLC revealed an increase of 2. 18 -fold over the respective control, and 9. 91 -fold in comparison with greenhouse control-plants. On the other hand, the study of the relationship between the in vitro environment and the production of RA showed different results. Stress markers such as proline and carotenoids, showed a content increase, while photosynthetic activity decreased in RITA® bioreactor, due to the hyperhydric state of shoots. About chlorophyll, the content in RITA® bioreactor of chlorophyllb increased as an effort to delays the senescence, but could also be a response to light intensity due to the color of containers. In Abscisic acid (ABA) content, the results showed an increase in all in vitro systems compared with the combined system (Falcon-tubes). The high production of ABA could be attributed to the use of 6 -benzylaminopurine in in vitro culture medium, as a response to protect the cells against the cytokinin-induced death...|$|E

The array combined oxidases and dehydrogenases immobilized on a lipidic layer prepared using the Langmuir-Blodgett technique where Glucose oxidase, D-Fructose dehydrogenase, Tyrosinase or Laccase were imbibed. A phthalocyanine was co-immobilized in the sensing layer {{and used as}} electron mediator. The array thus formed {{has been used to}} analyze grapes and provides global information about the samples while providing specific information about their phenolic and their sugar content. Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) the array of voltammetric biosensors has been successfully used to discriminate musts prepared from different varieties of grapes (Tempranillo, Garnacha, Cabernet-Sauvignon, Prieto Picudo and Mencía). Differences could be also detected between grapes of the same variety and cultivar harvested in two successive vintages (2012 and 2013). Moreover, the ripening of grapes could be monitored from veraison to maturity due to the changes in their phenolic and sugar content. Using Partial Least Squares (PLS- 1) analysis, excellent correlations have been found between the responses provided by the array of biosensors and classical parameters directly related to <b>phenols</b> (total polyphenol <b>index,</b> TPI) and sugar concentration (degree Brix) measured by chemical methods with correlation coefficients close to 1 and errors close to 0. It is also worthy to notice the good correlations found with parameters associated with the pH and acidity that can be explained by taking into account the influence of the pH in the oxidation potentials of the phenols and in the enzymatic activity. This bioelectronic tongue can assess simultaneously the sugar and the phenolic content of grapes and could be used to monitor the maturity of the fruit and could be adapted easily to field analysis. 2036 - 01 - 012036 - 01 - 01 Ministerio de Economía, Industria y Competitividad – FEDER (Grant CICYT AGL 2012 - 33535) Junta de Castilla y León (programa de apoyo a proyectos de investigación - Ref.

40|$|Peatlands {{represent}} massive global C {{pools and}} sinks. Carbon accumulation {{depends on the}} ratio between net primary production and decomposition, both of which can change under projected increases of atmospheric CO 2 and N deposition. The decomposition of litter is influenced by 1) {{the quality of the}} litter, and 2) the microenvironmental conditions in which the litter decomposes. This study aims at experimentally testing the effects of these two drivers in the context of global change. We studied the in situ litter decomposition from three common peatland species (Eriophorum vaginatum, Polytrichum strictum and Sphagnum fallax) collected after one year of litter production under pre-treatment conditions (elevated CO 2 : 560 ppm or enhanced N: 3 g m − 2 y − 1 NH 4 NO 3) and decomposed the following year under treatment conditions (same as pre-treatment). By considering the cross-effects between pre-treatments and treatments, we distinguished between the effects on mass loss of 1) the pre-treatment-induced litter quality and 2) the treatment conditions under which the litters were decomposing. The combination between CO 2 pre-treatment and CO 2 treatment reduced Polytrichum decomposition by − 24 % and this can be explained by litter quality-driven decomposition changes brought by the pre-treatment. CO 2 pre-treatment reduced Eriophorum litter quality, although this was not sufficient to predict decomposition. The N addition pre-treatment reduced the decomposition of Eriophorum, due to enhanced lignin and soluble phenols concentrations in the initial litter, and reduced litter-driven losses of starch and enhanced litter-driven losses of soluble <b>phenols.</b> While decomposition <b>indices</b> based on initial litter quality provide a broad explanation of quantitative and qualitative decomposition, they can only be taken as first approximations. Indeed, the microbial ATP activity, the litter N loss and resulting litter quality, were strongly altered irrespective of the compounds' initial concentration and by means of processes that occurred independently of the initial litter-qualitative changes. The experimental design was valuable to assess litter- and ecosystem-driven decomposition pathways simultaneously or independently. The ability to separate these two drivers makes it possible to attest the presence of litter-qualitative changes even without any litter biochemical determinations, and shows the screening potential of this approach for future experiments dealing with multiple plant species...|$|R
