Seals out moisture at pressures ranging from 50 micrometers of mercury to 200 {{pounds per square}} inch. Designed to seal throat of 38 Reaction Control Thrusters on Space Shuttle protecting internal components from corrosion. Plug conforms to contour of nozzle throat, where O-ring forms pressure seal. After plug inserted, cover attached by use of cover-fitting assembly. Modified versions useful in protecting engines, pumps, reaction vessels, and other industrial equipment during shipment and maintenance...|$|E
40|$|A CaO-Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }-SiO{sub 2 } (CAS) /Nicalon {{glass-ceramic}} {{matrix composite}} {{has been subjected}} to elevated temperature oxidation heat-treatments between 375 and 1200 {degrees}C, for up to 100 hours. Micro- and macro-mechanical properties have been determined by fiber push-down, using a mechanical properties microprobe, and flexure testing, respectively. Aging between 450 and 800 {degrees}C results in significant property degradation, with reduced bending modulus and flexure strength, increased fiber sliding stress, and a transition to a purely brittle failure mode. Aging degradation is due to oxidative removal of the carbon interlayer, with the subsequent formation of a silica bond between fiber and matrix. At higher temperatures, carbon is retained due to the formation of a <b>protective</b> silica <b>plug</b> at exposed fiber ends, with the subsequent retention of composite properties. Short duration pre-treatment schedules, at 1000 or 1100 {degrees}C, were developed to prevent intermediate temperature property degradation...|$|R
40|$|Background: Ascending {{infection}} {{from the}} colonized vagina to the normally sterile intrauterine cavity is a well-documented cause of preterm birth. The primary physical barrier to microbial ascension is the cervical canal, which {{is filled with}} a dense and <b>protective</b> mucus <b>plug.</b> Despite its central role in separating the vaginal from the intrauterine tract, the barrier properties of cervical mucus have not been studied in preterm birth. Methods and Findings: To study the protective function of the cervical mucus in preterm birth we performed a pilot case-control study to measure the viscoelasticity and permeability properties of mucus obtained from pregnant women at high-risk and low-risk for preterm birth. Using extensional and shear rheology we found that cervical mucus from women at high-risk for preterm birth was more extensible and forms significantly weaker gels compared to cervical mucus from women at low-risk of preterm birth. Moreover, permeability measurements using fluorescent microbeads show that high-risk mucus was more permeable compared with low-risk mucus. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that critical biophysical barrier properties of cervical mucus in women at high-risk for preterm birth are compromised compared to women with healthy pregnancy. We hypothesize that impaired barrier properties of cervical mucus could contribute to increased rates of intrauterine infection seen in women with preterm birth. We furthermore suggest that a robust association of spinnbarkeit and preterm birth could be an effectively exploite...|$|R
