2500|$|The Conclave {{opened on}} 1 October 1523, with thirty-five {{cardinals}} in attendance. [...] Four more cardinals joined {{them over the}} following weeks. [...] Six cardinals were unable to attend. One analysis of the <b>participants</b> <b>indicated</b> that the French faction numbered 13, the Imperial faction 4, the Medici faction 16, and six Neutral cardinals. [...] The French and Imperialists were in jealous competition with one another. Francis I expressed his approval of Cardinal Fieschi (Genoa), or Cardinal Soderini (Volterra), or Cardinal Trivulzi (Como)—all supporters of French ambitions in northern Italy and Naples. [...] The Emperor Charles expressed his approval of Cardinal Colonna, who was a personal friend, and then of Cardinal de' Medici. There were also several cardinals who had received support at the Conclave of 1521-1522 who might have harbored ambitions of their own under the right circumstances; they were Cardinals Orsini, Pucci and Giacobazzi. [...] It was immediately apparent that the French had the votes to exclude any Imperial candidate, and the Imperial faction likewise. [...] If the Imperial and Medici factions joined, however, {{they had a good}} chance of making a pope, but they needed six votes from elsewhere to realize their goal. The major stumbling block to the plan was the hostility between Cardinal Colonna and Cardinal de' Medici. [...] There was also a division among the cardinals between 'the Elders' and the 'Younger Cardinals' (those created by Leo X de' Medici); the Elders were most reluctant to support Cardinal Giulio de' Medici.|$|E

Contrary to previous research demonstrating heightened adolescent egocentrism, adolescents exhibited similar levels of egocentrism to adults. In experiment 1, 13 - 14 year-olds and adult participants both truthfully described and lied about a series of pictures. Both adolescent and adult liars {{indicated that they were}} more confident that other participants would know when they were lying, than other <b>participants</b> actually <b>indicated.</b> In experiment 2, 13 - 14 year-olds, 15 - 16 year-olds and adult participants read to an audience.

As such, ACE inhibitors should be the drug treatment of choice for patients with chronic kidney disease regardless of race or diabetic status.|$|E
50|$|Interactions between {{levels of}} {{knowledge}} and segmentation in multimedia learning: Segmentation is a strategy used to manage cognitive load, particularly with multimedia learning. By creating breaks in the instructional material (for example, dividing animations into several videos), segmentation reduces cognitive load by giving the learner time to process and reflect on the information. In addition, segments indicate what information is important by chunking information. Research conducted by Spanjers et al. (2011) suggests an expertise reversal effect when using segmentation in animations. While low knowledge learners benefited from learning from animated material that was segmented, high-knowledge learners did not. While {{there was no difference}} in performance in this study, <b>participants</b> <b>indicated</b> a difference in mental effort and efficiency between low knowledge learners and high prior knowledge learners. The authors recommend that segmentation of animation be used for low prior knowledge learners, and using continuous animation for high prior knowledge learners.|$|E
5000|$|Although beta {{blockers}} lower blood pressure, {{they do not}} have a positive benefit on endpoints as some other antihypertensives. In particular, beta-blockers are no longer recommended as first-line treatment due to relative adverse risk of stroke and new-onset of type 2 diabetes when compared to other medications, while certain specific beta-blockers such as atenolol appear to be less useful in overall treatment of hypertension than several other agents. A systematic review of 63 trials with over 35,000 <b>participants</b> <b>indicated</b> β-blockers increased the risk of mortality, compared to other antihypertensive therapies. They do, however, have an important role in the prevention of heart attacks in people who have already had a heart attack. In the United Kingdom, the June 2006 [...] "Hypertension: Management of Hypertension in Adults in Primary Care" [...] guideline of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, downgraded the role of beta-blockers due to their risk of provoking type 2 diabetes.|$|E

50|$|For some individuals, the synesthesia is only {{triggered}} by speech sounds, while others' synesthesia can be {{triggered by}} all known auditory stimuli. In a study investigating variability within categories of synesthesia, 40% of subjects with synesthesia for spoken words reported that voice pitch, accent, and prosody influenced the synesthetic concurrent, whereas few subjects reported that volume or speed of talking had any influence. Within these subjects, many reported that the speaker's emotional inflection could influence the synesthetic color, but only two reported that their own mood had such influence. Of participants categorized as having synesthesia for music in this study, 75% reported concurrents exclusively when listening to notes being played. When asked whether {{the experience of the}} concurrent could be voluntarially controlled, only 33% of <b>participants</b> <b>indicated</b> an ability to smother, ignore, or willfully evoke their concurrents without great effort. Attention to the inducing stimulus was reported as influential in 59% of participants.

5000|$|... fMRI and EEG {{scans of}} {{participants}} completing RAT's demonstrated unique brain activity corresponding to problems solved by insight. [...] For one, there is high EEG {{activity in the}} alpha- and gamma-band about 300 milliseconds before <b>participants</b> <b>indicated</b> a solution to insight problems, but not to non-insight problems. [...] Additionally, problems solved by insight corresponded to increased activity in the temporal lobes and mid-frontal cortex, while more activity in the posterior cortex corresponded to non-insight problems. [...] The data suggests there is something different occurring in the brain when solving insight versus non-insight problems that happens right before the solving of the problem. This conclusion has been supported also by eye traking data which shows an increased eye blink duration and frequency when people solve problems via Insight. This latter result, paired with an eye pattern oriented to look away from sources of visual inputs ( [...] such as looking at blank wall, or {{out the window at}} the sky [...] )proves different attention involvement in Insight problem solving vs problem solving via anlaysis.|$|E
50|$|In another study, {{researchers}} {{aimed to}} identify the contradictions that were perceived by stepchildren when characterizing the ways that familial interactions caused them to feel {{caught in the middle}} between parents. The participants expressed that they wanted to be centered in the family while, at the same time, they hoped to avoid being {{caught in the middle of}} two opposing parents. The main contradiction identified in the study was similar to the autonomy-connection dialectic; stepchildren desired the freedom to communicate and enact the desired relationship with their parents. However, these stepchildren also felt the need to manage the constraints that resulted from parental communication, particularly when both parents did not cooperate with one another. While the stepchildren wanted to know what was happening, at the same time, they also wanted to be protected, resulting in a second dialectic of control-restraint. <b>Participants</b> <b>indicated</b> that in order to put the child's needs first, both parents would need to be mature and open in their communication with one another. Through this study, the researchers believe that openness-closeness dialectic between parents and their children is important to building functional stepfamily relationships.|$|E

5000|$|Burger's {{first study}} had results {{similar to the}} ones found in Milgram's {{previous}} study. The rates of obedience were very similar to those found in the Milgram study, showing that participants' tendency to obey has not declined over time. Additionally, Burger found that both genders exhibited similar behavior, suggesting that obedience will occur in participants independent of gender.In Burger's follow-up study, he found that participants that worried about the well being of the learner were more hesitant to continue the study. He also found that the more the experimenter prodded the participant to continue, the more likely they were to stop the experiment.The Utrecht University study also replicated Milgram's results. They found that although <b>participants</b> <b>indicated</b> they did not enjoy the task, over 90% of them completed the experiment.The Bocchiaro and Zimbardo study had similar levels of obedience compared to the Milgram and Utrecht studies. They also found that participants would either stop the experiment {{at the first sign of}} the learner's pleas or would continue until the end of the experiment (called [...] "the foot in the door scenario").In addition to the above studies, additional research using participants from different cultures (including Spain, Australia, and Jordan) also found participants to be obedient.|$|E
5000|$|True's {{research}} {{focus is}} on different minority {{groups such as the}} Asian American, Japanese American, and other South East Asian communities that exist within the United States. Her research includes examining privacy and confidentiality as it relates to psychotherapy. Among the focuses of the study were the procedures in place that govern how informed consent is obtained and the federal requirements for guarding confidentiality. The study also looked at third-party insurance, specifically Medicaid, and how insurance records are kept and whether or not those records are more vulnerable than other institutions with access to confidential information. The study found weak points in the safety of patient confidential information and made recommendations for professional conduct regarding confidentiality as it relates to psychotherapy as a result. [...] True also contributed to an interview sample survey of adult residents of San Fransisco's China Town. The researchers studied Chinese Americans' use of mental health services and discovered that although the prevalence of mental health disorders in China Town was high, only 5% of <b>participants</b> <b>indicated</b> they had utilized any mental health services. The study found that this phenomenon was not caused by negative stereotypes surrounding mental illness, but rather, Chinese Americans' unawareness of the services available.|$|E

Four days (two class periods) later, participants provided their perceptions of each of the other three members of their group. Each member of the four-person team, then, was evaluated by three teammates. Thus, given that there were 171 participants in the study, there were a total of 513 (171 X 3) student-student dyads. All of this information was collected beforestudents received their grade on the project." [...] Results revealed that high self-monitors were better able to use ingratiation, self-promotion, and exemplification to achieve favorable images amont their colleagues successfully than their low self-monitor peers. “Specifically, when high self-monitors used these tactics, they were more likely to be seen as likeable, competent, and dedicated by the other members of their work groups. In contrast, low self-monitors appear to be less effective at using these tactics to obtain favorable images. In fact, the more low self-monitors used such tactics, the more likely they were to be seen as a sycophant, to be perceived as conceited, or to be perceived as egotistical by their work group colleagues.” High self-monitors are better able to use impression management tactics, such as ingratiation, than low self-monitors.|$|E

50|$|Despite finding {{evidence}} of a group-reference effect, Johnson and colleagues pointed out that people identify with numerous groups, each with unique characteristics. Therefore, {{in order to reach}} conclusive {{evidence of}} a group-reference effect, alternative group targets need to be considered. In a second experiment by Johnson et al., the group of reference was modified to be the family of the individual. This group has fewer exemplars than the pool of university students, and affective considerations of the family as a group should be strong. No specific instructions or definitions were provided for family, allowing individuals to consider either the group as a whole (prototype) or specific exemplars (group). When the experiment was repeated using family as the group of reference, group-reference produced recall as much as self-reference. The mean number of recall for the group-reference was higher than self-reference. <b>Participants</b> <b>indicated</b> that they considered both the prototype and individual exemplars when responding to the questions, suggesting that the magnitude of the group-reference effect might not be dependent on the number of exemplars in the target group. Both experiments presented by Johnson et al. found evidence for the group-reference effect. However, these conclusions are limited to the target groups of university students and family. Other research included gender (males and females) and religion (Jewish) as the reference groups and the group-reference effect on memory was not as evident. The group-reference recall for these two groups was not significantly more advantageous than the semantic task. Questioning what characteristics of reference groups that lead to the group-reference effect, a meta-analysis of all four group-reference conditions was performed. This analysis found that self-reference emerged as the most powerful encoding device; however, evidence was found to support the existence of a group-reference effect. The size of the reference groups and number of specific, individual exemplars was hypothesized to influence the existence of the group-reference effect. In addition, accessibility and level of knowledge about group members may also impact such an effect. So, while university students is a much larger group than family, individual exemplars may be more readily accessible than those in a religious group. Similarly, different cognitive representations were hypothesized to influence the group-reference effect. When a larger group is considered, people {{may be more likely to}} consider a prototype which may lead to fewer elaborations and cues later on. Smaller groups may lead to relying on the prototype and specific exemplars. Finally, desirability judgments that influence later processing may be influenced by self-reference and certain group-reference tasks. Individuals may be more sensitive to evaluative implications for the personal self and some group identities, but not others.|$|E
