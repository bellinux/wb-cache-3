40|$|BACKGROUND: Omeprazole {{produces}} a higher intragastric pH {{in the presence}} of Helicobacter pylori infection than after cure. AIM: To investigate whether this effect also occurs with <b>pumaprazole</b> (BY 841), a reversible proton pump antagonist which, in contrast to omeprazole, does not require activation in the acid compartment of the parietal cell. METHODS: In a randomized, crossover, double-blind study, 24 -h intragastric pH was measured in 13 H. pylori-positive subjects before and after a 1 -week course of omeprazole (20 mg o. d.) or of <b>pumaprazole</b> (100 mg b. d.). The studies were repeated after the infection was cured. RESULTS: In the absence of drug administration, the median 24 -h pH values before cure (median 2. 0, 90 % CI: 1. 2 - 3. 2) did not differ from those after cure (median 1. 5, 90 % CI: 1. 3 - 2. 2; P = 0. 115). The 24 -h pH values were higher before cure of the infection than after during both <b>pumaprazole</b> (6. 0, 4. 8 - 6. 7 vs. 4. 3, 2. 6 - 5. 7; P = 0. 002) and omeprazole (5. 8, 4. 0 - 6. 2 vs. 3. 6, 2. 8 - 5; P = 0. 004). Both before and after cure, {{there were no significant differences}} between the two drugs with respect to acid inhibition over the 24 -h period. The median decrease in acid inhibition after cure of the infection (calculated as the difference in H+ activity in mmol/L) during <b>pumaprazole</b> (median 0. 05, 90 % CI: 6 x 10 - 4 - 2. 3) was no different from that during omeprazole (median 0. 2, 90 % CI: 3 x 10 - 3 - 1. 5; P = 0. 6). CONCLUSIONS: Both before and after cure of H. pylori infection, <b>pumaprazole</b> raised the intragastric pH over a 24 -h period to a similar degree as omeprazole. H. pylori infection similarly augments the pH-increasing effect of both drugs. This effect is related to H. pylori infection and not to an increased activation of acid inhibitory agents in the parietal cell compartment...|$|E
