5|$|Amalthea radiates {{slightly}} more heat than it receives from the Sun, which is <b>probably</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> influence of Jovian heat flux (<9 kelvin), sunlight reflected {{from the planet}} (<5K), and charged particle bombardment (<2 K). This is a trait shared with Io, although for different reasons.|$|E
5|$|During late July 2009, a moonlet was {{discovered}} in the B Ring, 480km from {{the outer edge of}} the ring, by the shadow it cast. It is estimated to be 300m in diameter. Unlike the A Ring moonlets (see below), it does not induce a 'propeller' feature, <b>probably</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> density of the B Ring.|$|E
5|$|Hill plotted {{the remains}} of 102 lodges. Pike {{reported}} finding 44 lodges at the village; the difference is <b>probably</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> abandonment or destruction of lodges and the building of new ones on different sites. At least 90 graves have been investigated by archaeologists; an estimated 75–100 additional graves {{are thought to have}} been opened by relic hunters.|$|E

5|$|The {{available}} sources give no {{clue as to}} Albin's {{pattern of}} allegiance in these factional politics, and neither do his recorded activities. Professor Donald Watt has suggested that Albin was probably aligned with the Durward faction, in contrast, for instance, to the allegedly Comyn aligned Clement of Dunblane. Watt even argued that Albin's postulation was <b>probably</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> influence of Alan Durward, {{who at the time}} was a close advisor of King Alexander II.|$|E
5|$|Although sea lochs are the boobries' natural {{home they}} will shelter on land in {{overgrown}} heather. Accounts are inconsistent {{as to the}} extent of the boobrie's habitat. Campbell of Islay claims that it is specific to the lochs of Argyllshire, as does Emeritus Professor of English James MacKillop. The writers Katharine Briggs and Patricia Monaghan on the other hand consider the creature's range to be the broader Scottish Highlands, although Briggs does sometimes specify Argyllshire. Campbell of Islay's undated manuscript notes the boobrie had not been seen for several years <b>probably</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> widespread burning of heather in the area of its habitat.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales have a {{relatively}} small brain compared to their body mass. Like other mammals, their brain has a large, folded cerebrum, {{the part of the}} brain responsible for memory and processing sensory information. Their cerebrum only makes up about 68% of their brain's weight, as opposed to human's 83%. The cerebellum, {{the part of the brain}} responsible for balance and coordination, makes up 18% of their brain's weight, compared to 10% in humans, which is <b>probably</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> great degree of control necessary for constantly swimming. Necropsies on the brains of gray whales revealed iron oxide particles, which may allow them to find magnetic north like a compass.|$|E

40|$|EnThe {{zooplankton}} {{composition in}} the "stagno grande" {{of the natural}} oasis "Le Cesine" (LE) was examined for the first time. The community structure was not stable, and different components appeared and/or disappeared during the time lag of the study. A brackish water (oligoaline) community was dominant. The calanoid Calanipeda aquaedulcis and the Rotifera taxocoenose was the main component. The appearence-disappearence of the species (which can be classified as opportunist, and typical of unpredictably stressed environments) is <b>probably</b> <b>dued</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> presence of resting stages in their life cycles...|$|R
50|$|Male {{little red}} kalutas, like several other dasyurid species, die {{shortly after the}} September {{breeding}} season, <b>probably</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> stress. <b>The</b> young are born after a pregnancy of around seven weeks, and are weaned when around four months old.|$|R
5|$|Extant East Asian {{starling}}s, {{such as the}} Bali myna (Leucopsar rothschildi) and the {{white-headed starling}} (Sturnia erythropygia), have similarities with these extinct species in colouration and other features. As the Rodrigues and Mauritius starlings {{seem to be more}} closely related to each other than to the hoopoe starling, which appears to be closer to Southeast Asian starlings, there may have been two separate colonisations of starlings in the Mascarenes from Asia, with the hoopoe starling being the latest arrival. Apart from Madagascar, the Mascarenes were the only islands in the south-west Indian Ocean that contained native starlings. This is <b>probably</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> isolation, varied topography and vegetation of these islands.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, 22.7% of the {{population}} in the Salford USD (Urban Subdivision) were non-white British compared with 15.6% for the surrounding borough. The USD had a slightly larger percentage of Asian and black people. Salford has become a lot more ethnically diverse since the previous census, <b>probably</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> relocation of many BBC establishments from London between 2011 and 2012. This has created lots of jobs and encouraged migration to the area, which was previously very deprived since the loss of many traditional industries in the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} century BC, Theophrastus {{mentioned}} komakon, including it with cinnamon and cassia as an ingredient in aromatic confections. Guillaume Budé and Claudius Salmasius have identified komakon with cubeb, <b>probably</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> resemblance which the word bears to the Javanese name of cubeb, kumukus. This {{is seen as a}} curious evidence of Greek trade with Java in a time earlier than that of Theophrastus. It is unlikely Greeks acquired them from somewhere else, since Javanese growers protected their monopoly of the trade by sterilizing the berries by scalding, ensuring that the vines were unable to be cultivated elsewhere.|$|E
5000|$|The authors {{described}} Liaoningopterus {{as being}} <b>probably</b> a piscivore, <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> long, pointed snout.|$|R
50|$|Rock Creek was platted in 1903, <b>probably</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> mining {{claims in}} the nearby Elkhorn Mountains. By 1913, Rock Creek {{contained}} several general stores and a butcher, but by the 1980s these were gone, with only a grange hall remaining, and <b>probably</b> failed <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nearby successful cities of Haines and Baker.|$|R
50|$|On {{the second}} day Meduza was launched, the portal was blocked in Kazakhstan <b>probably</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> article about <b>the</b> city of Oskemen (Ust-Kamenogorsk).|$|R
5|$|It {{appears that}} after this first wave of {{destruction}} a short-lived revival of Mycenaean culture followed. Mycenaean Greece continues to be mentioned in international affairs, particularly in Hittite records. In c. 1220 BC, the king of Ahhiyawa is again reported to {{have been involved in}} an anti-Hittite uprising in western Anatolia. Another contemporary Hittite account reports that Ahhiyawan ships should avoid Assyrian-controlled harbors, as part of a trade embargo imposed on Assyria. In general, {{in the second half of}} 13th century BC, trade was in decline in the Eastern Mediterranean, most <b>probably</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> unstable political environment there.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{in early}} 348 BC, the Olynthians appealed for help again. The Athenians sent Charidemos, a former general of Kersebleptes {{who had been}} adopted as an Athenian citizen, with 4000 peltasts, 150 cavalry and 18 triremes; of the triremes, 10 were {{probably}} already in his service, and the other 8 may have been those sent to Chares in 349 BC. Charidemus joined up with the Olynthians, and together they attacked the former territory of Olynthos in western Chalkidike. Finally, just before the final siege of Olynthos started, the Olynthians appealed a last time for aid. The Athenians prepared to send a force of citizen hoplites, but they were delayed by the weather, <b>probably</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Etesian winds, and arrive too late to achieve anything.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{preparations}} for the 6th Congress. It was convened a decade after the 5th WPK Congress (in 1970), outside the party norm of a quadrennial meeting. There was no official reason for its postponement, but it was <b>probably</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact that WPK General Secretary Kim Il-sung spent much of the 1970s gathering support (and creating an independent power base) for his son and planned successor Kim Jong-il. In addition, {{a great deal of time}} was spent restructuring party organizations and functions. The primary reason for the 6th Congress was to formalize Kim Jong-il as Kim Il-sung's chosen successor.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Trachylia" [...] part of {{the name}} was <b>probably</b> given <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shape of the islet rocks (and many of the islets {{surrounding}} Crete are named from their shape). For example, see Trachea (cup-shaped Byzantine coins) and Trachylinae (cup-shaped jellyfish).|$|R

5|$|<b>Probably</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{influence}} of Dunstan, the Archbishop of Canterbury (959–988), Ælfheah was elected Bishop of Winchester in 984, and was consecrated on 19October that year. While bishop he was {{largely responsible for}} the construction of a large organ in the cathedral, audible from over a mile (1600m) away and said to require more than 24men to operate. He also built and enlarged the city's churches, and promoted the cult of Swithun and his own predecessor, Æthelwold of Winchester. One act promoting Æthelwold's cult was the translation of Æthelwold's body to a new tomb in the cathedral at Winchester, which Ælfheah presided over on 10 September 996.|$|E
5|$|The {{problems}} of tomb construction {{can be seen}} with tombs of Ramesses III and his father Setnakhte. Setnakhte started to excavate KV11 but broke into the tomb of Amenmesse, so construction was abandoned and he instead usurped the tomb of Twosret, KV14. When looking for a tomb, Ramesses III extended the partly-excavated tomb started by his father. The tomb of Ramesses II returned to an early style, with a bent axis, <b>probably</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> quality of the rock being excavated (following the Esna shale).|$|E
5|$|Throughout its history, Tell Brak was an {{important}} trade center; it was an enterpot of obsidian trade during the Chalcolithic, as it was situated on the river crossing between Anatolia, the Levant and southern Mesopotamia. The countryside was occupied by smaller towns, villages and hamlets, but the city's surroundings were empty within three kilometers. This was <b>probably</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> intensive cultivation in the immediate hinterland, in order to sustain the population. The city manufactured different objects, including chalices made of obsidian and white marble, faience, flint tools and shell inlays. However, evidence exists for a slight shift in production of goods toward manufacturing objects desired in the south, following {{the establishment of the}} Uruk colony.|$|E
50|$|Also <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{south of}} Hampi is this massive rock cut idol of Narasimha, the fierce aspect of Vishnu, 6.7 m high. Originally the idol bore a smaller image of Lakshmi on one knee; this had fallen off, <b>probably</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> vandalism. <b>The</b> Lakshmi statue {{is now in}} the museum at Kamalapuram.|$|R
5000|$|Stock {{footage from}} Godzilla, King Of The Monsters was added as the Americans {{are talking about}} Godzilla's first {{appearance}} but mention that the attack happened in 1956 rather than 1954. (This was <b>probably</b> done <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact of Godzilla, King Of The Monsters release year of 1956) ...|$|R
50|$|Like Callisto, Dione's craters {{lack the}} high-relief {{features}} {{seen on the}} Moon and Mercury; this is <b>probably</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> slumping of <b>the</b> weak icy crust over geologic time.|$|R
5|$|Vesta's {{surface is}} covered by {{regolith}} distinct from that found on the Moon or asteroids such as Itokawa. This is because space weathering acts differently. Vesta's surface shows no significant trace of nanophase iron because the impact speeds on Vesta are too low to make rock melting and vaporization an appreciable process. Instead, regolith evolution is dominated by brecciation and subsequent mixing of bright and dark components. The dark component is <b>probably</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> infall of carbonaceous material, whereas the bright component is the original Vesta basaltic soil.|$|E
5|$|In 1660 the {{population}} of the town (only including the urban parts of the parish) has been estimated at 1,800, which made it the 10th largest town in Devon and Cornwall. The town's population grew to 2,750 by 1750 (meaning it was the 8th largest town) but it then fell rapidly so that it was only 2,275 by 1805 - only the 23rd largest town in Devon and Cornwall. This fall in population, in a period when many other towns grew rapidly, was <b>probably</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> decline in the importance of the cloth trade in this period. The population of the parish changed little {{from the start of the}} 19th century until the 1970s, remaining at around 3,000 (see chart). However it increased rapidly in the last part of the 20th century and the start of the 21st. Cullompton's population growth looks set to continue as Mid Devon's core strategy foresees 95 new dwellings being built per year in the period to 2026.|$|E
5|$|In 972 Oswald {{was made}} Archbishop of York and journeyed to Rome {{to receive a}} pallium from Pope John XIII. It is {{possible}} that he also traveled on Edgar's behalf {{to the court of}} the Emperor Otto I, and that these two journeys had been combined. He continued to hold the see of Worcester in addition to York. The holding of Worcester in addition to York became traditional for almost the next fifty years. Although it was uncanonical, it had many advantages for York in that it added a much richer diocese to their holdings, and one which was more peaceful as well. When Edgar died in 975, Ælfhere, Ealdorman of Mercia, broke up many monastic communities, some of which were Oswald's foundations. Ramsey, however, was not disturbed, <b>probably</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> patronage of Æthelwine, Ealdorman of East Anglia, son of Æthelstan Half-King. Ælfhere was a supporter of Ethelred the Unready, the son of Edgar's third marriage, while Oswald supported the son of Edgar's first marriage, Edward the Martyr, in the dispute over who would succeed King Edgar.|$|E

50|$|In 1937 Fort H. G. Wright's 10-inch and 12-inch {{guns were}} replaced, <b>probably</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> live-fire practice; <b>the</b> 10-inch guns by weapons taken from Fort Wetherill in Rhode Island.|$|R
