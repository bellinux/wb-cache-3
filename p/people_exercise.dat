5000|$|Terminologically, {{the word}} [...] "referendum" [...] rarely {{appears in the}} French constitutions before 1958.

[...] Only Article 3 of the Constitution of 27 October 1946 recognized the people's right to a referendum. In the 20th century, it seems necessary to distinguish between referendum, which implies a decision, with the discussion that results in an opinion. In legal literature the informal terms [...] "référendum consultatif" [...] (advisory referendum) and [...] "consultation référendaire" [...] (referendum), depending on whether one focuses on the action or {{the consequences of the}} action. All of these uses meet the generic definition given above.
