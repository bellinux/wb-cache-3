40|$|Emerging {{evidence}} suggests {{the occurrence of}} comparative decision-making processes in mate choice, questioning the traditional idea of female choice based on rules of absolute preference. In such a scenario, females are expected to use a typical best-of-n sampling strategy, being able to recall previous sampled males based on memory of their quality and location. Accordingly, the quality of preferred mate {{is expected to be}} unrelated to both the number and the sequence of female visits. We found support for these predictions in the <b>peacock</b> <b>blenny,</b> Salaria pavo, a fish where females have the opportunity to evaluate the attractiveness of many males in a short time period and in a restricted spatial range. Indeed, even considering the variability in preference among females, most of them returned to previous sampled males for further evaluations; thus, the preferred male did not represent the last one in the sequence of visited males. Moreover, there was no relationship between the attractiveness of the preferred male and the number of further visits assigned to the other males. Our results suggest the occurrence of a best-of-n mate sampling strategy in the <b>peacock</b> <b>blenny...</b>|$|E
40|$|In the <b>peacock</b> <b>blenny</b> Salaria pavo small sneaker males {{tried to}} steal ‘fertilizations’ at most in two {{different}} nests of large nesting males throughout the breeding season {{and spent most of}} their time associated with a particular nest.

As nesting males were the limiting reproductive resource in this population due to the scarcity of appropriate nest sites, sneakers were likely to maximize their chances of achieving parasitic fertilization of eggs by associating with successful nests...|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} shows cytological {{differences}} between the anal glands of pre-spawning and spawning <b>peacock</b> <b>blennies</b> Salaria pavo.

40|$|In a sex-role {{reversed}} {{population of}} the <b>peacock</b> <b>blenny,</b> Salaria pavo, two alternative male types are present: (a) older and larger nest-holder males that defend nests in which females come to spawn, and (b) younger and smaller sneaker males that mimic female-courtship behaviour and nuptial colouration {{in order to try}} to sneak fertilizations during spawning episodes. In this study the effects of exogenous administration of arginine vasotocin (AVT, 3 μg/g body weight) on the behaviour of nest-holder males, sneakers and females was tested. AVT induced the expression of female courtship behaviour in sneakers and female nuptial colouration in sneakers and in females, but failed to promote the expression of male courtship behaviour in both male types...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} nest {{aggregation}} in courtship behaviour was tested experimentally in an ecologically constrained, sex-role reversed {{population of the}} <b>peacock</b> <b>blenny</b> Salaria pavo. Mixed sex groups of eight males and eight females were tested in experimental tanks, containing eight potential nests either aggregated or dispersed. In the aggregated treatment, males spent more time inside their nests and monopolized other potential nests, causing a female-biased operational sex ratio (OSR). In the aggregated treatment, females also expressed more courtship behaviour. The results in general support the prediction that the aggregation of nests promotes male monopolization of potential nests, resulting in fewer nest-holding males and therefore a female-biased OSR {{that leads to the}} reversal o f sex roles...|$|E
40|$|Morphology and {{endocrinology}} {{were studied}} in two {{populations of the}} <b>peacock</b> <b>blenny</b> Salaria pavo, with different regimes of sexual selection imposed by differences in nest site availability. The <b>peacock</b> <b>blenny</b> is a small, sexually dimorphic benthic fish that presents exclusive paternal care of the clutch and inhabits rocky shores of the Mediterranean and adjacent Atlantic areas. In a population from the Gulf of Trieste (Northern Adriatic sea) inhabiting rocky shores where nest sites are abundant, male–male competition for nests is low, males court females and a low frequency of alternative reproductive tactics (small, parasitic femalemimicking sneaker males that change tactic into nest holders in subsequent breeding seasons) occurs. Conversely at Ria Formosa, a coastal lagoon in Southern Portugal, where nest sites are scarce and highly aggregated, male–male competition for nests is very high, there is sex-role reversal with female courtship and a high frequency of alternative reproductive tactics is observed. Concomitantly, at Ria Formosa nest holder males are larger and present more developed secondary sex characters {{and higher levels of}} 11 KT than at the Gulf of Trieste. However, the gonads of nest holders and parasitic males were larger in the Gulf of Trieste population. Competition for nests at Ria Formosa seems to promote more developed secondary sex characters in nest site scarcity conditions, while competition for females at the Gulf of Trieste seems to be spurring sperm competition among males in populations where nest sites are more abundant. 11 KT was thus associated with the development and expression of secondary sex characters in contrasting environments. These results exemplify how the modulation of behavioral plasticity and secondary sex characters by the social environment can be mediated by androgens...|$|E
40|$|Chemical cues during {{courtship}} in <b>peacock</b> <b>blenny</b> Salaria pavo did not add {{significantly to}} the response of visual stimuli and females did not court when a male was not visible. The results showed that female S. pavo courtship behaviour was elicited exclusively by male visual features and not by a multicomponent signal in different sensory modalities. The time spent by females courting the male and exhibiting the nuptial colouration during visual trials correlated {{with the size of}} the male’s crest, suggesting a signalling function for this trait. Alternative hypothesis for the function of the putative pheromones released by the male’s anal gland are discussed. Evidence that female sexual motivation decreases {{towards the end of the}} breeding season is also provided, which should be considered in future mate choice experiments...|$|E
40|$|Transition {{zones are}} of high {{evolutionary}} interest because unique patterns of spatial variation are often retained. Here, we investigated the phylogeography of the <b>peacock</b> <b>blenny,</b> Salaria pavo, a small marine intertidal fish that inhabits rocky habitats of the Mediterranean and the adjacent Atlantic Ocean. We screened 170 individuals using mitochondrial and nuclear sequence data from eight locations. Four models of genetic structure were tested: panmixia, isolation-by-distance, secondary contact and phylogeographic break. Results indicated clear asymmetric migration from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic but only marginally supported the isolation-by-distance model. Additionally, the species displays an imprint of demographic expansion {{compatible with the}} last glacial maximum. Although {{the existence of a}} refugium in the Mediterranean cannot be discarded, the ancestral lineage most likely originated in the Atlantic, where most of the genetic diversity occurs.

40|$|Video playbacks {{have been}} {{successfully}} applied {{to the study of}} visual communication in several groups of animals. However, this technique is controversial as video monitors are designed with the human visual system in mind. Differences between the visual capabilities of humans and other animals will lead to perceptually different interpretations of video images. We simultaneously presented males and females of the <b>peacock</b> <b>blenny,</b> Salaria pavo, with a live conspecific male and an online video image of the same individual. Video images failed to elicit appropriate responses. Males were aggressive towards the live male but not towards video images of the same male. Similarly, females courted only the live male and spent more time near this stimulus. In contrast, females of the gynogenetic poecilid Poecilia formosa showed an equal preference for a live and video image of a P. mexicana male, suggesting a response to live animals as strong as to video images. We discuss differences between the species that may explain their opposite reaction to video images...|$|E
40|$|Predation and {{microbial}} {{infections are}} the major causes of natural mortality for early life stages of oviparous species. The parental traits reducing the effects of predation are rather well described, whereas antimicrobial mechanisms enhancing offspring survival are largely unexplored. In this paper, we report that a male sexually dimorphic trait, the anal glands, of the redlip blenny (Ophioblennius atlanticus atlanticus) and the <b>peacock</b> <b>blenny</b> (Salaria pavo), two fish species with paternal egg care, produce a mucus enriched with antimicrobial substances. Histological and histochemical analyses showed that the anal glands of these species are characterized by the massive presence of mucus-secreting cells. Anal gland extracts, from both the hydrophilic and the hydrophobic protein fraction, exhibited a lysozyme-like activity. Field observations demonstrated that redlip blenny males, while performing egg care, rub the anal region over the nest internal surface, probably facilitating the transfer of mucus to eggs. These results strongly indicate that this sexually dimorphic trait is involved in egg defence against microbial infections...|$|E
40|$|In {{species in}} which intense intermale {{competition}} for the access to females is present males of lower competitive ability may adopt alternative reproductive tactics (ART) {{to get access to}} mates. These ART translate in many cases into male sexual polymorphism, with individuals following distinctly different tactics. Usually two alternative male morphs can be recognized in species with ART: (1) bourgeois males that compete for access to mates invest in typically male behaviors, such as building elaborated nests or displaying ornaments; and (2) parasitic males that take advantage {{of the success of the}} bourgeois males in attracting females and attempt “sneaker” fertilizations (e. g., sneaker and satellite males). In combtooth blennies (Blenniidae) the co-occurrence of ART and male sexual polymorphism has been described for two temperate species: the <b>peacock</b> <b>blenny,</b> Salaria pavo, and the Azorean rock-pool blenny, Parablennius sanguinolentus parvicornis. Interestingly, while in the <b>peacock</b> <b>blenny</b> the alternative male morph adopts a sneaker tactic, in the rock-pool blenny parasitic males act as satellites to nest-holder males. Thus, this variation in the ART expressed in these two closely related species allows for a comparative study of the proximate and ultimate factors affecting the expression of the two ART. In this article we summarize the available information on androgen levels in bourgeois and parasitic males of natural populations of the two species and of recent studies on the effect of exogenous administration of androgens on tactic switching in parasitic males of the two species. The information is discussed within the frame of the relative plasticity hypothesis, which predicts that plastic alternative morphs should show differences in hormone levels and that the administration of sex steroids should be effective in promoting the switch from the parasitic to bourgeois tactic. The evidence is only partly consistent with this hypothesis. Alternatively, a social transduction hypothesis that better fits the available data on androgens and ART in teleost is proposed. It states that the observed differences in androgen levels between alternative morphs should not be interpreted as an organization vs activation effect of steroids, but rather as the limited vs lifelong responsiveness of the neuroendocrine axis to social regulation...|$|E
40|$|The {{ecology and}} mating system of two {{populations of the}} <b>peacock</b> <b>blenny</b> Salaria pavo that have been {{reported}} to differ in sexual behaviour were studied. In the Gulf of Trieste, a northern Adriatic Sea population lives in rocky shores, whilst in the Ria Formosa, an Atlantic population inhabits a coastal lagoon with sandy barrier islands. In the Gulf of Trieste, nest availability was found to be higher and nest aggregation lower than in Ria Formosa. Nesting males courted females more and in higher proportion, and inversely, females directed less courtship displays towards nest holders in the Gulf of Trieste than in Ria Formosa. The relative frequency of small female-like males that reproduce by parasitically fertilizing eggs in the larger males’ nests was lower in the Gulf of Trieste population. This variation in the sexual behaviour of nesting males and females is likely to reflect a plastic behavioural response to the varying ecological conditions. The difference between populations in the relative frequency of parasitic males suggests that the male alternative reproductive tactics are condition-dependent...|$|E
40|$|Male peacock {{blennies}} (Salaria pavo) release odors {{from their}} anal glands and, possibly, from their gonads that attract reproductive females. The current {{study investigated the}} effects of 11 -ketotestosterone (KT) on development of the anal glands, testes, and accessory testicular organs {{as well as the}} subsequent olfactory potency of their secretions. After 3 wk of KT treatment (5 mg/kg in silastic implants), clusters of cells secreting neutral mucins differentiated in the anal gland of all treated males, whereas this occurred in only one control male. Secretions by anal glands from KT-treated males elicited greater olfactory responses, as assessed by electro-olfactography, than those from controls. Treatment with KT stimulated testicular gland growth and sialomucin secretion but had no clear effect on the germinal region of the testis; KT also stimulated enlargement of, and fluid secretion in, the blind pouches (paired evaginations of the spermatic ducts). Secretions by the testes and fluid in blind pouches from KT-treated males elicited greater olfactory responses than those from controls. In conclusion, KT stimulates development of the anal glands and testicular accessory organs and promotes odorant secretion, the putative multicomponent male <b>peacock</b> <b>blenny</b> pheromone...|$|E
40|$|In {{several species}} with size {{dependent}} male mating success less competitive males may adopt alternative mating tactics to reproduce (Gross, 1996). Thus, two mating tactics can {{be adopted by}} males, a bourgeois tactic, used by males that actively compete and invest in the acquisition of mates, and a parasitic tactic, adopted by males that exploit the investment of bourgeois males {{to get access to}} females and fertilize eggs (Taborsky, 1997). These alternative reproductive tactics are widespread in teleost fishes, i. e. 140 species of 28 families (Taborsky, 1998). In blenniid fishes two species in which alternative reproductive tactics occur are the <b>peacock</b> <b>blenny</b> Salaria pavo (Risso, 1810) and the Azorean rock-pool blenny Parablennius sanguinolentus parvicornis (Valenciennes in Cuvier & Valenciennes, 1836) (Santos, 1985; Ruchon et al., 1995; Gonçalves et al., 1996). Interestingly, the tactic used by the kleptogamic males is different between these two species, which offers a unique opportunity for a comparative study of alternative reproductive tactics in closely related species. In two populations of S. pavo living in coastal lagoons, Ria Formosa, Algarve, Portugal and Mauguio Lagoon, Gulf of Lion, France, where nest space is very scarce...|$|E
40|$|Microspectrophotometry (MSP) {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} a rod and at least two cone classes (mid- and long-wavelength sensitive) in the intertidal <b>peacock</b> <b>blenny</b> Salaria pavo. Both rhodopsin and porphyropsin based visual pigments were found in all fish, together with high individual variation in chromophore ratio. The three morphs (females, males and sneaker males) differed in their spectral sensitivities (as measured with the optomotor response) with sneakers having higher sensitivity at long-wavelengths than either males or females. This longwave displacement of peak sensitivity could be due elevated proportions of porphyropsin visual pigments in the sneakers’ retinae. The lenses of all morphs exhibited a short-wavelength cut-off and an unusual layer of carotenoid was found behind the retinal pigment epithelium and in the outer segments of some cones. These screening pigments could serve a photo-protective role or to improve visual contrast. No short-wave photoreceptors were located using MSP. This indicates that this cone class may be absent or present at very low numbers in the retina. This is the first in depth study of the visual system of a blenniid fish and indicates potential within-species visual variation that {{may be related to the}} species’ habitat and morph-specific behavioural requirements...|$|E
40|$|In an {{investigation}} of the relationship between reproductive success and fluctuating asymmetry (FA) in the <b>peacock</b> <b>blenny</b> Salaria pavo, FA was measured in four bilaterally paired characters in successful and unsuccessful males during the breeding season. Reproductive success among successful males was assessed by calculating the number of eggs the males were defending. Absolute FA values relative to trait size were high for all characters and it is suggested that this could be a consequence of sub-optimal environmental conditions. Two of the traits presented higher absolute FA values suggesting a lower canalization during ontogeny. No difference in FA between successful and unsuccessful males was found and no relationship between FA and number of eggs among the successful males occurred for any of the measured traits. A composite index of FA, that should better reflect overall developmental competence, was also unrelated to reproductive success. These results indicate that FA is not associated with reproductive success among males of S. pavo. Successful males were larger than unsuccessful males and a strong positive correlation was detected between the body length of the parental males and the number of eggs they had in the nest, even when controlling for the internal nest area. Body size may give males a reproductive advantage by being preferred by females and by having an advantage in male-male competition for nests of higher quality...|$|E
40|$|The {{freshwater}} blenny, Salaria fluviatilis, and {{the marine}} <b>peacock</b> <b>blenny,</b> S. pavo, {{are closely related}} and can survive in both freshwater and seawater. Salaria fluviatilis is widespread in rivers and lakes {{in the vicinity of}} the Mediterranean basin, including Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee), and S. pavo is distributed in rocky parts of the Mediterranean coast. This study investigated the effect of salinity acclimation on routine activity level. Fish were accli-mated for three months in 0 %, 40 %, and 100 % seawater mixed with 100 %, 60 %, and 0 % dechlorinated tap water (< 2, 14. 4, and 36 ppt sea salt, respec-tively). The fish were then placed in aquaria equipped with IR beam projec-tors and detectors set up to count their activity level in the different salinities under a photoperiod of 14 : 10 L:D. S. pavo demonstrated a simple daily rhythm of activity, being active during the light phase, whereas S. fluviatilis was also active in the light phase, but demonstrated a bimodal activity pattern. In both species, activity decreased during the acclimation period. The bimodal daily activity pattern of S. fluviatilis might be a result of the daily wind regime on Lake Kinneret in summer (May–October). The activity reduction in lower or higher salinities (in relation to natural habitat) is suggested to be a tertiary stress response...|$|E
40|$|In general, animals {{prefer to}} mate with {{individuals}} they have observed being courted or in close association with sexual partners. This phenomenon of mate copying has been demonstrated in several species, but so far no study has provided substantial evidence that it is adaptive. Furthermore, mate copying has been viewed only {{in the context of}} females copying other females or males copying other males. In the <b>peacock</b> <b>blenny,</b> Salaria pavo, parasitic males (sneakers) may gain an advantage by copying the association patterns of females with bourgeois males (large males that defend nests). We tested the sneaker’s preference for one of two males and subsequently presented the nonpreferred male to the sneaker in the company of females, while the preferred male was presented alone. If the association of females with bourgeois males influences the sneaker’s preference, we predicted the sneaker would spend more time close to the nonpreferred male, when females were no longer present. We found that (1) sneakers preferred to associate with the larger of the two males and (2) when the previously nonpreferred male was presented in the company of females the sneakers tended to approach that male sooner, although not significantly so, and to spend more time close to it. Thus, parasitic males seem to choose host males both by independent mechanisms (larger males were preferred) and by nonindependent mechanisms (males observed with females were preferred). We discuss the adaptive value of sneakers choosing males by each of these mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|In maximizing {{reproductive}} success, individuals face {{a trade-off}} between parental {{care for their}} current offspring and investing in androgen-dependent sexual traits to produce further offspring. It has thus been proposed that parental effort would suppress androgen levels. Here, we studied parental effort by manipulating brood size in the <b>peacock</b> <b>blenny,</b> Salaria pavo, a littoral fish species in which males show long periods of paternal care. We focused {{on the effects of}} brood size on female spawning rate (measured as number of eggs received in the nest by focal males) and androgen levels. We found a positive linear relationship between brood size and the number of eggs received subsequently. Accordingly, spawning rate increased for males with experimentally enlarged broods while it decreased for males in which brood size was reduced. However, over a longer time interval, brood sizes of both treatments returned to the nonmanipulated brood size, suggesting an effect of additional factors such as male quality. Brood size did not show the expected negative relationship with levels of testosterone and 11 -ketotestosterone. On the contrary, testosterone levels were positively correlated with brood size. However, in agreement with the prediction, changes in the level of parental care by manipulation of brood size showed an inverse relationship with testosterone levels. As with brood size, given time, testosterone levels tended to return to nonmanipulated levels. Such changes suggest that males adjust their brood size to an individual value through androgen modulation of courtship or other traits influencing female spawning rate...|$|E
40|$|The use of vision, olfaction, {{and sound}} {{production}} by combtooth blennies (Blenniidae) for {{communication in the}} context of their reproduction is described and discussed. Vision is important as blennies have well-developed visual systems with interspecific variation that may relate to behavioural and lifestyle differences. Moreover, the visual features of males are distinct from those of females and the great intra- and interspecific variation of their rich repertoire of courtship and agonistic visual displays reinforces the idea that communication using vision is important in reproduction. The <b>peacock</b> <b>blenny</b> (Salaria pavo) has been studied with respect to chemical communication. Males release putative pheromones from anal-fin glands and testicular accessory organs, the production of which depends on androgen plasma levels. Females are attracted to the, apparently, multi-component male pheromone through their sense of olfaction. Given that all male blennies studied so far have testicular accessory organs and epidermal glands on their fin, it is possible that the use of sex pheromones is widespread in this fish group. Very little is known about sound production and reception in blennies, since there is only one study showing that male rock-pool blennies (Parablennius sanguinolentus parvicornis) produce grunt-like calls during courtship which may play a role in female spawning decision. The scarcity of studies limits the validity of generalizations on how and why blennies communicate, nevertheless, the use of multimodal signals to achieve reproduction and the potential for communication networks using visual and chemical signals are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Egg and {{offspring}} {{resistance to}} pathogens {{is a major}} determinant of survival and has been mainly ascribed to maternal factors. However, paternal production of antimicrobials was recently suggested to increase offspring survival in species where males perform egg care. 2. In the <b>peacock</b> <b>blenny,</b> Salaria pavo, a demersal spawning species where males exhibit a pair of anal glands producing lysozyme-like compounds, we tested the antimicrobial activity and the egg protection efficacy of these glands. The anal gland secretion (AGS) has an inhibitory effect on the growth of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, including those causing the most severe fish diseases in marine culture. The egg clutches cared for by males deprived of anal glands have a significantly lower survival rate than those cared for by sham-operated males and non-viable eggs showed clear signs of bacterial infection. 3. Anal gland secretion production and its protein content are proportional to gland size. In species where male parental care plays a crucial role in offspring survival, females are expected to assess mates selecting those traits that are reliably associated with parental ability. Hence, we experimentally challenged females with dummy males differing in anal gland size. Females definitely preferred dummy males with larger anal glands, suggesting that their choice is driven by the pursuit of direct fecundity benefits. 4. These findings indicate that antimicrobial production is a crucial component of male parental care. The contribution of antimicrobials to male performance as fathers suggests that the development of traits devoted to this function may influence male attractiveness and be sexually selected...|$|E
40|$|Distinct {{patterns}} of gene expression often underlie intra- and inter-sexual differences, {{and the study}} of this set of co-regulated genes is essential to understand the emergence of complex behavioural phenotypes. Here, we describe the development of a de novo transcriptome and brain gene expression profiles of wild-caught <b>peacock</b> <b>blenny,</b> Salaria pavo, an intertidal fish with sex-role reversal in courtship behaviour (i. e. females are the courting sex) and sequential alternative reproductive tactics in males (i. e. larger and older nest-holder males and smaller and younger sneaker males occur). Sneakers mimic both female's courtship behaviour and nuptial colouration to get access to nests and sneak fertilizations, and later in life transition into nest-holder males. Thus, this species offers the unique opportunity to study how the regulation of gene expression can contribute to intersex phenotypes and to the sequential expression of male and female behavioural phenotypes by the same individual. We found that at the whole brain level, expression of the sneaker tactic was paralleled by broader and divergent gene expression when compared to either females or nest-holder males, which were more similar between themselves. When looking at sex-biased transcripts, sneaker males are intersex rather than being either nest-holder or female-like, and their transcriptome is simultaneously demasculinized for nest-holder-biased transcripts and feminized for female-biased transcripts. These results indicate that evolutionary changes in reproductive plasticity can be achieved through regulation of gene expression, and in particular by varying the magnitude of expression of sex-biased genes, throughout the lifetime of the same individual.

40|$|In the <b>peacock</b> <b>blenny,</b> Salaria pavo, {{a species}} with {{courtship}} sex-role reversal, smaller, younger males mimic the courtship {{behavior and the}} nuptial coloration of females {{in order to get}} access to nests during spawning and to parasitize egg fertilization from nest-holder males. Later in their life, sneakers transform both morphologically and behaviorally into nest-holder males. In the present paper we investigate the activational role of 11 -ketotestosterone (KT), the most potent androgen in most teleost species, to promote the switch between tactics in sneaker males of S. pavo. Sneakers were implanted either with KT or with control (i. e. castor oil) silastic implants. A week after implantation they were subjected to a set of behavioral tests and morphometric measurements. KT treatment promoted the differentiation of secondary sex characters, such as the anal glands, and inhibited the expression of female courtship behavior. KT-treated sneakers also showed a trend toward less frequent display of female nuptial coloration. There was no effect of KT treatment on the expression of typical nest-holder male behavior. Finally, there was no effect of KT treatment on the number or soma size of arginine vasotocin neurons in the preoptic area, which are often associated with the expression of vertebrate sexual behavior. Thus, KT seems to {{play a key role in}} mating tactic switching by inhibiting the expression of female courtship behavior and by promoting the development of male displaying traits (e. g. anal glands). The lack of a KT effect on behavior typical of nest-holding males and vasotocinergic preoptic neurons suggests that a longer time frame or other endocrine/social signals are needed for the initiation of these traits in males that are switching tactics...|$|E

Alternative {{reproductive}} tactics (ARTs) evolve {{when there}} is strong intra-sexual competition between conspecifics for access to mates. Typically, larger Bbourgeois^ males reproduce by securing the access to reproductive resources while smaller Bparasitic^ males reproduce by stealing fertilizations from larger males. A number of factors can influence the reproductive success of each tactic, including intrinsic (e. g. size) and extrinsic (e. g. tactic relative frequency) variables. An example where plastic ARTs occur is the <b>peacock</b> <b>blenny</b> Salaria pavo, with large males reproducing by defending nests and attracting females (bourgeois tactic) and small males reproducing by achieving sneaked fertilizations (parasitic tactic). In this study, we conducted field observations on individually tagged animals to determine their social network and collected eggs from 11 nests to determine the fertilization success of each male tactic. Paternity estimates for 550 offspring indicated an average fertilization success for nest-holder males of 95 %. Nest-holder male morphological traits and social network parameters were tested as predictors of fertilization success, but only the number of sneakers present in the nest-holder’s social networks {{was found to be}} a predictor of paternity loss. Although male morphological traits had been previously found to be strongly correlated with reproductive success of nest-holder males, as measured by the number of eggs collected in the male’s nest, no correlation was found between any of the measured morphological traits and fertilization success for these males. The results suggest a stronger influence of the social environment than of morphological variables in the proportion of lost fertilizations by nest-holder males of this species.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{castration}} and sex steroid manipulations on {{the expression of}} sexual behavior were investigated in a small fish, the <b>peacock</b> <b>blenny,</b> Salaria pavo. In this species, large males defend nests and attract females while small “sneaker” males reproduce by imitating the female morphology and courtship behavior in order to approach nests during spawning events and parasitically fertilize eggs. Sneakers switch into nest holders in their second breeding season, thus displaying both male and female-like sexual behavior during their lifetime. We tested the effects of castration and of an aromatase inhibitor (Fadrozole, F), testosterone (T) or 17 β-estradiol (E 2) implants on the expression of male and female-like behavior in sneakers. Sneakers were either sham-operated, castrated or castrated and implanted with vehicle, F, T+F or E 2 +F. Seven days after the treatment, sneakers were placed in a tank with a nesting male, two ripe females and an available nest. Castrated fish had lower levels of circulating T and increased the time spent displaying female typical nuptial coloration. T implants had the opposite effect, inhibiting the expression of femalelike behavior and coloration. E 2 implants had no {{significant effect on the}} display of sexual behavior but the frequency of aggressive displays decreased. The results agree with previous findings in sneakers of S. pavo that demonstrated an inhibition of female-like behavior by 11 - ketotestosterone (11 -KT). The reported increase in T and 11 -KT production when sneakers change into nest holders may thus contribute to behaviorally defeminize sneakers. Contrarily, both T and E 2 failed to promote male-like behavior, suggesting that behavioral masculization during tactic switching depends on other neuroendocrine mechanisms or that the time length of the experiment was insufficient to induce male-like behavioral changes in sneakers...|$|E

For this, sex steroid plasma levels and aromatase activity (AA) in gonads, whole brain and brain macroareas were determined in sneakers, transitional males (i. e. sneakers undergoing the transition into nesting males), nesting males and females collected in the field. AAwas much higher in ovarian tissue than in testicular tissue and accordingly circulating estradiol levels were highest in females. This supports the view that elevated AA and estradiol levels are associated with the development of a functional ovary. Transitional males are in a non-reproductive phase and had underdeveloped testes when compared with sneakers and nesting males. Testicular AA was approximately 10 times higher in transitional males when compared with sneakers and nesting males, suggesting high AA has a suppressive effect on testicular development. Nesting males had significantly higher plasma levels of both testosterone (T) and 11 -ketotestosterone when compared with the other male morphs and previous studies demonstrated that these androgens suppress female-like displays in sneakers. In the brain, AA was highest in macroareas presumably containing hypothalamic nuclei traditionally associated with the regulation of reproductive behaviors. Overall, females presented the highest levels of brain AA. In male morphs AA increased from sneakers, to transitional males, to nesting males in all brain macroareas. These results suggest that the transition into the nesting male tactic is accompanied both by an increase in testicular androgen production and by a higher conversion of androgens into estrogens in the brain. The increase in androgen production is likely to mediate the development of male secondary sexual characters while the increase in brain AA {{may be related to the}} behavioral changes associated with tactic transition...|$|E
40|$|The <b>peacock</b> <b>blenny,</b> Salaria pavo (Risso 1810), {{typically}} breeds {{in rocky}} {{shores of the}} Mediterranean and adjacent Atlantic coast. Males defend a territory around a hole or cavity wherein females deposit eggs that the male guards until hatching. A pair of exocrine glands on the anal fin (anal glands) of males produces a putative pheromone involved in attraction of reproductively competent females to the nest. We used behavioral assays to assess species specific attraction of reproductively competent females to putative male pheromones, including the anal gland pheromone. Additionally, chromatographic fractions of anal glands and male-conditioned water were tested for olfactory potency in females by electro-olfactogram analysis (EOG). In a flow-through tank or fluviarium, reproductive females were attracted to male-conditioned water and to the anal gland macerate from conspecifics but not to those of a closely related heterospecific. In addition, attraction of reproductive females to conspecific anal gland macerate occurred only during their initial upstream movement in the fluviarium; this was an ephemeral response {{when compared with the}} response to male-conditioned water that attracted females throughout the entire period of observation (5 min). Reproductive females also were attracted during the entire period of observation to water-conditioned by conspecific males whose anal glands had been removed. However, the attraction was more variable than that to water conditioned by intact males. Moreover, females were not attracted to male (without anal glands) odor during their initial upstream movement in the fluviarium. Finally, non-reproductive females were not attracted to the conspecific anal gland macerate. The EOG responses of females to molecular weight fractions and solid-phase extraction and high-performance liquid chromatography fractions of anal gland macerates and male-conditioned water (with and without anal glands) suggest that the anal glands release hydrophilic odorants that consist mainly of molecules smaller than 500 Da. Furthermore, males released potent odorants that do not originate from the anal glands. We hypothesize that females respond to a multi-component male pheromone to find mates. The putative anal gland pheromone is possibly comprised of hydrophilic odorants, whereas the other component(s), presumably of gonadal origin, may be less water-soluble...|$|E
40|$|The <b>peacock</b> <b>blenny</b> Salaria pavo (Risso, 1810) {{is a small}} bottom-living teleost {{found in}} the {{littoral}} zone of the Mediterranean sea and adjacent Atlantic coast. Males occupy holes or crevices in rocks where females come to spawn and the males subsequently guard the eggs. Males develop anal glands from the epidermis {{of the first two}} rays of the anal fin concurrent with development of the gonads. It has previously been shown that this gland is the source of putative sex pheromones that attract females in reproductive condition. Males also possess accessory reproductive organs (testicular glands and blind pouches) which may also produce sex pheromones. This study aimed to test whether male S. pavo have evolved a specialization in the way they produce and release pheromonal signal(s), providing an example where true chemical communication has evolved in fish. Four experimental chapters attempt to answer specific questions. The main results and conclusions of the experiments are summarized as follows. Behavioural and olfactory responses of female Salaria pavo (Pisces: Blenniidae) to putative pheromones from the anal gland of males A pair of anal glands on the anal fin of male Salaria pavo is suggested to be a specialised structure for the production/release of (a) putative sex pheromone(s) that attracts females and affects their mate choice. However, it is not known whether female reproductive condition affects their response to the putative pheromone. Furthermore, the chemical nature of this putative pheromone is unknown. In a flow-through tank or fluviarium, video-tracking locomotion analysis showed that, during the first up-current trajectory in the test area, reproductive females were attracted to water conditioned by males with anal glands but not to water conditioned by the same males after anal gland excision. During the entire observation (5 min), however, the females were attracted to water conditioned by males with, and without, anal glands. Anal gland macerate attracted reproductive females during the first up-current trajectory but did not attract non-reproductive females; reproductive and non-reproductive females were not attracted to the macerate during the entire observation. Using electro-olfactogram recordings in females, we investigated the olfactory potency of: (1) macerate and solid-phase extraction (SPE) fractions of fully developed anal glands; (2) SPE eluates of maleconditioned water before and after excision of partially and fully developed anal glands, and fractions obtained by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography; and (3) molecular-weight fractions of macerated fully developed anal glands. Undifferentiated anal fin-rays and skin macerates were used as control. Altogether, the results suggest that fully developed anal glands secrete hydrophilic odorants comprising mostly molecules smaller than 500 Da but also molecules larger than 10 kDa. In addition, males release to the water less hydrophilic odorants that do not originate from the anal glands. Our study suggests that fully developed anal glands produce and release water-soluble substances acting as putative pheromones for attraction of reproductive females. Since odorants not originating in the anal glands may also contribute to female attraction, we suggest that chemical attraction of females to potential mates involves a multi-component odour comprising the anal gland pheromone plus other odorants. Seasonal cell differentiation promotes odorant secretion in the anal gland of male Salaria pavo (Pisces: Blenniidae) Male Salaria pavo develop anal glands from the epidermis of the first two rays of the anal fin concurrent with development of the gonads. The putative pheromone(s) produced and/or released are olfactory detected and attractive to reproductive females. We investigated the morphologic and cellular characterization of the anal gland during the annual reproductive cycle by histochemistry and electron microscopy, and the odorant secretion by electro-olfactogram (EOG) recording in conspecific females. The anal gland is a highly folded glandular epithelium which contains cells that undergo cyclic differentiation into clusters of secretory cells during the breeding season and then degenerate. Secretory cells produce neutral mucins and neighbour mucous cells produce acidic mucins. The presence of these cells was correlated with olfactory activity; EOG recordings showed that fully developed anal gland secretions, in which secretory cells are present, elicited significantly greater olfactory responses than those of partially developed anal glands, in which the secretory cells are absent. These results suggest that anal gland cell differentiation is responsible for odorant secretion, which could act as sex pheromones. 11 -ketotestosterone stimulates anal gland differentiation and pheromone secretion in the <b>peacock</b> <b>blenny,</b> Salaria pavo (Pisces: Blenniidae) The anal gland of male Salaria pavo undergoes seasonal cell differentiation and produces pheromones that attract reproductive females. This study investigated the effect(s) of the steroid 11 -ketotestosterone (KT), a potent androgen, on anal gland cell differentiation and function. Silastic tubes containing castor oil (control) or KT (5 mg. kg- 1) in castor oil (KT-treated) were implanted in the peritoneal cavity of males. The area of the anal gland was measured weekly. After three weeks, the effect on anal gland cell differentiation was investigated by histochemistry and electron microscopy. The anal glands were incubated in vitro for 24 hours and the olfactory potency of the incubation medium was assessed by electro-olfactogram recording in conspecific females. The anal gland of KT-treated males grew significantly faster than that of controls during the first week. After seven days, characteristic clusters of secretory cells appeared in the anal gland epithelium of all KT-treated males but not in those of controls. Culture medium of anal glands of KT-treated males elicited greater olfactory responses than those from controls. This increase was correlated with the percentage of secretory cells in the anal gland. This study shows that KT stimulates both development and functional structure of the anal gland, promoting putative sex pheromone production. 11 -ketotestosterone stimulates accessory reproductive organs and possible pheromone secretion in the <b>peacock</b> <b>blenny,</b> Salaria pavo (Pisces: Blenniidae) This study investigated the effect(s) of the androgen 11 -ketotestosterone (KT) on the development of testes, testicular glands and blind pouches, and the secretion of possible sex pheromones in Salaria pavo males. Silastic tubes containing castor oil (control) or KT (5 mg. kg- 1) in castor oil (KT-treated) were implanted in the peritoneal cavity. After three weeks, the effect on testis and testicular gland cell differentiation was investigated using histochemistry. The testes plus the testicular glands (testicular tissue) were incubated in vitro for 24 hours. The olfactory potency of the testicular tissue culture medium, and the fluids of the blind pouches and gall bladder, was assessed by electro-olfactogram recording in conspecific females. KT-treated males had larger gonadossomatic index than controls due larger testicular glands; KT stimulated testicular gland growth and sialomucin secretion, but had no effect on the testis. Culture medium of testicular tissue, blind pouch and bile fluids from KT-treated males elicited greater olfactory responses than those from controls. Thus, KT stimulates the development of the testicular gland and blind pouches and promotes odorants production. Together, these odorants could form part of a pheromonal 'bouquet', the production of which is stimulated by KT. Conclusions 1. The anal gland produces and releases putative sex pheromones which attract conspecific reproductive, but not non-reproductive, females. 2. The anal gland produces and releases several water-soluble substances during the breeding season that are detected by the olfactory system of conspecific females. 3. The differentiation of secretory cells in the anal gland during the breeding season seems to be responsible for secretion of odorants which, in turn, act as putative pheromones. 4. The putative sex pheromones from the anal gland are different in chemical nature from those derived from sexual hormones (such as steroids and prostaglandins). Amino acids, peptides and glycoproteins are all candidates. 5. KT stimulates the anal gland development, which is associated with increased putative sex pheromone secretion. 6. KT also stimulates development of the testicular gland and blind pouch which, in turn, may also produce sex pheromones. It is conceivable that these putative sex pheromones are hormone derivatives. This study suggests that male S. pavo produce chemical signals, releasing odorants not only from the anal gland, but also from the testicular glands and blind pouches. These odours could constitute a pheromonal “bouquet”, which is released by parental males to attract reproductive females. The chemical identity of these pheromonal compounds remains unknown. However, this “bouquet” may include hormonal metabolites which could act as hormonal pheromones (as seen in other teleosts) and specific compounds produced by the anal gland which are important in the attraction of reproductive females. This study provides strong evidence that S. pavo has evolved specialization of pheromone production. This species, and probably other blennids, is therefore an example of true chemical communication in fish; such specialization may be due to their particular behavioural ecology and mating strategy, where sexual selection has been an important factor in its evolution...|$|E
40|$|Phenotypic {{change in}} {{response}} to variation in environmental cues has been widely documented in fish. Transitions in social dominance, in particular, {{have been shown to}} induce a rapid switch in reproductive phenotypes in many species. However, this effect has been mainly studied in adults and focused on behavioural transitions. The way social cues constraint the phenotypic development of juveniles remains poorly studied in fish. We tested the importance of social dominance and density in the phenotypic development of juveniles of the <b>peacock</b> <b>blenny</b> Salaria pavo. This species shows sequential male alternative reproductive tactics. In the first breeding season males can reproduce as nest-holders or as parasitic males (female-mimicking), or postpone reproduction; from the following season afterwards all males reproduce as nest-holders. Parasitic males have relatively larger testes that lack a testicular gland, present in the testes of nest-holders. The testicular gland is the main source of androgens in the testes and accordingly nest-holders have higher circulating androgen levels. In addition, exogenous androgen administration to parasitic males promotes the development of secondary sexual characters (SSC) only present in nest-holders such as a head crest and an anal gland. We raised juveniles under a high or low-density treatment and monitored social interactions for 1 month. No significant effect of density on the development of juvenile males was detected. However, within each replicate, the relative body size of juvenile males {{at the beginning of the}} experiment determined their dominance status, with dominant males developing towards the nest-holder morphotype. Dominant males engaged in more nest defence behaviour, showed larger testicular glands, had higher levels of 11 -ketotestosterone (11 -KT) and testosterone (T) and developed more SSC, as compared to subordinate males. However, these effects of social dominance were moderated by body condition as only dominant males in good body condition developed SSC. The effect of social dominance and of the area of the testicular gland on the development of SSC was mediated by 11 -KT and on the expression of nest defence behaviour by T. Interestingly, in spite of the higher androgen levels and more pronounced morphologic development of SSC in dominant individuals, gonadal development was independent of social dominance and most fish still had underdeveloped testis at the end of the experiment. In conclusion, social dominance promoted the development of the testicular gland, an increase in circulating androgen levels and the development of SSC, but did not promote testicular development. This suggests a dissociation of mechanisms underlying sexual maturation and the expression of male reproductive traits. This dissociation seems to be the key for the occurrence of female-mimicking males in this species, which are sexually mature despite lacking the SSC typical of nest-holders...|$|E
