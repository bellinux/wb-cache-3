40|$|This {{research}} {{analyzes the}} {{issue from the}} jurisprudential and social aspects. The social aspect focuses on the existing viewpoints regarding the grounds for addiction and also looks into the jurisprudential decrees by Shiite and Sunni jurisprudents regarding opium, hashish and tobacco. In other words, the research focuses on the impacts of jurisprudential decrees on social issues and vice-versa. The research in order to offer strong proof for subjects under discussion conducts documental studies and extracts jurisprudential, historical and scientific texts. In all, this research promotes one’s knowledge about the chronology of drugs including opiates, hashish and tobacco, their side effects, reasons behind drug addiction and jurisprudential decrees in this regard {{from the viewpoint of}} jurisprudents. From the viewpoint of social philosophy it raises the thought that there is a dialectic relationship between the thought and the environment and necessitates the need for changes in jurisprudential thoughts.

40|$|Drugs {{of abuse}} all share common {{properties}} classically observed {{in human beings}} and laboratory animals. They enhance neural firing and dopamine tone within the nucleus accumbens and produce progressively greater drug-induced motor responses defined as behavioural sensitization. They produce conditioned place preference, a behavioural model of incentive motivation, which highlights the role of environmental cues in drug addiction. They increase brain reward function as seen by a lowering of intracranial self-stimulation thresholds. And last but not least, they are self-administered, and sometimes even abused, and can trigger reinstatement of drug-seeking behaviour in animals extinguished from drug self-administration. It has long been considered that the reinforcing properties of virtually all drugs of abuse, more specifically psychostimulants, are primarily dependent on activation of the mesolimbic dopamine system. However, recent evidence raises the importance of dopamine-independent mechanisms in reward-related behaviours. The overwhelming body of evidence that indicates a critical role for the mesolimbic dopamine system in the reinforcing effect of psychostimulants should not mask the key contribution of other modulatory systems in the brain. This review summarizes the complex and subtle role of several neuropeptidergic systems in various aspects of addictive behaviours observed in laboratory animals exposed to psychostimulants. A special emphasis {{is given to the}} cannabinoid, opioid, nociceptin/orphanin FQ, corticotropin-releasing factor and hypocretin/orexin systems. The relevance of these systems viewed as potential therapeutic targets for drug addiction is discussed in the light of their narrow pharmacological profile and their effectiveness in <b>preventing</b> <b>drug</b> <b>addiction</b> at doses usually not accompanied by severe side effects...|$|E

40|$|<b>Drug</b> <b>addiction</b> is a chronically {{relapsing}} {{disorder that}} has been characterized by (1) compulsion to seek and take the drug, (2) loss of control in limiting intake, and (3) emergence of a negative emotional state (eg, dysphoria, anxiety, irritability) reflecting a motivational withdrawal syndrome when access to the <b>drug</b> is <b>prevented.</b> <b>Drug</b> <b>addiction</b> has been conceptualized as a disorder that involves elements of both impulsivity and compulsivity that yield a composite addiction cycle composed of three stages: ‘binge/intoxication', ‘withdrawal/negative affect', and ‘preoccupation/anticipation' (craving). Animal and human imaging studies have revealed discrete circuits that mediate the three stages of the addiction cycle with key elements of the ventral tegmental area and ventral striatum as {{a focal point for}} the binge/intoxication stage, a key role for the extended amygdala in the withdrawal/negative affect stage, and {{a key role in the}} preoccupation/anticipation stage for a widely distributed network involving the orbitofrontal cortex–dorsal striatum, prefrontal cortex, basolateral amygdala, hippocampus, and insula involved in craving and the cingulate gyrus, dorsolateral prefrontal, and inferior frontal cortices in disrupted inhibitory control. The transition to addiction involves neuroplasticity in all of these structures that may begin with changes in the mesolimbic dopamine system and a cascade of neuroadaptations from the ventral striatum to dorsal striatum and orbitofrontal cortex and eventually dysregulation of the prefrontal cortex, cingulate gyrus, and extended amygdala. The delineation of the neurocircuitry of the evolving stages of the addiction syndrome forms a heuristic basis for the search for the molecular, genetic, and neuropharmacological neuroadaptations that are key to vulnerability for developing and maintaining addiction...|$|R

40|$|BackgroundIn {{the present}} study, we have {{explored}} the link among styles of attachment and psychopathology in drug users. We know that insecure attachment predisposes the individuals {{the development of}} drug-addiction and psychopathological symptoms. However, {{we do not know}} which attachment is more frequent in drug users and which is related to particular psychopathological symptoms. The aim of the present work is to explore the relationship between childhood attachment state of mind, attachment in close relationships, parental bonding and psychopathology in sample of Italian substance users. MethodsWe explored, in a sample of 70 drug users and drug-addicted patients, the childhood attachment state of mind measured by the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI), the attachment in close relationships by the Relationship Questionnaire (RQ) and parental bonding measured by the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI). The Symptom Check-List- 90 -R (SCL- 90 -R) measured psychopathological symptoms. ResultsWe found that parental bonding, rather than state of mind concerning childhood attachment or attachment in close relationships, is related to the psychopathological manifestation of anxiety, hostility, depression and paranoid ideation in the sample. The latter occurs frequently in our sample, independent of state of mind concerning child attachment, attachment in close relationships and parental bonding, suggesting its role either as a factor that favors a bad image of the participants’ own relationships or as a direct effect of consuming drugs. ConclusionThese results have clinical implications on suggesting ways of interventions that <b>prevent</b> <b>drug</b> <b>addiction,</b> which should include the evaluation of attachment in the prodromic phases of substance use onset or rehabilitation programs to prevent and manage psychotic-like symptoms...|$|R

The neuroimaging comparisons suggest that romantic love and <b>drug</b> <b>addiction</b> both display the functional enhancement in reward and emotion regulation network. Except the similar neural changes, romantic love display special function enhancement in social cognition network, while <b>drug</b> <b>addiction</b> display special dysfunction in cognitive control network. The neurochemical comparisons show that there are many similarities in the dopamine (DA) system, while significant differences in oxytocin (OT) system for romantic love and <b>drug</b> <b>addiction.</b> These indicate that the functional alterations in reward and emotion regulation network and the DA system may be the neurophysiological basis of romantic love as a behavioral addiction, and the functional alterations in social cognition network and the OT system may be the neurophysiological basis of romantic love as a prosocial behavior. It seems that the OT system is a critical factor for the development of addiction.

Such an approach can decrease the danger of drugs to the health of individuals and society...|$|R
40|$|<b>Drug</b> <b>addiction</b> is a {{pervasive}} worldwide problem characterized by compulsive drug use that continues despite negative consequences and treatment attempts. Historically, the biological basis of <b>drug</b> <b>addiction</b> has focused principally on neuronal activity. However, despite their {{pivotal role in}} the underlying pathology of <b>drug</b> <b>addiction,</b> neurons {{are not the only}} central nervous system (CNS) component involved. The role of additional cell types, especially the CNS immunocompetent microglial cells, in the development of tolerance and related neuroplastic changes during <b>drug</b> taking, <b>addiction,</b> and withdrawal is also emerging. Within this perspective, this chapter reviews the roles of microglial cells in several aspects of <b>drug</b> <b>addiction</b> and its behavioural consequences, including reward, tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal. The cellular and molecular mechanisms which are particularly recruited will be emphasized. Lastly, we will also summarize the development of pharmacological modulators of microglial activation that offer novel treatment strategies and highlight the need to better understand the roles of microglia in the context of <b>drug</b> <b>addiction.</b> Xiaohui Wang, Thomas A.
