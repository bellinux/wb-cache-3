40|$|The main aims of {{this study}} were to assess grazing impacts on bee {{communities}} in fragmented mediterranean shrubland (<b>phrygana)</b> and woodland habitats that also experience frequent wildfires, and to explain the mechanisms by which these impacts occur. Fieldwork was carried out in 1999 and 2000 on Mount Carmel, in northern Israel, a known hot-spot for bee diversity. Habitats with a range of post-burn ages and varying intensities of cattle grazing were surveyed by transect recording, grazing levels, and the diversity and abundance of both flowers and bees were measured. The species richness of both bees and flowers were highest at moderate to high grazing intensities, and path-analysis indicated that the effects of both grazing and fire on bee diversity were mediated mainly through changes in flower diversity, herb flowers being more important than shrubs. The abundance of bees increased with intensified grazing pressure even at the highest levels surveyed. Surprisingly though, changes in bee abundance at high grazing levels were not caused directly by changes in flower cover. The variation in bee abundance may have been due to higher numbers of solitary bees from the family Halictidae in grazed sites, where compacted ground (nesting resource) and composites (forage resource) were abundant. The effects of grazing on plants were clearest in the intermediate-aged sites, where cattle inhibited the growth of some of the dominant shrubs, creating or maintaining more open patches where light-demanding herbs could grow, thus allowing a diverse flora to develop. Overall, bee communities benefit from a relatively high level of grazing in <b>phrygana.</b> Although bee and flower diversity may decrease under very heavy grazing, the present levels of grazing on Mount Carmel appear to have only beneficial effects on the bee community...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{deals with}} the registration of the plant population (flora) and the respective pollen types {{in the area of}} N. Moudania, Chalkidiki, and the evaluation of their clinical significance. The research region covers the SW part of the prefecture of Chalkidiki and is featured by smooth, mainly flat terrain and only its northern part forms mountainous undulations of approximately 350 m high. According to the classification of the vegetation, as given by Professor Dafis, the research region belongs to the Quercetalia ilicis ordne, the Oleo-Ceratonion alliance (Oleo-lentiscetum association) and partly to the Quercion ilicis alliance. From the phytosociological point of view, the flora of the research region is separated into the following formations: Formations of sandy grounds. The ammophilus flora is limited in extension and poor in number of species. Formations of weeds. The multiple weeds, mainly nitrophilus, appear in wheat-fields and other types of cultivation having especially favorable bionomic conditions of growth. Formations of roadsides, in fields and villages. These formations are found on waysides, in fields, fallow lands, near ruins, sheep-folds, barns, and places surrounding inhabited areas as well as in them. They consist of numerous nitrophilus species, which find perfect conditions of growth in such places. Formations of streams and streamlets. During the summer period, along the sides of streams and streamlets, with non-continual flow, appears a well developed vegetation, which consists of a few tree-like and bush-like species and plenty of underbrush plants. Formations of maquis and <b>phrygana.</b> The maquis are formations, which consist of mediterranean evergreen sclerophyll plants of about 2 - 6 m high. From these, a few are tree-like and plenty are bush-like, with usually small skin-like, dry and dark green leaves. Also scramble plants belong to this formation. The <b>phrygana</b> are formations, that apply to a well configured type of vegetation, consisting of low dry-like bushes. In the research region, the maquis and <b>phrygana</b> formations cover a small part in the northern side. Among the numerous plants, which represent the vegetation of the research region and generally of Chalkidiki, one can find species of important clinical interest. These are anemophilus species, which during blossom period, yield fairly high densities of antigenic pollen grains in atmosphere. The allergenic plants taxa that are of special importance for the research area where shown to be Poaceae, Oleaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Parietaria, Plantago, Artemisia, Platanus, Quercus, Pinus etc. The allergenic pollen types that were distinguished in Chalkidiki belong to the plant taxa: Poaceae, Oleaceae (Olea, Fraxinus), Urticaceae (Parietaria, Urtica), Chenopodiaceae, Plantago, Compositae (Artemisia, Ambrosia), Platanus, Fagaceae (Quercus, Castanea, Fagus), Pinus, Populus, Salix, Ulmus, Rumex, Cupressaceae (Cupressus, Juniperus), Betulaceae (Corylus, Carpinus, Alnus, Ostrya).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} the determination of the seasonal and the altitudinal changes in the production and nutritional quality of grasslands, <b>phrygana</b> and kermes oak shrublands dominated in the Preveza Prefecture rangelands, northwest Greece and their potential representation in a GIS environment. This area is representative of the prevailing range types of Epirus (grasslands, <b>phrygana</b> and shrublands) presenting a gradual increase in the above sea altitude from 2 to 1640 m. The results of this study showed that the climatic factors such as air temperature and precipitation significantly differ (P< 0, 05) among altitudinal zones creating by this way a special microclimate in every altitudinal zone. The monthly rainfall value positively correlated with altitude (r= 0, 239) and negatively with the average monthly air temperature value (r =- 0, 642), which furthermore is negatively correlated with altitude (r =- 0, 485). Soil’s physical and chemical properties are significantly affected by the altitudinal zone, although range types significantly affected mostly the soil’s chemical properties, indicating that each plant community created its own soil microenvironmental conditions. After the 2 years of observation, we concluded that altitudinal zone strongly affected the production and the nutritive value of forages. The month of harvest strongly affected the production and nutritive value of forage components, firstly by giving a significant positive correlation among average monthly temperature, production, cell wall contents and secondly, a negative correlation among average monthly rainfall, IVDMD and lignin content. Also, the kermes oak browse, especially the leaves, had CP content adequate to fulfil the nutrient requirements of grazing goats throughout the grazing period. However, this browse is characterized by a very low IVDMD during summer. The results of the Kriging method for predicting the values of the seasonal dry matter production and the most important factors affecting the nutritional value showed an underestimation tendency towards the forecasting values. It is concluded that in areas with natural alternations the altitudinal zone is an important factor affecting the production and nutritive value of forages. The eco-compatible and sustainable development requires integrated management of all available information. This can be true today due to the geographic information systems (GIS). ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} carried out to examine the {{short-term}} response {{of different types of}} Preveza Prefecture rangelands in Greece to annual rainfall in terms of rain-use efficiency and grazing capacity. The herbaceous and browse rain-use efficiency factors were estimated after a two-year study (2007 - 2008) of 54 sites spread over three different altitudinal zones within Preveza Prefecture, representing typical rangeland conditions. The results indicated that the current grazing-livestock population exceeds the total grazing capacity in the grasslands and <b>phrygana</b> range types, where the lowest values of both grazing capacity and rain use efficiency were observed. Also, the evaluation of the grazing capacity and rain use efficiency factors showed that they were independent of rainfall fluctuations across all range types and altitudinal zones. While these factors can be very useful in range management, long-term results are required to improve the accuracy of the evaluations and also to better understand the interactions between these two factors with the altitudinal zones and the range types in Greece.

40|$|Descriptions of {{vegetation}} communities are {{often based on}} vague semantic terms describing species presence and dominance. For this reason, some researchers advocate the use of fuzzy sets in the statistical classification of plant species data into communities. In this study, spatially referenced vegetation abundance values collected from Greek <b>phrygana</b> were analysed by ordination (DECORANA), and classified on the resulting axes using fuzzy c-means to yield a point data-set representing local memberships in characteristic plant communities. The fuzzy clusters matched vegetation communities noted in the field, which tended to grade into one another, rather than occupying discrete patches. The fuzzy set representation of the community exploited the strengths of detrended correspondence analysis while retaining richer information than a TWINSPAN classification of the same data. Thus, {{in the absence of}} phytosociological benchmarks, meaningful and manageable habitat information could be derived from complex, multivariate species data. We also analysed the influence of the reliability of different surveyors' field observations by multiple sampling at a selected sample location.
