5|$|Early {{attempts}} by Ernest Flagg {{to limit the}} height of New York's skyscrapers in 1896 failed; further unsuccessful attempts followed between 1906 and 1908, and legislation was turned down again in 1909, partially because of pressure from the real estate industry. After 1913, however, the <b>property</b> <b>market</b> in New York entered a recession, and vacancy levels in buildings began to rise. The campaign for change was helped by {{the construction of the}} Equitable Building in 1915 at the estimated cost of $29 million ($10.9 billion in 2010 terms), which rapidly became infamous as its vast height and bulk blocked views and cast neighbours into permanent shade. The real estate industry finally ceased its objections to new legislation, and the 1916 Zoning Resolution was passed.|$|E

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} UK {{commercial}} <b>property</b> <b>markets</b> {{in terms of}} their response to the macroeconomic and supply side policies of the Thatcher Government. The work is structured around three elements: Thatcherism, the macroeconomy and the commercial <b>property</b> <b>markets.</b> These three elements form the basis for a three stage assessment of the economy and commercial <b>property</b> <b>markets</b> from 1979 - 1990. The first stage comprises an assessment of Thatcherism. The discussion establishes the origins of Thatcherism, the main tenets of the ideology of Thatcherism and the policies which were implemented. This allows an informed discussion of the political strategy from which the policies implemented by this government arose. This forms the foundation for the investigation which follows. The discussion of Thatcherism leads into the second stage of the assessment, an investigation {{of the impact of the}} political strategy of Thatcherism on the macroeconomy. A framework drawing on long term and short term cyclical patterns within the UK economy is established. Economic time series data is then used to establish the major changes in the macroeconomy over this period. These are analysed in the light of the preceding discussion of policy. The third stage within this work is a two - fold study of the commercial <b>property</b> <b>markets.</b> The impact on the commercial <b>property</b> <b>markets</b> of changes in the macroeconomy brought about by the Thatcher Government's economic policies is explored. This leads to an investigation of the impact on the commercial <b>property</b> <b>markets</b> of the Thatcher Government's supply side policies. Conclusions are drawn in two areas, changes within the performance and structure of the commercial <b>property</b> <b>markets</b> arising from i) the Thatcher Government's policy response to long term economic change and ii) the Thatcher Government's policies aiming to create short term economic change. This culminates in an increase in the understanding of the impact of government policy on commercial <b>property</b> <b>markets</b> and of the impact of changes in the performance of the commercial <b>property</b> <b>markets</b> in the rest of the economy...|$|R

40|$|Summary. In {{the context}} of {{increasing}} urbanisation, growth of informal settlements and the urbanisation of poverty, this article suggests a conceptual framework to link urban informal <b>property</b> <b>markets</b> and poverty alleviation. Using conceptual tools of the new institutional economics, principally theories of transaction costs and property rights, the framework describes theoretical conditions under which <b>property</b> <b>markets</b> may be a mechanism for capital accumulation for the urban poor. The article highlights knowledge gaps in the literature and argues that the institutional approach holds the most promise for analysing the interface between informal <b>property</b> <b>markets</b> and poverty alleviation. 1...|$|R
40|$|This study {{set out to}} {{investigate}} the relationship between returns in the residential <b>property</b> <b>markets</b> and two key economic variables of output and interest rates. The main focus was on the short-term rates path {{and how it is}} influenced by the Taylor rule fundamentals and in turn, its effect on the returns in the <b>property</b> <b>markets</b> within the developing countries of South Africa, Bulgaria, Lithuania and Czech Republic. A secondary focus was on building a model that can be further developed into a full forecasting model of returns in the residential <b>property</b> <b>markets.</b> Output was found to be a strong driver of returns in the residential <b>property</b> <b>markets</b> across all four countries. Real changes in the economic activity feed into the residential <b>property</b> <b>markets</b> and drives returns. Output can be incorporated into a forecasting framework for returns in the residential <b>property</b> <b>markets</b> within these countries The short-term rate paths within the countries studied were found to be consistent with the Taylor rule but with heavy short run deviations from the rule. Short-term rates deviated from the rule in the short run, but showed a tendency to revert to the rule in subsequent periods. Returns and prices in the <b>property</b> <b>markets</b> were driven by the short-term rates only in two of the emerging markets. For these countries, this link between rate and returns mean there was also a link between monetary policy and returns in the property sector. Similar to the Taylor rule process, property returns in the two emerging markets were found to have short run deviations which could not be explained by interest rates and output. For the purposes of building a fully fledged forecasting model, this model must be expanded to include other explanatory factors. Adding the risk premium as an explanatory variable could be the starting point...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explain how the {{regulatory}} environment created by planning and building regulations interacts with land and <b>property</b> <b>markets.</b> Since this regulatory environment operates as a form of intervention within <b>property</b> <b>markets</b> in general and the development process in particular, it is essential first to understand the nature, structure and operation of land and <b>property</b> <b>markets.</b> These are covered in the first section. The second section identifies the aims and components of the planning system and building regulations. From this basis, four broad types of policy intervention are reviewed in the third section. These cover policies that seek to shape, regulate or stimulate market activity, and those that aim to build state or market capacity to produce desired outcomes. The final section uses the private residential development process as a case study to explore the extent to which state intervention can influence producer-consumer relationships in one important market sector. The paper argues that effective intervention in land and <b>property</b> <b>markets</b> requires the creation of a broad range of policy tools and their appropriate deployment to suit particular market circumstances.
