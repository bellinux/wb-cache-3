40|$|Background. Waste paper {{recycling}} {{is characterized by}} deterioration {{in the content of}} fiber mass on the fourdrinier wire of a <b>paper-making</b> (cardboard-making) <b>machine,</b> which leads to the fiber content increase in the pit water and to an increase in losses of the source fiber raw material with waste water. Objective. The aim of the paper is to evaluate the influence of amphoteric polymer resins (APR) on the fiber content effectiveness on the fourdrinier wire and the pit water contamination degree. Methods. According to standard techniques, the degree of fiber content and water turbidity, which arises in the paper and cardboard production during the formation on the <b>paper-making</b> <b>machine</b> fourdrinier <b>wire,</b> is determined. Results. The graphs of the dependence of the pit water turbidity on the APR consumption for different milling degree for MS- 5 B- 2 and МС- 8 В- 3 waste paper grades have been constructed. The high efficiency of the APR influence on the fiber content degree on the PPM wire is confirmed. The optimal values of technological parameters (milling degree and APR consumption) for the estimation of the APR impact on the pit water quality have been established. It is shown that the most effective APR among the investigated chemical auxiliaries is UltraRez 200, and the optimum consumption of all APR is 4 kg/ton of paper. The investigated APR are located by the effectiveness increasing of the APR influence on the degree of fiber content and the pit water turbidity reduction in the following series: Luresin KS – Eka WS 325 – Kymene 25 X-Cel – UltraRez 200 – Fennostrengt PA 21. Conclusions. The use of APR allows achieving a high degree of fiber retention on the wire up to 97...|$|R

40|$|The problem {{presented}} {{concerned the}} dynamics of a roll press nip, a crucial component in a <b>paper-making</b> <b>machine.</b> Modern commercial <b>paper-making</b> <b>machines</b> are huge items of equipment. They may be {{as long as a}} football field and cost many millions of dollars each. Integrity of the process is extremely important; the paper in such a machine travels so fast (up to 20 km/sec) that a break is viewed as a major calamity and may take many man-hours and dollars to recover from. The size and speed of the machines means that {{it is not easy to}} make measurements as the paper passes through. The hostility of the environment therefore dictates that a thorough theoretical understanding of the important parts of the process is crucial if the processes involved are to be optimized. In this study we do not seek to answer anyone specific question, but rather wish to propose a general framework for modeling the flow and deformation under a roll press nip. Because of the difficulty of making measurements in the nip region and the need to closely control the process, the distributions of pressure, velocity and felt porosity within the nip have traditionally been subjects of great debate. Previous treatments have included lubrication theory models and "Bernoulli" based models. Although some progress may be made using thin layer theory, we shall show the required modeling does not take the form of standard lubrication theory. As far as models based on Bernoulli's equation are concerned, we simply note that the discussion below shows that the drag force exerted by the felt on the liquid is a key physical component of the flow process. Clearly, a full three-phase flow treatment is required. In this study we will thus address the following questions: (i) Is it possible to propose a general theoretical treatment of the roll press nip? (ii) What determines the physics of the water movement within the paper and felt in the roll press nip and how is this connected to the details of the air movement and the deformation of the felt? (iii) When a general model has been proposed, is it possible exploit the geometry within the nip to generate some simple exact solutions? (iv) What are the key non-dimensional parameters in the problem and how large are they likely to be for realistic <b>paper-making</b> <b>machines?</b> A further matter of interest concerns the influence that the size, shape and separation of the rollers have on the whole process. We approach the modeling from a rather general point of view, beginning by including all effects that might be important and then making clearly defined assumptions to simplify the equations. In this way it is possible to make changes to the model if circumstances change...|$|R

In 1804 he succeeded in producing a working machine. A second, improved one, was made the following year and in 1810 eighteen of the complex machines had been erected at various mills.

50|$|Yet, paper {{problems}} still {{plagued the}} publishers; paper was very expensive to haul from California or the East, and attempts at making {{paper in the}} valley were still, for the most part, futile. In 1860 a <b>paper-making</b> <b>machine</b> had been purchased, and set-up in the Deseret Manufacturing Company sugar house factory, but lack of available materials meant a lack of paper. As a result, Brigham Young called George Goddard on a rag-gathering mission. Goddard traveled through the territory collecting rags that would then be turned into paper, {{and was able to}} supply enough to keep the News in production.
