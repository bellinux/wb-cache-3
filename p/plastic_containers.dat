5|$|The Jif <b>plastic</b> <b>containers</b> were {{originally}} made from polythene, and {{were one of}} the original and first blow moulded containers used for food applications. The <b>plastic</b> <b>containers</b> served to replace glass bottles used to package lemon juice. The plastic container was the brainchild of Edward Hack, and the container's design was undertaken by Bill Pugh, the chief plastics designer at Cascelloid. In its development, Pugh carved a core made of wood, covered it with fresh lemon peel to give it a realistic texture, and then cast a plaster mould. This led to the realistic-looking container that significantly resembles a lemon.|$|E
5|$|Both brands are {{packaged}} {{and marketed}} in distinctive packaging. ReaLemon is packaged in plastic bottles {{that includes the}} shape and color of a lemon atop the bottle, and is packaged using a yellow-colored cap. ReaLime is packaged in the same bottle style that includes the shape and color of a lime atop the bottle, and is packaged with a green-colored cap. ReaLemon has also been packaged in the United States in smaller squeeze pack <b>plastic</b> <b>containers</b> that are shaped and colored {{as that of a}} whole lemon. ReaLemon is also packaged in single-serving packets.|$|E
5|$|Other organic {{materials}} such as leather, skin and textiles were treated similarly, by keeping them moist in tanks or sealed <b>plastic</b> <b>containers.</b> Bone and ivory was desalinated to prevent damage from salt crystallisation, as was glass, ceramic and stone. Iron, copper and copper alloy objects were kept moist in a sodium sesquicarbonate solution to prevent oxidisation and reaction with the chlorides that had penetrated the surface. Alloys of lead and pewter are inherently stable in the atmosphere and generally require no special treatment. Silver and gold were the only materials that required no special passive storage.|$|E

5|$|Pre-moulded or {{machined}} components can be {{inserted into the}} cavity while the mould is open, allowing the material injected in the next cycle to form and solidify around them. This process is known as Insert moulding and allows single parts to contain multiple materials. This process {{is often used to}} create plastic parts with protruding metal screws, allowing them to be fastened and unfastened repeatedly. This technique can also be used for In-mould labelling and film lids may also be attached to moulded <b>plastic</b> <b>containers.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{notion of}} lemon juice being packaged inside lemon-shaped and coloured containers {{was the brainchild of}} Edward Hack in the 1950s. Bill Pugh, an English plastics designer, created a prototype based upon Hack's concept. The company Edward Hack, Ltd. then produced and marketed Hax brand lemon juice in the <b>plastic</b> <b>containers,</b> using juice from Sicily. Stanley Wagner of Coldcrops, Ltd. also independently designed a very similar package, which was used for Realemon brand lemon juice. Realemon was later renamed to ReaLem by Coldcrops. Hax lemon juice was the first to be packaged and marketed in said lemon-shaped container, with Coldcrops following shortly thereafter. A later agreement between Hax and Coldcrops led to Hax leaving the lemon juice business, whereby Coldcrops acquired the marketing rights for lemon juice in plastic lemon containers under the ReaLem brand. Coldcrops was acquired by Reckitt and Colman in 1956, which rebranded the product under the Jif brand name.|$|E

25|$|A 2009 {{study found}} that {{drinking}} from polycarbonate bottles increased urinary bisphenolA levels by two thirds, from 1.2 μg/g creatinine to 2 μg/g creatinine. Consumer groups recommend that people wishing to lower their exposure to bisphenolA avoid canned food and polycarbonate <b>plastic</b> <b>containers</b> (which shares resin identification code 7 with many other plastics) unless the packaging indicates the plastic is bisphenolA-free. To avoid the possibility of BPA leaching into food or drink, the National Toxicology Panel recommends avoiding microwaving food in <b>plastic</b> <b>containers,</b> putting plastics in the dishwasher, or using harsh detergents.|$|E
25|$|The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{determined}} in 2008 that the bisphenol A (BPA) in <b>plastic</b> <b>containers</b> is safe when leeched into food, citing chemical industry studies.

Along with the chemicals and the suicide note, they found used artillery shells, spent bullets, belts made of used brass shell casings, and military ammunition boxes.

25|$|West Palm Beach Fire Rescue {{responded to}} the call and found 53-year-old Jorge Barahona {{on the ground and}} 10-year-old Victor Barahona in the cab of the truck.

One fireman was overcome by a strong smell when approaching the truck, and decontamination procedures were started. The bed of the truck was full of <b>plastic</b> <b>containers</b> of chemicals; some unlabeled. The truck was branded with the name of Jorge's pest extermination business, CJ Pest Control, causing investigators to believe the chemicals were pesticides. One unlabeled container held some form of acid, causing firefighters to wonder why an exterminator would have such a chemical. State Troopers were sent to the address of CJ Pest Control, but were unable to contact anyone.|$|E

25|$|The rising {{population}} {{has resulted in}} an increased demand on fish stocks, which are under stress; although {{the creation of the}} Funafuti Conservation Area has provided a fishing exclusion area to help sustain the fish population across the Funafuti lagoon. Population pressure on the resources of Funafuti and inadequate sanitation systems have resulted in pollution. The Waste Operations and Services Act of 2009 provides the legal framework for waste management and pollution control projects funded by the European Union directed at organic waste composting in eco-sanitation systems. The Environment Protection (Litter and Waste Control) Regulation 2013 is intended to improve the management of the importation of non-biodegradable materials.

25|$|Many plastic {{items for}} medical or {{laboratory}} use {{can be made}} from polypropylene because it can withstand the heat in an autoclave. Its heat resistance also enables it to be used as the manufacturing material of consumer-grade kettles. Food containers made from it will not melt in the dishwasher, and do not melt during industrial hot filling processes. For this reason, most plastic tubs for dairy products are polypropylene sealed with aluminum foil (both heat-resistant materials). After the product has cooled, the tubs are often given lids made of a less heat-resistant material, such as LDPE or polystyrene. Such containers provide a good hands-on example of the difference in modulus, since the rubbery (softer, more flexible) feeling of LDPE with respect to polypropylene of the same thickness is readily apparent. Rugged, translucent, reusable <b>plastic</b> <b>containers</b> made {{in a wide variety of}} shapes and sizes for consumers from various companies such as Rubbermaid and Sterilite are commonly made of polypropylene, although the lids are often made of somewhat more flexible LDPE so they can snap on to the container to close it. Polypropylene can also be made into disposable bottles to contain liquid, powdered, or similar consumer products, although HDPE and polyethylene terephthalate are commonly also used to make bottles. Plastic pails, car batteries, wastebaskets, pharmacy prescription bottles, cooler containers, dishes and pitchers are often made of polypropylene or HDPE, both of which commonly have rather similar appearance, feel, and properties at ambient temperature.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of a ten-month period from mid-1955 to early 1956 more than six million of the plastic juice lemons were sold by Coldcrops. This {{initially}} began under the brand name [...] "Realemon", and then after an objection by the then Board of Trade, the name was changed to [...] "ReaLem" [...] and marketed with the slogan [...] "juice in a jiffy". The Board of Trade objected because it was perceived that Coldcrops was possibly passing off their product as the Realemon brand from the United States. During this same time period, Hax was marketing tomato ketchup and brown sauce in custom-shaped <b>plastic</b> <b>containers,</b> for use on restaurant tables. After a long argument about <b>plastic</b> <b>containers,</b> the two companies agreed that they would not compete with one-another, and Coldcrops took the marketing rights for plastic lemons under the ReaLem brand. Coldcrops would market ReaLem lemon juice and agreed to not enter other plastic container markets.|$|E
