25|$|A {{thermocouple}} {{can produce}} current to drive some processes directly, {{without the need}} for extra circuitry and power sources. For example, the power from a thermocouple can activate a valve when a temperature difference arises. The electrical energy generated by a thermocouple is converted from the heat which must be supplied to the hot side to maintain the electric potential. A continuous transfer of heat is necessary because the current flowing through the thermocouple tends to cause the hot side to cool down and the cold side to heat up (the <b>Peltier</b> <b>effect).</b>|$|E
50|$|In other writings, local flow {{variables}} are considered; these {{might be considered}} as classical by analogy with the time-invariant long-term time-averages of flows produced by endlessly repeated cyclic processes; examples with flows are in the thermoelectric phenomena known as the Seebeck and the <b>Peltier</b> <b>effects,</b> considered by Kelvin {{in the nineteenth century}} and by Onsager in the twentieth. These effects occur at metal junctions, which were originally effectively treated as two-dimensional surfaces, with no spatial volume, and no spatial variation.|$|R
