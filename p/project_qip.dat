40|$|BACKGROUND The West Midlands Adult Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Centre {{based at}} Birmingham Heartlands Hospital {{provides}} care for adults with CF in the West Midlands. People with CF {{are prone to}} pulmonary exacerbations, which often require inpatient admission for intravenous antibiotics. We observed that the admission process was efficient during working hours (9 : 00 - 17 : 00, Monday-Friday) when the CF team are routinely available, but out-of-working hours, there were delays in these patients being clerked and receiving their first antibiotic dose. We were concerned that this was resulting in quality and potential safety issues by causing delays in starting treatment and prolonging hospital inpatient stays. We therefore undertook a quality improvement <b>project</b> (<b>QIP)</b> aimed at addressing these issues. An initial survey showed median time to clerk of 5 hours, with 60...|$|E
40|$|Continuous {{improvement}} {{is the core}} of any successful firm. Talking about manufacturing industries, there is huge potential for continuous improvement to be made in various work areas. Such improvement can be made in any section of industry in any form such as quality improvement, waste minimization, system improvement, layout improvement, ergonomics, cost savings, etc. This case study considers an example of a manufacturing firm which wanted to start a quality improvement <b>project</b> (<b>QIP)</b> on its premises. Various products were available, but with dwindling quality levels. However, the real task was the choice of a product for upcoming QIP, as {{it is well known that}} success heavily depends upon the selection of a particular project. This is also because of the amount of effort in terms of time, money and manpower that is put into a project nowadays. The authors' objective was to compare three techniques, namely, cost of poor quality (COPQ), conditional probability and fuzzy TOPSIS for selecting the right project based on this specific firm. The pros and cons of these approaches have also been discussed. This study should prove to be instructive for the realization of QIPs in similar types of industry. (original abstract...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundAn {{outbreak}} of surgical site infection (SSI) due to environmental mycobacteria (EMB) {{occurred in a}} hospital in Eastern India. MethodA quality improvement <b>project</b> (<b>QIP)</b> was undertaken to analyze the causes and prevent further outbreak. Step (1) Proof of the need: Four patients who had undergone pacemaker implantation consecutively during a 10 -day period developed SSI. Step (2) Diagnostic journey: Since all patients developed SSI within 2 months of implantation, a common source of infection was likely. Atypical mycobacteria (AMB) were grown from surgical sites {{as well as from}} the surface of operation table, image intensifier, and lead aprons. It was a rapid growing variety that lacked pigment, a characteristic of EMB with pathogenic potential. The EMB was finally traced to its source, the overhead water tank. Step (3) Remedial journey: By thorough cleaning of the water tank and enriching its chlorine content, the EMB was eliminated from its source. Step (4) Holding the gains: Protocol for cleaning the water tank once in 3 months was made. A checklist was prepared to ensure compliance to asepsis protocol in the operation theater. In the ensuing 5 years, the infection did not recur. ResultThe bacteria that caused SSI were identified as EMB that grew in the water tank and contaminated the operation room. It could be eliminated by appropriate measures. InterpretationWater is a potential reservoir for EMB. Use of the term ‘environmental mycobacteria’ instead of ‘atypical mycobacteria’ will generate awareness about contamination as the cause of SSI...|$|E
40|$|The Quality Improvement Paradigm (QIP) {{offers a}} general {{framework}} for systematically improving an organization's development processes {{in a continuous}} manner. In {{the context of the}} LifeCycleQM <b>project,</b> the general <b>QIP</b> framework was concretized for a specific application area, namely, the balanced improvement of quality assurance (QA) strategies, i. e., a set of systematically applied QA activities. Especially with respect to small and medium-sized enterprises, the encompassing QIP framework presents limited guidance for easy and concrete application. Therefore, individual activities within the QIP framework were refined focusing on QA strategies, and proven measurement procedures such as the defect flow model and knowledge from the area of process improvement (e. g., with regard to individual QA procedures) was integrated for reuse in a practice-oriented manner. The feasibility of the developed approach was initially explored by its application at IBS AG, a medium-sized enterprise, where improvement goals were defined, a corresponding measurement program was established, improvement potential was identified, and concrete improvement suggestions for the QA strategy were derived, assessed, and implemented...|$|R
40|$|Warfarin is {{the most}} {{commonly}} prescribed anticoagulant in the UK and the one most frequently associated with both fatal medication errors and litigation claims [1]. Its life-threatening interactions and side effects are a concern for all doctors. Identifying and implementing solutions to achieve safer prescribing and monitoring is imperative to improve patient safety. The National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) has outlined the major risks associated with anticoagulant therapy and sought to establish safer practice [1]. The monitoring of safety indicators has been highlighted as a solution. This quality improvement <b>project</b> (<b>QIP)</b> introduces a management algorithm for oral anticoagulant therapy in hospital patients, validated through a completed audit cycle. It was completed at one district general hospital (DGH) in England and involved all inpatient wards. Doctors and pharmacists were interviewed to assess {{their knowledge of the}} correct pathways for management of patients on warfarin. The number of errors on hospital warfarin charts was audited over three weeks. These results, coupled with senior haematological advice led to the production of an algorithm illustrating the gold-standard pathway for warfarin management from admission to discharge. It was emailed to all doctors in the Trust and a laminated copy attached to hospital Pneumatic Tube System (PTS) machines. The warfarin charts were re-audited over the following three weeks. The results showed a marked decrease in errors and incomplete anticoagulation referrals as well as a reduction in doctors ’ anxiety around prescribing warfarin. Proble...|$|E
40|$|People {{living with}} heart failure (PLHF) should be {{screened}} for symptoms at every healthcare visit {{since they are}} 3 {{times more likely to}} experience ventricular arrhythmias. This quality improvement <b>project</b> (<b>QIP)</b> compared 3 self-administered HF symptoms questionnaires to determine the best screening tool for a tertiary hospital arrhythmia devices clinic. The instruments included the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ), the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), and the Self-Reported Heart Failure Symptoms (SHEFS) questionnaire. For a 30 -day period, 76 people were eligible to participate in the QIP, with 55 participants included in the final analysis (72. 5 % participation). The questionnaires were compared and assessed with the gold standard laboratory test for HF (NT-proBNP) for sensitivity and specificity. For HF, the SHEFS was the most sensitive (83 %) compared to the NT-proBNP, but the MLHFQ was most specific (89 %). When compared to the MLHFQ as the standard, SHEFS was 71 % sensitive, and 73 % specific for HF. Similarly, when compared to the KCCQ, the SHEFS was both, 75 % specific and sensitive in identifying HF. However, the rate of correlation to a positive or negative NT-proBNP test results was the highest for the SHEFS (87 %). All 3 questionnaires were statistically significant in predicting admission to hospital for HF in the past 6 months (p = 0. 02 to 0. 03). Finally, given the shortest length and simplicity of use, the SHEFS was selected by the stakeholders to be the standard screening tool for the clinic. This project contributes to positive social change by providing the first reported comparison in the literature to implement questionnaires in a clinic to assess symptoms for PLHF attending an arrhythmia devices clinic...|$|E
