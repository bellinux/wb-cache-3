5000|$|On 1 April 2016, the Army {{announced}} it had awarded Heckler and Koch {{a contract with}} a maximum value of $44.5 million as winner of the competition to replace the KAC M110. The weapon selected was not specified, but was likely the H&K G28; H&K is to produce 3,643 rifles. A goal of the effort was to give snipers a weapon that didn't [...] "stick out" [...] as a sniper rifle; with a suppressor, the M110 is 46.5 in, 13 in longer than the M4 carbine. A minimum of 30 CSASS units {{will be used for}} <b>production</b> <b>qualification</b> testing and operational testing over 24 months. H&K later confirmed that a modified G28 had indeed been selected as the CSASS rifle. The G28 is nearly 6 cm (2.5 in) shorter and 1.3 kg (3 lb) lighter than the M110 (unloaded and without a suppressor) and will cost about $12,000 per rifle.|$|E

5000|$|Johnson {{originally}} built a homebuilt Rocket 125 {{which first}} flew in 1942. The Rocket 125 was a low-wing cabin monoplane {{powered by a}} Lycoming O-290 engine. He developed the design into the Rocket 185 with a 185 hp (138 kW) Lycoming O-435-A engine and retractable landing gear. It was a high performance aircraft for the late 1940s with {{a top speed of}} 180 mph (290 km/h). In August 1945, Fred Pittera who had been an Advanced Military Pilot Training instructor on the four-engine B-24 Bomber at the nearby Fort Worth Army Air Field, joined the Johnson Rocket Aircraft as a test pilot, flying the P-39 aircraft look-alike through its various test regimens and finally in late 1945 flew the Johnson Rocket 185 with an FAA flight examiner for its first <b>production</b> <b>qualification</b> approval. A Federal Aviation Authority Type Certificate was issued on 10 September 1946. Introduced in August 1945, the Rocket 185 was pitched with the phrase [...] "get a super-performing airplane for only $5,000 - order your 'Rocket' now!". A sales tour began in June 1946. However, because of its high performance and limited seating (two, sometimes three), the market was limited to experienced pilots and only 18 were built.|$|E

40|$|In 1981, the ALITHALITE ® aluminum-lithium {{project was}} {{established}} at Alcoa Laboratories, {{with the goal}} of developing low-density replacements for a variety of incumbent aerospace aluminum products. 1987 finds one of these alloys, 2090, production-ready in a range of products and a variety of tempers. Sufficient development of both sheet and extruded shapes permits the establishing of tentative mechanical property limits for several medium to highstrength targets. Thin plate, which generally is more cost-efficient than heavy-gage plate, also is being produced in several tempers. The property trade-offs arnong these various products will be discussed, as well as the limitations with regard to production capacity. A significant impediment to the <b>production</b> <b>qualification</b> of Al-Li alloys has been the difficulty in casting clean, high-quality ingot for product fabrication. Solving this problern has been crucial {{to the success of the}} project, especially in the high-strength products which alloy 2090 offers. As Al-Li moves toward production applications, a number of commercial issues are beginning to surface. Among these are rationalization of alloys and products, availability of qualification testing data, and establishing industry or producer-customer specifications.

40|$|The Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) Thermal Protection Systems (TPS) Materials Research Laboratory is {{currently}} investigating environmentally friendly blowing agents {{for use in}} the insulations of the Space Shuttle's External Tank. The original TPS foam materials of the External Tank were blown with chlorofluorocarbon 11, which is now regulated because of its high Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP). Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), with an ODP that is one tenth that of CFCs, have been widely adopted as an interim blowing agent in urethane insulations. In FY 96, Lockheed Martin completed the <b>production</b> <b>qualification</b> and validation of HCFC 141 b blown insulations. Because of the expected limited commercial lifetime of HCFC 141 b, research efforts are underway to identify and develop alternatives with zero ODP. HFC 245 fa (1, 1, 1, 3, 3 -pentaflouropropane) has been chosen by the manufacturer as a third-generation blowing agent to be marketed commercially. Preliminary work evaluating this third-generation candidate has demonstrated promising material mechanical property data. Favorable results from small-scale spray activities have justified evaluations using production foam processing spray parameters. With the scale-up of the spray equipment, however, additional processing issues have been identified. This paper will present data collected to date regarding the use of this blowing agent in External Tank spray foams...|$|E
40|$|The Pixel Detector of the ATLAS {{experiment}} {{has shown}} excellent performance {{during the whole}} Run- 1 of LHC. Taking advantage of the long shutdown, the detector was extracted from the experiment and brought to surface, to equip it with new service quarter panels, to repair the modules and to ease installation of the Insertable B-Layer (IBL). The IBL is a fourth layer of pixel detectors, and has been installed in May 2014 between the existing Pixel Detector and a new smaller radius beam-pipe at a radius of 3. 3 cm. To cope with the high radiation and pixel occupancy due to the proximity to the interaction point, a new read-out chip and two different silicon sensor technologies (planar and 3 D) have been developed. Furthermore, the physics performance will be improved through the reduction of pixel size while, targeting for a low material budget, a new mechanical support using light weight staves and CO 2 based cooling system have been adopted.
