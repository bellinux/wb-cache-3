50|$|This design {{relies on}} the {{evaporative}} process of water to cool the incoming air while simultaneously increasing the relative humidity. A saturated filter is placed at the supply inlet so the natural process of evaporation can cool the supply air. Apart from the energy to drive the fans, water is the only other resource required to provide conditioning to indoor spaces. The effectiveness of evaporative cooling is largely dependent on the humidity of the outside air; dryer air produces more cooling. A study of field performance results in Kuwait revealed that power requirements for an evaporative cooler are approximately 75% less than the power requirements for a conventional <b>packaged</b> <b>unit</b> air-conditioner.

40|$|AbstractHeating, ventilation, {{air-conditioning}} and Refrigeration (HVAC&R) {{systems are}} seldom designed or commissioned properly. The situation leads to abrupt or degradation faults resulting in inefficient energy uses, excessive energy consumption and high service costs. To solve these aforementioned problems, fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) is utilized to firstly detect any abnormal conditions {{of a system}} and then diagnoses and determines their causes. In order to apply this concept in HVAC oversizing designs, this paper proposes the state-of-art procedure of a FDD procedure for analyzing the inherently faulty design (oversizing) of multiple packaged air-conditioning units used to supply cooling for an open space in light commercial buildings. A generic process of FDD for a <b>packaged</b> <b>unit</b> is briefly introduced to efficiently design FDD algorithms and to illustrate an overview picture for new researchers in FDD areas. In the procedures, compressor statuses, time-on and time-off operations and outdoor air temperatures are recorded {{by means of the}} on-board controller of each machine unit. These physical and electrical monitoring data are applied to diagnose and evaluate oversizing level in terms of runtime fraction (RTF) and cycling rate (N). Eventually, an adaptive control is designed and implemented to enhance process recovery for soft-repairing and permanently reducing fault effect caused by oversizing without intervening system operations (non-invasive technology) ...|$|E

40|$|Presented in {{this paper}} is an {{improvement}} over a spring-steel dual-axis accelerometer that we had reported earlier. The fabrication process (which entails wire-cut electro discharge machining of easily accessible and inexpensive spring-steelfoil) and the sensing of the displacement (which is done using off-the-shelf Hall-effect sensors) remain the same. Theimprovements reported here are twofold: (i) the footprint of the packaged accelerometer is reduced from 80 mm square to 40 mm square, and (ii) almost perfect de-coupling and symmetry are achieved between the two in-plane axes of the packageddevice {{as opposed to the}} previous embodiment where this was not the case. Good linearity with about 40 mV/g was measuredalong both the in-plane axes over a range of 0. 1 to 1 g. The first two natural frequencies of the devices are at 30 Hz and 100 Hz, respectively, as per the experiment. The highlights of this work are cost-effective processing, easy integration of the Hall-effect sensing capability on a customised printed circuit board, and inexpensive packaging without overly compromising eitherthe overall size or the sensitivity of the accelerometer. Through this work, we have reaffirmed the practicability of spring-steelaccelerometers towards the eventual goal of making it compete with micro machined silicon accelerometers in terms of sizeand performance. The cost is likely to be much lower for the spring-steel accelerometers than that of silicon accelerometers, especially when the volume of production is low and the sensor is {{to be used as a}} single <b>packaged</b> <b>unit...</b>|$|E

40|$|This Final Report {{covers the}} Cooperative Program {{carried out to}} design and {{optimize}} an enhanced flat-plate energy recovery ventilator and integrate it into a packaged unitary (rooftop) air conditioning unit. The project objective was to optimize {{the design of a}} flat plate energy recovery ventilator (ERV) core that compares favorably to flat plate air-to-air heat exchanger cores on the market and to cost wise to small enthalpy wheel devices. The benefits of an integrated unit incorporating an enhanced ERV core and a downsized heating/cooling unit were characterized and the design of an integrated unit considering performance and cost was optimized. Phase I was to develop and optimize the design of a membrane based heat exchanger core. Phase II was the creation and observation of a system integrated demonstrator unit consisting of the Enhanced Energy Recovery Ventilator (EERV) developed in Phase I coupled to a standard Carrier 50 HJ rooftop packaged unitary air conditioning unit. Phase III was the optimization of the system prior to commercialization based on the knowledge gained in Phase II. To assure that the designs chosen have the possibility of meeting cost objectives, a preliminary manufacturability and production cost study was performed by the Center for Automation Technologies at RPI. Phase I also included a preliminary design for the integrated unit to be further developed in Phase II. This was to assure that the physical design of the heat exchanger designed in Phase I would be acceptable for use in Phase II. An extensive modeling program was performed by the Center for Building Performance & Diagnostics of CMU. Using EnergyPlus as the software, a typical office building with multiple system configurations in multiple climatic zones in the US was simulated. The performance of energy recovery technologies in packaged rooftop HVAC equipment was evaluated. The experimental program carried out in Phases II and III consisted of fabricating and testing a demonstrator unit using Carrier Comfort Network (CCN) based controls. Augmenting the control signals, CCN was also used to monitor and record additional performance data that supported modeling and conceptual understanding. The result of the testing showed that the EERV core developed in Phase I recovered energy in the demonstrator unit at the expected levels based on projections. In fact, at near-ARI conditions the core recovered about one ton of cooling enthalpy when operating with a three-ton rooftop <b>packaged</b> <b>unit...</b>|$|E
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the progress made in development of Direct FuelCell/Turbine (DFC/T{reg_sign}) power plants for generation of clean power {{at very high}} efficiencies. The DFC/T system employs an indirectly heated Turbine Generator to supplement fuel cell generated power. The concept extends the high efficiency of the fuel cell by utilizing the fuel cell's byproduct heat in a Brayton cycle. Features of the DFC/T system include: electrical efficiencies of up to 75 % on natural gas, minimal emissions, reduced carbon dioxide release to the environment, simplicity in design, direct reforming internal to the fuel cell, and potential cost competitiveness with existing combined cycle power plants. Proof-of-concept tests using a sub-MW-class DFC/T power plant at FuelCell Energy's (FCE) Danbury facility were conducted to validate the feasibility of the concept and to measure its potential for electric power production. A 400 kW-class power plant test facility was designed and retrofitted to conduct the tests. The initial series of tests involved integration of a full-size (250 kW) Direct FuelCell stack with a 30 kW Capstone microturbine. The operational aspects of the hybrid system {{in relation to the}} integration of the microturbine with the fuel cell, process flow and thermal balances, and control strategies for power cycling of the system, were investigated. A subsequent series of tests included operation of the sub-MW Direct FuelCell/Turbine power plant with a Capstone C 60 microturbine. The C 60 microturbine extended the range of operation of the hybrid power plant to higher current densities (higher power) than achieved in initial tests using the 30 kW microturbine. The proof-of-concept test results confirmed the stability and controllability of operating a fullsize (250 kW) fuel cell stack in combination with a microturbine. Thermal management of the system was confirmed and power plant operation, using the microturbine as the only source of fresh air supply to the system, was demonstrated. System analyses of 40 MW DFC/T hybrid systems, approaching 75 % efficiency on natural gas, were carried out using CHEMCAD simulation software. The analyses included systems for near-term and long-term deployment. A new concept was developed that was based on clusters of one-MW fuel cell modules as the building blocks. The preliminary design of a 40 MW power plant, including the key equipment layout and the site plan, was completed. The process information and operational data from the proof-of-concept tests were used in the design of 40 MW high efficiency DFC/T power plants. A preliminary cost estimate for the 40 MW DFC/T plant was also prepared. Pilot-scale tests of the cascaded fuel cell concept for achieving high fuel utilizations were conducted. The tests demonstrated that the concept has the potential to offer higher power plant efficiency. Alternate stack flow geometries for increased power output and fuel utilization capabilities were also evaluated. Detailed design of the packaged sub-MW DFC/T Alpha Unit was completed, including equipment and piping layouts, instrumentation, electrical, and structural drawings. The lessons learned from the proof-of-concept tests were incorporated {{in the design of the}} Alpha Unit. The sub-MW <b>packaged</b> <b>unit</b> was fabricated, including integration of the Direct FuelCell{reg_sign} (DFC{reg_sign}) stack module with the mechanical balance-of-plant and electrical balance-of-plant. Factory acceptance tests of the Alpha DFC/T power plant were conducted at Danbury, CT. The Alpha Unit achieved an unsurpassed electrical efficiency of 58 % (LHV natural gas) during the factory tests. The resulting high efficiency in conversion of chemical energy to electricity far exceeded any sub-MW class power generation equipment presently in the market. After successful completion of the factory tests, the unit was shipped to the Billings Clinic in Billings, MT, for field demonstration tests. The DFC/T unit accomplished a major achievement by successfully completing 8000 hours of operation at the Billings site. The Alpha sub-MW DFC/T power plant unit was returned to the factory for post-operation inspection and analysis. The success of the Alpha Unit operation in the field and achievement of the ultra-high efficiency of 58 %, triggered the establishment of a MW-scale commercial product design and development program. Design of a 3 MW (nominal rating) DFC/T Power Plant was completed with an electrical efficiency approaching 60 +% LHV of natural gas depending on the design and performance of the gas turbine. Development efforts incorporated lessons learned from the Alpha sub-MW DFC/T power plant demonstration, as well as design features from FCE's commercial product offerings, the DFC 1500 and DFC 3000 MW-class simple cycle power plants. The 3 MW DFC/T power plant is anticipated to be a superb alternative for large distributed generation applications in locations with high cost-of-electricity...|$|E
