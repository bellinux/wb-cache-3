40|$|The {{literature}} {{indicates that}} there is urgent {{need to address the}} significant gap in our ability to value the <b>contributory</b> interaction of <b>service</b> networks in organisational performance. This paper is primarily concerned with exploring how service (re) configuration is utilised to optimise network performance. The paper will summarise the literature review over the past year in the quest to document how we can understand the <b>contributory</b> value of <b>service</b> innovation networks. It identifies some interesting overlaps in business process management, service science, and network innovation literature. This paper will discuss how failing to account for the value of service networks inhibits our capability to discover and monitor service performance and how this complements the evolvement of service science. This prevents managers from transforming information on network activity and infrastructural capabilities into strategic knowledge. This paper demonstrates how social network analysis (SNA) can be a powerful tool for managers to understand organisational network performance and service interaction...|$|R

25|$|In {{the field}} of health care, various {{measures}} were introduced to improve the quality and availability of health care provision. Free hospital care was introduced for 9 million recipients of social relief, while a <b>contributory</b> medical <b>service</b> for 23 million panel patients was introduced. Pensioners were exempted from paying a 2% health insurance contribution, while improvements in health insurance provision were carried out, as characterised by an expanded sickness insurance scheme, with the inclusion of preventative treatment. The income limit for compulsory sickness insurance was indexed to changes in the wage level (1970) and the right to medical cancer screening for 23.5 million people was introduced. In January 1971, the reduction of sickness allowance in case of hospitalisation was discontinued. That same year, compulsory health insurance was extended to the self-employed. In 1970, the government included nonmedical psychotherapists and psychoanalysts in the national health insurance program.|$|R

40|$|Church {{tradition}} and culture as <b>contributory</b> factors in <b>service</b> to the Kingdom. This study describes how reverend Kálmán Papp (1924 –) {{was able to}} leave his land of origin behind under difficult, unasked-for and compelling circumstances and embrace a new future in a far-off and unknown country. This follows from his spontaneous responding and acting positively {{to the effects of}} cultural interaction and the common denominational factor of the Reformed Church ever present. The study argues in its methodology that it is an oversimplification and a mistake to seek truth by avoiding, underestimating or eliminating the necessary outcome of cultural interaction and church tradition in the choices we make (even theologically) and experiences we have of life. This is the true life story of a church minister who finds his destiny and becomes himself a minister in the service of God’s Kingdom, through faith’s challenges and encounters with the theologies and cultures of his embracing worlds...|$|R
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of port service quality (PSQ) {{has become a}} critical issue in port management. However, previous studies neglect the difficulties in so doing by relying on the resources and capability available at the shipping companies. This study proposes and reports on the testing of a 3 D model for prioritising PSQ attributes by introducing a novel dimension called &# 039;goal difficulty&# 039; into the port <b>service</b> <b>contributory</b> improvement index. The index represents the composite satisfaction index derived from Kano&# 039;s model and the standardised weight derived from IPA. The data for testing the proposed 3 D model were collected from the managers of five major container ports in Asia. The test results were compared against those acquired using 2 D methods (e. g., IPA), and managerial implications were drawn. The newly developed model is expected to help port managers allocate their limited resources efficiently in their prioritisation of PSQ improvement and in optimising port service user needs...|$|R
40|$|The Hungarian {{old-age pension}} system is {{earnings}} related. Old-age pensions depend on life-time employment (the number of <b>contributory</b> years of <b>service</b> until retirement) and on averaged earnings of an annually expanding period begininning with 19882. Therefore labor market trends affect pensions crucially. The intention {{of this paper}} is to identify such effects on present and – particularly- expected future pensions. The approach is longitudinal, focused on birth cohorts approaching pensionable age in the period from 2005 to 2020. Estimates of past and future employment and earnings by sex and educational attainment are essential for estimating their labor market carreers, hence expected entry pensions. 1. From full to low employment Until 1990 the economically active, working age population was almost fully employed, with the level of employment being practically unaffected by economic fluctuations. The transition brought about a decline of nearly 20 percentage points of the aggregate employment ratio in 1990 - 93, which was followed by a partial recovery. A closer inspection, however, reveals that this recovery was almost fully accounted for by shiftin...|$|R

In {{this study}} {{the role and}} {{function}} of an Industrial Strategy in South Africa was investigated {{within the context of}} the Macroeconomic Strategy for rebuilding and restructuring the economy through growth, employment and redistribution and keeping in line with the goals set out. in the Reconstruction and Development Programme. The findings of the research can be summarised as follows: The industrial strategies of the past were seen as a mechanism to protect South Africa's local industries and to support the policy of import substitution. Against this background the current policy documents guiding South Africa's industrial strategy were evaluated. From this it was gathered that the change from a demand side to a supply side industrial strategy is in line with the above policy documents. The industrial strategy is ideally suited to provide a development <b>service</b> <b>contributory</b> to all aspects of economic development (namely the institutional, economical, physical and social aspects thereof). International experience and development information gathered should be used extensively as a continuous planning and evaluation instrument as this will ensure that the industrial strategy is relevant, accountable and influential. In view of the magnitude of economic development challenges in South Africa (inter alia directed towards overcoming the inequalities of the past) the research conclusions reached were a) that the industrial strategy has indeed a rightful place as part of the bigger macro-economic strategy in South Africa, but b) for the industrial strategy to play its economic role to the full, the strategy must keep in line with international developments...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Globally, {{extending}} financial {{protection and}} equitable {{access to health}} services to those outside the formal sector employment is a major challenge for achieving universal coverage. While some favour contributory schemes, others have embraced tax-funded health service cover for those outside the formal sector. This paper critically examines {{the issue of how}} to cover those outside the formal sector through the lens of stakeholder views on the proposed one-time premium payment (OTPP) policy in Ghana. Discussion Ghana in 2004 implemented a National Health Insurance Scheme, based on a <b>contributory</b> model where <b>service</b> benefits are restricted to those who contribute (with some groups exempted from contributing), as the policy direction for moving towards universal coverage. In 2008, the OTPP system was proposed as an alternative way of ensuring coverage for those outside formal sector employment. There are divergent stakeholder views with regard to the meaning of the one-time premium and how it will be financed and sustained. Our stakeholder interviews indicate that the underlying issue being debated is whether the current contributory NHIS model for those outside the formal employment sector should be maintained or whether services for this group should be tax funded. However, {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} these alternatives are not being explored in an explicit or systematic way and are obscured by the considerable confusion about the likely design of the OTPP policy. We attempt to contribute to the broader debate about how best to fund coverage for those outside the formal sector by unpacking some of these issues and pointing to the empirical evidence needed to shed even further light on appropriate funding mechanisms for universal health systems. Summary The Ghanaian debate on OTPP is related to one of the most important challenges facing low- and middle-income countries seeking to achieve a universal health care system. It is critical that there is more extensive debate on the advantages and disadvantages of alternative funding mechanisms, supported by a solid evidence base, and with the policy objective of universal coverage providing the guiding light. </p...|$|R
40|$|Part One: Literature Review.;Title: The Influence of Ward Atmosphere on Male Inpatients with Psychosis.;The {{purpose of}} this review {{was to examine the}} {{literature}} relating to the influence of ward atmosphere on inpatients with a diagnosis of psychosis. A systematic search strategy was used to identify the relevant literature. A methodological critique and data synthesis of all studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria was then conducted. Nineteen studies in total were critically evaluated. The results highlighted that the ward atmosphere can {{have a positive impact on}} patient outcomes such as psychotic symptomatology, mood, attitude, and more general functioning, when it is enhanced to better suit the needs of those with psychosis. Furthermore, many studies highlighted that an ideal ward atmosphere for individuals with a diagnosis of psychosis is calm and supportive and has low levels of "anger and staff control". However, many of these studies had their own limitations, such as small sample sizes and lack of longitudinal studies. More research is needed within this area, particularly with regards to more UK based longitudinal studies with larger sample sizes.;Part Two: Research Report.;Title: Service Attachment: The Relative Contributions of Ward Climate Perceptions and Attachment Anxiety and Avoidance in Male Inpatients with Psychosis.;Present literature suggests that the relationship between mental health services and their clients is becoming increasingly important, particularly since current thinking pertains to the idea that mental health care institutions can represent a positive attachment figure for inpatients. Service attachment relates to mental health services' ability to meet the attachment needs of patients through the provision of a "secure base", which the attachment literature suggests should be the prime function of mental health services. This "secure base" provision is an important consideration, particularly for forensic inpatients where there is a predominance of insecure attachment styles, fragmented attachment histories, and frequent episodes of distress related to their diagnosis of psychosis. The purpose of the current cross-sectional study was to assess whether inpatient perceptions of the ward climate, or their level of attachment anxiety and avoidance, had a greater contribution to their attachment to a service. Male inpatients with a diagnosis of psychosis (N = 76) residing in four regional Medium Secure Units completed questionnaire measures of service attachment, attachment style, and ward climate. Variables were analysed using Pearson product-moment correlations and hierarchical multiple regressions, controlling for negative affect. Results indicated that perceptions of the ward climate contributed more significantly than attachment anxiety and avoidance to service attachment. Furthermore, the element of the ward climate relating to positive therapeutic relationships between staff and patients was more <b>contributory</b> to <b>service</b> attachment over other aspects of the ward climate. The results also highlighted a strong influence of state negative affect on all the measures within the current study highlighting that negative affect should be considered as a main variable in future research rather than solely as a control. Clinical implications relating to the importance of considering the ward environment in inpatient settings and the role of staff supervision and training is discussed.;Part Three: Critical Appraisal.;A reflection on the overall research project is provided. Issues relating to gaining access to and working with this population are discussed...|$|R

This machine-readable version of John Williams' Digest of Welsh Historical Statistics {{is the result of}} a collaboration between the Statistical Directorate of the National Assembly for Wales, the History Data Service and the Centre for Data Digitisation and Analysis at Queen's University Belfast. John Williams' Digest of Welsh Historical Statistics is intended to provide a service for those working on the history of modern Wales. It arises from a belief that the quantitative element is a necessary and important part of the historical record; from an awareness that it was an aspect that was particularly inaccessible for scholars of Welsh history; and from a conviction that some encouragement in the use of quantitative material was necessary. It is modelled on the two volumes dedicated to British historical statistics: Mitchell, B. R. and Deane, P. (1962) Abstract of British historical statistics and Mitchell, B. R. and Jones, H. G.
