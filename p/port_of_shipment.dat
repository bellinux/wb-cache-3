5000|$|Indicating [...] "FOB port {{means that}} the seller pays for {{transportation}} of the goods to the <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>shipment,</b> plus loading costs. The buyer pays the cost of marine freight transport, insurance, unloading, and transportation from the arrival port to the final destination. The passing of risks occurs when the goods are loaded on board at the <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>shipment.</b> For example, [...] "FOB Vancouver" [...] indicates that the seller will pay for transportation of the goods to the port of Vancouver, {{and the cost of}} loading the goods on to the cargo ship (this includes inland haulage, customs clearance, origin documentation charges, demurrage if any, origin port handling charges, in this case Vancouver). The buyer pays for all costs beyond that point, including unloading. Responsibility for the goods is with the seller until the goods are loaded on board the ship. Once the cargo is on board, the buyer assumes the risk.|$|E

25|$|Rattan (from the Malay rotan) is {{the name}} for roughly 600 species of old world {{climbing}} palms belonging to subfamily Calamoideae (from the Greek 'kálamos' = reed). Rattan {{is also known as}} manila, or malacca, named after the <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>shipment</b> Manila and Malacca City, and as manau (from the Malay rotan manau, the trade name for Calamus manan canes in Southeast Asia). The climbing habit is associated with the characteristics of its flexible woody stem, derived typically from a secondary growth, makes rattan a liana rather than a true wood.|$|R

5000|$|The Hague-Visby Rules, a {{convention}} which imposes duties on maritime carriers, {{apply only to}} [...] "carriage of goods by sea between ports in two different states", and thus {{do not apply to}} cabotage shipping. However, section 1(3) of the UK Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971 declares that the Rules [...] "shall have effect ... where the <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>shipment</b> is a port in the United Kingdom, whether or not the carriage is between ports in two different States ...".|$|E
50|$|A {{person is}} liable on summary {{conviction}} {{to a fine}} not exceeding five hundred penalty units or to a term of imprisonment not exceeding two years or to both the fine and the imprisonment when he applies a false trade description to goods; or forges a trademark; or use or possesses an article or instrument to forge a trademark; or sells or exposes for sale or for any purpose of trade or manufacture goods or things to which a forged trademark or false trade description is applied.  In cases where prosecution for an offence goods are imported, evidence of the <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>shipment</b> is prima facie evidence of the place of origin of the goods.|$|E
50|$|The seller {{delivers}} {{when the}} goods are placed alongside the buyer's vessel at the named <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>shipment.</b> This {{means that the}} buyer has to bear all costs and risks of loss of or damage to the goods from that moment. The FAS term requires the seller {{to clear the goods}} for export, which is a reversal from previous Incoterms versions that required the buyer to arrange for export clearance. However, if the parties wish the buyer to clear the goods for export, this should be made clear by adding explicit wording to this effect in the contract of sale. This term should be used only for non-containerized seafreight and inland waterway transport.|$|E
50|$|The modern Sept-Îles {{was built}} rapidly during the {{construction}} of the Quebec North Shore and Labrador Railway, the 357-mile (575 km) railway link to the northern town of Schefferville. The railway was built between 1950 and 1954 by the Iron Ore Company of Canada. Iron ore mined near Schefferville and Wabush, Labrador, was transported on this railway and shipped from the <b>Port</b> <b>of</b> Sept-Îles. <b>Shipment</b> <b>of</b> the important new commodity resulted in investments that turned this into a major port.|$|R

5000|$|There {{are some}} {{reports that the}} locals on the {{adjacent}} mainland were still occasionally hunting this bird for its decorative plumage in the 1920s, but these seem in error, these records probably referring to the blue coua. What is known with certainty is that in 1932, large sums were offered to well-connected animal dealers in Antananarivo for specimens of Delalande's coua, but {{they were unable to}} procure any. The color pattern of the species is unique among couas, which may be a hint that it evolved in fact in the isolation of Nosy Boraha and never occurred anywhere else. Specimens from [...] "Tamatave" [...] probably just indicate their <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>shipment</b> or the location of the animal dealer who procured them.|$|E
5000|$|The {{six weeks}} from 10 July to 20 August was {{referred}} to as [...] "maggot time", because the fish was difficult to conserve in summer, and there were no market southwards for the fish. The Russians recognized this opportunity. They sailed west in the [...] "maggot time" [...] and bought fish, either readily prepared stockfish or salt fish, or they salted the fish themselves in the cargo hold of their vessels. Fish was in demand in Russia due to the Russian Church's frequent fasting days, when only fish and vegetarian food was allowed. The fish was shipped to Arkangelsk, which also was <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>shipment</b> for the grain products being carried to North Norway. In addition to the vessels from Arkangelsk, pomor trade was carried out by vessels from other harbours along the White Sea such as Kem and Onega, and also from smaller places such as Suma, Kolisma, Solotiza, Mudjunga, Saroka and Sjuja.|$|E
50|$|It {{remained}} {{part of the}} Byzantine Empire until 1460, {{becoming the}} seat of an imperial governor, a landing place for Byzantine operations against the Franks, the main <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>shipment</b> (if not always production) for Malmsey wine, {{and one of the}} most dangerous lairs of corsairs in the Levant. The Emperors gave it valuable privileges, attracting Roger de Lluria who sacked the lower town in 1292. The town welcomed the Catalan Company on its way eastward in 1302. In 1397 the Despot of the Morea, Theodore I Palaiologos, deposed the local dynast of Monemvasia, who appealed to Sultan Bayezid I and was reinstated by Turkish troops. In 1419 the rock appears to have come into the possession of Venice, though it soon returned to the Despot. About 1401, the historian George Sphrantzes was born in the town. After the fall of Constantinople in 1453 Monemvasia held out against the threats of Sultan Mehmed II in 1458 and 1460, when it became the only remaining domain of the Despot of the Morea, Thomas Palaiologos, claimant of the Imperial throne. He had no forces to defend it; he offered it to the Sultan, and finally sold it to the Pope.|$|E
50|$|The Nabataeans {{generated}} wealth {{from the}} trade route that passed through their capital, Petra. Frankincense, myrrh and other spices were transported in caravans from Eudaemon, across the Arabian peninsula, through Petra {{and into the}} <b>Port</b> <b>of</b> Gaza for <b>shipment</b> to European markets. The Nabataeans taxed the caravans and provided paid protection services. The wealthy Nabataeans became Antigonus's next target.|$|R

5000|$|The {{construction}} of docks {{had also been}} mooted in 1844 and 1850 but {{the arrival of the}} railway led instead to the {{construction of}} coal staithes. A change in consulting engineer in 1869 resulted in extensive dredging of the harbour but did not greatly improve the prospects <b>of</b> the <b>port.</b> <b>Shipments</b> <b>of</b> coal amounted to over 500,000 tons by 1914 but this was a modest volume when compared to the other regional ports. Robert Rennison notes with regard to the relative lack of prosperity that the port served a [...] "small and discrete coalfield".|$|R
2500|$|Nicknamed [...] "Alice" [...] {{following}} a public vote, the TBM was the 11th largest machine {{of this type}} in the world. Alice bored the twin tunnels in two passes {{to a depth of}} up to 45 metres so as to pass below hard rock, the water table, and sea level. The southbound tunnel, excavated from south to north, was holed through on 29 September 2014.

Since then Puerto Berrío's development has been tied to the railroad. When the railways extended to Medellín in 1914 Puerto Berrio became an important <b>port</b> for <b>shipments</b> <b>of</b> products going over the Magdalena river, distributing Antioquia products to other main ports over the river and exports to through the Caribbean sea.|$|R
5000|$|After Alexander the Great's {{death in}} 323 BC, his empire split among his generals. During the {{conflict}} between Alexander's generals, Antigonus I conquered the Levant and this {{brought him to the}} borders of Edom, just north of Petra. The wealthy Nabataeans became Antigonus's next target, their wealth was generated by revenues from the trade caravans that transported frankincense, myrrh and other spices from Eudaemon in today's Yemen, across the Arabian peninsula, passing through Petra and ending up in the <b>Port</b> <b>of</b> Gaza for <b>shipment</b> to European markets. This wealth distinguished the Nabataeans from other Arab tribes. Antigonus appointed one of his officers to attack the Nabataean [...] "barbarians" [...] and take their herds as booty. The three raids either came to nothing or ended up in disaster for the Greeks.|$|R
25|$|In 1965, Sihanouk {{negotiated}} {{a deal with}} China and North Vietnam. Whereas before Viet Cong and North Vietnamese forces had temporarily move into Cambodian territory, the deal allowed them to build permanent military facilities on Cambodian soil. Cambodia also opened its <b>ports</b> to <b>shipments</b> <b>of</b> military supplies from China and the Soviet Union to the Vietnamese. In exchange for these concessions, {{large amounts of money}} passed {{into the hands of the}} Cambodian elite. In particular, deals were made where China would purchase rice at inflated prices from the Cambodian government. While Sihanouk talked neutrality in public, he had effectively pushed Cambodia directly into the Vietnam War.|$|R

They man most border crossing stations and <b>ports.</b> When <b>shipments</b> <b>of</b> goods arrive at a border crossing or port, customs officers inspect the contents and charge a tax according to the tariff formula for that product.

5000|$|Although still {{popular and}} often {{repeated}}, the Craig legend is apocryphal. Similarly, the Spears {{story is a}} local favorite, rarely repeated outside the county. There likely was no single [...] "inventor" [...] of bourbon, which developed into its present form only in the late 19th century. Essentially any type of grain {{can be used to}} make whiskey, and the practice of aging whiskey and charring the barrels for better flavor had also been known in Europe for centuries. The late date of the Bourbon County etymology has led Louisville historian Michael Veach to dispute its authenticity.

After losing {{many of their}} F-80 pilots who were assigned to Far East Air Force (FEAF) as replacements, all three squadrons were forced to transfer pilots among themselves to maintain a balance of qualified pilots in each unit. As a result, they lost their character as squadrons of the Georgia, Florida and California ANGs. In April 1951 the 116th Fighter-Bomber Group (116 FBG) began receiving brand new F-84E Thunderjets directly from Republic Aviation. On 14 May the 116th Fighter-Bomber Wing (116 FBW) received a Warning Order for an impending transfer, and they expected {{to be transferred to}} Europe.
