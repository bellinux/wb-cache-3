40|$|International audiencePain is {{a complex}} {{biological}} phenomenon that encompasses intricate neurophysiological, behavioural, psychosocial and affective components. Protracted or chronic pain alerts an individual to a possible pathological abnormality and {{is the main reason}} why patients visit a primary care physician. Despite the pervasiveness of chronic pain in the population, the effectiveness of current pharmacological therapies remains woefully inadequate and prolonged treatment often leads to the development of undesirable side-effects. Since the vast majority of chronic pain originates in a specific tissue or group of tissues, it may be advantageous to target pain control in the periphery and thereby circumvent the known risks associated with non-specific systemic treatments. This review spotlights a number of promising targets for peripheral pain control including the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of neuronal ion channels, the family of proteinase activated receptors (PARs), cannabinoids, and opioids. A critical appraisal of these targets in preclinical models of disease is given and their suitability as future <b>peripheral</b> <b>analgesics</b> is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The use of analgesics {{is based}} on the empiric {{administration}} of a given drug with clinical monitoring for efficacy and toxicity. However, individual responses to drugs are influenced by a combination of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors that can sometimes be regulated by genetic factors. Whereas polymorphic drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters may affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs, polymorphic drug targets and disease-related pathways may influence the pharmacodynamic action of drugs. After a usual dose, variations in drug toxicity and inefficacy can be observed depending on the polymorphism, the analgesic considered and {{the presence or absence of}} active metabolites. For opioids, the most studied being morphine, mutations in the ABCB 1 gene, coding for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), and in the micro-opioid receptor reduce morphine potency. Cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 2 D 6 mutations influence the analgesic effect of codeine and tramadol, and polymorphism of CYP 2 C 9 is potentially linked to an increase in nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced adverse events. Furthermore, drug interactions can mimic genetic deficiency and contribute to the variability in response to analgesics. This review summarizes the available data on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic consequences of known polymorphisms of drug-metabolizing enzymes, drug transporters, drug targets and other nonopioid biological systems on central and <b>peripheral</b> <b>analgesics...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: Lidocaine {{hydrochloride}} (LH) {{is one of}} {{the most}} extensively used local anesthetics and <b>peripheral</b> <b>analgesics.</b> Availability of a simple and sensitive assay method for this analyte in pharmaceutical preparations as well as development of new voltammetric detectors that can be applied in chromatographic systems for determination of this analyte in biological samples are of great importance. Objectives: In this study, a square-wave voltammetric (SWV) determination of LH at a bare carbon-paste electrode (CPE) was reported. Moreover, the oxidation mechanism for LH molecule at this electrode was investigated. Materials and Methods: The SW voltammogram of LH solution at CPE showed a well-defined peak between + 0. 80 and + 0. 88 V depending on a scan rate in potassium nitrate (KNO 3) solution. Different chemical and instrumental parameters influencing the voltammetric response, such as the pH level and scan rate were optimized for LH determination. Results: A linear range of 8. 0 - 1000. 0 μmol L- 1 (r 2 = 0. 999) was obtained. The limit of detection (LOD) was 0. 29 μmol L- 1. The relative standard deviations of 2. 1 % obtained for 0. 8 800 μmol L- 1 solution of LH indicated a reasonable reproducibility of the method. Conclusions: The results of this study show that LH in different pharmaceutical preparations could be determined with good reliability.

This work is {{concerned}} with {{an evaluation of the}} use of analgesics in a rheumatological outpatient clinic during the period 1989 - 1999. Methods: The records of 1705 patients consecutively seen at the clinic were downloaded on a specifically built website. Results: 4469 visits were considered. In 260 of them (5. 8 %), analgesics were prescribed to 234 (13. 7 %) patients. The number of patients with a prescription of analgesics steadily increased during the years 1989 - 1999. The diagnoses in patients assuming analgesics were: osteoarthritis (47. 1 %), inflammatory arthritis (24. 2 %), soft tissue rheumatisms (13. 7 %), nonspecific arthralgia/myalgia (7. 5 %), and connective tissue diseases (2. 6 %). <b>Peripheral</b> <b>analgesics</b> were used in 188 (82. 5 %) patients and central analgesics were used in the remaining 40 patients (17. 5 %). Analgesic drugs were used mainly in degenerative joint conditions. The indications for analgesics in the 55 patients with inflammatory arthrits were: (a) partial or total remission of arthritis; for this reason non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were no longer required in 18 patients; (b) to increase the analgesic effect of NSAIDs in 23 patients; (c) contraindications to NSAIDs in 14 patients (renal failure in 2 patients, gastritis in 10, allergy and bleeding in the remaining two). Conclusions: About 14 % of our outpatients were treated with analgesics with an increasing trend in the examined period.

Properties of the opium poppy have been exploited for centuries for the alleviation {{of pain and}} to induce euphoria. Classically thought to produce its effects solely in the central nervous system, <b>peripheral</b> opioid <b>analgesic</b> systems are now widely accepted. The activation of these systems leads {{to a reduction in}} primary afferent fiber excitability leading to the inhibition of sensory transduction. Opioid receptors function is modulated by a variety of mechanisms. An example of this is enhanced peripheral opioid receptor function following inflammation. The present study examined peripheral opioid receptor regulation in early and late stages of CFA inflammation. Additionally, a new model of UVB of inflammation was characterized. Peripheral MOR receptors are differentially regulated in late and early CFA inflammation. Peripheral MOR is not responsible for attenuated responses of nociceptors to mechanical stimuli 18 hours after CFA inflammation. DAMGO reduced mechanical responsiveness of nociceptors at 72 hours after CFA inflammation in a concentration and antagonist reversible manner indicating that MOR efficacy is enhanced during later stages of CFA inflammation. UVB produced severe but localized inflammation that differed from inflammation produced by CFA.

Uma pequena dose de 5 -hydroxytriptamina (5 -HT; 75 mg) que induz resposta comportamental nociceptiva mínima, foi aplicada na região da ATM de ratos 1 h após a injeção de carragenina (C; 100 mg) para detectar a sensibilização induzida pela carragenina na região da ATM, que foi avaliada pela soma das respostas nociceptivas comportamentais, como coçar a região orofacial e levantar a cabeça. O bloqueio da síntese de prostaglandinas pela indometacina sistêmica (2, 5 mg/kg) ou local (10 ?g) antes do início da inflamação pela carragenina diminuiu significativamente a hiperalgesia da ATM.

By using this model, it was investigated whether norepinephrine and local adrenoceptors contribute to the development of inflammatory TMJ hyperalgesia. Carrageenan-induced TMJ hyperalgesia was assessed by measuring the behavioral nociceptive responses, such as rubbing the orofacial region and flinching the head, induced by the injection of a low dose of 5 -hydroxytryptamine into the TMJ sensitized one hour before by a TMJ injection of carrageenan. Blockade of prostaglandin synthesis by indomethacin prior to initiation of inflammation by carrageenan significantly attenuated the TMJ hyperalgesia. The guanethidine depletion of norepinephrine or the blockade of ? 2 but not the blockade of the ? 1 adrenoceptor by the selective adrenoceptor antagonists ICI 118. 551 and atenolol, respectively, significantly reduced carrageenan-induced TMJ hyperalgesia.

40|$|Antidepressants, given systemically, {{are widely}} used for the {{treatment}} of various chronic and neuropathic pain conditions in humans. In animal studies, antidepressants exhibit analgesic properties in nociceptive, inflammatory and neuropathic test systems, with outcomes depending on the specific agent, the particular test, the route of administration and the treatment method used. Although early studies focused on cen-tral (i. e., supraspinal, spinal) actions, more recent studies have demonstrated a local <b>peripheral</b> <b>analgesic</b> effect of antidepressants. These peripheral actions raise the possibility that topical formulations of anti-depressants may be a useful alternative drug delivery system for analgesia. Antidepressants exhibit a num-ber of pharmacological actions: they block reuptake of noradrenaline and 5 -hydroxytryptamine, have di-rect and indirect actions on opioid receptors, inhibit histamine, cholinergic, 5 -hydroxytryptamine and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, inhibit ion channel activity, and block adenosine uptake. The involvement of these mechanisms in both central and peripheral analgesia produced by antidepressants is considered. Data illustrating the preclinical <b>peripheral</b> <b>analgesic</b> actions of antidepressants are presented, as are some aspects of the mechanisms by which these actions occur. Administrés de façon systémique, les antidépresseurs sont fréquemment utilisés pour le traitement de di-verses douleurs chroniques et neuropathiques chez les êtres humains.

30|$|Introduction: Postoperative pain {{might be}} {{ameliorated}} by substituting propofol for sevoflurane anesthesia. Support for this theory comes from human pain models in which propofol reduced hyperalgesia and allodynia {{in response to}} pinprick and electric stimulation. 1 Benefit may result from central and <b>peripheral</b> <b>analgesic</b> effects of sub-hypnotic doses of propofol, as well as suppression of spinal sensitization. 2, 3 Additional analgesic effects of propofol likely result from interactions with N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA), non-NMDA receptors, and via activation of gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptors in the dorsal root ganglion nociceptor cells.|$|E
40|$|Erythrina variegate (asclepidaceae) is a {{plant with}} a variety of ethnic {{medicinal}} uses. Hence an effort has been made to screen the aqueous extract of leaves of erythrina variegate for its analagesic and anti-inflammatory activities. Leaves of erythrina variegate were extracted with water successively. Preliminary phytoichemical investigation was carried out to identify various phytochemical constituents present in the extract. phytochemical investigation: the aqueous extract of leaves of Erythrina variegate showed the presence of alkaloids, carbohydrates, steroids, sapaonins and triterpenes. The toxicity studies; the LD 50 were found to be aqueous extract: 3162 mg/kg, analgesi activity of aqueous extract of leaves of Erythrina variegate has reduced the intendity of acetic acid induced writhing and thermally induced pain stimuli using eddy’s hot plate method in mice, indicating both <b>peripheral</b> and central <b>analgesic</b> activity. Anti-inflammatory activity of aqueous extract has shown significant activity in carrageenan induced paw oedema model in rats. The effect was observed in middle and final phase of inhibition suggesting that extract can block the mediators like kinins and prostaglandins...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{clinical}} pain management {{is complex and}} far-reaching, as it encompasses {{many different types of}} pain, such as arthritis, musculoskeletal conditions, neuropathic pain, and visceral pain. It is widely known that many of the well-established analgesic pathways are centrally based, involving spinal and supraspinal sites. However, pain can also be effectively controlled by <b>peripheral</b> pathways. The <b>analgesics</b> market is growing and the driving forces are the aging population and need for better therapeutic benefits. There are various analgesic products that are available that can be administered by various routes, yet research is active in identifying new technologies for better drug targeting and novel targets to gain improved therapeutic efficiency. This e-Book "PAIN - Novel targets and new technologies" has brought together experts in the field of pain at the physiological, pharmacological and pharmaceutical levels to discuss novel pain targets and new pain technologies across the various types of pain. This information is presented as novel research findings, short communications and review articles. The goal of this e-Book is to generate further collaborative discussion on the future and direction of pain therapies...|$|R
40|$|Ononitol {{monohydrate}} (OM) {{was isolated}} from Cassia tora L. leaves. The anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities of OM {{have been examined}} in male Wistar rats and mice. The efficacy of OM against inflammation was studied by using carrageenan-induced paw oedema, croton oil-induced ear oedema, acetic acid-induced vascular permeability, cotton pellet-induced granuloma and adjuvant-induced arthritis. The analgesic activity of OM was assessed using the acetic acid-induced abdominal constriction response, formalin-induced paw licking response and the hot-plate test. In acute type inflammation models, maximum inhibitions of 50. 69 and 61. 06 % (P < . 05) were noted with 20  mg/kg of OM in carrageenan-induced hind paw oedema and croton oil-induced ear oedema, respectively. Treatment of OM (20  mg/kg) meaningfully (P < . 05) reduced the granuloma tissue formation by cotton pellet study {{at a rate of}} 36. 25 %. OM (20  mg/kg) inhibited 53. 64 % of paw thickness in adjuvant-induced arthritis model. OM has also been produced significant (P < . 05) analgesic activity in acetic acid-induced abdominal constriction response, formalin-induced paw licking response and in hot-plate test suggesting its <b>peripheral</b> and central <b>analgesic</b> potential. The outcomes of the present study proposed that OM influenced on the anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities...|$|R
