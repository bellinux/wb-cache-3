His very last text is believed to be a philosophical essay, Le Lundi existentiel ("The Existential Monday"), on which Fondane was working in 1944.

50|$|Romanesque {{architecture}} {{was very}} popular in Burgundy; its masterpiece is the Cathedral of Saint-Bénigne of Dijon, consecrated by Paschal II in 1106 and completed in 1288. The Gothic style, although less used, characterizes the churches of Notre-Dame de Dijon (1252-1334), Notre-Dame de Semur, and l'Abbaye Saint-Seine; {{it was also the}} style of the Sainte-Chapelle of Dijon, which is no longer in existence. Under the dukes of Burgundy, {{at the close of the}} 14th and beginning of the 15th century, Burgundian art flourished in a surprising degree. The Chartreuse de Champmol, on which Philip the Bold had Claus Sluter, the sculptor, at work from 1389 to 1406, and which was the acme of artistic excellence, was almost totally destroyed during the Revolution; however, two superb traces of it may still be seen, namely the <b>Puits</b> <b>des</b> prophètes and the portal of the church. The Beaune hospital (1443) is a fine specimen of the Gothic style, and the church of Saint-Michel in Dijon (1497) has 16th- and 17th-century porches covered with fantastic bas-reliefs. The Abbeys of Cîteaux, Fontenay, and Flavigny (where in the 19th century Père Lacordaire installed a Dominican novitiate) were all within the territory of Dijon.|$|R

5000|$|Under the Ottoman Empire, in 1596, Jubb Yusuf {{was officially}} a nahiya ("subdistrict") of Jira, part of Sanjak Safad, with a {{population}} of seventy-two. It paid taxes on crops such as wheat, barley, and fruit, and on goats and beehives.In the early 18th century the scholar and Sufi Abd al-Ghani al-Nabulsi mentioned the khan, the domed well which still exists, and a nearby mosque. A map from Napoleon's invasion of 1799 by Pierre Jacotin showed the place, named as <b>Puits</b> <b>de</b> Joseph. The Swiss traveller Johann Ludwig Burckhardt observed during his visit around 1816 that the khan was falling into ruin. The mosque was dismantled around the beginning of the 19th century and the stones used to build a sheep fence closed to the khan. The village by that time appears to have had few inhabitants, possibly because the well was no longer usable after the Galilee earthquake of 1837, leaving only one small, seasonal source of water nearby. An 1877 survey of the Galilee carried out by the Palestine Exploration Fund stated:“… Our next camp was at Khan Jubb Yusuf, where we arrived on the 4th of April. The Khan is a large building falling into ruins on the main road to Damascus. There was no village near, the country being occupied by Bedawin of the Semakiyeh and Zenghariyeh tribes.|$|R
50|$|In 1921 Arthur Szyk and {{his family}} moved to Paris where they stayed until 1933. The {{relocation}} to Paris is marked by a breakthrough in the formal aspect of Szyk's works. While Szyk's prior book illustrations were drawings in pen and ink (Szyk had illustrated six books before 1925, including three published in the Yiddish language), the illustrations for the books published in Paris were full colour and full of detail. The first book illustrated in this way was the Book of Esther (Le livre d'Esther, 1925), followed by Gustave Flaubert's dialogue The Temptation of Saint Anthony (La tentation de Saint Antoine, 1926), Pierre Benoît's novel Jacob's Well (Le <b>puits</b> <b>de</b> Jacob, 1927) and other books. Those illustrations, which are characterized by a rich diversity of colours and detailed presentation, deliberately referred to the medieval and renaissance traditions of illumination of manuscripts, often with interspersed contemporary elements. Szyk drew himself as one of the characters in the Book of Esther.. The only stylistic exception is illustrations to the two volume collection of humorous anecdotes about Jews Le juif qui rit (1926/27), in which the artist returned to simple black and white graphics. (Paradoxically, the book, one of the best known of his works, met with criticism as repeating antisemitic stereotypes.) The artist's reputation was also enhanced by exhibitions which were organized by Galeries Auguste Decour (the art gallery first exhibited Szyk's works in 1922). Szyk's drawings were purchased by the Minister of Education and Fine Arts Anatole de Monzie and the New York businessman Harry Glemby.|$|R
60|$|It {{was very}} well that my little tour was to termi- nate at Dijon; for I found, rather to my chagrin, {{that there was not}} a great deal, from the {{pictorial}} point of view, to be done with Dijon. It was no great matter, for I held my proposition to have been by this time abundantly demonstrated, - the proposition with which I started: that if Paris is France, France is by no means Paris. If Dijon was a good deal of a disap- pointment, I felt, therefore, that I could afford it. It {{was time for me to}} reflect, also, that for my disap- pointments, as a general thing, I had only myself to thank. They had too often been the consequence of arbitrary preconceptions, produced by influences of which I had lost the trace. At any rate, I will say plumply that the ancient capital of Burgundy is want- ing in character; it is not up to the mark. It is old and narrow and crooked, and it has been left pretty well to itself: but it is not high and overhanging; it is not, to the eye, what the Burgundian capital should be. It has some tortuous vistas, some mossy roofs, some bulging fronts, some gray-faced hotels, which look as if in former centuries - in the last, for instance, during the time of that delightful President de Brosses, whose Letters from Italy throw an interesting side-light on Dijon - they had witnessed a considerable amount of good living. But there is nothing else.

DEVELOPPEMENT D'UNE COMMANDE PAR LA TECHNIQUE DES MODES GLISSANTS ASSOCIEE A LA COMMANDE LINEARISANTE.

THIS WORKS DEALS WITH THE PROBLEM OF MODELLING AND NON LINEAR CONTROL OF ROTARY DRILLING SYSTEM IN ORDER TO MEET SOME SPECIFICATIONS. UP TO NOW, OIL ROTARY DRILLING SYSTEMS CONTROL IS ACHIEVED BY USING CLASSICAL REGULATORS PI OR PID. HOWEVER THE RELATED PERFORMANCE DRAMATICALLY DECREASES BY TORSIONAL VIBRATION CAUSED BY THE STICK-SLIP PHENOMENON, WHICH CAN PROVOKE ENORMOUSLY DESTRUCTIVE FLUCTUATING TORQUES IN THE DRILLSTRING AND INVARIABLY CAUSES DAMAGE TO THE BIT OR DRILLSTRING. SO THEN, AN ADEQUATE DESIGN CONTROLLER BECOMES NECESSARY IN ORDER TO REDUCE THIS DAMAGE AND TO BETTER MEET THE REQUIRED PERFORMANCE. THE EXISTING LINEAR CONTROL LAWS WHICH HAVE TREATED THE ROTARY SYSTEM ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY TO GUARANTEE THE STABILITY IN THE FACE OF SYSTEM UNCERTAINTIES. WE HAVE THEN PROPOSED A NONLINEAR MODEL WHICH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE WHOLE INFORMATION OF THE STICK-SLIP PHENOMENON, LEADING TO A GLOBAL DRILLING ROTARY MODEL REFLECTING THE REAL WORLD OIL PLATFORM SYSTEM. THEREFORE, WE FIRST SUGGEST TWO APPROACHES IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE: FEEDBACK LINEARIZATION DEVELOPMENT OF A SLIDING MODE CONTROLLER ASSOCIATED WITH AN INPUT STATE CONTROLLERHOWEVER, THE DRILLING SYSTEM IS KNOWN TO HAVE SOME UNCERTAINTIES IN DRILLSTRING, SO WE PROPOSE ONE NEW WAY BY A BACKSTEPPING BASED APPROACH ALLOWING TO FURTHER IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE AND ROBUSTNESS OF THE BIT. THE APPLICATION OF THESE THREE CONTROL STRATEGIES, THAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED, IS HEREIN APPEARING FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE OIL DOMAIN. THE OBTAINED RESULTS ARE SHOWN TO BE SATISFACTORY AND THE BACKSTEPPING CONTROLLER TURNS OUT TO OFFER THE SUPERIORITY IN TERMS OF, ROBUSTNESS WITH RESPECT TO PARAMETRICAL UNCERTAINTIES.
