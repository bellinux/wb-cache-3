5|$|Although {{earmarked}} for operations against the Soviet Union, Luftflotte 2 {{remained in the}} west until May 1941. This was <b>partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> deception measure, and partly because new airbases in Poland could not be completed by 1 June 1941 target date, although they were made ready {{in time for the}} actual commencement of Operation Barbarossa on 22 June 1941. Kesselring established his new headquarters at Bielany, a suburb of Warsaw.|$|E
5|$|He {{developed}} a reputation for honesty, diligence {{and the ability to}} testify effectively before legislative hearings and to speak clearly to the press. In 1936, he cofounded the American Labor Party, a pro-union political party active in New York, along with David Dubinsky and Sidney Hillman, <b>partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> vehicle to organize support for the re-election that year of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and mayor Fiorello La Guardia among socialists in the union movement.|$|E
5|$|Initially most Luftwaffe fighter wings {{consisted}} of three groups (Gruppe), which were the equivalent of USAAF groups or RAF Wings. Groups were identified using Roman numerals, followed by the unit number; e.g. I./JG 1. In 1942 JG 1 was the first unit to be expanded to incorporate a fourth group. <b>Partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of JG 1's expansion, other Luftwaffe fighter wings incorporated a fourth group from mid-1943.|$|E
50|$|Harding's {{literary}} {{significance is}} <b>partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> introducer of foreign modernism, especially French, American and British poetry, into Swedish literature.|$|R

50|$|The state {{encouraged}} {{women to}} take {{a more active role in}} the paid labour force and in social life, <b>partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> attempt to undermine Church attitudes about a woman's role in family life.|$|R
5|$|The 1926 tour of England {{would be}} Collins's last. <b>Partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{result of a}} wet English summer, the first four Tests of the five-Test series ended in draws. Collins had a disappointing tour, {{suffering}} from neuritis and in constant pain from arthritis. He missed the Third and Fourth Tests when admitted to hospital but recovered to resume his place as captain for the Fifth Test.|$|E
5|$|The League also {{succeeded in}} {{reducing}} the death rate of workers constructing the Tanganyika railway from 55 to 4 percent. Records were kept to control slavery, prostitution, and the trafficking of women and children. <b>Partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of pressure brought by the League of Nations, Afghanistan abolished slavery in 1923, Iraq in 1924, Nepal in 1926, Transjordan and Persia in 1929, Bahrain in 1937, and Ethiopia in 1942.|$|E
5|$|The lyrics' {{reference}} {{to an extreme}} length of time is accentuated by the stretching out of an already slow 6/8 metre into 9/8, and, during the verses, by the appending of a measure-long instrumental tag after each two bars of vocal melody. <b>Partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result {{of the absence of}} resolution in the home key, the descending bassline in the verses – a 4-3-2-1 sequence of notes mirroring the IV-iii-ii-I chord pattern – establishes an almost subliminal tonic.|$|E
60|$|After a time, however, {{she lost}} this {{influence}} entirely. Her disputes with Philip ended at length {{in a bitter}} and implacable quarrel. Philip married another woman, named Cleopatra, <b>partly,</b> indeed, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> measure of political alliance, and <b>partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> act of hostility and hatred against Olympias, whom he accused of the most disgraceful crimes. Olympias went home to Epirus in a rage, and sought refuge {{in the court of}} her brother.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The ruinous {{remains of}} the Cistercian abbey of Dundrennan, perhaps founded or co-founded by Fergus. It is {{possible}} that monastery was founded <b>partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> act of penitence for Gallovidian atrocities committed in 1138 during the Scottish Crown's invasion of northern England.|$|R
25|$|The {{property}} is {{listed on the}} National Register of Historic Places as New Haven Railroad Station. Its significance is <b>partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> example {{of the work of}} Cass Gilbert, who also designed the Woolworth Building in New York and the U.S. Supreme Court Building.|$|R
5|$|Underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis may be problems. The {{cost and}} {{difficulty}} of screening and assessment can delay diagnosis. Conversely, the increasing popularity of drug treatment options {{and the expansion}} of benefits has motivated providers to overdiagnose ASD. There are indications AS has been diagnosed more frequently in recent years, <b>partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> residual diagnosis for children of normal intelligence who are not autistic but have social difficulties.|$|E
5|$|Urse's estates grew under William II, <b>partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{result of}} the {{inheritance}} {{of some of the}} lands of his brother, Robert Despenser, who died about 1097. Later, Urse consolidated his holdings by exchanging some of Robert's lands in Lincolnshire with Robert de Lacy for lands closer to his base in Worcestershire. Urse d'Abetot gained and passed to his heirs an estate that later became the Barony of Salwarpe, Worcestershire.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{has had a}} {{significant}} African American population since the city's foundation. African American residents composed about 30% of the District's total population between 1800 and 1940. The black population reached a peak of 70% by 1970, but has since steadily declined due to many African Americans moving to the surrounding suburbs. <b>Partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of gentrification, there was a 31.4% increase in the non-Hispanic white population and an 11.5% decrease in the black population between 2000 and 2010.|$|E
50|$|In 1890 Wanamaker persuaded Congress {{to pass an}} act {{prohibiting the}} sale of lottery tickets through the mail, and then he aggressively pursued violators. Those actions {{effectively}} ended all state lotteries in the US until they reappeared in 1964, <b>partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> effort to undermine organized crime.|$|R
50|$|Springhill was {{selected}} as the site for the medium security prison for Atlantic Canada during the early 1960s, <b>partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> economic diversification strategy following the closure of the town's largest employer, a coal mine that was permanently shut in 1958 following the Springhill Mining Disaster.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> {{outgrowth}} of the USBIG Networks conference, a bill for a modest basic income was introduced into the U.S. House of Representatives under the name [...] "the Tax Cut for the Rest of Us Act," [...] based on a proposal coauthored by Al Sheahen.|$|R
5|$|After the Civil War, Oxford Castle served {{primarily}} {{as the local}} prison. As with other prisons at the time, the owners, in this case Christ Church College, leased the castle to wardens who would profit by charging prisoners for their board and lodging. The prison also had a gallows to execute prisoners, such as Mary Blandy in 1752. For most of the 18th century, the castle prison was run by the local Etty and Wisdom families and was in increasing disrepair. In the 1770s the prison reformer John Howard visited the castle several times, and criticised its size and quality, including {{the extent to which}} vermin infested the prison. <b>Partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of this criticism, it was decided by the County authorities to rebuild the Oxford Prison.|$|E
5|$|Despite initial {{skepticism}} in the West, the new Soviet leader {{proved to}} be committed to reversing the Soviet Union's deteriorating economic condition instead of continuing the arms race with the West. <b>Partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> way to fight off internal opposition from party cliques to his reforms, Gorbachev simultaneously introduced glasnost, or openness, which increased freedom of the press and the transparency of state institutions. Glasnost was intended to reduce the corruption {{at the top of the}} Communist Party and moderate the abuse of power in the Central Committee. Glasnost also enabled increased contact between Soviet citizens and the western world, particularly with the United States, contributing to the accelerating détente between the two nations.|$|E
5|$|Having already {{gained some}} {{coaching}} experience in China, Gascoigne signed for Boston United on 30 July 2004. After {{being at the}} club for 11 games he left (<b>partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of the club refusing to let him participate in the reality television show I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!) on 5 October, to begin a football coaching course. After leaving Boston, he stated that {{he was interested in}} taking over as manager of Scottish side Greenock Morton, but this came to nothing.|$|E
50|$|He started The Hotline, a daily {{political}} newsletter {{delivered by}} fax, in 1987. It began <b>partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> experiment in bipartisanship. Each issue, faxed {{in the late}} morning, included a roundup of political jokes from the previous night’s talk-show monologues. He sold it to the National Journal in 1996.|$|R
50|$|The state {{encouraged}} {{the migration from}} rural areas towards cities, <b>partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> attempt to weaken the Church's influence. School curricula was modified to include more Marxist-Leninist ideas, new superintendents sympathetic to the party were appointed and later afternoon classes were created to hinder children from going to receive religious instruction.|$|R

Caption: "The Army, {{concerned}} with a declining number of junior officers from minority groups, ahs launched an officer procurement program in an effort to attract more blacks, Indians ad Mexican-Americans to its ranks - <b>partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> effort to defuse racial tensions. ...|$|R
5|$|In late 1859 Pretorius {{was invited}} to stand for President in the Orange Free State, where many burghers now favoured union, <b>partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> means to {{overcome}} the Basotho. The Transvaal constitution he had just enacted made it illegal to simultaneously hold office abroad, but nevertheless he readily did so and won. The Transvaal volksraad attempted to side-step the constitutional problems surrounding this by granting Pretorius half a year's leave, hoping a solution might come about during this time, and the President duly left for Bloemfontein, appointing Johannes Hermanus Grobler to be Acting President in his absence. Pretorius {{was sworn in as}} President of the Free State on 8 February 1860; he sent a deputation to Pretoria to negotiate union the next day.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-twentieth century, {{there were}} {{divisions}} in the Melbourne art scene, which became intertwined with the complex cultural politics of the Cold War era. In the late 1940s, there was a move against modernism in art, and tonalism came into favour. <b>Partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> reaction to this development, artist George Bell established an exhibiting group called the Melbourne Contemporary Artists in 1940. Bell was a former war artist and influential member of the Victorian artistic establishment, who after World War II was appointed to teach at the National Gallery of Victoria's painting school. Influenced by Bell, Stokes was among the artists for whom modernism was a strong influence, and who exhibited with the Melbourne Contemporary Artists. Other {{members of the group}} included Russell Drysdale and Sali Herman.|$|E
5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1970, <b>partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{response}} to criticism {{that they were not}} reaching their intended audience, the CTW conducted a poll of four urban neighborhoods in New York, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. The results of the poll were positive in three out of the four neighborhoods and confirmed the show's high viewership. Sesame Street's high ratings increased during its second season, and Nielsen reported high audience loyalty. Gerald S. Lesser, CTW's first advisory board chair, reported rumors about the show becoming a fad among college students. Its ratings steadily increased for the first five seasons, and Nielsen reported that Sesame Street had the highest ratings of any PBS program. In 1985, the Workshop estimated that 20% of its regular viewers consisted of adults.|$|E

50|$|Nippon Yusen Kaisha and Nippon Oil {{developed}} the Auriga Leader <b>partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> experimental vessel, {{where it is}} supposed to gather statistical research in how solar power can assist in powering a ship at sea. The ship's experimental stage has been planned for two years, and has as of September 8, 2009 completed 7 months of that period.|$|R
5|$|Marshall died {{of heart}} failure {{at the age of}} 38 in 1939. Twenty-five years later, <b>partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of his efforts, The Wilderness Society helped gain passage of the Wilderness Act. The Act was passed by Congress in 1964 and legally defined {{wilderness}} areas of the United States and protected some nine million acres (36,000km2) of federal land. Today, Marshall is considered largely responsible for the wilderness preservation movement. Several areas and landmarks, including The Bob Marshall Wilderness in Montana and Mount Marshall in the Adirondacks, have been named in his honor.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the work}} of the Scottish Parliament is done in committee. The role of {{committees}} is stronger in the Scottish Parliament than in other parliamentary systems, <b>partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> means of strengthening the role of backbenchers in their scrutiny of the government and partly to compensate for {{the fact that there is}} no revising chamber. The principal role of committees in the Scottish Parliament is to take evidence from witnesses, conduct inquiries and scrutinise legislation. Committee meetings take place on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morning when Parliament is sitting. Committees can also meet at other locations throughout Scotland.|$|E
5|$|<b>Partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{result of}} Marshall's attacks on {{prominent}} Democratic-Republicans such as Governor Shelby, the Federalists gained {{influence in the}} state legislature. The Federalist cause was also bolstered by the quashing of the Whiskey Rebellion by federal forces in 1794, and the federal victory over the Northwest Indians at the Battle of Fallen Timbers on August 20, 1794. Later that year, the Federalists in the General Assembly nominated Marshall for the United States Senate. On the first ballot, Marshall garnered 18 votes, compared with 16 for Democratic-Republican John Breckinridge, 8 for John Fowler, and 7 for incumbent John Edwards. On the runoff ballot that followed, Marshall defeated Breckinridge {{by a vote of}} 2822.|$|E
50|$|Parker was {{an admirer}} of the American parkways, notably those in Westchester County, hence the {{prominence}} given to Princess Parkway in the Wythenshawe plan. His Presidential Address to the Town Planning Institute in 1929 shows his desire to create parkways in Britain, <b>partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> answer {{to the problem of}} ribbon development on newly built main roads.|$|R
50|$|Mackinnon is {{described}} in {{the records of the}} Synod of Argyll as “a man able in the Gaelic language”. In October 1651, the Synod appointed him “twelve bolls victual out of the vacancies of Kintyre”, <b>partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> acknowledgment of his work in translating the Shorter Catechism into Gaelic, and partly on account of “his great necessitie and penurie”.|$|R
50|$|Support for {{bicameralism}} is {{not completely}} absent, however, {{and there have been}} occasional proposals for a new upper house or Senate. A constitutional reform committee chaired by Ronald Algie proposed an appointed Senate in 1952. In 1990, the government of Jim Bolger proposed an elected Senate, <b>an</b> idea advanced <b>partly</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> alternative to New Zealand's electoral reform process.|$|R
