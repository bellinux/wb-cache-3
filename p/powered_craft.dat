2500|$|Some {{accounts}} {{record that}} the creature {{appeared to have}} [...] "no visible arms" [...] due to its incredible speed, while others reported long, stringy arms, protruding {{from the front of}} its body, with long, claw-like fingers. The creature {{is referred to as the}} [...] "Lizard Monster" [...] on the March 10, 2010, episode of MonsterQuest. Some witnesses reported seeing a large, pulsating red ball of light that hovered above or rested on the ground. Ufologists believe that it may have been a <b>powered</b> <b>craft</b> that the entity had piloted.|$|E

50|$|Planing Plank - a narrow, {{flat bottom}} keel about 150mm wide {{on a high}} speed deep or medium V <b>powered</b> {{planning}} <b>craft.</b> In flat water the craft would plane on this narrow plank giving increased speed. In choppy water the ride was unsettled. Steering accuracy when cornering was difficult as the craft swung wide. A concept used in <b>power</b> <b>craft</b> in the 1970s and 1980s but replaced by deeper V hulls with angles of more than 21 degrees from the 1990s.|$|R
25|$|Model yachts are {{operating}} craft, {{which may be}} sail, steam, engine or electric motor powered, typically resembling pleasure <b>power</b> <b>craft,</b> although the hobby also includes the construction and operation of models of working ships such as tugboats and other craft shown {{in this article as}} static models.|$|R

50|$|His design {{portfolio}} is wide-ranging, from record-breaking yachts to innovative cruising designs such as Roxane, and other sailing designs of traditional appearance {{such as the}} Westernman cutters - designed in association with Ed Burnett - or the launch Rangeboat, a 12m <b>power</b> <b>craft</b> also of traditional appearance. Typically, Irens' designs synthesise traditional forms with modern materials and methods of construction, with Carbon fibre masts, laminated frames, and epoxied strip wood strongly in evidence.|$|R
50|$|Archibald Logan, who {{was then}} living in Stanley Point Road, Devonport, with a boatshed on Ngataringa Bay {{continued}} to build boats, but {{at a slower pace}} and increasingly began concentrating on the design side. He designed and built the champion shallow-drafted mullet boats, and after the First World War designed many keel yachts, centreboard craft (in particular the 18-foot Patiki M class) and <b>power</b> <b>craft.</b> By 1930 Logan was mostly occupied in yacht designing.|$|R

40|$|A recent {{anisotropy}} {{experiment with}} a 30 -arcmin beam {{is close to}} optimal for testing models in which cosmic structure arose from inflation-generated Gaussian density perturbations. Using a Bayesian analysis to constrain the amplitude of the perturbation spectrum, it is shown that adiabatic hot-dark-matter models are convincingly ruled out and cold-dark-matter models have anisotropies near the derived limits. Theories with broken scale invariance such as isocurvature baryon models are strongly constrained, as are models with extra <b>power</b> <b>crafted</b> to give significant large-scale structures and flows...|$|R

40|$|Used {{for centuries}} as a {{decorative}} artefact, amber was treasured, too, for its perceived magical <b>powers,</b> <b>crafted</b> into charms and amulets to heal and ward off evil spirits. Amber {{also has the}} unique capacity to preserve fragile life that is millions of years old, opening a special window into the past. This is {{the book of the}} exhibition held at the National Museum of Scotland 10 May- 8 September 2013. It brings together, for the first time, the highlights of National Museums Scotland's fine collection plus loans from the V&A, Abbotsford Trust, Natural History Museum, NBC Universal and Sir David Attenborough, revealing the origins, properties and uses of this precious substance. ...|$|R

50|$|In Australasia surf lifesaving clubs operate {{inflatable}} {{rescue boats}} (IRB) for in-shore rescues of swimmers and surfers. These boats are best typified by the rubber Zodiac and are {{powered by a}} 25-horsepower outboard motor. In the off season, these boats are used in competitive rescue racing.In addition to this, most states have a <b>power</b> <b>craft</b> rescue service. RWCs (Rescue Water Craft, Jetski) are common to many beaches, providing lifesaving service. The state of New South Wales operates dual hull fiberglass offshore boats, while Queensland, Tasmania and South Australia operate aluminum hull Jet Rescue Boats, of about 6m in length. Some regions such as North Queensland and the Northern Territory operate RNLI style rigid hull inflatables.|$|R

The lower harbor was {{completed}} first and provides slips up to 60', and is itself split into an east and a west side. The west lower harbor contains docks AA, A-F, & FF; sailboat dry storage and hoist launch; a hand launch ramp for small, lightweight craft; a small Coast Guard facility; and is adjacent to the Santa Cruz Yacht Club. It hosts a mixture of sail and <b>power</b> <b>craft,</b> and is the location {{for most of the}} harbor's slips over 40 feet it is accessed off of Seabright and Atlantic avenues.|$|R
50|$|There is {{controversy}} {{regarding the}} environmental benefits of the speed limitation. When <b>powered</b> <b>craft</b> plane, at around 20 mph, they produce less of a wake. This has led opponents of the speed limit to argue that by limiting powerboats to 10 knots more damage is being done per powerboat.|$|E

40|$|The {{current state}} of the marine {{industry}} is seeing many small production companies being forced into closure from severe lack custom. The decline in new boat purchase is not however reflected in the coastal leisure participation figures with recent studies still seeing increases in many areas. This indicates that there is still a demand for leisure craft, but the options available are not appropriate for a market where disposable income is not as readily available. Other options available to those still wishing to pursue their hobbies are to purchase a second hand vessel and hope to save {{as a result of the}} vessels deterioration, or to take on the daunting task a complicated home build project. This project offers an alternative to all these options, supplying potential customers with brand new inshore <b>power</b> <b>craft</b> capable of being adapted to a wider range of activities and at a fraction of the price. The project involves selecting an existing <b>power</b> <b>craft</b> and updating it to provide a simple kit boat to the market. The project will investigate the use of innovative new building techniques in an attempt to produce a vessel that is simple to produce and requires little or no boatbuilding experience. New production techniques such as CNC cutting and nesting will be researched in order to reduce wastage and overall cost, and modern materials that have been rarely used by amateurs in the past will be used to produce a light, durable structure. The final design will also be assessed for suitability and to ensure that the vessel and idea as a whole is in fact a viable investment and if this niche market can be exploited...|$|R

40|$|Throughout the Twentieth Century, legislatures at {{all levels}} of American {{government}} have sought admirably to protect workers from a host of economic and societal ills by enacting broad-based remedial legislation. At times, these same legislatures have abdicated responsibility to the executive bureaucracy for further regulatory development. Without ensuring the attendant transfer of political accountability commensurate with the authority of the regulatory state, the delicate balance of <b>powers</b> <b>crafted</b> by the founders becomes skewed. Armed with the combined might of legislative fiat and unfettered enforcement power, the heavy hand of an over-zealous executive bureaucracy extends itself beyond the bounds initially established by the legislature in what is known as “mission creep. ” And, in the modern economy, the ramifications of mission creep are global...|$|R
