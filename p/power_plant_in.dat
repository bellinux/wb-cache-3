40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the analysis and}} evaluation of biogas <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> capacity <b>in</b> Poland based on the generic structure and energy production. These issues are also presented {{from the point of}} view of the obtained energy and biogas energy production in Poland against selected European Union countries. The paper also indicates a significant diversity in the spatial distribution of biogas <b>plants</b> <b>in</b> Poland. It also discusses the importance of biogas plants as one of the elements of bottom-up development of the second tier administrative units. There are 231 biogas <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> <b>in</b> Poland (as of 2013), which are based on biogas from landfill sites, biogas from wastewater treatment plants, and agricultural biogas. The generic structure of biogas <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> <b>in</b> Poland is dominated by <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> based on biogas from landfill. Despite the fact that Poland has large resources of agricultural substrate, there are very few biogas <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> based on agricultural biogas. There are no biogas <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> <b>in</b> almost 60 % of poviats in Poland, despite the fact that every poviat in Poland has enough of this substrate at its disposal. This article contributes innovative elements to existing knowledge on biogas <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> <b>in</b> Poland, thanks to its comprehensive treatment of the problem of biogas <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> <b>in</b> Poland and because it urges local authorities and local communities to behave more ecologically, as well as promoting endogenous factors of the economic development of a given region...|$|R

5|$|A 2013 {{study by}} the National Renewable Energy Laboratory {{concluded}} that the average large photovoltaic plant in the United States occupied 3.1 acres of permanently disturbed area and 3.4 acres of total site area per gigawatt-hour per year. The average concentrated solar <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> <b>in</b> the US occupied 2.7 acres of disturbed area and 3.5 acres of total area per GWh/yr, A 2015 life-cycle analysis of land use for various sources of electricity concluded that concentrating solar power had a land-use footprint of 9.0 m2/MWhr for trough, and 14 m2/MWhr for power tower. The concentrating solar footprint was smaller than that of coal power (18 m2/MWhr), but larger than the other sources studied, including ground photovoltaic (7.9 m2/MWhr), natural gas (0.49 m2/MWhr), and wind power (0.26 m2/MWhr).|$|E
5|$|A {{site was}} first {{identified}} for the <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> <b>in</b> the 1970s when a study {{was carried out}} on the water resources of the Albors Mountains by the Belgian firm Traksionel. Several sites for dams were identified including Siah Bisheh as a potential place for a pumped-storage <b>power</b> <b>plant.</b> <b>In</b> 1975, a feasibility report on the Siah Bisheh project was submitted to the Ministry of Energy. The Albors Mountains study concluded in 1977 and geologic studies began in 1978 but were halted in 1979 due to the Iranian Revolution. In 1983, Lahmeyer International was contracted to create designs for Phase II (underground excavation) which were completed in 1985, the same year construction on the dam's diversion tunnels began. Further designs for Phase I (superstructures) were developed and construction continued until 1992 when a lack of funding halted the project once again. Construction would not commence again until 2001. In 2002 and 2003, contracts for the dams and power plant were awarded and construction continued. The project was 90 percent complete as of April 2012. Both the upper and lower reservoir were complete and had finished impounding in January 2013. The first of four generators was commissioned in May 2013 and the remaining were operational by 1 September 2015.|$|E
