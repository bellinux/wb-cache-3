5|$|In addition, in at-risk pregnancies {{due to an}} {{affected}} male partner, non-invasive <b>prenatal</b> <b>diagnosis</b> can {{be performed}} by analyzing cell-free fetal DNA in a blood sample taken from the mother (via venipuncture) between six and twelve weeks of pregnancy. It has no procedure-related risk of miscarriage (excepting via needle contamination).|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to obtain a <b>prenatal</b> <b>diagnosis</b> for an embryo or fetus in the womb, using fetal genetic material acquired through chorionic villus sampling. An amniocentesis can be performed if the pregnancy is further along, within 14–18 weeks. This procedure looks at the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby for indicators of the HD mutation. This, too, can be paired with exclusion testing to avoid disclosure of parental genotype. Prenatal testing can be done when a parent has been diagnosed with HD, when they have had genetic testing showing {{the expansion of the}} HTT gene, or when they have a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. The parents can be counseled on their options, which include termination of pregnancy, and on the difficulties of a child with the identified gene.|$|E
25|$|<b>Prenatal</b> <b>diagnosis.</b> If {{both parents}} are {{identified}} as carriers, prenatal genetic testing can determine whether the fetus has inherited a defective gene copy from both parents. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS), {{the most common form}} of <b>prenatal</b> <b>diagnosis,</b> can be performed between 10 and 14 weeks of gestation. Amniocentesis is usually performed at 15–18 weeks. These procedures have risks of miscarriage of 1% or less.|$|E

40|$|Of {{feminism}} and disability theory's many overlapping concerns, few have received {{as much attention}} as <b>prenatal</b> genetic <b>diagnosis</b> and selective abortion. While the attention to how genetic selection reinforces disability stigma is important, much of this writing has failed to present the feminist case for the right to unrestricted abortion. This oversight has led to an articulation of the disability critique of selective abortion that threatens the very claims to reproductive freedom and bodily self-determination that undergird disability politics as well. This article rearticulates the feminist case for unrestricted reproductive rights in order to challenge the current framing of <b>prenatal</b> genetic <b>diagnosis</b> as an ethical failure and to present the opportunity to refigure reproductive rights as disability rights...|$|R
25|$|A {{more recent}} {{application}} of PGD is to diagnose late-onset diseases and (cancer) predisposition syndromes. Since affected individuals remain healthy until {{the onset of}} the disease, frequently in the fourth decade of life, there is debate on whether or not PGD is appropriate in these cases. Considerations include the high probability of developing the disorders and the potential for cures. For example, in predisposition syndromes, such as BRCA mutations which predispose the individual to breast cancer, the outcomes are unclear. Although PGD is often regarded as an early form of <b>prenatal</b> <b>diagnosis,</b> the nature of the requests for PGD often differs from those of <b>prenatal</b> <b>diagnosis</b> requests made when the mother is already pregnant. Some of the widely accepted indications for PGD would not be acceptable for <b>prenatal</b> <b>diagnosis.</b>|$|E

25|$|Cytogenetics {{involves}} using {{blood and}} other cells {{to get a}} karyotype. This {{can be helpful in}} <b>prenatal</b> <b>diagnosis</b> (e.g. Down's syndrome) as well as in cancer (some cancers have abnormal chromosomes).|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{rarity of}} the syndrome, {{it is not}} {{routinely}} screened before birth. <b>Prenatal</b> <b>diagnosis</b> is possible in families in which a prior child has been diagnosed, because the responsible gene CTC1is known.|$|E
25|$|Cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) is fetal DNA {{circulating}} {{freely in}} the maternal blood stream. It can be sampled by venipuncture on the mother. Analysis of cffDNA provides {{a method of}} non-invasive <b>prenatal</b> <b>diagnosis</b> and testing.|$|E
50|$|Several {{new studies}} {{have started to}} address this issue.

40|$|The current morphologically based {{selection}} of human embryos for transfer cannot detect chromosome aneuploidies. So far, only biopsy techniques {{have been able}} to screen for chromosomal aneuploidies in the in vitro fertilization (IVF) embryos. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) or screening (PGS) involves the biopsy of oocyte polar bodies or embryonic cells and has become a routine clinical procedure in many IVF clinics worldwide, including recent development of comprehensive chromosome screening of all 23 pairs of chromosomes by microarrays for aneuploidy screening. The routine preimplantation and <b>prenatal</b> genetic <b>diagnosis</b> (PND) require testing in an aggressive manner. These procedures may be invasive to the growing embryo and fetus and potentially could compromise the clinical outcome. Therefore the aim of this review is to summarize not only the new knowledge on preimplantation and <b>prenatal</b> genetic <b>diagnosis</b> in humans, but also on the development of potential noninvasive embryo and fetal testing that might {{play an important role in}} the future...|$|R

25|$|Carrier {{testing for}} Roberts {{syndrome}} requires prior {{identification of the}} disease-causing mutation in the family. Carriers for the disorder are heterozygotes due to the autosomal recessive nature of the disease. Carriers are also not at risk for contracting Roberts syndrome themselves.

25|$|Complete {{tetraploidy}} is {{more rarely}} diagnosed than triploidy, but is observed in 1–2% of early miscarriages.

40|$|Female {{foeticide}} besides skewed {{sex ratio}} {{and its attendant}} social evils has grave ethical undertones, especially for medical professionals and our commitment to save lives. Randomly selected 270 women were interviewed using a semi-structured interview schedule to explore the female foeticide perceptions and practices among couples in Surat city. Only 148 (51. 9 %) {{of the women were}} {{aware of the fact that}} 3 female children killed every minute in India. Prenatal sex determination among their relatives and neighbours were reported by 80 % respondent, though they themselves had never resorted to it. Could this figure influence the proxy rates for community behaviour, perhaps, this needs indepth exploration. Supporting to this fact, 25. 9 % respoindents reported of ever been pressurized by their family members to undergo <b>prenatal</b> sex <b>diagnosis</b> of their foetus. Encouragingly 90 % respondents had opined that that repeated <b>prenatal</b> sex <b>diagnosis</b> and abortions are detrimental to the mental and physical health of a woman and is wholly preventable.

25|$|Triple X {{syndrome}} can {{be diagnosed}} prenatally through amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. In Denmark, between 1970 and 1984, 76% of the prenatally diagnosed fetuses with triple-X were aborted. Between 1985-1987, this figure dropped to 56%. With improved information, {{the number of}} abortions diminished. In the Netherlands, between 1991 and 2000, 33% (18/54) of the couples that were confronted with a <b>prenatal</b> <b>diagnosis</b> of 47, XXX elected to abort. If balanced information is provided to prospective parents, prenatally, the incidence of voluntary termination (abortion) is reduced.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the wide}} variety of {{mutations}} leading to TSC, no simple genetic tests are available to identify new cases, nor are any biochemical markers known for the gene defects. However, once a person has been clinically diagnosed, the genetic mutation can usually be found. The search is time-consuming and has a 15% failure rate, which is thought to be due to somatic mosaicism. If successful, this information can be used to identify affected family members, including <b>prenatal</b> <b>diagnosis.</b> , preimplantation diagnosis is not widely available.|$|E
25|$|Amniocentesis and {{chorionic}} villus sampling are procedures conducted {{to assess the}} fetus. A sample of amniotic fluid is obtained by the insertion of a needle through the abdomen and into the uterus. Chorionic villus sampling is a similar procedure {{with a sample of}} tissue removed rather than fluid. These procedures are not associated with pregnancy loss during the second trimester but they are associated with miscarriages and birth defects in the first trimester. Miscarriage caused by invasive <b>prenatal</b> <b>diagnosis</b> ({{chorionic villus}} sampling (CVS) and amniocentesis) is rare (about 1%).|$|E
