This molecular cluster formulated [Cu 4 I 4 (PPh 3) 4]· 2 CHCl 3 (1) exhibits a highly contrasted emission response to manual grinding, and, interestingly, the optical properties of the ground phase present striking similarities with those of the cubane isomer.

In this study, a new <b>pseudopolymorph</b> of cobalt (II) meso-tetraphenylporphyrin, (CoTPP), was synthesized in a known one-pot reaction, rather than using many-step conventional methods, was isolated and was characterized {{for the first time}} by low-temperature single crystal X-ray diffraction. It is a nonstoichiometric solvate assembled into dichloromethane channels. The most striking feature of this structure is the conformation adopted by the porphyrin macrocycle. In contrast to the non-solvated form of CoTPP that exhibits a ruffled core distortion and crystallizes in the tetragonal space group I- 42 d, this solvated form has been crystallized in the triclinic space group Pī and shows a distinct saddle-shaped macrocycle distortion. In the triclinic form, the conformation of one of the four phenyl rings is remarkably different from the others. A potential energy surface scan of the torsional angles around the bonds between this phenyl moiety and the macrocycle of CoTPP in both the non-solvated and the solvate forms demonstrates that the saddle-shaped macrocycle distortion depends on the unusual phenyl conformation. The distortion is responsible for the symmetry decrease in the channel solvate form, causing a loss of the 4 -fold rotoinversion axis observed in the non-solvated tetragonal phase, which has identical phenyl conformations.

40|$|Incorporation {{of water}} {{molecules}} in the crystal structure of an organic compound has strong effects on its {{physical and chemical}} properties. Therefore, the study on stability of water-incorporated pharmaceutical compounds and mechanisms of hydration and dehydration {{is very important for}} the pharmaceutical industries. The main goals of the present research project were quantitative description of the crystallization and solid-state transformations of pseudopolymorphs of sodium naproxen in order to provide fundamental information concerning stability of the pseudopolymorphic forms. Furthermore, macroscopic phenomena of size reduction and anisotropic water-removal by dehydration were rationalized by microscopic aspects of crystal lattice structures. The heats of solution for each <b>pseudopolymorph</b> were estimated by fitting the solubility data with the vant Hoff equation, and their use was extended by the thermodynamic cycle developed in the present study. According to the thermodynamic cycle, for an enantiotropic system, a form with a lower degree of hydration always has the lower heat of solution than a form with a higher degree of hydration, implying that a form with a lower degree of hydration is more stable. The relative stabilities of the dihydrated, the monohydrated, and the anhydrous sodium naproxen at 0 % relative humidity were investigated by dehydration of the dihydrated form and powder X-ray diffraction. The monohydrate is more stable than the dihydrate and the result was supported by isothermal TGA experiments. This research explained why powder-like crystals of the anhydrous sodium naproxen were produced by dehydration of hydrated forms. The surfaces of the dehydrated crystals displayed cracks aligned along the b-axis of the monohydrate. These cracks made the anhydrous crystals, which were produced from the monohydrated species, very brittle and, eventually, such crystals were disrupted into much smaller entities. In addition, the existence of water channels in the unit cells of the monohydrate facilitates the dehydration in a direction more rapidly, especially, along the b-axis of the monohydrate. Rapid removal of water in a specific direction caused anisotropic dehydration. Ph. D.

40|$|The {{research}} {{addressed in}} this thesis focuses on monitoring and characterization of pharmaceutical compounds by laser backscattering. In particular, this study covers two topics: (1) the determination of naproxen sodium solubility in water, and its phase transition; and (2) comparisons of batch and laminar flow tubular crystallizers {{for the production of}} paracetamol (acetaminophen) and D-mannitol. Using a Lasentec™ Focused Beam Reflectance Measurement (FBRM) device, the solubility of naproxen sodium in aqueous solutions was determined over a temperature range from 15. 2 to 39. 7 ℃ With the determination of the solubilities of two <b>pseudopolymorphs,</b> anhydrous and dihydrated naproxen sodium, the phase transition point between these two forms of the pharmaceutical compound was determined to occur at 30. 3 ℃ Enthalpy of solution and metastable zone widths were also determined for the experimental conditions. Crystallizations of paracetamol and D-mannitol were performed in a batch crystallizer and in a laminar flow tubular crystallizer (LFTC) system. In the latter system, supersaturation was generated rapidly in the solution being transported through a temperature-controlled tube and recovered in a batch vessel where product crystals were grown to equilibration. Because of the rapid rate at which supersaturation was generated in the LFTC, the resulting crystals were of smaller mean size than those obtained from batch crystallizations. The total time required for crystallization was significantly less with the LFTC than with the batch unit. Additionally, the rapid cooling in the LFTC {{led to the formation of}} two different polymorphs of paracetamol, Forms I and II. M. S. Committee Chair: Ronald W. Rousseau; Committee Member: Angus P.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007. Objective: Stavudine is a {{nucleoside}} {{reverse transcriptase}} inhibitor (NRTI) {{that is used}} in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. Stavudine exhibits polymorphism and various polymorphic forms of stavudine are described in the literature, however the available information on these solid states, at the start and during this study, was limited. This study was conducted in order to (1) generate supplementary and/or possibly new information on the physicochemical properties of the various polymorphs of stavudine, (2) to possibly prepare and characterise a new polymorphic form of stavudine, (3) to determine and compare the dissolution behaviour of the stavudine polymorphs and (4) to investigate the possibility of applying analytical techniques to quantify the stavudine polymorphs in solid state mixtures. Methods: Various characterisation methods were used to determine the physicochemical properties of the polymorphic forms of stavudine, including X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD); variable temperature X-ray powder diffraction (VT-XRPD); diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS); differential scanning calorimetry (DSC); thermogravimetric analysis (TGA); polarising optical microscopy; hot-stage microscopy (HSM); scanning electron microscopy (SEM); as well as Karl Fischer (KF) analysis. The dissolution behaviour of the various polymorphic forms of stavudine, that were prepared during this study, was also determined, whilst quantitative XRPD and DRIFTS methods were developed for the quantitative study. Results: Polymorphic form I and form II of stavudine were prepared by recrystallisation of stavudine raw material from various solvents, whereas form Ill (hydrate) and the N-methyl- 2 -pyrrolidone (NMP) solvate of stavudine were recrystallised from water and NMP respectively. The results generated from the VT-XRPD analyses of form I and form II demonstrated that these solid states are monotropically related (supportive of the findings of Mirmehrabi et al. (2006 : 141)), and that form I and II do not interconvert to one another. The hydrate of stavudine was not observed to convert to polymorphic form I upon heating, as was determined by Gandhi et al. (2000 : 228). However, VT-XRPD analysis of form Ill and the NMP solvate showed that upon heating, both these <b>pseudopolymorphs</b> interconvert to form a polymorphic mixture consisting of form I and II. A glassy (amorphous) form of stavudine that was previously not described in the available literature was also prepared and characterised during this study. Dissolution testing of polymorphic form I, form II, the glassy (amorphous) stavudine and the form 1 / 11 mixture of stavudine revealed that a greater amount of the glassy stavudine dissolved within one minute compared to the other polymorphic forms. A comparison of the dissolution profiles, based on the requirements of the Medicines Control Council of South Africa, indicated that the profiles of form I and form II, form I and the glassy stavudine, and form I and the form 1 / 11 mixture are similar. Two different methods (based on the analytical techniques of XRPD and DRIFTS) were developed to quantify the amount of form I and form II of stavudine in solid state mixtures. Each method was validated, and the results indicated that the quantitative DRIFTS method showed the greatest agreement between the experimental and theoretical polymorphic content. Preferred orientation was assumed to be the reason for the deviation of the quantitative XRPD results, and it was suggested that this might be corrected by background subtraction, Ka 2 stripping and smoothing of the X-ray diffraction peaks. A test sample with an unknown concentration was analysed using both methods, and the comparison between the XRPD and DRIFTS results revealed that the DRIFTS method might be more accurate when compared with the XRPD method. Conclusion: Stavudine exhibits polymorphism and this study confirmed that the physicochemical properties of the various polymorphs differ. A glassy (amorphous) form of stavudine was, according to available literature, prepared and characterised for the first time during this study. Two methods for quantifying the amount of form I and form II of stavudine in mixtures comprising these two polymorphs were successfully developed and tested. The DRIFTS method may have generated the more accurate results, since it shows the best correlation between the experimental and theoretical results. Master...|$|R
40|$|Crystal {{engineering}} {{underlies the}} essence of natural affiliation between the molecule {{on the one side}} and the crystal as a supramolecular assembly on the other. Molecular recognition is the fundamental cause for this efficient transformation and if we consider the crystal as a supramolecular entity then {{it is not at all}} difficult to conceive crystallization as an outstanding example of molecular recognition. In general, organic compounds often facilitate closed packed crystal structures as described by A. I. Kitaigorodskii in the form of the close packing principle but based on chemical features, there is still a small window to understand, to rationalize and to fashion new crystal structures. Extending the chemical viewpoint as first proposed by J. M. Robertson, the supramolecular synthon model as a descriptor of collective crystal structures has been invoked that enables one to trail the molecular behaviour from an entropy dominated situation in solution to an enthalpy driven progression in the solid state. After 20 years, the concept of the supramolecular synthon has stood the test of time because of its simplicity and effectiveness towards the implementation in complex crystal structures and has led the scientific community to further handle complex and interesting ideas in structural chemistry and supramolecular synthesis. The complexity of dynamic and progressive behavior of molecules during crystallization may be understood by the analogous argument of protein folding; both these complex phenomena decode the emergence of multiple metastable forms before the final structures are attained. These intermediate kinetically driven species may be high energy polymorphs and <b>pseudopolymorphs</b> of the compound in question or semicompact random globules for proteins. Understanding the role of these species in their respective processes is of critical importance in elucidating mechanisms. As an alternative approach, crystal structure prediction (CSP) is also of fundamental importance in the context of understanding the crystallization process. All energy based computational methods of CSP address this problem by scanning the multi-dimensional energy hypersurface. This is performed by computing lattice energy changes with respect to parameters like unit cell dimensions, space group symmetry and the positional coordinates of atoms in the asymmetric unit. Further, the computational prediction of the crystal structure of an organic compound results in several choices, and it is possible that a collection of some of these when taken together forms a pattern that mimics the course of the crystallization process very much in the manner that structure correlation mimics covalent bond breaking and making. With all these developments, one is truly at the stage today when any experimental or computed crystal structure is just that, a crystal structure of the molecule in question and it is part of a complex and dynamic structural space which may include a part of the supramolecular reaction trajectory for crystallization itself. Accordingly, this thesis emphasizes the importance of kinetic events during crystallization and proposes some strategies to access the inaccessible domains of this structural space of a given compound. I have exploited the supramolecular synthon model to understand the kinetics of the crystallization process and have further extended this understanding towards the isolation of stoichiometric ternary solids. The synthon model also helps one to provide a logical step to explore these remote domains of the complex hyperenergy surface that have collectively been termed as the crystal structure landscape of the compound in question. The precise descriptions of the chapters are mentioned below. Chapter 2 describes fluorosubstitution as a unique chemical probe to explore the high energy crystal structures of benzoic acid in ambient conditions. This landscape exploration of benzoic acid is based on the robust (kinetically favoured) supramolecular homosynthon as well as consistent fluorosubstitution in native compound. This analysis is also supported by synthon based crystal structure prediction which is one of the best ways of monitoring high energy virtual crystal structures. Chapter 3 extends the idea of landscape exploration towards multicomponent systems. The incorporation of an additional compound during crystallization facilitates even complex kinetic environments but using fluorosubstitution as a chemical probe, it again helps to analyse the high energy virtual domains of the given multicomponent system. Similar to chapter 2, the landscape exploration of multicomponent system is also based on the robust (kinetically favoured) supramolecular heterosynthon as well as consistent fluorosubstitution in the native multicomponent system. Chapter 4 emphasizes the importance of synthon modularity as a chemical probe to traverse in the crystal structure landscape of the given multicomponent system. Here, I have quantified the role of the definitive synthon, by using the supramolecular synthon based fragment approach (SBFA), in the emergence of polymorphism in cocrystals. In latter part of this chapter, I utilized this collective kinetic information in order to realize the combinatorial nature of the crystallization process and showed the complex combinatorial synthesis of ternary solids which itself is considered to be an arduous exercise. Chapter 5 discusses the importance of kinetic information which were fetched from the corresponding multicomponent landscapes and were further utilized for combinatorial synthesis of ternary solids. Although the combinatorial idea is well established in solution, this chapter highlights the first experimental evidence of this idea in the solid state and shows preferred amplification of certain supramolecular synthons from corresponding libraries in the supersaturated crystallizing medium. Chapter 6 extends the combinatorial idea of crystallization even further by using highly flexible organic compounds that collectively provide larger structural space during crystallization. Using the delicate kinetic information about the molecular and supramolecular features, this chapter describes the preferential selection of molecular conformation and supramolecular synthons from the supersaturated solution during the molecule→crystal pathway. In summary, the idea of the crystal structure landscape provides an extended interpretation about some of the complex ideas namely, crystal energy landscape and polymorphism in modern crystal engineering. The crystallization of an organic compound often depends upon intrinsic chemical features and accordingly one selects optimized crystallization routes in the corresponding landscape through decisive experimental conditions. As a final note, the idea of the crystal structure landscape enables one to (at least qualitatively) understand the importance of crystallization kinetics which is understandably a difficult task...|$|R
