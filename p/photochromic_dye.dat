40|$|To {{measure the}} {{thickness}} of liquid films from 10 to 60 μm, we used <b>photochromic</b> <b>dye</b> activation. And we used silicone oil with 10 centi-Stokes and commercial photochromic dyes. To make films with exact and known thicknesses, we used two glass wafers. A film formed between two wafers after placing a drop of liquid of known volume on one wafer and covering the other. The film thickness could be estimated from the diameter of wafer and the dropped liquid volume. To quantitatively evaluate the result, captured the images using digital camera then analyzed the images using the image tool.

40|$|<b>Photochromic</b> organic <b>dyes</b> can {{be widely}} used in {{materials}} for optically rewritable data storage, photonic switches, memories, sensors, or actuators. In recent years photochromic materials based on nanoparticles became particularly focused, since they can be dispersed in colloidal aqueous suspensions or incorporated in thin films, avoiding problems of light scattering or shallow light penetration in bulk materials. Spiropyrans, spirooxazines and diarylethenes were {{by far the most}} researched photochromes in nanoparticulate systems. Great effort was made to investigate <b>photochromic</b> <b>dyes</b> incorporated into organic nanoparticles via self-assembly strategies, covalent linkage or dispersion of the molecular species in polymers (doping). Nanoparticles composed of solely <b>photochromic</b> <b>dyes</b> were prepared by laser ablation and reprecipitation techniques. <b>Photochromic</b> <b>dyes</b> were microencapsulated by self-assembly, soap free-, emulsion/microemulsion/miniemulsion or free radical- (co) polymerization. Sol-gel processing from silane precursors to poly(organo) siloxane matrix is a common method to synthesize doped or core-shell photochromic organogels. Coloured forms of some photochromes display fluorescence; however, a more effective strategy for fluorescence modulation with photochromic molecules is integrating them, covalently or noncovalently, with a separate fluorophore in the same nanoparticles. These photoresponsive nanoparticles may find applications particularly in biological fields such as cell labelling and bioimaging. The purpose of this review is to summarize the preparation methods of organic nanoparticles containing <b>photochromic</b> <b>dyes</b> and to investigate their typical properties derived from their nanoparticulate character...|$|R

40|$|Liquid {{atomization}} {{system has}} been extensively applied as the most significant process in many industrial fields. In the internal combustion engine, the combustion phenomenon is strongly influenced by the spray characteristics of the fuel given by the atomization process. In order to completely understand the whole atomization process, a detail investigation of relations between the liquid jet characteristics and the breakup phenomenon is required. In this study, a non-intrusive method called as laser tagging method by <b>photochromic</b> <b>dye</b> has been developed with aim to study the breakup process of liquid sheet in detail, covering from the behavior in film until disintegrated into ligament and droplets. The laser tagging method by <b>photochromic</b> <b>dye</b> {{is based on a}} shift in the absorption spectrum of <b>photochromic</b> <b>dye</b> molecules tagged by ultraviolet laser. The shift results a color change at the tagged region of liquid containing the dye. In this study, the motions of the dye traces were analyzed as the liquid surface velocity. As a result, liquid sheet was found to keep its velocity constantly in film before suddenly increase around broken point. However, it then decreased after broken into droplets. By forming a set of four points of dye traces on the liquid sheet, the change of relative position of the set enabled the measurement of deformation and rotational motion of the liquid sheet. As a result, the normal strain of the liquid sheet parallel to the flow direction depended on the flow behavior of ligament formation...|$|E

The photochromic performance of the dyed and printed fabrics was investigated {{in terms of the}} degree of photocoloration, background colour, fading characteristics, fatigue resistance and storage stability. A traditional aqueous-based disperse dyeing method was used to apply the <b>photochromic</b> <b>dyes</b> to polyester fabric. Solvent-based dyeing methods also were investigated for application of the <b>photochromic</b> <b>dyes</b> to polyester fabric. Solvent-based inks were formulated and applied to polyester and cotton fabrics by digital inkjet printing. The photochromic performance and colour fastness to light and washing of the photochromic fabrics were evaluated and comparison made. UV/visible spectra of the commercial <b>photochromic</b> <b>dyes</b> in a range of solvents were obtained and interpreted in terms of solvent polarity. On the basis of this study, the photochromic performance of the fabrics was improved by selecting the appropriate application solvents which transferred minimum background colours onto the fabrics. A new method of evaluating lightfastness of photochromic fabrics was established, aimed at replacing the conventional method by an instrumental method. This method was based on comparing the decrease in the degree of photocoloration of photochromic fabrics after light exposure with measured values of the colour differences of the blue wool references after fixed periods of light exposure. Two <b>photochromic</b> <b>dyes</b> were synthesized by azo coupling of a spironaphtho[2, 1 -b]oxazine with diazonium salts obtained from p-nitroaniline, and m-nitroaniline. Molecular modeling of the new photochromic systems, which are referred to as azospirooxazine dyes, showed that the dyes were predicted to have the potential to show photochromism. Thus, the photochromism of the azospirooxazine dyes in a range of solvents was investigated. The investigations showed that the dyes performed differently in different solvents in terms of the hue, the rate of the photochromic colour change and the colour reversibility...|$|R

In order to ensure an optimal efficiency of the operation in these industries, a fundamental study on the interfacial flow profiles of the liquid film is of great importance. However, it is generally difficult to experimentally predict the interfacial profiles of liquid film flow on inclined wall due to the instable wavy flow that usually formed on the liquid film surface. In this paper, the liquid film surface velocity was measured by using a non-intrusive technique called as <b>photochromic</b> <b>dye</b> marking method. This technique utilizes the color change of liquid containing the <b>photochromic</b> <b>dye</b> when exposed to the UV light source.

It {{is based on an}} epoxysilane as network former, an organic bisepoxide as spacer, an organic amine as thermal cross linker and surface modi®ed SiO 2 nanoparticles as ®llers. This coating system is compatible with different <b>photochromic</b> <b>dyes,</b> like oxazines and pyrans. Photochromic coatings with blue, yellow, red, green, violet and neutral tints were prepared on ¯at glass and PMMA substrates by dip coating and cured for 3 h at 1008 C. The photochromic coatings show the following properties: the transmittance changes reversibly between 80 and 20 % with half fading times of about 2 20 s (comparable to the half fading time of the appropriate dye in ethanolic solution) after UV irradiation for 15 s with 5 mW/cm 2. The coatings show a scratch hardness of about 15 g (scratch test with Vickers indenter, coating thickness 10 mm).
