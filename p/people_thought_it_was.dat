500|$|In an April 2010 {{interview}} with South Yorkshire newspaper The Star, Grant expressed his disappointment with the side-project band's sudden increase in success and awareness, {{in which he}} claimed that he wanted the band to continue playing in clubs with a slower ascendency to the bigger venues. The tour promoter however suggested that Renegades should play slightly bigger venues for the second tour than of those seen on their debut. Looking back on {{this version of the}} band, Grant Nicholas explained in an {{interview with}} Culture Deluxe, that the project was not a big marketing plan, but announced it without saying exactly what was happening. Some <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a name change, Grant recording a solo album, while others got the idea from the start. He described problems with promoters printing [...] "Feeder" [...] on the tickets, leading to a misunderstanding that a more mainstream set was expected.|$|E
500|$|By October 1974, the Australia-only album High Voltage {{had been}} recorded. It took only ten days and {{was based on}} {{instrumental}} songs written by the Young brothers, with lyrics added by Scott. Within a few months, the band's line-up had stabilised, featuring Scott, the Young brothers, bassist Mark Evans and drummer Phil Rudd. Later that year they released the single [...] "It's a Long Way to the Top", for which a well-known promotional video was made for the program Countdown, featuring the band miming the song {{on the back of}} a flatbed truck. The song is regarded as their perennial rock anthem. It was included on their second album, TNT (1975), which was also released only in Australia and New Zealand. T.N.T. featured the song [...] "High Voltage", which was the first song written and recorded for the album. Because [...] "High Voltage" [...] was released as a single before T.N.T. was released, some <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the title track to AC/DC's debut album.|$|E
500|$|From {{his first}} National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) college games for DePaul on, Mikan {{dominated}} his peers. He intimidated opponents with his size and strength, was unstoppable on offense with his hook shot, and soon established {{a reputation as}} one of the hardest and grittiest players in the league, often playing through injuries and punishing opposing centers with hard fouls. In addition, Mikan also surprised the basketball world with his unique ability of goaltending, i.e. jumping so high that he swatted the ball away before it could pass the hoop. In today's basketball, touching the ball after it reaches its apex is a violation, but in Mikan's time it was legal because <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> impossible anyone could reach that high. [...] "We would set up a zone defense that had four men around the key and I guarded the basket", Mikan later recalled his DePaul days. [...] "When the other team took a shot, I'd just go up and tap it out." [...] As a consequence, the NCAA and later the NBA, outlawed goaltending. One of the few opposing centers to have any success against Mikan was Bob Kurland, a seven-footer from Oklahoma A.|$|E
5000|$|Bowie himself once {{claimed that}} the song was not {{intended}} to be an anthem for glam, that it actually carried a darker message of apocalypse. According to an interview Bowie gave to Rolling Stone magazine in 1973, the boys are carrying the same news that the newscaster was carrying in the song [...] "Five Years" [...] from Ziggy Stardust; the news being the fact that the Earth had only five years left to live. Bowie explains: [...] "All the Young Dudes is a song about this news. It's no hymn to the youth, as <b>people</b> <b>thought.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> completely the opposite." [...] "All the Young Dudes" [...] is also thought of as a gay anthem. Lou Reed said [...] "It's a Gay Anthem! A rallying call to the young dudes to come out in the streets and show that they were beautiful and gay and proud of it." ...|$|R

500|$|Elton John, the English {{singer and}} songwriter, {{appears as a}} guest vocalist for Chef's song, {{in one of the}} {{earliest}} celebrity spoof appearances on South Park; Trey Parker, who provided the voice for Elton John, said many <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the actual John singing because his impression was so accurate. In another musical reference featured in the episode, several characters claim the real-life Canadian rock group Loverboy wrote a song {{about the fact that the}} DNA of an elephant and pig will not splice. [...] "An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig" [...] includes several pop cultural references to films and television shows. The last line in the episode, [...] "That'll do pig", spoken by Cartman, is a reference to the final line of the 1995 film Babe, a movie about a talking pig, which Stone has described as one of his favorite films. When the boys try to tell Officer Barbrady about the clone, he suggests that the boys have seen too many episodes of the X-Files. In the scene in which Pip is introduced, Stan asks Pip about his peculiar name, but Cartman interrupts Pip during his answer. Pip's reply – [...] "my father's family name being Pirrip and my Christian name Phillip, my infant tongue--" [...] – is identical to the opening line of the Charles Dickens novel Great Expectations, which is narrated by its protagonist, Pip. The fourth season episode [...] "Pip" [...] is a parody and comedic retelling of the novel, and stars Pip, who assumes the role of his namesake.|$|E

40|$|The present article {{studies the}} {{opinions}} and ideas death awakes among health professionals. Not only {{the idea of}} their own death, but the death of those patients or relatives they care for. The concept of "death" {{is of paramount importance}} in the development of health professions. Depending on the concept one has about it, attention and care provided to terminal ill patients could differ. In order to run deep in this field a questionnaire was handed out among professionals {{to find out what the}} meaning of death had for them, both at a personal and professional level. The questionnaire requested as well whether beliefs influence life of a terminal ill patient, and the conflicts he or she faces if this happens. Conclusions were rather surprising. In general terms <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> wiser to face death at home better than in hospital, even considering such a circumstance causes stress among relatives, specially children who participate in funeral rites. Another discovery was the high number of believers within the health profession; the preference of a quick death to a painless, full conscientious knowledge of final ending...|$|R
2500|$|When {{the film}} was finally {{released}} and the reviews came in, they revealed that most critics never caught the differences in [...] accent, diction, and timbre between Scott and Bacall. Bacall's accent is pre-World War II, upper middle-class New York metropolitan, often mistaken for Mid-Atlantic due to the broad [...] "A" [...] and nonrhotic pronunciation of words containing [...] "R". Unlike Scott's inherited low tone, Bacall originally had a naturally high tone with a nasal timbre and fast tempo, but had trained herself to pitch her voice lower and slow down her delivery. Despite Bacall's [...] "mannered toughness" [...] and Scott's [...] "breathy theatricality", when Bacall did the voice-over for a 1990s cat-food commercial, some <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Scott.|$|E

[...] White House deputy press secretary Eric Schultz said he agreed with Giuliani [...] "that it was a horrible thing to say", but said he would leave it up to the people who heard Giuliani directly to assess if the remarks were appropriate for the event. Although he received some support for his controversial comments, Giuliani said he also received several death threats within 48 hours.|$|E

2500|$|The Chronicles have a British Victorian era flavour {{that was}} much in fashion during Lewis's lifetime, but may now be seen as {{politically}} incorrect. Of Lewis, Kyrie O'Connor writes: [...] "In his time, <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> amusing {{to make fun of}} other cultures. We don't. Read the stories, ask questions, and remember that the person who wrote this story was altogether too human." [...] Claims of racism can be seen as countered by Lewis's positive portrayal of two Calormenes and the lack of racism shown to them by Narnian nobility. In The Horse and His Boy, the female protagonist Aravis is a Calormene noblewoman who is accepted whole-heartedly by the Archenlanders and Narnians, and comes to marry Shasta/Cor, a prince of a more European ethnicity; a progressive and bold statement by Lewis in a time when mixed relationships were neither as common nor accepted as they have been in more recent years. Accordingly, the moral critique that Lewis provides does not rest on any qualities supposed to be inherent in the Calormene race, such as skin color, but rests on the tyrannical values of the hegemonical Calormene culture, in which freedom is scorned and the weak must give way to the strong. [...] Depicting Lewis’ moral critique of the Calormene culture as a ‘racist’ critique would therefore require making the tacit and racist claim, and one not made by Lewis, that morality is an inherent racial rather than cultural characteristic. In The Last Battle, the young Calormene warrior Emeth (whose name is Hebrew for 'truth') is deemed a worthy person by Aslan regardless of his skin colour {{and despite the fact that}} he was a worshipper of Tash. Indeed, Lewis goes on to mention in The Last Battle that those who worship Tash and who are virtuous are in fact worshipping Aslan, and those who are immoral and who worship Aslan are in fact worshipping Tash: ...|$|E

2500|$|Rich's {{destructive}} personal behavior famously culminated at the CMA {{awards ceremony}} for 1975, when he presented {{the award for}} Entertainer of the Year, while visibly intoxicated. After stumbling through {{the names of the}} nominees, Rich clumsily tore open the envelope, took out a cigarette lighter, and lit the paper on fire with the winner's name. While the paper burned, he announced that the winner of the award was [...] "My friend Mr. John Denver." [...] Some considered it an act of rebellion against the Music Row-controlled Nashville Sound. But many speculated that Rich's behavior was a protest against the award going to Denver, whose music Rich had considered too [...] "pop" [...] and not enough [...] "country". Others, including industry insiders, were outraged, and Rich had trouble having hits throughout 1976, and only had one top-ten with [...] "Since I Fell For You". In a 2016 interview, former CMA Executive Director Jo Walker-Meador speculated that Rich's drunkenness may have been in part due to resentment over his being shut out of the nominations that year, after his success at the 1974 awards. His son Charlie, Jr., says on his website: [...] "...why did he do it? I'll tell you why I thought he did it. #1 He thought it would be funny. He set it up by talking about how the potential winners were probably nervous, as he had been the previous year. #2 Bad judgement. He had recently broken his foot in a freak accident at his home in Memphis. It sounds funny, but he got his foot caught in an awkward position while getting out of a reclining chair. He cracked several bones in his foot. So...Due to the pain, he took pain medication the night of the show: Bad idea! Secondly, he and another country star got to drinking gin and tonics while waiting in the dressing room. The show was long, so by the time Dad was supposed to go on, the drinks on top of the medication got him buzzed. So, there ya' go. That's why I think he did it.
