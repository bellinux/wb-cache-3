5|$|When the <b>price</b> <b>elasticity</b> {{of demand}} for a good is unit (or unitary) elastic (Ed = -1), the {{percentage}} change in quantity demanded is equal to that in price, so a change in price will not affect total revenue.|$|E

5|$|<b>Price</b> <b>elasticity</b> {{of demand}} (PED or Ed) {{is a measure}} used in {{economics}} to show the responsiveness, or elasticity, of the quantity demanded of a good or service {{to a change in}} its price, ceteris paribus. More precisely, it gives the percentage change in quantity demanded in response to a one percent change in price (ceteris paribus).|$|E
5|$|When the <b>price</b> <b>elasticity</b> {{of demand}} for a good is {{relatively}} inelastic (-1 < Ed < 0), the percentage change in quantity demanded is smaller than that in price. Hence, when the price is raised, the total revenue increases, and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|Various {{research}} methods {{are used to}} calculate price elasticities in real life, including analysis of historic sales data, both public and private, and use of present-day surveys of customers' preferences to build up test markets capable of modelling such changes. Alternatively, conjoint analysis (a ranking of users' preferences which can then be statistically analysed) may be used. Approximate estimates of <b>price</b> <b>elasticity</b> can be calculated from the income elasticity of demand, under conditions of preference independence. This approach has been emprirically validated using bundles of goods (e.g. food, healthcare, education, recreation, etc.).|$|E
40|$|Cross <b>price</b> <b>elasticities</b> are {{important}} to market researchers and managers seeking to understand the differential levels of competition among multiple brands in a category. Elasticities provide two types of information. From a strategic perspective, cross <b>price</b> <b>elasticities</b> provide insights into the market structure of the product category. From a tactical perspective, cross <b>price</b> <b>elasticities</b> help managers quantify the impact of price promotions on competing products. Obtaining managerially useful cross <b>price</b> <b>elasticities</b> from store-level scanner data is a challenging task (Cooper 1988; Montgomery 1997; Wedel and Zhang 2004). Statistical problems such as multicollinearity often result in cross price effects of unreasonable magnitude or unreasonable sign. Significant progress in elasticity estimation has been made by constraining the pattern of cross-price elasticities using theories from consumer behavior and economics (Allenby 1989; Russell and Kamakura 1994; Bucklin, Russell and Srinivasan 1998). These procedures seek {{to reduce the number}} coefficients to be estimated and to require cross <b>price</b> <b>elasticities</b> to obey theoretically desirable patterns.

40|$|Abstract The {{flexibility}} of the system depends on the <b>price</b> <b>elasticities.</b> Demand response programs use the <b>price</b> <b>elasticities</b> in order to smooth the load curve and also increases the flexibility {{as well as the}} reliability of the system. Nordic regions have international energy exchange market (Nord pool). This market determines the clearing price after receiving the information from supply and demand sides. This study uses system price from Nord pool market and the electricity consumption from Finland to estimate the hourly <b>price</b> <b>elasticities</b> from 2013 to 2016. The project uses the system of simultaneous equations includes demand and supply sides. Two different models have been applied to estimate the <b>price</b> <b>elasticities</b> consist of TSLS and SUR procedures. On the one hand, there is some evidence support that the electricity price can be exogenous variable in the demand equation; on the other hand, the reaction of industries to the price volatilities indicates the endogenous prices. The hourly <b>price</b> <b>elasticities</b> during peak load time differ from off-peak load time. The range of the <b>price</b> <b>elasticities</b> in TSLS model is from − 0. 001 to − 0. 027. The size of <b>price</b> <b>elasticities</b> during working hours is larger than the other periods of time, therefore demand response programs would be more successful throughout the peak load time. This result can help policy makers to shift the electricity consumption from peak load time to off-peak load time...|$|R
40|$|Given {{the paucity}} of quality price data, {{it is common to}} rely on "unit value" (average {{expenditure}} per unit) as a proxy for price, but this is an imperfect proxy if households respond to price increases by substituting to lower quality goods. This paper draws on survey data that contain both unit value and price to estimate the severity of quality substitution in Indonesia, finding that it is prevalent. The paper next calculates <b>price</b> <b>elasticities</b> that correct for quality substitution, evaluating and ultimately rejecting a commonly used method for calculating <b>price</b> <b>elasticities</b> using only unit value data. Finally, it demonstrates that quality substitution can result in biased <b>price</b> <b>elasticities</b> even when <b>price</b> is perfectly observed.

5|$|When the <b>price</b> <b>elasticity</b> {{of demand}} for a good is {{perfectly}} elastic (Ed is − ∞), any increase in the price, no matter how small, will cause the quantity demanded for the good to drop to zero. Hence, when the price is raised, the total revenue falls to zero. This situation is typical for goods that have their value defined by law (such as fiat currency); if a 5 dollar bill were sold for anything more than 5 dollars, nobody would buy it, so demand is zero.|$|E
5|$|When the <b>price</b> <b>elasticity</b> {{of demand}} for a good is {{perfectly}} inelastic (Ed = 0), changes in the price do not affect the quantity demanded for the good; raising prices will always cause total revenue to increase. Goods necessary to survival can be classified here; a rational person {{will be willing to}} pay anything for a good if the alternative is death. For example, a person in the desert weak and dying of thirst would easily give all the money in his wallet, no matter how much, for a bottle of water if he would otherwise die. His demand is not contingent on the price.|$|E
5|$|The size of {{the rebound}} effect is {{determined}} by the <b>price</b> <b>elasticity</b> of demand for the good. In a perfectly competitive market where fuel is the sole input used, if the price of fuel remains constant but efficiency is doubled, the effective price of travel would be halved (twice as much travel can be purchased). If in response, the amount of travel purchased more than doubles (i.e. demand is price elastic), then fuel consumption would increase, and the Jevons paradox would occur. If demand is price inelastic, the amount of travel purchased would less than double, and fuel consumption would decrease. However, goods and services generally use more than one type of input (e.g. fuel, labour, machinery), and other factors besides input cost may also affect price. These factors tend to reduce the rebound effect, making the Jevons paradox less likely to occur.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{challenges}} the growing {{consensus in the}} literature (Stone, 2005; Dodds, 2007) that medieval English peasants and manorial managers were price responsive in their production decisions. Using prices of and acreages planted with wheat, barley, and oats on 49 manors held by the bishop of Winchester from 1349 - 70, we estimate <b>price</b> <b>elasticities</b> of supply for each grain in aggregate and on each particular manor. Aggregate <b>price</b> <b>elasticities</b> of supply for wheat and oats {{were not significantly different}} than zero, and barley aggregate elasticities of supply were significant but very low. These elasticities are low compared with <b>price</b> <b>elasticities</b> of supply estimated for developing and developed countries in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Attempting to explain the variation in the estimated <b>price</b> <b>elasticities</b> for individual manors, market concentration had a significant, positive effect on <b>price</b> <b>elasticities</b> of wheat and oat supply. In the end, the low levels of price responsiveness in the post-Black Death period suggest that commercialisation was not as dominant in the medieval English economy as has been argued.

5|$|In {{his book}} which {{presented}} {{the model to}} the general public, Paul Krugman used {{the example of the}} aircraft industry, with the two players being Airbus and Boeing. In fact, Krugman and Baldwin examined the industry for wide bodied aircraft {{in the context of the}} model in a 1988 paper. The authors calibrate an extended version of the model in order to examine the effect of a subsidy to Airbus by European governments, and its presence in a market which can only support two firms at most, worldwide. They find that the subsidy had an unambiguously negative effect on welfare of the United States and a positive effect on rest of the world, which benefits from lower prices. The result for Europe hinges on <b>price</b> <b>elasticity</b> of demand; for relatively inelastic demand the net effect of subsidy is positive with most of the benefits accruing to European consumers, but for elastic demand, social welfare in Europe goes down. Importantly, unlike in the baseline Brander and Spencer model, Krugman and Baldwin find that the changes to consumer surplus resulting from the subsidy and entry, dominate the effect of changes in firm profits in social welfare calculations.|$|E
5|$|On 27 September 1999, Color Air {{terminated}} all {{flights and}} ceased operations. Sunde {{stated that he}} regretted having started the airline, {{and said that he}} had overestimated the synergies between his ferry company and the airline, but also underestimated the <b>price</b> <b>elasticity</b> for business travel. In particular, the frequent flyer programs that SAS and Braathens had made it difficult to convince corporate travelers to switch to Color Air. Sunde believed that the company would continue to lose money in 2000. 220 employees lost their jobs, while Color Group estimated it lost NOK400 million on the airline. There were discussions concerning cooperation with, or a take-over by, British Airways, but these discussions did not lead to an agreement. In total, Color Air flew 430,000 passengers, effectively subsidizing each passenger with almost NOK1000. The company was not declared bankrupt, as Sunde wanted to insure his good reputation by paying everyone he owed money. While this was about NOK10 million in airport fees and smaller sums to other parties, the largest creditors were the two aircraft leasing companies, to whom NOK270 million was owed {{for the rest of the}} rental period. The 20,000 people who had tickets with Color Air were all rebooked onto Braathens flights. After NOK170 million in debt was registered by the company, and assets were only worth NOK17 million, Color Air was declared bankrupt on 10 November 1999.|$|E

25|$|The main {{defensive}} {{response of}} the Dutch economy was in capital investment. The enormous capital stock amassed during the Golden Age was redirected away from investment in commerce, agricultural land (where rents went down appreciably {{in a short period}} of time), and real estate (house rents also sharply declined), and instead in the direction of other, rather high-risk investments. One of these was the whaling industry in which the Noordsche Compagnie had held a Dutch monopoly in the first half of the century. After its charter expired other companies entered this market, leading to an expansion of the Dutch whaling fleet from about 75 ships to 200 ships after 1660. The results were disappointing, however, due to overfishing, a high <b>price</b> <b>elasticity</b> of demand due to substitutability of vegetable oils for whale oil, and the competition of foreign whalers.|$|E
