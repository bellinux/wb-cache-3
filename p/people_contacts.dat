40|$|This paper envisions {{an urban}} {{scenario}} where people carry radio devices {{that can be}} dynamically networked, by exploiting human contact opportunities, to create unplanned, improvised and localized wireless connectivity, which has been recently called Pocket Switched Networks (PSN). PSNs are a subclass of Delay Tolerant Networks, but the fascinating idea of considering people as the switching nodes of a mobile network infrastructure is progressively moving the application of DTN from rural, or deep space, to urban scenarios where nodes are more densily distributed, and <b>people</b> <b>contacts</b> are more frequent and dependent on their social relationships. In such a scenario, the design of forwarding protocols is heavily influenced by human mobility, whose understanding has motivated {{a large amount of}} researches mainly addressed (i) to the analysis of the distribution of contacts and thei...|$|E

40|$|Background and Purpose. Poststroke {{depression}} (PSD) is {{a common}} complication after stroke. There is no adequate treatment for PSD. This study examined efficacy of cognitive rehabilitation therapy (CRT) {{in the treatment of}} PSD among stroke survivors. Methods. An experimental design, 30 participants with poststroke depression were randomly assigned into 3 groups of cognitive rehabilitation therapy (CRT), psychoeducation (PE), and the control group (CG). CRT consisted of nine sessions with three-phased sessions focusing on activity stimulation, negative thoughts, and <b>people</b> <b>contacts,</b> PE consisted of nine sessions focusing on knowledge on stroke and poststroke depression, and the CG group was on the waiting list. The BDI scale was used for assessing PSD at posttest. Results. There was {{a significant difference in the}} efficacy of CRT, PE, and the CG on PSD, with CRT–CG mean difference of − 9. 4 [*]±[*] 3. 11 and PE–CG 1. 0 [*]±[*] 3. 83. Furthermore, stress was not a confounding variable on the efficacy of CRT. The type of therapy significantly influenced PSD at posttest, with the CRT having greater mean reduction to CG (− 11. 1 [*]±[*] 3. 1) than PE to the CG (3. 0 [*]±[*] 3. 8). Conclusions. Cognitive rehabilitation therapy significantly reduced poststroke depression. Hence, it should be integrated as an adjunct treatment of poststroke depression...|$|E
