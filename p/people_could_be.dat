5|$|During the 20th century, Piccadilly {{became known}} {{as a place to}} acquire heroin. Jazz trumpeter Dizzy Reece {{recalled}} people queuing outside Piccadilly's branch of Boots for heroin pills in the late 1940s. By the 1960s, the street and surrounding area were notorious as the centre of London's illegal drug trade, where heroin and cocaine could be purchased on the black market from unscrupulous chemists. By 1982, up to 20 <b>people</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> seen queueing at a chemist dealing in illegal drugs in nearby Shaftesbury Avenue.|$|E
5|$|In April 1878, L'Estrange reappeared on the Australian {{scene with}} a new {{performance}} – gas ballooning. The first balloon ascent in Australia {{had been made in}} Melbourne in 1853, with Sydney following five years later in December 1858. The idea that <b>people</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> lifted from the ground to fly and return safely fired the imagination of the public, and the novelty of balloon ascents continued to draw large crowds through the 1860s and 1870s. No doubt the very real chance of disaster and injury added to the crowd's keen interest, as mishaps were not uncommon.|$|E
5|$|The third letter openly {{incorporates}} Swift's {{argument that}} political authority {{stems from the}} consent of a population. As such, the third letter {{has been seen as}} a response in part to the Declaratory Act, which had undermined the independence and the authority of Irish legislature and judiciary in favour of the British. The Declaratory Act removed the ability for any in Ireland to speak for the people of Ireland, and it was necessary for the act to be removed before the <b>people</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> heard.|$|E

5|$|In What Starts Wars: Intentional Delusions Stratton {{presented}} nations, themselves {{collections of}} people, as triggering war from several delusions. Three of those delusions held by citizens were {{that their own}} country was a paragon of peace, that its arms were only to defend the land, and that when it fought, it fought only for what was right. Blaming the enemy rounded out this list justifying war. Stratton believed and stated <b>people</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> freed of these delusions {{and that there was}} no will to war integral to human nature. He saw both the need for and the ways to eliminate war in individuals and in their ways, and not in abstract or innate traits. Florence Finch Kelly, reviewing the book for the New York Times, saw Stratton's placing of both the blame and the responsibility on persons, of identifying the roots of war in the psyches of the men and women his readers, as an action likely to discomfit those readers.|$|E
5|$|Current {{research}} suggests that the rates of self-harm are much higher among young people with the average age of onset between 14 and 24. The earliest reported incidents of self-harm are in children between 5 and 7 years old. In the UK in 2008 rates of self-harm in young <b>people</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> as high as 33%. In addition there appears to be an increased risk of self-harm in college students than among the general population. In a study of undergraduate students in the US, 9.8% of the students surveyed indicated that they had purposefully cut or burned themselves on at least one occasion in the past. When the definition of self-harm was expanded to include head-banging, scratching oneself, and hitting oneself along with cutting and burning, 32% of the sample said they had done this. In Ireland, a study found that instances of hospital-treated self-harm were much higher in city and urban districts, than in rural settings. The CASE (Child & Adolescent Self-harm in Europe) study suggests that the life-time risk of self-injury is ~1:7 for women and ~1:25 for men.|$|E

25|$|In 1881, {{he took a}} job as {{a teacher}} in Oconto, Wisconsin. There, he {{continued}} to read voraciously, and had a particular attraction for science. It was here that he started to develop a passion for helping people understand science. He believed that science was the key to the future of society, and that if <b>people</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> taught to think with the reasoned, thoughtful, unbiased critical perspective of science, that much suffering in the world could be alleviated.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{research}} led to {{the hypothesis}} that typical expectancy shifts were displayed more often by those who attributed their outcomes to ability, whereas those who displayed atypical expectancy {{were more likely to}} attribute their outcomes to chance. This was interpreted that <b>people</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> divided into those who attribute to ability (an internal cause) versus those who attribute to luck (an external cause). Bernard Weiner argued that rather than ability-versus-luck, locus may relate to whether attributions are made to stable or unstable causes.|$|E

25|$|Additional {{lifeboats}} {{could be}} stored {{within reach of}} the davits on the deck house roof, and in an emergency the gantry davits could reach lifeboats {{on the other side}} of the ship, providing that none of the funnels was obstructing the way. The aim of this design was to enable all the lifeboats to be launched, even if the ship developed a list that would normally prevent lifeboats being launched on the side opposite to the list. However, several of these davits were placed abreast of funnels, defeating that purpose. The ship carried 48 lifeboats, capable of carrying at least 75 people each. Thus, 3,600 <b>people</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> carried by the lifeboats, more than the maximum number of people the ship could carry.|$|E
25|$|Rather {{like their}} Olympic counterparts, Soviet rugby players had a fair degree of shamateurism. Both the Olympics and rugby union were officially amateur, {{but this was}} not really the case. For example, the Dinamo clubs were {{sponsored}} and financed by the KGB, but no one could say that openly that some athletes were full-time shamateurs, and received bonuses for winning including dollars. Masters of Sport were full time, and paid by their sports society. They received 180 rubles each year, plus 30-40 rubles if they were capped for the USSR team paid for by the USSR sports committee. There were frequently unofficial bonuses, and some <b>people</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> Masters of Sport for life, meaning that they would receive pay long after their retirement.|$|E
25|$|While prospectors {{flooded the}} area, {{along with them}} came those who would service the nascent mining industry. This {{included}} stagecoach lines that traveled between Sidney and the Black Hills carrying freight and passengers. Sometimes stagecoaches would depart Sidney for Deadwood three times each day. Conditions on the stagecoaches were usually cramped as upwards of sixteen <b>people</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> carried at a time. Between 1874 and 1880 most of the supplies and freight coming {{to and from the}} gold camps traveled this trail. Thousands of stagecoaches and wagons are estimated to have traveled the route during this time. At the peak of the gold rush in 1878 and 1879, fifty to seventy-five freight wagons left Sidney every day and an estimated 22-million pounds of freight traveled along the trail.|$|E
