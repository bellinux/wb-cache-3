5|$|Already in his {{lifetime}} his works were adapted for theatrical, operatic and musical <b>presentations</b> <b>and</b> for the emerging film industry. Writers and poets devoted works to him, or used him or his works as inspiration. Painters created works inspired by Sienkiewicz's novels, and their works were gathered in Sienkiewicz-themed albums and exhibitions. The names of his characters were given {{to a variety of}} products. The popularity of Quo Vadis in France, where it was the best-selling book of 1900, is shown by the fact that horses competing in a Grand Prix de Paris event were named for characters in the book. In the United States, Quo Vadis sold 800,000 copies in eighteen months. To avoid intrusive journalists and fans, Sienkiewicz sometimes traveled incognito.|$|E

5|$|Bowie {{performed}} {{several of}} the album's songs during a press tour that preceded his highly theatrical Glass Spider Tour, which played to a combined audience {{of as many as}} six million fans. Bowie wanted to produce a live show that picked up where his aborted 1974 Diamond Dogs Tour left off. Although considered financially successful and well attended, the tour itself was critically dismissed. Bowie designed his next few tours specifically to avoid the problems that the Glass Spider Tour was criticized for by avoiding overly theatrical stage <b>presentations</b> <b>and</b> focusing on his music. Despite the criticism, Bowie maintained that performing on this tour was the most fun he had had on tour up to that point in his career.|$|E

The Virginia Tech Review Panel report, also released in August 2007, placed this diagnosis in the spring of Cho's eighth-grade year, and his parents sought treatment for him through medication and therapy. In high school, Cho was placed in special education under the 'emotional disturbance' classification. He was excused from oral <b>presentations</b> <b>and</b> participation in class conversation and received 50 minutes a month of speech therapy. He continued receiving mental health therapy as well until his junior year, when Cho rejected further therapy.|$|E

5|$|Artist Takayoshi Sato {{corrected}} {{inconsistencies in}} the plot, and designed the game's cast of characters. As a young employee, Sato was initially restricted to basic {{tasks such as}} font design and file sorting. He also created 3D demos and <b>presentations,</b> <b>and</b> taught older staff members the fundamentals of 3D modeling. However, he was not credited for this work as {{he did not have}} as much respect within Konami as older employees. Sato eventually approached the company's higher-ups with a short demo movie he had rendered, and threatened to withhold this technical knowledge from other staff members if he was not assigned to 3D work. As a consequence, his superior had to give in to his demand, and he was allowed to do character designs. Instead of relying on illustrations, Sato conceived the characters of Silent Hill while creating their computer-generated models. He gave each their own distinctive characteristics, but made Harry almost completely neutral as he wanted to avoid forcing interpretations of the game on the players. Creating the skull shapes for the faces of the American cast was difficult because he had no Caucasian co-workers to use for reference. Although Sato was largely responsible for the game's cinematics and characters at this point, his superior still did not want to fully credit his work, and intended to assign a visual supervisor to him. To prevent this from happening, Sato volunteered to create the full-motion videos of Silent Hill by himself. Over the course of two and a half years, he lived in the development team's office, as he had to render the scenes with the approximately 150 Unix-based computers of his coworkers after they left work {{at the end of a}} day.|$|E
