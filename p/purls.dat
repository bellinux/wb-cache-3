25|$|While most crochet is {{made with}} a hook, {{there is also a}} method of {{crocheting}} with a knitting loom. This is called loomchet. Slip stitch crochet is very similar to knitting. Each stitch in slip stitch crochet is formed the same way as a knit or purl stitch which is then bound off. A person working in slip stitch crochet can follow a knitted pattern with knits, <b>purls,</b> and cables, and get a similar result.|$|E
2500|$|In using circulars to knit flat {{pieces of}} fabric the two ends are used just as two {{separate}} needles would be. [...] The knitter holds one tip {{in each hand}} and knits straight across {{the width of the}} fabric, turns the work, and knits or <b>purls</b> back the other way. [...] Using circular needles has some advantages, for example, the weight of the fabric is more evenly distributed, therefore less taxing, on the arms and wrists of the knitter and, the length of the cable may be longer than would be practical with rigid needles since the cable and fabric rest in the lap of the knitter rather than extending straight out past the arms.|$|E
60|$|That was {{the view}} that James Todd and Peter Willard took of it, and {{they used to call}} on Grace, watch her knitting, and come away with their heads full of {{complicated}} calculations. The whole thing hung on one point--to wit, what size the sweater was going to be. If it was large, then it must be for Peter; if small, then James was the lucky man. Neither dared to make open inquiries, but it began to seem almost impossible to find out the truth without them. No masculine eye can reckon up <b>purls</b> and plains and estimate the size of chest which the garment is destined to cover. Moreover, with amateur knitters there must always be allowed a margin for involuntary error. There were many cases during the war where our girls sent sweaters to their sweethearts which would have induced strangulation in their young brothers. The amateur sweater of those days was, in fact, practically tantamount to German propaganda.|$|E

Martin was especially anxious to see the great river Amazon, about which he entertained the most romantic ideas,--as well he might, for there is not such another river {{in the world for}} size, and for the many curious things connected with its waters and its banks. Barney, too, was smitten with an intense desire to visit the diamond mines, which he fancied must be the most brilliant and beautiful sight in the whole world; and when Martin asked him what sort of place he expected to see, he used to say that he [...] "pictur'd in his mind a great many deep and lofty caverns, windin' in an' out an' round about, with the sides and the floors and the ceilin's all of a blaze with glittering di'monds, an' top'zes, an' <b>purls,</b> an' what not; with Naiggurs be the dozen picking them up in handfuls.

60|$|I {{fear that}} I should find these rambles dull, but that their utter lack of {{interest}} amuses me. I will be honest with the reader, though, and any Master Pliable is free to forsake me at this point; for I cannot promise to be really livelier than my walk. There is a Slough of Despond in full view, and not a Delectable Mountain to be seen, unless you choose so to call the high lands about Waltham, which we shall behold dark blue against the western sky presently. As I sally forth upon Benicia Street, the whole suburb of Charlesbridge stretches about me,--a vast space upon which I can embroider any fancy I like as I saunter along. I have no associations with it, or memories of it, and, at some seasons, I might wander for days in the most frequented parts of it, and meet hardly any one I know. It is not, however, to these parts that I commonly turn, but northward, up a street upon which a flight of French-roof houses suddenly settled {{a year or two}} since, with families in them, and many outward signs of permanence, though their precipitate arrival might cast some doubt upon this. I have to admire their uniform neatness and prettiness, and I look at their dormer-windows with the envy of one to whose weak sentimentality dormer- windows long appeared the supreme architectural happiness. But, for all my admiration of the houses, I find a variety that is pleasanter in the landscape, when I reach, beyond them, a little bridge which appears to span a small stream. It unites banks lined with a growth of trees and briers nodding their heads above the neighboring levels, and suggesting a quiet water-course, though in fact it is the Fitchburg Railroad that <b>purls</b> between them, with rippling freight and passenger trains and ever-gurgling locomotives. The banks take the earliest green of spring upon their southward slope, and on a Sunday morning of May, when the bells are lamenting the Sabbaths of the past, I find their sunny tranquillity sufficient to give me a slight heart-ache for I know not what. If I descend them and follow the railroad westward half a mile, I come to vast brick-yards, which are not in themselves exciting to the imagination, and which yet, from an irresistible association of ideas, remind me of Egypt, and are forever newly forsaken of those who made bricks without straw; so that I have no trouble in erecting temples and dynastic tombs out of the kilns; while the mills for grinding the clay serve me very well for those sad-voiced sakias or wheel-pumps which the Howadji Curtis heard wailing at their work of drawing water from the Nile. A little farther on I come to the boarding-house built at the railroad side for the French Canadians who have by this time succeeded the Hebrews in the toil of the brick-yards, and who, as they loiter in windy-voiced, good-humored groups about the doors of their lodgings, insist upon bringing before me the town of St. Michel {{at the mouth of the}} great Mont Cenis tunnel, where so many peasant folk like them are always amiably quarreling before the cabarets when the diligence comes and goes. Somewhere, there must be a gendarme with a cocked hat and a sword on, standing with folded arms to represent the Empire and Peace among that rural population; if I looked in-doors, I am sure I should see the neatest of landladies and landladies' daughters and nieces in high black silk caps, bearing hither and thither smoking bowls of bouillon and caf√©-au-lait. Well, it takes as little to make one happy as miserable, thank Heaven! and I derive a cheerfulness from this scene which quite atones to me for the fleeting desolation suffered from the sunny verdure on the railroad bank. With repaired spirits I take my way up through the brick-yards towards the Irish settlement on the north, passing under the long sheds that shelter the kilns. The ashes lie cold about the mouths of most, and the bricks are burnt to the proper complexion; in others these are freshly arranged over flues in which the fire has not been kindled; but in whatever state I see them, I am reminded of brick-kilns of boyhood. They were then such palaces of enchantment as any architect should now vainly attempt to rival with bricks upon the most desirable corner lot of the Back Bay, and were the homes of men truly to be envied: men privileged to stay up all night; to sleep, as it were, out of doors; to hear the wild geese as they flew over in the darkness; to be waking in time to shoot the early ducks that visited the neighboring ponds; to roast corn upon the ends of sticks; to tell and to listen to stories that never ended, save in some sudden impulse to rise and dance a happy hoe-down in the ruddy light of the kiln- fires. If by day they were seen to have the redness of eyes of men that looked upon the whiskey when it was yellow and gave its color in the flask; if now and then the fragments of a broken bottle strewed the scene of their vigils, and a head broken to match appeared among those good comrades, the boyish imagination was not shocked by these things, but accepted them merely as the symbols of a free virile life. Some such life no doubt is still to be found in the Dublin to which I am come by the time my repertory of associations with brick-kilns is exhausted, but, oddly enough, I no longer care to encounter it.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{simplest}} of hand-knitted fabrics, every row of stitches are all knit (or all purl); this creates a garter stitch fabric. Alternating rows of all knit stitches and all <b>purl</b> stitches creates a stockinette pattern/stocking stitch. Vertical stripes (ribbing) are possible by having alternating wales of knit and <b>purl</b> stitches. [...] For example, a common choice is 2x2 ribbing, in which two wales of knit stitches are followed by two wales of <b>purl</b> stitches, etc. Horizontal striping (welting) is also possible, by alternating rows of knit and <b>purl</b> stitches. Checkerboard patterns (basketweave) are also possible, the smallest of which is known as seed/moss stitch: the stitches alternate between knit and <b>purl</b> in every wale and along every row.|$|R
2500|$|Fabrics {{in which}} each knitted row is {{followed}} by a <b>purled</b> row, such as in stockinette/stocking stitch, have a tendency to curl‚Äîtop and bottom curl toward the front (or knitted side) while the sides curl toward the back (or <b>purled</b> side); by contrast, those in which knit and <b>purl</b> stitches are arranged symmetrically (such as ribbing, garter stitch or seed/moss stitch) have more texture and tend to lie flat. Wales of <b>purl</b> stitches have a tendency to recede, whereas those of knit stitches tend to come forward, giving the fabric more stretchability. Thus, the <b>purl</b> wales in ribbing tend to be invisible, since the neighboring knit wales come forward. [...] Conversely, rows of <b>purl</b> stitches tend to form an embossed ridge relative to a row of knit stitches. [...] This is the basis of shadow knitting, in which the appearance of a knitted fabric changes when viewed from different directions.|$|R

5000|$|<b>PURLs</b> are {{themselves}} valid URLs, so their components must {{map to the}} URL specification. The scheme part tells a computer program, such as a Web browser, which protocol to use when resolving the address. The scheme used for <b>PURLs</b> is generally HTTP.

The domain is a hierarchical information space that separates <b>PURLs</b> and allows for <b>PURLs</b> to have different maintainers.

50|$|The {{visual effect}} of shadow {{knitting}} {{is due to}} the different height of the knit stitches on the wrong side rows. A knit stitch is flat, while a <b>purl</b> stitch is raised. Therefore, one can change which color (dark or light) stands out by changing from knit to <b>purl.</b> So the basic idea is to create a pattern in knit stitches in the colors one wants and <b>purl</b> stitches in the background color. When looking straight at the knitted piece, the stitches look approximately the same, but from an angle, only the raised <b>purl</b> stitches are visible.|$|R
50|$|A {{persistent}} uniform {{resource locator}} (PURL) is a {{uniform resource locator}} (URL) (i.e., location-based uniform resource identifier or URI) {{that is used to}} redirect to the location of the requested web resource. <b>PURLs</b> redirect HTTP clients using HTTP status codes. <b>PURLs</b> are used to curate the URL resolution process, thus solving the problem of transitory URIs in location-based URI schemes like HTTP. Technically the string resolution on PURL is like SEF URL resolution.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} types of <b>PURLs</b> are named to {{coincide}} with the HTTP response code that they return.

5000|$|A PURL of type [...] "200" [...] is an [...] "Active PURL", {{in which}} the PURL {{actively}} participates in the creation or aggregation of the metadata returned.

This is to allow continued resolution of the resource if the PURL changes. Some operators prefer to use <b>PURLs</b> of type 301 (indicating that the final URI should be addressed in future requests).|$|E

50|$|In older tatting and {{crocheting}} patterns, picots {{were sometimes}} specified as <b>purls,</b> purl stitches, or pearl stitches. These specifications {{are not to}} be confused with the reverse stitch known as a purl in knitting.|$|E
50|$|In flat knitting, {{generally}} stockinette stitch, the hand-knitter knits from right-to-left on {{one side}} of the fabric, turns the work (over), and then <b>purls</b> right-to-left back to the starting position. Usually the smooth side of the fabric is considered the right side, the one facing outwards for viewing; and the side that faces inwards, towards the body, the ridged side, is known as the wrong side. Thus, flat knitting involves knitting each row on the right side, then purling each row on the wrong side, etc. If each row is knit (no <b>purls)</b> this creates garter stitch, which has the same appearance on both sides and creates horizontal ridges offset by valleys, rather than a knit and purl side. Patterned stitching, such as cables, can be accomplished with either flat knitting, or in the round, however the technique must follow the desired pattern.|$|E
