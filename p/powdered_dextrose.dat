40|$|Cocaine is a {{powerful}} drug {{that comes from the}} leaves of the coca bush, a plant grown in South America. It’s sold as a white powder that is most often snorted (inhaled through the nostrils), {{but it can also be}} dissolved in water and injected, or formed into a solid to be smoked. The cocaine you can buy on the street is rarely pure; often, it’s mixed with other substances, like talcum <b>powder</b> or <b>dextrose,</b> or with other drugs, like amphetamines. Heating cocaine hydrochloride and combining it with baking soda makes crack cocaine, a very strong form of cocaine that can be smoked. Crack is divided up into many tiny “rocks ” that are sold for $ 10 to $ 20 each. This makes crack a fairly cheap drug, per dose. But because the high doesn’t last long and is addictive, people will take many doses in a short time, making cocaine or crack a very expensive drug habit. It’s no wonder less than 1 % of Canadians over the age of 15 use cocaine...|$|R

The following morning, karo corn syrup is given orally, and glucose and insulin levels are measured at 60 and 90 minutes after administration. Normal or excessively high insulin levels are diagnostic. However, equivocal test results require retesting at a later date, or performing a different test.

40|$|Background: Atopic dermatitis, {{a chronic}} {{recurrent}} disease, is frequently encountered in clinical practice. In the last 30 years, {{the prevalence of}} atopic dermatitis has rapidly increased due to industrialization. Therefore, there have been attempts {{in recent years to}} find new ways of treating and preventing atopic dermatitis. Objective: In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, a combination of Bifidobacterium bifidum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus salivarius strains were evaluated in the treatment of atopic dermatitis in pediatric patients. Methods: Forty pediatric patients (23 males and 17 females) aged 1 ∼ 13 years were enrolled. One eligible individual who was approached declined to participate. The probiotic group was administered a probiotic complex containing B. bifidum, L. acidophilus, L. casei, and L. salivarius for 8 weeks. The placebo group, on the other hand, was administered skim milk <b>powder</b> and <b>dextrose.</b> All of the parameters including serum cytokines, eosinophil cationic protein), SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) index, and total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) were measured in both the probiotic group and the placebo group at the end of 8 weeks. Results: Probiotic intervention in pediatric atopic dermatitis patients effectively reduced the SCORAD index and serum cytokines interleukin (IL) - 5, IL- 6, interferon (IFN) γ, and total serum IgE levels, but did not reduce levels o...|$|R
5000|$|Snow powder (or snow sugar) is a non-melting form of {{icing sugar}} usually {{consisting}} of dextrose, starch and anti-binding agents, useful for retaining its structure when dusted onto cakes or pastries that require refrigeration.

40|$|Abstract Background Intermittent {{bouts of}} high-intensity {{exercise}} result in diminished stores of energy substrates, {{followed by an}} accumulation of metabolites, promoting chronic physiological adaptations. In addition, β-alanine has been accepted has an effective physiological hydrogen ion (H +) buffer. Concurrent high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and β-alanine supplementation may result in greater adaptations than HIIT alone. The {{purpose of the current}} study was to evaluate the effects of combining β-alanine supplementation with high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on endurance performance and aerobic metabolism in recreationally active college-aged men. Methods Forty-six men (Age: 22. 2 ± 2. 7 yrs; Ht: 178. 1 ± 7. 4 cm; Wt: 78. 7 ± 11. 9; VO 2 peak: 3. 3 ± 0. 59 l·min - 1) were assessed for peak O 2 utilization (VO 2 peak), time to fatigue (VO 2 TTE), ventilatory threshold (VT), and total work done at 110 % of pre-training VO 2 peak (TWD). In a double-blind fashion, all subjects were randomly assigned into one either a placebo (PL – 16. 5 g <b>dextrose</b> <b>powder</b> per packet; n = 18) or β-alanine (BA – 1. 5 g β-alanine plus 15 g <b>dextrose</b> <b>powder</b> per packet; n = 18) group. All subjects supplemented four times per day (total of 6 g/day) for the first 21 -days, followed by two times per day (3 g/day) for the subsequent 21 days, and engaged in a total of six weeks of HIIT training consisting of 5 – 6 bouts of a 2 : 1 minute cycling work to rest ratio. Results Significant improvements in VO 2 peak, VO 2 TTE, and TWD after three weeks of training were displayed (p 2 peak, VO 2 TTE, TWD and lean body mass were only significant for the BA group after the second three weeks of training. Conclusion The use of HIIT to induce significant aerobic improvements is effective and efficient. Chronic BA supplementation may further enhance HIIT, improving endurance performance and lean body mass. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{gastrointestinal}} tract is populated by {{an array of}} microbial species that {{play an important role}} in metabolic and immune functions. The composition of microorganisms is influenced by the components of the host’s diet and can impact health. In the present study, dietary enrichment of lowbush wild blueberries (LWB) was examined to determine their effect on colon microbial composition and their potential in promoting gut health. The microbial composition and functional potential of the colon microbiota from Sprague Dawley rats fed control diets (AIN 93) and LWB-enriched diets (AIN 93 + 8 % LWB <b>powder</b> substituting for <b>dextrose)</b> for 6 weeks were assessed using Illumina shotgun sequencing and bioinformatics tools. Our analysis revealed an alteration in the relative abundance of 3 phyla and 22 genera as representing approximately 14 and 8 % of all phyla and genera identified, respectively. The LWB-enriched diet resulted in a significant reduction in the relative abundance of the genera Lactobacillus and Enterococcus. In addition, hierarchal analysis revealed a significant increase in the relative abundance of the phylum Actinobacteria, the order Actinomycetales, and several novel genera under the family Bifidobacteriaceae and Coriobacteriaceae, in the LWB group. Functional annotation of the shotgun sequences suggested that approximately 9 % of the 4709 Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Gene and Genome (KEGG) hits identified were impacted by the LWB-diet. Open Reading Frames (ORFs) assigned to KEGG category xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism were significantly greater in the LWB-enriched diet compared to the control and included the pathway for benzoate degradatio...|$|R

Copper {{deficiency}} in potato dextrose agar causes reduced pigmentation in cultures of various fungi. FEMS Microbiology Letters, 276 (2), 165 - 171. Potato dextrose agar (PDA) {{is one of}} the most commonly used media for the isolation and cultivation of fungi, with morphological features and pigmentation in culture often being important for identification of cultures. Cultivation of various fungi on different brands and batches of <b>powdered</b> (commercial) potato <b>dextrose</b> media revealed deficient pigmentation in five of 10 media tested. Reduced pigmentation on these media was correlated with low levels of copper and colony colour was restored by the addition of copper. Deficient pigmentation was most pronounced when copper levels in the medium were below 50 ng mL? 1 (50 p. p. b.; 0. 8 ?M). Differences in pigmentation and laccase activity of spore and mycelial preparations were quantified for representative species belonging to the genera Aspergillus, Fusarium, Trichoderma, Cladosporium and Penicillium grown on PDA containing different amounts of copper. A strong positive correlation between laccase activity and copper levels was observed. Differences were also found between batches of raw potatoes, with organically cultivated tubers having higher copper levels than those grown by conventional methods, possibly because of the use of copper-based fungicides in the former case. Routine addition of 1000 ng mL? 1 copper (or standard trace element solutions) to PDA and other undefined media is advised to avoid atypical culture pigmentation and possibly other consequences of reduced activity of copper-requiring enzymes.

40|$|Background: The core gut {{microbiota}} encodes for a metabolic {{capacity that}} often surpasses the metabolic potential of its host. Lowbush wild blueberries (LWB) are {{a rich source}} of bioactive compounds, and the gut microbiota is an important modulator of their activity. The objective of this research is to study the effect of a diet enriched with LWB on the gastrointestinal microbiota’s metabolic potential. Methods: Nine three-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly assigned to two groups. The control group (N= 4) was placed on the AIN 93 diet, and the treatment group (N= 5) was fed the same diet with 8 % (w/w) LWB <b>powder</b> substituting for <b>dextrose.</b> The animals consumed the diets for six weeks, after which they were sacrificed. Functional profiles and metabolic potential of the colon microbiota in response to diet were analyzed using deep whole genome sequencing (WGS). Results: Proteins predicted from WGS DNA sequences were assigned to 3, 746 COG, 5, 577 KEGG, and 4, 474 Pfam families. Statistical comparisons of the protein-coding genes revealed significant changes in 25 Gene Ontology (GO), 186 KEGG, and 20 Pfam protein families representing 2. 1 %, 3. 3 %, and 0. 02 % of all hits identified, respectively. Overall, the combined inquires into these databases represented an emphasis on membrane trafficking, DNA regulation, modification and repair, and nutrient metabolism. Protein families that significantly increased by the enrichment of LWBs were involved with amino acid metabolism, 2, 4 -dienoyl-CoA reductase, metal ion binding, glutamate synthase, REDOX homeostasis, and aryl transferases. In Functional Foods in Health and Disease 2012, 2 (6) : 228 - 241 contrast, protein families involved with integrase/recombinase, reverse transcriptase, and transposon/transposase were at a lower abundance. Conclusions: The results from this study reflect the potential impact that LWBs have on the functional repertoire of bacterial communities in the proximal colon. The results demonstrate a higher potential for the metabolism of amino acids and a lower potential for horizontal integration of plasmids and lower phage/transposon activity in the LWB diet, suggesting that the genome at the time of sampling was more stable. This study helps unravel diverse mechanisms of microbial adaptation to LWBs in the diet of mammals and can provide guidance in optimizing functional diets...|$|R
40|$|Aseptic-Ultra-High-Temperature (UHT) {{products}} are manufactured {{to be free}} of microorganisms capable of growing in the food at normal non-refrigerated conditions at which the food is likely to be held during manufacture, distribution and storage. Two important phases within the process are widely recognised as critical in controlling microbial contamination: the sterilisation steps and the following aseptic steps. Of the microbial hazards, the pathogen spore formers Clostridium botulinum and Bacillus cereus are deemed the most pertinent to be controlled. In addition, due to a relatively high thermal resistance, Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores are considered a concern for spoilage of low acid aseptic-UHT products. A probabilistic exposure assessment model has been developed in order to assess the aseptic-UHT product failure rate associated with these three bacteria. It was a Modular Process Risk Model, based on nine modules. They described: i) the microbial contamination introduced by the raw materials, either from the product (i. e. milk, cocoa and <b>dextrose</b> <b>powders</b> and water) or the packaging (i. e. bottle and sealing component), ii) the sterilisation processes, of either the product or the packaging material, iii) the possible recontamination during subsequent processing of both product and packaging. The Sterility Failure Rate (SFR) was defined as the sum of bottles contaminated for each batch, divided {{by the total number of}} bottles produced per process line run (10 (6) batches simulated per process line). The SFR associated with the three bacteria was estimated at the last step of the process (i. e. after Module 9) but also after each module, allowing for the identification of modules, and responsible contamination pathways, with higher or lower intermediate SFR. The model contained 42 controlled settings associated with factory environment, process line or product formulation, and more than 55 probabilistic inputs corresponding to inputs with variability conditional to a mean uncertainty. It was developed in @Risk and run through Monte Carlo simulations. Overall, the highest SFR was associated with G. stearothermophilus (380000 bottles contaminated in 10 (11) bottles produced) and the lowest to C. botulinum (3 bottles contaminated in 10 (11) bottles produced). Unsurprisingly, SFR due to G. stearothermophilus was due to its ability to survive the UHT treatment. More interestingly, it was identified that SFR due to B. cereus (17000 bottles contaminated in 10 (11) bottles produced) was due to an airborne recontamination of the aseptic tank (49 %) and a post-sterilisation packaging contamination (33 %). A deeper analysis (sensitivity and scenario analyses) was done to investigate how the SFR due to B. cereus could be reduced by changing the process settings related to potential air recontamination source...|$|R
40|$|Introduction:	The antioxidative {{defense system}} of the skin {{prevents}} cell damage induced by free radicals. Dietary intake of antioxidants {{is important for the}} maintenance of this defense system. This study focusses on the effect of dietary supplementation on the radical scavenging activity in the human skin. The Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy is evaluated as an in-vivo measurement method. The Raman resonance spectroscopy is a valid method. Methods:	In clinical studies (including the following study) and at a public exhibition 151 volunteers were measured with Raman spectroscopy and answered a cross-sectional survey. A statistical analysis was performed. In a clinical study 44 healthy volunteers aged between 20 and 57 years were administered with a dietary supplement for 28 days twice daily. Each group consisted of 11 volunteers; placebo (<b>dextrose</b> <b>powder),</b> low dose vitamin C (125 mg Vitamin C/day), Aronia 800 mg Aronia and 40 mg vitamin C/day) or high dose vitamin C (225 mg vitamin C/day). The Aronia supplement and the low dose vitamin C supplement had shown the same radical scavenging activity in a pre-clinical in-vitro investigation. The radical scavenging activity was tested with a defined amount of a test radical. The resulting parameter is called the Radical Protection Factor (RPF). In this investigation the high dose vitamin C supplement is 1. 8 times more effective. At baseline and after 28 days of oral supplementation measurements were performed using Raman spectroscopy and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy. Nine volunteers of the low dose vitamin C group were additionally measured after 14 days. All volunteers took part in a survey {{at the time of the}} measurements. Results:	After 28 days of oral supplementation with vitamin C and the Aronia supplement the radical scavenging activity of the skin measured by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy had increased significantly by 22 % and 23 %, respectively. The high dose vitamin C group showed a significant median increase by 37 %. Within the low dose vitamin C group the effect is already seen after 14 days of supplementation. There was no significant enhancement of the carotenoid levels. In the cross-sectional investigations the amount of carotenoids in human skin showed to be dependent on gender, age and smoking habits. Women, non-smokers and volunteers below 40 years of age show higher carotenoid concentrations. Conclusion:		Using the EPR spectroscopy it could be shown that both the natural Aronia/vitamin C mixture and the pure synthetic vitamin C supplement equally enhanced the radical scavenging activity of the skin. In this study the RPF showed to be suitable parameter of radical scavenging activity in-vitro. A significant enhancement of carotenoid levels was not observed. The study period had been too short to determine long-term effects...|$|R
