The discussion fixes on three objects located within the park which play an important role in the representation of the site’s past despite being labelled as ‘noncontributing’ in the site’s National Historic Landmark’s nomination. The biographies of a bronze bell, a granite monument, and a group of wax mannequins as sketched out here suggest novel ways to be sensitive to the many and often unexpected contributions brought by the materiality of an object in practices of remembrance. ...|$|R

The second part looks into the probability <b>of</b> <b>detention</b> across several <b>port</b> state control regimes while the third part looks at the effect of inspections on casualties as well as the evaluation of target factors. Using binary logistic regression, a method can be established that visualizes the differences <b>of</b> <b>port</b> state control inspections across several regimes.
