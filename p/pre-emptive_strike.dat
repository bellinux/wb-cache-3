5|$|Experienced and well-trained, 69 Squadron {{nevertheless}} {{entered the}} Yom Kippur War unready for the challenges {{brought about by}} start of the war. Prior to the outbreak of war, the IAF had been preparing for a <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>strike</b> against Egyptian and Syrian positions, but this {{was rejected by the}} Israeli government. 69 Squadron aircraft {{were in the process of}} re-armament to the air-to-air role when hostilities began at 14:00 on October 6, 1973. The aircraft were scrambled to perform CAPs, some having to dump their bomb loads in the Mediterranean, yet no aerial opposition was encountered. The squadron flew 37 sorties on the first day of the war, of which only 4 were strike missions, while two aircraft suffered damage from SA-7s over the Golan Heights.|$|E
5|$|The Netherlands and Belgium {{wished to}} remain neutral {{and refused to}} allow the RAF to {{establish}} bases, to fly deeper into Germany. They also forbade overflying by British bombers to and from Germany. After the outbreak of war, the French refused to allow RAF bombers to bomb German cities from French airfields. The French felt secure behind the Maginot Line, but their air force did not possess the modern bombers to deliver a <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>strike</b> against the Luftwaffe. French fighter forces were not yet ready for an all out defensive campaign against the Germans either. A fear of retaliation was the main French reason. The only recourse was to fly missions directly from Britain and only ports or coastal cities in northern Germany were within easy reach. This state of affairs suited the British, in particular, the Admiralty.|$|E
40|$|Having soberly {{reflected}} {{upon the}} tragedy of September 11, 2001, the author observed that though international law and treaties restrict pre-emptive war, they do allow for war in self-defense. Consequently, some powerful nations have used this as a justification for launching <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>strikes.</b> The threats posed by the powerful nations using self-defense as a justification for <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>strikes</b> and the inability of weaker nations to do the same, greatly account for the unprecedented explosion of global terrorism. The author thinks that confronting terrorism therefore requires a pro-pacifist ethical framework whose principles have to be applied with international law to narrow the legitimacy of self-defense wars. Hence, he proposes "Moral Consistency" as a required condition for launching <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>strikes</b> with two main aims - to reduce violent conflicts and to draw a substantial distinction between reason and justification, and between crime and criminal justice...|$|R

5|$|The Byzantines {{were unable}} to respond {{effectively}} to the Muslim advance in Africa, because the two decades between 695 and 715 were a period of great domestic turmoil. They did react with raids of their own in the East, {{such as the one}} in 709 against Egypt which captured the local admiral, but they also were aware of a coming onslaught: as Caliph al-Walid I (705–715) readied his forces for a renewed assault against Constantinople, Emperor Anastasios II (713–715) prepared the capital, and mounted an unsuccessful <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>strike</b> against the Muslim naval preparations. Anastasios was soon overthrown by Theodosius III (715–717), who in turn was replaced, just as the Muslim army was advancing through Anatolia, by Leo III the Isaurian (717–741). It was Leo III who faced the second and final Arab siege of Constantinople. The use of Greek fire, which devastated the Arab fleet, was again instrumental in the Byzantine victory, while a harsh winter and Bulgar attacks further sapped the besiegers' strength.|$|E

25|$|One radical {{requirement}} of the proposed aircraft was the ability {{for it to be}} operated from straight stretches of rural highways only 500 meters long; this was considered critical to reducing the vulnerability to attack {{in the event of a}} <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>strike</b> upon the nation through the dispersal of aircraft from established airbases to more austere improvised landing strips. In order to enable such operations, this imposed several critical demands upon the design, including a modest landing speed, no-flare touchdown, powerful post-landing deceleration, accurate steering even in crosswinds on icy surfaces, and high acceleration on take-off.|$|E
25|$|Viktor Suvorov {{suggested}} that Stalin had made aggressive preparations {{beginning in the}} late 1930s and was preparing to invade Germany in the summer 1941. He believes that Hitler forestalled Stalin and the German invasion was in essence a <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>strike,</b> precisely as Hitler claimed. This theory was supported by Igor Bunich, Joachim Hoffmann, Mikhail Meltyukhov (see Stalin's Missed Chance) and Edvard Radzinsky (see Stalin: The First In-Depth Biography Based on Explosive New Documents from Russia's Secret Archives). Other historians, especially Gabriel Gorodetsky and David Glantz, reject this thesis. General Fedor von Boch's diary says that the Abwehr fully expected a Soviet attack against German forces in Poland no later than 1942.|$|E
25|$|With {{evidence}} of growing Franco-Spanish co-operation, Pitt suggested {{it was only}} a matter of time before Spain entered the war. The prospect of war with Spain shattered the cabinet unity which had existed up to that point. Pitt strongly advocated a <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>strike</b> which would allow them to capture the annual plate fleet, denying Spain of its vital resources of wealth which were shipped in. The rest of the cabinet refused, and Pitt resigned. In spite of this war with Spain swiftly became unavoidable, and on 4 January 1762 Britain duly declared war on Spain. Almost immediately, British ships under Admiral Charles Saunders moved to blockade Cadiz one of the most important Spanish naval bases.|$|E

However this was rebuffed when Britain and France co-operated to prevent this during the years 1871 – 1878 ending in Britain supporting French influence in Tunisia in exchange for dominion over Cyprus. France still had the issue of Italian influence (related to the huge colony of Tunisian Italians emigrated to Tunisia) and thus decided to find an excuse for a <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>strike.</b> Using the pretext of a Tunisian incursion into Algeria, France invaded with an army of about 36,000 which quickly advanced to Tunis and forced the Bey to make terms {{in the form of}} the 1881 Treaty of Bardo (Al Qasr as Sa'id), which gave France control of Tunisian governance and making it a de facto French protectorate.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year marked a watershed {{in the history}} for the Kingdom of the Isles with the successive deaths of David and Óláfr. The latter was slain by three Dublin-based sons of his exiled brother, after which these menthe Haraldsonnarpartitioned Mann amongst themselves. Once in control, the chronicle reveals that the Haraldsonnar fortified themselves against forces loyal to the kingdom's legitimate heir by launching a <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>strike</b> against Fergus. Although the invasion of Galloway was repulsed with heavy casualties, once the Haraldsonnar returned to Mann the chronicle records that they slaughtered and expelled all resident Gallovidians that they could find. This ruthless reaction evidently reveals an attempt to uproot local factions adhering to Affraic and her son. Whatever the case, within months of his father's assassination, Guðrøðr executed his vengeance. Enstrengthened with Norwegian military support, Guðrøðr overcame his three kin-slaying cousins, and successfully secured the kingship for himself.|$|E

40|$|No-fly Zones {{have been}} used in three recent conflicts. For every {{intervention}} the time taken to achieve the end-state has decreased. It took twelve years in Iraq, three years in Bosnia and only nine months in Libya. NATO was part of the intervention in both Bosnia and Libya, facing almost the same size of opponent, but it took them four times longer to achieve the end-state in Bosnia compared to Libya.   The purpose of this essay is to analyze this difference in the time taken to achieve the end-state with a structured focused comparison of Bosnia and Libya based on Robert Pape´s theory of coercion with a focus on No-fly Zones.   The results show that the mandate can explain the difference. In Libya NATO had the opportunity, due to the mandate, to use <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>strikes,</b> which they did not have in Bosnia. The lack of a mandate to use <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>strikes</b> in Bosnia made it impossible for NATO to put their threats into effect, which is one explanation why it took four times longer to achieve the end-state in Bosnia. ...|$|R
25|$|Just as importantly, only {{a limited}} section of the PAF's strike {{capability}} was employed during Operation Chengiz Khan. Also, compared to the Israeli Air Force's preparation for airstrikes against Egyptians (the Israeli pilots had flown against replicas {{of the most important}} Arab airfields) and the use of specific armaments, the PAF had been limited by servicability before the USA supplied spare parts in March of the year and training was limited if any. Constraints of the fledgling Pakistani economy also meant the development of its military could not be supported. The Pakistani Air Force thus lacked ammunition for effective runway denial. East Pakistani personnel of the PAF who defected may have revealed some of the plans, and it appears that IAF was expecting a <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>strike</b> against its forward airfields. A large-scale offensive was therefore doomed to fail, likely to cause heavy losses and bring the PAF in a position where it could never seriously challenge IAF operations.|$|E
25|$|On October 6, 1973, {{with war}} imminent, the IAF began {{preparing}} for a <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>strike</b> against Egyptian and Syrian airfields and anti-aircraft positions. The Israeli government, however, decided against pre-emption. IAF aircraft were therefore {{in the process of}} re-armament to the air-to-air role when Yom Kippur War hostilities began at 14:00. The next morning begun with Operation Tagar, a SEAD offensive against Egyptian air defences, beginning with strikes against Egyptian air bases. Tagar, however, was quickly discontinued when the dire situation on the Golan Heights became apparent. IAF efforts were redirected north, where the ill-fated Operation Doogman 5 was carried out. Flying with outdated intelligence and no electronic screening against mobile SAM batteries and heavy flak, 6 IAF Phantoms were lost. The sustained campaign required to defeat enemy air defences was abandoned in the face of Egyptian and Syrian advances and the IAF was forced to operate under the SAM threat. Nevertheless, the close air support it provided allowed Israeli troops on the ground to stem the tide and eventually go on the offensive, first in the north and later in the south.|$|E
25|$|Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had {{concluded}} that instead of taking in millions of refugees, it was economical {{to go to war}} against Pakistan. As early as 28 April 1971, the Indian Cabinet had asked General Manekshaw (Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee) to “Go into East Pakistan”. Hostile relations in the past between India and Pakistan added to India's decision to intervene in Pakistan's civil war. Resultantly, the Indian government decided to support the creation of a separate state for ethnic Bengalis by supporting the Mukti Bahini. For this, RAW, helped to organise, train and arm these insurgents. Consequently, the Mukti Bahini succeeded in harassing Pakistani military in East Pakistan, thus creating conditions conducive for a full-scale Indian military intervention in early December. Thus, wary of the growing involvement of India, the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) launched a <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>strike</b> on Indian Air Force bases on 3 December 1971. The attack was modelled on the Israeli Air Force's Operation Focus during the Six-Day War, and intended to neutralise the Indian Air Force planes on the ground. The strike was seen by India as an open act of unprovoked aggression. This marked the official start of the Indo-Pakistani War.|$|E
