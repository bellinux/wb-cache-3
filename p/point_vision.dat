This paper investigates possibilities to improve structure filter performance for a certain class of stochastic perspective systems by utilizing mutual in-formation, in particular when each observed point on a rigid object {{is affected by the}} same process noise. After presenting the dynamic system of interest, the method is applied, using an extended Kalman filter for the estimation, to a simulated time-varying multiple <b>point</b> <b>vision</b> system. The performance of a connected filter is compared, using Monte Carlo methods, to that of a set of independent filters. The idea is then further illustrated and analyzed by means of a simple linear system. Finally more formal stochas-tic differential equation aspects, especially the impact of transformations in the Ito ̂ sense, are discussed and related to physically realistic noise models in vision systems. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{contribution}} of ventral stream {{information to the}} variability of movement {{has been the focus}} of much attention, and has provided numerous researchers with conflicting results. These results have been obtained through the use of discrete pointing movements, and as such, do not offer any explanation regarding how ventral stream information contributes to movement variability over time. The present study examined the {{contribution of}} ventral stream information to movement variability in three tasks: Hand-only movement, eye-only movement, and an eye-hand coordinated task. Participants performed a continuous reciprocal tapping task to two point-of-light targets for 10 seconds. The targets were visible for the first five seconds, at which <b>point</b> <b>vision</b> of both the targets and the limb was occluded by liquid crystal goggles. Movement variability was similar in all conditions for the initial 5 -second interval. The no-vision condition (final 5 -seconds) can be summarized as follows: Ventral stream information contributed to an initial significant increase in variability across motor systems, though the different motor systems were able to preserve ventral information integrity differently. The results of these studies can be attributed to the behavioural and cognitive mechanisms that underlie the saccadic and manual motor systems...|$|E

In this placebo controlled, double blind, randomised study mean peptone stimulated gastric acid secretion (mean +/- SEM) of 10 male healthy subjects (58 +/- 6 mmol H+/ 3 h for placebo) was significantly and dose dependently inhibited by oral telenzepine (2 mg: 31 +/- 5, 3 mg: 23 +/- 5, 5 mg: 21 +/- 4 mmol H+/ 3 h). Telenzepine 3 and 5 mg were significantly stronger than pirenzepine 50 mg orally (37 +/- 8 mmol H+/ 3 h). Mean percentage acid inhibition was 37 % for pirenzepine, and 48, 61, and 64 % for 2, 3, and 5 mg telenzepine, respectively. Basal and peptone stimulated gastrin release was unaffected. Mean salivary output per three hours declined moderately from 156 +/- 45 g (placebo) to 136 +/- 45 g with pirenzepine and significantly to 88 +/- 28 g, 95 +/- 39 g and 39 +/- 13 g with telenzepine 2, 3, and 5 mg, respectively.

The constraints arising from parallel and orthogonal lines and planes can be efficiently exploited at various stages of vision processing pipeline. In this paper we propose an approach for estimation of vanishing points by exploiting the constraints of structured man-made environments, {{where the majority of}} lines is aligned with the principal orthogonal directions of the world coordinate frame. We combine efficient image processing techniques used in the line detection and initialization stage with simultaneous grouping and estimation of vanishing directions using expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Since we assume uncalibrated camera the estimated vanishing points can be used towards partial camera calibration and estimation of the relative orientation of the camera with respect to the scene. The presented approach is computationally efficient and has been verified extensively by experiments.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} a flexible approach {{for determining the}} relative orientation of the camera {{with respect to the}} scene. The main premise of the approach is the fact that in man-made environments, the majority of lines is aligned with the principal orthogonal directions of the world coordinate frame. We exploit this observation towards efficient detection and estimation of vanishing points, which provide strong constraints on camera parameters and relative orientation of the camera with respect to the scene. By combining efficient image processing techniques in the line detection and initialization stage we demonstrate that simultaneous grouping and estimation of vanishing directions can be achieved in the absence of internal parameters of the camera. Constraints between vanishing points are then used for partial calibration and relative rotation estimation. The algorithm has been tested in a variety of indoors and outdoors scenes and its efficiency and automation makes it amenable for implementation on robotic platforms.

Although fused images include various pictorial features, effects of pictorial depth cues have never been systematically investigated in da Vinci stereopsis. To examine this, we created stereograms consisting of a monocular bar flanked by binocular bars with a fixed large horizontal separation, in which the monocular bar induced a subjective occluding edge. Manipulating vertical size or contrast of the bars could affect {{the depth of the}} monocular bar. Conflicting these cues revealed that the effect of vertical size was stronger than that of contrast in all our subjects. Measurements of the depth indicated that the relative vertical size of the bars quantitatively determined the perceived depth, of which levels had large inter-subject differences. All these experiments indicate that the visual system can use the pictorial depth cues as a constraint to determine the depth of monocular elements...|$|R
