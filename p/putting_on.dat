5|$|At the time, {{animals in}} zoos were {{typically}} held in poor conditions in small, cramped cages, and the Zoological Gardens presented no exception.

Brown had scored his last 100 runs in less than 90 minutes. Australia went on to score 721 runs on the first day, the highest number of runs amassed in one day of first-class cricket, before completing victory by an innings and 451 runs, their largest winning margin for the tour.

5|$|England batted {{first and}} their openers {{immediately}} seized the initiative, <b>putting</b> <b>on</b> 234 {{for the first}} wicket in four hours. The tourists made 488 and Booth scored eight as Australia replied with 221 and were forced to follow on. He made 27 in the second innings before being bowled by David Allen as the hosts fell to an innings defeat. It was Australia's biggest defeat at home since the Fourth Test of the 1911–12 Ashes series when they lost by an innings and 225 runs.

5|$|However, in 1951–52, Barnes made {{a return}} to cricket, and sought {{selection}} in the national team to play the West Indies during the 1951–52 Australian season.

Australia's batsmen struggled in the first two Tests, and before the Third Test, Barnes scored 107 against Victoria, <b>putting</b> <b>on</b> 210 in partnership with Morris for New South Wales. The Sporting Globe in Melbourne had presciently predicted that the board would object if the selectors chose Barnes.|$|E
5|$|In response, Bangladesh lost Tamim Iqbal for a duck in {{the first}} over, giving debutant Ajmal Shahzad his first ODI wicket from his third ball of the match. Bresnan removed the other Bangladeshi opener in the 10th over, {{the first of his}} four wickets in the match. This wicket brought {{together}} Mushfiqur Rahim and Aftab Ahmed, who both played aggressively, <b>putting</b> <b>on</b> 56 together in the next ten overs, but when Aftab Ahmed was run out looking for a non-existent run, Bangladesh started to struggle. Rahim and Shakib Al Hasan both fell after making good starts and the required run rate started to rise, making a Bangladeshi victory look improbable. Slow scoring between Naeem Islam and Mahmudullah took victory further away, and Bangladesh eventually finished 45 runs short of their target, granting England a series whitewash.|$|E
