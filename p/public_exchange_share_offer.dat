Hemen Holding (a company {{indirectly}} controlled by the largest shareholder and chairman of Frontline, John Fredriksen) became the largest shareholder of Frontline in 1996. In May 1997, a decision was made at the general meeting in Frontline AB to change its domicile from Sweden to Bermuda and to list its shares on the Oslo Stock Exchange.

50|$|With the {{introduction}} of paid football in Denmark by the Danish Football Association in 1978, the club split into an amateur and a professional department. The amateurs consisted of the various youth departments which had been the trademark of the club since the 1964 merger, {{as well as the}} numerous volunteers who service every match of the professional club for free. In 1987 the professional department, Brøndby IF Fodbold A/S, was the second football club in the world (with Tottenham Hotspur being the first) to float its shares on a <b>public</b> stock <b>exchange.</b> The <b>shares</b> were divided in A and B shares of equal value, with only the B shares for sale to the public. Each A share counts for ten votes and each B share counts for a single ownership vote, and the A shares were divided between three groups to prevent hostile takeovers; the volunteer amateur leaders of the club, the main sponsors of the club, and the company Euro Sportsholding, owned by Brøndby IF itself. The A shares accounted for 64% of the votes, and thereby the power in the club.|$|R

5000|$|Private <b>exchanges</b> and <b>public</b> <b>exchanges,</b> {{also known}} as <b>public</b> health {{insurance}} <b>exchanges,</b> both enable the purchase of benefits through an online marketplace. However, private exchanges are offered by employers for use by active and/or retired employees and include health insurance {{and other types of}} benefits. <b>Public</b> <b>exchanges,</b> on the other hand, were established under the Affordable Care Act to give individuals the opportunity to purchase health insurance, often with a government subsidy if eligible. Private exchanges are operated by private entities such as brokers, carriers and technology companies, while <b>public</b> <b>exchanges</b> are operated by individual states or the federal government or via a federal/state partnership. Finally, private exchanges typically offer varying degrees of decision support, or ways to guide employees through the benefits selection process, through education and system recommendations. Private exchanges may be accessed by employees throughout the year to review their benefits or make qualifying changes to their coverage, whereas <b>public</b> <b>exchanges</b> currently lack decision support and can only be accessed for Open Enrollment except {{in the case of a}} qualifying event.|$|R

The regression and correlation techniques were used to establish the relationship. The dependent variable was the Dar es Salaam Stock <b>Exchange</b> All <b>Shares</b> Index while <b>Exchange</b> rate and Market capitalisation, were independent variables of regression. The results show that the Exchange rate and the Dar es Salaam Stock <b>Exchange</b> All <b>Shares</b> Index have positive regression coefficient, Market capitalisation and Dar es Salaam Stock <b>Exchange</b> All <b>Shares</b> Index also have positive regression coefficient. Also these three variables were found to have positive correlation coefficients.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{structure}} of markets when traders are {{given the opportunity to}} create their own market, as on the internet. On the internet, <b>public</b> <b>exchanges</b> have in many cases been replaced by private exchanges. We use experiments to investigate possible reasons for the failure of <b>public</b> <b>exchanges.</b> In our experimental markets, when traders make an offer, they decide whom to inform about the offer. Participants typically inform all traders {{on the other side of}} the market, but not on their own side, resulting in a private, not a <b>public</b> <b>exchange.</b> This private exchange leads to the same outcomes in terms of prices and efficiency as a double auction. When we impose transaction costs on the buyers, only the sellers make private offers, which results in an inefficient market. When we provide incentives for sellers to inform each other, most of the sellers reveal a strict preference to hide offers from rivals. However, when sellers do share price information, they attain a higher price and benefit collectively. ...|$|R
