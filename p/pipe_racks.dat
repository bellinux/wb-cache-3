6000|$|High up {{in a third}} flat in Howe Street one, Thomas Dimsdale, {{was going}} through his period of {{probation}} in a little bedroom and a large sitting-room, which latter, [...] "more studentium," [...] served the purpose of dining-room, parlour, and study. A dingy sideboard, with four still more dingy chairs and an archaeological sofa, made up {{the whole of the}} furniture, {{with the exception of a}} circular mahogany centre-table, littered with note-books and papers. Above the mantelpiece was a fly-blown mirror with innumerable cards and notices projecting in a fringe all around, and a pair of <b>pipe</b> <b>racks</b> flanking it on either side. Along the centre of the side-board, arranged with suspicious neatness, as though seldom disturbed, stood a line of solemn books, Holden's Osteology, Quain's Anatomy, Kirkes' Physiology, and Huxley's Invertebrata, together with a disarticulated human skull. On one side of the fireplace two thigh bones were stacked; on the other a pair of foils, two basket-hilted single-sticks, and a set of boxing-gloves. On a shelf in a convenient niche was a small stock of general literature, which appeared to have been considerably more thumbed than the works upon medicine. Thackeray's Esmond and Meredith's Richard Feveret rubbed covers with Irving's Conquest of Granada and a tattered line of paper-covered novels. Over the sideboard was a framed photograph of the Edinburgh University Football Fifteen, and opposite it a smaller one of Dimsdale himself, clad in the scantiest of garb, as he appeared after winning the half-mile at the Inter-University Handicap. A large silver goblet, the trophy of that occasion, stood underneath upon a bracket. Such was the student's chamber upon the morning in question, save that in a roomy arm-chair in the corner the young gentleman himself was languidly reclining, with a short wooden pipe in his mouth, and his feet perched up upon the side of the table.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} aimed at finding the most cost {{effective}} way of executing Modular Execution Strategy (MES) for building <b>pipe</b> <b>racks</b> of a project that an engineering company Fluor B. V. is currently executing in Kuwait. A pipe rack is a steel structure which is constructed to efficiently place and support multiple levels of pipelines for industrial plants such as refinery plants, chemical plants or power plants. The Modular Execution Strategy aims at relocating parts of fabrication and assembly activities of a pipe rack construction to potentially low cost locations at which the conditions for fabrication and assembly activities are more favorable. The pre-assembled <b>pipe</b> <b>racks</b> will be transported to the onshore installation site by a vessel, which results in sea-transport design requirements (due to vessel motions) {{in addition to the}} in-place design. Three options of different configuration for MES were considered. The first option is to transport only upper parts of the <b>pipe</b> <b>racks</b> without their bottom columns and assemble the bottom columns at the installation site. The second option is to transport the complete <b>pipe</b> <b>racks</b> including bottom columns which are stiffened by temporary bracings. The last option is to transport complete <b>pipe</b> <b>racks</b> with strengthened columns having a larger profile dimensions. In order to consider various sizes of <b>pipe</b> <b>racks,</b> 27 -representative configurations of <b>pipe</b> <b>racks</b> of the project were selected. These <b>pipe</b> <b>racks</b> were designed to withstand in-place loadings and sea-transport loadings with a quasi-static analysis method. The in-place loadings are weight of pipe lines and wind force. The sea-transport loadings are forces due to motions of a vessel and critical sea-transport loadings come from roll + heave and pitch + heave. Quantities of steel for each option were found after completion of the design. Subsequently, the quantities were translated into steel work cost which includes procurement, fabrication, assembly and installation costs of steel work. As a conclusion, it was found that considering the quantities and costs of steel work for the project, option 1 (transport the <b>pipe</b> <b>racks</b> without columns) is the most cost effective solution. If pinned supports are used at the vessel deck, which are more favorable for the company, it was calculated that option 1 requires, on average, 15 % and 30 % less cost than option 2 and option 3 respectively. For clamped supported conditions, option 1 still requires 15 % less cost than both option 2 and option 3. Furthermore, it was demonstrated by performing a resonance check and a dynamic analysis for a tall two-dimensional frame, that a quasi-static analysis method could be used to assess the sea-transport loadings. It was found that there is very low possibility of resonance and only low dynamic amplification. In this thesis, the focus has been on differences in the structural configurations. Other aspects, some of which may be difficult to express in cost terms such as logistical difficulty, safety/risk, and project schedule, were not taken into account. Therefore, in order to verify the attractiveness of each option in more detail, it is suggested to also make a complete assessment of those mentioned aspects. <br/...|$|E
40|$|<b>Pipe</b> <b>racks</b> are {{steel frame}} {{structures}} {{used to support}} piping, cables, trays etc. at oil and gas facilities onshore and offshore. <b>Pipe</b> <b>racks</b> may vary in design but thefundamental principals are the same. The geometry is therefore suitable for automate design. The main goal of this thesis was to establish a geometric foundation for onshorepipe rack implementation in knowledge based engineering (KBE) design. Loadsand geometry is based on models and design briefs from the onshore Ormen Langefacility at Nyhamna, Norway and Eurocodes for steel structures. Four heights, three widths, three lengths and two support conditions are combinedto make the models presented in this work. These parameters are chosen basedon observations of existing onshore <b>pipe</b> <b>racks</b> and specifications from the provideddesign briefs. Combined with 11 load cases these parameters results {{in a total of}} 36 analyses. All structures have been designed according to ultimate limit state (ULS), accidental limit state (ALS) and service ability limit state (SLS) design codes, where it is placed emphasis on ULS design codes. The results from this work is found in appendix D. Profile types have been chosen based on both geometric properties and capacity,where the geometric properties are governed by a design hierarchy. All calculations and assumptions are {{based on the fact that}} this is an early stagedesign. Results from the work carried out in this assignment is hence not a finalproduct.

40|$|Laterally {{unsupported}} steel frames commonly {{occur in}} industrial structures and <b>pipe</b> <b>racks.</b> In these applications, frames are typically unsupported in the lateral direction at the beam to column junctions, a key difference from typical details in commercial applications. Present design procedures in structural steel standards {{are not intended}} {{for the design of}} these types of structures. It is thus of interest to develop analysis and design tools for such structures that are reliable, systematic, and simple enough to be implemented in structural analysis software and used in design offices. Towards this goal, this doctoral thesis contributes to two aspects of importance to the lateral torsional buckling analysis of laterally unsupported plane frames: (a) the incorporation of shear deformation effects in the buckling analysis of thin walled members, and (b) the quantification and modelling of partial warping restraints provided by moment connections in typical moment resisting plane frames to adjoining beams and columns. The theory and finite element developed under item (a) deviate from conventional theories in three respects: 1) It is based on general non-orthogonal coordinates, which makes it particularly suited for the effective modeling of members with eccentric supports (i. e., supports that do not coincide with the location of the shear centre; 2) It captures shear deformation effects due to bending and warping; 3) It incorporates the effect of load position relative to the shear centre. A new variational principle for the problem is developed from first principle. The variational principle is used to formulate the governing differential equations for thin-walled members based on the principle of stationary total potential energy. The closed form solutions of the resulting field equations and boundary conditions are developed for the cases of column flexural buckling, column torsional buckling, and lateral torsional buckling of beams under uniform moments, and comparisons to classical solutions were conducted. A finite element is then developed for more general cases of loading schemes and boundary conditions and compared to predictions based on classical solutions and general finite element analysis results undertaken. In all cases examined, the present solution provides buckling resistance predictions lower than those based on the classical solution that do not include the effect of shear deformation. Shear deformation effects are found negligible when predicting buckling resistances for columns of typical geometries, but it can be significant when predicting the buckling resistance of beams under high moment gradients. Towards item (b), a formulation of the partial warping restraint provided by common moment connections to adjoining members is developed based on a shell formulation. The finite element developed is designed to interface with other collinear elements such as that developed under task (a), to accurately and efficiently predict the lateral buckling resistance of moment resisting plane frames. Comparisons between the predictions based on the present formulation and those based on established shell finite element analysis illustrate the ability of the model to efficiently and reliably predict the lateral buckling resistance of laterally unsupported frames...|$|E

40|$|An {{explosion}} on {{a typical}} offshore installation is a critical, however rare accidental event which may result in damage and loss of property, and in the worse case loss of lives. Top-side sections on an offshore installation which are exposed to an explosion blast should be designed to withstand such an event {{in a way that}} further escalation of the damage on personnel or property is avoided. There is however limited information on the modeling and analysis procedures for dealing with such events, and most classification rules on this subject give limited information and guidelines on the practical implementation of such effects for general analysis purposes. This thesis has been an investigation on these matters. The basis of this Master thesis has been on a <b>pipe</b> <b>rack</b> structure from one of Aker Solutions' top-side projects. It has been assumed that this structure is exposed to an accidental hydrocarbon explosion, and the resulting structural response has been investigated. A parameter study has been performed by varying blast load levels and durations. The effects due to the weight of the piping on the structure have also been studied. The main task of this thesis has been to compare simplified, static analysis models against dynamic analysis models as to calculate dynamic amplification factors (DAF), the purpose of this is to better understand the dynamic behavior of the structure due to the blast loading. The intention is that the dynamic amplification factors are to be used further by the engineers at Aker Solutions for dimensioning and designing of similar structures. Results showed that the blast loads as used in the analyses did not cause any structural responses within the material's plastic range. Further on, {{it was found that the}} magnitude of dynamic amplification is depending on both the blast duration emph{and} the weight of the pipes on the <b>pipe</b> <b>rack.</b> Typical results indicated that this dynamic amplification was reduced with increased blast duration...|$|R
