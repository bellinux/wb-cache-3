40|$|Inverted-repeated or <b>palindromic</b> <b>sequences</b> {{have been}} found to occur in both prokaryotic and {{eukaryotic}} genomes. Such repeated sequences are usually short and present at several functionally important regions in the genome. However, long <b>palindromic</b> <b>sequences</b> are rare and are a major source of genomic instability. The palindrome-mediated genomic instability is believed to be due to cruciform or hairpin formation and subse-quent cleavage of this structure by structure-specific nucleases. Here we present both genetic and physical evidence that long <b>palindromic</b> <b>sequences</b> (> 50 bp) generate double-strand breaks (DSBs) at a high frequency during meiosis in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The palindrome-mediated DSB formation depends on the primary sequence of the inverted repeat and the location and length of the repeated units. The DSB formation at the palindrome requires all of the gene products that are known to be responsible for DSB formation at the normal meiosis-specific sites. Since DSBs are initiators of nearly all meiotic recombination events, most of the palindrome-induced breaks appear to be repaired by homologous recombination. Our results suggest that short <b>palindromic</b> <b>sequences</b> are highly stable in vivo. In contrast, long <b>palindromic</b> <b>sequences</b> make the genome unstable by inducing DSBs and such sequences are usually removed from the genome by homologous recombination events.

50|$|A <b>palindromic</b> <b>{{sequence}}</b> is a {{nucleic acid}} sequence on double-stranded DNA or RNA wherein reading 5' (five-prime) to 3' (three prime) forward on one strand matches the sequence reading 5' to 3' on the complementary strand with which it forms a double helix. This definition of palindrome thus depends on complementary strands being palindromic of each other.|$|E

In Escherichia coli, adenine methylation is catalyzed by the adenine methyltransferase Dam (DNA adenine methyltransferase), which catalyses adenine methylation exclusively in the <b>palindromic</b> <b>sequence</b> GATC. Ectopic expression of Dam in eukaryotic cells leads to methylation of adenine in GATC sequences without any other noticeable side effect.|$|E
40|$|Chromosomal rearrangements play a {{major role}} in the {{evolution}} of eukaryotic genomes. Genomic aberrations are also a hallmark of many tumors and are associated with a number of hereditary diseases in humans. The presence of repetitive sequences that can adopt non-canonical DNA structures is one of the factors which can predispose chromosomal regions where they reside to instability. <b>Palindromic</b> <b>sequences</b> (inverted repeats with or without a unique sequence between them) that can adopt hairpin or cruciform structures are frequently found in regions that are prone for gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs) in somatic and germ cells in different organisms. Direct physical evidence was obtained that double-strand breaks (DSBs) occur at the location of long inverted repeats, a triggering event for the genomic instability. However, the mechanisms by which <b>palindromic</b> <b>sequences</b> lead to chromosomal fragility are largely unknown.

Canonical Helitrons typically begin with a 5′ T (C/T) and terminate with the nucleotides CTRR (most frequently CTAG, but occasionally variation has been noted) but do not contain terminal inverted repeats. In addition, they frequently have a short <b>palindromic</b> <b>sequence</b> (16 to 20 nucleotides) hairpin about ∼ 11 bp from the 3′ end. They integrate between an AT host dinucleotide. Some families of Helitrons also carry tandem repeats, like microsatellites and minisatellites which are generally highly mutable sequences.|$|E
50|$|The next step, {{the strand}} {{transfer}} reaction, takes place inside the host cell nucleus and involves the critical step of inserting the HIV DNA into a selected {{region of the}} host DNA. The region of insertion contains a weakly conserved <b>palindromic</b> <b>sequence.</b> This strand transfer reaction is initiated as the HIV integrase catalyzes the HIV DNA 3’-hydroxyl group attack on the host DNA. The attack by the HIV DNA occurs on opposite strands of the host DNA in a staggered fashion, typically 4-6 base pairs apart. This reaction leads to separation of the bonds in the host DNA base pairs located between the staggered cuts, and the joining of the HIV 3’-hydroxyl groups with the host DNA 5’ phosphate ends. At this point, the newly joined viral-host DNA region unfolds.|$|E

The P. putida KT2440 chromosome is characterized by strand symmetry and intrastrand parity of complementary oligonucleotides. Each tetranucleotide occurs with similar frequency on the two strands. Tetranucleotide usage is biased by G+C content and physicochemical constraints such as base stacking energy, dinucleotide propeller twist angle, or trinucleotide bendability. The 105 regions with atypical oligonucleotide composition can be differentiated by their patterns of oligonucleotide usage into categories of horizontally acquired gene islands, multidomain genes or ancient regions such as genes for ribosomal proteins and RNAs.

A correlation of recombination breakpoints with direct repeats was not observed. This suggests that gene conversion is promoted by <b>palindromic</b> <b>sequences...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} for deletion mutations whose formation is mediated by palindromic and quasipalindromic DNA sequences. It proposes that the self-complementarity of palindromes allows {{the formation of}} DNA secondary structures that serve as deletion intermediates. The structures juxtapose the end points of the deletion and thus direct deletion specificity. While misaligned DNA intermediates that explain deletion termini occurring in repeated DNA sequences have been described, no explanations have been offered for deletion termini occurring in other sequences. The DNA secondary structures whose formation is mediated by <b>palindromic</b> <b>sequences</b> appear to explain many of these. In this paper, secondary-structure intermediates are described {{for a series of}} spontaneous deletions of known sequence in the lacl gene of Escherichia coli. The model is supported by its failure to predict structures that can juxtapose simulated deletion termini in the lacl gene. We have found a strong association between <b>palindromic</b> <b>sequences</b> and repeated sequences at lacl deletion termini that suggests the joint participation of repeated and <b>palindromic</b> DNA <b>sequences</b> in the formation of some deletions. Sequences of deletions in other organisms also suggest the participation of <b>palindromic</b> DNA <b>sequences</b> in the formation of deletions...|$|R
5000|$|C/EBP {{proteins}} {{interact with}} the CCAAT (cytosine-cytosine-adenosine-adenosine-thymidine) box motif, which is present in several gene promoters. They are characterized by a highly conserved basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) domain at the C-terminus. This domain is involved in dimerization and DNA binding, as are other transcription factors of the leucine zipper domain-containing family (c-Fos and c-jun). The bZIP domain structure of C/EBPs is composed of an α-helix that forms a [...] "coiled coil" [...] structure when it dimerizes. Members of the C/EBP family can form homodimers or heterodimers with other C/EBPs and with other transcription factors, {{which may or may}} not contain the leucine zipper domain. The dimerization is necessary to enable C/EBPs to bind specifically to DNA through a <b>palindromic</b> <b>sequence</b> in the major groove of the DNA. C/EBP proteins also contain activation domains at the N-terminus and regulatory domains.|$|E
50|$|The four ends of DNA (two hairpinned coding {{ends and}} the two signal ends) are held {{together}} in a postcleavage complex by the RAG complex. The Artemis:DNA-PKcs complex, along with Ku and DNA ligase IV/XRCC4 dimer, can then close up the signal ends into a 'signal joint'. It also opens the hairpins of the coding ends, and this process {{is thought to be}} mediated by the RAG complex (the RAG complex can open free hairpins by itself, but this is only observed in manganese-containing buffers, and not in magnesium-containing buffers). Nucleotides are added at the open ends by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). This occurs until there are complimentary sequences at which point the opposite strands will pair up. Exonucleases then remove the unpaired nucleotides, and ligases fill in the gaps. This creates a junction between each joined segment, containing an unspecified number of nucleotide additions, flanked by a 2-residue <b>palindromic</b> <b>sequence.</b>|$|E

40|$|Earlier {{work from}} our {{laboratory}} focused on identifying {{regions of the}} genome susceptible to DNA palindrome formation, a rate-limiting step in gene amplification. We described a method to obtain a genome-wide analysis of palindrome formation (GAPF) based on the efficient intrastrand base pairing in large <b>palindromic</b> <b>sequences</b> (1). <b>Palindromic</b> <b>sequences</b> can rapidly anneal intramolecularly to form ‘snap-back’ DNA under conditions that do not favor intermolecular annealing. This snap-back property is used to enrich for <b>palindromic</b> <b>sequences</b> in total genomic DNA by denaturing the DNA at 100 ˚C, rapidly renaturing it by cooling, and then digesting the mixture with the single-strand specific nuclease S 1. Snap-back DNA formed from palindromes is double-stranded and resistant to S 1, whereas the remainder of genomic DNA is single-stranded and thus is sensitive to S 1 digestion. Using GAPF, we have shown that de novo palindromes can form in cancers, and direct molecular analysis validated that a subset of these GAPF-positive signals represent cancer-specific palindromes located at the boundary of gene amplicons (1, 2). We recently discovered that the original GAPF protocol also enriches for differentially methylated DNA (3). We now describe a modification of GAPF to increase the stringency of denaturation using 50 % formamide to make the assay specific for DNA palindromes...|$|R

50|$|The {{complementary}} DNA (cDNA) of the RPSA gene {{is formed}} by the assembly of seven exons, six of which correspond to the coding sequence. The amino acid sequence of RPSA, deduced from the sequence of its cDNA, includes 295 residues. RPSA can be sub-divided in two main domains: an N-domain (residues 1-209), which corresponds to exons 2-5 of the gene, and a C-domain (residues 210-295), which corresponds to exons 6-7. The N-domain of RPSA is homologous to the ribosomal protein S2 (RPS2) of prokaryotes. It contains a <b>palindromic</b> <b>sequence</b> 173LMWWML178 which is conserved in all metazoans. Its C-domain is highly conserved in vertebrates. The amino acid sequence of RPSA is 98% identical in all mammals. RPSA is a ribosomal protein which has acquired the function of laminin receptor during evolution. The structure of the N-domain of RPSA is {{similar to those of}} prokaryotic RPS2. The C-domain is intrinsically disordered in solution. The N-domain is monomeric in solution and unfolds according to a three state equilibrium. The folding intermediate is predominant at 37 °C.|$|E
5000|$|Restriction enzymes are endonucleases from {{eubacteria}} and archaea that {{recognize a}} specific DNA sequence. [...] The nucleotide sequence recognized for cleavage by a restriction enzyme {{is called the}} restriction site. Typically, a restriction site will be a <b>palindromic</b> <b>sequence</b> about four to six nucleotides long. Most restriction endonucleases cleave the DNA strand unevenly, leaving complementary single-stranded ends. These ends can reconnect through hybridization and are termed [...] "sticky ends". Once paired, the phosphodiester bonds of the fragments can be joined by DNA ligase. There are hundreds of restriction endonucleases known, each attacking a different restriction site. The DNA fragments cleaved by the same endonuclease can be joined together regardless {{of the origin of}} the DNA. Such DNA is called recombinant DNA; DNA formed by the joining of genes into new combinations. Restriction endonucleases (restriction enzymes) are divided into three categories, Type I, Type II, and Type III, according to their mechanism of action. These enzymes are often used in genetic engineering to make recombinant DNA for introduction into bacterial, plant, or animal cells, as well as in synthetic biology.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{aspect of}} the CCAAT binding motif is the CCAAT/enhancer binding {{proteins}} (C/EBPs). They are a group of transcription factors of 6 members (α-ζ), which are highly conserved and bind to the CCAAT motif [...] While research on these binding proteins is relatively recent, their function {{has been shown to}} have vital roles in cellular proliferation and differentiation, metabolism, inflammation, and immunity in various cells, but specifically hepatocytes, adipocytes, and hematopoietic cells. [...] For example, in adipocytes, this has been shown in a variety of experiments with mice: ectopic expression of these C/EBPs (C/EBPα and C/EBPβ) were able to initiate the differentiation programs of the cell, {{even in the absence of}} adipogenic hormones, or the differentiation of preadipocytes to adipocytes (or fat cells). In addition, an overabundance of these C/EBPs (specifically, C/EBPδ) causes an accelerated response. And furthermore, in cells lacking C/EBP or in C/EBP-deficient mice, both are unable to undergo adipogenesis. This results in the mice dying from hypoglycemia, or the reduced lipid accumulation in adipose tissue. [...] The C/EBPs follow a general basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) domain at the C-terminus and are able to form dimers with other C/EBP's or other transcription factors. This dimerization allows the C/EBPs to bind specifically to DNA through a <b>palindromic</b> <b>sequence</b> in the major groove of DNA.

40|$|Abstract Background It {{has been}} {{previously}} shown that <b>palindromic</b> <b>sequences</b> are frequently observed in proteins. However, our knowledge about their evolutionary origin and their possible importance is incomplete. Results In this work, we tried to revisit this relatively neglected phenomenon. Several questions are addressed in this work. (1) It is known {{that there is a}} large chance of finding a palindrome in low complexity sequences (i. e. sequences with extreme amino acid usage bias). What is the role of sequence complexity in the evolution of <b>palindromic</b> <b>sequences</b> in proteins? (2) Do palindromes coincide with conserved protein sequences? If yes, what are the functions of these conserved segments? (3) In case of conserved palindromes, is it always the case that the whole conserved pattern is also symmetrical? (4) Do <b>palindromic</b> protein <b>sequences</b> form regular secondary structures? (5) Does sequence similarity of the two "sides" of a palindrome imply structural similarity? For the first question, we showed that the complexity of palindromic peptides is significantly lower than randomly generated palindromes. Therefore, one can say that palindromes occur frequently in low complexity protein segments, without necessarily having a defined function or forming a special structure. Nevertheless, this does not rule out the possibility of finding palindromes which play some roles in protein structure and function. In fact, we found several palindromes that overlap with conserved protein Blocks of different functions. However, in many cases we failed to find any symmetry in the conserved regions of corresponding Blocks. Furthermore, to answer the last two questions, the structural characteristics of palindromes were studied. It is shown that palindromes may have a great propensity to form α-helical structures. Finally, we demonstrated that the two sides of a palindrome generally do not show significant structural similarities. Conclusion We suggest that the puzzling abundance of <b>palindromic</b> <b>sequences</b> in proteins is mainly due to their frequent concurrence with low-complexity protein regions, rather than a global role in the protein function. In addition, <b>palindromic</b> <b>sequences</b> show a relatively high tendency to form helices, which might {{play an important role in}} the evolution of proteins that contain palindromes. Moreover, reverse similarity in peptides does not necessarily imply significant structural similarity. This observation rules out the importance of palindromes for forming symmetrical structures. Although palindromes frequently overlap with conserved Blocks, we suggest that palindromes overlap with Blocks only by coincidence, rather than being involved with a certain structural fold or protein domain. </p...|$|R
