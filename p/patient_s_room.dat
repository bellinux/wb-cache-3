40|$|International audienceHuman face {{perception}} {{requires a}} network of brain regions distributed throughout the occipital and temporal lobes with a right hemisphere advantage. Present theories consider this network as either a processing hierarchy beginning with the inferior occipital gyrus (occipital face area; IOG-faces/OFA) or a multiple-route network with nonhierarchical components. The former predicts that removing IOG-faces/OFA will detrimentally affect downstream stages, whereas the latter does not. We tested this prediction in a human <b>patient</b> (<b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P.) requiring removal of the right inferior occipital cortex, including IOG-faces/OFA. We acquired multiple fMRI measurements in <b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P. before and after a preplanned surgery and multiple measurements in typical controls, enabling both within-subject/across-session comparisons (<b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P. before resection vs <b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P. after resection) and between-subject/across-session comparisons (<b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P. vs controls). We found that the spatial topology and selectivity of downstream ipsilateral face-selective regions were stable 1 and 8 month(s) after surgery. Additionally, the reliability of distributed patterns of face selectivity in <b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P. before versus after resection was not different from across-session reliability in controls. Nevertheless, postoperatively, representations of visual space were typical in dorsal face-selective regions but atypical in ventral face-selective regions and V 1 of the resected hemisphere. Diffusion weighted imaging in <b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P. and controls identifies white matter tracts connecting retinotopic areas to downstream face-selective regions, which {{may contribute to the}} stable and plastic features of the face network in <b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P. after surgery. Together, our results support a multiple-route network of face processing with nonhierarchical components and shed light on stable and plastic features of high-level visual cortex following focal brain damage. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Brain networks consist of interconnected functional regions commonly organized in processing hierarchies. Prevailing theories predict that damage to the input of the hierarchy will detrimentally affect later stages. We tested this prediction with multiple brain measurements in a rare human patient requiring surgical removal of the putative input to a network processing faces. Surprisingly, the spatial topology and selectivity of downstream face-selective regions are stable after surgery. Nevertheless, representations of visual space were typical in dorsal face-selective regions but atypical in ventral face-selective regions and V 1. White matter connections from outside the face network may support these stable and plastic features. As processing hierarchies are ubiquitous in biological and nonbiological systems, our results have pervasive implications for understanding the construction of resilient networks...|$|R

Much evidence {{has shown that}} carbonic anhydrase inhibitors can restrain bone resorption. We had detected increased expression of carbonic anhydrase I (CA 1) in synovium of patients with AS. This study aimed {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} and safety of methazolamide, an anti-carbonic anhydrase drug, for treating patients with AS. Methods: Two <b>patients,</b> called as <b>S</b> and L, were diagnosed with active AS based on BASDAI and BASFI assessments, radiographic data and other clinical indices. They took methazolamide tablets at a dose of 25 mg twice every day. Results : <b>Patient</b> <b>S's</b> BASDAI score fell from 5. 4 to 4. 4, while patient L's BASDAI fell from 2. 4 to 2. <b>Patient</b> <b>S's</b> BASFI score change from 2. 7 to 2. 9, while patient L's BASFI score fell from 1. 2 to 0. 2. The ESR values of <b>patient</b> <b>S</b> were considerably reduced, while the ESR value of patient L remained unchanged and in the normal range. The calcium concentration of <b>patient</b> <b>S</b> decreased from 3. 05 mmol/L to 2. 39 mmol/L. The CT evidence indicates that the articular surfaces of the erosive sacroiliac joints became clearer and the area of the calcium deposits began decreased. No significant systemic side effects were observed in either patient. Conclusions: The above results indicate that methazolamide was effective for active AS. Methazolamide may improve AS symptoms by inhibiting carbonic anhydrase activity during the processes of bone reporption and new bone formation. </p...|$|R

However, the capacity to consent may be impaired or limited for several reasons, and the legal competence to consent may thus not be present. There are several legal requirements which pertain to the <b>patient</b> <b>s</b> capacity to consent. In order to assess the consent such requirements have to be addressed by the responsible healthcare professional, which in most cases will be the doctor. In Norway, however, the legal directions are to some extent rather complex.

Some general questions which might be addressed when assessing decision-making capacity are discussed. Some examples on open issues not clearly solved by the legal guidelines are pointed out, with suggestions on how to solve these. These examples include the assessment of decision-making capacity for persons under guardianship, children, adolescence and adults. The results identify the need for health-care professionals to be sufficiently educated. The need for quality assurance systems in healthcare is also pointed out.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{function}} of conflict prevention performed by keywords and key-expressions within medical consultations. Doctor-patient interaction within medical consultations {{can be interpreted as}} a problem-solving discussion, as it is oriented to the solution of a certain health problem. As such, medical consultations are based on an argumentative discussion, in which, roughly speaking, both parties try to reason together in order to find a solution for the <b>patient</b> <b>s</b> health problem. In this sense, a non-mixed dispute (van Eemeren and Grootendorst 2004) often arises, in which doctor and patient discuss a standpoint, normally advanced by the doctor, about the <b>patient</b> <b>s</b> diagnosis or therapy. Problem-solving, however, is not the only possible interaction scheme (Rigotti and Rocci 2006) that can be involved in doctor-patient consultations. Indeed, other more confrontational interaction schemes are possible, which may also tend to real controversies; these cases are often triggered by the asymmetry of competences and knowledge which is typical of the relationship between doctors and patients. Such situations, of course, affect the quality of the consultation, because the issue at stake ceases to be the <b>patient</b> <b>s</b> health, and becomes the relationship between the patient and the doctor (in terms of trust, reliability, etc.). Ultimately, this may have negative effects on the <b>patient</b> <b>s</b> health and, thus, more in general, may contradict the raison d être of the health system. Thus during the medical consultation conflicts need to be avoided both by doctor and patient. The choice of keywords and key-expressions appears to be a crucial step within a strategy of conflict prevention. In fact, thanks to their close link to the relevant endoxa, their ability to trigger inferences, and their centrality within the argumentative structure of persuasive texts, keywords can be very important tools in the creation of emotive arguments and the prevention of conflict. Relying on examples from real-life consultations, this paper shows how keywords and key-expressions realize this function...|$|R

The aim of our study was to evaluate the prevalence of clinical and subclinical thyroid disorders in <b>patients</b> with <b>S</b> vs gender-matched and age-matched control subjects. METHODS:Thyroid hormones and antithyroid antibodies, thyroid ultrasonography and fine-needle aspiration were performed in 111 <b>patients</b> with <b>S</b> who had been consecutively referred to the Respiratory Pathophysiology Section of the University of Pisa, and the results were compared to 333 gender-matched and age-matched control subjects from the same geographic area. RESULTS:The odds ratio for subclinical hypothyroidism for female <b>patients</b> with <b>S</b> vs control subjects was 2. 7 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 3 to 5. 9); for anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody titer (AbTPO) positivity, 2. 2 (95 % CI, 1. 2 to 3. 9); and for thyroid autoimmunity, 1. 9 (95 % CI, 1. 1 to 3. 2). The mean values of thyroid-stimulating hormone and AbTPO were higher in female <b>S</b> <b>patients</b> than in control subjects (p < 0. 01). A significantly higher prevalence of clinical hypothyroidism (four patients) and Graves disease (three patients) was observed in female <b>S</b> <b>patients</b> than in control subjects (none; p = 0. 005 and 0. 0026, respectively).
