50|$|In the OSI model, {{communicating}} {{systems are}} assumed to be connected by an underlying physical medium providing a basic (and unspecified) transmission mechanism. The layers above it are numbered (from one to seven); the nth layer is referred to as (n)-layer. Each layer provides service to the layer above it (or at the top to the application process) using the services of the layer immediately below it. The layers communicate with each other by means of an interface, called a service access point. Corresponding layers at each system are called <b>peer</b> <b>entities.</b> To communicate, two <b>peer</b> <b>entities</b> at a given layer use an (n)-protocol, which is implemented by using services of the (n-1)-layer. When systems are not directly connected, intermediate <b>peer</b> <b>entities</b> (called relays) are used. An address uniquely identifies a service access point. The address naming domains need not be restricted to one layer, so it is possible to use just one naming domain for all layers.For each layer {{there are two types of}} standards: protocol standards defining how <b>peer</b> <b>entities</b> at a given layer communicate, and service standards defining how a given layer communicates with the layer above it.|$|E

30|$|According to IEC 62351 - 4, the {{authenticity}} of MMS is provided by <b>peer</b> <b>entity</b> authentication that occurs at association set up time. The authentication is implemented through association control service element (ACSE) security as follows: enabling sender-ACES-requirements field and responder-ACSE-requirement field of the authentication functional unit (FU) of ACSE, defining the data structure MMS_Authentication-value where the signature value is stored.|$|R
50|$|The {{call control}} (CC) {{protocol}} {{is one of}} the protocols of the Connection Management (CM) sublayer. Every mobile station must support the call control protocol.

In the call control protocol, more than one CC entity are defined. Each CC entity is independent from each other and communicates with the correspondent <b>peer</b> <b>entity</b> using its own MM connection. Different CC entities use different transaction identifiers.|$|R

The mechanism also supports transparent remapping of the lanes to give circuit board designers flexibility in how the lanes are physically wired.|$|R

Security of MIH protocol currently relies on security of underlying transport protocols without a mechanism to authenticate <b>peer</b> MIH <b>entities.</b> This lack of authentication of <b>peer</b> MIH <b>entities</b> does not provide proper authorization for MIH services. Because IEEE 802.21 provides services that affect network resource, network cost, and user experience, MIH level security will be an important factor to network providers that want to deploy these MIH services in their networks. Nevertheless, there are very few security mechanisms for MIH services in the literature.|$|R
30|$|Integrity and authenticity: in this scheme, the AuthenticationValue {{filed in}} the GOOSE/SMV message is enabled with {{signature}} authentication based on the HMAC algorithm to ensure the integrity and authenticity of GOOSE/SMV messages, which prevents the data from being tampered or forged during the transmission. Furthermore, we define the data structure of the Authentication value of MMS and adopt <b>peer</b> <b>entity</b> authentication based on the SM 2 algorithm to verify the integrity and authenticity of MMS messages. The method of hashing the date of MMS messages by the SM 3 algorithm can prevent an unauthorized modification. By this way, attackers cannot arbitrarily tamper or forge messages.|$|R

30|$|Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is a {{somewhat}} new “data-oriented” approach for estimating quantitatively the comparative {{performance of a}} set of <b>peer</b> <b>entities</b> called Decision-Making Units (DMUs), which convert multiple inputs into multiple outputs. DEA is essentially a deterministic multi-objective optimization method (thus, dealing with multiple output variables) with the aim to identify actors (DMUs) with the highest productivity (or efficiency). DEA has gained much popularity in performance and benchmark studies (see e.g., Sahin 2012). In recent years, DEA has been extensively applied to operational efficiency problems in public and private sector agencies. This method is particularly useful for comparative studies under conditions of small samples.|$|E

30|$|The {{primary purpose}} in the {{performance}} evaluations of most organizational systems is to appraise the current operations of individual entities and to benchmark these against <b>peer</b> <b>entities</b> to identify best practices. While individual performance measure, or “gap”, analysis has often provided the fundamental basis for performance evaluation and benchmarking (Zhu [2003]), it remains a difficult task to satisfactorily combine multiple disparate, unit-incompatible, single-criteria measurements into an overall conclusion (Camp [1995]). Since a complex entity’s actual performance generally represents multifaceted phenomena, the use of single measures in gap analysis explicitly ignores all interactions, substitutions, and tradeoffs between the various performance measures. Therefore, it is a rare occurrence when a one-measure-at-a-time gap-analysis can suffice {{for the purposes of}} an effective performance evaluation of organizational systems (Camp [1995]; Zhu [2003]).|$|E

40|$|The {{recent years}} have brought many changes to the way {{consumers}} interact with media assets. Today, consumers store their media digitally and access them using multiple devices; {{the role of the}} mobile phone as a universal control and playback device is still growing. Yet, there is no generic architecture for the various devices at home and on the Internet to interact with each other. In this thesis, we enhance the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) to be the core of an Extended Private Media Network (XPMN). Essentially, we create an end-to-end security layer for XMPP providing confidentiality, data integrity, and <b>peer</b> <b>entity</b> authentication between clients, keeping usability constrains for both the end-user and the developer in mind.

40|$|Introduction The sole Transport Connection (TC) release {{facility}} {{provided by}} the current ISO/IEC Connection-Mode Transport Service [ISO 8072] is an abrupt (and thereby possibly destructive) one. At present, in the OSI Reference Model [ISO 7498], the concept of orderly (or graceful) release is introduced at the session service level. So {{it is up to}} the <b>peer</b> session <b>entities</b> to make sure that there are no more in-transit data on the TC to which is assigned the session connection that is to be gracefully released before requesting the abrupt termination of this TC. Some people even think that there is no objective reason for providing an orderly connection release in any layer except the application layer (cf. Question 6 in [ISO SD 9]). They argue that <b>peer</b> application <b>entities</b> could ensure, by way of an exchange of application protocol control information, that there are no more data in transit on the presentation connection and could then safely perform an abrupt termination o...|$|R

The use of Datalog ensures the scalability of our approach to large marketplaces, while Fuzzy Logic provides a neat connection with logical specifications and allows to model soft constraints and how well they could be satisfied by an agreement. Noteworthy is that our approach takes into account in the peer-to-peer matchmaking also preferences of each counterpart and their utilities. This allows to rule out of the match list those counteroffers that, although seemingly appealing for the buyer, would probably lead to failure due to contrasting preferences of the seller, and paves the way to the actual negotiation stage...|$|E
30|$|DEA is a {{mathematical}} programming-based approach for measuring relative efficiency of <b>peer</b> <b>entities</b> called decision-making units (DMUs) that have multiple and identical inputs and outputs. With linear programming methods, non-parametric piece-wise surface (or frontier) is constructed over the data, efficiency measures are calculated relative to this surface (Coelli et al. 2005). It {{is assumed that}} a DMU uses a set of resources (inputs) which it transforms into a set of outcomes (outputs). Therefore, DEA may be applied to governmental agencies, not-for-profit organisations as well as business firm (Cooper et al. 2011) and macroeconomic analyses (see, for example Chien and Hu 2007 or Tong 1997). In this study, 25 EU member states are included to the analysis as the DMUs, the smallest member states: Cyprus, Luxembourg and Malta were excluded as being not homogenous with bigger member states.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{communication}} protocol {{consists of a}} sequence of messages used by <b>peer</b> <b>entities</b> to communicate. Each entity in a network is equipped {{by at least one}} protocol stack. Due to the need for on the fly reconfiguration of protocol stack in future communication and computation devices, formalizing substitutability and compatibility of protocol entities are important in correctness assessment of dynamic reconfiguration. In this paper, we extend Constraint Automata and propose I/O-Constraint Automata to model behavior of protocols and propose enough formalism for substitutability and compatibility relations between protocols. We introduce input-blocking property of {{communication protocol}}s, and show that in the context of communication protocols simulation relation is not strong enough for notion of substitutability. We show the relation between substitutability and compatibility to reason about the correctness in substitution of a protocol with a new one. ...|$|E
40|$|Part 1 : Full PapersInternational audienceEntity {{authentication}} provides {{confidence in}} the claimed identity of a <b>peer</b> <b>entity,</b> but {{the manner in which}} this goal is achieved results in different types of authentication. An important factor in this regard is the order between authentication and the execution of the associated session. In this paper, we consider the case of post-session authentication, where parties authenticate each other {{at the end of their}} interactive session. This use of authentication is different from session-less authentication (e. g., in RFID) and pre-session authentication (e. g., for access control.) Post-session authentication, although a new term, is not a new concept; it is the basis of at least a few practical schemes. We, for the first time, systematically study it and present the underlying authentication model. Further, we show that an important class of problems is solvable using post-session authentication as the only setup assumption. We hope post-session authentication can be used to devise new strategies for building trust among strangers...|$|R
40|$|A {{layer in}} a {{communication}} system has at least three main interfaces: (1) A Service Access Point (SAP) for pro-viding services to a user of an upper layer, (2) an in-verse SAP for accessing services provided by a lower layer, and (3) a logical interface for communication purposes to a remote <b>peer</b> <b>entity,</b> which we call Connection Endpoint (CEP). The CEP actually specifies the communication pro-tocol. In its entirety, the full specification of the commu-nication layer results in a huge, complex state machine. It would be beneficial to individually specify the different interfaces of the communication layer and smoothly cou-ple the specifications. Current modeling languages like the Unified Modeling Language (UML) do not offer a satisfying solution. In this paper, an extension is presented, which pro-vides an approach to couple finite state machines. It enables a modeler not only to specify different aspects of a commu-nication layer but also to describe their coordination and synchronization. Furthermore, the concept of coupled state machines {{can be used for}} other purposes as well, e. g. for specifying Application Programming Interfaces and model-ing the observer pattern...|$|R
