Such behavior can degrade the excellent instantaneous sensitivity of these detectors and create calibration uncertainties. These effects have been observed in the Ge:Be <b>photoconductors</b> and the stressed and unstressed Ge:Ga <b>photoconductors</b> in the Long Wavelength Spectrometer, one of the instruments on the Infrared Space Observatory. A systematic investigation of the transient response of the Long Wavelength Spectrometer detectors to a step change in illumination {{as a function of}} operating temperature, bias electric field, and illumination step size has been carried out to determine operating conditions that minimize the effects of this behavior.
