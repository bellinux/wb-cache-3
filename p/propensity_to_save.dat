5000|$|The {{marginal}} <b>propensity</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> (MPS) is {{the fraction}} {{of an increase in}} income that is not spent on an increase in consumption. That is, the marginal <b>propensity</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> is the proportion of each additional dollar of household income that is used for saving. It is the slope of the line plotting saving against income. [...] For example, if a household earns one extra dollar, and the marginal <b>propensity</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> is 0.35, then of that dollar, the household will spend 65 cents and save 35 cents. Likewise, it is the fractional decrease in saving that results from a decrease in income.|$|E

The estimated regression coefficients are remarkably similar to point estimates available from other recent research based on quite different contemporary household data. Marginal <b>propensities</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> out of unexpected income shocks are large relative <b>to</b> <b>propensities</b> based on expected income movements, though the former lie much below one and the latter much above zero. Thus, while these data readily reject strict parameterizations of the permanent income hypothesis, we nonetheless conclude that families’s saving decisions look quite “modern. ...|$|R

50|$|An {{important}} {{implication of}} marginal <b>propensity</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> is {{measurement of the}} multiplier.

50|$|The MPC {{is higher}} {{in the case of}} poorer people than in rich. When a person earns a higher income, the cost of their basic human needs amount to a smaller {{fraction}} of this income, and correspondingly their average <b>propensity</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> is higher than that of a person with a lower income. The marginal <b>propensity</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> of the richer classes is greater than that of the poorer classes. If, at any time, it is desired to increase aggregate consumption, then the purchasing power should be transferred from the richer classes (with low propensity to consume) to the poorer classes (with a higher propensity to consume). Likewise, if it is desired to reduce community consumption, the purchasing power must be taken away from the poorer classes by taxing consumption. The marginal propensity to consume {{is higher in}} a poor country and lower in the case of rich country. The reason is same as stated above. In the case of rich country, most common of the basic needs of the people have already been satisfied, and all the additional increments of income are saved, resulting in a higher marginal <b>propensity</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> but in a lower marginal propensity to consume. In a poor country, on the other hand, most of the basic needs of the people remain unsatisfied so that additional increments of income go to increase consumption, resulting in a higher marginal propensity to consume and a lower marginal <b>propensity</b> <b>to</b> <b>save.</b> This is the reason MPC is higher in the underdeveloped countries of Asia and Africa, and lower in developed countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Singapore and Germany.|$|E
50|$|The {{marginal}} {{propensity to}} consume (MPC) is the fraction {{of a change in}} disposable income that is consumed. For example, if disposable income rises by $100, and $65 of that $100 is consumed, the MPC is 65%. Restated, the marginal <b>propensity</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> is 35%.|$|E
30|$|We find that, {{although}} the probability <b>to</b> <b>save</b> {{does not depend}} on the temporary nature of migration, there is {{a significant increase in the}} amount of savings in the case where the migrant is staying temporarily in the country. The amount of savings is 26 percent higher for temporary migrants. Another interesting result comes from our nonlinear decomposition model a la Blinder-Oaxaca. The decomposition shows that the saving behavior differs between migrants and natives because of both socio-economic characteristics (e.g., education level, occupational status, age, etc.) and behavioral differences (i.e., <b>propensities</b> <b>to</b> <b>save),</b> but with a higher weight for socio-economic characteristics when introducing the index of financial (in)capability – from 45 percent to over 95 percent.|$|R

The behavior of the household is described with an alternative approach to household behavior. The economic system consists of one production sector and one education sector.

40|$|Why do {{corporations}} accumulate liquid assets? We show theoretically that intertemporal trade-offs between {{interest income}} taxation {{and the cost}} of external finance determine optimal savings. Intriguingly, we find that, controlling for Tobin's "q", saving and cash flow are negatively related because firms lower cash reserves to invest after receiving positive cash-flow shocks, and vice versa. Consistent with theory, we estimate negative <b>propensities</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> out of cash flow. We also find that income uncertainty affects saving more than do external finance constraints. Therefore, contrary to previous evidence, saving propensities reflect too many forces to be used to measure external finance constraints. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association. ...|$|R

40|$|Defined {{contribution}} pensions in many postsecondary {{institutions are}} {{funded by a}} combination of an employer premium and a mandatory employee premium.

Holding constant total compensation, standard reasoning suggests that supplemental savings should depend negatively on the sum of the employer and employee pension contributions. Contrarily, we find that the supplementary savings of professors are significantly more sensitive to employee contributions than to employer contributions. This asymmetry is consistent with different marginal <b>propensities</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> out of the salary and pension components of compensation. Nevertheless, impacts on lifetime utility are relatively modest. © 2011 The President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to extend the {{well-known}} Uzawa twosector model for a national economy to a global economy with any number of countries and any number of regions within each country. It studies international and interregional economic development with interactions among wealth accumulation, amenity change and economic structure under assumptions of profit maximization, utility maximization, and perfect competition. The model shows endogenous interregional and international trade patterns on the basis of microeconomic foundation. We deal with the complicated issues by applying Zhang’s alternative approach to households’ behavior. We simulate the motion of the multi-country and multi-region global economy, identify the existence of an equilibrium point, and confirm the stability of the equilibrium point. We carry out comparative dynamic analysis with regard to the total factor productivity of region’s industrial sectors, total factor productivity of region’s service sectors, <b>propensities</b> <b>to</b> <b>save,</b> regional amenity parameters, <b>propensities</b> <b>to</b> consume housing, and the national population effect on amenity. global economy; spatial agglomeration; regional; national and global growth; amenit...|$|R
