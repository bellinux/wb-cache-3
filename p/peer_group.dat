40|$|Introduction: The Environmental {{social factors}} such as <b>peer</b> <b>groups</b> and sports {{increase}} individual enjoyment andhelp them toevolve. <b>Peer</b> <b>groups,</b> physical activities, and sports might be effective factors on accelerating teenagers and youth socialization andpsycho-social evolution. University and school {{play an important role}} in joining the students into <b>peer</b> <b>groups</b> and sport teamsand as a dynamic factor in social development and evolution. The purpose of this study was to investigate the students’ points of view of the effect of <b>peer</b> <b>groups</b> and sports on education and training process. Methods: This analyticalcross-sectional study wasperformed on 406 Yazd University students in 2010 - 2011 academic year. The students were selected using stratified random sampling and completed a researcher-made questionnaire with a Cronbach Alpha of 82. 7 %. Descriptive statistics such as mean, medium and standard deviation were calculated and Chi Square, Pearson correlation coefficient, t-test, and one-Way ANOVA were used to test the hypotheses. Resalts: The results, statistically significant, indicated that 88 % of the students considered <b>peer</b> <b>groups</b> and 78. 2 % considered sports as highly effective factorson education and training process (p≤ 0. 01). Among the demographic variables, only the marital status had a significant relationship with <b>peer</b> <b>groups</b> and sports. Also mother’s occupation had a significant relationship with <b>peer</b> <b>groups.</b> There was no significant relationship between other variables and the mentioned social variables. Conclusion: The students’ points of view showed that <b>peer</b> <b>groups</b> and sports have a very high effect on education and training process thus leading to the improvement of social relationship and increasinglearning in different groups. Therefore, strengthening the <b>peer</b> <b>groups</b> and sport teams in educational environments has a very important influence on socialization of teenagers and youth thereby facilitating the acquisition of life skills and learning process and thus the education and training development in societ...|$|R

25|$|Families tend to {{seek out}} schools whose {{principal}} languages they share, and ideally one which mirrors their own educational system. Many countries have American schools, French schools, British schools, German Schools and 'International Schools' which often follow {{one of the three}} International Baccalaureate programs. These will be populated by expatriates' children and some children of the local upper middle class. They do this in an effort to maintain linguistic stability and to ensure that their children do not fall behind due to linguistic problems. Where their own language is not available, families will often choose English-speaking schools for their children. They do this because of the linguistic and cultural opportunities being immersed in English might provide their children when they are adults, and because their children {{are more likely to have}} prior exposure to English than to other international languages. This poses the potential for non-English speaking TCKs to have a significantly different experience from TCKs for whom English is a native language.
