25|$|There {{are four}} {{posterior}} thigh muscles. The biceps femoris has two heads: The long head has its origin on the ischial tuberosity {{together with the}} semitendinosus and acts on two joints. The short head originates from the middle third of the linea aspera on the shaft of the femur and the lateral intermuscular septum of thigh, and acts on only one joint. These two heads unite to form the biceps which inserts {{on the head of}} the fibula. The biceps flexes the knee joint and rotates the flexed leg laterally— it is the only lateral rotator of the knee and thus has to oppose all medial rotator. Additionally, the long head extends the hip joint. The semitendinosus and the semimembranosus share their origin with the long head of the biceps, and both attaches on the medial side of the proximal head of the tibia together with the gracilis and sartorius to form the <b>pes</b> <b>anserinus.</b> The semitendinosus acts on two joints; extension of the hip, flexion of the knee, and medial rotation of the leg. Distally, the semimembranosus' tendon is divided into three parts referred to as the <b>pes</b> <b>anserinus</b> profondus. Functionally, the semimembranosus is similar to the semitendinosus, and thus produces extension at the hip joint and flexion and medial rotation at the knee.|$|E
25|$|The {{adductor}} {{muscles of}} the thigh are innervated by the obturator nerve, {{with the exception of}} pectineus which receives fibers from the femoral nerve, and the adductor magnus which receives fibers from the tibial nerve. The gracilis arises from near the pubic symphysis and is unique among the adductors in that it reaches past the knee to attach on the medial side of the shaft of the tibia, thus acting on two joints. It share its distal insertion with the sartorius and semitendinosus, all three muscles forming the <b>pes</b> <b>anserinus.</b> It is the most medial muscle of the adductors, and with the thigh abducted its origin can be clearly seen arching under the skin. With the knee extended, it adducts the thigh and flexes the hip. The pectineus has its origin on the iliopubic eminence laterally to the gracilis and, rectangular in shape, extends obliquely to attach immediately behind the lesser trochanter and down the pectineal line and the proximal part of the linea aspera on the femur. It is a flexor of the hip joint, and an adductor and a weak medial rotator of the thigh. The adductor brevis originates on the inferior ramus of the pubis below the gracilis and stretches obliquely below the pectineus down to the upper third of the linea aspera. Except for being an adductor, it is a lateral rotator and weak flexor of the hip joint. The adductor longus has its origin at superior ramus of the pubis and inserts medially on the middle third of the linea aspera. Primarily an adductor, it is also responsible for some flexion. The adductor magnus has its origin just behind the longus and lies deep to it. Its wide belly divides into two parts: One is inserted into the linea aspera and the tendon of the other reaches down to adductor tubercle on the medial side of the femur's distal end where it forms an intermuscular septum that separates the flexors from the extensors. Magnus is a powerful adductor, especially active when crossing legs. Its superior part is a lateral rotator but the inferior part acts as a medial rotator on the flexed leg when rotated outward and also extends the hip joint. The adductor minimus is an incompletely separated subdivision of the adductor magnus. Its origin forms an anterior part of the magnus and distally it is inserted on the linea aspera above the magnus. It acts to adduct and lateral rotate the femur.|$|E
2500|$|Of the {{anterior}} thigh muscles the largest are the four {{muscles of the}} quadriceps femoris: the central rectus femoris, which is surrounded by the three vasti, the vastus intermedius, medialis, and lateralis. Rectus femoris {{is attached to the}} pelvis with two tendons, while the vasti are inserted to the femur. All four muscles unite in a common tendon inserted into the patella from where the patellar ligament extends it down to the tibial tuberosity. Fibers from the medial and lateral vasti form two retinacula that stretch past the patella on either sides down to the condyles of the tibia. The quadriceps is the knee extensor, but the rectus femoris additionally flexes the hip joint, and articular muscle of the knee protects the articular capsule of the knee joint from being nipped during extension. The sartorius [...] runs superficially and obliquely down on {{the anterior}} side of the thigh, from the anterior superior iliac spine to the <b>pes</b> <b>anserinus</b> on the medial side of the knee, from where it is further extended into the crural fascia. The sartorius acts as a flexor on both the hip and knee, but, due to its oblique course, also contributes to medial rotation of the leg as one of the <b>pes</b> <b>anserinus</b> muscles (with the knee flexed), and to lateral rotation of the hip joint.|$|E

50|$|Crossing {{on top of}} {{the lower}} part of the MCL is the <b>pes</b> <b>anserinus,</b> the joined tendons of the sartorius, gracilis, and semitendinosus muscles; a bursa is {{interposed}} between the two.|$|E
50|$|The anserine bursa (tibial intertendinous bursa) is a sub muscular bursa {{located just}} below the <b>pes</b> <b>anserinus</b> on the anteromedial {{proximal}} tibia. Pes anserine bursitis is a common inflammatory condition of the anserine bursa.|$|E
50|$|The muscle's fibers run {{vertically}} downward, {{ending in}} a rounded tendon. This tendon passes behind the medial condyle of the femur, curves around the medial condyle of the tibia where it becomes flattened, and inserts into {{the upper part of}} the medial surface of the body of the tibia, below the condyle. For this reason, the muscle is a lower limb adductor. At its insertion the tendon is situated immediately above that of the semitendinosus muscle, and its upper edge is overlapped by the tendon of the sartorius muscle, which it joins to form the <b>pes</b> <b>anserinus.</b> The <b>pes</b> <b>anserinus</b> is separated from the medial collateral ligament of the knee-joint by a bursa.|$|E
50|$|It passes {{behind the}} medial condyle of the femur {{to end in}} a tendon. This tendon curves {{anteriorly}} to join the tendons of the gracilis and semitendinosus muscles in the <b>pes</b> <b>anserinus,</b> where it inserts into the superomedial surface of the tibia.|$|E
50|$|This technique, {{described}} in detail by LaPrade et al., uses two grafts in four separate tunnels. An incision is made over the medial knee 4 cm medial to the patella, and extended distally 7 to 8 cm past the joint line, directly over the <b>pes</b> <b>anserinus</b> tendons.|$|E
50|$|At its {{insertion}} {{it gives}} off from its lower border a prolongation {{to the deep}} fascia of the leg and lies behind the tendon of the sartorius, and below that of the gracilis, {{to which it is}} united. These three tendons form {{what is known as the}} <b>pes</b> <b>anserinus,</b> so named because it looks like the foot of a goose.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pes</b> <b>anserinus</b> is the {{insertion}} of the conjoined tendons Sartorius, Gracilis, and Semitendinosus into the anteromedial proximal tibia. Theoretically, bursitis results from stress to this area (e.g. stress may result when an obese individual with anatomic deformity from arthritis ascends or descends stairs). An occurrence of pes anserine bursitis commonly is characterized by pain, especially when climbing stairs, tenderness, and local swelling.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pes</b> <b>anserinus</b> ("goose foot") {{refers to}} the {{conjoined}} tendons of three muscles that insert onto the anteromedial (front and inside) surface of the proximal extremity of the tibia. The muscles are the sartorius, gracilis and semitendinosus {{sometimes referred to as}} the guy ropes. The name [...] "goose foot" [...] arises from the three-pronged manner in which the conjoined tendon inserts onto the tibia.|$|E
5000|$|Bursitis {{commonly}} affects superficial bursae. These {{include the}} subacromial, prepatellar, retrocalcaneal, and <b>pes</b> <b>anserinus</b> bursae of the shoulder, knee, heel and shin, etc. (see below). Symptoms vary from localized warmth and erythema [...] to joint pain and stiffness, to stinging pain {{that surrounds the}} joint around the inflamed bursa. In this condition, the pain usually is worse during and after activity, and then the bursa and the surrounding joint becomes stiff the next morning.|$|E
5000|$|The {{etymology}} of {{the name}} relates to the insertion of the conjoined tendons into the anteromedial proximal tibia. From anterior to posterior, the <b>pes</b> <b>anserinus</b> {{is made up of}} the tendons of the sartorius, gracilis, and semitendinosus muscles. The tendon's name, which literally means [...] "goose's foot," [...] was inspired by the pes anserinus's webbed, footlike structure. The conjoined tendon lies superficial to the tibial insertion of the medial collateral ligament (MCL) of the knee.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the many}} {{conditions}} that can disrupt {{the use of the}} sartorius is pes anserine bursitis, an inflammatory condition of the medial portion of the knee. This condition usually occurs in athletes from overuse and is characterized by pain, swelling and tenderness. The <b>pes</b> <b>anserinus</b> is made up from the tendons of the gracilis, semitendinosus, and sartorius muscles; these tendons attach onto the anteromedial proximal tibia. When inflammation of the bursa underlying the tendons occurs they separate from the head of the tibia.|$|E

The subpopliteal bursa is located deep to the muscle. Popliteus flexes the knee joint and medially rotates the leg.|$|E
5000|$|The medial {{collateral}} ligament (MCL a.k.a. [...] "tibial") {{stretches from}} the medial epicondyle of the femur to the medial tibial condyle.

The MCL is partly covered by the <b>pes</b> <b>anserinus</b> and the tendon of the semimembranosus passes under it. It protects the medial side of the knee from being bent open by a stress applied to the lateral side of the knee (a valgus force). The lateral collateral ligament (LCL a.k.a. [...] "fibular") stretches from the lateral epicondyle of the femur {{to the head of}} fibula. It is separate from both the joint capsule and the lateral meniscus. It protects the lateral side from an inside bending force (a varus force). The anterolateral ligament (ALL) is situated in front of the LCL.|$|E

40|$|Forty-eight men {{and three}} women were {{reviewed}} an average ofthirty-one months after <b>pes</b> <b>anserinus</b> transposition for chronic anteromedial rotational instability ofthe knee. Their {{ages ranged from}} eighteen to forty-two years (average twenty-five years). All but four of the injuries occurred during sport. The interval between injury and operation averaged thirty months. During this time twenty-three patients had had other operations of which eighteen were for excision of menisci. A further sixteen patients required excision of one or both menisci {{at the time of}} <b>pes</b> <b>anserinus</b> transposition. After operation large haematoinata had to be expressed from four wounds. One patient had a pulmonary embolism. All made a complete recovery. Worthwhile improvement of stability during activity was found in forty-two of the fifty-one knees. Pre-existing degeneration of articular cartilage associated with severe instability of long duration was the main cause of failure. Good motivation was important for success. Four grades of disability are described according to the severity of symptoms. It was found that a successful operation gave approximately one grade of improvement on this scale.

40|$|Introduction. Knee {{ligament}} reconstructions {{are commonly}} performed using hamstring tendon grafts. We observed anecdotally {{that there was}} a difference in the fat distribution superficial to the <b>pes</b> <b>anserinus</b> between men and women and proposed that this effect was independent of BMI, being significantly greater in women. Methods. We performed a prospective study to evaluate 40 MRI scans performed in 20 women and 20 men. The scans allowed visualisation of the insertion of the hamstring tendons at the <b>pes</b> <b>anserinus.</b> Results. The mean BMI of the male patients was 25. 6 (19. 8 – 37. 2) and of the female patients was 24. 7 (17. 9 – 34. 5). The mean fat distribution superficial to the <b>pes</b> <b>anserinus</b> in men was 16. 2 [*]mm (4. 1 – 29. 4) and in women was 29. 7 [*]mm (19. 6 – 47. 5). There was a significant increase in fat superficial to the hamstring tendons in women compared with men (P< 0. 001), despite no significant difference in BMI (P= 0. 5). Conclusions. Our evaluation of a prospective series of MRI scans has shown that there is significantly more fat superficial to the insertion of the hamstring tendons in women than in men. This effect is independent of BMI and may influence exposure during hamstring tendon graft harvesting...|$|E
40|$|Background: Patellar dislocations {{are either}} due to superolateral {{contracture}} {{of the soft}} tissue or imbalance of the power between the vastus medialis (VM) and the vastus lateralis (VL). The imbalance of muscle power as an etiology of patellar dislocation has not been studied. Hence, we studied the recurrent, habitual and permanent dislocations of the patella with an electromyogram (EMG) of the vastus medialis, vastus lateralis, and <b>pes</b> <b>anserinus,</b> before and after realignment operations, to document the muscle imbalance and effectiveness of the realignment operation. Materials and Methods: An electromyographic investigation was carried out on the vastus medialis and vastus lateralis in nine recurrent, 20 habitual, and 13 permanent dislocations of the patella, before and after their realignment operations. <b>Pes</b> <b>anserinus</b> transposition, which acted as a medial stabilizer of the patella, was also investigated with an EMG study, to understand its role on patellar stability at 0 &# 896;, 30 &# 896;, 60 &# 896;, 90 &# 896;, 120 &# 896;, 150 &# 896;, and full flexion of the knee. The age of the patients varied from nine to 30 (mean 15) years. There were 24 males and 18 females. Twenty-six patellar dislocations were {{on the right and}} 16 were on the left side. Results: Electromyographic pictures reveal subnormal activity of the vastus medialis in all types of dislocations and similar activities of the vastus lateralis in permanent and habitual dislocations recorded pre operatively, which recovered to almost normal values postoperatively, at the mean one-year follow-up. <b>Pes</b> <b>anserinus,</b> which was used for medial stabilization of the patella after its realignment, maintained normal EMG activity before and after the operation. Conclusion: This study is significant for understanding the imbalance of muscle activities in patients with an unstable patella, which can be rectified without recurrence after <b>pes</b> <b>anserinus</b> transposition...|$|E
40|$|When the {{superficial}} fibers of the medial collateral ligament {{of the knee}} are torn without tearing of the deep fibers, the anterior superficial fibers may displace over the <b>pes</b> <b>anserinus</b> tendons, so that healing back to the tibial insertion site may be jeopardized.

40|$|Abstract Purpose To {{investigate}} {{the usefulness of}} the “inducer grafting” technique for regeneration of the semitendinosus (ST) tendon after its harvest for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Methods Twenty knees of 20 patients (mean age at the time of surgery, 23. 1 [*]years) underwent ACL reconstruction with a double bundle autograft using the ST tendon (7 patients) and the ST + the gracilis (G) tendons (13 patients). “Inducer grafting” technique After harvesting the ST tendon, a passing pin with a loop thread is inserted along with the tendon stripper. The passing pin is pulled out from the medial thigh and the loop thread retained. As an inducer graft, the ST tendon branch is used. After the ACL graft has been secured, the inducer graft is sutured to the <b>pes</b> <b>anserinus</b> and the proximal end passed through by pulling the thread out. Then the inducer graft is placed within the tendon canal. The mean follow-up period was 15 [*]months. The presence and morphology of the regenerated ST tendon were examined by MRI. And the isometric hamstring strength was examined at 45 °, 90 ° and 120 ° of knee flexion. Results One month after the operation in all the patients, MRI demonstrated a low-intensity structure at the anatomical location of the ST, {{at the level of the}} superior pole of the patella and the joint line, apparently representing the regenerated ST tendon. Four months after the operation, the distal portion of the regenerated ST tendon had reached the <b>pes</b> <b>anserinus</b> in all patients. Twelve months after the operation, the regenerated ST tendon was hypertrophic in 19 of the 20 patients (95 %). The isometric knee flexion torque of the ACL-reconstructed limb was significantly lower at 90 ° and 120 ° compared with the contralateral limb. Conclusion These results suggest that the “inducer grafting” technique is able to improve the regeneration rate of the harvested ST tendon and promote hypertrophy of the regenerated ST tendon, extending all the way to the <b>pes</b> <b>anserinus.</b> However, this technique couldn’t improve the deficits in knee flexion torque after ACL reconstruction. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{transversal}} support tibial plateau (TSTP) {{concept was}} developed to retain both cruciate ligaments during total knee arthroplasty. TSTP design consists of two individual joint surfaces, reinforced beneath the joint line by two joint surface supports and buttressed by a single transversal support (TS). This configuration is devised to provide good bony anchoring especially for the TS, and to ensure long-term alignment of the individual joint surfaces. TS insertion requires a small extra incision. This study assessed techniques to implant the TS into the tibia. Using a specially designed aiming device, TS insertion from each side was evaluated in 13 human cadaveric knees (10 formalin-fixed, two Thiel embalmed, one fresh) at defined intervals of 15, 25, and 35 mm beneath the joint line. Particular {{attention was paid to}} potentially endangered structures, e. g., the medial collateral ligament (MCL), <b>pes</b> <b>anserinus,</b> and common peroneal nerve, as well as impediments to insertion, e. g., the fibula. TS implantation was successfully performed using both medial and lateral approaches. From medial, the TS was inserted safely at the 15 mm interval with the knee in maximum flexion and external rotation. With increasing intervals, however, the MCL and <b>pes</b> <b>anserinus</b> became progressively more susceptible to injury. In contrast, with the lateral approach, the operative field was quite close to the fibular head for the 25 mm interval. However, with the knee in extension, no other important structures were at risk...|$|E
30|$|They are {{extremely}} rare and {{are thought to}} be produced by mucoid degeneration and cyst formation of the periosteum [1, 2, 6 – 9]. They are most commonly located in the proximal tibial shaft, in proximity to <b>pes</b> <b>anserinus.</b> On MR images they typically appear as periosteally based, well-defined homogeneous lesions with fluid signal intensity. Superficial cortical erosion and scalloping, as well as reactive new bone formation may be present. Other lesions of periosteal origin, such as periosteal chondroma, subperiosteal hematoma, chronic subperiosteal abscess or malignant soft tissue tumours, mainly when they erode the adjacent bone and cause periosteal reaction, may need differential diagnosis from a periosteal ganglion.|$|E
