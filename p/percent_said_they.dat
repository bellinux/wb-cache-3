Several {{studies have suggested that}} survey responses are unreliable. A 2003 study in Ghana found that in 1995 four <b>percent</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> had not undergone FGM, but in 2000 said they had, while 11 percent switched in the other direction. In Tanzania in 2005, 66 percent reported FGM, but a medical exam found that 73 percent had undergone it. In Sudan in 2006, a significant percentage of infibulated women and girls reported a less severe type.|$|E

Mead amounted to 0.5 percent of total alcohol consumption in Poland in 2013. Only nine percent of adult Poles polled that year declared that they had drunk mead {{at least once in}} the last three months; 27 <b>percent</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> had enjoyed mead in the last 12 months.

Eighty-eight percent of fire service women responding had experienced some form of sexual harassment {{at some point in their}} fire service careers or volunteer time. Nearly seventy percent of the women in the survey said they were experiencing ongoing harassment at the time of the study. Of the 339 women who said they had complained about harassment, only a third (115 women) listed only positive outcomes: investigating/taking care of the problem, and disciplining the harasser.

25|$|During {{the first}} few months of 2014, The Jewish Agency of Israel has {{continued}} to encourage an increase of French aliyah through aliyah fairs, Hebrew-language courses, sessions which help potential immigrants to find jobs in Israel, and immigrant absorption in Israel. A May 2014 survey revealed that 74 percent of French Jews consider leaving France for Israel where of the 74 percent, 29.9 percent cited anti-Semitism. Another 24.4 cited their desire to “preserve their Judaism,” while 12.4 <b>percent</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> were attracted by other countries. “Economic considerations” was cited by 7.5 percent of the respondents. By June 2014, it was estimated by the end of 2014 a full 1 percent of the French Jewish community will have made aliyah to Israel, the largest in a single year. Many Jewish leaders stated the emigration is being driven by a combination of factors, including the cultural gravitation towards Israel and France’s economic woes, especially for the younger generation drawn by the possibility of other socioeconomic opportunities in the more vibrant Israeli economy. During the Hebrew year 5774 (September 2013 - September 2014) for the first time ever, more Jews made Aliyah from France than any other country, with approximately 6,000 French Jews making aliyah, mainly fleeing rampant antisemitism, pro-Palestinian and anti-Zionist violence and economic malaise with France becoming the top sending country for aliyah as of late September 2014.|$|E

Today, increased computer usage and the use of SMS text-messaging, especially among young people, means that a large portion of those people's everyday use of Chinese characters is done using input methods, not by hand. In a 2010 survey by Dayang Net, 43 <b>percent</b> of respondents <b>said</b> <b>they</b> use the computer all the time for their jobs and 43 <b>percent</b> <b>said</b> that <b>they</b> only write out characters by hand when filling out forms or writing their signature.|$|R

Thousands took to the streets, demanding justice for Sulistyaningsih. Although the government calls her case an isolated one, welfare groups say that many workers are victims of [...] "modern-day slavery" [...] and abuse by employers. Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor reported that a substantial percentage of workers are mistreated by their employers; of 2,500 workers interviewed, at least 25 <b>percent</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> had experienced violations of their contract (including pay less than the MAW and being denied their mandatory weekly day of rest and statutory holidays).

Smartphone owners between the ages of 18 and 44 were more than twice as likely as owners ages 45 or older to respond to embedded ads on both phablets and standard smartphones as well as on tablets and personal computers. This survey was conducted for RJI in June 2015 by Ipsos, one of the world's largest independent market research companies. It included 1, 001 adults from all 50 states who owned smartphones. Forty-one percent indicated that they had a large-screen smartphone (phablet). Tablets were used by 53 percent of phablet owners and 39 percent of standard smartphone owners.

According to Planning Commission of India, teenagers are about one fourth {{of the total population}} and have major implication for the future, since reproductive and sexual behavior during adolescence have far reaching effects. This is especially relevant in India where reproductive health has been considered synonymous with women’s health and hence reproductive health of men has received little attention.
