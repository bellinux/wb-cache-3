In which Macht {{used his}} <b>phytopharmacology</b> {{technique}} on samples of both Levitically clean and unclean animals, and showed a markedly higher phytotoxic index for the unclean meats and the correlation was 100%.|$|E
5000|$|Macht applied his {{technique}} of <b>phytopharmacology</b> {{to a variety}} of substances, including the blood of people suffering from medical conditions. In 1930, he reported it could be used to demonstrate the presence of snake venom and menotoxin (a toxin thought to be present in the blood of menstruating women). He felt the technique could aid in the differential diagnosis of pernicious anemia, leprosy, pemphigus and other conditions. At {{the time of his death}} it was reported that {{his technique}} could serve as an indicator of mental illness, since [...] "the blood of persons suffering from certain types of mental illness acts as a poison on species of the European bean". To date, neither the existence of menotoxin nor the ability of <b>phytopharmacology</b> to predict toxicity to humans has been scientifically corroborated by independent researchers.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Phytopharmacology</b> {{is a term}} {{coined by}} the Russian {{scientist}} David Macht in the 1930s. Macht used the term for the field of study {{of the effects of}} drugs on plants. The term has since changed its meaning to become an established field of drug research, where the active substances come from plants (a field Macht would have called zoopharmacology where the drugs are applied to humans or animals). One journal in the field is Phytomedicine: International Journal of Phytotherapy & <b>Phytopharmacology.</b> The advantages of seeking medicines from plants are due both to the millions of years of co-evolution between plants and animals which has led to interactions between their constituent chemicals, and the nature of enzyme driven synthesis leading to optically pure chiral molecules whose reactions in the mammalian body can be very specific.|$|E
50|$|The use of <b>phytopharmacology</b> as a {{predictor}} of toxicity to humans was mainly restricted to the work of Macht and Macht's work was published in the journal Science. Currently, toxicity testing is mostly performed on animal subjects (both live animals and animal tissues), and the detection of individual toxins is performed with mass spectrometry.|$|E

50|$|Macht {{was known}} for his {{pioneering}} use of a technique he termed <b>phytopharmacology</b> which involved measuring the effects of drugs on plants. Macht's specific technique was to measure the growth rate of Lupinus albus seedlings when dosed with a test substance, and compare this against a control group of undosed seeds. The relative length of root growth would determine what he called the phytotoxic index, and provide a measure of the toxicity of the substance to the plants.|$|E
50|$|His {{claims to}} have used <b>phytopharmacology</b> to {{demonstrate}} the presence of menotoxin in the saliva, tears and blood of menstruating women are contentious at best. At the time, {{the theory of the}} existence of menotoxin was widely believed. Macht saw his studies as confirmation of this and of the biblical teachings regarding the uncleanliness of menstruating women. There have been few recent studies performed to prove or disprove the existence of menotoxin because a general lack of interest in the issue.|$|E

With the aim of reveal-ing the molecular mechanisms underlying Circulat’s biological activity, the effects of Circulat treatment on gene expression levels were examined in the cultured human fibroblast cell line MRC- 5 using Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays. The analysis identified 187 genes, the expression levels of which underwent significant changes upon Circulat treatment. These include four genes (IL 6, HMGA 1, SLC 19 A 2 and C 4 A) that have been implicated previously in the development of diabetes. A large proportion of the identified genes are involved in energy metabolism, protein synthesis, glucose metabolism and signaling pathways.

40|$|Walnuts grow {{on large}} trees, {{known for their}} beauty, timber and tasty edible nuts. There are many {{varieties}} of walnuts that vary in hardiness, nut size and thickness of the nut shell. When {{it comes to their}} health benefits, Walnuts definitely are not hard nuts to crack. They contain free radical scavenging compounds like ellagic acid, juglone and certain phytosterols that support the immune system and appear to have anti-cancer properties. Walnuts have higher contents of polyunsaturated fatty acids including α-Linolenic acid, than do other nuts which may give walnuts additional anti-atherogenic and cosmetic value. It was found in clinical trials that walnut consumption in the amount of two to three servings per day consistently decreased total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. Linolenic acid and Linoleic acids present abundantly in walnuts are crucial for maintaining skin functions such as regulation of transepidermal water loss and anti- inflammatory action. The beneficial action of walnut oil on skin is known for centuries and is widely used in cosmetic industry. The walnut oil is a component of dry skin creams, anti-wrinkle and anti-ageing products as it possesses moisturizing property as well as free radical scavenging capacity. Besides, they also exhibit anti-microbial, anti-diabetic, anti-stress, anti-ageing and Hepatoprotective activities. “Walnuts are better than cookies, french fries or potato chips, when you need a snack” as they provide rich nutrients.

40|$|AbstractEthnopharmacological relevanceThe lack of ethnoveterinary {{surveys in}} Brazil, {{especially}} in the Amazon region, results in losses in the veterinary <b>phytopharmacology</b> field and in scientific documentation of the cultural traditions of plant use {{in the treatment of}} animal diseases. Aim of the studyTo catalog, analyze and disseminate the ethnoveterinary knowledge of the inhabitants of Colares Island, Pará state, eastern Amazon, Brazil. Materials and methodsA total of 72 interviews were conducted, and semi-structured questionnaires were answered by 18 men and 54 women. The data obtained were quantitatively analyzed using the informant consensus factor (ICF) and use value (UV). The plants with a reported medicinal use for domestic animals were harvested, herbalized and botanically identified. ResultsFifty-six plants, distributed in 49 genera and 35 families, were indicated to have 23 different medicinal uses, divided into six categories of use. The highest ICF (0. 80) was obtained for the antiparasitic class. The Euphorbiaceae family exhibited the highest number of citations, and the species with the highest UVs were Caladium cf. bicolor, Bixa orellana, Carapa guianensis, Jatropha curcas and Cymbopogon citratus. The parts of the 56 plants that were most frequently used to prepare ethnoveterinary medications were the leaves (46 %), bark (15 %), roots and fruit (10 %). The use of the macerated leaves was the most common method of application, used by 43 % of the interviewees, and the majority of the preparations (87. 3 %) used a single plant. In addition to medicinal plants, the interviewees reported the use of products of animal and mineral origin. ConclusionThe present study contributed to the establishment of an inventory of plants used in ethnoveterinary practices in this region of the Brazilian eastern Amazon. Future phytochemical and pharmacological studies are needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of the identified plants, enabling communities to use them in a more economic, effective and safe manner...|$|E
40|$|Abstract During {{the years}} 2003 – 2005, a {{comparative}} ethnobotanical field {{survey was conducted}} on remedies used in traditional animal healthcare in eight Mediterranean areas.

One hundred and thirty-six veterinary preparations and 110 plant taxa were recorded in the survey, with Asteraceae and Lamiaceae being the most quoted botanical families. For certain plant species the survey uncovered veterinary phytotherapeutical indications that were very uncommon, and to our knowledge never recorded before. These include Anabasis articulata (Chenopodiaceae), Cardopatium corymbosum (Asteraceae), Lilium martagon (Liliaceae), Dorycnium rectum (Fabaceae), Oenanthe pimpinelloides (Apiaceae), Origanum floribundum (Lamiaceae), Tuberaria lignosa (Cistaceae), and Dittrichia graveolens (Asteraceae). These phytotherapeutical indications are briefly discussed in this report, taking into account modern <b>phytopharmacology</b> and phytochemistry. The percentage of overall botanical veterinary taxa recorded in all the study areas was extremely low (8 %), however when all taxa belonging to the same botanical genus are considered, this portion increases to 17 %. Nevertheless, very few plant uses were found {{to be part of a}} presumed "Mediterranean" cultural heritage in veterinary practices, which raises critical questions about the concept of Mediterraneanism in ethnobotany and suggests that further discussion is required. Nearly the half of the recorded veterinary plant uses for mammals uncovered in this survey have also been recorded in the same areas in human folk medicine, suggesting a strong link between human and veterinary medical practices, and perhaps also suggesting the adaptive origins of a few medical practices. Since most of the recorded data concern remedies for treating cattle, sheep, goats, and camels, it would be interesting to test a few of the recorded phytotherapeuticals in the future, to see if they are indeed able to improve animal healthcare in breeding environments, or to raise the quality of dairy and meat products in the absence of classical, industrial, veterinary pharmaceuticals. </p...|$|E
