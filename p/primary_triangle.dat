This work {{became the basis for}} the CIE u,v color difference diagram in 1960, slightly modified into the 1976 CIELUV color difference space. In 1939 he was instrumental in developing the NBS color difference formula. When in 1947 at the suggestion of the U.S. National Research Council the Optical Society of America (OSA) undertook to develop a perceptually uniform color space Judd became its chairman and remained in that position until 1968, when D. L. MacAdam assumed the chairmanship, with results published in 1974. One of the key findings was “that strictly uniform color scales of all kinds are not homologous with Euclidean space” to which Judd proposed a solution implemented in the OSA Uniform Color Space.|$|E
40|$|The {{study is}} focused on the “father-mother-infant” <b>primary</b> <b>triangle,</b> which starts {{developing}} during pregnancy with the co-parental interaction, and has a specific role on the early infant’s interactive development. Several studies have demonstrated links between the co-parental interactions in pregnancy {{and the quality of the}} early adult-child interactions (McHale, 2007). The research aimed to investigate: a) the characteristics of co-parenting in pregnancy with the prenatal Lausanne Trilogue Play (LTP, Corboz-Warnery and Fivaz-Depeursinge, 2001); b) the patterns of stability and change of early triadic interactions from 4 ° to 9 ° month of the infant with the postnatal Lausanne Trilogue Play (LTP; Fivaz-Depeursinge and Corboz-Warnery, 1999); c) the role and/or the influence of co-parental interaction on the development of mother-father-child interactions in the first year of child. 70 non-referred primiparous families were recruited at child-birth courses. Observational data were collected at time 1 (7 th month of pregnancy) by the prenatal LTP, and at postnatal times 2 and 3 (when infants were four and nine months of age) by the postnatal LTP. Collected data show good reliability of the LTP coding and a consistent factorial structure. The analyses highlight an improvement of the family interactions over the first year: the quality of triadic family interactions increases from pregnancy to parenthood. The adult interactive capacities in pregnancy represent an interactive matrix for the construction of family relations during the child’ first year and may be considered as a central factor in the infant’s development of early triadic interactive abilities...|$|E

The aims of the study were to investigate a) the characteristics of the triadic interactions during pregnancy; b) the patterns of stability and change in the triadic family interactions from pregnancy to 9 months. Method: 100 non-refered primiparous families were recruited at child-birth courses. In addition to validated questionnaires, observational data were collected at time 1 (7 th months of pregnancy) in the prenatal LTP, and at postnatal times 2 and 3 (4 and 9 months). Results: Aim 1 : The Structure of the Play and the Intuitive Behaviours Scales seem the most representative dimensions in the prenatal period, which are also predictive of family interactions at 9 th month post-natal (R 2 =. 07; F(1, 69) = 5. 06, p=. 028 (t= 2. 25; p=. 028; β=. 26). Aim 2 : the multilevel analyses highlight an improvement of the family alliance over the first year. Findings show a linear relation between the time and the quality of family interactions (t= 4. 78; p<. 001; B= 2. 36), that improves by 2. 35 point in each observational phase. Conclusion: Coparental capacities in pregnancy represent an interactive matrix for the construction of the early family relations in the first year and may be considered as protective factors in the child development of early triadic interactive abilities...|$|E

40|$|Background: This study {{takes its}} {{theoretical}} {{start from the}} Lausanne Triadic Paradigm which describes the fathermother- infant <b>primary</b> <b>triangle</b> – which starts developing during pregnancy – {{as one of the}} primary matrices of affective-relational development in early infancy. From a methodological point of view, this concept relies on the Lausanne Trilogue Play (LTP) observational paradigm. Objectives: The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate a) the psychometric characteristics of the administration and coding of the pre-natal and post-natal LTP procedure; b) the patterns of stability and/or change in triadic family interactions from pregnancy till the baby’s 9 th month. Method: 70 non-referred primiparous families were recruited at child-birth courses of two North-Italian hospitals. Observational data were collected at time 1 (7 th month of pregnancy) with the prenatal LTP, and at postnatal times 2 and 3 (when the baby was 4 and 9 months old). Results: The collected data show good reliability of the LTP coding system and a consistent factorial structure in line with previous validation studies (Carneiro et al., 2006; Favez et al., 2006). The applied multilevel analysis highlights an improvement in triadic interactive competences during the first year. Findings show a linear relationship between time and quality of family interactions whereby competences improve by 2. 35 points at each observational phase. Family interactions are not stable: rather, the quality of triadic family interactions increases from pregnancy to parenthood.

40|$|Infantile Anorexia (IA), {{defined by}} the Diagnostic Classification of Mental Health and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood Revised (DC: 0 - 3 R, Zero To Three, 2005), occurs when the child (a) refuses to eat {{adequate}} amounts of food for at least 1 month, and shows growth deficiency, (b) does not communicate hunger and lacks interest in food, and (c) the child’s food refusal does not follow a traumatic event and is not due to an underlying medical illness. IA usually emerges during the transition to self-feeding, when the child issues of autonomy are played out daily in the feeding situation. Studies evidence that the feeding interactions between children with IA and their mothers are characterized by low reciprocity, greater interactional conflict and negative affects (Chatoor et al., 2000; Ammaniti et al., 2010, 2012). Moreover, these studies pointed out that maternal depression and eating disorders are frequently associated with IA (Cooper et al., 2004; Ammaniti et al., 2010; Lucarelli et al., 2013). To date, research has focused almost exclusively on the mother–child dyad, while fathers’ involvement, co-parental and family interactions are poorly studied. The current study is a pilot research that investigated mother–father–child triadic interactions, during feeding and play, in families with children diagnosed with IA, in comparison to families with normally developing children. Until now, at the study participated N D 10 families (five with a child with IA diagnosis and five with lack of child’s IA diagnosis, matched for child’s age and gender). The parents–child triadic interactions were assessed in feeding and play contexts using the Lausanne Trilogue Play (Fivaz-Depeursinge and Corboz-Warnery, 1999), adapted to observe father-mother-infant <b>primary</b> <b>triangle</b> in the feeding context, compared to the play context (Lucarelli et al., 2012). Families of the IA-group showed difficulties in expressing and sharing pleasure and positive affects, and in structuring a predictable and flexible context. Children showed little autonomy and difficulty in being actively engaged and tune with parents. Dysfunctional family interactions are a critical issue for IA that affects co-parental and family subsystems, stressing the importance of an articulated diagnostic assessment in order to target effective treatment approaches...|$|E

40|$|Background: {{this paper}} {{presents}} a longitudinal study {{of the development of}} family interactions from pregnancy to the first 18 months of the infant's life. Theoretical and methodological work is based on Lausanne developmental systems approach, which focuses on the father-mother-infant <b>primary</b> <b>triangle</b> as the interactive matrix to the development of emotional relationships. The study has two main aims: a) to investigate the psychometric characteristic of the prenatal and postnatal Lausanne Trilogue Play procedure in the Italian context and the comparison with the Lausanne validation studies; b) to study the development of traidic families ' interactions in the family and the patterns of stability and/or change during the first 18 months of infants' life. Methods: 70 non-referred primiparous families were recruited at child birth courses. We used the Lausanne Trilogue Play (LTP) an observational procedure to evaluate the development of the interactive competences of families. Families played an interaction with a doll at the 7 th month of the pregnancy, and then played with the infant at 4, 9 and 18 months. Results: aim 1 : the data show a good inter-rater reliability of LTP coding system (a =. 73) and a consistent factorial structure (KMO =. 79; Bartlett test (N = 70, 10) = 104. 09, p=. 001) in the Italian context; the results are in line with Lausanne validation studies (Carneiro et al., 2006; Favez et al., 2006). Aim 2 : compared to the Lausanne longitudinal results Italian data show that the interactive competences displayed by the parental couple durign the pregnancy are predictive of family interactions after the baby's birth. In opposition with the Lausanne longitudinal results which show a relative interactions finding a linear relation between time and the family interactions (t= 4. 78; p =. 001) : there is an increase of 2, 35 points in each observational phase.

40|$|Siro-spinning (two-strand yarn spinning) is a {{new kind}} of {{modified}} ring spinning method, which is achieved by feeding two rovings into the apron zone at a predetermined separation simultaneously. There are three spinning <b>triangles,</b> including two <b>primary</b> spinning <b>triangles</b> and one final spinning triangle, in Siro-spinning. Therefore, in this paper, the quantitative relationships between the mechanical performance of a Siro-spinning triangle and the spinning parameters are investi-gated by using the Finite Element Method. The finite element model of the Siro-spinning triangle is constructed under the assumption in which the constituent fibers are considered as three-dimensional elastic beam elements with tensile, compressive, torsion, and bending capabilities. Three different cases where the ends of all fibers, the initial strain of all fibers, and the angle between any two adjacent fibers gripped in the front roller nip distribute evenly are discussed. Meanwhile, in each case, three different cases where the initial strains of the shortest boundary fiber, the central fiber, and the virtual fiber on the direction of yarn spinning tension are set as zero are discussed respectively. Then, taking the spinning triangle in Ne 40 (14. 6 tex) cotton Sirospun yarn as an example, the fiber tension distribution and fiber torsion distribution in the corresponding Siro-spinning triangle with and without fiber buckling are numerical simulated. It is shown that the fiber tension distributions are influenced by the setting of the fiber initial strain, while the magnitudes of fiber tension are not affected. Finally, Ne 40 cotton ring yarns were spun on an EJM 128 K ring spinning machine, and the properties of spun yarns were evaluated and analyzed according to the simulation results...|$|R
40|$|The color gamut, i. e. {{the range}} of {{reproducible}} colors, is in most conventional display systems not sufficient for accurate color reproduction of highly saturated colors. Any conventional three-primary display suffers from a color gamut limited within the triangle spanned by the primary colors. Even by using purer <b>primaries,</b> enlarging the <b>triangle,</b> {{there will still be}} a problem to cover all the perceivable colors. By using a system with more than three primary colors, in printing denoted Hi-Fi color, the gamut will be expanded into a polygon, yielding a larger gamut and better color reproduction. Digital Light Processing (DLP) is a projection technology developed by Texas Instrument. It uses a chip with an array of thousands of individually controllable micromirrors, each representing a single pixel in the projected image. A lamp illuminates the micromirrors, and by controlling the amount of time each mirror reflect the light, using pulse width modulation, the projected image is created. Color reproduction is achieved by letting the light pass through color filters, corresponding to the three primaries, mounted in a filter wheel. In this diploma work, the DLP projector InFocus® LP™ 350 has been evaluated, using the Photo Research® PR®- 705 Spectroradiometer. The colorimetric performance of the projector is found to be surprisingly poor, with a color gamut noticeably smaller then that of a CRT monitor using standardized phosphors. This is due to the broad banded filters used, yielding increased brightness {{at the expense of the}} pureness of the primaries. With the intention of evaluating the potential for the DLP technology in multi- primary systems, color filters are selected for additional primary colors. The filters are selected from a set of commercially available filters, the Kodak Wratten filters for science and technology. Used as performance criteria for filter selection is the volume of the gamut in the CIE 1976 (L*u*v*) uniform color space. The selected filters are measured and evaluated in combination with the projector, verifying the theoretical results from the filter selection process. Colorimetric performance of the system is greatly improved, yielding an expansion of the color gamut in CIE 1976 (L*u*v*) color space by 79 %, relative the original three-primary system. These results indicate the potential for DLP in multiprimary display systems, with the capacity to greatly expand the color gamut, by using carefully selected filters for additional primary colors...|$|R
