5|$|On 7 January 1904 Joyce {{attempted}} to publish A <b>Portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Artist,</b> an essay-story dealing with aesthetics, {{only to have}} it rejected by the free-thinking magazine Dana. He decided, on his twenty-second birthday, to revise the story into a novel he called Stephen Hero. It was a fictional rendering of Joyce's youth, but he eventually grew frustrated with its direction and abandoned this work. It was never published in this form, but years later, in Trieste, Joyce completely rewrote it as A <b>Portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Artist</b> as a Young Man. The unfinished Stephen Hero was published after his death.|$|E
5|$|The villanelle {{written by}} Stephen Dedalus, {{the protagonist of}} James Joyce's novel A <b>Portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Artist</b> as a Young Man. It {{has been the subject}} of several {{critical}} analyses.|$|E
5|$|A <b>Portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Artist</b> as a Young Man is {{a nearly}} {{complete}} rewrite {{of the abandoned}} novel Stephen Hero. Joyce attempted to burn the original manuscript {{in a fit of}} rage during an argument with Nora, though to his subsequent relief it was rescued by his sister. A Künstlerroman, Portrait is a heavily autobiographical coming-of-age novel depicting the childhood and adolescence of protagonist Stephen Dedalus and his gradual growth into artistic self-consciousness. Some hints of the techniques Joyce frequently employed in later works, such as stream of consciousness, interior monologue, and references to a character's psychic reality rather than to his external surroundings are evident throughout this novel.|$|E

5|$|Thomas was an {{accomplished}} writer of prose poetry, with collections such as <b>Portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Artist</b> as a Young Dog (1940) and Quite Early One Morning (1954) showing {{he was capable}} of writing moving short stories. His first published prose work was After the Fair, printed in The New English Weekly on 15 March 1934. Jacob Korg believes that Thomas's fiction work can be classified into two main bodies, vigorous fantasies in a poetic style and, after 1939, more straightforward narratives. Korg surmises that Thomas approached his prose writing as an alternate poetic form, which allowed him to produce complex, involuted narratives that do not allow the reader to rest.|$|E
5|$|In 1939 The Map of Love {{appeared}} {{as a collection of}} 16 poems and seven of the 20 short stories published by Thomas in magazines since 1934. Ten stories in his next book, <b>Portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Artist</b> as a Young Dog (1940), were based less on lavish fantasy than The Map of Love and more on real-life romances featuring himself in Wales. Sales of both books were poor, resulting in Thomas living on meagre fees from writing and reviewing. At this time he borrowed heavily from friends and acquaintances. Hounded by creditors, Thomas and his family left Laugharne in July 1940 and moved to the home of critic John Davenport in Marshfield, Gloucestershire. There Thomas collaborated with Davenport on the satire The Death of the King's Canary, though due to fears of libel the work was not published until 1976.|$|E
5|$|Pound's {{editorial}} {{choices were}} {{based on what he}} saw as the degree of sympathy that these writers displayed with Imagist precepts, rather than active participation in a group as such. Williams, who was based in the United States, had not participated in any of the discussions of the Eiffel Tower group. However, he and Pound had long been corresponding {{on the question of the}} renewal of poetry along similar lines. Ford was included at least partly because of his strong influence on Pound, as the younger poet made the transition from his earlier, Pre-Raphaelite-influenced style towards a harder, more modern way of writing. The inclusion of a poem by Joyce, I Hear an Army, which was sent to Pound by W.B. Yeats, took on a wider importance in the history of literary modernism, as the subsequent correspondence between the two led to the serial publication, at Pound's behest, of A <b>Portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Artist</b> as a Young Man in The Egoist. Joyce's poem is not written in free verse, but in rhyming quatrains. However, it strongly reflects Pound's interest in poems written to be sung to music, such as those by the troubadours and Guido Cavalcanti. The book met with little popular or critical success, at least partly because it had no introduction or commentary to explain what the poets were attempting to do, and a number of copies were returned to the publisher.|$|E

25|$|Belvedere College is the {{backdrop}} for much of James Joyce's novel A <b>Portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Artist</b> as a Young Man.

25|$|James Joyce’s novel A <b>Portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Artist</b> as a Young Man is {{partially}} set in UCD (when it was sited on Earlsfort Terrace) where Stephen Dedalus (now {{the name of}} the IT building) is enrolled as a student. Joyce's posthumously-published autobiographical novel Stephen Hero contains stories of his time in UCD. Flann O'Brien’s novel At Swim-Two-Birds features a UCD student who writes a meta-novel wherein the author is put on trial by the characters of his novel. Maeve Binchy's novel, Circle of Friends, deals with three female friends starting college in UCD in the 1950s. However, shots of Trinity College were used in the 1995 film. The second Ross O'Carroll-Kelly novel, The Teenage Dirtbag Years, follows Ross as he enters UCD.|$|E

500|$|The chapter headings, too, are all {{literary}} allusions. The first chapter, [...] "Old Father, Old Artificer," [...] {{refers to}} line in Joyce's A <b>Portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Artist</b> as a Young Man, and the second, [...] "A Happy Death," [...] invokes the Camus novel. [...] "That Old Catastrophe" [...] {{is a line}} from Wallace Stevens's [...] "Sunday Morning," [...] and [...] "In the Shadow of the Young Girls in Flower" [...] is the literal translation of the title {{of one of the}} volumes of Marcel Proust's In Search of Lost Time, which is usually given in English as Within a Budding Grove.|$|E
500|$|Desson Thomson of The Washington Post wrote, [...] "Depp is {{perfectly}} cast, Burton builds a surrealistically funny cul-de-sac world, {{and there are}} some very funny performances from grownups Dianne Wiest, Kathy Baker and Alan Arkin." [...] Rita Kempley of The Washington Post granted the film praise, [...] "Enchantment on the cutting edge, a dark yet heartfelt <b>portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> as a young mannequin." [...] She too praised Depp's performance in stating, [...] "... nicely cast, brings the eloquence of the silent era to this part of few words, saying it all through bright black eyes and the tremulous care with which he holds his horror-movie hands.|$|E

He became widely popular {{in his lifetime}} and remained so after his premature death {{at the age of}} 39 in New York City. By then he had acquired a reputation, which he had encouraged, as a [...] "roistering, drunken and doomed poet".|$|E
