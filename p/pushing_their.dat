5|$|Women {{did much}} to {{establish}} the fundamental elements of the social structure of the city, focusing their energies on families, schools, and churches during the city's pioneer days. Many of the organizations which created a modern urban scene were founded and led by middle class women. Through voluntary organizations and club work, they connected their city to national cultural and social trends. By the 1880s women in temperance and suffrage movements shifted the boundaries between private and public life in Dallas by <b>pushing</b> <b>their</b> way into politics {{in the name of}} social issues.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pushing</b> <b>their</b> {{way across}} the Bunga and Buiem Rivers, the 2/23rd fanned out through Apo village while {{maintaining}} contact with the 2/17th Infantry Battalion by signal cable. Around the Burep River, the 2/23rd was held up by the terrain {{and as a result}} the commander decided to halt and form a battalion defensive position. A platoon under Sergeant Don Lawrie was pushed forward near the mouth of the river as a protection measure to provide early warning. On 6 September, a company of Japanese attacked the 2/23rd's main defensive position south of the Singaua Plantation on the western side of the Buiem River, alongside a company from the 2/24th Battalion. Having been alerted by Lawrie's platoon who had sent back two runners, the battalion was able to repel the attack, although numerous casualties were inflicted on the 2/23rd and the 2/17th by Japanese mortars. The Japanese company, numbering about 60 men, subsequently fell back towards Lawrie's platoon near the Bunga. Positioned on the Japanese line of retreat, the Australian platoon was subjected to six attacks. These were fended off {{over the course of the}} afternoon, and by evening, as heavy rain began to fall, the Australian platoon was able to break contact and withdraw back to the 2/23rd's main defensive position.|$|E

25|$|In {{the morning}} of only the second day, a {{rebellion}} broke out among the volunteer prisoners. They ripped off their uniforms and locked themselves in their cells by <b>pushing</b> <b>their</b> beds up against the door. In response to this, the guards became very angry and called for backup. This surprised Zimbardo {{as well as the}} rest of the psychologists because they had not thought it would be taken this far. Guards who were not on duty were called in and the guards who were assigned to only the night shift stayed with the guards who came in all the way through their shift the next morning. The tactic the guards came up with was to fight back in order to discipline the unruly prisoners and make them obey. In response to the prisoners barricading themselves in their cells, the guards used fire extinguishers on them to get them away from the entrances.|$|E
25|$|The {{difficulty}} is that most turtle shells are rigid and do not allow {{for the type of}} expansion and contraction that other amniotes use to ventilate their lungs. Some turtles, such as the Indian flapshell (Lissemys punctata), have a sheet of muscle that envelops the lungs. When it contracts, the turtle can exhale. When at rest, the turtle can retract the limbs into the body cavity and force air out of the lungs. When the turtle protracts its limbs, the pressure inside the lungs is reduced, and the turtle can suck air in. Turtle lungs are attached {{to the inside of the}} top of the shell (carapace), with the bottom of the lungs attached (via connective tissue) to the rest of the viscera. By using a series of special muscles (roughly equivalent to a diaphragm), turtles are capable of <b>pushing</b> <b>their</b> viscera up and down, resulting in effective respiration, since many of these muscles have attachment points in conjunction with their forelimbs (indeed, many of the muscles expand into the limb pockets during contraction).|$|E
25|$|Circumstellar {{habitable}} zones {{change over}} time with stellar evolution. For example, hot O-type stars, which may remain on the main sequence for fewer than 10 million years, would have rapidly changing habitable zones not conducive {{to the development of}} life. Red dwarf stars, on the other hand, which can live for hundreds of billions of years on the main sequence, would have planets with ample time for life to develop and evolve. Even while stars are on the main sequence, though, their energy output steadily increases, <b>pushing</b> <b>their</b> habitable zones farther out; our Sun, for example, was 75% as bright in the Archaean as it is now, and in the future, continued increases in energy output will put Earth outside the Sun's habitable zone, even before it reaches the red giant phase. In order to deal with this increase in luminosity, the concept of a continuously habitable zone has been introduced. As the name suggests, the continuously habitable zone is a region around a star in which planetary-mass bodies can sustain liquid water for a given period of time. Like the general circumstellar habitable zone, the continuously habitable zone of a star is divided into a conservative and extended region.|$|E

500|$|A breaker boy was a coal-mining {{worker in}} the United States and United Kingdom whose job was to {{separate}} impurities from coal by hand in a coal breaker. Although breaker boys were primarily children, elderly coal miners who could no longer work in the mines because of age, disease, or accident were also sometimes employed as breaker boys. The use of breaker boys began around 1866. For 10 hours a day, six days a week, breaker boys would sit on wooden seats, perched over the chutes and conveyor belts, picking slate and other impurities out of the coal. Breaker boys working on top of chutes or conveyor belts would stop the coal by <b>pushing</b> <b>their</b> boots into the stream of fuel flowing beneath them, briefly pick out the impurities, and then let the coal pass {{on to the next}} breaker boy for further processing. Others would divert coal into a horizontal chute at which they sat, then pick the coal clean before allowing the fuel to flow into [...] "clean" [...] coal bins.|$|E
500|$|Napalm Death's seismic impact {{inspired}} other British grindcore {{groups in}} the 1980s, among them Extreme Noise Terror, Carcass and Sore Throat. Extreme Noise Terror, from Ipswich, formed in 1984. With the goal of becoming [...] "the most extreme hardcore punk band of all time," [...] the group took Mick Harris from Napalm Death in 1987. Ian Glasper describes the group as [...] "pissed-off hateful noise with its roots somewhere between early Discharge and Disorder, with [...] Dean [...] and Phil [...] <b>pushing</b> <b>their</b> trademark vocal extremity to its absolute limit." [...] In 1991, the group collaborated with the acid house group The KLF, appearing onstage with the group at the Brit Awards in 1992. Carcass released Reek of Putrefaction in 1988, which John Peel declared his favorite {{album of the year}} despite its very poor production. The band's focus on gore and anatomical decay, lyrically and in sleeve artwork, inspired the goregrind subgenre. Sore Throat, said by Ian Glasper to have taken [...] "perhaps the most uncompromisingly anti-music stance" [...] were inspired by crust punk as well as industrial music. Some listeners, such as Digby Pearson, considered them to be simply an in-joke or parody of grindcore.|$|E

500|$|Staci Krause of IGN had a {{positive}} outlook on the episode, mainly due to the heavy development the episode's plot had in the season's progressive arc. She described the storylines involving the cancer patient's intoxication and Ellis' lucidity as achieving a balance, and moving the show [...] "at a lightning quick pace". Krause deemed the episode [...] "stellar", noting how it avoided the possibility of having negative points. Regarding the episode an [...] "epic" [...] one, she praised the scene which depicts O'Malley realizing the intoxication provoked by the patient's blood. [...] "This is what we come to expect from medical dramas and it is great to see Grey's get back to this, while not sacrificing the personal stories", stated Krause, putting the emphasis on how [...] "this case brought out the hore in just about everyone, <b>pushing</b> <b>their</b> limits for a patient". Krause noted that O'Malley has developed into a hero, stating that [...] "pulling {{all the people in}} the operating room out, even though he was already sick and could have easily died from the effort" [...] in a comparison to Sloan, described as being a man with no appealing traits and [...] "unlikable ways", which attracted criticism from Krause.|$|E
500|$|Fights {{take place}} in both sexes and involve <b>pushing</b> <b>their</b> necks against each other or ramming into one another using horns. Fights can be gory; despite the {{protective}} skin deep, lacerated wounds and even deaths might occur. Display behaviour focuses on the throat patch and the beard, and threatening opponents by pointing the horns toward them. A young male was observed making a submissive display in the Sariska Reserve by kneeling before an adult male, who stood erect. The nilgai mark their territories by forming dung piles as much as [...] in radius. The defecation process is elaborate-the antelope stands with his legs about a metre apart, with the rump lowered and the tail held almost vertical; it stays in the same posture for at least ten seconds after relieving itself. The process is not as elaborate in the females {{as it is in}} the males.In India, the nilgai shares its habitat with the four-horned antelope, chinkara, chital and blackbuck; its association with the gaur and the water buffalo is less common. In the Ranthambore National Park (Rajasthan, India) the nilgai and the chinkara collectively prefer the area rich in Acacia and Butea species, while the sambar deer and the chital preferred the forests of Anogeissus and Grewia species. In India, the Indian tiger and the lion may prey on the nilgai but they are not significant predators of this antelope. Leopards prey on the nilgai, though they prefer smaller prey. Dholes generally attack juveniles. Other predators include wolves and striped hyenas.|$|E
500|$|Oxford won the toss for {{the third}} {{successive}} year and elected to start from the Surrey station, handing the Middlesex {{side of the river}} to Cambridge. [...] The race commenced at 1.17pm. [...] Despite the conditions favouring the Light Blues, Oxford were ahead from the start and led by two seconds the Mile Post in a record-equalling time of 3 minutes 47 seconds. [...] According to Legget, Cambridge [...] "were untidy and rather rushed". [...] Near Harrods Furniture Depository, the crews nearly clashed oars, but Oxford held firm and reached Hammersmith Bridge with a three-second lead. [...] Rounding the corner, Cambridge chose to stay on the tide, while Oxford headed for shelter towards the Surrey shore. [...] The Light Blues reduced the lead marginally but by Chiswick Steps, Oxford were six seconds ahead and moved back to the Middlesex shore, with Cambridge resolute in midstream. [...] Oxford briefly left the shelter of the shoreline to shoot Barnes Bridge through the centre arch, before heading back, with a lead of eight seconds. [...] Despite <b>pushing</b> <b>their</b> rating to 36 strokes per minute, Cambridge could not reduce the deficit, and as Oxford accelerated to a rating of 38, they passed the finishing post three-and-a-half lengths ahead, in a time of 18 minutes 52 seconds.
