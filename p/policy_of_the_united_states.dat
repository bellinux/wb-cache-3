5|$|Duhalde was {{appointed}} {{president in the}} aftermath of the September 11 attacks, when the foreign <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> was strictly focused on the War on Terror. Initially, the Argentine society was divided on how to manage the bilateral relations with the US. One group wanted to keep the close relations of the previous decade, as Argentina might need foreign help to deal with the crisis. The other group preferred to maintain more distant relations. Duhalde sought to strike a balance between both options, and eventually leaned towards the second when the US refused to help Argentina.|$|E
5|$|The {{part of the}} Sierra Nevada {{where the}} park is located was long {{considered}} to be a physical barrier to European American settlers, traders, trappers, and travelers. That situation changed in 1848 after gold was discovered in the foothills west of the range. Travel and trade activity dramatically increased in the area during the ensuing California Gold Rush. Resources depended upon by local Native Americans were depleted or destroyed, and disease brought by the newcomers spread rapidly through indigenous populations. Extermination of native culture became a <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> Government.|$|E

5|$|Bo {{presided over}} a {{continued}} rise in foreign investment in China as Minister of Commerce. His daily schedule was dominated by receiving foreign guests and dignitaries. By {{the time that he}} became Minister, he spoke relatively fluent and colloquial English. During a meeting with American officials, Bo reputedly told a struggling interpreter to stop translating because the Chinese officials could understand English and it was wasting time. In May 2004 Bo {{was one of the few}} ministers hand-picked to accompany Premier Wen Jiabao on a five-country trip to Europe. The trade <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> toward China also sparked significant controversy. Bo maintained a conciliatory but assertive attitude as he attended talks in Washington. On his trips to the United States, he conducted substantive discussions with his American counterparts and signed agreements on intellectual property, the services sector, agricultural products, food safety, and consumer protection.|$|E
5|$|The {{powers of}} the President {{in the conduct of}} foreign {{relations}} included the power, without consent of the Senate, to determine the public <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> with respect to the Russian nationalization decrees. What government is to be regarded here as representative of a foreign sovereign state is a political rather than a judicial question, and is to be determined by the political department of the government. That authority is not limited to a determination of the government to be recognized. It includes the power to determine the policy which is to govern the question of recognition. Objections to the underlying policy as well as objections to recognition are to be addressed to the political department and not to the courts.|$|E
5|$|The Council on Foreign Relations {{began in}} 1917 {{with a group}} of New York {{academics}} who were asked by President Woodrow Wilson to offer options for the foreign <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> in the interwar period. Originally envisioned as a group of American and British scholars and diplomats, some of whom belonging to the Round Table movement, it was a subsequent group of 108 New York financiers, manufacturers and international lawyers organized in June 1918 by Nobel Peace Prize recipient and U.S. secretary of state Elihu Root, that became the Council on Foreign Relations on 29 July 1921. The first of the council’s projects was a quarterly journal launched in September 1922, called Foreign Affairs. The Trilateral Commission was founded in July 1973, at the initiative of American banker David Rockefeller, who was chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations at that time. It is a private organization established to foster closer cooperation among the United States, Europe and Japan. The Trilateral Commission is widely seen as a counterpart to the Council on Foreign Relations.|$|E
