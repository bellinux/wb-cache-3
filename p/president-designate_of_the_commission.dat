40|$|Chinese text {{segmentation}} is {{a well-known}} and difficult problem. On one side, {{there is not a}} simple notion of "word" in Chinese language making really hard to implement rule-based systems to segment written texts, thus lexicons and statistical information are usually employed to achieve such a task. On the other side, any piece of Chinese text usually includes segments present neither in the lexicons nor in the training data. Even worse, such unseen sequences can be segmented into a number of totally unrelated words making later processing phases difficult. For instance, using a lexicon-based system the sequence ???(Baluozuo, Barroso, current <b>president-designate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European <b>Commission)</b> can be segmented into ?(ba, to hope, to wish) and ??(luozuo, an undefined word) changing completely <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sentence. A new and extremely simple algorithm specially suited to work over short Chinese documents is introduced. This new algorithm performs text "self-segmentation" producing results comparable to those achieved by native speakers without using either lexicons or any statistical information beyond the obtained from the input text. Furthermore, it is really robust for finding new "words", especially proper nouns, and it is well suited to build lexicons from scratch. Some preliminary results are provided in addition to examples of its employment. Comment: 9 pages 3 figures 2 table...|$|R

40|$|Excerpt from preface: <b>The</b> present {{collection}} <b>of</b> articles {{follows from}} a one-day seminar The Biological Weapons Convention, Biosecurity and the Industry organised by the Belgian Foreign Ministry in Brussels on 20 June 2011. Among the attendants were Belgian and European {{representatives from the}} life sciences, the biosafety and -security community, and the pharmaceutical industry, as well as Belgian Government officials involved with disarmament. Ambassador Paul van den IJssel, <b>President-Designate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 7 th BTWC Review Conference, closed <b>the</b> proceedings. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seminar’s central themes was to investigate how the life sciences industry – one core stakeholder remaining wholly in <b>the</b> background <b>of</b> <b>the</b> discussions on <b>the</b> future <b>of</b> <b>the</b> BTWC – could become more involved. Speakers from the aforementioned communities zoomed in on industrial standards for biosafety and biosecurity being developed for laboratories in research and industry facilities as a possible point of entry. In follow up to the seminar, the idea arose to explore this lesser-known opportunity in more detail and highlight its possibilities and limitations from three different perspectives: biorisk management, industry practice and government responsibility in formal disarmament. The Belgian Royal Institute for International Relations Egmont agreed to publish the contributions in its Egmont Papers series {{in collaboration with the}} European Union Institute for Security Studies...|$|R
