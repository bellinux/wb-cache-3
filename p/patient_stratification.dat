50|$|A peptide {{microarray}} (also {{commonly known}} as peptide chip or peptide epitope microarray) {{is a collection of}} peptides displayed on a solid surface, usually a glass or plastic chip. Peptide chips are used by scientists in biology, medicine and pharmacology to study binding properties and functionality and kinetics of protein-protein interactions in general. In basic research, peptide microarrays are often used to profile an enzyme (like kinase, phosphatase, protease, acetyltransferase, histone deacetylase etc.), to map an antibody epitope or to find key residues for protein binding. Practical applications are seromarker discovery, profiling of changing humoral immune responses of individual patients during disease progression, monitoring of therapeutic interventions, <b>patient</b> <b>stratification</b> and development of diagnostic tools and vaccines.|$|E
5000|$|SHS is {{associated}} with cardiovascular risk factors and contributes {{to the development of}} cardiovascular disease. SHS should be recognized in the health care system, especially in primary care. A correlation between SHS and systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, plasma glucose, total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol among men, and a correlation between SHS and systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, triglycerides and HDL cholesterol among women were found. The SHSQ-25 is a self-rated questionnaire of perceived health complaints, which {{can be used as a}} new instrument for predictive, preventive and personalized medicine (PPPM). An ongoing longitudinal SHS cohort survey (China Sub-optimal Health Cohort Study, COACS) consisting of 50,000 participants will provide a powerful health trial to use SHSQ-25 for its application to PPPM through <b>patient</b> <b>stratification</b> and therapy monitoring using innovative technologies of predictive diagnostics and prognosis: an effort of paradigm shift from reactive to predictive medicine. [...] one study also confirmed the association between chronic psychosocial stress and SHS, indicating that improving the psychosocial work environment may reduce SHS and then prevent chronic diseases effectively. [...] SHS {{is associated}} with endothelial dysfunction. Integration of suboptimal health status and endothelial dysfunction provides a novel tool to allow people to get a more holistic picture of both subjective and objective health measures, and also can be applied to routine screening for risks of cardiovascular diseases. To investigate the causative effect of SHS in non-communicable chronic diseases (NCD), China suboptimal health cohort study (COACS), a longitudinal study starting from 2013 was initiated. Phase I of the study involved a cross-sectional survey aimed at identifying the risk/protective factors associated with SHS; and Phase II: a longitudinal yearly follow-up study investigating how SHS contributes to the incidence and pattern of NCD.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{isolation}} of multi-drug-resistant gram-negative (MDRGN) pathogens has progressively increased worldwide {{and has been}} associated with important delays in the prescription of an adequate antibiotic treatment, resulting in increased mortality rates. <b>Patient’s</b> <b>stratification</b> for MDRGN infections to optimize the prescription of an adequate empiric antimicrobial regimen is crucial. Areas covered: This article covers MDRGN epidemiology, with a specific focus on risk factors for harbouring infections sustained by extended-spectrum-Beta-lactamase (ESBL), carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriacae (CRE), MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa and MDR Acinetobacter baumanii. Moreover, we will propose an algorithm for the choice of empiric treatment when a MDRGN infection is suspected.

40|$|Abstract: In {{the last}} decades, cardiac {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) has gained acceptance in cardiology community as an accurate and reproducible diagnostic imaging modality in patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD). In particular, in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) cardiac MRI study allows a comprehensive assessment of the pattern of ischemic injury in term of reversible and irreversible damage, myocardial hemorrhage and microvascular obstruction (MVO). Myocardial salvage index, derived by quantification of myocardium (area) at risk and infarction, has become a promising surrogate end-point increasingly used in clinical trials testing novel or adjunctive reperfusion strategies. Early post-infarction, the accurate and reproducible quantification of myocardial necrosis, along with the characterization of ischemic myocardial damage in its diverse components, provides important information to predict post-infarction left ventricular (LV) remodeling, being useful for <b>patients</b> <b>stratification</b> and management. Considering its non-invasive nature, cardiac MRI suits well for investigating {{the time course of}} infarct healing and the changes occurring in peri-infarcted (adjacent) and remote myocardium, which ultimately promote the geometrical, morphological and functional abnormalities of the entire left ventricle (global LV remodeling).

40|$|Regorafenib {{monotherapy}} is {{a potential}} option for metastatic colorectal cancer patients. However, the lack of predictive factors and the severe toxicities related to treatment have made its use in clinical practice challenging. Polymorphisms of VEGF and its receptor (VEGFR) genes might regulate angiogenesis and thus potentially influence outcome during anti-angiogenesis treatment such as regorafenib. Aim of our study was to evaluate the role of VEGF and VEGFR genotyping in determining clinical outcome for colorectal cancer patients receiving regorafenib. We retrospectively collected clinical data and samples (tumour or blood) of 138 metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with regorafenib. We analysed the correlation of different VEGF-A, VEGF-C and VEGFR- 1, 2, 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with patients' progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results from angiogenesis genotyping showed that only VEGF-A rs 2010963 maintained an independent correlation with PFS and OS. Among clinical factors only ECOG PS was independently correlated with OS, whereas no correlation with PFS was evident.
