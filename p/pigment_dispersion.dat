40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{stabilization}} of <b>pigment</b> <b>dispersions.</b> In all applications of pigments {{a high degree of}} dispersion is required, that the pigments can gain their best properties, such as coverage, colour and glance. The stabilization of <b>pigment</b> <b>dispersions,</b> i. e. means avoiding an aggregation and flocculation, is a basic requirement for optimal coating properties. The stabilization of <b>pigment</b> <b>dispersions</b> can be achieved by electrostatic, steric and electrosteric mechanisms. In electrostatic stabilization, which is mostly used in aqueous media, the surface charge (zeta potential) and the double layer of the particles play an important role. The electrostatic interaction between particles and the mechanism of the electrostatic stabilization is described by the theory of Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey and Overbeek (DLVO theory). According the DLVO theory an efficient repulsion between the particles is achieved, when particles bear the same high surface charge and have an extended double layer. This can be achieved by adjusting the system pH and ionic strength of the dispersion or by modifying the particle surface with inorganic oxides. Due to the lower surface charge of particles in organic media, here pigments are stabilized by adding polymer to the dispersion. If polymer is adsorbed onto the particle surface, the approach of such modified particles is avoided for entropic reasons (steric stabilization). In depletion stabilization, where an excess of polymer is added to the dispersion, the polymer does not adsorb onto the particle and the pigment is stabilized by osmotic effects, that occur with an approach of particles.

40|$|In {{comparison}} to weaving or other techniques that are employed to embed conductive tracks in textile fabric structure, the obvious advantages of printing the desired conductive pattern are {{the simplicity of}} the process and the suitability for low volume production runs as well as high volume production runs. However, the generally inferior durability and poorer electrical performance of conductive inks that have been printed onto a textile fabric give rise to challenges. In this study, electrically conductive grades of carbon black pigment were used to formulate screen printing inks for use on textiles. On an equal weight basis, electrically conductive grades impart higher electrical conductivity compared to the printing ink grades of carbon black pigment. However, the conductive grades of carbon black are difficult to disperse and stabilise in aqueous media. Therefore in this study, a procedure was devised initially to prepare stable, waterborne dispersions of a number of highly conductive grades of carbon black pigment.

50|$|The chief {{purpose of}} <b>pigment</b> <b>dispersion</b> {{is to break}} down {{aggregates}} and form stable dispersions of optimally sized pigment particles. This process generally involves three distinct stages: wetting, deaggregation, and stabilization. A surface that is easy to wet is desirable when formulating a coating that requires good adhesion and appearance. This also minimizes the risks of surface tension related defects, such as crawling, catering, and orange peel. This is an essential requirement for pigment dispersions; for wetting to be effective, the surface tension of the vehicle must be lower than the surface free energy of the pigment. This allows the vehicle to penetrate into the interstices of the pigment aggregates, thus ensuring complete wetting. Finally, the particles are subjected to a repulsive force {{in order to keep}} them separated from one another and lowers the likelihood of flocculation.|$|E

The composition and properties of the paint components were analyzed: the pigments by measurement of BET-isotherms and zetapotentials; the polymer dispersions by GPC-, PCS-, PCD-, zetapotential- and turbidity measurement; the dispersing and thickening additives by IR-and 1 H-NMR-spectroscopy. The interactions between the pigments and the additives were examined by the change of their zetapotential at different additive concentrations. It appeared that {{the properties of the}} <b>pigment</b> <b>dispersions</b> are determined by an interaction with the thickener. This interaction depends on the surface properties of the pigment and the chemical composition of the dispersant. In the case of the dispersant applied in the formulation an interaction of the thickening additive with the <b>pigment</b> <b>dispersions</b> appeared only below the isoelectric point (IEP) of the pigments. Charge neutralization and the adsorption of the thickening additive favoures a sterical mechanism of the stabilization in this pH-area. A pressure-induced agglomeration of the TiO 2 -pigments below their IEP was proved by determination the change of the colour of the paint during shear and pumping experiments. Above the IEP no change of the colour appeared because of the additional electrostatic repulsion. The formulation could be optimized by a pigment exchange very elegantly without changing the concentrations of the raw materials and the pH-value of the paint system. Production disturbances could be minimized by a modification of the order in the production process on account of the qualities of the polymer dispersions and the additives. The use of a new high pressure homogenizer in the grinding step effectively increased the colour strength of the paint with the same pigmentation height (about 50 %) which leads to economic advantages...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Pigment</b> <b>dispersion</b> {{syndrome}} (PDS) is an affliction of the {{eye that}} can lead to a form of glaucoma known as pigmentary glaucoma. It takes place when pigment cells slough off {{from the back of the}} iris and float around in the aqueous humor. Over time, these pigment cells can accumulate in the anterior chamber in such a way that it can begin to clog the trabecular meshwork (the major site of aqueous humour drainage), which can in turn prevent the aqueous humour from draining and therefore increases the pressure inside the eye. With PDS, the intraocular pressure tends to spike at times and then can return to normal. Exercise has been shown to contribute to spikes in pressure as well. When the pressure is great enough to cause damage to the optic nerve, this is called pigmentary glaucoma. As with all types of glaucoma, when damage happens to the optic nerve fibers, the vision loss that occurs is irreversible and painless.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Inside {{bluegill}} (Lepomis macrochirus) retinal pigment epithelial cells, pigment granules move {{in response}} to extracellular signals. During the process of aggregation, pigment motility is directed toward the cell nucleus; in <b>dispersion,</b> <b>pigment</b> is directed away from the nucleus and into long apical processes. A number of different chemicals {{have been found to}} initiate dispersion, and carbachol (an acetylcholine analog) is one example. Previous research indicates that the carbachol-receptor interaction activates a G q -mediated pathway which is commonly linked to Ca 2 + mobilization. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to test for involvement of calcium and to probe calcium-dependent mediators to reveal their role in carbachol-mediated <b>dispersion.</b> Results Carbachol-induced <b>pigment</b> granule <b>dispersion</b> was blocked by the calcium chelator BAPTA. In contrast, the calcium channel antagonist verapamil, and incubation in Ca 2 + -free medium failed to block carbachol-induced dispersion. The calcineurin inhibitor cypermethrin blocked carbachol-induced dispersion; whereas, two protein kinase C inhibitors (staurosporine and bisindolylmaleimide II) failed to block carbachol-induced dispersion, and the protein kinase C activator phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate failed to elicit dispersion. Conclusion A rise in intracellular calcium is necessary for carbachol-induced dispersion; however, the Ca 2 + requirement is not dependent on extracellular sources, implying that intracellular stores are sufficient to enable <b>pigment</b> granule <b>dispersion</b> to occur. Calcineurin is a likely Ca 2 + -dependent mediator involved in the signal cascade. Although the pathway leads to the generation of diacylglycerol and calcium (both required for the activation of certain PKC isoforms), our evidence does not support a significant role for PKC. </p...|$|R

M., and L. T. Haimo. 1986. Cell. 47 : 1061 - 1070). The present studies suggest that calcineurin, a Ca 2 +/calmodulin- stimulated phosphatase, is the endogenous phosphatase that mediates pigment aggregation in melanophores. Aggregation, but not dispersion, is inhibited by okadaic acid at concentrations consistent with an inhibition of calcineurin activity. Inhibition of aggregation in melanophores that have been BAPTA loaded or treated with calmodulin antagonists implicate Ca 2 + and calmodulin, respectively, in this process. Moreover, addition of calcineurin rescues aggregation in lysed melanophores which are otherwise incapable of aggregating pigment. Immunoblotting with an anticalcineurin IgG reveals that calcineurin is a component of the dermis, which contains the melanophores, and indirect immunofluorescence localizes calcineurin specifically to the melanophores.
