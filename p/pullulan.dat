40|$|Background: Members of this genus Aureobasidium are {{ubiquitous}} microorganisms {{which can}} be isolated from wide ranges of substrates such as plant materials (phyllosphere, plant debris, bark, roots, fruits and wood), soil, dead wood, air, and as rare etiologic agent of pheohyphomycosis, keratomycosis, septicemia, peritoneal sepsis, and dermatological infections in human. Very little is known on the identity, substrates and distribution of Aureobasidium spp. in Iran. Materials and Methods: Fourteen Aureobasidium isolates were recovered from vascular tissues of pome and stone fruit trees displaying decline symptoms in orchards of West and East Azarbaijan provinces, Iran. Pure cultures were established by using a single spore technique. The identity of the isolates was determined using sequence data from ITS-rDNA region. Phylogenetic relationship among isolates was inferred based on sequence data from ITS-rDNA. Results: A megablast search analysis of ITS sequence data at NCBI revealed the identity of Aureobasidium isolates as A. <b>pullulans.</b> A phylogeny inferred using sequence data from ITS region placed our isolates together with the other A. <b>pullulans</b> var. <b>pullulans</b> in GenBank.

40|$|The {{abundance}} of phylloplane microorganisms typically varies over several {{orders of magnitude}} among leaves sampled concurrently. Because the methods traditionally used to sample leaves are destructive, it has remained unclear whether this high variability is due to fixed differences in habitat quality among leaves or to asynchronous temporal variation in the microbial population density on individual leaves. We developed a novel semidestructive assay to repeatedly sample the same apple leaves from orchard trees over time by removing progressively more proximal ∼ 1 -cm-wide transverse segments. Aureobasidium <b>pullulans</b> densities were determined by standard leaf homogenization and plating procedures and were expressed as CFU per square centimeter of segment. The A. <b>pullulans</b> population densities among leaves were lognormally distributed. The variability in A. <b>pullulans</b> population densities among subsections of a given leaf was one-third to one-ninth the variability among whole leaves harvested concurrently. Sequential harvesting of leaf segments {{did not result in}} detectable changes in A. <b>pullulans</b> density on residual leaf surfaces. These findings implied that we could infer whole-leaf A. <b>pullulans</b> densities over time by using partial leaves. When this successive sampling regimen was applied over the course of multiple 7 - to 8 -day experiments, the among-leaf effects were virtually always the predominant source of variance in A. <b>pullulans</b> density estimates. Changes in A. <b>pullulans</b> density tended to be synchronous among leaves, such that the rank order of leaves arrayed with respect to A. <b>pullulans</b> density was largely maintained through time. Occasional periods of asynchrony were observed, but idiosyncratic changes in A. <b>pullulans</b> density did not contribute appreciably to variation in the distribution of populations among leaves. This suggests that persistent differences in habitat (leaf) quality are primarily responsible for the variation in A. <b>pullulans</b> density among leaves in nature...|$|R

40|$|Aureobasidium <b>pullulans</b> is {{generally}} {{believed to be}} the main causal organism of the disfigurement of wood in service and coatings applied to wood. The disfigurement is referred to as blue stain in service. As such it represents a major problem to the paint industry and to the use of timber as a decorative product in service. Fifty two test strains and environmental isolates of blue stain fungi were collated to study the morphology, physiology and phylogeny ofA. <b>pullulans.</b> Sequencing of the rDNA 5. 8 S gene and flanking ITS regions was successful in unequivocally discriminating between the two morphologically similar blue stain fungi: A. <b>pullulans</b> and H. dematioides. The phylogenetic tree based on the rDNA sequence data confirmed that A. <b>pullulans</b> is a single species and {{there is no evidence of}} any subspecies from this region of DNA. RAPD analysis was used to investigate intraspecific genetic variability, but the technique was not successful in being able to differe,uiate accurately between these two fungi. However, different banding patterns were observed, suggesting there was a degree of genetic variability. The sequencing data highlighted many cases of misidentification of H. dematioides as A. <b>pullulans</b> from environmental isolations. The difficulty in correctly distinguishing morphologically between A. <b>pullulans</b> and H. dematioides b!'ought into question the conclusion that A. <b>pullulans</b> was the most commonly isolated and thus the main causal organism of blue stain in service. The actual frequency of occurrence of blue stain fungi in stained wood was investigated using PCR-DGGE analysis of environmental DNA samples. The use ofPCR-DGGE gave an insight into the actual fungi present at the time of sampling and gave a molecular snapshot of the blue stain community present on the stained timber samples. The PCR-DGGE analysis showed conclusively that H. dematioides was detected more frequently than A. <b>pullulans.</b> The results also show that PCR-DGGE, with a suitable primer set, is able to differentiate and partially quantify A. <b>pullulans</b> and H. dematioides in environmental samples. Quantitative analysis of A. <b>pullulans</b> was attempted from a new perspective using direct RNA analysis, in the form ofqPCR, to assess the active biomass ofA. <b>pullulans</b> in stained wood. The results showed the relatively constant levels ofmRNA of the two target genes over the eight week time period of the experiment and demonstrated the effectiveness of the RNA extraction procedure in harvesting extremely small amounts of viable RNA from wood. A method ofcontroIling blue stain fungi was investigated by attempting to reduce the number ofA. <b>pullulans</b> spores adhering to four different wood coatings, namely; a solvent based paint, a water based paint, a solvent based wood stain and a water based wood stain. These coatings were tested both before and after artificial weathering. The inhibition ofspore adhesion follows the tenet of prevention rather than cure and is particularly significant given the current environmental pressures on the coatings industry regarding the use ofbiocides to control these fungi. The main aim of the adhesion study was to examine ifzosteric acid could prevent the adhesion ofA. <b>pullulans</b> spores to wood coatings. Zosteric acid was shown to significantly reduce the adhesive capability ofA. <b>pullulans</b> spores on the four different wood coatings and weathering was shown to significantly increase the adhesion ofspores to the coatings. There is potential for utilising the reduction in spore adhesion observed with zosteric acid by its incorporation into paint formulations. Such an approach has great attraction as zosteric acid is a naturally occurring, non-toxic chemical in contrast to the current use of controlled biocides.

Therefore, it is very important how to develop an economical process for a large scale production of PMA by one step fermentation. Results: After over 200 strains of Aureobasidium spp. isolated from the mangrove systems in the South of China were screened for their ability to produce Ca 2 +‑polymalate (PMA), it was found that Aureobasidium <b>pullulans</b> var. <b>pullulans</b> MCW strain among them could produce high level of Ca 2 +‑PMA. The medium containing only 140. 0 g/L glucose, 65. 0 g/L CaCO 3 and 7. 5 g/L corn steep liquor was found to be the most suitable for Ca 2 +‑PMA production. Then, 121. 3 g/L of Ca 2 +‑PMA was produced by A. <b>pullulans</b> var. <b>pullulans</b> MCW strain within 120 h at flask level. During 10 ‑L batch fermentation, 152. 52 g/L of Ca 2 +‑PMA in the culture and 8. 6 g/L of cell dry weight were obtained within 96 h, leaving 4. 5 g/L of reducing sugar in the fermented medium. After purification of the Ca 2 +‑PMA from the culture and acid hydrolysis of the purified Ca 2 +‑PMA, HPLC analysis showed that A. <b>pullulans</b> var. <b>pullulans</b> MCW strain produced only one main component of Ca 2 +‑PMA and the hydrolysate of the purified Ca 2 +‑PMA was mainly composed of l‑malic acid.

A. pullulans`s beta-glucosidase was more pH stable (4. 5 - 10. 0 against 4. 5 - 8. 0) and more thermostable (90 % after 1 h at 75 degrees C against 85 % after 1 h at 70 degrees C) than the enzyme from the thermophilic T. aurantiacus.
