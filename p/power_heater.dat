In this paper, the steady state optimum distribution of <b>heater</b> <b>power</b> is searched by numerical optimization in order to get uniform sheet temperature. In the following step, optimal <b>heater</b> <b>power</b> distribution with a damaged heater was found out using the technology of fault tolerance, which will be used to reduce the repairing time when some heaters are damaged.

40|$|The {{results are}} {{presented}} of an experimental study of nucleate pool boiling performed in the low gravity environment of the space shuttle. Photographic observations of pool boiling in Freon 113 were obtained during the 'Tank Pressure Control Experiment', flown on the Space Transportation System STS- 43 in August 1991. Nucleate boiling data from large (relative to bubble size) flat heating surfaces (0. 1046 by 0. 0742 m) was obtained at very low heat fluxes (0. 22 to 1. 19 kw/so m). The system pressure and the bulk liquid subcooling varied {{in the range of}} 40 to 60 kPa and 3 to 5 C respectively. Thirty-eight boiling tests, each of 10 min duration for a given heat flux, were conducted. Measurements included the heater <b>power,</b> <b>heater</b> surface temperature, the liquid temperature and the system pressure as functions of heating time. Video data of the first 2 min of heating was recorded for each test. In some tests the video clearly shows the inception of boiling and the growth and departure of bubbles from the surface during the first 2 min of heating. In the absence of video data, the heater temperature variation during heating shows the inception of boiling and stable nucleate boiling. During the stable nucleate boiling, the wall superheat varied between 2. 8 to 3. 8 C for heat fluxes in the range of 0. 95 to 1. 19 kw/so m. The wall superheat at the inception of boiling varied between 2 to 13 C...|$|E
40|$|Artificial ionospheric {{modification}} experiments {{by means}} of high power, high frequency radio waves using the EISCAT (European Incoherent SCATter) heater at Tromsø, northern Norway {{have been carried out}} for nearly three decades. These experiments are associated with large-scale increases in the electron temperature and density and generation of small-scale plasma irregularities, which are diagnosed by the EISCAT UHF and CUTLASS (Cooperative UK Twin Located Auroral Sounding System) HF radars. Experimental results from the EISCAT UHF radar, obtained from heating campaigns at Tromsø between 1996 and 1999, are used to study the effects of heater-induced instabilities on the analyses of EISCAT spectra. Plasma turbulence induced by high <b>power</b> <b>heater</b> waves produces unphysical estimates of ionospheric plasma parameters during the initial phase of heating, and a method is developed to correct for these problems. It is shown that these estimates are nevertheless, reliable over longer timescales of heating. In the second study, relaxation characteristics of small-scale density perturbations measured using the CUTLASS Finland radar are modelled theoretically and shown to be largely consistent with large-scale temperatures measured using the EISCAT UHF radar. Certain cases are identified where alternative models of irregularity decay are required to describe the temporal behaviour in radar backscatter. These models consider influences such as electron temperature reductions, wave-wave coupling and background flow. The final study concentrates on a heating experiment in October 2000, where unusually broadened spectral widths of artificial HF backscatter measured with the CUTLASS Finland and Iceland radars was observed. The results were incompatible with previous explanations of similar observations. The Burg maximum entropy analysis was implemented to formulate a tentative explanation for the observations, involving simultaneous detection of artificial and natural irregularity echoes by the Iceland radar. This required the heater amplification of non co-located natural irregularities, already above the noise threshold of the radar. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|It is {{demonstrated}} that the output of a 2. 45 -GHz magnetron operated as a current-controlled oscillator through its pushing characteristic can lock to injection signals in times {{of the order of}} 100 - 500 ns depending on injection <b>power,</b> magnetron <b>heater</b> <b>power,</b> load impedance, and frequency offset of the injection frequency from the natural frequency of the magnetron.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) process is a widely established Rapid Manufacturing technology that offers various possibilities not available from other production techniques. The application of SLS {{in the creation of}} products such as shoe outsoles has led to a requirement for compression property data and an understanding of the factors that influence it. This research investigated the effect of sintering temperature on the compression modulus and strength of SLS nylon- 12 parts. Three parameters were used to vary the sintering temperature. These were laser <b>power,</b> part <b>heater</b> set point and powder bed location. An increase in laser <b>power</b> or part <b>heater</b> set point led to an increase sintering temperature. The higher temperature areas within the powder bed also led to higher sintering temperatures. Consequently, this caused an increase in compression properties.

40|$|The {{main body}} of work {{presented}} in this thesis is precise frequency and phase control of a 1. 2 kW CW cooker magnetron (National 2 M 137) locked to a 10 MHz reference injected with a very small RF signal (of the order of - 40 dBc) creating a suitable RF source for particle accelerators and other sophisticated applications. We {{will go on to}} discuss the characterization of the magnetron with differing <b>heater</b> <b>powers</b> and load conditions when operated with a low cost switched mode power supply. We similarly identify three different regimes of the magnetron operation with respect to the heater power: firstly low noise operation for small <b>heater</b> <b>powers</b> (up to 15 W), secondly unstable operation for mid-range <b>heater</b> <b>powers</b> (15 W to 30 W) and thirdly high noise operation at high <b>heater</b> <b>powers</b> (30 W to 54 W). We then introduce a novel method to lock the magnetron output frequency to the 10 MHz reference using a digital frequency synthesizer IC (Analog Devices ADF 4113) in a negative feedback loop, with this method we exploit the use of the pushing mechanism where the ADF 41113 controls the power supply output to vary the magnetron’s anode current, keeping its natural frequency locked to the reference. We next investigate the injection locking of the frequency locked magnetron with small injection levels (- 29 dBc to - 43 dBc) under differing operating conditions and observe a phase jitter performance of the order of+/- 13 o for very small <b>heater</b> <b>power</b> and - 29 dBc injection level. We then fast switch/ramp the injection phase and establish the maximum rate of change of the magnetron output phase. This rate was found to be 4 p/us for - 29 dBc injection level and 44 W <b>heater</b> <b>power.</b> We finally discuss the implementation of a fast DSP based feedback control on the injection phase to improve the magnetron phase jitter performance to below 1 o r. m. s...|$|R
