25|$|Excess <b>preformed</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> {{during early}} {{pregnancy}} {{has also been}} associated with {{a significant increase in}} birth defects. These defects may be severe, even life-threatening. Even twice the daily recommended amount can cause severe birth defects. The FDA currently recommends that pregnant women get their vitamin A from foods containing β-carotene and that they should ensure that they consume no more than 5,000 IU of <b>preformed</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> (if any) per day. Although vitamin A is necessary for fetal development, most women carry stores of vitamin A in their fat cells, so over-supplementation should be strictly avoided.|$|E

25|$|Vitamin A {{deficiency}} {{can occur}} {{as either a}} primary or a secondary deficiency. A primary vitamin A deficiency occurs among children and adults who do not consume an adequate intake of provitamin A carotenoids from fruits and vegetables or <b>preformed</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> from animal and dairy products.

2500|$|Since <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> is fat-soluble, {{disposing}} of any excesses taken in through diet takes {{much longer than}} with water-soluble B vitamins and vitamin C. [...] This allows for toxic levels of <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> to accumulate. These toxicities only occur with <b>preformed</b> (retinoid) <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> (such as from liver). The carotenoid forms (such as beta-carotene as found in carrots), give no such symptoms, but excessive dietary intake of beta-carotene can lead to carotenodermia, a harmless but cosmetically displeasing orange-yellow discoloration of the skin.|$|R
50|$|Pregnant {{women are}} advised to pay {{attention}} to the foods they eat during pregnancy, such as soft cheese and certain fish, in order to reduce the risk of exposure to substances or bacteria that may be harmful to the developing fetus. This can include food pathogens and toxic food components, alcohol, and dietary supplements such as <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> and potentially harmful pathogens such as listeria, toxoplasmosis, and salmonella. Dietary <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> is obtained in two forms which contain the <b>preformed</b> <b>vitamin</b> (retinol), that can be found in some animal products such as liver and fish liver oils, and as <b>a</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> precursor in the form of carotene, which can be found in many fruits and vegetables. Intake of large amounts or, conversely, a deficiency, of retinol has been linked to birth defects and abnormalities. It is noted that a 100 g serving of liver may contain a large amount of retinol, so it is best that it is not eaten daily during pregnancy. Excessive amounts of alcohol have been proven to cause fetal alcohol syndrome. The World Health Organization recommends that alcohol should be avoided entirely during pregnancy, given the relatively unknown effects of even small amounts of alcohol during pregnancy. Although seafood contains high levels of Omega-3 fatty acids which are beneficial for both mother and the baby, but there is no consensus on consuming seafood during pregnancy. Pregnant women {{are advised to}} eat seafood in moderation.|$|R
40|$|<b>Vitamin</b> <b>A</b> {{nutrition}} {{status was}} evaluated in 110 pairs {{of women and}} their preschool children at rural health posts in two different ecological regions of Northeast Brazil. Serum retinol and carotene, weight, height, tricep skinfold and mid-arm circumference were measured from each mother and child. Nutrition knowledge of mothers, socioeconomic living conditions and consumption of retinol and carotene food sources were assessed. Nine children (8 percent) and one mother had less than acceptable serum retinol (less than 20 μg/dl). Additionally, 21 {{percent of the children}} and six percent of the mothers had 2 ̆ 2 low 2 ̆ 2 serum carotene levels. Thirty-seven percent and 57 percent of the children were at or below the tenth percentile for height and weight, respectively, when compared to Brazilian standard tables, and 30 percent were below the tenth percentile of weight for height. When compared to NCHS standard tables, 34 percent were below the tenth percentile for weight/height. Nutrition knowledge was very limited, but opportunities for nutrition education are great as mothers wanted more nutrition and feeding information.

40|$|<b>VITAMIN</b> <b>A</b> DEFICIENCY AND ITS RELATED FACTORS IN INFANTS IN BOGOR DISTRICT. Background: Based on {{clinical}} indicators, <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> deficiency in Indonesia {{is not a}} public health problem because the prevalence of xerophthalmia has been decreased to 0. 34 %. But, this decrease has not been followed by a decrease of marginal deficiency of <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> in vulnerable groups, especially infants. Methods: The cross-sectional baseline study was conducted at Bogor District. The aim {{of the study was}} to collect information about the <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> status of the breastfed infant, and to look for a relationship between many factors related to it. The samples were 183 breastfed infants aged 2 - 0 months without chronic disease, congenital disease, severe PEM nor twins. The chi-square and the prevalence odds ratio (POR) at the 95 % confidence interval were used to measure the association between variables. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to measure the closest factors to infant's <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> status. Results: The study showed that 54. 1 % of breastfed infants were at risk of <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> deficiency. Based on bivariate analysis, there are two significant independent variables related to infants <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> status, which are maternal <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> status and infant infection status. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that infection status is the closest factor to <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> deficiency in infants, followed by maternal <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> status and breast feeding frequency. There are no significant association between supplementary feeding, age, nutritional status and the infant's <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> status.

40|$|<b>Vitamin</b> <b>A</b> {{deficiency}} is {{the leading}} cause of blindness(1) and a major cause of severe morbidity and mortality among young children throughout the world(2). <b>Vitamin</b> <b>A</b> deficiency is considered a public health problem in India. However, the prevalence of <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> deficiency has declined from 2 % in 1975 - 79 to 0. 7 % in 1988 - 90 (3). A recent meta analysis of eight controlled trials estimates that community wide <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> supple-mentation can result in a 23 % average reduc-tion in child mortality rates(4). Accordingly, signatory nations of 1992 World Declaration and Plan of Action for Nutrition have pledged to eliminate <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> deficiency by the year 2000 (5). Routine <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> supplementation in under-five children has been recommended to improve child survival(6). The World Health Organization/United Nations Children Fund/International <b>Vitamin</b> <b>A</b> Consultative Group (IVACG) Task Force recommends universal distribution of <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> in countries where xerophthalmia is a public health problem(7). It is recommended to orally supplement 100, 000 IU of <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> to infants and 200, 000 IU of <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> to children between 1 to 6 years of age every 6 months. The Government of India also recommends uni-versal supplementation of 100, 000 IU to all children along with measles vaccine(8).

40|$|Aims: To {{investigate}} {{the prevalence of}} <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> deficiency among lactating women in a poor urban population of Bangladesh, and {{to examine the relationship}} between various factors and <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> status. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Maternal and child health clinic in Dhaka City, Bangladesh. Subjects and methods: A total of 120 lactating women aged 17 - 37 years were randomly selected from women who attended a local maternal and child health clinic in Dhaka City for immunisation of their children. Various socio-economic, personal characteristics, dietary intakes of <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> and anthropometric data were collected. Serum retinol (<b>vitamin</b> <b>A)</b> concentration was determined as <b>a</b> measure of <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> status. Results: Of the subjects, 37 % had low serum <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> levels (< 30 μg dl(- 1)), with 13. 3 % having sub-clinical <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> deficiency (< 20 mug dl(- 1)). Eighty-seven per cent had <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> intakes below the recommended dietary allowance. The lactating women who were either illiterate or received only informal education had significantly (P= 0. 002) lower serum <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> levels compared with those who received formal education. The women whose husbands received formal education had significantly (P= 0. 05) higher serum <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> levels than those whose husbands were either illiterate or received only informal education. The serum <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> levels of women in households with poor sanitation/latrine practice were significantly (P= 0. 03) lower than those of women in households with good sanitation/latrine practice. The women with one child had significantly (P= 0. 015) lower serum <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> levels than those with two or more children. Women with a lactation period of 6 months or more had significantly (P= 0. 034) lower serum <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> levels than women with a lactation period of less than 6 months. The women who consumed less than the median <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> intake (274. 8 mug day(- 1)) had significantly (P= 0. 01) lower serum <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> levels than those who consumed more than the median <b>vitamin</b> <b>A</b> intake.
