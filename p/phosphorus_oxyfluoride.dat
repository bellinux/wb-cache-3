5000|$|... {{hydrolysis}} yields , {{a strong}} Lewis acid that reacts with electron-rich species, such as water. [...] reacts {{with water to}} form hydrofluoric acid (HF) and <b>phosphorus</b> <b>oxyfluoride.</b> <b>Phosphorus</b> <b>oxyfluoride</b> in turn reacts to form additional HF and difluorohydroxy phosphoric acid. HF converts the rigid SEI film into a fragile one. On the cathode, the carbonate solvent can then diffuse onto the cathode oxide over time, releasing heat and thermal runaway.|$|E

40|$|The thermal {{decomposition}} of LiPF 6 in solution with carbonate solvents has been investigated. The thermal dissociation of LiPF 6 into LiF and PF 5 is known. In solution, PF 5 reacts with carbonates {{to form a}} variety of decomposition products including: carbon dioxide (CO 2), ethers (R 2 O), alkylfluorides (RF), <b>phosphorus</b> <b>oxyfluoride</b> (OPF 3), and fluorophosphates (OPF 2 OR, OPF(OR) 2), assignment of structure is supported by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and Gas Chromatography with Mass Selective Detection (GC-MS). Similar decomposition products are observed during the {{thermal decomposition}} of carbonate solutions of LiPF 6. Since solutions of LiPF 6 are widely used as Li-ion battery electrolytes, there is interest among battery manufacturers and researchers as to the thermal decomposition of this electrolyte. Here we describe the structural and mechanistic investigations of the thermal decomposition of lithium-ion battery electrolytes. The electrolyte undergoes autocatalytic decomposition reactions at moderately elevated temperatures (80 – 100 °C) to produce {{a large number of}} decomposition products. Results indicate that the thermal decomposition reactions are suppressed by the electrode, particularly the cathode, or intended stabilizing additives. ...|$|E
