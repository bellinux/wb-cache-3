5|$|On {{the east}} end of the roof, the church had a cupola which was topped with a large {{concrete}} <b>pineapple.</b> Pineapples were a feature of several buildings in Southampton as a symbol of welcome, an idea that originated in the Caribbean and which possibly reached the city {{as a result of the}} slave trade in the 16th century. The <b>pineapple</b> survived the bombing and has been used as an exhibited on special occasions, such as Black History Month.|$|E
5|$|Apart from notable {{passengers}} carried during her tenure, City of Honolulu also frequently {{served as a}} conveyance for newlyweds heading for Hawaiian honeymoons. She also carried, in addition to passengers, cargo in both directions, transporting commodities, such as fertilizer and oil, to Hawaii, and Hawaiian goods, like sugar and fresh and canned <b>pineapple</b> to the mainland.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pineapples</b> {{became a}} major crop in the {{district}} and the main freight carried. In 1953 a cannery opened at Koongal, Rockhampton, to which <b>pineapples</b> were railed. When it closed <b>pineapples</b> were railed to the cannery at Northgate in wagons adapted for bulk transport.|$|R
30|$|<b>Pineapples</b> {{from the}} Dominican Republic were treated by {{immersion}} with thiabendazole to avoid mould growth. This treatment was apparently performed inadvertently {{because it is}} normally reserved for <b>pineapples</b> that are shipped by sea. Since these <b>pineapples</b> were shipped by air, however, the shipping time was inadequate for degradation of the fungicidal agent.|$|R
50|$|The {{company has}} ceased {{planting}} <b>pineapples</b> on Hawaii. Once the currently planted crops are harvested, {{there will be}} no more commercial cultivation of <b>pineapples</b> after a century on the Islands.|$|R
5|$|In the Andes {{region of}} South America, with civilizations {{including}} the Inca, the major crop was the potato, domesticated approximately 7,000–10,000 years ago. Coca, still a major crop to this day, was domesticated in the Andes, {{as were the}} peanut, tomato, tobacco, and <b>pineapple.</b> Cotton was domesticated in Peru by 3,600 BC. Animals were also domesticated, including llamas, alpacas, and guinea pigs.|$|E
5|$|In the Bahamas, {{insurers}} and reinsurers estimated industry insured losses at about $300million (2004 dollars). All cool-season vegetable plantings, {{and the entire}} banana crop, were lost during Frances. The <b>pineapple</b> crop was significantly impacted by wind damage in Eleuthera, while the entire fruit crop was lost for similar reasons. The corn crop in Long Island and Cat Island was completely lost. Significant poultry losses were experienced.|$|E

5|$|Pottery {{and weaving}} {{are among the}} very first art forms {{showcasing}} Filipino artistic design and are evident from cave dwellings all over the country. Among these are mostly anthropomorphic earthenware jars dating from c. 5BC to 225AD. Weaving was mostly done by women, using fibers from abaca, <b>pineapple,</b> cotton, and bark to make clothes, rugs and hats. Baskets were mostly utilized to carry grain and other foods.|$|E
5|$|When Iowan began sailing for American-Hawaiian, {{the company}} shipped cargo from East Coast ports via the Straits of Magellan to West Coast ports and Hawaii, and vice versa. Eastbound {{shipments}} were primarily sugar and <b>pineapple</b> from Hawaii, while westbound cargoes were more general in nature. With {{the opening of}} the Panama Canal on 15 August 1914, American-Hawaiian ships switched to taking that route.|$|E
50|$|Timber, {{sugar and}} <b>pineapples</b> are intensively {{grown in the}} area, which {{produces}} over 90% of South Africa's queen <b>pineapples.</b> Other agricultural crops are sugar-cane, sisal, cotton, tomatoes and chillies.

50|$|In 1895, Thomas Bartholomew built a sawmill {{near the}} railway yards and it {{operated}} until 1965. Equally important, in 1895, Thomas Davey grew the first <b>pineapples</b> commercially in Woombye. Other growers quickly followed him and by 1903, there were 120 acre of <b>pineapples</b> in the district.|$|R
5|$|Anomalocaridids, such as Anomalocaris, were {{organism}}s {{thought to}} be distantly related to the arthropods. These creatures looked quite unlike any organism living today—they had segmented exoskeletons, with lateral lobes used for swimming, typically large compound eyes, often set on stalks, and most strikingly, a pair of large, claw-like great appendages that resembled headless shrimp. These appendages {{are thought to have}} passed food to the animal's mouth, which resembled a ring of sliced <b>pineapple.</b>|$|E
5|$|Davis {{started a}} <b>pineapple</b> {{plantation}} on Key Biscayne; six acres (two-and-a-half hectares) {{had been cleared}} and planted in pineapples in 1893–94. Davis also directed his caretaker to plant one-half to one acre (two-tenths to four-tenths of a hectare) of bananas. By 1898, {{a great variety of}} tropical fruit trees had been planted on the island. Davis also had a large dwelling built for his use. It was a two-story cottage with five bedrooms and verandas on three sides, raised ten feet above the ground on pilings to protect against storm surges.|$|E
5|$|In May 1905, {{after two}} years of negotiations, American-Hawaiian signed a {{contract}} with the Tehuantepec National Railway of Mexico, abandoning the Straits of Magellan route in favor of the Tehuantepec Route. Shipments on the Tehuantepec Route would arrive at Mexican ports—Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, for eastbound cargo, and Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, for westbound cargo—and would traverse the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Mexico's narrowest point, on the railroad. Eastbound shipments were primarily sugar and <b>pineapple</b> from Hawaii, while westbound cargoes were more general in nature.|$|E

5|$|A pisco sour is an {{alcoholic}} cocktail of Peruvian origin that {{is typical of}} the cuisines from Chile and Peru, considered also a South American classic. The drink's name comes from pisco, which is its base liquor, and the cocktail term sour, in reference to sour citrus juice and sweetener components. The Peruvian pisco sour uses Peruvian pisco as the base liquor and adds freshly squeezed lime juice, syrup, ice, egg white, and Angostura bitters. The Chilean version is similar, but uses Chilean pisco and pica lime, and excludes the bitters and egg white. Other variants of the cocktail include those created with fruits like <b>pineapple</b> or plants such as coca leaves.|$|E
50|$|In 1916 unused Crown Land near Beerburrum's railway siding was {{surveyed}} into portions for returned {{soldiers to}} grow <b>pineapples.</b> Some land at Woombye and Palmwoods was also resumed under the Soldier Settlement scheme. Beerburrum Soldier Settlement {{was the largest}} soldier settlement area in Australia by 1921, but it had failed by 1932, and helped to produce a glut of <b>pineapples</b> in the process. Queensland production of <b>pineapples</b> doubled between 1932 and 1942, and doubled again between 1952 and 1956, {{to a total of}} 12,316 acres by the latter date.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} UV-C {{radiation}} on keeping {{the quality of}} fresh-cut <b>pineapples</b> (Ananas comosus L. Merr. cv. Comte de Paris) were investigated. The fresh-cut <b>pineapples</b> were treated with UV-C radiation for 60 s and 90 s respectively. And the slices were placed in plastic trays, sealed with polymeric films and stored at 10 °C. Their firmness, browning, reducing sugar, titratable acidity, TSS and vitamin C were determined. UV-C radiation significantly inhibited the decrease in the firmness, TSS and sugar reduction and the increasing rate of titratable acidity in the fresh-cut <b>pineapples.</b> And at the same time, no statistically differences were noted when the slices treated for 60 s and 90 s exposure time were compared (p< 0. 05). However, UV-C radiation tremendously decreased the content of vitamin C in the fresh-cut <b>pineapples.</b> Likewise, {{no significant differences were}} noted when the slices treated for 60 s and 90 s were compared (p< 0. 05). Meanwhile, UV-C radiation induced browning throughout the storage period, and the extension of exposure time resulted in increase in the browning in the fresh-cut <b>pineapples...</b>|$|R

5|$|After {{playing one}} of the titular roles in the romantic drama Tristan & Isolde (2006), Franco starred in the Tony Bill-directed war drama Flyboys (2006). Two years later, he played against type in the action-comedy film <b>Pineapple</b> Express, and earned {{critical}} acclaim for portraying Scott Smith in the biographical film Milk alongside Sean Penn. For the former, he {{was nominated for a}} Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Comedy. Franco portrayed the trapped canyoneer Aron Ralston in 127 Hours (2010), a survival drama, which earned him an Academy Award for Best Actor nomination. Franco appeared in four films in 2011, including the poorly-received fantasy film Your Highness, and the science fiction film Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011), a critical and commercial success.|$|E
5|$|As {{the bird}} became extinct before {{significant}} field observations could be made, not much {{is known about}} its behavior. The Lānai hookbill is only known to have eaten {{the fruit of the}} ōpuhe; however, it is unlikely that its unique bill would have developed to eat fruit, and {{it may have been a}} snail specialist. The hookbill has not been seen since 1918, and by 1940 nearly all of Lānai's forests were converted into <b>pineapple</b> fields, destroying the bird’s habitat. The combination of habitat destruction and the introduction of feral cats and rats are thought to have led to the Lānai hookbill’s extinction.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} make the show seem more realistic, Franks and other writers talked to his father, a former Los Angeles police officer, and several psychics. Much of the episode's content was improvised by the actors, and Roday {{included}} a <b>pineapple</b> in the episode, continuing the reoccurring theme on the show. James Roday talked to producers about including singing in the series' second episode, but the idea was shut down because it was too soon in the show. In addition, Steve Franks considered writing one of the show's early episodes to be about a psychic claiming Shawn was a fraud, but delayed writing the episode until later. The producers attempted to include themes against smoking and the issues of friendship. Franks also included a character named Mrs. Foote, a reference to his 1999 movie Big Daddy.|$|E
