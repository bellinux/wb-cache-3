40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a method of converting drill cuttings from gas shale wells into high strength proppants via flame spheroidization and devitrification <b>processing.</b> <b>Conversion</b> of drill cuttings to spherical particles was only possible for small particle sizes (< 53 {micro}m) using a flame former after a homogenizing melting step. This size limitation is likely to be impractical for application as conventional proppants due to particle packing characteristics. In an attempt to overcome the particle size limitation, sodium and calcium were added to the drill cuttings to act as fluxes during the spheroidization process. However, the flame former remained unable to form spheres from the fluxed material at the relatively large diameters (0. 5 - 2 mm) targeted for proppants. For future work, the flame former could be modified to operate at higher temperature or longer residence time in order to produce larger, spherical materials. Post spheroidization heat treatments should be investigated to tailor the final phase assemblage for high strength and sufficient chemical durability...|$|E

Also discussed are the influence of HTC heating methods and temperature on HBW <b>processing</b> <b>conversion</b> into solid fuel char, i. e. yield and post-HTC management, i. e. dewaterability rates, particle size distribution and the carbon and energy properties of solid fuel char.

The microwave process {{was found to be}} more efficient for dewatering processed HBW and for char recovery, consuming half the energy used by the conventional HTC method despite the similarity in yields, carbon and energy properties of the recovered char. However, both processes reliably overcame the heterogeneity of HBW, converting them into non-foul end products, which were easily dewatered at < 3 seconds/g total solids (TS) (c. f. 50. 3 seconds/g TS for a raw sample) to recover energy-densified chars of ≈ 17 MJ/kg calorific value and up to 1. 4 g/l of ammonia concentration in recovered liquor...|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] Power {{generation}} can be advantageously done using Solid Oxide Fuel Cells {{that are}} capable of operating with CO, light Hydrocarbons and even some H 2 S. The SOFC operating at high temperatures allow also a heat recycling for the fuel <b>processing.</b> <b>Conversion</b> of liquid fuels into gaseous reformate for SOFC feeding is however quite difficult. The high Sulphur and aromatic content of fuels deactivate classical catalytic processors or create a significant soot problem. We avoid these problems using our High-Voltage discharge (called GlidArc) for the cold-start of such plasma processors. Then the discharge assists the Partial Oxidation of various fuels with atmospheric air. Such assistance concerns the feed pre-reforming in the plasma zone as well as the process achievement in the post-plasma zone packed with activated refractory granules. Such an electrically assisted process accepts almost any feed at up to 4 % of Sulphur content. The feed conversion is total and the process is very simple. No soot, coke or tars are produced even from such fuels as fossil Diesel oil, JP- 8 military aviation fuel, Rapeseed oil or Soybean biodiesel. Atmospheric pressure reforming is proposed but higher pressures can also be applied. The output reformate gas reaches presently 75 kW (accounted as the LHV power). Roughly 1 % of assistant electric power is necessary to drive our processors. Up to 46 vol. % of H 2 + CO mixture is produced (the balance being mostly the N 2) in long runs. An 82 % thermal efficiency of the process is obtained and a large part of remaining heat can be further reused...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{increases}} in cereals prices {{raise questions about}} agricultural priorities in Ghana. This report presents an application of the Policy Analysis Matrix (PAM) {{to the problem of}} identifying opportunities to enhance agriculture’s contribution to economic growth and poverty alleviation in the country. The PAM is a budget-based method that was applied to study the social and private profitability of six maize production systems and six rice production systems. The results indicate that all twelve of the systems contribute to national economic growth and private income generation among farmers, at least under the high cereals prices that prevailed in 2007. Maize systems show a higher rate of return (lower cost/benefit ratio) than rice systems. If prices returned to lower levels experienced in 2005, however, rice systems would be privately and socially unprofitable. Return to the still lower prices of 2002 would leave both the maize and rice systems unprofitable. The PAM was also used {{to assess the impact of}} alternative interventions for increasing profitability in the face of lower output prices. The results suggest that higher adoption of input technologies could make maize profitable under a very wide range of prices. However, fertilizer prices are not likely to be the constraining factor input adoption as the price of fertilizer has little impact on farm profitability given current levels of fertilizer use. Rather, further research is needed to determine how to promote improved maize production technology. For rice systems there appears to be room to enhance profitability through post-farm interventions to reduce processing losses and to improve the quality of locally grown rice. Rice systems would be profitable under very low output prices if Ghana achieved the <b>processing</b> <b>conversion</b> rates and milled rice quality found in other countries.

40|$|This paper pursues {{the goal}} of further {{developing}} a testing procedure which precisely and reliably records the knowledge in the inductive conclusion allowing for a differentiated statement about the individual extent of knowledge {{as well as a}} prognosis about the future success of training. The START-W knowledge test is a component of the comprehensive START battery of tests which reproduces the individual basic competences at the commencement of work and is oriented on DIN Norm 33430. The importance of knowledge in the occupational context results from the key competence research and the insight that knowledge is seen as a basic prerequisite for the “conscious <b>processing,</b> <b>conversion,</b> assessment and linking of information to something new, to ideas, actions, to products and services” (Blümelhuber, 2005, pg. 145, Übers. durch den Autor). On the basis of the economic, technological and social changes the importance of development and diagnostic recording of key competences are emphasized by various national and international institutions. Here, intelligence and knowledge are considered to be relevant skills for handling the new type of (professional) problems, thinking in an interdisciplinary manner, acting in a targeted manner and determining connections (e. g. Schuler & Höft, 2006). A systematization of the connection between intelligence and knowledge or more fluid and crystallized intelligence is represented by the investment theory from Cattell (1971 a, 1987). The structural theory forms the basis for the following research approaches. The basis for the intended validation study is formed by a random sample of 753 volunteers in the age of 16 - 46 (average age 20. 74), who had a clear relationship to the target population for potential entry level employees. The items and scales are exploratory analyzed. This results in satisfactory values which correspond to the criteria of the test construction. Subsequent reliability estimates support the findings that the knowledge can be reliably measured. The examination of the convergent validity with the “Bochum Knowledge Test” (Hossiep & Schulte, 2008) shows that both procedures present convergent constructs and record the acquired knowledge or the crystallized intelligence. In the framework of the construct validity and on the basis of confirmatory factor analyses it was also possible to make a differentiated reproduction of the intended structure. The structure equation model clearly demonstrates that both the intended subject areas, the verbal, numerical and figural coded scales of content and the factor “crystallized intelligence” (gc) can be extracted. The concordance validity (school grades of the final report card) and the prognostic validity (average grade of the first –probationary- semester in schools for health professionals) as partial aspects of the criterion validity can be described as satisfactory. With regard to the practical applicability of the testing procedure, the prognostic validity is especially relevant, because the findings allow an inference to be made about the success of training at schools for health professionals. At a higher level the question about the interaction facets of fluid and crystallized intelligence is investigated. In general terms, the influence of the aptitude and the environment on the accumulation of knowledge is analyzed as in the investment theory (Cattell, 1971 a, 1987), possible explanatory methods discussed and therefore application-based, diagnostic implications proposed. In this context the differences in knowledge depending on age, native tongue, gender and the level of education are observed. With regard to the connection between fluid intelligence (gf) and crystallized intelligence (gc), {{it can be seen that}} gc` (nested factor) at a lower level of generality (the knowledge-topical variances are more relevant) correlates to a lesser extent with fluid intelligence (gf). By contrast the more readily generalized, content-related knowledge variances (gc) correlate to a greater extent with the fluid intelligence (gc). With regard to the practically oriented application, it can be seen that the simulated recording of fluid and crystallized intelligence plays an important role in occupational profiles which require a broad-based knowledge. By means of uni- and multivariate analytic methods it was also possible to investigate environmentally-related factors on the development of knowledge. It can be seen that, above all, the level of education represents an important determinant for the differences in knowledge. The START-W therefore represents an indicator for the general education and it offers a suitable differentiation for purposes of diagnostic decisions regarding aptitude. At the same time, an additional indicator of the validity of the testing procedure is provided. In view of the differences in knowledge determined between volunteers with German as their native language and volunteers whose native tongue was foreign, there are, above all, opportunities for application in the field of pedagogy. The separately determined findings that in both cases slight differences are shown in the fluid intelligence indicate that differential psychological aspects are very important in practice. This leads to the conclusion that the performance of entry-level employees is determined on the basis of a multitude of factors. Aptitude-diagnostic interpretations and decisions must therefore be made in the context of the varying influencing factors. The results allow for at least three fields of application for the START-W and the I-S-T 2000 R (Liepmann et al., 2007). These are the (a) business-psychological (e. g. vocational guidance, applicant selection), (b) pedagogical (e. g. test for school or university qualification, evaluation of teaching concepts, recording of sub-group specific differences in abilities, initiation of supporting development) and (c) clinical field. The findings underline the assumption that an integration of knowledge tests and intelligence structure tests represent a new insight for the determination of occupational competence. The sue of psychological testing procedures is relatively low for schools in the health industry, although a great need for qualified caregivers is to be expected in view of the demographic change. The START-W differentiates between various educational groups, allows an estimation of the future success of schooling or training and guarantees, in combination with the START test battery detailed statements about the profile. In the final analysis the focus is on the development of the capability profile, which records both the status as well as the potential knowledge of entry-level employees so as to bring the individual abilities into harmony with the educational and occupational requirements...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Strategies for {{environmental}} sustainability and global food security must account for dietary change. Using a biophysical simulation model we calculated human carrying capacity under ten diet scenarios. The scenarios included two reference diets based on actual consumption and eight “Healthy Diet” scenarios that complied with nutritional recommendations but varied {{in the level}} of meat content. We considered the U. S. agricultural land base and accounted for losses, <b>processing</b> <b>conversions,</b> livestock feed needs, suitability of land for crops or grazing, and land productivity. Annual per capita land requirements ranged from 0. 13 to 1. 08 ha person- 1 year- 1 across the ten diet scenarios. Carrying capacity varied from 402 to 807 million persons; 1. 3 to 2. 6 times the 2010 U. S. population. Carrying capacity was generally higher for scenarios with less meat and highest for the lacto-vegetarian diet. However, the carrying capacity of the vegan diet was lower than two of the healthy omnivore diet scenarios. Sensitivity analysis showed that carrying capacity estimates were highly influenced by starting assumptions about the proportion of cropland available for cultivated cropping. Population level dietary change can contribute substantially to meeting future food needs, though ongoing agricultural research and sustainable management practices are still needed to assure sufficient production levels...|$|R
