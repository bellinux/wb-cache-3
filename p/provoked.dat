40|$|Little {{attention}} has been paid to the situations which <b>provoke</b> the initial attack of anxiety in agoraphobia. According to the behaviour completion hypothesis many normal subjects experience increased tension in such situations when there is a delay in the completion of a behaviour. One hundred and eight medical students completed a questionnaire designed to investigate this hypothesis. They reported experiencing increased tension or anxiety significantly more frequently in situations <b>provoking</b> agoraphobia when the situations contained a component of delay, as compared to such situations without this component, or to situations not commonly <b>provoking</b> agoraphobia. It is proposed that tension, anxiety and panic form a continuum of increasing levels of arousal, but are associated with different cognitions. It is further proposed that the arousal level of agoraphobics is sensitized, so that delay which <b>provokes</b> mild increases of arousal in the healthy, <b>provokes</b> high arousal in agoraphobics. This finding supports the hypothesis that delay in behaviour completion is a mechanism in the generation of tension and anxiety...|$|R

Patients for whom an exogenous <b>provoking</b> factor was recorded were sent a questionnaire. Subsequently, patients who mentioned a chemical <b>provoking</b> factor were contacted to elucidate the alleged causal relationship between exposure to the chemical and the onset of vitiligo. A total of 300 out of the 1264 patients indicated that <b>provoking</b> factors had played a role in their disease. Two hundred and forty-six patients were sent a questionnaire, which was returned by 177 (response rate of 72 %).
