40|$|Coordinated {{partitioning}} of intracellular cargoes between {{nuclear and}} cytoplasmic compartments {{is critical for}} cell survival and differentiation. The karyopherin α/β heterodimer functions to import cytoplasmic proteins that possess classical nuclear localization signals into the nucleus. Seven karyopherin α subtypes {{have been identified in}} mammals. The aim of these studies were to determine the roles karypopherin alpha 7 (KPNA 7) served during early <b>porcine</b> <b>embryo</b> development. Quantitative RT-PCR results revealed that the seven KPNA subtypes have various transcript abundance at discrete stages of <b>porcine</b> <b>embryo</b> development. KPNA 7 has the highest level of transcripts in early porcine cleavage stage embryos and the expression reduce significantly by the blastocyst stage. Immunocytochemical analysis showed that KPNA 7 adopted nuclear localization in GV-stage oocytes, 2 -cell and 4 -cell stage embryos, but not in blastocyst stage embryos. The targeted reduction of KPNA 7 led to reduced developmental competence in porcine embryos. An in vitro binding assay revealed that KPNA 7 could bind to karyopherin β and suppressor of variation 39 homolog 2 (SUV 39 h 2). A GST pull-down assay was performed in order to screen for KPNA 7 -specific cargo proteins. Here a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) approach was used to determine the proteins that interact with recombinant KPNA 7, twenty-two proteins were presumed to be the cargoes for KPNA 7, and DAVID analysis predicted that these proteins were related to critical events such as transcription, histone modification, chromatin organization and DNA binding. Together, our data suggest that KPNA 7 serves a critical role in early <b>porcine</b> <b>embryo</b> development. ...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1982 The mechanism(s) {{involved}} with intrauterine migration of the <b>porcine</b> <b>embryo</b> was investigated. Twenty-four gilts on Days 6, 9 and 12 of gestation (Day 0 = 1 st day of estrus) were utilized {{to examine the}} relationship between myometrial activity and intrauterine migration. On Day 2, embryos were flushed from one oviduct and transferred to the opposite oviduct. Myometrial contractility increased concomitant with embryo migration through the uterus (day x side interaction, P<. 10). Uterine flushings contained a short-acting component that mimicked, in part, the stimulatory influence(s) of the <b>porcine</b> <b>embryo</b> on myometrial activity. Furthermore, only flushings from the uterine segment containing the Day 12 embryos could overcome the inhibitory effects of indomethacin (P<. 01) on myometrial activity. The <b>porcine</b> <b>embryo</b> coincubated with myometrial strips could not directly stimulate myometrial activity. The role of estradio 1 - 17 β (E₂) and histamine in migration of the <b>porcine</b> <b>embryo</b> was examined. The involvement of E₂ in embryo migration was examined by observing the distribution of silastic beads impregnated with cholesterol (five gilts) or E₂ (five gilts) on Day 12 of the estrous cycle (after 5 days in utero). Beads impregnated with E₂ migrated further (P<. 05) than those impregnated with cholesterol. Twenty additional gilts and sows were assigned to four groups (n = 5) and were used to determine if histamine was {{involved with}} intrauterine migration. Cromolyn sodium (an inhibitor of histamine release) treatment when administered on Day 6 restricted (P<. 05) Day 10 embryos to the tip of the uterine horn but Day 12 embryos had gained the ability to overcome this restriction. Injection of histamine concomitantly with cromolyn sodium restored migration of Day 10 embryos. Day 5 and 7 porcine embryos recovered from 24 donors were compared for migration and survival ability in 16 nonpregnant Day 6 recipients. The percentage of Day 5 and 7 embryos surviving the transfer procedures (Day 11) did not differ. However, by midgestation (Day 60) more Day 7 (P<. 001) than Day 5 embryos had survived. Migration of the embryos may be of importance because the distance between adjacent fetuses was significantly correlated with fetal weight (r =. 47, P<. 01) ...|$|E
40|$|Successful {{cleavage}} {{development of}} mammalian embryos requires precise activation and repression of transcription. Gene expression is regulated through epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and histone modifications. Because {{there is a}} global remodeling of epigenetic modifications in the early developing embryo, we want to gain insight {{into the role of}} these epigenetic modifiers, as it will provide information on how developmentally important genes are regulated. The early developing embryo has a window where it is sensitive to in vitro manipulation, thus resulting in compromised development. Therefore, it is essential to understand mechanisms involved in epigenetic remodeling during cleavage development in hopes of improving methods that utilize in vitro manipulations, such as in vitro fertilization, embryo culture, somatic cell nuclear transfer, and stem cell therapy. ^ The first goal of my {{study was to determine the}} localization of the histone methyltransferases Suv 39 H 2, G 9 a, and ESET in the porcine oocyte and cleavage stage <b>porcine</b> <b>embryo.</b> The localization of these proteins would provide insight into the role of these enzymes in the methylation of lysine 9 of histone H 3, a modification that results in gene silencing. It appears that Suv 39 H 2, G 9 a, and ESET all play an important role in the methylation of H 3 /K 9 as they are all present in the nucleus, although ESET was also in the cytoplasm, which may suggest its lesser role during this developmental time period. ^ The second objective was to determine the developmental requirement for the histone methyltransferase G 9 a by performing knockdown experiments to lower G 9 a transcript abundance in the oocyte and cleavage stage <b>porcine</b> <b>embryo.</b> Although our RNAi oligonucleotides were effective at reducing G 9 a transcript abundance, no significant effect on embryo development was detectable. ^ Overall these results indicate that each histone methyltransferase plays a distinct role at critical time points during <b>porcine</b> <b>embryo</b> development. ...|$|E

However, the blastocyst rates from the cryopreserved groups were significantly lower than the noncryopreserved controls (p 0. 05).

Methods <b>Porcine</b> <b>embryos</b> were produced by SCNT and cultured in {{the presence or absence of}} ascorbic acid. Ten-eleven translocation 3 (TET 3) in oocytes was knocked down by siRNA injection. After ascorbic acid treatment, reprogramming genes were analyzed by realtime reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Furthermore, relative 5 -methylcytosine and 5 -hydroxymethylcytosine content in pronucleus were detected by realtime PCR. Results Ascorbic acid significantly increased the development of <b>porcine</b> <b>embryos</b> produced by SCNT. After SCNT, transcript levels of reprogramming genes, Pou 5 f 1, Sox 2, and Klf were significantly increased in blastocysts. Furthermore, ascorbic acid reduced 5 -methylcytosine content in pronuclear embryos compared with the control group. Knock down of TET 3 in porcine oocytes significantly prevents the demethylation of somatic cell nucleus after SCNT, even if in the presence of ascorbic acid.

We investigated the effect of ginsenoside Rg 1 on the in vitro development of preimplantation porcine embryos after parthenogenetic activation in high-oxygen conditions. Ginsenoside treatment did not affect cleavage or blastocyst formation rates, but did increase the total cell number and reduced the rate of apoptosis.

The present study investigated chromatin and nucleolar dynamics in <b>porcine</b> <b>embryos</b> developed in vivo (IV) and compared this physiological standard to that of embryos produced by IVF, parthenogenetic activation (PA), or SCNT. In contrast to IV embryos, chromatin spatial and temporal dynamics in PA, IVF, and SCNT embryos were altered; starting with aberrant chromatin–nuclear envelope interactions at the two-cell stage, delayed chromatin decondensation and nucleolar development at the four-cell stage, and ultimately culminating in failure of proper first lineage segregation at the blastocyst stage, demonstrated by poorly defined inner cell mass. Interestingly, in vitro produced (IVP) embryos also lacked a heterochromatin halo around nucleolar precursors, indicating imperfections in global chromatin remodeling after fertilization/activation.

40|$|The {{establishment}} of in vitro culture models utilizes tissue engineering principles to design functional mimics of in vivo environments in vitro. Advantages {{for the use}} of in vitro culture models include ethical alleviation of animal models for therapeutic testing, cost efficiency, and a greater ability to study specific mechanisms via a systematic, ground-up approach to development. In this thesis, alginate hydrogels are utilized in the development of in vitro culture models of <b>porcine</b> <b>embryo</b> elongation and growth plate cartilage development. First, the effect of scaffold and modifications to the scaffold were explored in both projects. In order to modulate cell-scaffold interactions, the alginate molecule was covalently modified with the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) peptide, which has been extensively used to promote cell adhesion in vitro. In the <b>porcine</b> <b>embryo</b> elongation studies, a previously established culture system was used as a tool to encapsulate embryos and explore the effect of soluble factors on embryo survivability, rate of morphological changes, gene expression and hormone production by using RGD-modified alginate and alginate mixed with osteopontin (SPP 1), a glycoprotein known to be secreted in the uterus. RGD-alginate encapsulation led to significant increases in embryo survivability and morphological changes along with corresponding cellular outputs. In the growth plate cartilage development model, chondrocytes were encapsulated in alginate and RGD-alginate to elucidate effects of cell adhesion, mimicking cell-matrix interactions within the growth plate, on chondrocyte phenotype. Additionally, alginate encapsulation was utilized to culture chondrocytes in media supplemented with parathyroid hormone (PTH) or Indian hedgehog (IHH) to begin to study the mechanisms behind these two molecules on the {{establishment of}} the zonal architecture and column formation that is unique to the growth plate. Cell cycle distribution, gene expression immunofluorescence and fluorescent in situ hybridization techniques together indicated our ability to suppress hypertrophy using alginate hydrogel scaffolds and/or signaling molecules. Overall, utilization of these in vitro culture models as tools to study developmental mechanisms can be used to advance both the fields of porcine embryology and cartilage developmental biology to improve pregnancy outcomes in pigs and to engineer therapies for the treatment of growth plate injuries and diseases.

Boar spermatozoa with or without DTT treatment (5 mM, 30 min) were injected into in vitro matured porcine oocytes, and the nuclear phase in presumptive zygotes was observed at 3 h intervals up to 12 h after ICSI. Furthermore, developmental competence of embryos produced by DTT-treated or non-treated spermatozoa was monitored after cultivation in vitro for 144 h. Male and female pronuclear formation rates in the oocytes injected with DTT-treated spermatozoa were significantly (P < 0. 05) higher than those in the oocytes injected with non-treated spermatozoa. Additionally, we observed that female pronuclear formation was linked to male pronuclear formation. Sperm treatment with DTT improved (P < 0. 05) subsequent development up to the blastocyst stage.

In the 205 IVP embryos investigated, all two-cell embryos (n = 34) were categorized as transcriptionally inactive. At the late four-cell stage (n = 45), 38 % of the embryos contained 1 - 3 nuclei with signs of rRNA transcription, indicating an asynchronous transcription initiation. This pattern continued in the following stages, as 78 % (n = 47), 47 % (n = 42) and 83 % (n = 37) of the embryos revealed a mixture of transcriptionally inactive and active cells at the eight-cell, 16 -cell and blastocyst stage, respectively. In the 143 SCNT embryos investigated, all two-cell embryos (n = 34) and early four-cell embryos (n = 12) were also transcriptionally inactive.

The study revealed that (1) the addition of cysteine during IVM was beneficial to early embryo development; (2) application of gradient Percoll and glutathione during sperm conditioning for IVF also improved the outcome of early embryo development; (3) when two common <b>porcine</b> <b>embryo</b> culture media, NCSU 23 and BECM 3 were tested {{for their ability to}} support porcine zygotes in vitro, the NCSU 23 medium consistently showed an equal or better rate of embryo development; (4) the efficacy of two-step embryo culture using these two media was no better in supporting the development of embryos when compared to the single-step NCSU 23 medium; (5) the developmental competence of the IVM-produced oocyte was maintained for at least 16 h; (6) the oocyte activation by a combination treatment, calcium ionophore followed by 6 -dimethylaminopurine, was the most effective among three common activation protocols evaluated; (7) the developmental competence of porcine oocytes was significantly affected by an interaction among the age of the donor animal, ovarian follicle size, and exogenous gonadotropic stimulation. In conclusion, this study provided a valuable assessment of the factors involved in porcine in vitro oocyte and embryo culture system. ...|$|E
40|$|Gene {{expression}} is precisely regulated during porcine embryogenesis. One way to activate or inactivate gene {{expression is}} to change its epigenetic modifications through chromatin-remodeling complexes, histone demethylase and histone methyltransferases. Another way to regulate gene expression {{is to change}} the expression level of specific Karyopherin α (KPNA). ^ The first aim {{of the study was to}} identify the expression pattern of H 3 K 27 demethylases, JMJD 3 and UTX in GV-stage porcine oocytes, and 4 -cell and blastocyst stage porcine embryos. We found that the expression patterns of JMJD 3 and UTX are not identical, indicating that these proteins may serve different role during early porcine embryonic development. ^ The second aim of the experiment was to find nuclear localization signal (NLS) regions in the histone methyltransferase G 9 a and the chromatin remodeling protein Brg 1, and their binding preference towards different KPNA members. G 9 a has one NLS, which functioned in vivo. Brg 1 has three NLS, one of which was showed function in vivo. ^ The third aim of the study was to determine the developmental requirements of Karyopherin α 3 (KPNA 3) during porcine embryonic development. Reducing KPNA 3 transcripts did not show a significant effect on porcine embryonic developmental competence. ^ Overall these results indicate that histone methyltransferases and nuclear trafficking may play distinct roles during <b>porcine</b> <b>embryo</b> development. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{to examine the effects of}} (-) -epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) supplementation on the developmental competence and quality of parthenogenetic <b>porcine</b> <b>embryos</b> during culture. Parthenogenetic embryos derived from in vitro matured oocytes were cultured for 8 days in a modified North Carolina State University (NCSU) - 37 solution supplemented with EGCG at different concentrations (0, 1, 5, 10, and 50 µM). Supplementation of 1 and 5 µM EGCG during in-vitro culture of embryos showed no significant influence on the rate of cleavage or that of blastocyst formation, or on the total cell number and DNA fragmentation indices of blastocysts when compared to those of a control group. However, when 10 and 50 µM EGCG were supplemented into the culture medium, the cleavage rates were significantly lower than those of the other groups. No embryo developed to the blastocyst stage.

This paper reviews about cytoplasmic maturation associated with the efficiency of in vitro production of <b>porcine</b> <b>embryos.</b> Traditionally, the failure to from a male pronucleus have been reported as serious problems in producing porcine emabryos following IVM and IVF. The problem of male pronuclear formation is currently considered to be mainly due to oxidative stress during IVM. More recently the developmental competence of embryos following IVM and IVF has been investigated through improvement of culture conditions for oocyte maturation. Currently, an acceptable rate of blastocyst formation {{and the birth of}} live piglets has been achieved by investigating affecting factors during IVM, IVF and IVC of porcine oocytes. Since the ovarian oocytes available for IVM are primarily those present in mid-size antral follicles of prepuberal gilts, {{more research is needed to}} gain an improved understanding of the factors associated with the developmental competence in oocytes from both preantral and antral follicles. 豚受精卵の体外生産を成功させるためには、体外成熟、体外受精および対外発生に必要な効率的な一連の技術の積み重ねが必要である。本総説は、効率的な豚受精卵の体外生産に関係する体外成熟中の諸要因について論じる。長い間、体外成熟卵子の体外受精後の雄性前核の形成不全は、体外受精卵を生産するための深刻な問題として、多くの研究者によって長い間研究されてきた。しかし現在では、雄性前核形成に関するこの問題は、すでに解決され、主に体外成熟中の酸化ストレスが原因であると考えられている。さらに最近、体外成熟・受精卵の初期発生能力は、卵成熟期間中の培養条件の改善を通じて飛躍的に改善されており、現在では、豚受精卵の初期発生に影響をおよぼす卵子成熟中の諸要因について研究によって、産業的に利用可能な胚盤胞受精卵作用効率およ産仔の生産効率が得られている。体外成熟可能な卵胞卵子は、通常春機発動以前の屠畜雌豚の卵巣に存在する中型成熟卵胞から回収されている。そこで、今後の研究において、春機発動以前の雌豚および性成熟を経た雌豚のそれぞれに存在する卵胞卵子の発生能力に影響をおぼす要因のさらなる理解が必要とされる...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In mouse embryos, {{segregation}} {{of the inner}} cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE) lineages is regulated by genes, such as OCT- 4, CDX 2 and TEAD 4. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the {{segregation of}} the ICM and TE lineages in <b>porcine</b> <b>embryos</b> remain unknown. To obtain insights regarding the segregation of the ICM and TE lineages in <b>porcine</b> <b>embryos,</b> we examined the mRNA expression patterns of candidate genes, OCT- 4, CDX 2, TEAD 4, GATA 3, NANOG, FGF 4, FGFR 1 -IIIc and FGFR 2 -IIIc, in blastocyst and elongated stage embryos. In blastocyst embryos, the expression levels of OCT- 4, FGF 4 and FGFR 1 -IIIc were significantly higher in the ICM than in the TE, while the CDX 2, TEAD 4 and GATA 3 levels did not differ between the ICM and TE. The expression ratio of CDX 2 to OCT- 4 (CDX 2 /OCT- 4) also did not differ between the ICM and TE at the blastocyst stage. In elongated embryos, OCT- 4, NANOG, FGF 4 and FGFR 1 -IIIc were abundantly expressed in the embryo disc (ED; ICM lineage), but their expression levels were very low in the TE. In contrast, the CDX 2, TEAD 4 and GATA 3 levels were significantly higher in the TE than in the ED. In addition, the CDX 2 /OCT- 4 ratio was markedly higher in the TE than in the ED. We demonstrated that differences in the expression levels of OCT- 4, CDX 2, TEAD 4, GATA 3, NANOG, FGF 4, FGFR 1 -IIIc and FGFR 2 -IIIc genes between ICM and TE lineages cells become more clear during development from porcine blastocyst to elongated embryos, which indicates the possibility that in <b>porcine</b> <b>embryos,</b> functions of ICM and TE lineage cells depend on these gene expressions proceed as transition from blastocyst to elongated stage...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{was to develop a}} simple successful porcine cryopreservation protocol that prevented contact between embryos and liquid nitrogen, avoiding potential contamination risks. In vivo-derived blastocysts were collected surgically from donor pigs, and two <b>porcine</b> <b>embryo</b> vitrification protocols (one used centrifugation to polarize intracytoplasmic lipids, whereas the other did not) were compared using the Cryologic Vitrification Method (CVM), which used solid surface vitrification. The CVM allowed embryos to be vitrified, without any contact between embryos and liquid nitrogen. Both protocols resulted in similar in vitro survival rates (90 % and 94 %) and cell number (89 ± 5 and 99 ± 5) after 48 h in vitro culture of vitrified and warmed blastocysts. The protocol that did not use centrifugation was selected for continued use. To protect vitrified embryos from contact with liquid nitrogen and potential contamination during storage, a sealed outer container was developed. Use of this sealed outer container did not affect in vitro survival of cryopreserved blastocysts. In vivo blastocysts (n = 151) were collected, vitrified, and stored using the selected protocol and sealed container. These embryos were subsequently warmed and transferred to six recipients; five became pregnant and farrowed a total of 26 piglets. This embryo vitrification method allowed porcine embryos to be successfully vitrified and stored without any contact with liquid nitrogen. L. F. S. Beebe, E. G. Bouwman, S. M. McIlfatrick, M. B.

40|$|Quinone reductase (QR; EC 1. 6. 99. 2) is {{recognized}} as a major antimutagenic/anticarcinogenic enzyme in the organism. Our recent studies demonstrated the presence of significant QR activity in the early human placenta; whether this enzyme is expressed by the mammalian embryo is not known at present. In the investigation reported here, we sought {{to determine whether or}} not QR activity is detected in porcine embryonal tissues and if so, how early this expression takes place. In addition, the enzyme activity in the embryo was compared to that present in adult porcine tissues. Enzyme activity was determined by a colorimetric method with menadione as substrate in the presence of tetrazolium salt (MTT). NADH was a preferable cofactor in the embryo, whereas in the adult tissues NADPH was a better cofactor. Results show that the enzyme is present in all the embryonal organs tested from a very early age (30 days of gestation), Among the organs tested, activity was highest in the <b>porcine</b> <b>embryo</b> liver, and the specific activity remained unchanged until Day 70. Activity in the embryonal kidney increased with advancing gestation. The enzyme activity in embryonal tissues was much lower than that measured in the adult liver (30 - 40 -fold). These findings suggest that the embryo has the potential for inactivating carcinogens/mutagens that will subsequently be eliminated by the maternal organism, thus protecting against adverse environmental impacts during the most critical period of development...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} was to determine farrowing rates and litter sizes that could be achieved in a typical farm-to-farm <b>porcine</b> <b>embryo</b> transfer program using vitrified blastocysts that were zona pellucida intact when cryopreserved. The embryos were transferred surgically on-farm into recipient sows that were managed throughout gestation and farrowing under the same conditions as other sows in the herd. Twenty recipient sows (mean parity 2. 1) received a total of 568 embryos; seven received 203 embryos derived from donor sows, five received 139 embryos from gilts and eight received a mixture of 161 embryos from sows and 65 from gilts. Sixteen sows (80 %) were confirmed pregnant at approximately 35 days gestation, 15 farrowed at full term (farrowing rate 75 %). One sow died during gestation (with a total of 18 fetuses in utero). A total of 123 piglets were born (mean, 8. 2), of which 115 were born alive (mean, 7. 7). Of the 568 embryos transferred to all 20 sows, 21. 6 % resulted in piglets born and 29. 0 % survived to produce piglets in sows that farrowed. There {{were no significant differences}} in embryo survival among sow, gilt or mixed sow and gilt embryos. The ratio of males to females was 71 / 52 and the mean birth weight was 1. 6 kg (range 0. 6 – 2. 6 kg).

40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{development}} of zygotes of domestic species to the blastocyst stage is facilitated by culture in groups, suggesting {{a role for}} autocrine/paracrine factors. A novel method was used to investigate the potential role of such factors using in-vitro-produced and in-vivo-derived <b>porcine</b> <b>embryos.</b> The development of individual zygotes to the blastocyst stage was optimal when they were cultured 81 – 160 μm apart. As {{the distance between the}} embryos was increased, blastocyst rates declined significantly, reaching zero beyond 640 μm. Blastocyst volume and cell number (both inner cell mass and trophectoderm) were also increased when the distance apart was between 81 and 160 μm. Culturing embryos in groups at different stages of development suggested that group culture confers a greater advantage to development after the activation of the genome. Group culture of in-vivo-derived embryos showed a weak distance effect. The results suggest a role for as yet unknown diffusible paracrine/autocrine factors released by early <b>porcine</b> <b>embryos</b> in promoting the growth of neighbouring embryos in vitro. This advantage is observed to a lesser extent by in-vivo-derived zygotes which are likely to have been better conditioned for development in vitro by being conceived in the female reproductive tract. ...|$|R
40|$|Between day 10 and 12 of {{gestation}} in the pig, {{the embryo}} undergoes a dramatic morphological change, known as elongation. During elongation the embryo produces and secretes estrogen, {{which serves as}} a key signal for maternal recognition of pregnancy. The uterine environment prepares for embryo elongation and implantation by releasing nutrients, metabolites, and hormones in a time-dependent manner relative to paracrine signals from the conceptus (i. e., estrogen) and endocrine/paracrine signals within the endometrium (i. e., progesterone). Despite advances in identification of specific uterine factors present throughout pregnancy in the pig, {{little is known about the}} exact mechanisms by which <b>porcine</b> <b>embryos</b> elongate normally, or how this elongation is altered during embryonic loss. Previously, our laboratory has established an in vitro culture system using alginate hydrogels as a three-dimensional (3 -D) matrix to support the development of pre-implantation <b>porcine</b> <b>embryos</b> in base serum media without the addition of hormones. The objective of the current study was to improve our 3 -D system and determine if uterine flushes from day 9 or 10 of gestation were capable of supporting in vitro embryonic development of in vivo-developed day 9 <b>porcine</b> <b>embryos</b> using the 3 - D alginate culture system. Embryos collected on day 9 of gestation were assigned to be cultured in pooled day 9 flushes, day 10 flushes, or base serum media for five days within 0. 7 % alginate gels. Our results demonstrate that uterine flushes from day 9 or 10 of gestation supported embryonic development in our 3 -D hydrogel system, similar to that from embryos cultured in base serum media. These results illustrate that soluble factors present in uterine flushings at day 9 or 10 of gestation support in vitro embryonic development within our 3 -D alginate culture system. Developing better scientific understanding of the factors that regulate embryo elongation and early embryonic mortality can be useful for developing strategies to improve sow productivity and increase the profitability of swine production...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} whether exogenous amino acids affect gene transcription patterns in parthenogenetic <b>porcine</b> <b>embryos,</b> we investigated {{the effects of}} amino acid mixtures in culture medium. Parthenogenetic embryos were cultured in PZM 3 medium under four experimental conditions: 1) control (no amino acids except L-glutamine and taurine); 2) nonessential amino acids (NEAA); 3) essential amino acids (EAA); and 4) NEAA and EAA. The rate of development of embryos to the four-cell stage was not affected by treatment. However, fewer (P< 0. 05) embryos cultured with EAA (12. 8 %) reached the blastocyst stage {{as compared with the}} control group (25. 6 %) and NEAA group (30. 3 %). Based on these findings, we identified genes with altered expression in parthenogenetic embryos exposed to medium with or without EAAs. The results indicated that EAA influenced gene expression patterns, particularly those of imprinted genes (e. g., H 19, IGF 2 R, PEG 1, XIST). However, NEAAs did not affect impaired imprinted gene expressions induced by EAA. The results also showed that mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR) mRNA expression was significantly increased by EAA alone as compared with control cultures, and that the combined treatment with NEAA and EAA did not differ significantly from those of control cultures. Our results revealed that gene transcription levels in <b>porcine</b> <b>embryos</b> changed differentially depending on the presence of EAA or NEAA. However, the changes in the H 19 mRNA observed in the parthenogenetic blastocysts expression level was not related to the DNA methylation status in the IGF 2 /H 19 domain. The addition of exogenous amino acid mixtures affected not only early embryonic development, but also gene transcription levels, particularly those of imprinted genes. However, this study did not reveal how amino acids affect expression of imprinted genes under the culture conditions used. Further studies are thus required to fully evaluate how amino acids affect transcriptional regulation in <b>porcine</b> <b>embryos...</b>|$|R
