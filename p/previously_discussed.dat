25|$|Other {{species that}} do not follow the <b>previously</b> <b>discussed</b> {{conventions}} of XX females and XY males must find alternative ways to equalize X-linked gene expression among differing sexes. For example, in Caenorhabditis elegans (or C. elegans), sex {{is determined by the}} ratio of X chromosomes relative to autosomes; worms with two X chromosomes (XX worms) develop as hermaphrodites, whereas those with only one X chromosome (XO worms) develop as males. This system of sex determination is unique, because there is no male specific chromosome, {{as is the case in}} XX/XY sex determination systems. However, as is the case with the <b>previously</b> <b>discussed</b> mechanisms of dosage compensation, failure to express X-linked genes appropriately can still be lethal.|$|E
25|$|Most plasma {{polymers}} are insoluble and infusible.

25|$|Because of its low boiling point, spent HF is {{regenerated}} by fractionation {{within the}} HF alkylation unit. However, fresh HF {{must still be}} brought into the refinery to replace the HF consumed. The unloading and handling of fresh HF must be undertaken with great care since this operation carries the same risk to the refinery workers and surrounding community from an HF release as <b>previously</b> <b>discussed.</b> Perhaps the greatest transportation risk related to HF is the potential release during an accident while transporting fresh acid from the manufacturer to the refinery. Since no mitigation equipment would be available at an accident site, the consequences could be catastrophic.|$|E

They once again compared tenure in the League of Communists of Croatia and SDP, their personal properties as well as moral values. Josipović called on Bandić to compare their physical and stock properties in court, which the latter refused. There was some talk of endorsements, and some reflections on talking points. They finished in a more cordial tone with the mention of future private visits as well as family pets.|$|E
25|$|In 1958, {{the changed}} voices were finally allowed {{to join the}} {{unchanged}} voices; the KUBG approved a trial period for their inclusion.

On August 23, 1958, the first rehearsal with eight changed voices took place, and Ulbrich announced in January, 1959, that their inclusion would be made permanent. However, since no tenors could be found until 1962, the deepest boys' voices and the voices {{still in the process}} of changing were used to sing the tenor parts. In 1959, the <b>previously</b> <b>discussed</b> name change finally took place: the choir became the Evangelische Kantorei Basel ("Basel Protestant Choir") and became directly controlled by the consistory.|$|E

25|$|Rail {{transport}} {{returned to}} the Twin Cities {{with the construction of}} the Blue Line, which began operations in 2004. A proposal for a heritage streetcar line running east-west through the city, possibly including PCC cars once owned by TCRT, has been examined. A new Northstar commuter rail line, tracing U.S. Highway 10 northwest out of Minneapolis, opened in 2009. A connection between both of the twin cities, called the Green Line, opened on June 14, 2014. Light rail west from Minneapolis to the southwest suburbs is currently in the preliminary engineering phase of planning/construction. Other proposals have included adding both a commuter connection to the complete North and Southeast of downtown Saint Paul. A light rail alignment to the Southwest of downtown Saint Paul has been <b>previously</b> <b>discussed,</b> but dismissed due to the expectation of low ridership.|$|E
25|$|When first published, The Lives of John Lennon was {{controversial}} {{because of}} its portrayal of Lennon in a highly critical light. Lennon was presented in the book as a talented but deeply flawed man who manipulated people and relationships throughout his life, flinging them aside when {{they were no longer}} useful to him. Goldman also suggested that Lennon was an anti-Semite and a heavy drug-user and that he had dyslexia and schizophrenia. The author even went into detail about the long-rumored homosexual affair between Lennon and The Beatles' manager Brian Epstein (<b>previously</b> <b>discussed</b> in both Pete Shotton's Lennon in My Life and Peter Brown's The Love You Make books), as well as alleging a number of liaisons by Lennon with other men, including a claim that he solicited underage male prostitutes in Thailand. This latter assertion greatly angered Yoko Ono and Paul McCartney. The book was criticized by Lennon fans for allegedly containing much unsubstantiated conjecture, and tending to present worst-case scenarios when doing so.|$|E
25|$|Arndt {{worked on}} the script for eight months, but said he needed 18 more, which was more time than Disney or Abrams could give him. The {{production}} announced Arndt's exit from the project on October 24, 2013, and Kasdan and Abrams took over script duties. Abrams expressed relief that the release date was announced for December 2015 instead of a <b>previously</b> <b>discussed</b> summer release. He and Kasdan planned the story while walking in Santa Monica, New York City, Paris and London. The first draft was completed in six weeks. Abrams said that the key for the film was {{to return to the}} roots of the first Star Wars film and be based more on emotion than explanation. In January 2014, Abrams confirmed that the script was complete. In April 2014, Lucasfilm clarified that Episodes VII–IX would not feature storylines from the Star Wars expanded universe, though other elements could be included as with the TV series Star Wars Rebels.|$|E

25|$|Pike {{make use}} of the lateral line system to follow the {{vortices}} produced by the perceived prey, and the whirling movement of the spinner is probably a good way to imitate or exaggerate these. Jerkbaits are also effective and can produce spectacular bites with pike attacking these erratic-moving lures at full speed. For trolling, big plugs or softbaits can be used. Spoons with mirror finishes are very effective when the sun is at a sharp angle to the water in the mornings or evenings because they generate the vibrations <b>previously</b> <b>discussed</b> and cause a glint of reflective sunlight that mimics the flash of white-bellied prey. Most fishermen tend to use small lures, but often that is not advisable because pike have a preference for large prey. When fishing in shallow water for smaller pike, lighter and smaller lures are frequently used. The humble 'woolly bugger' fly is a favourite lure among keen fly fisherman of the southern hemisphere.|$|E

Seeking an alternative graphics chip for the Saturn, Kalinske attempted to broker a deal with Silicon Graphics, but Sega of Japan rejected the proposal. Silicon Graphics subsequently collaborated with Nintendo on the Nintendo 64. Kalinske, Sony Electronic Publishing's Olaf Olafsson, and Sony America's Micky Schulhof had <b>previously</b> <b>discussed</b> development of a joint [...] "Sega/Sony hardware system", which never came to fruition due to Sega's desire to create hardware that could accommodate both 2D and 3D visuals and Sony's competing notion of focusing entirely on 3D technology.

500|$|After the meeting, Justice Minister Tuija Brax {{said that}} Finland's laws {{pertaining}} to gun ownership should be reviewed [...] "as soon as possible", and Finance Minister Jyrki Katainen pledged government action. Neither specified what measures {{the government would}} be taking. Finland's population owned an averaged total of 2.9 million firearms within a population of 5.2 million people, and thus ranked as having the third highest gun ownership rate in the world, behind only the US and Yemen, according to a 2007 small arms survey {{carried out by the}} Graduate Institute of International Studies. The government had <b>previously</b> <b>discussed</b> raising the minimum age for owning a gun from 15 (with parental consent) to 18 after the Jokela High School shooting (Pekka-Eric Auvinen, the shooter in that incident, was aged 18), but no law regarding this had taken effect.|$|E
500|$|Long {{thought to}} be a Mesozoic phenomenon, {{evidence}} for herbivory is found almost as soon as fossils which could show it. As <b>previously</b> <b>discussed,</b> the first land plants emerged around 450 million years ago; however, herbivory, and therefore the need for plant defenses, has undoubtedly been around for longer. Herbivory first evolved due to marine organisms within ancient lakes and oceans. [...] Within under 20 million years of the first fossils of sporangia and stems towards the close of the Silurian, around , there is evidence that they were being consumed. Animals fed on the spores of early Devonian plants, and the Rhynie chert also provides evidence that organisms fed on plants using a [...] "pierce and suck" [...] technique. Many plants of this time are preserved with spine-like enations, which may have performed a defensive role before being co-opted to develop into leaves.|$|E
