40|$|The {{systematic}} co-operation in R&D involving {{two or more}} enterprises or companies {{working with}} research organisations, suppliers, customers or even competitors has become a popular instrument of strategic management. As new empirical results from the IfM Bonn show, {{more than a quarter}} of all enterprises in the industrial sector and the industry-related services in Germany are participating in strategic partnerships of this kind. Strategic partnerships in R&D, which lead to new products or process innovations, have positive effects on a firm´s competitive position. Governmental policy in Germany has recognized its importance for the economy and therefore provides financial aid for R&D-active enterprises. From the perspective of regional science the question is whether R&D co-operations have gained equal popularity all over the country or whether significant regional differences have to be taken into account. This paper examines determinants on enterprises participating in R&D co-operations with particular emphasis on regional influences. Data from a postal questionnaire was taken to form a sample of approx. 950 enterprises located all over the country. To establish the determinants and their relative influence a logistic regression is estimated. Further regional comparisons in R&D activities are carried out by chi-square-tests. The results of the bivariate analyses highlight regional differences in <b>partnerships</b> <b>between</b> <b>enterprises</b> and research organisations. It is remarkable that enterprises in the federal states which have the biggest problems in coping with structural changes, the East-German states, participate significantly more frequently in these partnerships than their West-German counterparts. However, the results of the logistic regression provide no evidence for regional differences concerning R&D co-operations on the whole. Not the location but structural features of the enterprises matter. For instance, plant size is positively associated with R&D co-operation: larger enterprises are more cooperation-oriented than smaller enterprises. Furthermore, the analysis identifies company-specific conditions that enable them to join R&D co-operations. Besides that, emphasis is put, for example, on experiences with other forms of strategic partnerships. The presence of company-owned R&D facilities is another requirement to find a chance to co-operate in most of the cases. Other variables such as the degree of monopoly power or the market structure do not influence the plant´s capacity to join R&D partnerships. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Partnerships</b> <b>between</b> tourism <b>enterprises</b> and {{protected}} area managers are widely promoted as means to generate mutually beneficial outcomes. This paper {{reports on a}} study that examined the effectiveness of twenty-one tourism partnerships associated with protected areas across Australia. Quantitative and qualitative surveys of partnership participants were used to identify the most important features of the partnerships and analyse the relationships between these features and outcomes for participants, {{as well as for}} sustainability more generally. Important outcomes for the partners included economic gains for protected areas and tourism businesses; improved availability of information; improved relationships; adoption of innovative approaches to problems-solving; and reduced conflict between partners. Important sustainability outcomes included improved understanding of the values of protected areas; improved biodiversity conservation; greater respect for culture, heritage and traditions; increased engagement of local communities in tourism; and increased local social and economic benefits. Partnership-related features that influenced these outcomes included open communication; inclusive participation; partners' commitment; adaptability to changing circumstances; leadership by {{at least one of the}} partners; agreement on the purpose and direction of the partnership; identification and allocation of partners' roles and powers; agreements and regulations supporting the partnership and tourism in protected areas; sufficient resources; and an understanding other partners' viewpoints.

40|$|The multidimensional social {{problems}} that everyone seeks to remedy {{them are very}} complex and no actor can confront them on their own.

40|$|Self-employment {{promotion}} for {{poverty reduction}} has been administered through microcredit programs in Bangladesh. While microcredit {{has opened up}} new opportunities for the poor to start enterprises, {{some of them have}} not benefited from microcredit schemes. To enable the poor left behind to participate in the rural economy as entrepreneurs, this paper proposes the creation of a <b>partnership</b> <b>enterprise</b> <b>between</b> a sponsor and poor producers. In this partnership, the sponsor as a master trader supports partner-producers financially, technically and managerially through a subcontracting arrangement. The paper develops this conceptual relationship in a real rural setting through the observation of an income-generating program implemented by a Bangladeshi NGO in the field of poultry-rearing. This empirical form of partnership enterprise suggests an opportunity for the poor to enter into a previously inaccessible market and gain a regular income source, which builds the foundation of their household economy beyond subsistence.

40|$|The {{concept of}} the finite planet underpins all {{education}} for sustainability in its current and future forms and iterations. This chapter describes the opportunities available across the formal school and tourism sectors to educate together for a more sustainable means of organizing our lives. International frameworks for environmental education and education for sustainability are described and the Australian frameworks developed {{in response to the}} United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (UNDESD) are explained. Education for sustainability "promotes learning beyond the boundaries of educational institutions" to equip people "with the knowledge, skills and values to address [the] social, environmental and economic challenges of the 21 st century" including preparing for jobs that "preserve or restore the quality of the environment" (UNESCO. Five reasons to support ESD—education for sustainable development. [URL] 2013). Educators, interpreters and communicators can create networks and relationships for action and learning. There are many variations on this theme of cooperation and accommodation. The formal education sector is porous. The tourism enterprise sector has a huge impact to make in terms of educating and interpreting for sustainability. Aspects of the sustainability cross curriculum priority in the new Australian Curriculum support recalibrating learning practices that enhance sustainability through building <b>partnerships</b> <b>between</b> tourism <b>enterprises</b> and schools. Contemporary policy and curriculum support education for sustainability and the challenge for tourism is to innovate new ways of organizing educational practice.
