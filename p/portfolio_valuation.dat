The models chosen for actuarial calculations have to capture the survival trend and to pr oject its forecasted future impr ovements.

Aim of the paper is to measure the uncertainty risk and to show its trend in severa l contexts, meaningful in <b>portfolio</b> <b>valuations.</b> To this purpose the authors provide a suitable risk index and apply it in three different valuations: the initial value of an immediate life annuity portfolio; the fund of a pension annuity portfolio; the surplus of a portfolio consisting of deferred life annuities.

50|$|The {{modified}} Dietz {{method has}} the practical {{advantage over the}} true time-weighted rate of return method, in that the calculation of a modified Dietz return does not require <b>portfolio</b> <b>valuations</b> at each point in time whenever an external flow occurs.

5000|$|Calculating the [...] "true time-weighted return" [...] {{depends on}} the {{availability}} of <b>portfolio</b> <b>valuations</b> during the investment period. If valuations are not available when each flow occurs, the time-weighted return can only be estimated by linking returns for contiguous sub-periods together geometrically, using sub-periods {{at the end of which}} valuations are available. Such an approximate time-weighted return method is prone to overstate or understate the true time-weighted return.|$|R
50|$|To {{measure the}} risk induced by a model, {{it has to}} be {{compared}} to an alternative model, or a set of alternative benchmark models. The problem is how to choose these benchmark models. In the context of derivative pricing Cont (2006) proposes a quantitative approach to measurement of model risk exposures in derivatives portfolios: first, a set of benchmark models is specified and calibrated to market prices of liquid instruments, then the target portfolio is priced under all benchmark models. A measure of exposure to model risk is then given by the difference between the current <b>portfolio</b> <b>valuation</b> and the worst-case valuation under the benchmark models. Such a measure may be used as a way of determining a reserve for model risk for derivatives portfolios.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{decomposition}} of opportune tools in order to value continuos annuities in an enviroment in which both future rates of returns and mortality are stochastic. By means of stochastic instruments involving the discounting process, {{in the first part}} of the paper, the first two moments of the present value of a continuos life annuity are calculated and, generalizing traditional techniques, the riskiness connected to it is estimeted. On the other side aim of the paper is to take into account also the evolution of mortality and its consequences in valuation of annuities. Therefore, in the second part of the paper a portfolio of continuos annuities under deterministic assumptions about the rates of return is considered, and also by means of numerical exemples, the influence of mortality projections on <b>portfolio</b> <b>valuations</b> is shown. The analysis takes into account the measure of the risk deriving from different projections...|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{the thesis}} is to {{formulate}} a concept of liquidity risk and to incorporate liquidity risk in market risk measurement. We first review two types of liquidity risk and the relation between liquidity risk and market risk. To achieve our aim, we use a new framework of portfolio theory introduced by Acerbi. A novelty of Acerbi’s framework is that <b>portfolio</b> <b>valuation</b> includes a consideration of liquidity risk in <b>portfolio</b> <b>valuation.</b> Under the new framework, the valuation of a portfolio becomes a convex optimization problem. We give some examples of calculation schemes for the convex optimization problem. Equipped with the new portfolio theory, we can quantify market liquidity risk and introduce a new market risk measure which includes the impact of liquidity risk. We end the thesis by giving some possible questions for further study. Applied mathematicsElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|E
40|$|We {{explore the}} {{implications}} of a country’s external constraint for the dynamics of net foreign assets, returns, and exchange rates. Deteriorations in external accounts imply future trade surpluses (trade channel) or excess returns on the net foreign <b>portfolio</b> (<b>valuation</b> channel). Using a new data set on U. S. gross external positions, we find that stabilizing valuation effects contribute 27 percent of the cyclical external adjustment. Our approach has asset-pricing implications: external imbalances predict net foreign portfolio returns one quarter to two years ahead and net export growth at longer horizons.

40|$|Previous {{mortgage}} prepayment and valuation models {{assume that}} two mortgage pools {{with the same}} observable characteristics should behave indistinguishably. However, even pools with apparently identical characteristics often exhibit markedly different prepayment behavior. The sources of this heterogeneity may be unobservable, but we can infer information about a pool from its prepayment behavior over time. This paper develops a methodology for using this information to calculate pool-specific mortgage-backed security prices. Knowledge of these prices is important both for <b>portfolio</b> <b>valuation</b> and for determining the cheapest pool to deliver when selling mortgage-backed securities. We find that unobservable heterogeneity between mortgage pools is statistically significant, and that pool-specific prices, calculated for a sample of outwardly identical mortgage pools between 1983 and 1989, may di#er greatly from any single representative price...|$|E

Optimal engineering design typically deals with determining the best product based on technological (and, occasionally, cost) requirements. Linking technological with business decisions allows the firm to follow a product valuation process that directly considers not only what assets to invest but also what are the appropriate physical properties of these assets. Thus, optimal designs are determined within a business context that maximizes the firm’s value.
