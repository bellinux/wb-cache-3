25|$|The simple phenols are not {{the only}} active element in wood-tar creosote. In solution, they {{coagulate}} albumin, which is a water-soluble protein found in meat; so they serve as a <b>preserving</b> <b>agent,</b> but also cause denaturation. Most of the phenols in the creosote are methoxy derivatives—they contain the methoxy group linked to the benzene nucleus (OCH3). The high level of methyl derivates created from the action of heat on wood (also apparent in the methyl alcohol produced through distillation) make wood-tar creosote substantially different from coal-tar creosote. Guaiacol is a methyl ether of pyrocatechin, while creosol is a methyl ether of methyl-pyrocatechin, the next homolog of pyrocatechin. Methyl ethers differ from simple phenols in being less hydrophilic, caustic and poisonous. This allows meat to successfully be preserved without tissue denaturation, and allows creosote {{to be used as a}} medical ointment.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} {{was to develop a}} {{database}} of <b>preserving</b> <b>agents</b> for the treatment of farming machinery {{on the basis of a}} comparison to evaluate anticorrosive efficiency of these preservatives in the laboratory and atmospheric tests. Another objective was to determine amounts of individual preservatives required per a square meter and to define costs of their use. In addition to the determination of the protective efficiency of the preservatives, another goal of the work was to demonstrate the influence of environment on the corrosion rate and extent. A database of <b>preserving</b> <b>agents</b> available on the market which are designed for temporary protection of materials, machines and equipment was developed for this dissertation.

5000|$|Salt {{has been}} added into foods for decades to enhance the flavor and texture of meals for {{consumers}} and their satisfaction. Flavor {{is made up of}} taste and aroma. Salty is one of the 4 main tastes humans can sense. Adding salt to foods such as macaroons, can help specific molecules release more easily into the air, thus helping with the aroma and making consumers want to purchase the product eve moreso if it smells delicious. It also acts as a <b>preserving</b> <b>agent</b> by binding the water in foods so that spoilage causing microorganisms do not have sufficient water to grow and develop. This greatly has an impact on the shelf life of macaroons. To accentuate the sweetness of the macaroons, a pinch of salt is added during cooking.

Glycerol possesses the intrinsic property of not denaturing or rendering a botanical's constituents inert (as alcohols - i.e. ethyl (grain) alcohol, methyl (wood) alcohol, etc., do).

50|$|The cheeses {{are removed}} from the presses and put onto pallets which are then {{immersed}} in a bath of salty water for 2 or 3 hours, according to the size. Salting has several functions: it affects the taste, crust formation and is a <b>preserving</b> <b>agent.</b> The cheeses are then ready to be matured in the cellar where they will lose some weight {{in accordance with the}} age-old tradition of the “Angels’ share”.Cheeses are aged in the vaulted cellars of the abbey where the temperature is maintained at 14 C, with high humidity. They will be turned manually every other day. To maintain the crust and encourage the development of the mould on the surface, the cheeses are again bathed in brine and then rubbed and returned to the shelves to mature. The mould is naturally present in the cellar. When they have attained their optimum maturity, they are packed and labeled by hand. The label conveys important manufacturing information and the best-before date (about 45 days after packing).|$|E

The creosote can be obtained by distilling the wood tar and treating the fraction heavier than water with a sodium hydroxide solution. The alkaline solution is then separated from the insoluble oily layer, boiled in contact with air to reduce impurities, and decomposed by diluted sulphuric acid. This produces a crude creosote, which is purified by re-solution in alkali and re-precipitation with acid and then redistilled with the fraction passing over between 200° and 225° constituting the purified creosote.|$|E

40|$|Salting and {{subsequent}} curing {{are part of}} the traditional processing method used in the meat and fish industry. Different <b>preserving</b> <b>agents</b> (sodium chloride, nitrite, nitrate, among others) are added in this process. Nowadays, more attention is paid to the amount of salts added and the salting time employed. For this reason, {{it is important to know}} the factors governing salt penetration and the most convenient process conditions. The transfer mechanism of the salts through the structure is an interesting aspect in meat and fish processing technology. Mathematical models are the best way to discover the factors, which govern this process, which may represent and explain the observed data and predict the behaviour under different conditions. The objective of this review is to describe the use of the mathematical models to simulate meat and fish salting and the benefits derived from their use. Most of the models used to describe the salting process are diffusional, based on Fick’s second law, although empirical ones are also used. For modelling purposes a good description of the experimental results should be guaranteed.
