40|$|Three-year {{trials were}} {{conducted}} to study germination and emergence of prickly lettuce (Lactuca serriola L.) achenes, increments of shoot dry matter and susceptibility of the weed to selected herbicides. The germination rates of achenes at 10 °C (92 %), 20 °C (97 %) and 30 °C (95 %) did not indicate any significant differences within 20 days from sowing. The highest percentage emergence of prickly lettuce achenes was determined after their sowing into a depth of 1 mm. Differ-ences from the variants of sowing onto the soil surface (0 mm), into a depth of 10 and 20 mm were significant. There were no differences in the emergence rates from a depth of 10 and 20 mm. The highest increments of shoot dry matter were observed when prickly lettuce plants were grown for 4 – 7 weeks after sowing at 20 °C. The effect of selected herbi-cides on prickly lettuce plants treated at the stage of 2 – 3 true leaves was evaluated {{on the basis of}} a change in the content of shoot dry matter. A significant decrease in dry matter against the control was recorded in all variants after herbicide application. The effect (expressed by a lower dry matter content) was significantly higher after the combination ami-dosulfuron + iodosulfuron-methyl + mefenpyr-diethyl (10 + 2. 5 + 25 g/ha) was used than after the application of tribe-nuron (10. 85 g/ha) and <b>picolinafen</b> + cyanazine (120 g + 480 h). The effect of amidosulfuron (22. 5 g/ha) was significantly higher than in the variants treated with tribenuron, picloram + clopyralid (16. 75 + 66. 75 g/ha), clopyralid (90 g/ha) and <b>picolinafen</b> + cyanazine (150 + 600 g/ha). The best effects were produced by herbicides containing amidosulfuron and iodosulfuron as active ingredients...|$|E
40|$|Three natural somatic {{mutations}} at codon 304 of the phytoene desaturase gene (pds) of Hydrilla verticillata (L. f. Royle) {{have been}} reported to provide resistance to the herbicide fluridone. We substituted the arginine 304 present in the wild-type H. verticillata phytoene desaturase (PDS) with all 19 other natural amino acids and tested PDS against fluridone. In in vitro assays, the threonine (Thr), cysteine (Cys), alanine (Ala) and glutamine (Gln) mutations imparted the highest resistance to fluridone. Thr, the three natural mutations [Cys, serine (Ser), histidine (His) ] and the wild-type PDS protein were tested in vitro against seven inhibitors of PDS representing several classes of herbicides. These mutations conferred cross-resistance to norflurazon and overall negative cross-resistance to beflubutamid, <b>picolinafen</b> and diflufenican. The T 3 generation of transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants harbouring the four selected mutations and wild-type pds had similar patterns of crossresistance to the herbicides as observed in the in vitro assays. The Thr 304 Hydrilla pds mutant proved to be an excellent marker for the selection of transgenic plants. Seedlings harbouring Thr 304 pds had a maximum resistance to sensitivity (R/S) ratio of 57 and 14 times higher than that of the wild-type for treatments with norflurazon and fluridone, respectively. These plants exhibited normal growth and development, even after long-term exposure to herbicide. As Thr 304 pds is of plant origin, it could become more acceptable than other selectable markers for use in genetically modified food...|$|E
