But do not believe them, says St. Paul. They are deceivers, and their words are vain. These are the very things which bring down God's wrath on His disobedient children. These are the bad ways which make young people, when they are married, despise, and distrust, and quarrel with each other, and live miserable lives together, as children of wrath, peevish, and wrathful, and discontented with each other, because they feel that God is angry with them, just as Adam in the garden, when {{he felt that he}} had sinned, and that God was wroth with him, laid the blame on his wife, and accused her, whom he ought to have loved, and protected, and excused.|$|E
60|$|Without {{intention}} my mind grew full of fancies on {{the nature}} of the forest; on the whole philosophy of mystery and force. For the meaning of woods is the combination of energy with complexity. A forest is not in the least rude or barbarous; it is only dense with delicacy. Unique shapes that an artist would copy or a philosopher watch for years if he found them in an open plain are here mingled and confounded; but it is not a darkness of deformity. It is a darkness of life; a darkness of perfection. And I began to think how much of the highest human obscurity is like this, and how much men have misunderstood it. <b>People</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> for instance, that theology became elaborate because it was dead. Believe me, if it had been dead it would never have become elaborate; it is only the live tree that grows too many branches.|$|E
6000|$|... 10. Thus far our art {{has been}} {{strictly}} utilitarian having respect to conditions of collision, of carriage, and of support. But now, {{on the surface}} of our piece of pottery, here are various bands and spots of colour which are presumably set there to make it pleasanter to the eye. Six of the spots, seen closely, you discover are intended to represent flowers. These then have as distinctly a graphic purpose as the other properties of the plate have an architectural one, and the first critical question we have to ask about them is, whether they are like roses or not. I will anticipate what I have to say in subsequent lectures so far as to assure you that, {{if they are to be}} like roses at all, the liker they can be, the better. Do not suppose, as many <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> that because this is a common manufactured article, your roses on it are the better for being ill-painted, or half-painted. If they had been painted by the same hand that did this peach, the plate would have been all the better for it; but, as it chanced, there was no hand such as William Hunt's to paint them, and their graphic power is not distinguished. In any case, however, that graphic power must have been subordinate to their effect as pink spots, while the band of green-blue round the plate's edge, and the spots of gold, pretend to no graphic power at all, but are meaningless spaces of colour or metal. Still less have they any mechanical office: they add nowise to the serviceableness of the plate; and their agreeableness, if they possess any, depends, therefore, neither on any imitative, nor any structural, character; but on some inherent pleasantness in themselves, either of mere colours to the eye (as of taste to the tongue), or in the placing of those colours in relations which obey some mental principle of order, or physical principle of harmony.|$|E

60|$|But {{perhaps you}} {{will say that}} it is because the living people talk of things that are passing, and are of {{immediate}} interest to you, that you desire to hear them. Nay; that cannot be so, for the living <b>people</b> <b>will</b> themselves <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> about passing matters much better in their writings than in their careless talk. Yet I admit that this motive does influence you, so far as you prefer those rapid and ephemeral writings to slow and enduring writings--books, properly so called. For all books are divisible into two classes, the books of the hour, and the books of all time. Mark this distinction--it is not one of quality only. It is not merely the bad book that does not last, and the good one that does. It is a distinction of species. There are good books for the hour, and good ones for all time; bad books for the hour, and bad ones for all time. I must define the two kinds before I go farther.|$|R
60|$|There are a {{great many}} <b>people</b> who <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that such a policy, as I have been endeavouring to outline to you this afternoon, will not make our country stronger, because it will sap the {{self-reliance}} of the working classes. It is very easy for rich people to preach the virtues of self-reliance to the poor. It is also very foolish, because, {{as a matter of}} fact, the wealthy, so far from being self-reliant, are dependent on the constant attention of scores, and sometimes even hundreds, of persons who are employed in waiting upon them and ministering to their wants. I think you will agree with me, on the other hand--knowing what you do of the life of this city and of the working classes generally--that there are often trials and misfortunes which come upon working-class families quite beyond any provision which their utmost unaided industry and courage could secure for them. Left to themselves, left absolutely to themselves, they must be smashed to pieces, if any exceptional disaster or accident, like recurring sickness, like the death or incapacity of the breadwinner, or prolonged or protracted unemployment, fall upon them.|$|R
6000|$|The reasons {{put forward}} by the South for secession have been trifling almost beyond conception. Northern tariffs have been the first, and perhaps foremost. Then {{there has been a}} plea that the {{national}} exchequer has paid certain bounties to New England fishermen, of which the South has paid its share, getting no part of such bounty in return. There is also a complaint as to the navigation laws--meaning, I believe, that the laws of the States increase the cost of coast traffic by forbidding foreign vessels to engage in the trade, thereby increasing also the price of goods and confining the benefit to the North, which carries on the coasting trade of the country, and doing only injury to the South, which has none of it. Then last, but not least, comes that grievance as to the Fugitive Slave Law. The law of the land as a whole--the law of the nation--requires the rendition from free States of all fugitive slaves. But the free States will not obey this law. They even pass State laws in opposition to it, [...] "Catch your own slaves," [...] they say, [...] "and we will not hinder you; at any rate we will not hinder you officially. Of non-official hinderance you must take your chance. But we absolutely decline to employ our officers to catch your slaves." [...] That list comprises, as I take it, the amount of Southern official grievances. Southern <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> privately of others. They will say that they cannot sleep happy in their beds, fearing lest insurrection should be roused among their slaves. They will tell you of domestic comfort invaded by Northern falsehood. They will explain to you how false has been Mrs. Beecher Stowe. Ladies will fill your ears and your hearts too with tales of the daily efforts they make for the comfort of their [...] "people," [...] and of the ruin to those efforts which arises from the malice of the abolitionists. To all this you make some answer with your tongue that is hardly true--for in such a matter courtesy forbids the plain truth. But your heart within answers truly, [...] "Madam, dear madam, your sorrow is great; but that sorrow is the necessary result of your position." ...|$|E
6000|$|This {{woman was}} drowned; {{but more often}} the persons who are taken 'get the touch,' as it is called, and fall into a half dream, and grow {{indifferent}} to all things, for their true life {{has gone out of}} the world, and is among the hills and the forts of the Sidhe. A faery doctor has told me that his wife 'got the touch' at her marriage because there was one of them wanted her; and the way he knew for certain was, that when he took a pitchfork out of the rafters, and told her it was a broom, she said, 'It is a broom.' She was, the truth is, in the magical sleep, to which people have given a new name lately, that makes the imagination so passive that it can be moulded by any voice in any world into any shape. A mere likeness of some old woman, or even old animal, some one or some thing the Sidhe have no longer a use for, is believed to be left instead of the person who is 'away;' this some one or some thing can, it is thought, be driven away by threats, or by violence (though I have heard country women say that violence is wrong), which perhaps awakes the soul out of the magical sleep. The story in the poem is founded on an old Gaelic ballad that was sung and translated for me by a woman at Ballisodare in County Sligo; but in the ballad the husband found the keeners keening his wife when he got to his house. She was 'swept' at once; but the Sidhe are said to value those the most whom they but cast into a half dream, which may last for years, for they need the help of a living person in most of the things they do. There are many stories of people who seem to die and be buried--though the country <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> it is but some one or some thing put in their place that dies and is buried--and yet are brought back afterwards. These tales are perhaps memories of true awakenings out of the magical sleep, moulded by the imagination, under the influence of a mystical doctrine which it understands too literally, into the shape of some well-known traditional tale. One does not hear them as one hears the others, from the persons who are 'away,' or from their wives or husbands; and one old man, who had often seen the Sidhe, began one of them with 'Maybe it is all vanity.' ...|$|E

Mr Eales shared his experiences as a sportsman with alumni and staff of the University. He particularly encouraged the alumni to “follow their hearts and not rest on their laurels”. “Find mentors; surround yourself with <b>people</b> who <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{what you need to}} hear, not what you want to hear – and I know at times this can be challenging,” he said.

This night is a celebration of the pioneering spirit of our first graduates. Professor Hammond also expressed that while the majority may not get the opportunity to lead the Wallabies, or the like, they can learn from John the main elements of striving for great heights and making the most of their talents as he has done. ” Manager of Alumni on the Sydney Campus, Ms Trish Egan, said the dinner was a great way for students who have graduated to reconnect with each other. “Tonight is an important opportunity for our alumni to reunite and to reflect on their time at Notre Dame. ” Media Contact: Rebecca Palser, (02) 8204 440...|$|R

You'd better take an axe with you to open their skulls; there is no other way." [...] How this legend started I don't know, but I think it is because the English are jealous of the Scotch. They got into the Union with them in 1707 and they can't get out. The Scotch don't want Home Rule, or Swa Raj, or Dominion status, or anything; they just want the English. When they want money they go to London and make it; if they want {{literary}} fame they sell their books to the English; and to prevent any kind of political trouble they take care to keep the Cabinet well filled with Scotchmen.

6000|$|Christmas time! That {{man must}} be a misanthrope indeed, in whose breast {{something}} like a jovial feeling is not roused—in whose mind some pleasant associations are not awakened—by the recurrence of Christmas. There are <b>people</b> who <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that Christmas is not to them {{what it used to}} be; that each succeeding Christmas has found some cherished hope, or happy prospect, of the year before, dimmed or passed away; that the present only serves to remind them of reduced circumstances and straitened incomes—of the feasts they once bestowed on hollow friends, and of the cold looks that meet them now, in adversity and misfortune. Never heed such dismal reminiscences. There are few men who have lived long enough in the world, who cannot call up such thoughts any day in the year. Then do not select the merriest of the three hundred and sixty-five for your doleful recollections, but draw your chair nearer the blazing fire—fill the glass and send round the song—and if your room be smaller than it was a dozen years ago, or if your glass be filled with reeking punch, instead of sparkling wine, put a good face on the matter, and empty it off-hand, and fill another, and troll off the old ditty you used to sing, and thank God it’s no worse. Look on the merry faces of your children (if you have any) as they sit round the fire. One little seat may be empty; one slight form that gladdened the father’s heart, and roused the mother’s pride to look upon, may not be there. Dwell not upon the past; think not that one short year ago, the fair child now resolving into dust, sat before you, with the bloom of health upon its cheek, and the gaiety of infancy in its joyous eye. Reflect upon your present blessings—of which every man has many—not on your past misfortunes, of which all men have some. Fill your glass again, with a merry face and contented heart.
