2500|$|Some methods melt or {{soften the}} {{material}} to produce the layers. In Fused filament fabrication, also known as Fused deposition modeling (FDM), the model or part is produced by extruding small beads or streams of material which harden immediately to form layers. A filament of thermoplastic, metal wire, or other material is fed into an extrusion nozzle head (3D printer extruder), which heats the material and turns the flow on and off. FDM is somewhat restricted in the variation of shapes that may be fabricated. Another technique fuses parts of the layer and then moves upward in the working area, adding another layer of granules and repeating the process until the piece has built up. This process uses the unfused media to support overhangs and thin walls in the part being produced, which reduces the need for temporary auxiliary supports for the piece. Laser sintering techniques include selective laser sintering, with both metals and polymers, and direct metal laser sintering. Selective laser melting does not use sintering for the fusion of powder granules but will completely melt the powder using a high-energy laser to create fully dense materials in a layer-wise method that has mechanical properties {{similar to those of}} conventional manufactured metals. Electron beam melting is a similar type of additive manufacturing technology for metal parts (e.g. titanium alloys). EBM manufactures parts by melting metal powder layer by layer with an electron beam in a high vacuum. Another method consists of an inkjet 3D printing system, which creates the model one layer at a time by spreading a layer of powder (plaster, or resins) and printing a binder in the cross-section of the part using an inkjet-like process. With laminated object manufacturing, thin layers are cut to shape and joined together. [...] Other methods cure liquid materials using different sophisticated technologies, such as stereolithography. Photopolymerization is primarily used in stereolithography to produce a solid part from a liquid. Inkjet printer systems like the Objet PolyJet system spray photopolymer materials onto a build tray in ultra-thin layers (between 16 and 30µm) until the part is completed. Each photopolymer layer is cured with UV light after it is jetted, producing fully cured models that can be handled and used immediately, without post-curing. Ultra-small features can be made with the 3D micro-fabrication technique used in multiphoton photopolymerisation. Due to the nonlinear nature of photo excitation, the gel is cured to a solid only in the places where the laser was focused while the remaining gel is then washed away. Feature sizes of under 100nm are easily produced, as well as complex structures with moving and interlocked parts. Yet another approach uses a synthetic resin that is solidified using LEDs. In Mask-image-projection-based stereolithography, a 3D digital model is sliced by a set of horizontal planes. Each slice is converted into a two-dimensional mask image. The mask image is then projected onto a photocurable liquid resin surface and light is projected onto the resin to cure it {{in the shape of the}} layer. Continuous liquid interface production begins with a pool of liquid photopolymer resin. Part of the pool bottom is transparent to ultraviolet light (the [...] "window"), which causes the resin to solidify. The object rises slowly enough to allow resin to flow under and maintain contact with the bottom of the object. [...] In powder-fed directed-energy deposition, a high-power laser is used to melt metal powder supplied to the focus of the laser beam.

50|$|In powder-fed directed-energy deposition, a {{high-power}} laser {{is used to}} melt {{metal powder}} supplied to {{the focus of the}} laser beam. The laser beam typically travels {{through the center of the}} deposition head and is focused to a small spot by one or more lenses. The build occurs on a X-Y table which is driven by a tool path created from a digital model to fabricate an object layer by layer. The deposition head is moved up vertically as each layer is completed. Metal powder is delivered and distributed around the circumference of the head or can be split by an internal manifold and delivered through nozzles arranged in various configurations around the deposition head. A hermetically sealed chamber filled with inert gas or a local inert shroud gas is often used to shield the melt pool from atmospheric oxygen for better control of material properties. The <b>powder</b> <b>fed</b> directed energy process is similar to Selective Laser Sintering, but the metal powder is applied only where material is being added to the part at that moment. The process supports a wide range of materials including titanium, stainless steel, aluminum, and other specialty materials as well as composites and functionally graded material. The process can not only fully build new metal parts but can also add material to existing parts for example for coatings, repair, and hybrid manufacturing applications.

40|$|There {{is concern}} that gins located in boll weevil, Anthonomus grandis grandis Boheman, {{eradication}} zones may become points of reintroduction when they process cotton grown {{in a neighboring}} infested area. We estimated boll weevil survival through two typical machine sequences used in commercial cotton gins to clean and dry the seed cotton {{in advance of the}} gin stand, as well as separately through two incline cylinder cleaners or one or two tower dryers operating at different temperatures. Large numbers of laboratory-reared adult boll weevils were marked with fluorescent <b>powder,</b> <b>fed</b> into the test system, and recovered with the assistance of blacklights. We found no evidence of survival through the seed cotton cleaning systems even when the dryers were not heated, or when passed separately through the two incline cleaners alone. Upper confidence limits (95 %) were calculated for the observed zero recoveries based on sample size and the binomial distribution, and these represent the statistical worst-case (i. e., highest) survival potential. Survival through heated tower dryers declined rapidly to zero at higher temperatures, especially when two dryers were running. Although we conclude that the potential for survival of weevils in the seed cotton to the gin stand is zero or close to zero, a small percentage of live weevils was recovered in the green boll/rock trap, which may represent the greatest threat of reintroduction at the gin. Escape of live weevils with the gin trash is also possible, and studies addressing this issue will be presented elsewhere...|$|E

We tested the hypotheses that (1) powdered A. franciscana eggs are more suitable than whole eggs; and (2) palmitic acid, a common fatty acid in natural prey, i. e., aphids, is an effective dietary supplement. Development time, pre-imaginal survival, sex ratio, and body weight of adults did not differ significantly amongst individuals <b>fed</b> <b>powdered</b> vs. whole eggs, with or without 5 % palmitic acid.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cooked bean powders are a {{promising}} novel protein and fiber source for dogs, which have demonstrated potential to alter microbial composition and function for chronic {{disease control and}} prevention. This study aimed to determine the impact of cooked navy bean <b>powder</b> <b>fed</b> as a staple food ingredient on the fecal microbiome of healthy adult pet dogs. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Fecal samples from healthy dogs prior to dietary control and after 4 wk of dietary treatment with macro- and micronutrient matched diets containing either 0 or 25 % cooked navy beans (n =  11 and n =  10, respectively) were analyzed by 454 -pyrosequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene. There were few differences between dogs fed the control and navy bean diets after 4 wk of treatment. These data indicate {{that there were no}} major effects of navy bean inclusion on microbial populations. However, significant differences due to dietary intervention onto both research diets were observed (i. e., microbial populations at baseline versus 4 wk of intervention with 0 or 25 % navy bean diets). After 4 wk of dietary intervention on either control or navy bean diet, the Phylum Firmicutes was increased and the Phyla Actinobacteria and Fusobacteria were decreased compared to baseline. CONCLUSIONS: No negative alterations of microbial populations occurred following cooked navy bean intake in dogs, indicating that bean powders may be a viable protein and fiber source for commercial pet foods. The highly variable microbial populations observed in these healthy adult pet dogs at baseline is one potential reason for the difficulty to detect alterations in microbial populations following dietary changes. Given the potential physiological benefits of bean intake in humans and dogs, further evaluation of the impacts of cooked navy bean intake on fecal microbial populations with higher power or more sensitive methods are warranted...|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} was conducted into alternative techniques for zinc and electrolyte regeneration and reuse in the refuelable zinc/air battery {{that was developed}} by LLNL and previously tested on a moving electric bus using cut wire. Mossy zinc was electrodeposited onto a bipolar array of inclined Ni plates with an energy consumption of 1. 8 kWh/kg. Using a H{sub 2 }-depolarized anode, zinc was deposited at 0. 6 V (0. 8 kA/m{sup 2 }); the open circuit voltage was 0. 45 V. Three types of fuel pellets were tested and compared with results for 0. 75 mm cut wire: spheres produced in a spouted bed (UCB); coarse powder produced by gas-atomization (Noranda); and irregular pellets produced by chopping 1 -mm plates of compacted zinc fines (Eagle-Picher, Inc.). All three types transported within the cell. The coarse <b>powder</b> <b>fed</b> continuously from hopper to cell, as did the compacted pellets ( 0. 83 mm; Eagle-Picher and UCB) failed to feed from hopper into cell, being held up in the 2. 5 mm wide channel connecting hopper to cell. Increasing channel width to {approx} 3. 5 mm should allow all three types to be used. Energy losses were determined for shorting of cells during refueling. The shorting currents between adjacent hoppers through zinc particle bridges were determined using both coarse powder and chopped compressed zinc plates. A physical model was developed allowing scaling our results for electrode polarization and bed resistance Shorting was found to consume < 0. 02 % of {{the capacity of the}} cell and to dissipate {approx} 0. 2 W/cell of heat. Corrosion rates were determined for cut wire in contact with current collector materials and battery-produced ZnO-saturated electrolyte. The rates were 1. 7 % of cell capacity per month at ambient temperatures; and 0. 08 % of capacity for 12 hours at 57 C. The total energy conversion efficiency for zinc recovery using the hydrogen was estimated at 34 % (natural gas to battery terminals) [...] comparable to fuel cells.

40|$|Ninety-one Swiss veal farms {{producing}} under a label {{with improved}} welfare standards were visited between August and December 2014 to investigate risk {{factors related to}} antimicrobial drug use and mortality. All herds consisted of own and purchased calves, with a median of 77. 4 % of purchased calves. The calves' mean age was 29 ± 15 days at purchasing and the fattening period lasted at average 120 ± 28 days. The mean carcass weight was 125 ± 12 kg. A mean of 58 ± 33 calves were fattened per farm and year, and purchased calves were bought from a mean of 20 ± 17 farms of origin. Antimicrobial drug treatment incidence was calculated with the defined daily dose methodology. The mean treatment incidence (TIADD) was 21 ± 15 daily doses per calf and year. The mean mortality risk was 4. 1 %, calves died at a mean age of 94 ± 50 days, and the main causes of death were bovine respiratory disease (BRD, 50 %) and gastro-intestinal disease (33 %). Two multivariable models were constructed, for antimicrobial drug treatment incidence (53 farms) and mortality (91 farms). No quarantine, shared air space for several groups of calves, and no clinical examination upon arrival at the farm were associated with increased antimicrobial treatment incidence. Maximum group size and weight differences > 100 kg within a group were associated with increased mortality risk, while vaccination and beef breed were associated with decreased mortality risk. The majority of antimicrobial treatments (84. 6 %) were given as group treatments with oral <b>powder</b> <b>fed</b> through an automatic milk feeding system. Combination products containing chlortetracycline with tylosin and sulfadimidine or with spiramycin were used for 54. 9 %, and amoxicillin for 43. 7 % of the oral group treatments. The main indication for individual treatment was BRD (73 %). The mean age at the time of treatment was 51 days, corresponding to an estimated weight of 80 - 100 kg. Individual treatments were mainly applied through injections (88. 5 %), and included administration of fluoroquinolones in 38. 3 %, penicillines (amoxicillin or benzylpenicillin) in 25. 6 %, macrolides in 13. 1 %, tetracyclines in 12. 0 %, 3 th and 4 th generation cephalosporines in 4. 7 %, and florfenicol in 3. 9 % of the cases. The present study allowed for identifying risk factors for increased antimicrobial drug treatment and mortality.

Two approaches have been taken: an in vivo study in which lambs were infected from three weeks of age with third-stage larval Ostertagia circumcincta and an in vitro examination of direct effects of bovine milk and some of its crude fractions on the motility of O. circumcincta larvae. The in vivo experiment was designed to compare parasite establishment in lambs either fed entirely on milk from birth, weaned on to solid feed by three weeks of age, or provided with solid feed from two weeks of age and given a milk feed once a day. To examine whether lack of rumen development was a crucial factor, each diet group consisted of lambs given normal ensheathed third-stage larvae and an equal number of lambs given exshcathed larvae. A total of 24 lambs were included in the study, in six groups each of four lambs. All lambs were infected by tube (into the oesophagus) twice a week with either 1000 exsheathed or ensheathed third-stage O. circumcincta larvae. Infection began after the week taken to establish the lambs on their new diet, so that starting on week lour of life, the lambs were trickle infected for six weeks. There were highly significantly lower worm burdens at necropsy in the two milk-fed groups of lambs than in both the other groups, but no difference between the burdens in those completely fed solid food and in lambs receiving a 600 ml milk feed once a day along with solids. Irrespective of the diet, female worms made up half the total number of worms in each lamb, with males and immature stages equally making up the other half. Faecal egg counts in the Milk groups were also very low, three of the eight lambs never providing a faecal sample in which eggs were found. Also consistent with the lower worm burdens were the thinner abomasal mucosa and lower abomasal pH, although these may also have been affected by the diet. Nodules were visible in the abomasa of all lambs in all groups. All groups had increased serum gastrin and pepsinogen levels, with considerable variation between animals within all groups. An important observation was that there was no significant difference between lambs receiving exsheathed or ensheathed larvae for any parameter measured. The immaturity of the reticulo-rumen and omasum does not appear to prevent ensheathed larvae from exsheathing and establishing in the abomasum of lambs with an underdeveloped rumen. The similar worm burdens in the milk-fed lambs given ensheathed and exsheathed larvae therefore does not support the conclusions from an earlier study in calves that lack of rumen function was the reason for lower worm burdens in non-ruminating calves. Instead, it would appear that the milk itself is reducing parasite establishment. In vitro exposure to fresh bovine milk, commercial bovine milk with either 3. 3 % or 0. 2 % fat, the milk <b>powder</b> <b>fed</b> to the lambs, whey protein, casein or ultra low heat skim milk powder all reduced the motility of exsheathed third-stage O. circumcincta larvae. The effect on motility was concentration and time dependent for all milks. The active component appears to be associated with proteins and not with the lipid fraction and may be nonspecific, as both whey and casein were effective. Different components may be responsible for inhibition of larvae by whey and casein proteins. The activity of whey protein increased as the pH increased; the whey was most active at pH 4. 5 and above, when it would be in the anion form. In contrast, there was no difference in activity at pH 5. 5 and 6. 5 for casein. The effect of time of incubation also differed for whey and casein. A possible explanation for the in vitro and in vivo effects of milk are the attachment of the proteins to the larvae. The lack of effect when milk and solid feed are ingested together may result from the protein attaching to the food particles in preference to the larvae or, alternatively, the milk may have left the abomasum before the larvae were administered. This suggests that practical applications for milk proteins as anti-parasite agents may be limited in ruminants consuming solid feed...|$|E

30|$|There is {{a dearth}} of {{literature}} available concerning the beneficial effects of garlic or onion on egg quality. For example, Yalcin et al. (2006) noticed that egg weight increased when laying hens were fed 5 and 10 [*]g/kg garlic powder. Also, Khan et al. (2007) noted that egg production increased during the 6  weeks in which 0, 2, 6, or 8 % garlic <b>powder</b> was <b>fed</b> to laying hens. On the other hand, Canogullari et al. (2010) reported that egg production increased significantly by adding 1 % garlic powder in the feed of laying hen. Meanwhile, Reddy et al. (1991) and Chowdhury et al. (2002) noted that the supplementation of garlic powder did not affect egg production.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two common}} types of {{large-scale}} pellet mills: flat die mills and ring die mills. Flat die mills use a flat die with slots. The powder is {{introduced to the}} top of the die and as the die rotates a roller presses the powder through the holes in the die. A cutter on the other side of the die cuts the exposed pellet free from the die. In the ring die there are radial slot throughout the die. <b>Powder</b> is <b>fed</b> into the inside of the die and spreaders evenly distribute the powder. Two rollers then compress the powder through the die holes. Two cutters are used to cut the pellets free from the outside of the die.|$|R

Advantages include improved flowability, increased powder packing density, elimination of internal component cavities and fractures, changes in morphology resulting in decreased friction between particles and contamination during pneumatic transport and enhanced particle purity. In this empirical study, spherical iron particles were produced using a microwave plasma operating at atmospheric pressure and characterized using optical microscopy and SEM techniques.

For this purpose, PMMA/ATH <b>powder</b> was <b>fed</b> to a plasma jet where the process and carrier gas was compressed air. The deposited coatings were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and water contact angle measurements. Further, the raw material was characterised before deposition.

40|$|Liquid tin-lead alloy, liquid bismuth, {{and liquid}} tin-lead-bismuth alloy were {{investigated}} as potential anodes for a solid oxide fuel cell powered directly by coal. Power generation from direct oxidation of solid coal was demonstrated {{with a good}} stability only in the case when liquid tin-lead anode was used. The tests were carried out at 900 °C under ambient pressure. The open circuit potentials of the SOFC with tin-lead and bismuth anodes operated under nitrogen were compared, and those values were found to correspond to the metal-metal oxide redox potentials for tin and bismuth, respectively. When the SOFCs were fueled by hydrogen, only the tin-lead anode showed a direct electrochemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen.
