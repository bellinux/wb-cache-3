5|$|On June 15, 1928, Horch {{arranged}} for the American Bond and Mortgage Company to underwrite a bond of $1,925,000 to cover costs. The bonds, which were linked {{to the price of}} gold, were certificates held under a trust mortgage with the Chatham Phenix National Bank and Trust Company. Prospective purchasers of the bonds were told that Horch and an associate guaranteed payment of <b>principal</b> <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> personally and that the income from rentals was expected far to exceed expenses, including both interest costs and amounts to be committed to the sinking fund.|$|E

25|$|In summer 1960, the Chesapeake Bay Ferry Commission sold $200 {{million in}} toll revenue bonds to private investors, and the {{proceeds}} {{were used to}} finance {{the construction of the}} bridge–tunnel.

By law the timeframe used is 75 years though the Medicare actuaries also give an infinite-horizon estimate because life expectancy consistently increases and other economic factors underlying the estimates change.|$|E
25|$|Fannie Mae also earns a {{significant}} portion of its income from guaranty fees it receives as compensation for assuming the credit risk on mortgage loans underlying its single-family Fannie Mae MBS and on the single-family mortgage loans held in its retained portfolio. Investors, or purchasers of Fannie Mae MBSs, are willing to let Fannie Mae keep this fee in exchange for assuming the credit risk; that is, Fannie Mae's guarantee that the scheduled <b>principal</b> <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> on the underlying loan will be paid even if the borrower defaults.|$|E

25|$|Securitization is the {{financial}} practice of pooling {{various types of}} contractual debt such as residential mortgages, commercial mortgages, auto loans or credit card debt obligations (or other non-debt assets which generate receivables) and selling their related cash flows to third party investors as securities, which may be described as bonds, pass-through securities, or collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). Investors are repaid from the <b>principal</b> <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> cash flows collected from the underlying debt and redistributed through the capital structure of the new financing. Securities backed by mortgage receivables are called mortgage-backed securities (MBS), while those backed by other types of receivables are asset-backed securities (ABS).|$|E
25|$|Financial {{conglomerates}} became major {{beneficiaries of}} the liberalized economy and the flood of foreign bank loans. Large foreign banks reinstated the credit cycle, as the Junta saw that the basic state obligations, such as resuming payment of <b>principal</b> <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> installments, were honored. International lending {{organizations such as the}} World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the Inter-American Development Bank lent vast sums anew. Many foreign multinational corporations such as International Telephone and Telegraph (ITT), Dow Chemical, and Firestone, all expropriated by Allende, returned to Chile. Pinochet's policies eventually led to substantial GDP growth, in contrast to the negative growth seen {{in the early years of}} his administration. Foreign debt also grew substantially under Pinochet, rising 300% between 1974 and 1988.|$|E
500|$|Program {{income is}} {{sometimes}} directly {{generated by the}} federally funded program. This type of income includes, but is not limited to, income from fees for services performed, the use or rental of property acquired with program funds, the sale of items fabricated under the program, and payments of <b>principal</b> <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> on loans made by the recipient to others with program funds. However, it generally does not include interest on program funds (which is covered under “Cash Management”, see above); nor does it cover [...] rebates, credits, discounts, and refunds (covered under “Allowable Costs/Cost Principles”); nor proceeds {{from the sale of}} equipment or real property (covered under “Equipment and Real Property Management”). The uses or treatment of program income are either deducted by the federal agency from the current program budget (e.g., the program income substitutes part of the original budget), added to the current program budget, or used to meet matching requirements.|$|E

The Age also focused on the Dandenong Education Precinct Project in a special education edition of the newspaper. On 10 September 2009, Dandenong High School appeared on the TV news show, The 7.30 Report, on ABC. In September 2009, the then Minister for Education Bronwyn Pike visited the school and officially opened Stage 1 of the project, presenting the school with a plaque. In September 2010, the Governor-General of Australia, Quentin Bryce, visited the school.|$|R

On interest constellation, the article makes a case that protectionist forces have been strengthened relative to liberal forces. This slight protectionist turn is mostly witnessed in the area of anti-dumping and with respect to the Doha trade round. On preference aggregation, guided by a principal–agent framework, it is argued that the {{growth in the number of}} actors (<b>principals</b> <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> groups) has not constrained the role of the European Commission (agent). However, it has led to an increase in informal processes and has empowered large trading nations vis-a`-vis smaller and less ‘comitology-experienced’ member states...|$|R
2500|$|U.S. {{mortgages}} use an amortizing loan, not compound interest. With these loans, an amortization {{schedule is}} used {{to determine how to}} apply payments toward <b>principal</b> <b>and</b> <b>interest.</b> [...] Interest generated on these loans is not added to the principal, but rather is paid off monthly as the payments are applied.|$|E
2500|$|Fannie Mae {{received}} no direct government funding or backing; Fannie Mae securities carried no actual explicit government guarantee of being repaid. This was clearly {{stated in the}} law that authorizes GSEs, on the securities themselves, and in many public communications issued by Fannie Mae. Neither the certificates nor payments of <b>principal</b> <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> on the certificates were explicitly guaranteed by the United States government. The certificates did not legally constitute a debt or obligation of the United States or any of its agencies or instrumentalities other than Fannie Mae. During the sub-prime era, every Fannie Mae prospectus read in bold, all-caps letters: [...] "The certificates and payments of <b>principal</b> <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> on the certificates are not guaranteed by the United States, and do not constitute a debt or obligation of the United States or any of its agencies or instrumentalities other than Fannie Mae." [...] (Verbiage changed from all-caps to standard case for readability).|$|E
2500|$|If the {{underlying}} assets are mortgages or loans, there are usually two separate [...] "waterfalls" [...] because the <b>principal</b> <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> receipts can be easily allocated and matched. But if the assets are income-based transactions such as rental deals one cannot categorise the revenue so easily between income and principal repayment. In this case all the revenue is used to pay the cash flows due on the bonds as those cash flows become due.|$|E

2500|$|The monthly {{payments}} from {{the underlying assets}} – loans or receivables – typically consist of <b>principal</b> <b>and</b> <b>interest,</b> with principal being scheduled or unscheduled. The cash flows produced by the underlying assets can be allocated to investors in different ways. Cash flows can be directly passed through to investors after administrative fees are subtracted, thus creating a “pass-through” security; alternatively, cash flows can be carved up according to specified rules and market demand, thus creating [...] "structured" [...] securities." ...|$|E
2500|$|Grantor trusts are {{typically}} used in automobile-backed securities and REMICs (Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduits). [...] Grantor trusts {{are very similar}} to pass-through trusts used in the earlier days of securitization. An originator pools together loans and sells them to a grantor trust, which issues classes of securities backed by these loans. [...] <b>Principal</b> <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> received on the loans, after expenses are taken into account, are passed through to the holders of the securities on a pro-rata basis.|$|E
2500|$|Securities {{backed by}} credit card {{receivables}} have been benchmark for the ABS market since they were first introduced in 1987. [...] Credit card holders may borrow funds on a revolving basis up to an assigned credit limit. [...] The borrowers then pay <b>principal</b> <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> as desired, along with the required minimum monthly payments. [...] Because principal repayment is not scheduled, credit card debt {{does not have an}} actual maturity date and is considered a nonamortizing loan.|$|E
