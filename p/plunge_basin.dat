The Bishri block is a broad northeast <b>plunging</b> inverted <b>basin</b> located at the northeast portion of the Palmyride mountain belt where the mountains intersect the Euphrates fault system. Well and seismic data show that subsidence and sedimentation in the Bishri area was generally continuous from Carboniferous to Palaeocene time, with the Bishri block part of the extensive Palmyride / Sinjar trough. Major bounding faults and a rift-type environment are documented in the Permo-Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous. The present Bishri structural and topographic high has been formed through transpressive structural inversion since the Middle Miocene; high-angle Mesozoic bounding normal faults now have net reverse offsets with a significant dextral strike-slip component. East of the Bishri block, towards the Euphrates fault system, north-northwest - south-southeast striking normal faults exhibit less reverse movement.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} a laboratory set of experiments made to investigate the pressure fluctuation field on beneath of a plunge pool subjected to jet impingement. As an example this phenomenon takes commonly place {{in the case of the}} drop structure, where the elevation reduces with a take off and impinging portion. When the downstream bottom is nearly horizontal and made of concrete or rock, there is no significant scour, and the drop is followed by a stilling basin where the hydraulic jump takes place. The relevance of the topic is related to the structural design of the linings of the dissipation basin downstream barrages or check dams. Nevertheless the knowledge of the stresses at the basis of <b>plunge</b> pool dissipation <b>basins</b> can be useful to predict a localized erosion process. With reference to the specific case of the prototype of a dam spillway and downstream energy dissipation basin, we discuss the effect of a variable water cushion depth on the reduction of the severe pressure fluctuations that take place at the bottom of the stilling basin. The experiments are made on a 1 : 40 laboratory model, recording the dynamic behavior of pressure fluctuations in a set of different positions on beneath the plunge pool. The experimental results presented in dimensionless form, give a better understanding of the fluctuating pressure reduction that can be obtained increasing the cushion depth...|$|R
25|$|Jameson’s {{research}} {{showed that}} the kinetics of flotation of fine particles was a strong function of the bubble diameter and {{that the way to}} improve recoveries was to use small bubbles in the order of 300µm in diameter. What was needed was a practical method of making such bubbles in large quantities, of the order of billions per second. The device needed to be simple to construct and operate, capable of running for long periods with minimal maintenance, and should be resistant to blockage by stray large particles in the feed. He began to look at the theory of bubble breakup in sheared flows, that is, in flow fields in which layers of liquid slide over each other. Lewis and Davidson had recently published a theory to predict the maximum size of bubbles in a well-characterised flow environment. By balancing the forces acting on a bubble in a shearing flow, including the disruptive dynamic stresses from the liquid motion and the restoring force of surface tension, it was possible to predict the critical shear rate required to produce a bubble of given size. Jameson then looked for simple and practical ways of generating the required shear rates, and found inspiration in the kitchen sink. If a jet of water from a tap <b>plunges</b> into a <b>basin</b> full of water, a shear layer develops around the jet, that entrains air from the atmosphere into the water, and at the same time, breaks up the entrained air into fine bubbles. The effect is magnified if there is a detergent in the water. Detergents, known as frothers, are used in flotation to prevent bubble coalescence, and to create stable froths. By the correct choice of jet velocity and diameter, it is possible to provide a controlled shear environment that can generate bubbles of a suitable size for flotation, with the added advantage that the air is naturally aspirated by the jet, so {{there is no need for}} a compressor or blower. Thus the idea of the Jameson Cell was born.|$|R
60|$|The {{next morning}} I was {{up with the}} {{appearance}} of the dawn, and, having suffered much from the heat the preceding day, I walked to a suitable spot, threw off my clothes, and <b>plunged</b> into the <b>basin.</b> The water was transparent almost as air; and I happened to select a place where the coral grew within a few yards of the surface. As I dove, my eye fell on a considerable cluster of large oysters that were collected on the rock, and, reaching them, I succeeded in bringing up half a dozen that clung to each other. These dives I repeated, during the next quarter of an hour, until I had all the oysters, sixty or eighty in number, safe on the shore. That they were the pearl oysters, I knew immediately; and beckoning to Neb, the fellow soon had them snug in a basket, and put away in a place of security. The circumstance was mentioned to Marble, who, finding no more heavy drags to be made, ordered the Sandwich Islanders to take a boat and pass a few hours in their regular occupation, on account of the owners--if, indeed, the last had any further claim on our services. These men met with tolerable success, though, relatively, nothing equal to mine. What, just then, was of far more importance, they made a discovery of an arm-chest lying {{on the bottom of the}} basin, at the anchorage of the Crisis, and which had doubtless been sunk there by the French. We had all la Pauline's boats but the captain's gig. I went in one of them with a gang of hands, and, the divers securing a rope to the handles of the chest, we soon got it in. It turned out to be one of the arm-chests of the Crisis, which the French had found in their way and thrown overboard, evidently preferring to use weapons to which they were accustomed. They had done better by carrying the chest out to sea, and disposing of it in fifty or a hundred fathom water.|$|R
60|$|The water looked deliciously cool. An audacious thought struck him. He was alone, and {{the place}} was a secluded one. He knew {{there were no other}} visitors; the marble basin was quite hidden {{from the rest of the}} garden, and {{approached}} only from the path by which he had come, and whose entire view he commanded. He quietly and deliberately undressed himself under the willows, and unhesitatingly <b>plunged</b> into the <b>basin.</b> The water was four or five feet deep, and its extreme length afforded an excellent swimming bath, despite the water-lilies and a few aquatic plants that mottled its clear surface, or the sedge that clung to the bases of the statues. He disported for some moments in the delicious element, and then seated himself upon one of the half-submerged plinths, almost hidden by reeds, that had once upheld a river god. Here, lazily resting himself upon his elbow, half his body still below the water, his quick ear was suddenly startled by a rustling noise and the sound of footsteps. For a moment he was inclined to doubt his senses; he could see only the empty path before him and the deserted terrace. But the sound became more distinct, and to his great uneasiness appeared to come from the OTHER side of the fringe of willows, where there was undoubtedly a path to the fountain which he had overlooked. His clothes were under those willows, but he was at least twenty yards from the bank and an equal distance from the terrace. He was about to slip beneath the water when, to his crowning horror, before he could do so, a young girl slowly appeared from the hidden willow path full upon the terrace. She was walking leisurely with a parasol over her head and a book in her hand. Even in his intense consternation her whole figure--a charming one in its white dress, sailor hat, and tan shoes--was imprinted on his memory as she instinctively halted to look upon the fountain, evidently an unexpected surprise to her.|$|R

60|$|Waally {{made his}} first push for the bridge, expecting to find it unguarded, and hoping to cross it unresisted. He knew that the ship was gone, and no longer dreaded her fire; but he was fully aware that the Summit had its guns, and he wished to seize them while his men were still impelled by the ardour of a first onset. Those {{formidable}} engines of war were held in the most profound respect by all his people, and Waally knew the importance of success in a rapid movement. He had gleaned so much information concerning {{the state of the}} Reef, that he expected no great resistance, fully believing that, now he had seized the Mermaid, his enemies would be reduced in numbers to less than half-a-dozen. In all this, he was right enough; and there can be no question that Socrates and his whole party, together with the Reef, and for that matter, the entire group, would have fallen into his hands, but for the timely arrival of the reinforcement. The yell arose when it was ascertained that the bridge was drawn in, and it was succeeded by a volley from the guard posted near it, on the Reef. This commenced the strife, which immediately raged with great fury, and with prodigious clamour. Waally had all his muskets fired, too, though as yet he saw no enemy, and did not know in what direction to aim, He could see men moving about on the Reef, it is true, but it was only at moments, as they mostly kept themselves behind the covers. After firing his muskets, the chief issued an order for a charge, and several hundreds of his warriors <b>plunged</b> into the <b>basin,</b> and began to swim towards the point to be assailed. This movement admonished Betts of the prudence of retiring towards the gate, which he did in good order, and somewhat deliberately. This time, Waally actually got his men upon the Reef without a panic and without loss. They landed in a crowd, and were soon rushing in all directions, eager for plunder, and thirsting for blood. Betts was enabled, notwithstanding to enter the gate, which he did without delay, perfectly satisfied that all efforts of his to resist the torrent without must be vain. As soon as his party had entered, the gate was closed, and Betts was at liberty to bestow all his care on the defence of the crater.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an impulse framework for analyzing the hydrodynamic forces on bodies in flow. This general theoretical framework is widely applicable, {{and it is}} used to address the hydrodynamics of fish propulsion, water entry of spheres, and the offdesign performance of marine propellers. These seemingly-unrelated physics problems share a key common thread: The forces on these fish, spheres, and propellers can be modeled as the sum of the reaction to the rate of change of (1) the pressure impulse required to set up the potential flow about the body, and (2) the vortex impulse required to create the vortical structures {{in the wake of the}} body. Fish generate propulsive forces by creating and manipulating large-scale vortical structures using their body and tail. High-speed particle image velocimetry experiments show that a fish generates two vortex rings during a C-turn maneuver and that the change in momentum of the fish balances the change in pressure impulse plus the vortex impulse of these rings. When a sphere <b>plunges</b> into a <b>basin</b> of water and creates a sub-surface air cavity in place of a vortical wake, the vortex impulse is zero, and the force on the sphere is given by the pressure impulse component. Using data from high-speed imaging experiments, a semi-empirical numerical simulation is developed herein; this numerical model shows how the presence of the cavity alters the unsteady pressure force on the sphere and modulates the dynamics of the impact event. During steady propeller operation, the pressure impulse is constant, and the loads on the propeller are given by the vortex impulse component. To analyze these loads, a computational design and analysis tool is presented; this code suite is based on propeller lifting line theory, which is shown to be a special case of the general impulse framework of this thesis. A marine propeller is designed, built, and tested over a range of off-design operating conditions. Experimental results match the predicted performance curve for this propeller, which provides important validation data for the numerical method presented herein. 3 Bringing this thesis full circle, the unsteady startup of the propellor is addressed, which is analogous to the impulsive maneuvering of the swimming fish. As in the fish maneuvering problem, the propellor generates a ring-like vortical wake, and it is shown herein how the vortex impulse of these rings provides thrust for the propellor. With the perspective of the impulse framework developed in this thesis, the results of these tandem experimental investigations and numerical simulations provide deeper insight into classical fluid-dynamics theory and modern experimental hydrodynamics. by Brenden P.
