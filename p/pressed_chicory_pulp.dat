40|$|Abstract: Soluble fibre (SF) is an {{important}} nutrient to enhance fermentative activity and gut health in rabbits. The main source of SF in rabbit diets is sugar beet pulp (SBP), whereas, due to its high content of SF (34 %), dried <b>chicory</b> <b>pulp</b> (ChP) could be an alternative to SBP. In a fattening trial with 192  hybrid weanlings 32  d old weighing 837 ± 45  g, <b>chicory</b> <b>pulp</b> was used in replacement of SBP to study effects on production performances and slaughter characteristics. Rabbits were fed one of 4  iso-energetic (9. 65  MJ digestible energy/kg) and iso-nitrogenous (15. 6 % crude protein) diets: a negative control (NC) diet with a low dietary SF content (7. 3 %), a positive control diet with quite a high SBP level (13. 5 %) and SF content (10. 6 %) and 2  diets with respectively 10 % and 20 % of <b>chicory</b> <b>pulp</b> (ChP 10 : 9. 9 % SF and ChP 20 : 13. 7 % SF). The SF content was measured as the difference between total dietary fibre and neutral detergent fibre, the latter corrected for ash and protein content. Each dietary treatment consisted of 12  replicates of 4  rabbits. Weight gain was high (on av. 54  g/d) and comparable for the NC, SBP and ChP diets. However, feed conversion ratio was improved (P< 0. 05) with the ChP 20  diet compared to the NC diet (2. 88  vs. 2. 97). Mortality was low and not influenced by the dietary treatment. Slaughter data were very similar and no effect of the SF level on caecal weight or slaughter yield was observed. It was concluded that <b>chicory</b> <b>pulp</b> is a good alternative soluble fibre source in balanced diets for rabbits {{and can be used}} at least up to 20 % inclusion rate.

40|$|An {{in vitro}} {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the differences in microbial activity of five faecal inocula from weaned pigs and one faecal inoculum from unweaned pigs in combination with 6 substrates. The substrates tested were negative control diet, corn, soybean meal, oligofructose (OF), ground chicory roots and a mixture (60 % <b>chicory</b> <b>pulp</b> and 40 % OF). The inocula used were derived from pigs fed either a corn-soy based diet without antibiotics (NCON), the NCON diet supplemented with oligofructose (OF), a mixture of <b>chicory</b> <b>pulp</b> (40 %) and OF (60 %) (MIX), ground chicory roots (CHR) or the NCON diet supplemented with antibiotics (PCON). The cumulative gas production measured fermentation kinetics and end products, such as total gas production, ammonia and volatile fatty acids, were also determined. Both the substrate and the inoculum significantly affected the fermentation characteristics. The cumulative gas production curve showed that different substrates caused more differences in traits of fermentation kinetics than the different inocula. Inocula of weaned pigs gave a significantly higher VFA production compared to the inoculum from unweaned animals, whilst the rate of fermentation and the total gas produced did not differ. OF showed the highest fermentation kinetics and the lowest NH 3, pH and OM loss compared to other substrates. It was concluded that the microbial activity was significantly affected by substrate and inoculum. Inoculum from weaned pigs had more potential for microbial fermentation of the carbohydrate ingredients and oligofructose than that of unweaned pigs.

40|$|The present paper {{presents}} the results and conclusions of 7 trials made in healthy (6 studies) and obese (1 study) dogs to experiment the effects of dietary fibre on faeces characteristics, nutrients digestibility, water consumption and plasma metabolites. Several incorporation rates of different fibre sources (cellulose, guar gum, inulin, fructooligosaccharides (FOS), pectins, beet fibre, beet <b>pulp</b> and <b>chicory</b> <b>pulp)</b> were studied. Furthermore, a blend of cellulose and guar gum was formulated to imitate the ratio of soluble-to-insoluble fibre of beet fibre to study {{the influence of the}} fibre solubility. Drinking water consumption was increased by beet fibre and inulin in the diet. With the exception of cellulose for dry matter (DM) concentration, the different fibres induced similar effects on faeces: increased daily excretion, decreased DM concentration and increased excretion of DM. Nutrient digestibility coefficients were diversely affected by fibre consumption and, excepted for the ether extract, decreased in nutrients digestibility were in relation with added total or insoluble fibre in the diet. Important metabolic effects were observed but were not in relation with the solubility of the fibre. Decreased pre- and/or postprandial plasmatic concentrations of glucose (with FOS), insulin (with guar gum), urea, cholesterol (with guar gum) and triglycerides (with FOS) suggest that most of the studied fibres should be used as an aid for dogs suffering from obesity, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipaemia, chronic renal insufficiency or constipation.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} different experimental gnawing blocks as cage enrichment in rabbits. One hundred and five pregnant rabbit does housed in conventional wire cages were distributed according to their parity number in 4 homogenous treatment groups. Throughout one complete reproductive cycle (from day 18 of pregnancy till weaning of the litter), does either received no enrichment (controls) or a gnawing block hung from a wire on the cage wall. The 3 different blocks had the same basal components (wheat, molasses and oligoelements), but additionally wood mash (WM), wood mash+chicory pulp (ChP) or wood mash and inulin syrup (I) were respectively incorporated. After weaning, each litter continued to receive the same blocks as before and block consumption was measured as well as the performance of the fatteners. Weight development during the lactation was comparable except in does that received the wood powder blocks. These females had a significantly lower weight (P< 0. 05) at different time points compared to controls. Litter weight or kit weight was not significantly different at any of the time points measured, but again the treatment with wood powder blocks presented the lowest weight. The consumption of blocks during the whole reproduction cycle (42 d) was 11. 0 ± 1. 1; 6. 8 ± 1. 0 and 4. 4 ± 0. 7 g/d per cage for wood mash, <b>chicory</b> <b>pulp</b> or inulin enriched blocks, respectively. A very high variability in consumption of blocks was observed between females. This varied between 1 and 5 (I or ChP group) or even 1 and 9 blocks (WM group) per reproductive cycle. In fatteners, daily block consumption was significantly different (P< 0. 05) and reached on average 7. 0 ± 0. 5; 3. 9 ± 0. 5 and 2. 2 ± 0. 2 g/d per fattener, respectively for WM, ChP and I. Five females with a block and 5 females without a block were observed for 1 h 3 d before the expected parturition and at 2 time points during lactation. Distinction was made between 15 different behaviours. Although the presence of a block did not significantly increase the total number of behavioural transitions, locomotion and intake behaviour were significantly (P< 0. 05) increased when a gnawing block was available. The observation period influenced the frequency of many behavioural transitions and before parturition was significantly higher than post parturition, respectively 56. 1 ± 11. 1 vs. 13. 7 ± 3. 8 (Week 1, P< 0. 01) and 25. 1 ± 5. 5 (Week 2, P< 0. 01). However, a very large variability was observed between does and, moreover, some does were mostly inactive after parturition during the observation period. Based on the consumption pattern and behaviour, these gnawing blocks could be considered as cage enrichment and those with the <b>chicory</b> <b>pulp</b> best fulfilled the objective of a suitable gnawing material...|$|R
40|$|An {{in vitro}} {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} assess the microbial activity of faeces from unweaned and weaned piglets. Diets of weaned piglets were supplemented with various fructans. Weaned piglets received a corn¿soy based basal diet supplemented with either corn starch (control; CON), oligofructose (OF), chicory root (CHR), a mixture of <b>chicory</b> <b>pulp</b> and oligofructose (MIX; 60 : 40) or corn starch and antibiotic (CONAB). Faecal inocula collected from unweaned (5 kg body weight (BW)) and weaned piglets (15 kg BW) were introduced in airtight 100 -mL bottles containing 0. 5 g of substrate (basal or mix) in pre-warmed buffered medium. The organic matter cumulative volume (OMCV) was measured for 48 h, and a mono-phasic model was fitted to the data. The concentration of volatile fatty acids (VFA) and ammonia (NH 3) was determined after fermentation. Incubation of substrate mix with the different inocula gave a significant higher OMCV compared to substrate basal, except for the inoculum from piglets of the CONAB group. In addition, substrate mix gave a higher Rmax and a lower Tmax compared to substrate basal. With the exception of inoculum obtained from chicory root supplemented animals (CHR) no substrate effects were observed in fermentation end-products (VFA and NH 3). However, the proportions of acetic acid were significantly higher and those of butyric acid lower when inocula were incubated with substrate mix. Inocula from weaned pigs tended to show higher proportions of propionic acid when incubated with substrate mix, whilst inocula from unweaned piglets showed the opposite. The differences in fermentation kinetics between substrates after incubation with inocula from weaned and unweaned piglets in combination with an altered composition in VFA, points to a modified faecal microflora following weaning...|$|R
40|$|Cell wall polysaccharides (CWPs) from <b>chicory</b> root <b>pulp</b> (CRP) and {{the effect}} of {{ensiling}} on CWP structure to reduce the water-holding capacity (WHC) were studied. Sequential extractions of CRP showed that hot water extraction solubilized arabinan-rich pectin and inulin, each representing 6 % of all CRP sugars. A significant amount of pectic sugars (46 %) rich in uronic acid from CRP was solubilized by chelating agents. Both dilute alkali extraction, which solubilized branched pectin (14 % from CRP), and concentrated alkali extraction, which solubilized hemicellulose dominant in yloglucans (2. 5 %) mostly of the XXXG type and mannan (0. 9 %), from CRP CWPs seemed to influence the WHC of CRP. Alkali-insoluble residue (39 % of CRP sugars) mainly comprised cellulose and some branched pectin (17 % from CRP). Ensiling reduced the methyl esterification of pectin, caused degradation of homogalacturonan and rhamnogalacturonan, and possibly modified the xyloglucan, mannan, and glucan network, reducing the WHC from 6 mL/g to 3. 4 mL/g...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to study the in vitro fermentation of <b>chicory</b> root <b>pulp</b> (CRP) and ensiled CRP (ECRP) using human fecal inoculum. Analysis of carbohydrate levels in fermentation digests showed that 51 % of all CRP carbohydrates were utilized after 24 h of fermentation. For ECRP, having the same cell wall polysaccharide composition as CRP, but with solubilization of 4 times more of CRP pectin due to ensiling, the fermentation was quicker than with CRP as 11 % more carbohydrates were utilized within the first 12 h. The level of fiber utilization for ECRP after 24 h was increased by 8 % compared to CRP. This effect on fiber utilization from ECRP seemed to arise from (i) increased levels of soluble pectin fibers (arabinan, homogalacturonan, and galactan) and (ii) ahypothesized more open structure of the remaining cell walls in ECRP, which was more accessible to degradation than the CRP cell wall network. © 2014 American Chemical Society...|$|R
40|$|Research was {{conducted}} to understand cell wall polysaccharide (CWPs) degradation in <b>chicory</b> root <b>pulp</b> (CRP) during an in vitro fermentation by human faecal microbiota. Enzyme extracts (EEs) from CRP fermentation liquids (2, 12 and 24 h) were tested for enzyme activities towards p-nitrophenyl-glycosides and polysaccharides. The EEs were also incubated for 24 h on polysaccharides and cell wall residues (CWRs) derived from CRP, to determine the mechanism and efficiency of enzyme action. The study showed {{that the presence of}} arabinofuranosidase, ß-galactosidase, endo-arabinanase, endo-galactanase and exo-polygalacturonase increased for the 24 h EE, whereas the activity of enzymes degrading (hemi) cellulose was highest in the 12 h EE. It was hypothesised that increased levels of arabinofuranosidase, ß-galactosidase, endo-arabinanase, endo-galactanase, exo-polygalacturonase, pectin de-esterifying enzymes and endo-polygalacturonase contributed to a synergy in degrading pectin in CRP from 12 to 24 h of fermentation. The higher degradability of arabinan compared to galactan in the network is due to the architecture in CRP involving more accessible arabinan than galactan...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to monitor cell wall {{polysaccharide}} (CWPs) utilization during fermentation by the human colonic microbiota in the TNO in vitro model of the colon (TIM- 2). <b>Chicory</b> root <b>pulp</b> (CRP) and treated (ensiled) CRP (ECRP) containing four times more soluble pectin than CRP, were fermented in the model. After the adaptation phase of the human fecal inoculum to CRP and ECRP for 48 h, both materials were fermented quite rapidly (57 % carbohydrate utilization in 2 h). ECRP carbohydrates (85 %) were less fermented in 24 h compared to CRP carbohydrates (92 %). It was hypothesized that soluble fibers that are readily fermentable and dominantly present in ECRP programmed the microbiota in TIM- 2 to fully adapt to these soluble fibers which was not able to change towards the fermentation of insoluble fibers anymore. Consequently, ECRP insoluble fibers were less utilized than CRP insoluble fibers in TIM- 2 leading to an overall lower fiber utilization and SCFA production. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
