"Come in, please," [...] said Tourmaline, {{opening the}} door for them, and when they had entered, she placed a <b>pinkwood</b> bench for them to sit upon {{and went back to}} her throne, which was a common rocking chair. At her right were seated six {{men and women of the}} Sunrise Tribe, and on her left six men and women of the Sunset Tribe, among the latter being Coralie. The {{contrast}} between the plain, simple dress of the Queen and the gorgeous apparel of her Counselors was quite remarkable, yet her beauty far surpassed that of any of her people, and her demeanor was so modest and unassuming that it was difficult for the prisoners to believe that her word would decree life or death and that all the others were subservient to her. Tourmaline's eyes were so deep a shade of pink that they were almost hazel, and her hair was darker than that of the others, being a golden-red in color. These points, taken with her light-pink skin and slender form, rendered her distinctive among the Pinkies, whatever gown she might wear.|$|E
50|$|Eucryphia moorei, {{commonly}} known as <b>pinkwood,</b> plumwood, or eastern leatherwood is a tree found in southeastern New South Wales, Australia. It also occurs just over the border at the Howe Range in Victoria. <b>Pinkwood</b> is the dominant tree species of cool-temperate rainforests of southeastern NSW. Young plants often grow as hemiepiphytes.|$|E

5000|$|B. viscosa is a {{pyramidal}} shrub {{growing to}} 3 - 4 m tall rarely a small tree to 9 m tall. Leaves are spirally arranged, oblong to oblanceolate from 2-5 cm long by 5-15 mm wide tapering towards the petiole with flat or with slightly recurved margins. The upper leaf surface is glabrous and often viscid were by the lower surface is somewhat lighter. Male flowers are cream-yellow and clustered {{in groups of}} 2 or 3 with 4 mm long sepals and numerous short stamens. Female flowers lack petals and are solitary with 2-3 mm long sepals, roughly globose ovary and large sessile stigma. Fruit capsules are glabrous or sparsely pubescent with a viscid coating {{similar to that of}} the leaves and range from 6-8 mm long with a 2 mm wide persistent stigma. [...] Fruit capsule contains up to 3 smooth, oblong seeds which usually germinate within 5-7 days of planting. [...] <b>Pinkwoods</b> are dioecious, with separate sexes, some shrubs being female and others being male. Plants flower from December to February through the peak of summer. As the common name implies, the timber of B. viscosa bears a pink hue similar to that of Nothofagus cunninghamii but the general small scale of the plant renders it unviable as a timber tree. The plant responds well to being pruned where is can be maintained as a hedge.|$|R

50|$|Mysticarion porrectus, {{also known}} as Helicarion porrectus, is a tree-dwelling snail in the family Helicarionidae. It is endemic to Australia. This species occurs in and near rainforests at high {{altitude}} in eastern Australia. It is associated with Gondwana cool temperate rainforests, with trees such as Antarctic Beech, Sassafras and <b>Pinkwood.</b>|$|E
50|$|Common {{eucalyptus}} species include black ash, monkey gum, messmate {{and white}} ash. More rare species include the Jilliga ash and Mongamulla mallee. High altitude rainforests occur in gullies protected from fire. They {{are dominated by}} the <b>pinkwood,</b> hard water fern and soft tree fern. Other habitats include swamps, bogs, riverside forest, and rocky scrub.|$|E
50|$|The {{rainforest}} is categorised as warm temperate rainforest, (not cool temperate), {{with the}} canopy dominated by trees such as Golden Sassafras, Coachwood, Lilly Pilly, Native Daphne, Possumwood, Beefwood, Featherwood and Blackwood. Genuine cool temperate rainforest trees such as <b>Pinkwood</b> and Black Olive Berry are either absent or inconspicuous. A common tree species is the Brown Beech, {{usually associated with}} tropical or sub-tropical rainforests.|$|E
50|$|Syzygium smithii {{is found}} in {{rainforest}} from the Windsor Tableland in north-east Queensland south through New South Wales and Victoria to Wilsons Promontory.Associated trees species include bangalow palm (Archontophoenix cunninghamiana),ironwood (Backhousia myrtifolia), black wattle (Callicoma serratifolia), sassafras, (Doryphora sassafras), blueberry ash (Elaeocarpus reticulatus), <b>pinkwood</b> (Eucryphia moorei), sweet pittosporum (Pittosporum undulatum) and kanuka (Tristaniopsis laurina). Stunted coastal plants are often associated with coast banksia (Banksia integrifolia).|$|E
50|$|The undulating plateaux {{and steep}} gullies provide {{a variety of}} {{different}} habitats. <b>Pinkwood</b> rainforests occur in the sheltered fire free gullies. Black Ash, Monkey Gum, Messmate, White Ash and Snow Gums occur at higher altitudes. Yellow Box, Manna Gum and Forest Red Gum forests are found at lower altitudes. Other habitats include bogs, dry exposed eucalyptus woodland, riverside forest, swamps and heaths. Rare plants occurring in Wadbilliga National Park include the Deua Gum and the small shrub, Kunzea sp. Wadbilliga.|$|E
50|$|This plant {{may be seen}} between Fitzroy Falls in the north, and Monga National Park to the south. Its {{habitat is}} {{on the margins of}} {{temperate}} rainforest or in wet eucalypt forest, where it may be found along creeks or on mountain slopes, at an altitude of 540 to 760 m. It grows on sandy soils of alluvial origin. It is often associated with such trees as brown barrel (Eucalyptus fastigata), silvertop ash (E. sieberi), broad-leaved peppermint (E. dives), Sydney peppermint (E. piperita), and the understorey plants <b>pinkwood</b> (Eucryphia moorei), soft tree fern (Dicksonia antarctica), coral fern (Gleichenia), mountain devil (Lambertia formosa) and hairpin banksia (Banksia spinulosa). The annual rainfall where it grows is 1000 - 1100 mm.|$|E

50|$|Warm-temperate {{rainforest}} replaces subtropical rainforest on poorer soils or {{with increasing}} altitude and latitude in New South Wales and Victoria. Cool-temperate rainforests are widespread in Tasmania (Tasmanian temperate rain forests ecoregion) {{and they can}} be found scattered from the World Heritage listed Border Ranges National Park and Lamington National Park on the NSW/Queensland border to Otway Ranges, Strzelecki Ranges, Dandenong Ranges and Tarra Bulga in Victoria. In the northern NSW they are usually dominated by Antarctic Beech (Nothofagus moorei), in the southern NSW by <b>Pinkwood</b> (Eucryphia moorei) and Coachwood (Ceratopetalum apetalum) and in Victoria and Tasmania by Myrtle Beech (Nothofagus cunninghamii), Southern Sassafras (Atherosperma moschatum) and Mountain Ash (Eucalyptus regnans). The montane rainforests of Tasmania are dominated by Tasmanian endemic conifers (mainly Athrotaxis spp.). They are dominated by Ferns such as Cyathea cooperi, Cyathea australis, Dicksonia antarctica, Cyathea cunninghamii and Cyathea leichhardtiana.|$|E
