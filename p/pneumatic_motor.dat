50|$|<b>Pneumatic</b> <b>motors</b> {{have existed}} {{in many forms}} {{over the past two}} centuries, ranging in size from {{hand-held}} motors to engines of up to several hundred horsepower. Some types rely on pistons and cylinders; others on slotted rotors with vanes (vane motors) and others use turbines. Many compressed air engines improve their performance by heating the incoming air or the engine itself. <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>motors</b> have found widespread success in the hand-held tool industry, but are also used stationary {{in a wide range of}} industrial applications. Continual attempts are being made to expand their use to the transportation industry. However, <b>pneumatic</b> <b>motors</b> must overcome inefficiencies before being seen as a viable option in the transportation industry.|$|R

50|$|The pyropress is {{composed}} of two segments. The first is a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>motor</b> {{and the second is}} a hydraulic pump.

50|$|The <b>pneumatic</b> <b>motor</b> {{was first}} {{applied to the}} field of {{transportation}} in the mid-19th century. Though {{little is known about the}} first recorded compressed-air vehicle, it is said that the Frenchmen Andraud and Tessie of Motay ran a car powered by a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>motor</b> on a test track in Chaillot, France, on July 9, 1840. Although the car test was reported to have been successful, the pair didn’t explore further expansion of the design. The first successful application of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>motor</b> in transportation was the Mekarski system air engine used in locomotives. Mekarski’s innovative engine overcame cooling that accompanies air expansion by heating air in a small boiler prior to use. The Tramway de Nantes, located in Nantes, France, was noted for being the first to use Mekarski engines to power their fleet of locomotives. The tramway began operation on December 13, 1879, and continues to operate today, although the pneumatic trams were replaced in 1917 by more efficient and modern electrical trams. American Charles Hodges also found success with pneumatic motors in the locomotive industry. In 1911 he designed a pneumatic locomotive and sold the patent to the H.K. Porter Company in Pittsburgh for use in coal mines. Because pneumatic motors do not use combustion they were a much safer option in the coal industry.|$|E
50|$|Some motors are {{powered by}} {{potential}} or kinetic energy, for example some funiculars, gravity plane and ropeway conveyors {{have used the}} energy from moving water or rocks, and some clocks have a weight that falls under gravity. Other forms of potential energy include compressed gases (such as <b>pneumatic</b> <b>motors),</b> springs (clockwork motors) and elastic bands.|$|R

Guy Negre, CEO and founder of Zero Pollution Motors, has pioneered this field since the late 1980s. Recently Engineair has also developed a rotary motor for use in automobiles. Engineair places the motor immediately beside {{the wheel of the}} vehicle and uses no intermediate parts to transmit motion which means almost all of the motor's energy is used to rotate the wheel.|$|R

This operates with air for the motors and light for its sensors (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdESnc-oDZo YouTube movie).

50|$|A <b>pneumatic</b> <b>motor</b> (Air motor) or {{compressed}} air engine {{is a type}} of motor which does mechanical work by expanding {{compressed air}}. Pneumatic motors generally convert the compressed air energy to mechanical work through either linear or rotary motion.

The motor torque is so big that the motor {{can be used as}} a direct motor. In this report, the driving principle and design of this motor are presented. Its characteristics are analyzed experimentally and theoretically. The motors were applied to a parallel linkage mechanism with six degrees of freedom.
