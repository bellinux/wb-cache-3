In particular, {{the existence of a}} ClO·O 2 and ClOx water radical complexes like ClO·H 2 O, OClO·H 2 O, OClO·(H 2 O) 2, and ClOO·H 2 O could play a role in enhancing the ClO dimer (Cl 2 O 2) formation and therefore may constitute an important intermediate in <b>polar</b> stratospheric <b>ozone</b> loss cycles.

5000|$|In {{response}} to increasing {{public awareness of}} the greenhouse effect in the 1970s, conservative reaction built up, denying environmental concerns which could lead to government regulation. With the 1981 Presidency of Ronald Reagan, global warming became a political issue, with immediate plans to cut spending on environmental research, particularly climate related, and stop funding for [...] monitoring. Reagan appointed as Secretary of Energy James B. Edwards, who said that there was no real global warming problem. Congressman Al Gore had studied under Revelle and was aware of the developing science: he joined others in arranging congressional hearings from 1981 onwards, with testimony by scientists including Revelle, Stephen Schneider and Wallace Smith Broecker. The hearings gained enough public attention to reduce the cuts in atmospheric research. A polarized party-political debate developed. In 1982 Sherwood B. Idso published his book Carbon Dioxide: Friend or Foe? which said increases in [...] would not warm the planet, but would fertilize crops and were [...] "something to be encouraged and not suppressed", while complaining that his theories had been rejected by the [...] "scientific establishment". An Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) report in 1983 said global warming was [...] "not a theoretical problem but a threat whose effects will be felt within a few years", with potentially [...] "catastrophic" [...] consequences. The Reagan administration reacted by calling the report [...] "alarmist", and the dispute got wide news coverage. Public attention turned to other issues, then the 1985 finding of a <b>polar</b> <b>ozone</b> hole brought a swift international response. To the public, this was related to climate change and the possibility of effective action, but news interest faded.|$|E
25|$|Ozone {{depletion}} describes {{two related}} phenomena observed {{since the late}} 1970s: a steady decline of about four percent in {{the total amount of}} ozone in Earth's stratosphere (the ozone layer), and a much larger springtime decrease in stratospheric <b>ozone</b> around Earth's <b>polar</b> regions.

In order to track polar air over the warming period, total ozone trends are further analyzed using Ertel's potential vorticity...|$|R
40|$|Both {{dynamical}} {{and chemical}} mechanisms have been advanced {{to explain the}} decrease in total ozone in the Antarctic spring. Further analysis of satellite measurements show that during any one year, the September decline in total ozone near the South Pole is compensated by an increase at midlatitudes. The total ozone amount from 44 deg S to the pole remains almost unchanged from August through November even though both the polar and midlatitude values reach extremes during this period. These observations suggest that the variations within the spring season in south <b>polar</b> total <b>ozone</b> are governed by dynamical redistribution rather than chemical processes...|$|R
5000|$|As {{reported}} by the European Space Agency (ESA) on September 29, 2013, a new comparison of spacecraft data with computer models explains how global atmospheric circulation creates a layer of ozone (...) above Mars's southern pole in winter. Ozone was most likely difficult to detect on Mars because its concentration is typically 300 times lower than on Earth, although it varies greatly with location and time. The SPICAM —an UV/IR spectrometer— on board Mars Express has shown the presence of two distinct ozone layers at low-to-mid latitudes. These comprise a persistent, near-surface layer below an altitude of 30 km, a separate layer that is only present in northern spring and summer with an altitude varying from 30 to 60 km, and another separate layer that exists 40-60 km above the southern pole in winter, with no counterpart above the Mars's north pole. This third ozone layer shows an abrupt decrease in elevation between 75 and 50 degrees south. SPICAM detected a gradual increase in ozone concentration at 50 km until midwinter, after which it slowly decreased to very low concentrations, with no layer detectable above 35 km. The reporting scientists think that the observed <b>polar</b> <b>ozone</b> layers {{are the result of}} the same atmospheric circulation pattern that creates a distinct oxygen emission identified in the polar night and also present in Earth's atmosphere. This circulation {{takes the form of a}} huge Hadley cell in which warmer air rises and travels toward the south pole before cooling and sinking at higher latitudes. Mars is on a quite elliptical orbit and has a large axial tilt, which causes extreme seasonal variations in temperature amongst the northern and southern hemispheres. Mars's temperature difference greatly influences the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere, because warmer air can contain more moisture. This, in turn, affects the production of ozone-destroying hydrogen radicals.|$|E
40|$|The {{statistical}} {{relationship between}} springtime and summertime ozone over middle and polar latitudes is analyzed using zonally averaged total ozone data. Shortterm variations in springtime midlatitude ozone demonstrate {{only a modest}} correlation with springtime <b>polar</b> <b>ozone</b> variations. However by early summer, ozone variations throughout the extratropics are highly correlated. Analysis of correlation functions indicates that springtime midlatitude ozone, not <b>polar</b> <b>ozone,</b> is the best predictor for summertime <b>polar</b> <b>ozone.</b> Long-term total ozone trends at middle and high latitudes are also different for spring and nearly identical for summer. About 39 % of the observed southern midlatitude ozone decline in December {{can be attributed to}} the <b>polar</b> <b>ozone</b> depletion up to November.

40|$|The Antarctic {{ozone hole}} {{develops}} {{each year and}} culminates by early spring (late September - early October). The severity of the hole has been assessed from satellites using the minimum total ozone value from the October monthly mean (depth of the hole), calculating the average area coverage during this September-October period, and by estimating ozone mass deficit. Profile information shows that ozone is completely destroyed in the 14 - 2 1 km layer by early October. Ozone is mainly destroyed by halogen (chlorine and bromine) catalytic cycles, and these losses are modulated by temperature variations. Because atmospheric halogen levels are responding to international agreements that limit or phase out production, the amount of halogens in the stratosphere should decrease {{over the next few}} decades.

40|$|The {{impact and}} {{significance}} of uncertainties in model calculations of stratospheric ozone loss resulting from known uncertainty in chemical kinetics parameters is evaluated in trajectory chemistry simulations for the Antarctic and Arctic polar vortices. The uncertainty in modeled ozone loss is derived from Monte Carlo scenario simulations varying the kinetic (reaction and photolysis rate) parameters within their estimated uncertainty bounds. Simulations of a typical winter/spring Antarctic vortex scenario and Match scenarios in the Arctic produce large uncertainty in ozone loss rates and integrated seasonal loss. The simulations clearly indicate that the dominant source of model uncertainty in <b>polar</b> <b>ozone</b> loss is uncertainty in the Cl 2 O 2 photolysis reaction, which arises from uncertainty in laboratory-measured molecular cross sections at atmospherically important wavelengths. This estimated uncertainty in J Cl 2 O 2 from laboratory measurements seriously hinders our ability to model <b>polar</b> <b>ozone</b> loss within useful quantitative error limits. Atmospheric observations, however, suggest that the Cl 2 O 2 photolysis uncertainty may be less than that derived from the lab data. Comparisons to Match, South Pole ozonesonde, and Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) data all show that the nominal recommended rate simulations agree with data within uncertainties when the Cl 2 O 2 photolysis error is reduced {{by a factor of}} two, in line with previous in situ ClO x measurements. Comparisons to simulations using recent cross sections from Pope et al. (2007) are outside the constrained error bounds in each case.
