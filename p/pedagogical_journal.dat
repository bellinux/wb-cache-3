From 1905, greatly increased Jewish immigration to the US, following new pogroms in Russia, brought to America large numbers of politically sophisticated socialist Bundists. The Bundists advocated the anti-Zionist, anti-assimilationist idea of Yiddish cultural autonomy and a secular Jewish identity, led by education in Yiddish language and literature, socialist ideals, Jewish history and ethical and aesthetic culture, an idea championed by Chaim Zhitlowsky. Many of the Bundists joined The Workmen's Circle and pushed it both to fight exploitative labor practices and to expand its national activities toward Yiddish education and to focus on Yiddish culture, rather than simply providing financial aid. Many of the older members argued that the organization could barely afford to provide its traditional aid to members; this discussion continued for two decades. Zhitlowsky and the Bundists succeeded in persuading the organization to establish a range of cultural activities meant to inform and express the secular Jewish spirit, such as the Folksbiene Yiddish theatre troupe (1915), Yiddish book publishing, orchestras, and art expositions sponsored by the branches around the country, Yiddish after school programs for children and teens (beginning in 1918), adult lecture circuits, Camp Kinderland (1923) and the organization's own literary and political journal, The Friend, and Unser Schul (Our School), a monthly <b>pedagogical</b> <b>journal</b> for the teachers in its schools.|$|E

Each member should be involved in the kibbutz according to his capabilities; everybody receives from the kibbutz according to his needs. The program of communal education practiced there until the 1980 s is considered the most comprehensively explored educational system worldwide. The most significant characteristic of kibbutz education was the communal sleeping arrangement, i. e. the children slept not in the home of their parents, but with their peers in the children 2 ̆ 7 s houses where nurses (metaplot) took care of them. The collective as a whole felt responsible for the upbringing of the children. That system was regarded as the best prerequisite for preparing them for communal life. This paper, originally written for a Poltava <b>pedagogical</b> <b>journal,</b> describes and analyzes the development and changes of the system of kibbutz education. For ideological reasons the Ukrainian reader in Soviet times had no possibility to become acquainted with the world of the kibbutz.

In the prefaces to these volumes, the various editors all stressed two major points relevant to the development of this series. These comments also apply to this book.

Second, Teaching of Psychology (ToP) is recognized as one of the premier disciplinary <b>pedagogical</b> <b>journals</b> and, as such, regularly includes excellent articles on teaching the introductory course. Thus, a current, readily accessible, and organized collection of articles from ToP on teaching the introductory course should be an invaluable resource to introductory teachers, and indeed, this has proved to be the case for the first three volumes.

Today, instead, following the increasing question of measures and ends evaluation to knowledge and anticipatory purposes, the attention is actually set on the results of research.

This is remarkable, because the introduction of science in the curriculum marked an important shift {{in the history of the}} primary school. This article focuses on the pedagogical meaning of science education in the period after 1857, the year when several scientific subjects, like natural science and the ‘study of forms’, became obligatory to all pupils. Some teachers feared that this change would turn primary schools into industrial schools. This, however, was not the case. On the contrary, as became clear by studying cultural and <b>pedagogical</b> <b>journals,</b> teachers appreciated the benefits of science education because it supported the development of pupils in all the aspects of life: cognitive, moral and religious. Freethinkers are included in this research because their liberal theological thought and interest in the moral meaning of science was both exemplary and limiting for the identity of science education. The outcome of this article challenges the idea in historiography that the function of Dutch primary schools in the mid-nineteenth century was either socialisation or qualification. Instead, it intended to educate pupils towards ‘full humanity’, science education having an important role in this. </p...|$|R

40|$|Awhile ago, I had a {{conversation}} with a fellow who was, shall we say, “quantitatively disinclined. ” He complained vehemently about the use of numbers and grades as a sorting mechanism in higher education, and, given my affiliation with honors, he decided to focus his attacks in that direction. “It’s all about SATs, ACTs, and GPAs,” he claimed, “but education is so much more than that!” After quickly agreeing with him, I asked him to describe honors without referencing any grade or scoring system at all. Within minutes, he had a beautiful description of honors as a learning environment where a community of diverse students and teachers alike were challenged to expand their minds and exceed their potential. “Great,” I replied, “You’ve almost sold John Q. Student, but he has one question for you: Can he join?” The point of my remark was to underscore the importance of selection criteria to honors programs. In determining whom honors serves, such criteria become integral (though not necessarily central) to what honors does, for without a good fit between the program population and its activities, failure will swiftly follow. Of course, as my conversational partner argued, selection criteria need not be quantitatively based; but, I would reply, grades are not limited to quantitative means either. Portfolios, writing samples, interviews, standardized tests, transcripts—all have their strengths and their weaknesses when used as assessments or selection criteria. Obviously, this discussion is nothing new—one need only peruse the Chronicle of Higher Education or <b>pedagogical</b> <b>journals</b> to find similar opinions gaining in frequency, intensity, and legitimacy. The lead essay of this issue of JNCHC, Larry Andrews’ “Grades, Scores, and Honors,” does an excellent job of analyzing ways to encourage a connection between selection criteria and the purpose of your honors program.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines how}} Austria utilized its system {{of public education}} to develop loyalty to the multinational Habsburg Monarchy from 1867 - 1918. It draws {{from a range of}} sources, including textbooks, <b>pedagogical</b> <b>journals,</b> curricula, school chronicles, school year-end-reports, school inspection reports, and other records related to school administration to show that Austria developed a strong system of civic education which attempted to build a supranational, Austrian identity among its citizens. Its first chapter provides an overview of the Austrian educational system from the eighteenth century to 1914. It also discusses the development of the history curriculum in these schools and illustrates that it possessed a unique ability to serve as a conduit for civic education. The second chapter examines how textbooks and history classes presented Habsburg rulers in a way that portrayed the dynasty as the embodiment of good governance. It shows that such presentations sought to create an interpretation of the Habsburg past that served future rulers while teaching about Austria's history. This chapter is followed by an analysis of how these textbooks and classes used the Monarchy's history to support a supranational, Austrian identity in which its citizens were bound by common struggle and a shared past. Most importantly, this chapter shows that officials sought to create this identity in a way that supported existing local and national identities. The fourth chapter explores how school celebrations and patriotic events reinforced civic education efforts. It proves that there was a strong collaboration between schools and other agencies to create a consistent message about the Habsburg past which strengthened the supranational identity asserted by Austrian civic education. The final chapter discusses the efforts by the Austrian educational bureaucracy to ensure that teachers remained supporters of civic education efforts. Ultimately, this study shows that Austria possessed a nuanced, assertive system of civic education within its schools. This system of civic education attempted to create a layered identity among Austrians which blended loyalty to the imperial, dynastic state while also allowing for regional, and national identities to remain strong...|$|R
40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to explore the school as a site for ethical practice. Specific {{objectives}} were to elucidate, encourage understanding for, and discuss: (i) teachers' and students' lived experience of ethical situations in school, (ii) teachers' and students' working together to promote learning in subjects and also to develop an ethical attitude towards society and the way people interact, and (iii) teachers' and students' working together to create an appreciative and positive climate in school. The research was conducted in a secondary school in Northern Sweden, which participated in a school improvement process, entitled Full of Value. The process has aimed at promoting learning {{through the development of}} an ethical attitude. This involves both the psycho-social and the physical community of the school. The research was inspired by life-world phenomenology. A total of 45 teachers and 45 students participated in the study. To create empirical data, the following methods have been used: written reflection, interview, close observation, and photo documentation. Through empirical findings during the research process, some parts of the research were inspired by participatory and appreciative action research (PAAR). The thesis consists of five part studies, published in international <b>pedagogical</b> <b>journals.</b> The findings show essential values for teachers and students in school, such as: openness, communication, trust, respect, care, empathy, truth, justice, appreciation, participation, and mutual learning. Teachers' and students' experiences of school as a site for ethical practice imply the value of: striving for ethical awareness, building ethical relationships, and encouraging ethical actions. The findings in this thesis suggest that the schools' mission to integrate ethics into the curriculum {{can be viewed as a}} process whereby, together with students in different educational settings, an ethical learning community can be created and sustained.
