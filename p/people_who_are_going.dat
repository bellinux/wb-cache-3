25|$|The Going Home Song - A song sung {{every day}} (except Fridays {{due to the}} Official Chart) at 16:10, with three <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> home singing {{to the tune of}} Nut Rocker by B. Bumble and the Stingers. It is often themed, for people with {{specific}} characteristics. The feature has created some controversy on Rage Against the Answer Machine, with some saying 16:10 is too early for people to be going home, to which Greg responds that they cannot do lots of different Going Home Songs throughout the whole show. In May 2016, singer Craig David recorded his own version of the Going Home Song.|$|E

500|$|Cameron {{himself said}} {{he decided to}} open the film in December {{so that it would}} have less {{competition}} from then to January. Titanic capitalized on the same January predictability, and earned most of its gross in 1998. Additionally, Avatar established itself as a [...] "must-see" [...] event. Gray said, [...] "At this point, <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to see Avatar are going to see Avatar and would even if the slate was strong." [...] Marketing the film as a [...] "novelty factor" [...] also helped. Fox positioned the film as a cinematic event that should be seen in the theatres. [...] "It's really hard to sell the idea that you can have the same experience at home," [...] stated David Mumpower, an analyst at BoxOfficeProphets.com. The [...] "Oscar buzz" [...] surrounding the film and international viewings helped. [...] "Two-thirds of Titanics haul was earned overseas, and Avatar [...] similarly...Avatar opened in 106 markets globally and was No. 1 in all of them", and the markets [...] "such as Russia, where Titanic saw modest receipts in 1997 and 1998, are white-hot today" [...] with [...] "more screens and moviegoers" [...] than before.|$|E

500|$|In March 1967, the United States Senate Committee on Labor's Subcommittee on Poverty held {{a series}} of hearings, as part of the ongoing [...] "War on Poverty." [...] One of the testifying {{witnesses}} was Marian Wright, a 27 year-old Yale Law School graduate working with the NAACP's Legal Defense Fund in Mississippi. She told the subcommittee that increased mechanization and requirements that cotton fields lie fallow under federal subsidy stipulations had put thousands of black sharecroppers out of work in the Mississippi Delta. In addition to this, two-parent families were ineligible for many welfare benefits, and most counties in Mississippi had switched welfare programs from one that distributed surplus food to an alternative that required a monthly purchase of food stamps. With little to no income, most households could not produce the necessary funds. As a result, Wright argued, Mississippians were [...] "starving. They're starving, and those who can get the bus fare to go north are trying to go north... I wish that [...] would have a chance to go and just look at the empty cupboards in the Delta and the number of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> around and begging just to feed their children." ...|$|E

2500|$|He further commented [...] "What I did, I {{wanted to}} take that to the next level. It is a video game. <b>People</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to say, 'hey he fucked with the movie,' that's being ridiculous. I wanted to have fun and kind of create {{something}} on my own, while sticking to the same tone and flavor of the flick. People want to laugh when they're playing a game, and I just {{wanted to take}} advantage of that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Zuel {{felt the}} album [...] "doesn't {{sound like a}} 15-year-old's choice. It is darker and more subdued than her debut, which sold to teens and adults and marked Blasko as an {{intriguing}} rising star; the second album is liberally spotted with regrets, plans for reconciliations and a quest {{to make sense of}} life". Susan Frances at AbsolutePunk.net rates the musicianship and production higher than Blasko's vocals, where [...] " [...] is made up to sound more impressive than she actually is on the album ... a limited range so the tunes have a mundane drone. Her vocal melodies transform the girl next door to a femme fatale figure which may explain why so many of those radiant reviews for her album come from male writers". Frances summarises the album as [...] "pleasant and relates to <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> through a loss or a low point in their lives ... tailored for those going through woeful moods".|$|E
2500|$|The Blue Jays began a 7-game {{road trip}} in Baltimore on May 11. The game played {{that night was}} the first to be played in Baltimore {{following}} the empty-stadium game played on April 29, due to the 2015 Baltimore protests. Toronto would lose, 5–2. In the second game, Toronto would come from behind 2–0 to win 10–2, helped by a two-home run night from Edwin Encarnacion. Toronto lost the rubber match, 6–1, and did not record an extra-base hit {{for the first time in}} the 2015 season. The loss also broke a 31-game streak with at least 1 double. The Blue Jays then travelled to Houston, taking on the AL West-leading Astros. Toronto was swept by Houston, losing 6–4, 8–4, 6–5, and 4–2. Following their third loss to Houston, Josh Donaldson called out his teammates for their poor play, stating [...] "this isn't the 'try' league, this is the 'get it done' league. And you know, eventually they're gonna find <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to get it done." ...|$|E

5000|$|The dark humor/psychological thriller, Drama Dolls, {{was born}} after Tanamor watched a {{documentary}} about grown men dressing up as dolls and going out in public.

[...] "You {{see one of}} the {{greatest}} nations in the world going through its hour of agony, and you think nothing but how you yourselves will be affected! Every thinking person in Russia regrets that this thing should have come to pass at such a time. Yet it is best for you English to look the truth in the face. It wasn't the Russian people who were pledged to you, with whom you were bound in alliance. It was that accursed trick all European politicians have of making secret treaties and secret understandings, building up buffer States, trying to whittle away a piece of the map for yourselves, trying all the time to be dishonest under the shadow of what is called diplomacy. That is what brought the war about. It was never the will of the people. It was the Hohenzollerns and the Romanoffs, the firebrands of the French Cabinet, and your own clumsy, thick-headed efforts to get the best of everybody and yet keep your Nonconformist conscience. The people did not make this war, but it is the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to end it." ...|$|E

I don't suppose there is anything particularly beautiful about Theos," [...] the King continued, thoughtfully, [...] "yet to me her quiet country places, her vineyards and farms, her whole rural life has seemed so simple and charming. I have seen my people at their play and at their daily tasks, a cheerful, honest people, light-hearted and fond of pleasure perhaps--why not? The thought of a blackened country, her vineyards and corn-fields red with blood, the homesteads in flames, my poor peasants fighting to the death against cruel odds--it is hideous!

50|$|J2O is a still {{soft drink}} made from fruit juices. It is {{manufactured}} by Britvic {{and sold in}} the United Kingdom and Ireland. Its launch in 1998 was aimed at providing an alternative solution for <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> out to bars and clubs but were not drinking alcoholic beverages. The name ‘J2O’ is a pun on the chemical formula for water, H2O, chosen due to the drink's 50% fruit juice content. The first flavours available were Orange & Passion fruit, Apple & Mango and Apple & Melon, but the range has progressively grown since.|$|R
60|$|On we flew, {{drawn by}} the mighty current, till at last I noticed that {{the sound of the}} water was not half so {{deafening}} as it had been, and concluded that this must be because there was more room for the echoes to disperse in. I could now hear Alphonse's howls much more distinctly; they were made up of the oddest mixture of invocations to the Supreme Power and the name of his beloved Annette {{that it is possible to}} conceive; and, in short, though their evident earnestness saved them from profanity, were, to say the least, very remarkable. Taking up a paddle I managed to drive it into his ribs, whereon he, thinking that the end had come, howled louder than ever. Then I slowly and cautiously raised myself on my knees and stretched my hand upwards, but could touch no roof. Next I took the paddle and lifted it above my head as high as I could, but with the same result. I also thrust it out laterally to the right and left, but could touch nothing except water. Then I bethought me that there was in the boat, amongst our other remaining possessions, a bull's-eye lantern and a tin of oil. I groped about and found it, and having a match on me carefully lit it, and as soon as the flame had got a hold of the wick I turned it on down the boat. As it happened, the first thing the light lit on was the white and scared face of Alphonse, who, thinking that it was all over at last, and that he was witnessing a preliminary celestial phenomenon, gave a terrific yell and was with difficulty reassured with the paddle. As for the other three, Good was lying on the flat of his back, his eyeglass still fixed in his eye, and gazing blankly into the upper darkness. Sir Henry had his head resting on the thwarts of the canoe, and with his hand was trying to test the speed of the water. But when the beam of light fell upon old Umslopogaas I could really have laughed. I think I have said that we had put a roast quarter of water-buck into the canoe. Well, it so happened that when we all prostrated ourselves to avoid being swept out of the boat and into the water by the rock roof, Umslopogaas's head had come down uncommonly near this roast buck, and so soon as he had recovered a little from the first shock of our position it occurred to him that he was hungry. Thereupon he coolly cut off a chop with Inkosi-kaas, and was now employed in eating it with every appearance of satisfaction. As he afterwards explained, he thought that he was going 'on a long journey', and preferred to start on a full stomach. It reminded me of the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to be hanged, and who are generally reported in the English daily papers to have made 'an excellent breakfast'.|$|E

60|$|Once only, at {{a garden}} party, did he touch {{the tips of}} her fingers, but no more. She never met his eye, but threw herself into eager flirtation with the men he most disliked, while the lovely {{carnation}} was mounting in her cheek, and betraying unusual excitement. It became known that she <b>was</b> <b>going</b> early in July into the country with some gay <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to give a series of fetes on some public occasion, and then that she was to go with Lady Clanmacnalty and her unmarried daughter to Scotland, to help them entertain the grouse-shoot-party.|$|R
60|$|But {{he had no}} {{opportunity}} to say anything in his own defence, for at that moment Dolly herself appeared, and struck him quite dumb with her beauty. Never had Dolly looked so handsome as she did then, in all the glow and grace of youth, with all her charms increased a hundredfold by a most becoming dress, by a thousand little coquettish ways which nobody could assume with a better grace, and all the sparkling expectation of that accursed party. It is impossible to tell how Joe hated that party wherever it was, {{and all the other}} <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to it, whoever they were.|$|R
60|$|Nothing {{happened}} that day except that some priests arrived, lifted the earthenware pot, examined their departed colleague, who by now had become an unencouraging spectacle, removed old dishes of food, arranged more about him, and went off. Also the clouds grew thicker and thicker, and the air more and more chilly, till, had we been in any northern latitude, I should have said that snow was pending. From our perch on the roof-top I observed the population of Simba Town discussing the weather with ever-increasing eagerness; also that the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> out {{to work in the}} fields wore mats over their shoulders.|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} secure their power, local nobles instituted a law which {{prohibited}} the election into the ruling council of anyone whose father or grandfather was not its member. This legalized oligarchy proclaimed itself a god's institution, and passed criminal laws that greatly discriminated the ordinary citizens. The nobility went by the Medieval principle of intimidation, by which ordinary people {{were more likely to}} commit crimes, and that evil <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to commit them anyway, could only be intimidated into obedience. This made it seem as though all ordinary citizens were potentially evil, and should be treated with that in mind. The legal discrimination was another deciding factor in the Rebellion.|$|R
