5|$|On 24 October 2014, it was {{reported}} that the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant had used chlorine gas in the town of Duluiyah, Iraq. Laboratory analysis of clothing and soil samples confirmed the use of chlorine gas against Kurdish <b>Peshmerga</b> Forces in a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device attack on 23 January 2015 at the Highway 47 Kiske Junction near Mosul.|$|E
5|$|USSOCOM's 10th Special Forces Group, {{elements}} of JSOC and CIA/SAD Paramilitary Officers linked {{up again and}} {{were the first to}} enter Iraq prior to the invasion. Their efforts organized the Kurdish <b>Peshmerga</b> to defeat Ansar Al Islam in Northern Iraq before the invasion. This battle was for control of a territory in Northeastern Iraq that was completely occupied by Ansar Al Islam, an ally of Al Qaeda. This was a very significant battle and led to the termination of a substantial number of terrorists and the uncovering of a chemical weapons facility at Sargat. These terrorists {{would have been in the}} subsequent insurgency had they not been eliminated during this battle. Sargat was the only facility of its type discovered in the Iraq war. This battle may have been the Tora Bora of Iraq, but it was a sound defeat for Al Qaeda and their ally Ansar Al Islam. This combined team then led the <b>Peshmerga</b> against Saddam's northern Army. This effort kept Saddam's forces in the north and denied the ability to redeploy to contest the invasion force coming from the south. This effort may have saved the lives of hundreds if not thousands of coalition service men and women.|$|E
5|$|Various {{municipal}} and government buildings {{were put on}} fire in Mosul and Kirkuk by Kurdish forces on 10 and 11 April 2003. A Turkish daily newspaper reported that the Turkish Special Forces soldiers, who were captured by US Army and <b>Peshmerga,</b> had already filmed the deed records and sent the digital records to Turkey before the historical records were terminated. The newspaper also reported that the US party was, in fact, in search of those records, but {{they were unable to}} find them. However, Turkish Ministry of Public Works declared that the ministry archives holds historical deed records from the Ottoman era and there were no operations involved.|$|E
25|$|The {{uprising}} {{started on}} 7 March as lightly armed <b>Peshmerga</b> entered {{the city and}} ousted government forces. The <b>Peshmerga</b> were joined by local civilians, who took the streets and helped the <b>Peshmerga</b> launch a mass assault on all government buildings and detention centers, freeing hundreds of political prisoners.|$|E
25|$|On 29 May, <b>Peshmerga</b> forces, {{consisting}} of 5,500 fighters, {{supported by the}} Coalition airstrikes, retook al-Muftiyah and Jim Kour towns near Mosul. From 28 to 30 May, <b>Peshmerga</b> forces recaptured nine villages to the southeast of Mosul, including Mufti, Tulaband, Shuqali and Wardak. Four <b>Peshmerga</b> fighters and 140 ISIL militants {{were killed in the}} clashes.|$|E
25|$|On 17 December 2014, at 7 AM (04.00 GMT), <b>Peshmerga</b> forces, {{directed}} personally by Masoud Barzani, the President of Iraqi Kurdistan, {{launched an}} offensive on the Sinjar area, backed by US-led coalition airstrikes that {{had started the}} night before. About 8,000 <b>Peshmerga</b> forces started advancing westward from Zummar, which had been recaptured by the <b>Peshmerga</b> in October 2014. A total of 45 airstrikes had been conducted by the US-led Coalition by end of the day. The <b>Peshmerga</b> were supported with training and equipment by a British Army training team.|$|E
25|$|After {{the defeat}} of rebels {{in the south and}} the fall of all {{southern}} cities to Iraqi security forces, the Iraqi government turned north, where they deployed aircraft, heavy artillery and tanks to confront the <b>Peshmerga.</b> With food shortages and no international backing, the <b>Peshmerga</b> were outmanned and outgunned, with over three-quarters of the Iraqi army on the outskirts of Sulaymaniyah and 20,000 <b>Peshmerga</b> protecting the city. Heavy fighting occurred around the outskirts. The <b>Peshmerga</b> eventually retreated into central Sulaymaniyah after withstanding a ten-day assault by over 90,000 Iraqi troops supported by tanks and aircraft. Casualties were heavy on both sides. The outgunned <b>Peshmerga</b> lost 6,000 of their original strength of only 20,000, and because the Iraqi army lacked tactical training, they suffered dramatic casualties and lost nearly 17,000 troops.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Peshmerga</b> fought {{alongside}} the US Army {{and the coalition}} in the northern front during Operation Iraqi Freedom. During the following years, the <b>Peshmerga</b> played {{a vital role in}} security for Kurdistan and other parts of Iraq. Not a single coalition soldier or foreigner has been killed, wounded or kidnapped in Kurdistan since the invasion of Iraq in 2003. The <b>Peshmerga</b> have also been deployed in Baghdad and al-Anbar governorate for anti-terror operations.|$|E
25|$|On 16 March, the <b>Peshmerga</b> bombed ISIL strongholds in the Forest area {{of central}} Mosul from Mount Baashiqa, killing and {{wounding}} dozens of ISIL fighters. Eight days later, <b>Peshmerga</b> forces clashed with ISIL forces in eastern Mosul, killing 13 ISIL militants.|$|E
25|$|On 18 April, US and <b>Peshmerga</b> forces {{carried out}} a raid in Hamam Alil, {{to the south of}} Mosul, killing three ISIL militants. One of them was Salam Abd Shabib al-Jbouri, the top ISIL {{commander}} in Mosul. On the same day, the <b>Peshmerga</b> launched an offensive on Khorsabad, to the northeast of Mosul, capturing the villages of Nawara and Barima, as well as the Khorsabad Intersection, to the north of Khorsabad. By 19 April, <b>Peshmerga</b> forces entered Khorsabad.|$|E
25|$|Arriving in July 2002 to Iraqi Kurdistan, the CIA seldom {{worked with}} the <b>peshmerga,</b> despite their claim {{to be on a}} counterterrorism mission against Ansar al-Islam. To the {{disappointment}} of PUK <b>peshmerga</b> intent on destroying Ansar al-Islam, the true mission of the CIA was to acquire intelligence about the Iraqi government and military. CIA-peshmerga operations eventually went beyond the scope of intelligence gathering however, as PUK <b>peshmerga</b> were used to destroy key rail lines and buildings prior to the U.S. attack in March 2003. Following Turkey's decision to deny any official use of its territory, the Coalition was forced to modify the planned simultaneous attack from north and south. Special Operations forces from the CIA and US Army managed to build and lead the Kurdish <b>Peshmerga</b> into an effective force and assault for the North.|$|E
25|$|On 21 December, 1,500 Iraqi Kurdish <b>Peshmerga</b> fighters, {{backed by}} local militia units, {{reportedly}} drove ISIL {{from the center}} of Sinjar. By this time, Kurdish forces had recaptured more than 500 square miles of mostly desert and highway. On the morning of 22 December, <b>Peshmerga</b> took control of much of Sinjar city.|$|E
25|$|A {{few days}} after Kurdish forces entered Sinjar, a {{high-ranking}} <b>Peshmerga</b> commander {{said in an interview}} that the push into the town was premature, as retaking Sinjar was not planned to be carried out in this offensive. According to him, some of the <b>Peshmerga</b> entered Sinjar without orders to do so, after seeing ISIL militants on the run.|$|E
25|$|The KDP {{believes}} {{that the presence of}} the PKK in Sinjar is illegal, and that their own <b>Peshmerga</b> forces are the only legitimate security force of the area. The Rojava <b>Peshmerga</b> are Syrian Kurdish fighters affiliated with the KNC, which in turn was set up by the KDP, and effectively operate as part of the KDP's regular armed forces.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{autonomy}} agreement collapsed in 1974, Kurds {{had been fighting}} an armed insurgency against Saddam's regime. After the Gulf War heavily damaged the Iraqi military and an uprising began in Southern Iraq, Jash (Kurdish militia used by Saddam Hussein's regime to fight <b>Peshmerga)</b> deserters, seized control {{of the city of}} Raniya with support of the local population. Many of the militia took sides with the <b>Peshmerga.</b> The revolutionary feeling spread to the rest of Kurdistan, where people took to the streets and <b>Peshmerga</b> entered the cities and seized control of Raniya, Chawar Qurna, Koi-Sanjaq, Sulaymaniya, Halabja, Arbat, Arbil, Duhuk, Zahku and Kirkuk.|$|E
25|$|On 6 February 2015, an RAF Tornado GR4 patrol {{worked closely}} with a {{coalition}} surveillance platform to provide air support for <b>Peshmerga</b> forces, who were engaged in close combat with ISIL terrorists near Mosul. When an ISIL mortar position opened fire on the <b>Peshmerga,</b> the Tornados responded with a Brimstone missile, scoring a direct hit.|$|E
25|$|As ISIL militants withdrew to Tal Afar and Mosul amid {{constant}} air attack, the <b>Peshmerga</b> {{expanded their}} offensive to Tal Afar — a large Turkmen city, located between Sinjar to Mosul and captured by ISIL in their June offensive — Kurdish officials said. On 19 December, <b>Peshmerga</b> were {{closing in on}} Tal Afar, firing artillery at ISIL positions nearby, residents reported.|$|E
25|$|On 19 December, one {{day after}} the retaking of Mount Sinjar, the <b>Peshmerga</b> {{launched}} a new offensive from the Rabia border crossing southward to Mount Sinjar. The new offensive was launched at 8 AM (05.00 GMT), with the aim of further clearing the area north of Mount Sinjar. Simultaneously, <b>Peshmerga</b> forces on Mount Sinjar started pushing northward and captured Snuny, located on the road to Rabia.|$|E
25|$|On 27 January 2015, ISIL {{launched}} a surprise {{attack on the}} oil-rich Kurdish city of Kirkuk, {{in an attempt to}} draw Kurdish <b>Peshmerga</b> fighters away from Mosul. However, <b>Peshmerga</b> forces managed to staunch the attack and regain some lost territory in the region, with the US ramping up their airstrikes near Kirkuk to 19 on 1 February 2015, in response to the ISIL advance.|$|E
25|$|On 26 March 2003, the 173rd Airborne Brigade {{augmented}} the invasion's northern front by parachuting {{into northern}} Iraq onto Bashur Airfield, controlled {{at the time}} by elements of 10th SFG and Kurdish <b>peshmerga.</b> The fall of Kirkuk on 10 April 2003 to the 10th SFG, CIA Paramilitary Teams and Kurdish <b>peshmerga</b> precipitated the 173rd's planned assault, preventing the unit's involvement in combat against Iraqi forces during the invasion.|$|E
25|$|On 31 March, the {{government}} offensive {{against the city}} itself started. It began from the west {{and focused on the}} civilian neighborhoods of Bakhtiari and Rizjari. The district of Azadi was also hit by heavy shelling and by attacks from helicopters. On 1 April, the <b>Peshmerga</b> attacked Iraqi tanks from the hills overlooking Bakhtiari, destroying a quarter of the Iraqi army's tanks; but by 2 April the <b>Peshmerga</b> called on civilians to evacuate the town and flee north before the Iraqi forces entered. In a last attempt to hold the city, the <b>Peshmerga</b> launched the suicidal Shahid Mahmood offensive, in which they wiped out several lines of Iraqi infantrymen, {{and by the end of}} 2 April had successfully captured the Sannandj road. To avoid annihilation, the remaining <b>Peshmerga</b> retreated back to Mount Qandil. By 3 April, the military took control of the city, which had turned into a ghost town as all civilians had fled in fear of government reprisals. The city therefore also remained relatively intact, although suffered heavy looting from Iraqi soldiers.|$|E
25|$|On 17 October, the <b>Peshmerga</b> in Khazer {{started the}} ground assault and {{captured}} at least 9 villages during the day.|$|E
25|$|On 30 August, the Iraqi Army, Shi'ite {{militias and}} <b>Peshmerga</b> started a {{campaign}} to break the siege, after the speaker of Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Abdul-Mahdi al-Karabalai, called to move and break the siege by ISIS on the town. The forces attacked ISIS from three areas, the army attacked from the south of Amirli in Adhaim, the <b>Peshmerga</b> attacked from the north in Tuz Khormato, the militias attacked from the east in Kifri.|$|E
25|$|Kurdish-Iraqi <b>peshmerga</b> {{forces were}} put on alert and {{prevented}} Turkish military monitors in northern Iraq from leaving their camps.|$|E
25|$|On 3 May, at 7:30am, 125 ISIL militants {{with more}} than 20 {{vehicles}} attacked a <b>Peshmerga</b> position, {{near the town of}} Tel Skuf, 28–30km north of Mosul, where a dozen U.S. troops acting as advisors were visiting. American and <b>Peshmerga</b> forces fought back but the militants broke into the position using three truck bombs followed by bulldozers which cleared the wreckage away. The <b>Peshmerga</b> and U.S. forces called for a Quick Reaction Force (QRF) which responded and joined the battle, helping the advisors and other personnel to withdraw. 11 to 13 U.S. aircraft; F-15s F-16s, A-10s, B-52s and two drones carried out 31 airstrikes, which destroyed two more truck bombs, and together the coalition forces repelled the attack. The battle continued for another 12 hours, in total; 58 militants were killed, three mortars and 20 of their vehicles were destroyed, <b>Peshmerga</b> forces captured at least three US-made Humvees that ISIL had itself captured from the Iraqi military in 2014. Special Warfare Operator 1st Class Charles Keating IV; a U.S. Navy SEAL who was part of the QRF, was struck by direct ISIL small arms fire at 9:32am, he was medevaced to a medical facility in Erbil where he later died of his wound, making him the third American serviceman to be killed in combat during Operation Inherent Resolve in Iraq. 10 <b>Peshmerga</b> fighters were also killed and a further 30 wounded, two U.S. medevac helicopters were also damaged by small arms fire. The Islamic State attack was part of their counter-offensive on multiple fronts overnight to obtain new ground. Near Tel Skuf, ISIL covertly assembled their forces and attacked before 6am into Kurdish territory, destroying a <b>Peshmerga</b> checkpoint on the way to Tel Skuf. Iraqi military sources said that special forces had foiled an attack by five suicide bombers in the village of Khirbirdan, and <b>Peshmerga</b> forces repelled an Islamic State assault on Wardak. Coalition aircraft carried out seven airstrikes near Mosul, hitting six groups of ISIL fighters as well as two vehicles, three weapons caches, a mortar system and other targets. U.S. Army Colonel Steve Warren labeled the offensive {{as one of the most}} complex battlefield operations launched by ISIL since December 2015.|$|E
25|$|Despite their well-armed adversaries, {{during the}} {{operation}} only 24 <b>peshmerga</b> {{were killed in}} the fighting, compared to an enemy body count of over 300.|$|E
25|$|On 16 October 2017, the Iraqi {{national}} army and PMF militia retook control of Kirkuk, {{which had been}} under Kurdish <b>Peshmerga</b> control since 2014..|$|E
25|$|By 15 August, {{the number}} of villages {{captured}} by <b>Peshmerga</b> rose to 12 during the operation and reached the western Kanhash side al-Kwir (Gwer) bridge, capturing the area. The newly captured villages were Sanf, Homaira, Hasudiya, small Kahnash and big Kahnash. The <b>Peshmerga</b> command announced {{the end of the}} offensive after the villages were captured. About 165 ISIL militants died during the offensive. On 16 August, Kurdistan Democratic Party official confirmed that ISIL's ‘Minister of Media’ Abu Aed al-Shami was killed during the offensive.|$|E
25|$|On 2 March, the Rojava <b>Peshmerga</b> {{stated that}} they would {{relocate}} to the Syrian border near al-Hawl {{in order to stop}} smuggling operations, but as they moved further south into the Sinjar Mountains, they came into conflict with the Sinjar Resistance Units at Khanasor. The KNC forces later claimed that they had been blocked by the YBŞ while simply passing through the area, while the YBŞ in turn argued that the Rojava <b>Peshmerga</b> had attempted to occupy Khanasor on the orders of Turkey and the Kurdistan Democratic Party.|$|E
25|$|On 21 January 2015, 5,000 Kurdish <b>Peshmerga</b> {{soldiers}} liberated multiple villages neighboring Mosul, amid {{speculation that}} the Iraqi Army was preparing for an assault on Mosul. The <b>Peshmerga</b> forces also disrupted essential ISIL supply routes between Mosul, Tel Afar, and Syria, and they reclaimed over 500 kilometers {{of land in the}} region. However, Kurdish officials states that they do not plan to move beyond primarily-Kurdish areas, and that retaking the city of Mosul itself was the responsibility of the Iraqi Army. An estimated 200 ISIL fighters were killed. Among the ISIL militants killed was the new ISIL governor of the Nineveh Governorate. <b>Peshmerga</b> forces also positioned themselves on three fronts to the northwest of Mosul, near Badush Dam. Kurdish forces reported firing 20 Grad missiles into Mosul, upon receiving intelligence that ISIL militants were gathering to meet near the city's Zuhour neighborhood. Firing from about 12 miles north of Mosul, Captain Shivan Ahmed said the rockets hit their targets. ISIL claimed that the rockets hit civilians.|$|E
25|$|On December 17, 2015 ISIL {{mounted a}} major {{offensive}} against Kurdish positions but were repelled by the <b>Peshmerga</b> and included contact between Canadian special {{forces on the}} ground and ISIL.|$|E
25|$|The {{last and}} biggest point of {{resistance}} by the Iraqi security forces was the heavily fortified Security Directorate. Ba'athist forces fought off the Kurds for over 2 hours, after which Kurdish <b>Peshmerga</b> and rioters entered the building; by 8 March, {{the entire city}} was under <b>Peshmerga</b> control. Many captured Ba'athists were torn to pieces, alive, by the angry crowds; others were burned or cut to pieces with saws. According to Human Rights Watch, an estimated 700 Ba'athists security personnel were killed in such executions by the people, but regular soldiers were mostly pardoned and allowed to return home.|$|E
25|$|In September 2012, the Iraqi {{government}} {{ordered the}} KRG to transfer its powers over the <b>Peshmerga</b> {{to the central}} government. Relations became further strained by {{the formation of a}} new command center (Tigris Operation Command) for Iraqi forces to operate in a disputed area over which both Baghdad and the Kurdistan Regional Government claim jurisdiction. On 16 November 2012 a military clash between the Iraqi forces and the <b>Peshmerga</b> resulted in one person killed. CNN reported that two people were killed (one of them an Iraqi soldier) and ten wounded in clashes at the Tuz Khurmato town.|$|E
25|$|On 16 September, the US-led {{coalition}} {{carried out}} airstrikes against an ISIL tactical position near Qayyarah that destroyed a vehicle, a weapons cache and 29 watercrafts {{belonging to the}} group. The coalition also carried out airstrikes near Mosul and Qayyarah, destroying eight fighting positions of the group along with a tunnel. Meanwhile, hundreds of American troops arrived at Qayyarah Airfield West to support Iraqi Armed Forces in capturing Mosul. On 17 September, a senior leader Tamas al-Shishani was killed along with several other militants in an airstrike {{carried out by the}} anti-ISIL coalition near al-Shur which is located south of Mosul. On 18 September, ISIL launched two separate offensives at Bashiqa and Gwer. Both of the offensives however were repelled by the <b>Peshmerga.</b> The militants also attacked a <b>Peshmerga</b> headquarters in Khazir district which is located east of Mosul. The group launched three simultaneous car bombs on security checkpoints, followed by shelling of the headquarters. At least 4 <b>Peshmerga</b> fighters were killed in the attack while 7 were wounded.|$|E
25|$|On 4 March, {{a ceasefire}} {{had come into}} effect, with PKK-affiliated groups and the KNC {{negotiating}} a solution of the conflict, though pro-PKK media claimed that the <b>peshmerga</b> prepared a new attack on Khanasor.|$|E
25|$|Early on 29 April 2015, {{the last}} 124 <b>Peshmerga</b> fighters {{stationed}} in Kobanî returned to Iraqi Kurdistan, {{as the city}} had been secured. Iraqi Kurdistan also stated that no more troops {{would be sent to}} Kobanî.|$|E
