5|$|In July 1960, Takawira and {{two other}} NDP {{officials}} were arrested; in protest, Mugabe joined a demonstration of 7,000 people who planned to march from Highfield to the Prime Minister's office in Salisbury. The demonstration was stopped by riot police outside Stoddart Hall in Harare township. By midday the next day, the crowd had grown to 40,000 and a makeshift platform had been erected for speakers. Having become a much-respected figure through his profession, his possession of three degrees, and his travels abroad, Mugabe was among those invited {{to speak to the}} crowd. Following this event, Mugabe decided to devote himself full-time to activism, resigning his teaching post in Ghana (after having served two years of the four year teaching contract). He chaired the first NDP congress, held in October 1960, assisted by Chitepo on the <b>procedural</b> <b>aspects.</b> Mugabe was elected the party's publicity secretary. Mugabe consciously injected emotionalism into the NDP's African nationalism, hoping to broaden its support among the wider population by appealing to traditional cultural values. He helped to form the NDP Youth Wing and encouraged the incorporation of ancestral prayers, traditional costume, and female ululation into its meetings. In February 1961 he married Hayfron in a Roman Catholic ceremony conducted in Salisbury; she had converted to Catholicism to make this possible.|$|E

Both parents expressed concern over a potentially premature decision.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we attempt}} to combine {{the concept of a}} choice {{function}} with a <b>procedural</b> <b>aspect.</b> We examine an individual’s choices over alternatives when the available options are linked either to the procedure by which these alternatives came into existence or to the degree of availability of other options. The <b>procedural</b> <b>aspect</b> behind availability may prompt an individual to refuse to choose so that the choice set becomes empty. This particular aspect is used to study different cases that are characterized axiomatically. We relate our conditions to well-known consistency conditions from standard choice theory.

25|$|The {{average time}} to death once a lethal {{injection}} protocol has been started is about 7 to 11 minutes. Since {{it only takes}} about 30 seconds for the thiopental to induce anesthesia, 30–45 seconds for the pancuronium to cause paralysis, and about 30 seconds for the potassium to stop the heart, death can theoretically be attained {{in as little as}} 90 seconds. Given that it takes time to administer the drug, time for the line to flush itself, time for the change of the drug being administered, and time to ensure that death has occurred, the whole procedure takes about 7–11 minutes. <b>Procedural</b> <b>aspects</b> in pronouncing death also contribute to delay, so the condemned is usually pronounced dead within 10 to 20 minutes of starting the drugs. Supporters of the death penalty say that a huge dose of thiopental, which is between 14 and 20 times the anesthetic induction dose and which has the potential to induce a medical coma lasting 60 hours, could never wear off in only 10 to 20 minutes.|$|E
500|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{it has also}} been {{suggested}} that substantive natural justice would merely be a full exercise of the judiciary's proper role as conferred by the Constitution. In addition, one scholar has asserted that {{there is no doubt that}} a judicial inquiry covers both substantive and <b>procedural</b> <b>aspects.</b> It is said that Article 9(1) connotes a judicial inquiry into the [...] "fairness" [...] of the law tested against certain principles regarded as fundamental to the legal system. Distinguishing between substantive and procedural fairness is a meaningless exercise, as it merely clouds the process of judicial inquiry. Judicial review is judicial review under whatever name, and as far as Article 9(1) is concerned, there is no room for making this distinction.|$|E

500|$|In 1289, grave {{complaints}} arose of the maladministration of {{the entire}} justice system during King Edward I's absence in Gascony. The wide-ranging royal enquiry that followed in 1290 found that Thomas Weyland, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas had, among other offences, erased an entry in the plea rolls and substituted a false one, evidently in collusion with {{a party to the}} case. Weyland's offences were severe enough that he had his goods and chattels confiscated and he was exiled from the realm. Weyland, three of the four other Justices of the Common Pleas (who did not participate in the fraud but were held responsible for not preventing it), and the Master of the Rolls were heavily fined. The three judges of the Court of King's Bench were also dimissed. Beckingham was the only Justice of the Common Pleas acquitted of the charges. He thereby gained a historical record for probity. More recently, {{it has been suggested that}} his escape from censure may simply have been due to his absence from Westminster Hall the previous year whilst on the Dorsetshire eyre, where it is known that fines were levied before him, and the Lyme Regis burgess' pleas to Queen Eleanor heard. He appears to have continued in the discharge of his duties until 1307, for he was regularly summoned to parliament as a justice between 1288 and 1305. From the fact that he was no longer summoned to parliament after the latter date, it may be inferred that he died or retired before the date when parliament next met. His work within the courts seems to have leaned towards the [...] "more routine" [...] <b>procedural</b> <b>aspects</b> of court work.|$|E
2500|$|Lim Chin Leng has {{opined that}} to accord {{principles}} of natural justice an elevated constitutional status may {{cause it to}} override statutes, which might contradict the Constitution which vests the law making power in the legislature. Similarly, Andrew J. Harding disagrees {{with the idea of}} [...] "substantive natural justice" [...] because, in his view, it cannot be shown that it was the Privy Council's intent to apply natural justice in a substantive sense, since this would mean that the court can strike down a provision for inconsistency with natural justice even if it satisfies the rational nexus test under Article 12(1) of the Constitution. It will also be hard to ascertain the limits of judicial power. However, the view has been expressed that such judicial activism would merely be the judiciary exercising its proper role. Furthermore, a judicial inquiry arguably involves both substantive and <b>procedural</b> <b>aspects,</b> so both concepts require no differentiation.|$|E

40|$|Proponents of {{the rule}} of law argue about whether that ideal should be {{conceived}} formalistically or in terms of substantive values. Formalistically, the rule of law is associated with principles like generality, clarity, prospectivity, consistency, etc. Substantively, it is associated with market values, with constitutional rights, and with freedom and human dignity. In this paper, I argue for a third layer of complexity: the <b>procedural</b> <b>aspect</b> {{of the rule}} of law; the aspects of rule-of-law requirements that have to do with 2 ̆ 2 natural Justice 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 procedural due process. 2 ̆ 2 These I believe have been neglected in the jurisprudential literature devoted specifically to the idea {{of the rule of}} law and they deserve much greater emphasis. Moreover procedural values go beyond elementary principles like the guarantee of an unbiased tribunal or the opportunity to present and confront evidence. They include the right to argue in a court about what the law is and what its bearing should be on one 2 ̆ 7 s situation. The provision that law makes for argument is necessarily unsettling, and so this emphasis on the <b>procedural</b> <b>aspect</b> highlights the point predictability should not be regarded as the be-all and end-all {{of the rule of law}}...|$|R
