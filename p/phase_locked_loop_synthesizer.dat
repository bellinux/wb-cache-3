A dual-modulus prescaler is one that has the ability to selectively divide the input frequency by one of two (normally consecutive) integers, such as 32 and 33.

They pose, however, many challenges in the verification of the overall system due to their complex behaviors and expensive consumption of simulation resources. Besides functionality, AMS systems also suffer from stochastic processes such as random noise which exhibits statistical properties. Among many developed verification techniques, runtime verification has been shown to be effective by experimenting finite executions instead of going through the whole state space. In this thesis, we propose a methodology for the verification of AMS designs using functional and statistical runtime verification. Functional runtime verification is used to check the functional behavior of the AMS design. A system of recurrence equation (SRE) is used to model the AMS design and construct a functional property monitor. This functional runtime verification is carried out in an online fashion. Statistical runtime verification is used to verify the statistical properties of the AMS design. Hypothesis test, which is a method to make statistical decisions about rejecting or accepting some statement about the information of a sample, is used to verify the statistical properties.

A modular approach was selected for the laboratory course, which consisted of chipset subsystems, discrete components, and parts of our own design. After each module was designed and tested, they were integrated for system evaluation as a transmitter or a receiver. The key parameters in the system can be conveniently controlled to demonstrate their significance for the system. For the transmitter arrangement, the FM or FSK modulated signal is upconverted to 900 MHz by a programmable frequency synthesizer, which was also used as the local oscillator for the receiver system. The output signal was amplified to about 0 dBm, which is the FCC limit of the transmitted power for this band. The RF receiver block diagram was a dual conversion design, since most modern cordless phones and wireless systems use the same arrangement. The first down conversion was to produce a relatively high intermediate frequency (IF) at 86. 8 MHz. The second IF was at 10. 7 MHz. The system was used to demodulate both FM and FSK signals.

In software deffned radio and cognitive radio, {{one of the most}} critical RF blocks that need to exhibit frequency agility is the <b>phase</b> <b>lock</b> <b>loop</b> (PLL) frequency <b>synthesizer.</b> In order to access various standards, the frequency synthesizer needs to have wide frequency tuning range, fast tuning speed, and low phase noise and frequency spur. The traditional analog charge pump frequency synthesizer circuit design is becoming diffcult due to the continuous down-scalings of transistor feature size and power supply voltage. The goal of this project was to develop an all digital <b>phase</b> <b>locked</b> <b>loop</b> (ADPLL) as the alternative solution technique in RF transceivers by taking advantage of digital circuitry 2 ̆ 7 s characteristic features of good scalability, robustness against process variation and high noise margin.

Not only should they be low power devices, but a wide “Locking Range” (LR) is also desired. The LR is the bandwidth of signals that a Frequency Divider is capable of dividing. As such, this thesis documents the design and analysis of two ILFDs: a Tail-ILFD and a Quench-ILFD. Both of these ILFDs are implemented on the same oscillator circuit, which consumes 2. 28 mW, nominally. Measurements of the Tail and Quench-ILFDs’ LRs are plotted, including one representing the Quench-ILFD operating at “very low” power. Also, an RFD is detailed in this thesis, which consumes 410 μW. This thesis documents Locking Ranges for the Tail and Quench-ILFDs of 12 % and 3. 7 % of 6. 4 GHz respectively, during nominal operation. In “very low” power mode, the Quench-ILFD has a LR of 4. 8 % while consuming 219. 6 μW of power. For the RFD, simulations report a LR of 16. 7 % while consuming 410 μW. Recently in 2011, a wideband LNA topology by Nozahi et al., which employs Partial Noise Cancelling (PNC) of the thermal noise generated by active devices, was presented and claimed to achieve a minimum and maximum NF of 1. 4 dB and 1. 7 dB (from 100 MHz to 2. 3 GHz), while consuming 18 mW from a 1. 8 V supply. This thesis details the theory, design, and simulation results of a narrowband version of this PNC LNA. In order to compare the largesignal performance of this narrowband LNA to that of a well-known implementation, an LNA employing inductive source-degeneration (referred to as a “S-L LNA”) is designed and analyzed through simulation. The PNC LNA operates at a frequency of 2. 3 GHz while the S-L LNA operates at 2. 8 GHz. Simulations report a NF of 1. 76 dB for the PNC LNA and 2. 3 dB for the SL LNA, at their respective operating frequencies. Both LNAs consume roughly 15 mW of quiescent power from a 1. 8 V supply. Lastly, a case for the suspected design and layout faults, which caused fabricated versions of the RFD and two LNAs documented in this thesis to fail, is presented. First, measurements of the two LNAs are shown, which display the input impedance of the S-L LNA and the s₂₁ responses for both.

These requirements and performance are then compared to the hardware evaluation and software simulated findings retrieved from the evaluation board and its simulation software as well as from all other designs. Finally, from the outcome of these comparisons, it is able to conclude which designs {{are likely to be more}} suitable for future 3 G mobile systems. Moreover, with this project, apart from giving the student a chance to predict the requirements for future 3 G system and verified them in the near future, it also helps to create a good learning experience to any students who are very new to frequency synthesizer system but very much interested in getting to know its performance and how it actually functions. For the first stage of the project, researches on both the current and future 3 G requirements are carried out. At the same time, research on suitable frequency synthesizer techniques and evaluation boards are also conducted. With all the important parameters collected from the researches done for both the current and future 3 G requirements, it can then be used as an input criteria in selecting a suitable PLL frequency synthesizer evaluation board from the available market for future 3 G applications. Following the first stage, the second stage will includes hardware evaluation and software simulation on the suitable PLL frequency synthesizer evaluation board bought from Analog Devices Pte Ltd. However, due to some unforeseen circumstances, the hardware evaluation on the evaluation board is unable to carried out smoothly with all the important parameters required for future 3 G applications measured as planned, thus another method to retrieve the values of these important parameters has been suggested.

To handle the frequency drift normally associated with open-loop implementations, a low-leakage charge-pump is proposed. The synthesizer is implemented using a 0. 18 μm CMOS process. Total power consumption is 9 mW and the circuit area including the VCO inductors and on-chip loopfilter is 0. 32 mm 2. Measured leakage current is less than 2 fA. A small area amplitude detector circuit is proposed. The wide-band operation and small input capacitance make the circuit suitable for embedding in an RF system on-chip, allowing measurement of on-chip signal levels and automatic calibration. Finally an oscillator topology reducing the phase noise in voltage controlled oscillators is suggested. By using on-chip decoupling and an amplitude control circuit to adjust oscillator bias, the impact of current source noise is eliminated. The theoretical phase noise is reduced 3. 9 dB compared to a conventional LC oscillator using the same bias current. QC 2010081...|$|R

40|$|This Master Thesis {{concerns}} {{theoretical and}} numerical investigations of optical clock recovery based on <b>phase</b> <b>locked</b> <b>loops</b> at a bit rate of 160 Gb/s. A detailed mathematical {{model of a}} balanced optoelectronic <b>phase</b> <b>locked</b> <b>loop</b> is described and a general time domain non-linear differential equation is derived. Based on the non-linear differential equation, numerical simulations are used to investigate {{the performance of a}} clock recovery circuit. Three loop filter types are considered: a proportional integrator, a low pass filter and an active lag filter. Furthermore, by performing a small signal analysis, simple expressions governing the stability properties and synchronization time constants are derived. In particular, these expressions point out the important effect of a time delay in the loop on the dynamic behavior. Long time delays degrade the performance of the loop and it is analyzed how the limitations due to the time delay can be minimized. Some of the conclusions of the investigations presented here are not anticipated by the classic theory of <b>phase</b> <b>locked</b> <b>loops</b> and allow therefore {{a better understanding of the}} detailed characteristics of optoelectronic <b>phase</b> <b>locked</b> <b>loops.</b> The optoelectronic <b>phase</b> <b>locked</b> <b>loop</b> with an active lag filter results in a minimized synchronization time when there is no time delay in the loop. However, in the presence of time delay, the optoelectronic <b>phase</b> <b>locked</b> <b>loop</b> with a proportional integrator results in a maximized allowed value of the time delay in the loop. Based on the results obtained, guidelines for the implementation of an optimized clock recovery circuit based on the balanced optoelectronic <b>phase</b> <b>locked</b> <b>loop</b> are given...|$|R
