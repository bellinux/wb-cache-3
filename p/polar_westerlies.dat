50|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance formed on January 11 {{to the east}} of St. Brandon, having originated from a circulation that became evident the previous day. It moved to the southwest and gradually intensified, becoming a tropical storm on January 13. That day, the JTWC classified it as Tropical Cyclone 08S, and the Meteorological Service of Madagascar named it Calidera. By January 14, the storm intensified to attain peak winds of 115 km/h (70 mph), just shy of tropical cyclone status. Early on January 15, Calidera made landfall along Cape Masoala in eastern Madagascar at peak intensity. The JTWC assessed that the storm intensified to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane with 1 minute winds of 120 km/h (75 mph). Calidera quickly weakened over land as it crossed the country. It approached the coast near Morondava, although it remained over land and turned more to the south. The system emerged into the Mozambique Channel on January 19 as it turned to the south and southeast. On January 21, Calidera dissipated within the <b>polar</b> <b>westerlies.</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} 24 h {{mesoscale}} simulations (of 10 km horizontal and 400 m vertical resolution) are performed {{to examine the}} characteristics and forcing of gravity waves (GWs) relative to planetary waves (PWs) during the 2008 - 2009 major stratospheric sudden wam 1 ing (SSW). Just prior to SSW occurrence, widespread westward propagating GWs are found along the vortex's edge and associated predominantly with major topographical features and strong near-surface winds. Momentum forcing due to GWs surpasses PW forcing in the upper stratosphere and tends to decelerate the <b>polar</b> <b>westerly</b> jet in excess of 30 m/s/d. With SSW onset, PWs dominate the momentum forcing, providing decelerative effects in excess of 50 m/s/d throughout the upper polar stratosphere. GWs related to topography become less widespread largely due to incipient wind reversal as the vortex starts to elongate. During the SSW maturation and early recovery, the polar vortex eventually splits and both wave signatures and forcing greatly subside. Nonetheless, during SSW, westward and eastward propagating GWs {{are found in the}} polar region and may be generated in situ by flow adjustment processes in the stratosphere or by secondary GW breaking. The simulated large-scale features agree well with those resolved in satellite observations and analysis products...|$|R

40|$|The {{progression}} of the planetary waves as reflected in 30 -day mean charts at 700 mb that had been occurring during September (Posey, 1968) continued in many areas through October. The mean trough in the Gulf of Alaska intensified further {{and moved to a}} position near 145 OW (fig. 1). The ridge which had been new the west coast during September progressed to the favored location near the Continental Divide, while the mean trough remained with little change near the Mississippi Valley. The unusually strong closed Lorn south of Iceland deepened further during October while moving slightly southward and phasing with an eastward-moving trough at lower latitudes near longitude 35 "W. Blocking, which has been prevalent at high latitudes of the Western Hemisphere for several months, continued during October and became even stronger (figs. 2, 3). Heights at 700 mb were as much as 113 m above normal over the Davis Strait area, while the deep Low south of Iceland produced a 700 -mb anomaly of 140 m below normal.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{identified}} {{an association between}} near-surface temperature anomalies in the Northern Hemisphere and weak stratospheric <b>polar</b> <b>westerlies.</b> Large regions in northern Asia, Europe and North America {{have been found to}} cool in the mature and late stages of stratospheric weak vortex events. A substantial part of the temperature changes are associated with changes to the tropospheric Northern Annular Mode and North Atlantic Oscillation pressure patterns. The apparent coupling between the stratosphere and the troposphere may be of relevance for weather forecasting, but only if the temporal and spatial nature of the coupling is known. Here we show, using 51 winters of re-analysis data, that the tropospheric temperature development relative to stratospheric weak polar vortex events goes through a series of well-defined stages, including geographically distinct cold air outbreaks. At the inception of weak vortex events, a precursor signal {{in the form of a}} strong high-pressure anomaly is found over Northwest Europe. At the same time, long-lived and robust cold anomalies appear over Asia and Western Europe. A few weeks later, near the mature stage of weak vortex events, a shorter-lived cold anomaly emerges off the east coast of North America. The probability of cold air outbreaks in different phases of the weak vortex life cycle increases by 40 - 70 % in four key regions. This shows that the stratospheric polar vortex contains information that can be used to enhance forecasts of cold air outbreaks. 300 -year pre-industrial control runs of 11 state-of-the-art coupled climate models corroborate our results.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of subtropical cyclones over the central North Pacific Ocean {{has a significant}} impact on Hawaii’s weather and climate. In this study, 70 upper-level lows that formed during the period 1980 – 2002 are documented. In each case the low became cut off from the <b>polar</b> <b>westerlies</b> south of 30 °N over the central Pacific, during the Hawaiian cool season (October–April). The objectives of this research are to document the interannual variability in the {{occurrence of}} upper-level lows, to chart the locations of their genesis and their tracks, and to investigate the physical mechanisms important in associated surface devel-opment. Significant interannual variability in the occurrence of upper-level lows was found, with evidence suggesting the influence of strong El Niño–Southern Oscillation events on the frequency of subtropical cyclogenesis in this region. Of the 70 upper-level lows, 43 were accompanied by surface cyclogenesis and classified as kona lows. Kona low formation is concentrated to the west-northwest of Hawaii, especially during October and November, whereas lows without surface development are concentrated in the area to the east-northeast of Hawaii. Kona low genesis shifts eastward through the cool season, favoring the area to the east-northeast of Hawaii during February and March, consistent with a shift in the climatological position of the trough aloft during the cool season. Consistent with earlier studies, surface deepening is well correlated with positive vorticity advection by the thermal wind. Static stability and advection of low-level moisture are less well correlated to surface deepening. These results suggest that kona low formation, to first order, is a baroclinic instability that originates in the midlatitudes, and that convection and latent-heat release play a secondary role in surface cyclogenesis. 1...|$|E

40|$|Recently {{considerable}} {{trends in}} ozone concentration with positive values {{mainly in the}} upper troposphere, and decreasing concentrations in the lowerstratosphere of the Northern Hemisphere middle and high latitudes were shown (WMO, 1992). The data basis consists approximately of 15 to 20 years of observations at various locations. These changes are discussed on the background of observed variations of temperature and circulation during the last decades. The observed increased lower stratospheric high latitude westerlies {{are part of a}} natural coupled mode of lower stratospheric and tropospheric circulation. This coupled mode has its strongest tropospheric effects over the North Atlantic with increased westerlies, and positive air temperature anomalies over Scandinavia and Siberia. The intensity of the part of this natural coupled mode which is associate with enhanced <b>polar</b> stratospheric <b>westerlies</b> has increased during the last decades. A primary contribution to this intensification due to the low latitude greenhouse-gas effects is suggested. The observed ozone trends when introduced into a general circulation model do not produce substantial changes in circulation supporting the initial greenhouse gas effects. Concluding, a comprehensive climate model including atmospheric chemistry in combination with a good representation of the whole stratosphere is needed to study future climated scenarios. Most possibly greenhouse-gas effects and ozone concentration are not independent. (orig.)

These departures are extremely large for a summer month. During a hot spell in the Far West on August 9 - 11, record daily maxima for August, including some for any month, were established at numerous stations from central California to central Washing ton. It was the driest August of record {{at a number of}} stations in the Central and Northern Great Plains and the wettest at others in Texas.

40|$|We {{measured}} delta D {{values of}} long chain n-alkanes isolated from 30 surface soil samples along two elevation transects on the Tibetan Plateau differing in precipitation regime and water source. The East Asian Monsoon precipitation dominates the wetter regime {{on the eastern}} slope (from 1230 to 4300 m) of Gongga Shan on the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Precipitation from the <b>Polar</b> <b>Westerlies</b> dominates the drier region on the slope from 1900 to 5000 m in the West Kunlun Shan on the northwestern Tibetan Plateau. The decrease in delta D value with elevation in the wetter region greatly exceeded that in drier region by, - 1. 9 +/- 0. 1 parts per thousand/ 100 m and - 1. 4 +/- 1. 0 parts per thousand/ 100 m respectively. The apparent fractionation between leaf wax and precipitation epsilon(wax-p) values in the wetter region (ca. - 164 parts per thousand) were more negative than those in drier region (ca. - 125 parts per thousand above 3200 m). We also measured delta D values in leaves of six common living trees (values from - 287 parts per thousand to - 193 parts per thousand) from Gongga Shan, ranging from about 2900 - 4200 m. The abundance-weighted average values of the n-alkanes (delta D(wax)) show a strong reverse correlation with sample source elevation (R(2) 0. 78 for soils from Gongga Shan; R(2) 0. 85 for soils from West Kunlun Shan above 3200 m), suggesting that n-alkane delta D(wax) faithfully records the precipitation delta D and that the isotopic altitude effect of precipitation controls delta D(wax) altitudinal gradients in the mountains. The data show a fairly strong monotonic dependency of n-alkane delta D values on elevation for the eastern Plateau, but a complex relationship between n-alkane delta D values and elevation for the northwestern Plateau. The delta D(wax) values at sites below 3200 m from the Kunlun Shan area exhibit an unexpected positive correlation with elevation. The study confirms the potential for using sediment delta D(wax) values to reconstruct paleo-elevation in wetter regions, but suggests caution in applying the approach to dry regions. Our results also show {{it is essential to}} consider the intricacy of the pattern of atmospheric circulation and water sources and their influence on the lapse rate of delta D values with elevation.

5|$|Together {{with the}} trade winds, the {{westerlies}} enabled a round-trip trade route for sailing ships crossing the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, as the westerlies {{lead to the}} development of strong ocean currents on the western sides of oceans in both hemispheres through the process of western intensification. These western ocean currents transport warm, sub tropical water polewards toward the <b>polar</b> regions. The <b>westerlies</b> can be particularly strong, especially in the southern hemisphere, where there is less land in the middle latitudes to cause the flow pattern to amplify, which slows the winds down. The strongest westerly winds in the middle latitudes are within a band known as the Roaring Forties, between 40 and 50degrees latitude south of the equator. The Westerlies {{play an important role in}} carrying the warm, equatorial waters and winds to the western coasts of continents, especially in the southern hemisphere because of its vast oceanic expanse.|$|R
50|$|Hudson Plains has short mild {{summers and}} long harsh winters. It is {{considered}} a continental climate. There is little opportunity to grow food because of the short growing season that is only around 110 days each year and the cold weather. The mean annual temperatures range from -7 degrees Celsius to -2 degrees Celsius. The annual precipitation ranges from around 400-800mm. The climate here is strongly influenced by the cold Hudson Bay low-pressured and polar high-pressure air masses. The climate depends largely on the water surface during {{certain parts of the}} year. In the winter months the bay is covered almost entirely by pack ice and this keeps the air chilled and thus temperatures stay consistently low. Cold, dry arctic air typically lingers over the area throughout winter. Gust can sometimes become violent, reaching speeds of up to 130 km/h. The ice begins melting in May and is almost completely gone by the beginning of June. This brings in the rainy season with an abundance of clouds and fog. After a brief and mild summer the temperatures begin to lower again and rain and snow showers become prominent in October and November. The temperature and precipitation correlate closely with latitude. The predominant global pattern that affects the climate is the polar cell. This system cycles the cool polar easterlies with the <b>polar</b> front <b>westerlies</b> and in doing so creates the cold climate but also allows for a moderate amount of precipitation in the region.|$|R
40|$|The Younger Dryas Stadial (YDS) was {{an episode}} of {{northern}} hemispheric cooling which occurred within the Last Glacial Interglacial Transition (LGIT). A major driver for the YDS climate was a weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). It has been inferred that the AMOC began to strengthen mid-YDS, producing a bipartite structure of the YDS in records from continental Europe. These records imply that the <b>polar</b> front and <b>westerlies</b> shifted northward, producing a warmer {{second phase of the}} YDS in Europe. Here we present multi-proxy data from the sediments of Lake Suigetsu (Japan), as evidence that a related bi-partition of the YDS also occurred in East Asia. Besides showing {{for the first time that}} the bi-partition was not limited to the North Atlantic/European region, the data also imply a climatic dipole between Europe and East Asia since the cold-warm characteristics are reversed at Lake Suigetsu. We suggest that changes in eastward moisture transport from the North Atlantic are the primary mechanism by which the teleconnection can be explained. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In this paper, the {{temporal}} variation {{characteristics of the}} dust storm in North China are investigated. Based on power spectrum analysis and wavelet analysis, 1956 － 1970 and 1985 － 1999 are chosen as the high-frequency and low-frequency dust storm decades respectively. Analysis results clearly show that the spring and wintertime anomalous atmospheric circulation between these two dec-ades are significantly different. Compared with the former decade, there are a strengthened <b>polar</b> vortex, enhanced <b>westerlies</b> near 50 °N, and a weak East Asian major though {{in the winter of}} the latter decade. The north and center parts of the Siberian high and the Aleutian low become weak. The southerly and easterly wind anomalies appear over the north and east parts of China, which implies the weakening of East Asian winter monsoon. Meanwhile, northern China experiences warmer winters and wetter springs, which are in favor of the weakening of dust storm intensity in North China. There are significant out-of-phase relationships between dust frequency and wintertime westerly intensity, as well as between dust frequency and Arctic Oscillation. It is also found that the frequency of dust weather is strongly re-lated to winter-springtime East Asian monsoon intensity...|$|R
40|$|The {{atmosphere}} displays {{modes of}} variability whose structures exhibit a strong longitudinally symmetric (annular) component that {{extends from the}} surface to the stratosphere in middle and high latitudes of both hemispheres. In the past 30 years, these modes have exhibited trends that seem larger than their natural background variability, and {{may be related to}} human influences on stratospheric ozone and/or atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. The pattern of climate trends during the past few decades is marked by rapid cooling and ozone depletion in the polar lower stratosphere of both hemispheres, coupled with an increasing strength of the wintertime <b>westerly</b> <b>polar</b> vortex and a poleward shift of the westerly wind belt at the earth's surface. Annular modes of variability are fundamentally a result of internal dynamical feedbacks within the climate system, and as such can show a large response to rather modest external forcing. The dynamics and thermodynamics of these modes are such that strong synergistic interactions between stratospheric ozone depletion and greenhouse warming are possible. These interactions may be responsible for the pronounced changes in tropospheric and stratospheric climate observed during the past few decades. If these trends continue, they could have important implications for the climate of the 21 st century...|$|R
40|$|Between {{late fall}} and early spring, Mars' middle- and high-latitude {{atmosphere}} supports strong mean equator-to-pole temperature contrasts and an accompanying mean <b>westerly</b> <b>polar</b> vortex. Observations {{from both the}} MGS Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) and the MRO Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) indicate that a mean baroclinicity-barotropicity supports intense, large-scale eastward traveling weather systems (i. e., transient synoptic-period waves). Such extratropical weather disturbances are critical components of the global circulation as they serve as agents in the transport of heat and momentum, and generalized scalar/tracer quantities (e. g., atmospheric dust, water-vapor and ice clouds). The character of such traveling extratropical synoptic disturbances in Mars' southern hemisphere during late winter through early spring is investigated using a moderately high-resolution Mars global climate model (Mars GCM). This Mars GCM imposes interactively-lifted and radiatively-active dust based on a threshold value of the surface stress. The model exhibits a reasonable "dust cycle" (i. e., globally averaged, a dustier atmosphere during southern spring and summer occurs). Compared to the northern-hemisphere counterparts, the southern synoptic-period weather disturbances and accompanying frontal waves have smaller meridional and zonal scales, and are far less intense. Influences of the zonally asymmetric (i. e., east-west varying) topography on southern large-scale weather are investigated, in addition to large-scale up-slope/down-slope flows and the diurnal cycle. A southern storm zone in late winter and early spring presents {{in the western hemisphere}} via orographic influences from the Tharsis highlands, and the Argyre and Hellas impact basins. Geographically localized transient-wave activity diagnostics are constructed that illuminate dynamical differences amongst the simulations and these are presented...|$|R
40|$|The wintertime Northern Hemisphere (NH) {{atmospheric}} circulation {{response to current}} (2007 – 12) and projected (2080 – 99) Arctic sea ice decline is examined with {{the latest version of}} the Community Atmospheric Model (CAM 5). The numerical experiments suggest that the current sea ice conditions force a remote atmospheric response in late winter that favors cold land surface temperatures over midlatitudes, as has been observed in recent years. Anomalous Rossby waves forced by the sea ice anomalies penetrate into the stratosphere in February and weaken the stratospheric polar vortex, resulting in negative anomalies of the northern annular mode (NAM) that propagate downward during the following weeks, especially over the North Pacific. The seasonality of the response is attributed to timing of the phasing between the forced and climatological waves. When sea ice concentration taken from projections of conditions {{at the end of the}} twenty-first century is prescribed to the model, negative anomalies of the NAM are visible in the troposphere, both in early and late winter. This response is mainly driven by the large warming of the lower troposphere over the Arctic, as little impact is found in the stratosphere in this experiment. As a result of the thermal expansion of the <b>polar</b> troposphere, the <b>westerly</b> flow is decelerated and a weak but statistically significant increase of the midlatitude meanders is identified. However, the thermodynamical response extends beyond the Arctic and offsets the dynamical effect, such that the stronger sea ice forcing has limited impact on the intensity of cold extremes over midlatitudes...|$|R
