40|$|In paper-based {{workflow}} systems, {{signatures of}} {{individuals or groups}} {{of people have been}} used extensively for different <b>purposes.</b> Currently there are numerous studies on computerizing workflow systems. Also there are studies on implementing digital signatures in electronic media. But the diversified <b>purposes</b> of a signature in workflow makes a straightforward implementation of digital signature schemes inadequate. There are few studies on the implication of different signature <b>purposes</b> on electronic workflow systems. The <b>purposes</b> of signature are closely associated with the two modes of decision making, namely single and group. These two modes of decision making in turn lead to single and group signatures. This paper reports our comprehensive studies on signature <b>purposes.</b> These include the analysis of common signature <b>purposes</b> in workflow, classification of these <b>purposes,</b> classification of modes of decision making associated with these signature <b>purposes,</b> signing and validation requirements for handling these signature <b>purposes,</b> and finally an architecture to be incorporated in workflow engines for handling these signature <b>purposes.</b> In summary, this paper addresses a commonly neglected problem in information systems research: management control by signature in workflow. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
5|$|The basic {{principle}} that is applied {{by the courts}} is that where statute grants a power to a decision-maker for <b>purpose</b> A, it is unlawful for the decision-maker to exercise the power for <b>purpose</b> B, because the decision-maker would be using the power for an unauthorized <b>purpose.</b>|$|E

5|$|The special <b>purpose</b> {{entities}} {{were used}} {{for more than just}} circumventing accounting conventions. As a result of one violation, Enron's balance sheet understated its liabilities and overstated its equity, and its earnings were overstated. Enron disclosed to its shareholders that it had hedged downside risk in its own illiquid investments using special <b>purpose</b> entities. However, investors were oblivious {{to the fact that the}} special <b>purpose</b> entities were actually using the company's own stock and financial guarantees to finance these hedges. This prevented Enron from being protected from the downside risk. Notable examples of special <b>purpose</b> entities that Enron employed were JEDI, Chewco, Whitewing, and LJM.|$|E

5|$|Because Irenaeus saw the <b>purpose</b> of {{the world}} to be the {{development}} of the moral character of humans, he believed that a good world would be best suited to that <b>purpose.</b> Irenaeaus believed that this world would include some suffering and evil to help people draw closer to God. He perceived God's declaration in the Book of Genesis that his creation was good to mean that the world is fit for <b>purpose,</b> rather than being free from suffering. To illustrate the benefits of suffering, Irenaeus cited the Biblical example of Jonah, from the Book of Jonah. His suffering, being swallowed by a whale, both enabled God's plan to be fulfilled and also brought Jonah closer to God: Jonah ended up repenting for his sin and the people of Nineveh turn to God.|$|E
