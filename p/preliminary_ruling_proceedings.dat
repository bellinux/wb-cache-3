40|$|For years, the Court of Justice of the European Union {{has been}} {{overloaded}} with requests for preliminary rulings, given that these proceedings make {{up more than}} three-quarters of the Court caseload. Such circumstances constitute a significant constraint to the operation of the Court, which is unable to quickly and effectively respond to the preliminary questions which are referred to this Court by the national courts of Member States. In addition, the duration of the regular <b>preliminary</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>proceedings</b> jeopardizes the European standards {{not only in terms of}} the lengthy procedure but also in terms of observing the right of each individual to effective judicial protection within a reasonable time. In order to make the proceedings faster and more effective, the procedural rules have been repeatedly amended and supplemented. The applicable Rules of Procedure of the Court stipulate some exceptions from the regular preliminary ruling procedure. The first one is the so-called simplified procedure, where the Court renders a final decision in the form of a reasoned order, without scheduling an oral hearing and obtaining the written opinion of the Advocate-General. The Court may also decide to institute the expedited procedure, by means of which the case at issue is given absolute priority over other cases. The last exception is the urgent procedure, which is applicable only in the area of freedom, security and justice; it implies the omission of certain stages of the regular preliminary ruling procedure. The analyses presented in this paper show that the results achieved in terms of reducing the length of the regular preliminary ruling procedure are generally positive. Thus, the average time required for rendering a decision in the expedited procedure is approximately four and a half months, which is certainly a significant improvement as compared to the length of the regular procedure which takes sixteen to seventeen months. The initial results accomplished by instituting the urgent procedure are even more encouraging, as the average duration of this procedure is approximately two months. The time required for deliberation in an urgent procedure has never exceeded three months, which makes this procedure faster and more efficient than the expedited procedure...|$|E

Aktualios Europos Sąjungos Teisingumo Teismo jurisprudencijos analizė turi padėti atskleisti ir galimas jos raidos tendencijas. The article {{analyses}} {{the changes}} of {{jurisdiction of the}} Court of Justice of the European Union after the coming into force of the Treaty of Lisbon to give preliminary rulings in the proceedings launched where a national court submits a reference for preliminary ruling when considering a criminal matter {{as well as on}} a request from a national court to interpret a legal act of the European Union or deliver an opinion on its validity. In addition, it investigates the preliminary ruling, the requirements to fulfil when presenting procedural documents, and conditions of applying special measures in organizing the proceedings. The analysis of the relevant case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union will also help to reflect the potential trends of its future development. On the basis of the analysis of the case-law of the Court of Justice, the following conclusion is made: after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and expiry of the transitional period, no restrictions have been left for national courts (irrespective of their position in the national legislative system) to submit a reference for a preliminary ruling before the Court of Justice of the European Union where preliminary questions are related to the area of freedom, security and justice, therefore, the following trend arises: national courts more often decide to use this opportunity of cooperation with the Court also when a criminal case is pending before a national court. In the process of a preliminary ruling the role of a national court is very important, as it, requesting for a preliminary ruling, not only initiates the opening of the process, but also the quality of procedural documents submitted by a referring court may determine the progress, duration and result of the proceedings. Therefore, the requirements and stipulations laid down accordingly in Article 94 of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice and Recommendations to national courts in relation to the initiation of <b>preliminary</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>proceedings</b> are very important. An active use of national courts of a possibility to submit a reference for a preliminary ruling to the Court of Justice in cases where there are doubts as regards interpretation of the European Union legal acts in considering criminal cases and the preliminary rulings of the Court of Justice contributes to the attaining of one of the main objectives laid down in Article 267 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union: to ensure uniform interpretation and application of the European Union law throughout the Union...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} the case law and the {{legislative}} activity concerning electronic platforms have taken off considerably in Italy. Relevant problems and questions continue to arise not only concerning private law issues, but also regarding competition and public law, {{as well as several}} aspects of administrative law and tax regulation. In particular, if on the one hand in recent years Italian courts have been dealing with electronic platforms prevalently in a business-to-business perspective – mainly by analysing competition, administrative and tax law issues – on the other hand the Italian Competition Authority (hereinafter: AGCM) and administrative judges set a specific focus on business-to-consumer relationships. They carry out a fairness control of the behaviour of platforms that convey misleading information to consumers, created by other individuals or entities. In this context, an analysis of the activity of the AGCM {{as well as of the}} administrative courts concerning the liability of rating websites, with specific regard to Tripadvisor, reveals several interesting aspects. Particularly remarkable in a systematic perspective is the circumstance that both the AGCM and the Tribunale Amministrativo Regionale per il Lazio (hereinafter: TAR) qualified Tripadvisor as a ‘trader’ according to Art 18, Para 1, lett b), Codice del consumo, which implements Art 2, Para 1, lett b) of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive (hereinafter: UCP Directive), rather than as a service provider acting as a host in the sense of Directive 2000 / 31 /EC (hereinafter: E-Commerce Directive), as was alleged by the online platform. Most recently, in 2015 a debate arose concerning the platform Uber and in particular UberPop, services which also gave rise to a number of court claims in Italy. Uber has actually been the subject matter of significant case law, as well as legislative activity. Concerning these issues, in particular the AGCM as well as – most recently – the Consiglio di Stato showed to be strongly in favour of the introduction of a comprehensive regulation dealing with the platform service provided by Uber. It is therefore interesting to examine the Italian experience with this topic. An examination of relevant issues could also be useful in order to better understand the elements of the <b>preliminary</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>proceedings</b> pending before the European Court of Justice (CJEU). In the context of the cases here described, Italian courts dealt also with contract law issues, trying to answer to the question if Uber should be considered an intermediary, one of the contractual parties in a multilateral contract, or the counterparty (respectively of the driver and of the customer) of two distinct contracts. In this regard, in a position paper published on 29 th September 2015, the Italian competition authority AGCM—also taking into consideration the request for a preliminary ruling recently submitted to the European Court of Justice in the case of Uber System Spain—classified an agreement concluded by means of the app UberPop as an electronic intermediary service or an information society service, as defined by Art 1, para 2 of Directive 98 / 34 /EC on Information Society services, rather than as a ‘transport contract’. Most recently, in an opinion of the 23 rd December 2015, the Consiglio di Stato tried to properly qualify the ‘new’ contractual relationships arising from the Uber platform and other, similar platforms offering taxi services. In the opinion of the highest Italian administrative court, these ‘new’ contractual relationships are fundamentally different from those currently regulated under existing law. Indeed, Uber and similar platforms do not merely offer a transport service but also further ‘innovative complementary services’, which sensibly modify the contractual scheme. This contribution discusses therefore the Italian case law concerning online platforms, the legislative activities in this area and the further debate on this topic. It concludes with some thoughts on whether the existing Italian law is able to provide adequate solutions to the current challenges concerning online platforms...|$|E

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the issue of {{interpretation}} of European law. It is based on the classical methodology of law interpretation in continental Europe, but it also reflects the particularities and recent approaches, which are used in European law as in independent and particular legal system. So it is essential to emphasize the autonomous conception of European law, which finally means its own methodology which is different from national attitudes. By practice of European bodies and mainly by judgments of Court of Justice of European Union was established specific set of rules which corresponds to peculiarities of European Union as an integrative society. The Court of Justice formulated in its decision two basic principles for the application of the European law in the Member States: the principle of direct effect of the European law in the Member States and the principle of the primacy of the European law rules in the national legal rules of the Member States. There should be further assigned to these two basic principles the principle of indirect effect of directives (uniform interpretation) and the principle of State liability for damage caused to an individual by breach of the European law. The application of principles of direct effect and primacy of the European law rules is closely related to the <b>preliminary</b> <b>ruling</b> procedure (prejudicial <b>proceedings).</b> The judge-made law can be used only by the Court of Justice, neither the administrative bodies of EU nor the national bodies have this capacity...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{significant}} competences of the European Court of Justice is to issue a <b>preliminary</b> <b>ruling</b> on an issue which {{has been referred to}} this Court by the national courts of the EU Member States. In this procedure, the national courts are provided the necessary explanation on the applicable EU law, either through by interpreting some legal provisions or by assessing the validity of a legal act adopted by the EU institutions. The <b>preliminary</b> <b>ruling</b> of the Court of Justice is binding for the national court which referred the issue to the Court. The decision is also binding for all national courts which have jurisdiction to decide on legal remedies in this matter. On the other hand, the effect of the <b>preliminary</b> <b>ruling</b> on other national courts is not quite clear. In other words, there is a dilemma as to whether the <b>preliminary</b> <b>ruling</b> on a disputed issue posed in one proceeding is binding for all other courts, which have not been actually involved in this particular proceeding.

40|$|This {{study is}} a {{follow-up}} to a {{survey conducted by the}} author in the framework of Euro-Comp-Aid, a networking programme co-funded by the European Commission, DG Competition, and directed by the author. Several experts, mainly from National Competition Authorities (NCAs) of the EU Member States, answered a questionnaire drafted by the author of the study. The study reflects on some of the most interesting results of the survey, as to the actual impact of cooperation tools provided for by Article 15 of Regulation 1 / 2003. It also addresses {{the ways in which the}} legal systems of Member States complement Article 15 cooperation tools especially as concerns NCAs. Such national mechanisms of cooperation between courts dealing with private enforcement cases and public enforcement authorities are assessed by taking into account their soundness in the framework of the modernization and decentralization of EU competition law and some concerns about possible inconsistencies with the system designed by Article 267 TFEU. Due account is also taken of the role played by NCA public enforcement findings before civil courts dealing with private enforcement follow-on actions. First of all, the article analyzes the effective role as amicus curiae role played by the German Bundeskartellamt before German courts, stressing on the other side the unsatisfactory consideration German Supreme Court gives to the <b>preliminary</b> <b>ruling</b> mechanism. Then, the French Autorité de la Concurrence position as an amicus curiae is considered, noting in particular the interesting French approach to disclosure of public enforcement files, strictly intertwined with the amicus curiae role of the Authority; another issue which gives interesting hints on a question of general interest in the field, is that of coordination between NCA and Commission's interventions before national Courts. The focus is then on British NCAs role as amici curiae, where the more general question is addressed of the relationship between general courts and specialized competition courts entrusted with judicial review over NCA acts, in light of the decentralized nature of the EU competition law enforcement system, and of the sincere cooperation principle of EU law. Again, as for the German approach, an unsatisfactory consideration of Art. 267 TFEU procedures is observed. The Italian model is then analyzed, based on a strict separation between administrative and judicial functions, which requires a strict reading of the res indicate effect of EC decisions and will eventually make the enactment of the enforcement directive a quite delicate issue. As for the French approach, the usefulness of resorting to general tools of the law of evidence is stressed, instead of relying too much on (not satisfactory) tools of direct cooperation. The position of the Spanish Comisión Nacional de la Competencia in the EU decentralized system of competition law enforcement is then taken into consideration, by stressing not only the active role public enforcement authorities can have before Spanish civil courts, but also the useful assistance they can provide to courts in damage assessment. The complementarity between special EU law cooperation tools, and general tools provided for by national law is then highlighted when it comes to the assessment of the Swedish legal system; at the same time, the analysis of Swedish practice shows the decisive role such cooperation might have in interim proceedings, as well as the risks inherent in such situations. Further, some other Member State legal systems are taken into account, that seem to have gone further than EU law itself in providing for cooperation between civil courts entrusted with private enforcement and public enforcement agencies, by setting some forms of reinforced and even structural connection between the two sides of competition law enforcement. This is the case of Malta, Latvia and Romania. In all of these Member States, a system is put in place, which goes to a certain extent beyond the model of smooth cooperation outlined by Article 15 Regulation 1 / 03. Such approaches might favor the effectiveness of EU competition law enforcement. In some cases, however, the risks arises of compromising the unitary character of EU competition law. The role of <b>preliminary</b> <b>rulings</b> <b>proceedings</b> under art. 267 TFEU remains therefore essential. Czech, Slovakian, Luxembourgish and Bulgarian systems are finally considered. Besides making apparent obvious differences existing among various Member States, the study shows the need for a more comprehensive and coherent approach to cooperation between courts dealing with private enforcement cases and administrative authorities entrusted with public enforcement powers. It also shows the need to preserve the European Court of Justice’s role in ensuring the uniform interpretation of EU competition law, which some national approaches risk jeopardizing...|$|R
