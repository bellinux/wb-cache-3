40|$|Synchytrium endobioticum is {{a severe}} {{pathogen}} of <b>potato</b> causing <b>wart</b> disease. For this obligate fungus many pathotypes exist, which are pathogenic or non-pathogenic to different cultivars of potato. To determine to which pathotype an isolate belongs, two biological assays are {{used on a}} set of different potato cultivars: the Spieckermann and the Glynne-Lemmerzahl test. A differential set of cultivars has been recommended by EPPO (European Plant Protection Organization) for these tests. Drawbacks of these tests are that it can take up to several months to score the interaction and results are difficult to score and also often not conclusive. Therefore, possibilities were investigated to look for molecular markers for pathotype specificity. An extremely low level of diversity was observed in a set of eight isolates using CRoPS™ (Complexity Reduction of Polymorphic Sequences) technology. Only 191 sequence polymorphisms were found in 14, 660 contigs representing approximately 195 Kb of sequence for eight isolates. Nine sequence polymorphisms could be related to pathotype specificity. Two of these polymorphisms were transferred into a real-time TaqMan PCR assay to discriminate between pathotype specific groups. Validation of the assays was performed using multiple isolates from different countries for which the bioassay had been performed. </p...|$|R

40|$|Potatoes {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} crops worldwide. <b>Potato</b> <b>wart</b> disease is major quarantine disease, caused by the Chytridiomycete Synchytrium endobiticum (Shilb.) Perc. The typical symptoms are tumour-like outgrowths arising near meristematic tissues (e. g. buds on tubers). The foci of <b>potato</b> <b>wart</b> disease occur only in the mountainous parts of Bulgaria. The pathogen has been detected in private gardens, or small farms with out crop rotation, which do not share with seed potato production. The prime pathway for spread is trade of potato tubers, which may be infected internally, or may carry adhering soil. The resting spores of S. Endobioticum are able to persist in the soil over 40 years. For infection of potato plants is need soil infection level below 1 sporangium per g soil. First occurrence of pathogen in Turkey, Greece and Bulgaria showed, that the pathogen has well adapted to continental climate. The pathotypes 1 (D 1), 2 (G 1), 6 (O 1) and 18 (T 1) are the most widespread in the EPPO region. National Phytosanitary regulations have been applied in the infected regions, to prevent spread of the fungus. The experimental work for testing of pathotypes and potato cultivars for resistance, was carried out with field tests and Laboratory tests (Spieckermann and Glynne-Lemmerzahl methods), according to Diagnostic protocol of EPPO PM 7 / 28 (1). The Glynne-Lemmerzahl method is based on the infection of young sprouts by zoocpores directly produced by summer sporangia of fresh wart tissue. This method is high reliable and efficient. Pathotypes in the infected regions have been identified with different isolates: Podvis correspond with Nevsehir 1, which is mix of pathotypes 6 (O 1) and 18 (T 1) and isolate Barutin, identical with new pathotype 38 Nevsehir. Based on the results obtained with laboratory tests, it was concluded that the pathotype in the field in Prodanovtsi was probably 8 (F 1). Identified resistant potato varieties to isolate Podvis and Barutin are not commercial significance for Bulgaria.

Because of its {{severity}} and persistence, quarantine {{measures are}} enforced worldwide {{to avoid the}} spread of this disease. Molecular markers exist for species-specific detection of this pathogen, yet markers to study the intraspecific genetic diversity of S. endobioticum were not available. Whole-genome sequence data from Dutch pathotype 1 isolate MB 42 of S. endobioticum were mined for perfect microsatellite motifs. Of the 62 selected microsatellites, 21 could be amplified successfully and displayed moderate levels of polymorphism in 22 S. endobioticum isolates from different countries. Nineteen multilocus genotypes were observed, with only three isolates from Canada displaying identical profiles. The majority of isolates from Canada clustered genetically.

40|$|Synchytrium endobioticum is an obligate biotrophic fungus {{that causes}} wart {{diseases}} in potato. Like {{other species of}} the class Chytridiomycetes, it does not form mycelia and its zoospores are small, approximately 3 μm in diameter, which complicates the detection of early stages of infection. Furthermore, <b>potato</b> <b>wart</b> disease is difficult to control because belowground organs are infected and resting spores of the fungus are extremely durable. Thus, S. endobioticum is classified as a quarantine organism. More than 40 S. endobioticum pathotypes have been reported, of which pathotypes 1 (D 1), 2 (G 1), 6 (O 1), 8 (F 1), and 18 (T 1) {{are the most important}} in Germany. No molecular methods for the differentiation of pathotypes are available to date. In this work, we sequenced both genomic DNA and cDNA of the German pathotype 18 (T 1) from infected potato tissue and generated 5, 422 expressed sequence tags (EST) and 423 genomic contigs. Comparative sequencing of 33 genes, single-stranded confirmation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis with polymerase chain reaction fragments of 27 additional genes, as well as the analysis of 41 simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci revealed extremely low levels of variation among five German pathotypes. From these markers, one sequence-characterized amplified region marker and five SSR markers revealed polymorphisms among the German pathotypes and an extended set of 11 additional European isolates. Pathotypes 8 (F 1) and 18 (T 1) displayed discrete polymorphisms which allow their differentiation from other pathotypes. Overall, using the information of the six markers, the 16 isolates could be differentiated into three distinct genotype groups. In addition to the presented markers, the new collection of EST from genus Synchytrium might serve in the future for molecular taxonomic studies as well as for analyses of the host-pathogen interactions in this difficult pathosystem. © 2017 The American Phytopathological Society...|$|E
40|$|The obligate biotrophic, soil-borne fungus Synchytrium endobioticum causes wart {{disease of}} potato (Solanum tuberosum), {{which is a}} serious problem for crop {{production}} in countries with moderate climates. S. endobioticum induces hypertrophic cell divisions in plant host tissues leading to the formation of tumor-like structures. <b>Potato</b> <b>wart</b> is a quarantine disease and chemical control is not possible. From 38 S. endobioticum pathotypes occurring in Europe, pathotypes 1, 2, 6 and 18 are the most relevant. Genetic resistance to wart is available but only few current potato varieties are resistant to all four pathotypes. The phenotypic evaluation of wart resistance is laborious, time-consuming and sometimes ambiguous, which makes breeding for resistance difficult. Molecular markers diagnostic for genes for resistance to S. endobioticum pathotypes 1, 2, 6 and 18 would greatly facilitate the selection of new, resistant cultivars. Two tetraploid half-sib families (266 individuals) segregating for resistance to S. endobioticum pathotypes 1, 2, 6 and 18 were produced by crossing a resistant genotype with two different susceptible ones. The families were scored for five different wart resistance phenotypes. The distribution of mean resistance scores was quantitative in both families. Resistance to pathotypes 2, 6 and 18 was correlated and independent from resistance to pathotype 1. DNA pools were constructed from the most resistant and most susceptible individuals and screened with genome wide simple sequence repeat (SSR), inverted simple sequence region (ISSR) and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. Bulked segregant analysis identified three SSR markers that were linked to wart resistance loci (Sen). Sen 1 -XI on chromosome XI conferred partial resistance to pathotype 1, Sen 18 -IX on chromosome IX to pathotype 18 and Sen 2 / 6 / 18 -I on chromosome I to pathotypes 2, 6 and 18. Additional genotyping with 191 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers confirmed the localization of the Sen loci. Thirty-three SNP markers linked to the Sen loci permitted the dissection of Sen alleles that increased or decreased resistance to wart. The alleles were inherited from both the resistant and susceptible parents...|$|E
