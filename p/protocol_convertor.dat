40|$|In this paper, {{a number}} of {{mechanisms}} are described {{that can be used}} in the design of a <b>protocol</b> <b>convertor</b> for authentication and key distribution protocols. First, the scope of the mechanisms is defined: we mark out the class of authentication systems that were considered during the design of the mechanisms. A first mechanism, based on proxies and a synchronization protocol, allows for a transparant protocol conversion. It is generic, and can easily be tailored to different specific situations. The second mechanism addresses the problem of the statefulness of the <b>protocol</b> <b>convertor.</b> It can be used to offload state from the convertor to the principals of the interconnected domains, thus making the convertor more robust. Both mechanisms can be used separately or in combination. When properly combined, they provide for a robust, transparant, and safe <b>protocol</b> <b>convertor</b> for authentication and key distribution protocols. Keywords: security, authentication protocols, inter-domain autentica [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedDesigned {{to circumvent the}} incompatibilities between communicating computer systems, a parameterized <b>protocol</b> <b>convertor</b> permits the use of communication equipment supporting variations of the same communication protocol or completely different framing technique protocols. The analysis of the conversion process includes the engineering trade-offs between speed of conversion and flexibility, {{and the use of}} an alternative flow architecture. Flexibility is enhanced through user selection of input and output protocol types, and the designation of functional specifics, such as code type, header length, and error detection methods, with variable parameters. The speed of conversion is increased through the parallel processing of the framing, transparency, and error control sub-functions and the use of a single byte storage technique. The single byte storage technique imposes some limitations in the use of transparent data. [URL] United States Marine Corp...|$|E

It also safeguards the investment of owners of substation automation systems in an environment in which communication technology changes rapidly. Since becoming international standard in 2005, it has increasingly gained acceptance from the utilities and industrial electricity consumers. The success of IEC 61850 owes much to the use of modern Ethernet and flexible communication technologies. The standard enables the fast communications between two or more control/protection devices, as well as more secure communications between a station controller and a control/protection device. Ethernet is the physical medium over which the operation, configuration and management data are exchanged. The physical network comprises switches, optical fibre cables and twisted-pair cables and is electromagnetically compatible with its environment. Experience has shown shorter system set-up time due to the standardised configuration process. User-friendly configuration tools simplify commissioning and data flow information is displayed on devices to assist trouble-shooting. The certification of devices by independent and approved test institutes for conformity to IEC 61850 helps ensure the interoperability of devices from different manufacturers...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} of this Bachelor's thesis is to create I 2 C bus to RS 232 bus {{convertor}}. Using I 2 C bus the convertor drives 8 bit I/O expander. In theoretical part buses I 2 C and RS 232 are described along with PCF 8574. There is also mentioned selection appropriate microcontroler and design of comunication protocol. Practical part is dedicated to creating control program for microcontroler, appropriate comunication <b>protocol</b> processing and <b>convertor</b> testing. There are also described some auxiliary products and program testing...|$|R
