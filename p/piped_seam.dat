50|$|Several {{problems}} with the <b>pipe</b> <b>seam</b> were identified {{as the cause of}} the failure. Hook cracks, extremely low impact toughness, and elongation properties were named for the pipe tested. The low-frequency electric resistance weld (ERW) pipe manufacturing process, used to make this pipe, has been known to have weaknesses with hook cracks and hardness issues.|$|R
25|$|Only one new unit, the Neotank, {{was added}} to the {{original}} set in Advance Wars. Two new terrain features were introduced: the Missile Silo and the Pipeline (along with its breakable <b>Pipe</b> <b>Seams).</b> The Missile Silo can be fired by foot troops to deal area of effect damage, and pipelines act as impassable walls. Because of its function as a wall, players can use it to create maps smaller than the default dimension the map editor provides, something that was not possible in the game's predecessor.|$|R
40|$|A 2 -inch {{schedule}} 40 {{steel core}} pipe in an evaporator overheads discharge line broke at several locations downstream from {{a section of}} the line where it bridges a road. Fish mouth openings that developed along the <b>pipe</b> <b>seams</b> were initiated at lack of fusion defects in the pipe welds. A vacuum created in the piping upstream of the breaks prevented full drainage of the water upon shut down of the pump. Freezing of water in the pipe (the line was not heat traced) and water hammer effects occurring with pump restart could each contribute to the extensive deformation and tearing observed at the breaks. Both the weld flaws and the over pressure contributed to the outcome. All pipe was replaced and a vacuum break was installed to eliminate the problem...|$|R
40|$|This article {{contains}} an overview on automated ultrasonic weld inspection for various pipe types. Some inspection steps might by {{carried out with}} portable test equipment (e. g. pipe end test), but the weld inspection in all internationally relevant specifications must be automated. The pipe geometry, the production process, and the further pipe usage determine if NDT is required and thus, the number of required ultrasonic probes. Recent updates for some test specifications enforce {{a large number of}} ultrasonic probes, e. g. the SHELL standard. To save production cost, seamless pipes are sometimes replaced by ERW (electric-resistance welded) pipes and LSAW (submerged-arc welded <b>pipes</b> with longitudinal <b>seam)</b> <b>pipes</b> by SSAW (submerged-arc welded <b>pipes</b> with spiral <b>seam)</b> <b>pipes,</b> the inspection methods change gradually between the various pipe types. Each testing system is optimized for the specific application and its properties have to be discussed by the system manufacturer, the system user and the final customer of the pipe. The presentation for the WCNDT in Shanghai focuses on three ultrasonic testing systems which were shipped to BAOSTEEL in 2007 and which are currently under installation. Two ECHOGRAPH weld testing systems for large diameter pipes with longitudinal submerged arc weld (LSAW) and one ECHOGRAPH pipe-end testing system enable the pipe mill to inspect their products with hig...|$|R

In the full-dress uniform (grosser Gesellschaftanzug) the Waffenrock was worn with medals, aiguillette (officers), {{trousers}} and shoes, the Schirmmutze, gloves, and sword (officers/senior NCOs) or dress bayonet (enlisted). Parade dress substituted the steel helmet and jackboots. Semi-formal (kleiner Gesellschaftanzug) and walking-out (Ausgangsanzug) uniforms were as full-dress, but without aiguillette and with ribbons replacing medals.|$|R
40|$|Health risks {{during high}} {{pressure}} cleaning {{with a traditional}} cleaner are caused by muscle activity and exposure to vibrations. Exposure to vibrations during cleaning declines when a straight spraying lance is used instead of a bowed spraying lance. An accumulator and a better-balanced rotating nozzle further reduce vibrations. A broad-spraying nozzle hardly vibrates, but its cleaning capacity is insufficient for very dirty areas. Muscle activity can be reduced by using a fingertip handle and a straight spraying lance. The best high pressure cleaning equipment in this study had an accumulator, fingertip handle, straight spraying lance and a better-balanced rotating nozzle. For well soaked farrowing rooms or nursery rooms a broad nozzle can be used. For farms with 300 sows and 2160 finishers annual costs for robot cleaning were ¿ 1170 higher than for manual cleaning. A cleaning robot might be profitable for farms with more than 6750 finishing pigs. However: many assumptions had to be made, since several variables were unknown. Other benefits of robot cleaning are: less unpleasant work and health risks, easier labour organization and better image on the labour-market. Cleanability is affected by layout of the buildings and pens, food composition, feeding regime and material choice. Concrete floors and walls must be smooth. Coatings can make them smoother and keep them smoother, as they protect them against chemical and physical influences. It is easier to clean stainless steel than to clean galvanized metal. Surfaces must be flat and accessible for the water jet. Walls must be solid, without bars or pipes, and round pipes {{are more difficult to}} clean than diamond-shaped <b>pipes.</b> <b>Seams</b> or crack must be avoided or repaired. The cleanability of many components in the pens or in the stable would improve if swing-back constructions were applied...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the metallurgical science {{used to develop}} a new, weldable high-strength linepipe (X 120) for transport of natural gas. A domain based microstructure design {{has been used to}} ensure ductile fracture behavior at temperatures down to- 20 °C. Ultra-refinement involving careful chemistry design and thermo-mechanical controlled processing (TMCP) produced fine domains of less than about 2 µm within prior austenite pancakes of less than about 6 µm in thickness. To achieve the target properties in the <b>pipe</b> body, <b>seam</b> weld, and girth weld heat-affected-zones (HAZ), three low carbon microstructure designs have been produced. Low carbon chemistry and Nb/V microalloying combined with boron additions were used to impart sufficient HAZ cold cracking resistance and limit softening in the seam weld HAZ. Both the lower bainite and the dual phase microstructures provided superior property combinations. KEY WORDS: High strength linepipe; weldable; TMCP; UOE; boron; bainite; dual phase...|$|R
40|$|Abstract 24 ” {{pipeline}} carrying oil was {{failed in}} the form of longitudinal crack at the 6 O’clock position resulting in oil spill. The failed pipe was investigated to reveal the main cause of its failure. The procedure of investigation was built on studying the intact pipe, rupture area, parent material, and intact weld. Results of chemical analysis, mechanical properties, and microstructure of the pipe material were confirmed with the specified standard. Cracks were originated from weld defected sites, initiated by grooving corrosion, propagated by inertia at the normal designed pressure condition, and stopped when stress relief is attained. It is recommended to use high quality ERW <b>pipe,</b> with its <b>seam</b> weld line positioned around the 12 O’clock during installation, to minimize and decelerate grooving corrosion. It is also important to perform regular or routine inspection, on suitable intervals, determined by past experience...|$|R
40|$|Pipeline {{operators}} have {{at their}} disposal multiple resources for evaluating the integrity of identified features and anomalies. With advances in in-line inspection technology, the pipeline industry is being called upon to evaluate an ever-increasing number of features. When a feature is identified as a threat and severe enough to warrant further investigation, operators are faced with sometimes significant costs, including those associated with excavation activities. In this paper the authors provide guidance on the benefits associated with full-scale testing for evaluating mechanical integrity, referred to Intentional Destructive Testing (IDT). Unlike many assessment techniques that require {{the development and implementation}} of assumed operating and boundary conditions, well-designed IDT programs are able to replicate in situ conditions to provide operators with a clear understanding regarding the behavior of pipeline features and anomalies by simulating operating conditions and loading. Three case studies are included in this paper to demonstrate the merits of the IDT approach including the assessment of dents subjected to cyclic pressures, burst testing vintage <b>pipes</b> having long <b>seam</b> weld crack-like features, and evaluating the reinforcement of girth welds using composite materials. In using IDT operators have improved confidence in predicting the behavior of identified features to ensure that maintenance resources are properly allocated for excavating and repairing anomalies...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} problems faced in the geothermal power industry is that of scaling due to amorphous silica. The silica can deposit out of super-saturated brine in monomeric form and as colloidal particles. Deposition can occur at problematic rates on pipe surfaces and in the rocks of the re-injection wells. Currently {{there are a number of}} methods for controlling deposition but the fundamental mechanisms that govern the transport and attachment of silica are not well understood. Many field experiments on silica scaling have been conducted but, due to differences in brine chemistry and operational conditions, the results are hard to compare. Many laboratory experiments have also been performed but these are difficult to correlate with the field experiments. Previous research has found that hydrodynamics are important for the deposition of colloidal particles and inertial impaction was proposed to be the dominant transport mechanism. These results were analysed and, in contradiction, the dominant transport mechanism of the particles was theoretically expected to be that of diffusion. A series of experiments were planned that could test the effect of hydrodynamics on colloidal silica deposition in cylindrical pipe flow. Three parameters were to be varied in the experiment: particle size (10 nm and 100 nm), Reynolds number (750 - 23, 600) and viscous boundary layer thickness (0. 06 - 0. 38 mm). To perform this experimentation, a Silica Scaling Test Rig was designed, built and commissioned. A method for producing synthetic brine was developed which can provide sols that are stable for at least one month and have a particle size of 10 - 20 nm. Silica deposition has successfully been obtained in three preliminary experiments using the rig. Without the exclusion of air from the rig significant corrosion occurs in the mild steel test piece. Protrusions that were likely to be silica deposits were found to be co-located with the corrosion, suggesting that one process promotes the other. Neither deposition nor corrosion was found on the <b>pipe’s</b> weld <b>seam</b> and heat affected zone. Corrosion was prevented using an oxygen exclusion system and two amorphous silica deposition structures were observed: a flat plate-like structure and a globular structure that consisted of 1 - 5 μm diameter globules that built up on each other. Other field and laboratory experiments have produced globular structures similar to those found in this research. To perform the planned experimentation, future work is required: the silica deposition rate must be increased, colloidal silica sol stability must be improved, and some modifications must be made to the rig...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe fatigue {{strength}} of pipe-to-plate welded joints under bending, torsion and combined (in-phase and out-of-phase) bending and torsion has been already investigated in previous {{works by the}} authors. The specimen consisted of a <b>pipe</b> joined by <b>seam</b> welding to a plate. Both the pipe and the plate were made of S 355 JR steel. The test apparatus allows to apply any combination of proportional and non-proportional bending and torsion loads to the specimen. For the analysed specimens failure originated mainly from the weld root, where a severe notch is present, even if some failure from the weld toe was observed in case of bending loading. However, the crack propagation and fracture surface under bending and under torsion were significantly different. For this reason, in order to investigate any possible influence of the loading order on the fatigue endurance, the effect of different loading blocks was analysed in this work. This subject has not been widely investigated in the technical literature about welded joints. In a first series of tests, specimens were loaded in bending for a given fraction of the estimated endurance and then were loaded in torsion till failure. A similar series of tests was then conducted by varying the loading order: specimens were loaded in torsion for a given fraction of the estimated endurance, followed by a block of bending loading till failure. The whole test campaign was repeated for two different fractions of the estimated life, i. e. 0. 3 and 0. 45, respectively. The failure was intended {{as the presence of}} a through the thickness crack, whose presence was monitored by a drop in the internal pressure of the pipe. Results are discussed in terms of the Miner’s rule based on nominal stresses and to the cumulative damage suggested by Eurocode and IIW...|$|R
