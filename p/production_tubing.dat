25|$|On wells {{with gas}} lift capability, many {{operators}} consider it prudent {{to install a}} valve, which will isolate the Aannulus {{for the same reasons}} a DHSV may be needed to isolate the <b>production</b> <b>tubing</b> in order to prevent the inventory of natural gas downhole from becoming a hazard as it became on Piper Alpha.|$|E
25|$|Completion, in {{petroleum}} production, is {{the process}} of making a well ready for production (or injection).

25|$|This valve allows fluids {{to pass up}} or be pumped {{down the}} <b>production</b> <b>tubing.</b> When closed the DHSV forms a barrier in the {{direction}} of hydrocarbon flow, but fluids can still be pumped down for well kill operations. It is placed as far below the surface as is deemed safe from any possible surface disturbance including cratering caused by the wipeout of the platform. Where hydrates are likely to form (most production is at risk of this), the depth of the SCSSV (surface-controlled, sub-surface safety valve) below the seabed may be as much as 1km: this will allow for the geothermal temperature to be high enough to prevent hydrates from blocking the valve.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Production</b> <b>tubing</b> is {{the main}} conduit for {{transporting}} hydrocarbons from the reservoir to surface (or injection material the other way). [...] It runs from the tubing hanger {{at the top of}} the wellhead down to a point generally just above the top of the production zone.|$|E
2500|$|The upper {{completion}} {{refers to}} all components {{from the bottom}} of the <b>production</b> <b>tubing</b> upwards.

2500|$|This {{component}} is {{intended as a}} last-resort method of protecting the surface from the uncontrolled release of hydrocarbons. It is a cylindrical valve with either a ball or flapper closing mechanism. [...] It is installed in the <b>production</b> <b>tubing</b> and is held {{in the open position}} by a high-pressure hydraulic line from surface contained in a 6.35mm (1/4") control line that is attached to the DHSV's hydraulic chamber and terminated at surface to an hydraulic actuator. The high pressure is needed to overcome the production pressure in the tubing upstream of the choke on the tree. The valve will operate if the umbilical HPline is cut or the wellhead/tree is destroyed.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Production</b> <b>tubing</b> is {{run into}} the drilled well after the casing is run and {{cemented}} in place. <b>Production</b> <b>tubing</b> protects wellbore casing from wear, tear, corrosion, and deposition of by-products, such as sand / silt, paraffins, and asphaltenes. Along with other components that constitute the production string, it provides a continuous bore from the production zone to the wellhead through which oil and gas can be produced. It is usually between five and ten centimeters in diameter and is held inside the casing {{through the use of}} expandable packing devices. Purpose and design of <b>production</b> <b>tubing</b> is to enable quick, efficient, and safe installation, removal and re-installation.|$|E

Vallourec is specialized in products used in extreme conditions such as deep wells, corrosive environments, deviated wells, and high pressure and high temperature conditions as well.|$|R
30|$|Among {{parameters}} affecting asphaltene precipitation, <b>production</b> rate, <b>tubing</b> and choke sizes {{have the}} most impact on precipitation process. As production rate increases from 4000 to 7000 STB/day, the length of tubing covered by asphaltene deposition enhances about 40 %; however, a decrease in the production rate to reduce this interval is not desirable. Tubing size has an inverse effect on precipitation length. As a matter of fact, in this case, as the tubing diameter increases from 3 to 7 inches, the precipitation interval reduces about 2500 ft. In addition, a greater increase in the tubing size results in more depth of precipitation initiation. The choke size results in the same effect on the depth of precipitation initiation as the production rate does because generally, an increase in choke size is directly proportional to the production rate.|$|R

40|$|During {{petroleum}} production, asphaltene particles can precipitate {{from the}} crude oil due to pressure, temperature, and composition changes along the fluid {{path from the}} reservoir to the surface. Once precipitated, those particles can deposit in the inner surface of <b>production</b> <b>tubings,</b> restricting the available flow area and reducing flow rates. To enable {{a better understanding of}} that complex mass transfer problem, a new methodology was proposed in this paper. The methodology involved a comprehensive review of fundamental concepts of the mass transfer and particle deposition theories, placing the asphaltene deposition within a more general context of particle deposition during turbulent flow. Six published particle deposition models (Lin et al., 1953. Ind. Eng. Chem. 45 (3), 636 - 640.; Friedlander and Johnstone, 1957. Ind. Eng. Chem. 49 (7), 1151 - 1956.; Beal, 1970. Nucl. Sci.

Paper SPE 29488 presented at the SPE Production Operations Symposium, Oldahoma City, Oklahoma, 2 - 4 April.) were studied and validated with four published aerosol experimental data sets (Friedlander, 1954. Deposition of Aerosol Particles from Turbulent Gases. Ph. D. Dissertation, University of Illinois, Urbana, Illinois (July 1954); Wells and Chamberlain, 1967. Br. J. Appl.

University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota (June 1975)). Based on the results of the study, Bears (1970. Nucl. Sci. Eng. 40, 1 - 11) model was selected as the most suitable to predict particle deposition and was considered adequate also to predict asphaltene deposition (limiting its application to similar ranges of Reynolds numbers, Schmidt numbers and dimensionless relaxation times in relation to those covered in the validation study). Finally, that model was applied in a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the most important parameters and transport mechanisms governing asphaltene deposition in wellbores. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|CO 2 {{corrosion}} is {{an important}} degradation problem with major implications {{for oil and gas}} industries. Particularly, pipes in contact with production fluids are very susceptible to this kind of damage. CO 2 corrosion problems are mainly controlled by two ways: using inhibitor formulation treatments or using chromium alloys to reinforce tubing materials performance. Related with this, stainless steels like 13 % Cr and 22 % Cr present a good corrosion resistance; nevertheless, their cost is very high compared with carbon steel tubulars. Keeping in mind the necessity of oil industry to reduce <b>production</b> costs, <b>tubing</b> manufacturers developed less chromium alloys to cover less severe CO 2 partial pressure applications. The present work was carried out to study the CO 2 corrosion resistance of two different low alloy steels containing 3 % Cr. It is the first stage on low Cr materials research by PDVSA. The steels tested were identified as 3 CrA and 3 CrB alloys. Corrosion tests were performed during 120 h in static autoclaves at different CO 2 partial pressures (7, 30 and 50 psi) and temperatures (50, 60 and 100 °C), according to specific field conditions. Weight loss corrosion tests were used in order to determine corrosion rates for both steels. Corrosion products characterisation was performed using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), chemical microanalysis by Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) and X-Ra...|$|R
5000|$|A {{gas-lift}} valve is {{a device}} installed on (or in) a gas-lift mandrel, {{which in turn}} is put on the <b>production</b> <b>tubing</b> of a gas-lift well. Tubing and casing pressures cause the valve to open and close, thus allowing gas to be injected into the fluid in the tubing to cause the fluid to rise to the surface.

2500|$|Birmingham's {{ingenuity}} and expertise in metal working aids the early <b>production</b> of lightweight <b>tubing</b> {{used in the}} construction of successful airplanes. Engineering firms pioneer advances in aircraft engines also such as Austin and Wolseley Motors Limited, who later build hundreds of early aircraft for the British Air force, such as the S.E.5 biplane fighter. Wolseley help to set Vickers on their path to motor and engine development for aircraft at Adderly Park, with a new engine ready for production by 1909. The Wolseley Viper engine is applied to many aircraft around this time and is developed out of the Hispano-Suiza 8. Several other small engineering firms design and build early aircraft engines such as Maxfield & Co, who test an early monoplane in 1909 at Castle Bromwich, the Butterfield Brothers also make an experimental aircraft engine in 1911. Birmingham engineering works later diversify with all manner of industries relating to the development and manufacture of aircraft components including assembly of whole planes during war years such as Spitfires, Hawker Hurricanes, Fairey Battle light bombers, Mercury and Pegasus aero engines, Short Stirling four-engined heavy bombers and Avro Lancasters (towards the end of World War II).|$|R
40|$|Inorganic scale may {{precipitate}} in oilfield systems, down {{hole in the}} reservoir, in the <b>production</b> flow <b>tubing,</b> and in surface facilities, as {{a consequence}} of thermodynamic changes that affect the flowing brines. These changes may be induced by temperature or pressure changes, or by mixing of incompatible brines. While much work has been performed to study the effect of thermodynamic changes such as pressure decrease or temperature increase on scale precipitation, it is only recently that a body of work has been developed on the impact that the dynamics of brine mixing in the reservoir has on scale precipitation in situ. Much of this work has been conducted using finite difference simulators, which are handicapped with regard to these calculations in that numerical dispersion effects can be orders of magnitude greater than physical dispersion. The introduction of chemical reaction calculations into streamline simulation models presents a very significant opportunity for improving the accuracy of such calculations. While numerical dispersion effects for immiscible calculations (eg water displacing oil) can be countered by pseudoisation of the relative permeability functions, in finite difference models it is difficult to control numerical dispersion for miscible displacements e. g. seawater (with a Sulphate concentration) displacing formation water (with a Barium concentration), which may lead to scaling in the reservoir (Barium Sulphate precipitation). Streamline simulation reduces the numerical errors for both miscible and immiscible displacement, thus making the scaling calculations much more accurate. The objective of this PhD project was to study the application of a streamline simulator, which has the appropriate chemistry modeling capabilities, to realistic reservoir scenarios. The project consisted of two stages: 1) Study of synthetic systems to identify the impact of brine mixing in simple scenarios (eg single layer and multi-layer quarter five spot patterns) 2) Application of the technique to full field reservoir systems to improve the capability of making scale management decision during the project Front End Engineering and Design (FEED) phase. The calculations performed demonstrate where, and under what conditions, scale precipitation takes place in situ in the reservoir, and what the resulting impact on the chemical composition of the produced brine will be. This information is key in the planning of the management of oilfield scale...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to increase oil production and reserves in the Uinta Basin by demonstrating improved completion techniques. Low productivity of Uinta Basin wells is caused by gross production intervals of several thousand feet that contain perforated thief zones, water-bearing zones, and unperforated oil-bearing intervals. Geologic and engineering characterization and computer simulation of the Green River and Wasatch formations in the Bluebell field will determine reservoir heterogeneities related to fractures and depositional trends. This {{will be followed by}} drilling and recompletion of several wells to demonstrate improved completion techniques based on the reservoir characterization. Transfer of the project results will be an ongoing component of the project. The recompletion of the Michelle Ute 7 - 1 well commenced and {{is the first step in}} the three-well demonstration. As part of the recompletion, the gross productive interval was logged, additional beds were perforated, and the entire interval was stimulated with a three-stage acid treatment. The operator attempted to stimulate the well at high pressure (about 10, 000 pounds per square inch (psi) [68, 950 kPa]) at three separate packer locations. But at each location the pressure would not hold. As a result, all three stages were pumped at a lower pressure (6500 psi maximum [44, 820 kPa]) from one packer location. As of December 31, 1996, the operator was tripping in the hole with the <b>production</b> packer and <b>tubing</b> to begin swab testing the well...|$|R

40|$|The {{useful life}} of an {{offshore}} well {{is determined by the}} reserves which it contacts, the pressure support within the reservoir and the continued integrity of the wellbore. When a well has reached the end of its lifetime, plugging operations have to be conducted before permanent abandonment. Conventional Plug and Abandonment (P&A) operations will often require removing a section of the casing in order to create cross sectional barriers for well abandonment. Recently developed and field tested technology has the potential of efficiently setting cross sectional reservoir barriers without casing removal. Access to the annuli can be achieved through perforation and then the perforated interval can be washed prior to setting a P&A barrier. By deploying a wireline rig-up it can be possible to set a reservoir barrier prior to removal of the previously installed <b>production</b> or injection <b>tubing.</b> Wireline work can also provide information about the well integrity which can determine the potential for setting further reservoir barriers with minimum removal of tubulars. Further development of technology necessary to safely abandon wells with minimum removal of tubulars can provide cost efficient and robust plugging methods for abandoning offshore oil or gas fields without the need of deploying a drilling rig. This thesis will introduce methods of setting P&A barriers with minimal removal of tubulars as the main focus. Descriptions of various plugging operations will be given. Considerations regarding the critical factors encountered during plugging operations will be discussed, more specifically the current condition of wellbore integrity and the barrier envelope necessary to prevent uncontrolled release of hydrocarbons during or after plugging operations...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} a partnership between Cooperative Extension at the University of Nebraska and a private industry to demonstrate the role of pollution prevention in helping to rejuvenate business and industry and to illustrate how resources available at state universities could be brought to bear in demonstrating the value of pollution prevention in the private sector. The program was a complete success from the stand-points of the university; which provided valuable field training for research personnel and assistants, and the industry which was able to achieve considerable savings in waste treatment costs and improved product quality. The industrial pollution prevention program took place at an aging manufacturing facility that engaged in metal galvanizing, electroplating, painting and assodiated activities. The facility produces fabricated metal products for farm, commercial and industrial use including structural steel members and plates, farm gates, fencing, and livestock watering tanks, in addition {{to a wide variety of}} structural bolts, fasteners, and so on. During manufacturing, the facility performs many operations including electroplating, hot-dip galvanizing, and painting among other activities that result in the production of a variety of hazardous pollutants (gaseous, solid, and liquid) that must be disposed of in some fashion. In developing the demonstration project, emphasis was placed on areas where the impact on reducing the total pollutant load produced by this facility would be the greatest. These areas were the electroplating, hot-dip galvanizing, painting, and <b>tubing</b> <b>production</b> lines. These areas produce the bulk of the wastes with the greatest toxicity and hazard, and consequently, any improvements in these areas would result in the greatest impacts.

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 Beginning {{with the}} {{discovery}} of x-rays by Wilhelm Konrad Roentgen in 1895, man has had the capacity to greatly increase radiation levels of his environment, especially with the advent of nuclear weapons in recent years. Radioisotopes are finding progressively wider use in medicine, research, power production, etc., with increased hazards to the workers and communities involved. The biological effects that follow exposure to ionizing radiation are a realistic problem. It would, therefore, be desirable to understand more about the mode of radiation action so that possible hazards associated with ionizing radiation can be fully controlled. There is at present a need to investigate further the effects of ionizing radiation on metabolic processes and factors involved in the metabolic mechanism of the cell in intact animals. The purpose in the preparation and work involved in this thesis was to investigate one aspect of metabolism in animals after x-irradiation, namely, carbohydrate metabolism. Radiorespirometric experiments were designed to study pathways of glucose catabolism in mature rats and changes in relative participation of glucose pathways after x-irradiation at the LD 50 dose. To successfully carry out these experiments, a respiratory CO₂ and ¹⁴CO₂ analyzer was developed featuring accurate and continuous analysis of respiratory CO₂ for four concurrent experiments. ¹⁴CO₂ from the metabolizing animal was measured by means of a vibrating reed electrometer and total CO₂ excretion by means of infra-red absorption spectrometry. Readout of data was accomplished in digital form in a manner which allowed a minute by minute tally of ¹⁴CO₂ yield from the administered ¹⁴C labeled substrate in each of the concurrent experiments. The precision of such measurement is estimated to be less than one percent. The radiorespirometric method involves the use of differences in rates and yields of ¹⁴CO₂ formation from ¹⁴C specifically labeled carbon atoms of a substrate. Such information reflects directly the nature of the catabolic sequence traversed by the substrate. An aqueous solution of ¹⁴C specifically labeled glucose containing 1. 5 g of glucose was administered to the rat via stomach <b>tubing.</b> <b>Production</b> of respiratory ¹⁴CO₂ was followed {{until the end of the}} complete time course of utilization of the labeled substrate.
