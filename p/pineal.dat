5|$|The tuatara has a third {{eye on the}} top of {{its head}} called the parietal eye. It has its own lens, a parietal plug which resembles a cornea, retina with {{rod-like}} structures, and degenerated nerve connection to the brain. The parietal eye is only visible in hatchlings, which have a translucent patch at the top centre of the skull. After four to six months, it becomes covered with opaque scales and pigment. Its purpose is unknown, but it may be useful in absorbing ultraviolet rays to produce vitamin D, as well as to determine light/dark cycles, and help with thermoregulation. Of all extant tetrapods, the parietal eye is most pronounced in the tuatara. It is part of the <b>pineal</b> complex, another part of which is the <b>pineal</b> gland, which in tuatara secretes melatonin at night. Some salamanders have been shown to use their <b>pineal</b> bodies to perceive polarised light, and thus determine the position of the sun, even under cloud cover, aiding navigation.|$|E
5|$|Connecting the {{forebrain}} to the midbrain is the diencephalon (in the diagram, {{this structure}} {{is below the}} optic lobes and consequently not visible). The diencephalon performs functions associated with hormones and homeostasis. The <b>pineal</b> body lies just above the diencephalon. This structure detects light, maintains circadian rhythms, and controls color changes.|$|E
5|$|The {{cerebral}} {{region of}} the brain is separated {{from the rest of}} the brain by a distinct compression caused in the endocranial cavity. The rearmost part of the cerebral {{region of the}} braincase has a top with a small expansion. This is different from Jainosaurus. However, relatively much larger expansions are known in the diplodocoid sauropods Dicraeosaurus and Diplodocus. In MCCM-HUE-8741, the small opening in the skull roof middle is responsible for a swelling on the endocast that is suggestive of a <b>pineal</b> system. It is in the exact position where the <b>pineal</b> gland is expected to have been, between the forebrain and the midbrain.|$|E
5|$|Microdontia of {{a single}} tooth {{is more likely to}} occur in a maxillary lateral incisor. The second most likely tooth to have microdontia are third molars. Macrodontia of all the teeth is known to occur in {{pituitary}} gigantism and <b>pineal</b> hyperplasia. It may also occur {{on one side of the}} face in cases of hemifacial hyperplasia.|$|E
5|$|René Descartes {{proposed}} {{the theory of}} dualism to tackle {{the issue of the}} brain's relation to the mind. He suggested that the <b>pineal</b> gland was where the mind interacted with the body after recording the brain mechanisms responsible for circulating cerebrospinal fluid. This dualism likely provided impetus for later anatomists to further explore the relationship between the anatomical and functional aspects of brain anatomy.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the initial}} description, the eye socket of Euchambersia is rather small. The {{branches}} of the postorbital and jugal that usually surround the back {{and bottom of the}} eye socket in therocephalians appear to be either very reduced or absent entirely. Meanwhile, the top of the eye socket is formed by the prefrontal, and the frontal is also small. The skull does not bear a <b>pineal</b> foramen. Like Whaitsia, the pterygoid and palatine of the palate are not separated from the transpalatine, further {{to the side of the}} jaw, by any sort of opening.|$|E
5|$|In poor conditions, {{the weight}} of the adrenal gland may {{increase}} up to 200%, and rice rats are unable to conserve water well when dehydrated, and in water contaminated with oil, they swim less and their mortality increases. The median amount of radiation needed to kill a marsh rice rat is 5.25Gy and the lethal dose of potassium cyanide is 7.20mg/kg; both values are relatively low for cricetid rodents. In one study, wild rice rats in radioactively contaminated areas did not show signs of disease. Exposure to more daylight and higher food availability cause increased development of the gonads in both adult and juvenile rice rats. When the <b>pineal</b> gland is removed or melatonin is administered in male rice rats, the testes are reduced and tend to regress into the body.|$|E
5|$|The larger arteries {{throughout}} the brain supply blood to smaller capillaries. These smallest {{of blood vessels}} in the brain, are lined with cells joined by tight junctions and so fluids do not seep in or leak out to the same degree as they do in other capillaries, thereby creating the blood-brain barrier. Pericytes {{play a major role in}} the formation of the tight junctions. The barrier is less permeable to larger molecules, but is still permeable to water, carbon dioxide, oxygen, and most fat-soluble substances (including anaesthetics and alcohol). The blood-brain barrier is not present in areas of the brain that may need to respond to changes in body fluids, such as the <b>pineal</b> gland, area postrema, and some areas of the hypothalamus. There is a similar blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier, which serves the same purpose as the blood–brain barrier, but facilitates the transport of different substances into the brain due to the distinct structural characteristics between the two barrier systems.|$|E
5|$|The {{cerebrum}} {{is connected}} by the brainstem to the spinal cord. The brainstem {{consists of the}} midbrain, the pons, and the medulla oblongata. The cerebellum {{is connected to the}} brainstem by pairs of tracts. Within the cerebrum is the ventricular system, consisting of four interconnected ventricles in which cerebrospinal fluid is produced and circulated. Underneath the cerebral cortex are several important structures, including the thalamus, the epithalamus, the <b>pineal</b> gland, the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland, and the subthalamus; the limbic structures, including the amygdala and the hippocampus; the claustrum, the various nuclei of the basal ganglia; the basal forebrain structures, and the three circumventricular organs. The cells of the brain include neurons and supportive glial cells. There are more than 86 billion neurons in the brain, and a more or less equal number of other cells. Brain activity is made possible by the interconnections of neurons and their release of neurotransmitters in response to nerve impulses. Neurons form elaborate neural networks of neural pathways and circuits. The whole circuitry is driven by the process of neurotransmission.|$|E
25|$|Calcium, phosphorus, and {{fluoride}} {{deposits in}} the <b>pineal</b> gland have been correlated with aging, showing that, as the brain ages, more deposits collect. By old age, the <b>pineal</b> gland contains {{about the same}} amount of fluoride as teeth. <b>Pineal</b> fluoride and <b>pineal</b> calcium are correlated.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pineal</b> cytostructure {{seems to}} have {{evolutionary}} similarities to the retinal cells of the lateral eyes. Modern birds and reptiles express the phototransducing pigment melanopsin in the <b>pineal</b> gland. Avian <b>pineal</b> glands are thought to act like the suprachiasmatic nucleus in mammals. The structure of the <b>pineal</b> eye in modern lizards and tuatara {{is analogous to the}} cornea, lens, and retina of the lateral eyes of vertebrates.|$|E
25|$|The <b>pineal</b> {{organs of}} mammals fall {{into one of}} three {{categories}} based on shape. Rodents have more structurally-complex <b>pineal</b> glands than other mammals.|$|E
25|$|In 1958, {{dermatology}} professor Aaron B. Lerner {{and colleagues}} at Yale University, {{in the hope that}} a substance from the <b>pineal</b> might be useful in treating skin diseases, isolated the hormone from bovine <b>pineal</b> gland extracts and named it melatonin. In the mid-70s Lynch et al. demonstrated that the production of melatonin exhibits a circadian rhythm in human <b>pineal</b> glands.|$|E
25|$|The <b>pineal</b> gland is {{the only}} midline brain {{structure}} that is unpaired (azygous). It {{takes its name from}} its pine-cone shape. The gland is reddish-gray and {{about the size of a}} grain of rice (5–8mm) in humans. The <b>pineal</b> gland, also called the <b>pineal</b> body, is part of the epithalamus, and lies between the laterally positioned thalamic bodies and behind the habenular commissure. It is located in the quadrigeminal cistern near to the corpora quadrigemina. It is also located behind the third ventricle and is bathed in cerebrospinal fluid supplied through a small <b>pineal</b> recess of the third ventricle which projects into the stalk of the gland.|$|E
25|$|The {{results of}} various {{scientific}} research in evolutionary biology, comparative neuroanatomy and neurophysiology, have explained the phylogeny of the <b>pineal</b> gland in different vertebrate species. From {{the point of}} view of biological evolution, the <b>pineal</b> gland represents a kind of atrophied photoreceptor. In the epithalamus of some species of amphibians and reptiles, it is linked to a light-sensing organ, known as the parietal eye, which is also called the <b>pineal</b> eye or third eye.|$|E
25|$|The <b>pineal</b> body {{is labeled}} in these images.|$|E
25|$|The fossilized skulls of many extinct {{vertebrates}} have a <b>pineal</b> foramen (opening), {{which in}} some cases is larger than that of any living vertebrate. Although fossils seldom preserve deep-brain soft anatomy, the brain of the Russian fossil bird Cerebavis cenomanica from Melovatka, about 90million years old, shows a relatively large parietal eye and <b>pineal</b> gland.|$|E
25|$|The human <b>pineal</b> gland {{grows in}} size until about 1–2 years of age, {{remaining}} stable thereafter, although its weight increases gradually from puberty onwards. The abundant melatonin levels in children {{are believed to}} inhibit sexual development, and <b>pineal</b> tumors have been linked with precocious puberty. When puberty arrives, melatonin production is reduced.|$|E
25|$|In Theosophy it {{is related}} to the <b>pineal</b> gland. According to this belief, humans had in far ancient times an actual third eye {{in the back of the}} head with a {{physical}} and spiritual function. Over time, as humans evolved, this eye atrophied and sunk into what today is known as the <b>pineal</b> gland. Dr. Rick Strassman has hypothesized that the <b>pineal</b> gland, which maintains light sensitivity, is responsible for the production and release of DMT (dimethyltryptamine), an entheogen which he believes possibly could be excreted in large quantities at the moments of birth and death.|$|E
25|$|In most vertebrates, {{exposure}} to light sets off {{a chain reaction}} of enzymatic events within the <b>pineal</b> gland that regulates circadian rhythms. In humans and other mammals, the light signals necessary to set circadian rhythms are sent from the eye through the retinohypothalamic system to the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) and the <b>pineal</b> gland.|$|E
25|$|A <b>pineal</b> tumour can {{compress}} {{the superior}} colliculi and pretectal {{area of the}} dorsal midbrain, producing Parinaud's syndrome. <b>Pineal</b> tumours also can cause compression of the cerebral aqueduct, resulting in a noncommunicating hydrocephalus. Other manifestations are the consequence of their pressure effects and consist of visual disturbances, headache, mental deterioration, and sometimes dementia-like behaviour.|$|E
25|$|Rick Strassman, {{an author}} and Clinical Associate Professor of Psychiatry at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine, has theorised that the human <b>pineal</b> gland is capable of {{producing}} the hallucinogen N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) under certain circumstances. In 2013 he and other researchers first reported DMT in the <b>pineal</b> gland microdialysate of rodents.|$|E

25|$|During {{embryonic}} development, the parietal {{eye and the}} <b>pineal</b> {{organ of}} modern lizards and tuataras form together from a pocket formed in the brain ectoderm. The loss of parietal eyes in many living tetrapods is supported by developmental formation of a paired structure that subsequently fuses into a single <b>pineal</b> gland in developing embryos of turtles, snakes, birds, and mammals.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pineal</b> gland {{calcification}} {{may also}} contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and may reflect an absence of crystallization inhibitors.|$|E
25|$|Like other Cyclura iguanas, Ricord's iguanas {{have evolved}} a white photosensory organ {{on the top}} of their heads called the parietal eye, which are also called third eye, <b>pineal</b> eye or <b>pineal</b> gland. This “eye” does not work the same way as a normal eye does as it has only a {{rudimentary}} retina and lens and thus, cannot form images. It is however sensitive to changes in light and dark and can detect movement.|$|E
25|$|A 2013 {{study found}} DMT in microdialysate {{obtained}} from a rat's <b>pineal</b> gland, providing evidence of endogenous DMT in the mammalian brain.|$|E
25|$|Most living {{vertebrates}} have <b>pineal</b> glands. It's {{likely that}} the common ancestor of all vertebrates {{had a pair of}} photosensory organs on the top of its head, similar to the arrangement in modern lampreys. Some extinct Devonian fishes have two parietal foramina in their skulls, suggesting an ancestral bilaterality of parietal eyes. The parietal eye and the <b>pineal</b> gland of living tetrapods are probably the descendants of the left and right parts of this organ, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Ruben & Jones (2000) {{note that}} the Harderian glands, which secrete lipids for coating the fur, {{were present in the}} {{earliest}} mammals like Morganucodon, but were absent in near-mammalian therapsids like Thrinaxodon. The Msx2 gene associated with hair follicle maintenance is also linked to the closure of the parietal eye in mammals, indicating that fur and lack of <b>pineal</b> eye is linked. The <b>pineal</b> eye is present in Thrinaxodon, but absent in more advanced cynognaths (the Probainognathia).|$|E
25|$|Calcification of the <b>pineal</b> gland {{has also}} {{been found to be}} closely {{associated}} to certain types of migraines as well as cluster headaches.|$|E
25|$|Some {{studies show}} that the degree of <b>pineal</b> gland {{calcification}} is significantly higher in patients with Alzheimer's disease vs. other types of dementia.|$|E
25|$|The {{compound}} pinoline is {{also claimed}} to be produced in the <b>pineal</b> gland; {{it is one of}} the beta-carbolines. This claim is subject to some controversy.|$|E
25|$|The <b>pineal</b> body {{consists}} in humans of a lobular parenchyma of pinealocytes surrounded by connective tissue spaces. The gland's surface {{is covered by}} a pial capsule.|$|E
25|$|In the {{zebrafish}} the <b>pineal</b> gland {{does not}} straddle the midline but shows a left-sided bias. In humans, functional cerebral dominance {{is accompanied by}} subtle anatomical asymmetry.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century Madame Blavatsky (who founded theosophy) {{identified}} the <b>pineal</b> gland with the Hindu {{concept of the}} third eye, or the Ajna chakra. This association is still popular today.|$|E
25|$|Studies on rodents {{suggest that}} the <b>pineal</b> gland may {{influence}} the actions of recreational drugs, such as cocaine, and antidepressants, such as fluoxetine (Prozac), and that its hormone melatonin can protect against neurodegeneration.|$|E
