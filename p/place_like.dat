5|$|President Nixon {{was more}} than willing to seize the {{advantage}} offered by the ousting of Sihanouk and the opportunity to strike the border sanctuaries as a means of buying time for both the U.S. and South Vietnam. On 29 April, the first bombings of Operation Patio took <b>place.</b> <b>Like</b> Menu, these tactical airstrikes were held in close secrecy. Although they were initially an anti-infiltration measure, they quickly expanded as targets deeper in Cambodia became the norm. The program was quickly superseded by Operation Freedom Deal, the overt support of FANK troops by B-52 and tactical airstrikes by American and South Vietnamese aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Then the accompanist {{returns to}} Life's A Funny Proposition until {{the father is}} sitting down in the house. What's the Use of Dreaming leads to Gee, But It's Great to Meet a Friend {{with the arrival of}} a friend. A waltz accompanies the gallery scene until the picture is shown, leading to Some Day When Dreams Come True as the artist becomes famous. The {{introduction}} with the society woman is accompanied by How Do You Do Miss Josephine and then by So Long Mary as she exits. No <b>Place</b> <b>Like</b> Home begins the next scene until the wife recognizes the emotional distancing of her husband when All I Ask is Love is played. The studio scene begins with I Love My Wife, But Oh You Kid and leads to Be Sweet to Me Kid or Next to your Mother... with Nobody's Little Girl during the crying scene.|$|E
5|$|In {{the story}} group, monsters {{were the first}} thing designed. The monsters' names, skills, and personalities were decided first, after which they were drawn by artist Akira Toriyama. Yuji Horii allowed Toriyama to paint full {{drawings}} rather than directly create the pixel art that would be shown in the game. The artwork was then converted into computer graphics; as Toriyama was unfamiliar with computer graphics technology, other staff took charge of this. Many new monsters needed to be designed to make the game feel real, and the process was laborious for Toriyama. But he has also said that, compared to the manga comics he was used to, he enjoyed painting more, so on balance the experience was positive. Yuji Horii stated that for his process, like other manga and film creators, he quickly outlines the story's plot in his mind. With regard to map design, a blank map was used to create the physical shape of the <b>place,</b> <b>like</b> a castle, cave, or tower, and then the key elements and story were created together afterwards. The scenarios were mainly written by his friend Hiroshi Miyaoka. Compared with write lines in writing paper and design map in graph paper, staff wrote both two in 5mm graph papers of A4, as they felt that's easy for organization; their manuscript thickness is 15cm.|$|E

25|$|Henzell also shot some footage {{for what}} was planned as his next film, No <b>Place</b> <b>Like</b> Home, in Harder's aftermath, but he went broke before he could finish the film. Fed up by this, {{and the lack of}} finance for further production, he {{went on to become a}} writer, {{publishing}} his first novel, Power Game, in 1982. Both were meant to complete a planned trilogy of films centring on Ivanhoe Martin. The footage for No <b>Place</b> <b>Like</b> Home was lost. Years later, he came across editing tapes in a lab in New York. Just to have a sense of completion, he worked on the project. When he showed it to a few friends, their response was enthusiastic. He eventually was able to retrieve the original footage. No <b>Place</b> <b>Like</b> Home was screened for the public at the 31st annual Toronto International Film Festival in September 2006 at the Cumberland Theatre; it was sold out. Film leads Carl Bradshaw (The Harder They Come, Smile Orange, Countryman) and Susan O'Meara attended and answered audience questions with Henzell after the screening. The film was scheduled to be screened at the Flashpoint Film Festival at the beginning of December 2006 in Negril.|$|E

She was also involved in prostitution.|$|E
25|$|In 1464, Gaston IV of Foix-Béarn, {{after he}} married the Infanta Eleanor of Aragon, {{transferred}} his Court of Orthez to Pau. Pau thus became the fourth historic capital of Béarn, after Lescar, Morlaàs and Orthez. The city had a municipal charter; fairs took <b>place,</b> <b>like</b> the Béarn states.

25|$|Since 1992, the French Centre National d'Études Spatiales (CNES) has {{operated}} a satellite and rocket tracking station {{which is located}} four kilometers east of Port-aux-Français. CNES needed a tracking station in the Southern Hemisphere, and the French government required that it be located on French territory, {{rather than in a}} populated, but foreign, <b>place</b> <b>like</b> Australia or New Zealand.|$|E

25|$|I {{had to get}} my {{grasshoppers}} from Waco, Texas. They had {{the only}} species large enough to carry focus. I could only import males because they didn't want the things to start breeding. They even had someone from the agricultural department or some <b>place</b> <b>like</b> that come out to take a head count, or wing count. The grasshoppers turned cannibalistic.|$|E

25|$|Pollination is {{the process}} by which pollen is {{transferred}} to the female reproductive organs of a plant, thereby enabling fertilization to take <b>place.</b> <b>Like</b> all living organisms, seed plants have a single major purpose: to pass their genetic information on to the next generation. The reproductive unit is the seed, and pollination is an essential step in the production of seeds in all spermatophytes (seed plants).|$|E
25|$|There {{are ongoing}} and coming {{projects}} for high-speed upgrades on the closest 50–100km from Oslo {{on each of}} these lines (except direction Stockholm). They have good potential for regional trains. Upgrade and new construction to high-speed standard have to some extent already taken <b>place</b> <b>like</b> for Gardermobanen. The time plan is to have 200km/h or more from Oslo to Porsgrunn (partially slower), to Hamar and to Råde east of Moss around 2020-2025, and to Halden and Hønefoss later, maybe 2030.|$|E
25|$|The Chugach {{people live}} on the southern-most coasts of Alaska. Birket-Smith {{conducted}} fieldwork among them in the 1950s, when traditionally ceremonial ways had already ceased practice. Chugach apprentice angakkuit were not forced to become spiritual healers by the spirits. They instead deliberately visited lonely places and walked for many days until they received a visitation of a spirit. The apprentice then passed out, and the spirit took {{him or her to}} another <b>place</b> (<b>like</b> the mountains or the depths of the sea). Whilst there, the spirit instructed the apprentice in their calling, such as teaching them their personal song.|$|E

25|$|She {{signed up}} for a brief six-week course in filmmaking at New York University (NYU), where she came into contact with budding young filmmaker Martin Scorsese, who was {{struggling}} to complete his film What's a Nice Girl Like You Doing in a <b>Place</b> <b>Like</b> This? A negative cutter had butchered his film, not leaving enough negative frames to allow for hot splicing. One of her film professors asked Schoonmaker to help Scorsese; a close working relationship with him unfolded over the next thirty-five years. Schoonmaker edited Scorsese's first feature film, Who's That Knocking at My Door (1967).|$|E
25|$|The closest 50–100km from Oslo on each {{of these}} lines have good {{potential}} for regional trains (except direction Stockholm). Upgrade and new construction to high-speed standard have to some extent already taken <b>place</b> <b>like</b> for Gardermobanen. More is being built and is planned, but with the present ambition it will take decades to have high-speed standard the closest 100km from Oslo on all these lines. The ambition is to some day have 200km/h or more to Halden, Skien, Hønefoss and Hamar. These projects have higher priority than the long-distance projects. They are also preconditions for the long-distance projects, since they will be used by long-distance trains.|$|E
25|$|The squad {{during these}} two {{championship}} victories included; Giovanni De Prà, Ottavio Barbieri, Luigi Burlando and Renzo De Vecchi. With Genoa's championship victory in 1923–24 came {{the introduction of}} the scudetto patch; which means following the season which a club wins an Italian league championship, they are allowed to wear a shield shaped patch on their shirt which features the colours of the Italian flag. For the rest of the 1920s, the club did not win the championship, with the highest they were able to finish being second <b>place,</b> <b>like</b> in the 1927–28 season when they finished runners-up to Torino, with striker Felice Levratto scoring 20 goals in 27 games.|$|E

25|$|Aluminium, {{like its}} {{congener}} boron, is less electronegative than carbon (Al, 1.61; C, 2.55); thus, aluminium-bound carbons in organoalanes possess partial negative charge and are nucleophilic as a result. Generally, however, organoalanes are not nucleophilic enough to transfer an organic group {{on their own}} (the exception being when carbonyl and enone acceptors are used, due to the high oxophilicity of aluminium). In most cases, nucleophilic activation of organoalanes is necessary for group transfer to take <b>place.</b> <b>Like</b> organoboranes, organoalanes possess an empty p orbital on the aluminium center that can receive electron density from an added nucleophile. The resulting negatively charged aluminate is much more nucleophilic than the neutral alane.|$|E
25|$|Scorsese {{attended}} New York University's Tisch School of the Arts (B.A., English, 1964; M.F.A., film, 1966) {{making the}} short films What's a Nice Girl Like You Doing in a <b>Place</b> <b>Like</b> This? (1963) and It's Not Just You, Murray! (1964). His most famous {{short of the}} period is the darkly comic The Big Shave (1967), which features Peter Bernuth. The film is an indictment of America's involvement in Vietnam, suggested by its alternative title Viet '67. Scorsese has mentioned on several occasions that he was greatly inspired in his early days at New York University by his Armenian American film professor Haig P. Manoogian.|$|E
25|$|The manorial records offer a good {{opportunity}} to study the geographical distribution of the plague. Its effect seems to have been about the same all over England, though a <b>place</b> <b>like</b> East Anglia, which had frequent contact with the Continent, was severely affected. On a local level, however, there were great variations. A study of the Bishop of Worcester's estates reveal that, while his manors of Hartlebury and Hambury had a mortality of only 19%, the manor of Aston lost as much as 80% of its population. The manor rolls are less useful for studying the demographic distribution of the mortality, since the rolls only record the heads of households, normally an adult male. Here the IPMs show us that the most vulnerable to the disease were infants and the elderly.|$|E
