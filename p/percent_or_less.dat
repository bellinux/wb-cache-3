We follow the practical formalism developed by Farhi et al. for the N= 1 case, i. e. one particle in a bag, who found that for a very large Yukawa coupling the classical bags are destabilized by quantum effects. We instead study the problem with a coupling constant {{in the range of}} the Standard Model for a large number of quanta N= 50 [...] 5000.

25|$|Tectonic {{earthquakes}} occur {{anywhere in}} the earth where there is sufficient stored elastic strain energy to drive fracture propagation along a fault plane. The sides of a fault move past each other smoothly and aseismically only {{if there are no}} irregularities or asperities along the fault surface that increase the frictional resistance. Most fault surfaces do have such asperities and this leads to a form of stick-slip behavior. Once the fault has locked, continued relative motion between the plates leads to increasing stress and therefore, stored strain energy in the volume around the fault surface. This continues until the stress has risen sufficiently to break through the asperity, suddenly allowing sliding over the locked portion of the fault, releasing the stored energy. This energy is released as a combination of radiated elastic strain seismic waves, frictional heating of the fault surface, and cracking of the rock, thus causing an earthquake. This process of gradual build-up of strain and stress punctuated by occasional sudden earthquake failure {{is referred to as the}} elastic-rebound theory. It is estimated that only 10 <b>percent</b> <b>or</b> <b>less</b> of an earthquake's total energy is radiated as seismic energy. Most of the earthquake's energy is used to power the earthquake fracture growth or is converted into heat generated by friction. Therefore, earthquakes lower the Earth's available elastic potential energy and raise its temperature, though these changes are negligible compared to the conductive and convective flow of heat out from the Earth's deep interior.|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{assess the}} {{effectiveness}} of health education provided by nurses {{about the effects of}} second hand smoke (SHS) exposure on children. Methods The subjects were non smoking mothers of sick children admitted to the pediatric wards of four major hospitals in Hong Kong during December 1997 to April 1998, with a smoking husband, living together in the same household with the child. Eligible subjects received a health education intervention provided by nurses which included giving standardized health advice and two purpose designed and culturally relevant booklets after randomization, and a telephone reminder one week later. Results A total of 334 mothers received the telephone reminder given by nurses. About 20 percent of the mothers had read the booklet and two thirds had asked the father to read it as well. Among the fathers who had got the booklets, only 55 percent had read through it. The majority of the fathers had either stopped smoking at home (20 <b>percent)</b> <b>or</b> smoked <b>less</b> (38 <b>percent)</b> after the intervention. A comparison of smoking behaviour at baseline and 1 week indicated that less fathers still smoked at home after the intervention (83 percent vs 80 percent). More fathers who had read the booklet did not smoke at home (27 percent vs 13 <b>percent)</b> <b>or</b> smoked <b>less</b> (48 <b>percent</b> vs 38 percent) as compared with those who had not done so. There was a marked increase in the mothers (85 90 percent) taking action to protect the child from exposure to SHS by requesting the father to stop smoking,to smoke less,or not to smoke at home. Conclusion Health education is a legitimate activity of nurses and is useful in changing the father’s smoking behaviour at home and the mother’s actions in preventing SHS exposure in sick children. There is a critical need to provide health education to mothers in order to promote awareness of SHS exposure and to prevent the health risks in the family so as to reduce illness and hospital admission in children...|$|R

The ultimate bearing capacity of such platforms is determined considering a layered soil model and assumes that collapse is governed by a punching shear mode of failure.

This paper investigates the punching shear coefficients using in computing the bearing capacity of layered soils. Finite Element Limit Analysis is used to obtain {{upper and lower bounds}} on the ultimate bearing capacity of layered soil system.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{an extension}} of a variationally optimized perturbation method, by combining it with renormalization group properties in a straightforward (perturbative) form. This leads to a very transparent and efficient procedure, with a clear improvement of the non-perturbative results with respect to previous similar variational approaches. This is illustrated here by deriving optimized results for the mass gap of the O(2 N) Gross-Neveu model, compared with the exactly know results for arbitrary N. At large N, the exact result is reproduced already at the very first order of the modified perturbation using this procedure. For arbitrary values of N, using the original perturbative information only known at two-loop order, we obtain a controllable <b>percent</b> accuracy <b>or</b> <b>less,</b> for any N value, {{as compared with the}} exactly known result for the mass gap from the thermodynamical Bethe Ansatz.

A series of tests performed on silty clay, in which stability was measured by triaxial compression tests, are described. It is shown that the relationship between density and stability of a soil depends on the criterion used to define stability; the greater the permissible strain before a sample is considered unstable, the greater is the possibility that an increase in density will cause an increase in stability. For the silty clay, when the stability is defined as the load required to cause 10 <b>percent</b> strain <b>or</b> <b>less,</b> an increase in density at a given water content caused an increase or decrease in stability de-pending upon the water content and the range of densities involved; at constant degrees of saturation, however, an increase in density always caused an increase in stability.
