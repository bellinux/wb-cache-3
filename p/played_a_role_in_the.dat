40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the relation between beliefs and goals in agent theory. Beliefs play three <b>roles</b> <b>in</b> reasoning about goals: they <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the generation of unconditional desires from conditional ones, they <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> adoption of desires as goals, and they <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the selection of plans to achieve goals. In this paper {{we consider the}} <b>role</b> of goals <b>in</b> reasoning about beliefs. Though we assume that goals do not <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the belief generation problem, we argue that they <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the belief selection problem. We show the rationality {{of the use of}} goals in belief selection, in the sense that there are cases in which agents that take their goals into account in selecting a belief set from a set of alternatives outperform agents that do not do so. We also formally distinguish between the rational <b>role</b> of goals <b>in</b> belief selection and irrational wishful thinking...|$|R

25|$|Quinolinic acid may be {{involved}} in schizophrenia; however, there has been no research done to examine the specific effects of quinolinic acid in schizophrenia. There are many studies that show that kynurenic acid (KYNA) <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, and there has been some research to suggest that 3-hydroxykynurenine (OHK) <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the disease as well.

50|$|BCATs also <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the {{physiology}} of plant species, {{but it has}} not been studied as extensively as mammalian BCATs.

In Solanum lycopersicum (tomatoes), BCATs <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> synthesizing the branched-chain amino acids that act as electron donors in the electron transport chain. Overall, plant BCATs have catabolic and anabolic regulatory functions.|$|R

5|$|Abdül Kadir was to {{have been}} the Ottoman Navy's first pre-dreadnought battleship. She {{followed}} a series of ironclad warships built in the 1860s and 1870s. In 1876, Sultan Murad V was deposed; the Ottoman Navy had <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> coup, which installed Abdul Hamid II on the throne. The new sultan was as a result suspicious of the navy, and attempted to reduce its power by withholding funding and ordering no new capital ships {{over the course of the}} following decade. By the late 1880s, however, the ships built by his predecessors were rapidly becoming obsolescent, especially compared to foreign designs like the British s.|$|E
