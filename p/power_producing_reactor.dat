50|$|The goal {{to produce}} {{meaningful}} fusion reactors {{in a reasonable}} time leads to pursuing the achievement of ignition conditions {{in the near term}} {{in order to understand the}} plasma physical regimes needed for a net <b>power</b> <b>producing</b> <b>reactor.</b> In addition, an objective other than ignition that can be envisioned for the relatively near term is that of high flux neutron sources for material testing involving compact, high density fusion machines. This has been one of the incentives that have led the Ignitor Project to adopt magnesium diboride (MgB2) superconducting cables in the machine design, a first in fusion research. Accordingly, the largest coils (about 5 m diameter) of the machine will be made entirely of MgB2 cables.|$|E
40|$|Evaluation of plasma {{parameters}} of driven and ignited Tokamaks {{for use in}} experimental power reactor (EPR) and commercial reactor applications has been performed. The {{purpose of this study}} is to evaluate the most pessimistic conditions under which a <b>power</b> <b>producing</b> <b>reactor</b> could be operated assuming the use of a high efficiency power (HEP) cycle. The adoption of the HEP cycle will enable a <b>power</b> <b>producing</b> <b>reactor</b> to operate with a plasma Q of 1. 5 or less as opposed to a required Q of approximately 8. 0 utilizing a conventional conversion cycle. Q is defined as the ratio of thermal fusion power produced to beam input power required. Pessimistic assumptions of large impurity concentrations and short confinement times are made in order to determine the regimes of operation the HEP cycle would render accessible. Characteristic values of plasma and reactor parameters are listed for each of three reactor models for both EPR's and commercial reactors and the favorable implications of the HEP cycle are delineated.

40|$|We have {{identified}} and developed new classes of quasi-axially symmetric configurations which have attractive properties {{from the standpoint}} of both near-term physics experiments and long-term <b>power</b> <b>producing</b> <b>reactors.</b> These new configurations were developed as a result of surveying the aspect ratio-rotational transform space to identify regions endowed with particularly interesting features. These include configurations with very small aspect ratios ({approx} 2. 5) having superior quasi-symmetry and energetic particle confinement characteristics, and configurations with strongly negative global magnetic shear from externally supplied rotational transforms so that the overall rotational transform, when combined with the transform from bootstrap currents at finite plasma pressures, will yield a small but positive shear, making the avoidance of low order rational surfaces at a given operating beta possible. Additionally, we have found configurations with NCSX-like characteristics but with the biased components in the magnetic spectrum that allow us to improve the confinement of energetic particles. For each new class of configurations, we have designed coils as well to ensure that the new configurations are realizable and engineering-wise feasible. The coil designs typically have coil aspect ratios R/{Delta}{sub min}(C-P) {le} 6 and coil separation ratios R/{Delta}{sub min}(C-C) {le} 10, where R is the plasma major radius, {Delta}{sub min}(C-P) and {Delta}{sub min}(C-C) are the minimum coil to plasma and coil to coil separations, respectively.

40|$|An {{oscillating}} multiple limiter {{concept for}} tokamak fusion reactors has been conceived and {{reported in this}} note. The limiters consist of half circle or short arc segments in the poloidal direction. They are oscillated locally in the scrape-off layer. Each limiter will be alternately {{in contact with the}} plasma for 50 ms or less at an interval of 0. 5 sec. It has been shown that the limiter can be subjected to a transcient heat load as high as 10 kW/cm 2 during the exposure time and can be cooled by water or helium in 0. 5 sec during the off-time. Only a few cm of movement is needed. A simple driving mechanism is also proposed. I In the major tokamak devices the limiters are often damaged by high heat load from the plasma.

40|$|To step up {{from current}} day fusion {{experiments}} to <b>power</b> <b>producing</b> fusion <b>reactors,</b> {{it is necessary to}} control long pulse, burning plasmas. Stability and confinement properties of tokamak fusion reactors are determined by the current or q profile. In order to control the q profile, it is necessary to measure it in real-time. A real-time motional Stark effect diagnostic is being developed at Korean Superconducting Tokamak for Advanced Research for this purpose. This paper focuses on 3 topics important for real-time measurements: minimize the use of ad hoc parameters, minimize external influences and a robust and fast analysis algorithm. Specifically, we have looked into extracting the retardance of the photo-elastic modulators from the signal itself, minimizing the influence of overlapping beam spectra by optimizing the optical filter design and a multi-channel, multiharmonic phase locking algorithm...|$|R
