5|$|The {{clitoral}} hood {{projects at}} the front of the labia commissure, where the edges of the labia majora (outer lips) meet at the base of the pubic mound; it forms as part of the external folds of the labia minora (inner lips) and covers the glans and external shaft. There is considerable variation in how much of the glans <b>protrudes</b> <b>from</b> the hood and how much is covered by it, ranging from completely covered to fully exposed, and tissue of the labia minora also encircles the base of the glans.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the species}} in the {{freshwater}} mussel family, Unionidae, commonly known as pocketbook mussels, have evolved an unusual reproductive strategy. The female's mantle <b>protrudes</b> <b>from</b> the shell and develops into an imitation small fish, complete with fish-like markings and false eyes. This decoy moves in the current and attracts the attention of real fish. Some fish see the decoy as prey, while others see a conspecific. They approach {{for a closer look}} and the mussel releases huge numbers of larvae from its gills, dousing the inquisitive fish with its tiny, parasitic young. These glochidia larvae are drawn into the fish's gills, where they attach and trigger a tissue response that forms a small cyst around each larva. The larvae then feed by breaking down and digesting the tissue of the fish within the cysts. After a few weeks they release themselves from the cysts and fall to the stream bed as juvenile molluscs. The fish are relatively unharmed.|$|E
5|$|The sparsely-spotted {{stingray}} {{has a more}} or less diamond-shaped {{pectoral fin}} disc wider than long, with rounded outer corners. The anterior margins of the disc are nearly straight and converge at an obtuse angle on the fleshy snout, the tip of which barely <b>protrudes</b> <b>from</b> the disc. The small eyes are immediately followed by comma-shaped spiracles with angular or rounded posterior rims. The outer rim of each nostril is enlarged into a knob towards the back. Between the nostrils is a bell-shaped curtain of skin with a finely fringed trailing margin; only the Kapala stingaree (U.kapalensis) has a similarly shaped nasal curtain. The small mouth contains five or six papillae (nipple-like structures) on the floor, most of which have forked tips. Additional small papillae are present {{on the outside of the}} lower jaw. The teeth in both jaws are small with roughly oval bases, and are arranged in a quincunx pattern. The five pairs of gill slits are short. The pelvic fins are small and rounded.|$|E

5|$|Aquatic life ties North American river otters almost {{exclusively}} to permanent watersheds. The river otters favor bog lakes with banked shores containing semiaquatic mammal burrows and lakes with beaver lodges. The otters avoid water bodies with gradually sloping shorelines of sand or gravel. In Maine, use of watersheds by river otters is negatively associated with the proportion of mixed hardwood-softwood stands in forested areas adjacent to waterways. However, it is positively associated {{with the number of}} beaver flowages, watershed length, and average shoreline diversity. In Idaho, river otters prefer valley habitats over mountainous terrain, and they select valley streams over valley lakes, reservoirs, and ponds. Log jams are heavily used when present. In Florida, inhabitation of North American river otters is lowest in freshwater marshes, intermediate in salt marshes, and highest in swamp forests. During the dry season, they will recede from the marshland and move to permanent ponds, where water is available and food is in greater supply. In Idaho and Massachusetts, ecological elements preferred for latrine sites include large conifers, points of land, beaver bank dens and lodges, isthmuses, mouths of permanent streams, or any object that <b>protrudes</b> <b>from</b> the water.|$|E
5|$|The Charles Payne House is a -story Gothic-Italianate vernacular cottage {{that has}} a spacious garden founded {{on the site of}} a long-removed house. The house's gable end faces the street with a rear ell and the other ell {{perpendicular}} to the main block on the west side. Centered on the east end of the roof is a cross gable which is visually offset by the dormer on the west. The house has a small gable-roofed vestibule on the east side, aligned underneath the cross-gable. The rear ell has an attached porch that spans its length. A single story bay hexagonal bay window <b>protrudes</b> <b>from</b> the facade. The distinguishing feature of the Payne house is the wood trim exterior, consisting of hood mould on the paired windows on the south, four kinds of bargeboards and bracketed cornices on the rear ell's east side. The interior of the Charles Payne House is not covered in detail by any survey, but has three mantelpieces on the first floor, two displaying Gothic Revival influence in their wooden designs and the third, located in the rear ell, made of grey marble with a round-head opening. Though not mentioned in the nomination, a photo shows one of the wooden mantlepieces filled with brick and rendered unusable at the time. The setting of the house was important to the National Register nomination, which specifically highlighted its shaded garden and fencing. At the time of the nomination, an ornamental round head picket fence surrounded the property and access was through a double-leaf lattice work gate. By 2013, the picket fence and entrance gate had been removed, but the property still retains the street frontage for its garden.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{grass cover}} under the canopy {{to the west}} and south of the tree, and sparse ground cover near the fence lines of both the railway yard and private property. Leaf litter covers most of the ground surface beneath the canopy. The tree root system <b>protrudes</b> <b>from</b> the trunk and surface roots are evident {{to the west and}} south of the trunk.|$|E

25|$|The old {{part of the}} city, {{where the}} port and {{fortified}} city were located, <b>protrudes</b> <b>from</b> the coastline, exposing {{both sides of the}} narrow piece of land to the sea. This could maximize its efficiency as a port, and the narrow entrance to this protrusion served as a natural and easy defense to the city. Both the archaeological record and Crusader texts emphasize Acre's strategic importance—a city in which it was crucial to pass through, control, and, as evidenced by the massive walls, protect.|$|E
25|$|One pair of antennae, {{each with}} five segments, <b>protrudes</b> <b>from</b> the insect's head. Head lice also have {{one pair of}} eyes. Eyes are present in all species within the Pediculidae (the family of which the head louse is a member), but are reduced or absent in most {{other members of the}} Anoplura suborder. Like other members of the Anoplura, head lice mouth parts are highly adapted for {{piercing}} skin and sucking blood. These mouth parts are retracted into the insect's head except during feeding.|$|E
25|$|The South Station head {{house and}} wings {{incorporate}} Neoclassical architecture. The building's symmetry and stone façade {{are common to}} the style. The granite came from nearby quarries in New England. The main doorways are located in a section that <b>protrudes</b> <b>from</b> the curving shape of the building. The doors are housed under tall arches that {{give the impression of}} grandeur while also making the building appear smaller from far away. This visual trick is common in classical buildings and is further amplified by the oversized windows and large balustrade on the third floor and roof.|$|E

25|$|The knife also {{features}} a glass-breaker, but unlike many other glass-breakers on folding knives, the tip {{is part of the}} blade itself which <b>protrudes</b> <b>from</b> the pivot side when the knife is closed. The Umnumzaan also was the first Chris Reeve folding knife to incorporate a lanyard pivot joint, which dramatically reduces the friction wear that over time destroys paracord lanyards. It also allows easy swapping of lanyards without a need to cut and retie if the owner has multiple lanyard pivots (referred to as a “cord tie bar” by Chris Reeve Knives). The lanyard pivot joint has since been incorporated on the Sebenza Classic 2000, Sebenza 21, and Sebenza 25.|$|E
25|$|When {{the male}} accepts female courting, the female expels eggs from the urogenitial papilla. Female Banggai {{cardinalfish}} produce {{a relatively small}} clutch, consisting {{of no more than}} ninety eggs that are two to three millimeters in diameter. Once approximately three-fourths of the egg mass <b>protrudes</b> <b>from</b> the female, the male takes the eggs from her. This process is immediate, taking no more than two seconds. Eggs may be lost in the process if the male drops them, as it is usually immediately consumed by other fish in the area. Males also have the ability to detect dead eggs and expel them from his mouth. The male broods the eggs in his mouth for up to 30 days, during which it does not feed. After spawning, the female stays with the brooding male for at least few days. Females aggressively defend its territory by immediately chasing any intruders that approach the brooding male. They also exhibit relaxed form of ‘side by side trembling’, and confine the male to a small space.|$|E
25|$|Superficially, they {{resemble}} the anteaters of South America and other spiny mammals such as hedgehogs and porcupines. They are usually black or brown in colour. There {{have been several}} reports of albino echidnas, their eyes pink and their spines white. They have elongated and slender snouts that function as both mouth and nose. Like the platypus, they are equipped with electrosensors, but while the platypus has 40,000 electroreceptors on its bill, the long-beaked echidna has only 2,000 electroreceptors, and the short-beaked echidna, which lives in a drier environment, has no more than 400 located {{at the tip of}} its snout. They have very short, strong limbs with large claws, and are powerful diggers. Echidnas have tiny mouths and toothless jaws. The echidna feeds by tearing open soft logs, anthills and the like, and using its long, sticky tongue, which <b>protrudes</b> <b>from</b> its snout, to collect prey. The echidnas' ears are slits on the sides of their heads that are usually unseen {{due to the fact that}} they are blanketed by their spines. The external ear is created by a large cartilaginous funnel, deep in the muscle.|$|E

40|$|Endometrial polyps {{are most}} {{commonly}} {{seen in the}} postmenopausal women with uterine bleeding, although the giant polyps which originate from the uterine cavity and <b>protruding</b> <b>from</b> the cervical os are rare. Several cases which have been described in the literature are usually developed secondary to tamoxifen use, and the polyps do not extend or <b>protrude</b> <b>from</b> the external cervical os. Most of the polyps <b>protruded</b> <b>from</b> the cervical os can mimic a cervical neoplasia or endocervical polyp. We report {{the case of a}} giant endometrial polyp (8 x 4 x 3 cm in size) which was <b>protruding</b> <b>from</b> the external cervical os and that developed spontaneously without tamoxifen use in a multiparous 73 -year-old woman presenting with vaginal bleeding. Hysteroscopic polypectomy was performed and no recurrence was seen at 6 months after surgery. Diagnosis, management and outcome of this rare entity have been discussed according to the literature...|$|R
500|$|Seed {{germination}} is adjacent ligular—during germination, as the cotyledon expands it only {{pushes a}} portion of the embryo out of the seed. [...] As a result, the seedling develops adjacent to the seed. [...] The embryo forms a ligule, and the plumule <b>protrudes</b> <b>from</b> this. [...] Seedlings in cultivation are reported to begin producing a stem two years after germination, at the point where they produce their thirteenth leaf.

500|$|Behind the Mother-of-Pearl Throne is the Phra Banchon Busabok Mala Throne (พระบัญชรบุษบกมาลา; [...] ). This half throne <b>protrudes</b> <b>from</b> the {{southern}} {{wall of the}} throne hall and opens like {{a window into the}} hall. The style of the throne is similar to Busabok Mala Throne on the porch outside.

500|$|The one-story {{building}} has no basement and originally consisted {{of only the}} house and canopy portion, and three Texaco gas pumps. The house, or main office portion of the station includes the interior office and the men's and women's restrooms. The men's restroom is accessed from the interior office and the women's restroom is accessed via an outside door {{on the south side}} of the building. The original [...] "LADIES" [...] sign still <b>protrudes</b> <b>from</b> the wall above the entrance. The entire house section of the station is 23 feet (7.0 m) by 14feet (4.3m). The exterior of the building is wood and sided with clapboard, save the garage bay area which is concrete block. The bay was built during World War II, between 194145, and material shortages forced the use of the differing building material.|$|E
