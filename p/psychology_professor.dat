Tara Kapoor Desphande (Kalki Koechlin), a young advertising agent, also arrives at the hospital during the night after being delivered news of a car accident involving her husband, Rajat Deshpande (Arjun Mathur). She is consoled by Rajat's eccentric co-worker Girish (Rajeev Ravindranathan), but dismisses him abruptly. Tara is deeply disturbed to see Rajat breathing on a ventilator, and leaves immediately.|$|E
5|$|During the Red Scare, <b>psychology</b> <b>professor</b> Harry C. Steinmetz {{was accused}} of being a Communist. San Diego representatives persuaded the California {{legislature}} along with Governor Earl Warren to attempt to remove him from his teaching position. After the State Board of Education was unable to get an answer from Steinmetz about {{whether or not he was}} a Communist, he was dismissed on February 5, 1954. He attempted to be reinstated but never was even after the legislation that had been developed during the Red Scare was later deemed unconstitutional.|$|E

40|$|Canadian {{clinical}} <b>psychology</b> <b>professors</b> {{in programs}} accredited by the Canadian Psychological Association (CPA) are generally expected {{to perform in}} 3 major domains–research, teaching, and service. Measurement of performance in these domains is complicated. Research productivity, as measured by publication and citation counts, are often touted as objective metrics for evaluating professorial research performance; however, such quantifications can be problematic. Despite concerns, evaluators continue to use publication and citation counts for evaluating <b>psychology</b> <b>professors.</b> Use of these metrics without normative data is extremely problematic; moreover, without ceiling reference points or identification of outliers, new professors and those evaluating them have no perspective on reasonable expectations. The current study provides normative data and ceiling reference points using publically available data for the 255 professors currently in CPA-accredited Canadian clinical psychology programs, as well as submissions from an invited subset of those same professors. The data were stratified by professorial rank and sex, with {{the men and women}} having the highest publication and citation counts identified to create ceiling references. The results suggest that most CPA-accredited Canadian clinical <b>psychology</b> <b>professors</b> publish between 0 and 4 articles annually. Men publish significantly more than women at the Assistan...|$|R

A composite sketch was printed in regional newspapers and broadcast on local television stations. Elizabeth Kloepfer, Ann Rule, a DES employee, and a UW <b>psychology</b> <b>professor</b> all recognized the profile, the sketch, and the car, and reported Bundy as a possible suspect; but detectives—who were receiving up to 200 tips per day—thought it unlikely that a clean-cut law student with no adult criminal record could be the perpetrator.|$|E

The app is designed to motivate users to save money through a gamification of their spending behavior. It moves money from a user's checking account to a separate Qapital account, when certain rules are triggered. Its database is used by <b>psychology</b> <b>professor</b> Dan Ariely to study consumer behavior. Qapital was released in Sweden in 2013, then in the US in early 2015.

40|$|Journals can be {{powerful}} teaching tools. However, as we learned during our {{first few years}} of using them, journals should not be blindly imported into psychology classes from composition classes. Instead, modifications should be made to accommodate the dif-ferences between the <b>psychology</b> <b>professor's</b> goals and the com-position teacher's goals. After consulting the psychological liter-ature and 3 years of tinkering, we found two modifications that seem to encourage students to think critically about the facts and ideas presented in psychology classes. We are indebted to English professors for introducing us to journals and giving us the benefits of their experiences. However, their experiences teaching students writing skills and self-exmession are not entirelv relevant to our situation.

5|$|The {{premise of}} the series is that Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is a Slayer, endowed with superhuman {{strength}} to fight vampires and evil creatures in the fictional town of Sunnydale. In the fourth season, Buffy begins attending college, where she discovers that her <b>psychology</b> <b>professor,</b> Walsh, is a scientist for the Initiative. Adam is Dr. Walsh's horrible masterpiece, an allusion to Frankenstein's monster, whose first conscious act is killing his creator. Adam's search for understanding himself and his true nature, combined for his penchant for chaos, leads him to orchestrate a massacre between demons and humans, after which {{he will be able}} use body parts left over from the melee to create an army of monsters to set loose on Sunnydale. Buffy's effectiveness as a Slayer is increased because her close friends and family, called the Scooby Gang, assist her in her battles. By the end of season four the members of the group have become estranged and must come back together in order to defeat the apparently invincible Adam.|$|E
