2500|$|Although it {{considered}} {{creation of a}} separate aviation department to act as the centralized authority for decision-making, both the War and the Navy Departments opposed it, and on October 1, 1917, Congress instead legalized {{the existence of the}} APB and changed its name to the [...] "Aircraft Board", transferring its functions from the Council of National Defense to the secretaries of War and the Navy. Even so, the Aircraft Board in practice had little control over <b>procurement</b> <b>contracts</b> and functioned mostly as an information provider between industrial, governmental, and military entities. Nor did the [...] "Equipment Division" [...] of the Signal Corps exercise such control. Established by the Office of the Chief Signal Officer (OCSO) as one of the operating components of the Aviation Section, its task was to unify and coordinate the various agencies involved but its head was a commissioned former member of the APB who did nothing to create any effective coordination. Moreover, the largely wood and fabric airframe designs of World War I did not lend themselves to being made with the mass production methods of the automotive industry, which used considerable amounts of metallic materials instead, and the priority of mass producing spare parts was neglected. Though individual areas within the aviation industry responded well, the industry as a whole failed. Efforts to mass produce European aircraft under license largely failed because the aircraft, made by hand, were not amenable to the more precise American manufacturing methods. At the same time the Aeronautical Division of the OCSO was renamed the Air Division with continued responsibility for training and operations but with no influence on acquisition or doctrine. In the end the decision-making process in aircraft procurement was badly fragmented and production on a large scale proved impossible.|$|E

The article is based upon a quantitative analysis of 180 questionnaire responses provided by <b>procurement</b> and <b>contract</b> managers. The results are not totally conclusive, but do provide evidence to suggest that opportunism is a significant possibility, and that certain <b>procurement</b> and <b>contract</b> management actions can assist organisations in dealing with that possibility.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{comparative}} {{study in which}} the rights of tenderers and contractors and related procurement regulations are discussed and compared under Saudi public <b>procurement</b> <b>contract</b> regulations and those of England and Wales. This thesis does not aim to be a comprehensive comparative study, but presents examples to illustrate the issues under discussion. A central aim {{of the study is}} to consider whether Saudi public <b>procurement</b> <b>contract</b> regulations are suitable {{to protect the rights of}} tenderers and contractors and to solve their problems in the rapid development of the country. Is the Purchasing Law, in particular, able to cover the rapid development in procurement and the economy in Saudi Arabia and the world? This question is asked in order to examine the weaknesses of current procurement regulations and to explore procurement claims that the Purchasing Law fails to address tenderers' and contractors' rights and concerns. Many criticisms have been raised regarding Saudi public <b>procurement</b> <b>contract</b> regulations, especially the Saudi Purchasing Law. Although the Saudi government has called for the procurement sector to play a greater role in national development, the Purchasing Law does not support this aim. It has remained unchanged since it was enacted in 1979, despite rapid economic changes in the country. Contractors, traders, banks, and Saudi Chambers of Commerce have complained that they are too constrained by the provisions of the Purchasing Law. The ten chapters of this thesis examine the rights of procurement tenderers and contractors throughout the procedures to prepare and award a public <b>procurement</b> <b>contract.</b> In addition to identifying the principles of procurement regulations, this study investigates the rights of tenderers and contractors from the first steps of tendering procedures to the awarding of the contract and afterwards. Once the contracting authority selects a successful contractor this study highlights his rights to obtain his financial payment and to obtain remedy if the contracting authority breaches its contractual obligations. The study examines case law, procurement regulations, circulars and governmental procedures in procurement. The study results indicate that Saudi public <b>procurement</b> <b>contract</b> regulations in general and the Purchasing Law in particular are inadequate to keep pace with development requirements in the country. More specifically, the findings show that current Saudi procurement regulations are in fact obstacles to the development of the procurement sector, and a main reason for contractors' unwillingness to enter the governmental procurement market.
