6000|$|That {{there must}} be a limit to the {{accumulation}} of capital is obvious. The downward course of the rate of interest, notwithstanding that many new employments have been made possible for capital, indicates how large is the increase of surplus value. This decline of the interest rate is in accord with Bohm-Bawerk's law of [...] "diminishing returns." [...] That is, when capital, like anything else, has become over-plentiful, less lucrative use can only be found for the excess. This excess, not being able to earn so much as when capital was less plentiful, competes for safe investments and forces down the interest rate on all capital. Mr. Charles A. Conant has well described the keenness of the scramble for safe investments, even at the prevailing low rates of interest. At the close of the war with Turkey, the Greek loan, guaranteed by Great Britain, France, and Russia, was floated with striking ease. Regardless of the small return, the amount offered at Paris, (41,000,000 francs), was subscribed for twenty-three times over. Great Britain, France, Germany, Holland, and the Scandinavian States, of recent years, have all engaged in converting their securities from 5 <b>per</b> <b>cents</b> to 4 <b>per</b> <b>cents,</b> from 4.5 <b>per</b> <b>cents</b> to 3.5 <b>per</b> <b>cents,</b> and the 3.5 <b>per</b> <b>cents</b> into 3 <b>per</b> <b>cents.</b>|$|R
