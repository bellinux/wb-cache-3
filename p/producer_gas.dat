25|$|During both world wars, {{especially}} the World War II, {{the need for}} fuel produced by gasification reemerged due to the shortage of petroleum. Wood gas generators, called Gasogene or Gazogène, were used to power motor vehicles in Europe. By 1945 there were trucks, buses and agricultural machines that were powered by gasification. It is estimated that there were close to 9,000,000 vehicles running on <b>producer</b> <b>gas</b> all over the world.|$|E
25|$|The 1860s {{were the}} golden age of coal gas development. Scientists like Kekulé and Perkin cracked the secrets of organic {{chemistry}} to reveal how gas is made and its composition. From this came better gas plants and Perkin's purple dyes, such as Mauveine. In the 1850s, processes for making <b>Producer</b> <b>gas</b> and Water gas from coke were developed. Unenriched water gas may be described as Blue water gas (BWG).|$|E
25|$|Gasification is {{a process}} that {{converts}} organic or fossil fuel based carbonaceous materials into carbon monoxide, hydrogen and carbon dioxide. This is achieved by reacting the material at high temperatures (>700°C), without combustion, with a controlled amount of oxygen and/or steam. The resulting gas mixture is called syngas (from synthesis gas) or <b>producer</b> <b>gas</b> and is itself a fuel. The power derived from gasification and combustion of the resultant gas {{is considered to be a}} source of renewable energy if the gasified compounds were obtained from biomass.|$|E

2500|$|A major {{industrial}} source of CO is <b>producer</b> <b>gas,</b> a mixture containing mostly carbon monoxide and nitrogen, formed by combustion of carbon in air at high temperature {{when there is}} an excess of carbon. In an oven, air is passed through a bed of coke. The initially produced CO2 equilibrates with the remaining hot carbon to give CO. The reaction of CO2 with carbon to give CO is described as the Boudouard reaction. Above 800°C, CO is the predominant product: ...|$|E

5000|$|Fuel gas for {{industrial}} use was made using <b>producer</b> <b>gas</b> technology. <b>Producer</b> <b>gas</b> {{is made by}} blowing air through an incandescent fuel bed (commonly coke or coal) in a gas producer. The reaction of fuel with insufficient air for total combustion produces carbon monoxide (CO); this reaction is exothermic and self-sustaining. It was discovered that adding steam to the input air of a gas producer would increase the calorific value of the fuel gas by enriching it with CO and hydrogen (H2) produced by water gas reactions. <b>Producer</b> <b>gas</b> has a very low calorific value of because the calorific gases CO/H2 are diluted with lots of inert nitrogen (from air) and carbon dioxide (CO2) (from combustion) ...|$|E
