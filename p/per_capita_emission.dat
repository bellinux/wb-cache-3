An SEU is focused on permanently lowering overall energy use and limiting supply to renewable energy sources.

40|$|This paper uses a {{coalition}} formation model {{to explore how}} equity considerations affect countries’ cooperation on global environmental issues, e. g. on climate change. When developing countries are exempted from obligations to reduce their emissions, I find that opening them for abatement projects financed by industrialized countries changes the incentives to cooperate {{in a way which}} can increase emissions and decrease welfare. Equity- concerns in industrialized countries regarding the difference between their <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> <b>emission</b> levels and those of developing countries lead to increased abatement but do not qualitatively change the incentives to cooperate. Inequality-aversion with respect to differences to abatement targets across industrialized countries generally induces larger coalition sizes and stricter abatement. Here, the inclusion of developing countries improves upon the prospects of cooperation.

40|$|The lifecycle, {{sources and}} fate of perfluorooctane {{sulfonate}} (PFOS) continue to generate scientific and political interest, particularly since PFOS was listed by the Stockholm Convention and largely restricted in Europe. It {{continues to be}} detected in aquatic environments, with only limited studies into the on-going sources. This paper explores PFOS emissions discharged by the general population into a small catchment comprising two rivers in the UK. A sampling campaign was undertaken to improve our understanding of population-derived PFOS sources from sewage treatment plants (STPs) and in rivers. A corresponding modelling exercise allowed an emission estimate of 13 μg/day/per capita to be derived for the Aire and Calder rivers. PFOS emission was linked to STP discharges bylinear regression of measured and modelled concntrations (R 2 = 0. 49 – 0. 85). The model was able to accurately estimate the spatial trends of PFOS in the rivers, while predicted concentrations were within a factor of three based on <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> <b>emission</b> values taken from the literature. Measured PFOS concentrations in rivers suggested that emissions from STPs are partially dependent on treatment type, where plants with secondary or tertiary treatment such as activated sludge processes emit less PFOS, possibly due to increased partitioning and retention. With refinements based {{on the type of}} treatment at each STP, predictions were further improved. The total PFOS mass discharged annually via rivers from the UK has been estimated to be between 215 and 310 kg, based on the <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> <b>emission</b> range derived in this study...|$|E

The N 2 O emissions exclusively from the aeration tank represented 0. 10 % of the influent total nitrogen load and the <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> <b>emission</b> factor was almost 3 times higher than that suggested by the IPCC for inventories of N 2 O emission from WWTPs...|$|E

40|$|Poverty {{and equity}} are {{inextricably}} linked {{in the analysis}} of climate change and the global governance response.

A more pro-active negotiating strategy by poorer countries is needed to move closer to a solution based on <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> <b>emission</b> rights. The poorest countries are most vulnerable to the direct and indirect adverse impacts of climate change, and these threaten to undermine donor poverty reduction efforts.

We show that - contrary to the two-country-case - for the latter there is no uniform percentage reduction of emissions that makes all countries better off. Rather, equity oriented countries (for example developing countries) enter a coalition only {{if they do not}} have to reduce as much. While equity preferences improve upon the prospects of cooperation if countries are not too different with respect to their per capita levels, if countries differ largely in population size and per capita emissions, generally no coalition will be stable without restrictions on entry into or exit out of a coalition. In such a situation, equity-orientation does not improve upon the prospects for cooperation...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the validity of}} the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis for the case of China’s industrial SO 2 emission through both reduced and structural model. The estimated Chinaspecific EKC curve for per capital industrial SO 2 emission predicts the turning point of 9000 yuan (2750 USD, PPP). However, given China’s fast population expansion speed, the decreasing trend in the <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> <b>emission</b> will not bring an immediate reduction in total industrial SO 2 emission. Our structural EKC model succeeds in decomposing industrial SO 2 emission density into the contribution from its three famous structural determinants and a marginal impact from international trade. The latter is actually composed of a significantly negative direct impact and indirect ones going through the composition effect, which further depends on the current capital/labour abundance ratio and the actual income level of a province. : China, EKC, international trade, SO 2 emission, decomposition, pollution haven. ...|$|E
