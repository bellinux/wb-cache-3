40|$|The {{importance}} of biologically active carbohydrates {{has been recognized}} over the last decade. The availability of cheap oligosaccharides for biological activity studies is very reduced. The isolation of these compounds from natural sources is almost impossible, because of their very high specific activity. and consequently very low concentration in nature. As chemical synthesis is a difficult and time consuming, the enzymatic synthesis has been regarded {{over the last years}} as a very attractive methodology for oligosaccharide production. The main approach when utilizing glycanases for di- or trisaccharides synthesis has been the transglycosylation reaction. However, the isolation of products is quite complicated. On the other hand, the condensation reaction by reversed hydrolysis activity, which in many cases requires cheaper substrates. has a very low yield. In this work, a purified exoglucanase CBH I from the fungus Trichoderma reesei was analyzed for its reversed hydrolysis activity. The enzyme was purified by conventional methodologies (preparative isoelectric focusing, gel filtration on Sephacryl 100 HR, anionic exchange on a Mono Q column and cationic exchange on a Mono S column), from a commercial cellulase, Cellulast, from Novo.

40|$|Abstract. In this <b>paper,</b> <b>acid</b> {{protease}} {{treatment was}} studied on anti-felting finishing of wool knitted fabric and the optimal process conditions {{were obtained by}} orthogonal experiment. The technical parameters were hydrogen peroxide concentration 40 mL/L, temperature 45 ℃, time 45 min, pH value 8, concentration of protease 5 % (owf), pH value 5, temperature 40 ℃ and time 35 min. Through this process, the felt resistance property of wool knitted fabric has been improved greatly. Because of low temperature, energy consumption, environmental pollution, this process belongs to environmental protection and energy saving technology. Introdution Because of special superficial structure of wool fiber, wool knitted fabric is apt to felt. This felt performance has great influence on wool fabric handle and dimensional stability. Chlorination process has been widely used in traditional wool anti-felting treatment, but AOX generated in this process destroys the environment severely. With the increase {{of the environmental protection}} consciousness of people, the traditional methods of chlorination adding resin will be restricted in the future. So it is significant to develop and apply environment-friendly anti-felting process. For the past few years, enzyme has been widely used in the textile industry. Protease can be used to catalyzed hydrolyze peptides of wool and silk fiber, and considered the most promising alternative methods of wool chloride-resin anti-felting process [1]. Due to the effect of wool anti-felting is not satisfied by using protease alone, to enhance the reaction between protease and wool and improve wool anti-shrink effect, various oxidation pretreatment and reduction pretreatment are adopted [2]. At present, chlorinated pretreatment adding protease treatment anti-felting process has been used in many domestic factories. Considering of environmental protection, acid protease anti-felting process with hydrogen peroxide pretreatment was discussed in this paper. This process not only improves wool fabrics anti-felting performance but also not pollutes the environment...|$|E
