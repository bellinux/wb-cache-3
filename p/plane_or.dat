NASA did not approve the requested $715 million, {{and the future of}} the project is uncertain.|$|E

Here, M.alcathoe is usually found in stands of <b>plane</b> <b>or</b> alder trees next to small streams in ravines. The bat hunts close to the trees, within the stand. It is often found together with the lesser horseshoe bat and with M.mystacinus.|$|E
5|$|In July 2012, a Lebanese man was {{detained}} by Cyprus police on possible charges relating to terrorism laws for planning attacks against Israeli tourists. According to security officials, {{the man was}} planning attacks for Hezbollah in Cyprus and admitted this after questioning. The police were alerted about the man due to an urgent message from Israeli intelligence. The Lebanese man was in possession of photographs of Israeli targets and had information on Israeli airlines flying {{back and forth from}} Cyprus, and planned to blow up a <b>plane</b> <b>or</b> tour bus. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Iran assisted the Lebanese man with planning the attacks.|$|E
5000|$|The {{standard}} Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) cosmology contains seventeen Outer Planes. Cosmologically, {{they are}} arranged in a ring of sixteen planes with the Good-aligned <b>planes,</b> <b>or</b> Upper <b>Planes</b> at the top, and the Evil-aligned <b>planes,</b> <b>or</b> Lower <b>Planes</b> at the bottom. Depictions usually display the Lawful <b>planes</b> (<b>or</b> <b>Planes</b> of Law) to the left, and the Chaotic <b>planes</b> (<b>or</b> <b>Planes</b> of Chaos) to the right. Between all of these sit the Neutral <b>planes,</b> <b>or</b> the <b>Planes</b> of Conflict. One further plane sits in {{the centre of the}} ring, the Outlands, being neutral in alignment. At the center of the Outlands is a Spire of infinite height; the city of Sigil floats above the Spire's pinnacle. The standard D&D cosmology is the official cosmology used in the Planescape and Greyhawk campaign settings. Many of the alternative names derive from the 1st-edition Manual of the Planes (1987, [...] ), and the in-game explanation given in the Planescape setting is that these names are used by the [...] "Clueless", or characters from the Prime Material unfamiliar with the planes.|$|R

5|$|Vector spaces {{stem from}} affine {{geometry}} via {{the introduction of}} coordinates in the <b>plane</b> <b>or</b> three-dimensional space. Around 1636, Descartes and Fermat founded analytic geometry by equating solutions to an equation of two variables with points on a plane curve. In 1804, to achieve geometric solutions without using coordinates, Bolzano introduced certain operations on points, lines and planes, which are predecessors of vectors. His work was then used in the conception of barycentric coordinates by Möbius in 1827. In 1828 C. V. Mourey suggested {{the existence of an}} algebra surpassing not only ordinary algebra but also two-dimensional algebra created by him searching a geometrical interpretation of complex numbers.|$|E
5|$|Member of parliament, Inge Myrvoll, and {{president}} of the Norwegian Airline Pilots Association, Cpt.Peter Helland, both stated that the Accident Investigation Board should make a new inquiry about the accident. Cpt. Helland stated that the report's credibility was weakened due to the influence de Havilland Canada had during the process. On 10 June, the commission reopened the case, after having held meetings with Tyrer. The commission stated that there was disagreement as to if the tail rudder and tail <b>plane</b> <b>or</b> the end piece had cracked first, which would be crucial in determining the cause of the accident. Among the inquiries would be to re-investigate the tape of cockpit sound with new technology. The Accident Investigation Board used the National Aerospace Laboratory in the Netherlands to conduct tests on the end pieces. The report from the National Aerospace Laboratory was published on 23 March 1995, and supported the conclusion in the commissions report. The journalist Oddvar Kristoffersen in Fremover won the SKUP Award for 1994 for his work related to uncovering the controversy. The pilots' union in Widerøe was initially critical of the report, but by July it stated that it supported the conclusion. In addition, Det Norske Veritas withdrew its critical comments concerning the commission. With this, all officially involved parties supported the report.|$|E
5|$|More formally, a {{tessellation}} or tiling is a {{cover of}} the Euclidean plane by a countable number of closed sets, called tiles, such that the tiles intersect only on their boundaries. These tiles may be polygons or any other shapes. Many tessellations are formed from {{a finite number of}} prototiles in which all tiles in the tessellation are congruent to the given prototiles. If a geometric shape {{can be used as a}} prototile to create a tessellation, the shape is said to tessellate or to tile the plane. The Conway criterion is a sufficient but not necessary set of rules for deciding if a given shape tiles the plane periodically without reflections: some tiles fail the criterion but still tile the plane. No general rule has been found for determining if a given shape can tile the <b>plane</b> <b>or</b> not, which means there are many unsolved problems concerning tessellations.|$|E

5|$|The {{inclination}} of {{a planet}} tells how far above or below an established reference plane its orbit lies. In the Solar System, the reference plane is the plane of Earth's orbit, called the ecliptic. For extrasolar planets, the plane, known as the sky <b>plane</b> <b>or</b> plane of the sky, is the plane perpendicular to the observer's line of sight from Earth. The eight planets of the Solar System all lie {{very close to the}} ecliptic; comets and Kuiper belt objects like Pluto are at far more extreme angles to it. The points at which a planet crosses above and below its reference plane are called its ascending and descending nodes. The longitude of the ascending node is the angle between the reference plane's 0 longitude and the planet's ascending node. The argument of periapsis (or perihelion in the Solar System) is the angle between a planet's ascending node and its closest approach to its star.|$|E
