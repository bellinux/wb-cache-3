5|$|On July 26, 1846, Bishop Bourget {{unilaterally}} {{opened the}} noviciate of the Saint-Pélagie Community, {{and placed the}} assembled female staff of the Hospice as novices within that <b>program.</b> <b>This</b> effectively established the Hospice de Saint-Pélagie as a religious community, of which Bourget proclaimed Sophie Raymond to be the superior. It also allowed for women to join the community as postulants, {{with the aim of}} eventually taking religious vows. Bourget designated himself spiritual and canonical director of the novitiate, and delegated a priest, the Abbé Antoine Rey, to be Director of the Hospice. Later that year at the direction of Coadjutor Bishop Jean-Charles Prince (later Bishop of Saint-Hyacinth) the Wolfe Street premises were expanded through the acquisition of the first floor adjacent to the hospice.|$|E

The telemetry station received investments of NOK100 million during the 1980s and was organized as a foundation in 1984. It took the name Tromsø Satellite Station in 1988. Part of the goal of the project was to create technical spin-offs; the one successful company was Spacetec, which had 45 employees {{at the time it was}} bought by Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace in 1994.

In Woody Allen's live-action film Annie Hall (1977), Alvy mentions that when he saw Disney's Snow White, he was attracted to the Queen while all the other children had a crush on Snow White. This is followed by an animated sequence of the Wicked Queen, resembling Annie and voiced by Diane Keaton, talking to the cartoon version of the daydreaming Alvy, but turns out that even the Queen scolds him; Alvy attributes it to her having her period mood, to which the Queen reminds him she is just a cartoon character.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the eastern}} portion of West Virginia was {{declared}} a federal disaster area on November 7, 1985. Within {{two weeks of the}} declaration, the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) began clearing debris across the state, which was completed by July 1986. Widespread areas were under a boil-water advisory due to damage to water facilities, prompting officials to deliver trucks with bottled water through disaster areas. The state's highway department worked with FEMA and the USACE to clear destroyed buildings. Workers also buried killed animals, cleared blocked streams, and helped farmers regrow lost crops. FEMA opened 20disaster centers across the state to coordinate residents' requests for federal aid, and used 290 full or part-time employees. Overall federal assistance totaled $285million, including $171million for debris removal and repairing infrastructure, $90million for loans and temporary housing, and $24million through payments from the National Flood Insurance <b>Program.</b> <b>This</b> followed a six-week period when applications for such assistance were processed. After receiving complaints about inadequate funding, FEMA increased payments to 869people. FEMA also built 647temporary mobile homes, only about half of which were utilized. Residents complained that the money spent on the homes was misdirected and instead should have been given directly to victims. Many residents in Albright moved away after the main industry - river rafting - was washed away. In the city of Parsons, most businesses relied on small business loans to continue operating, although 18stores never reopened following the floods. Officials held a telethon on state television and radio on December7, 1985, that ultimately raised $1.7million for storm victims in the state. In the years after the flood, residents rebuilt houses farther away from flood plains, while officials rebuilt roads, bridges, and public buildings.|$|E
