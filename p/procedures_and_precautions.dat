50|$|The USNRC {{provides}} licensing for the entombment process, as well {{as providing}} license they research and develop programs to help decommission nuclear power plants. USNRC will continue the development of rule making for entombment. NRC will ask the company that are running power plants to set some money aside while the power plant is being run for future shut down cost. The NRC has decided that in order for nuclear entombment to be a possible, a long-term structure must be created specifically for the encasing of the radioactive waste. If the structures are not correctly built water can seep into them and come out with radioactive waste that can infect the public. The NRC itself imposes acts such as the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and the Low-level radioactive waste policy to help regulate state governments on the <b>procedures</b> <b>and</b> <b>precautions</b> needed to dispose of the nuclear waste. The Nuclear Waste Policy of 1982 states that both the federal government's are responsible to provide a permanent disposal facility for high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel. As well with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, which gives states the responsibility to dispose of low-level waste and provides facilities to the states that will be regulated by the NRC or by states who have agreed to follow §274 of the Atomic Energy Act.|$|E

40|$|Trees in greenspaces are an {{indicator}} of a city's livability and sustainability. Roadside trees furnish linear greenery that can permeate neighborhoods and serve landscape and amenity functions. They are subject to high-intensity stresses and often perform poorly. Trenching to reach or install utilities along pavements is {{a major cause of}} tree damage and subsequent decline. Erroneously, it has been believed that roots grow mainly downwards and hence trenching near a tree is relatively harmless to roots. Although modern research confirms the shallow but wide distribution of tree roots that can be seriously damaged by trenching, old trenching practice still persists in many cities. Installing cable television and optical-fiber networks, and the need to overhaul dilapidated utility lines in old cities, could bring massive damage to roadside trees and significantly degrade cityscape quality. Recent advances in trenchless technology could merge with the new understanding of root distribution to protect this valuable municipal asset. Utility pipes or cables could be inserted below or around the root envelope in a drilled or bored channel, while extant pipe channels could be used to rehabilitate an old line. The <b>procedures</b> <b>and</b> <b>precautions</b> for the application of trenchless methods on narrow pavements are proposed. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Marine Information Bulletin is to remind shipowners, masters, crews, {{accredited}} persons and marine officers of the hazards found on board ships, in particular the high risk associated with confined spaces {{and the importance of}} using appropriate procedures to provide for safe entry. Background Failure to adopt a systematic and careful approach to confined space entry can result in injury and death. Multiple fatalities have occurred in confined spaces especially when rescuers fail to assess the risk and take appropriate steps. Confined space hazards are not confined to toxic or oxygen depleted atmospheres. There are many different kinds of confined spaces on board ships such as sealed void spaces, fuel tanks, sullage tanks, battery storage compartments, and compartments where explosive gases may accumulate due to construction work. There have been circumstances where workers or contractors have risked serious injury as a result of not having equipment isolated when working in a confined space. The level of risk will vary considerably depending {{on the nature of the}} space, the material contained within the space and the hazard control arrangements. As a consequence the <b>procedures</b> <b>and</b> <b>precautions</b> required will depend on the nature of the space and the level of the hazard present...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1990 The {{rainbow trout}} (Oncorhynchus mykiss) model of {{chemical}} carcinogenesis {{is becoming increasingly}} important {{as a supplement to}} rodent studies. However, much of the molecular biology of the carcinogenic response is still unknown in the trout model. The ras gene family has been implicated in the tumorigenesis of both spontaneous and chemically-induced tumors in mammals. This study is the first to characterize a ras proto-oncogene in rainbow trout. To accomplish this, the ras gene sequence was amplified in vitro by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Two synthetic and degenerative oligonucleotide sequences based on a consensus mammal/goldfish ras sequence were used as primers in the PCR procedure. An 800 base pair (bp) sequence was amplified from trout genomic DNA and hybridized with a human c-Ha-ras sequence. The initial amplifications of trout liver cDNA using the PCR procedure with the synthetic ras primers resulted in a single product of approximately 216 bps. However, this amplified "trout" 216 by product was subsequently shown to be an artifact of carryover from a human Ki-ras plasmid. Carryover is a common problem found in many laboratories involved with the PCR <b>procedure,</b> <b>and</b> extensive <b>precautions</b> were used to eliminate the problem in our laboratories.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{equipment}} available for evaluating frost hardiness of forest tree planting stock. The <b>procedures</b> <b>and</b> <b>precautions</b> necessary in under-taking such work are also outlined. The {{most common and}} accessible method of evaluating frost hardiness is to raise plants at one or more field sites where plants grow, harden and freeze naturally. However, the frequency and severity of frosts {{in the field are}} unpredictable and uncontrollable. To overcome these problems various commercial cold rooms and cabinets, often modified to provide controlled rates of freezing and thawing, have been used. In some cases these cabinets are portable to allow field plants to be frosted in situ. Freezing bars have also been developed which allow samples of plants to be frosted over a range of temperatures at the same time. Recently, specialised radiation and advective frost rooms have been designed which, although costly to construct and operate, provide very precise, controlled and reproducible ''natural " frosts. Most techniques can distinguish differences in frost tolerance between plants, but only those providing control of all phases of the frost treatment will allow the results to be extrapolated confidently from laboratory to the field. Access to more than one frost temperature is essential if differences in frost tolerance are to be quantified. The final test of the frost tolerance of forest planting stock, however, must remain its performance in the field...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{nosocomial}} infections surveillance {{system must be}} strongly effective especially in highly critic areas, such as Intensive Care Units (ICU). These areas are frequently an epidemiological epicentre for transmission of multi-resistant pathogens, like Acinetobacter baumannii. As an epidemic outbreak occurs {{it is very important}} to confirm or exclude the genetic relationship among the isolates in a short time. There are several molecular typing systems used with this aim. The Repetitive sequence-based PCR (REP-PCR) has been recognized as an effective method and it was recently adapted to an automated format known as the DiversiLab system. Methods In the present study we have evaluated the combination of a newly introduced software package for the control of hospital infection (VIGI@ct) with the DiversiLab system. In order to evaluate the reliability of the DiversiLab its results were also compared with those obtained using f-AFLP. Results The combination of VIGI@ct and DiversiLab enabled an earlier identification of an A. baumannii epidemic cluster, through the confirmation of the genetic relationship among the isolates. This cluster regards 56 multi-drug-resistant A. baumannii isolates from several specimens collected from 13 different patients admitted to the ICU in a ten month period. The A. baumannii isolates were clonally related being their similarity included between 97 and 100 %. The results of the DiversiLab were confirmed by f-AFLP analysis. Conclusion The early identification of the outbreak has led to the prompt application of operative <b>procedures</b> <b>and</b> <b>precautions</b> to avoid the spread of pathogen. To date, 6 months after the last A. baumannii isolate, no other related case has been identified. </p...|$|E
30|$|Proper quality {{assurance}} <b>procedures</b> <b>and</b> <b>precautions</b> {{were taken to}} ensure {{the reliability of the}} results. The samples were carefully handled to avoid any external influences that could interfere with the integrity of the sample and hence contaminate it. All glassware’s were rigorously washed with detergent, rinsed with distilled water, thoroughly rinsed with analytical grade acetone and dried overnight in an oven at 150  °C. The glassware’s were then removed from the oven and allowed to cool down and stored in dust-free cabinets. Deionized water was used throughout the study. For the spectrophotometric analysis, reagent blank determinations were used to correct the instrument readings. For validation of the analytical procedure, repeated analysis of the samples against internationally certified/standard reference material (SRM- 1570) of National Institute of Standard and Technology were used. The quality of organophosphorus pesticide residues was assured through the analysis of solvent blanks, procedural matrix blanks and duplicate samples. All reagents used during the analysis were exposed to same extraction procedures and subsequently run to check for interfering substances. In the blank for each extraction procedure, no pesticide was detected. A sample of each series was analysed in duplicates. All extracts were kept frozen until quantification was done. Recalibration curves were run with each batch of samples to check that the correlation coefficient was kept around r 2  =  0.99. A fortification level of 0.01  mg/kg for soil and 0.01  µg/L for water were chosen before the analysis to evaluate the recovery of the compounds in both soil and water samples. The efficiency of the analytical methods (the extraction and clean-up methods) was determined by recoveries of an internal standard. The recoveries of internal standards ranged between 70 and 94  % for all the organophosphorus pesticide analysed. These recovery values shows that the method used is reproducible.|$|E

The use of simulation and analysis methodologies gives opportunity to the staff officers and the commanders to foresee the results of their plans and to take some precautions accordingly. Different combat scenarios can be tried without deploying the units to the combat area and getting losts, costs and risks. As one of the most complicated and decisive operation in the way to victory “Air assault operations” are high risk, high payoff operations, that, when properly planned and vigorously executed, allow commanders to take the initiative of the combat area. The use of Air Assault Operations Simulation Model (AAOSM) allows planners: (1) to build models of air assault operations early in the decision process and refine those models as their decision process evolve, (2) perform “Bottleneck analysis” of the preplanned operation using statistical <b>procedures</b> <b>and</b> take some <b>precautions</b> accordingly.
