40|$|During {{the past}} decade, nine {{patients}} with bacterial endocarditis have required management of mycotic emboli and/or aneurysms in this center. In these patients, 25 separate mycotic emboli or aneurysms were identified. Among these were four visceral, 11 lower extremity, one aortic, one hypogastric, and eight cerebral lesions. Multiple sites {{were involved in}} seven of the nine patients (78 %). Presenting symptoms were secondary to acute expansion of mycotic aneurysms in three patients and secondary to rupture of aneurysms in four patients. Mycotic emboli produced cerebral infarction in two patients and acute ischemia in six patients. Asymptomatic mycotic aneurysms of the middle cerebral, hepatic, hypogastric, and <b>profunda</b> <b>femoris</b> <b>arteries</b> and asymptomatic emboli to the <b>profunda</b> <b>femoris</b> and tibial <b>arteries</b> were found during angiographic study. Management included resection alone (7 aneurysms), resection and graft replacement (2 aneurysms and 2 emboli), embolectomy (2), or observation. There was no mortality or loss of limb in these patients. This experience underscores the frequent multiplicity of mycotic emboli and/or aneurysms and {{stresses the importance of}} empiric angiographic survey to exclude silent yet potentially lethal visceral and cerebral mycotic foci in patients with bacterial endocarditis and peripheral emboli or aneurysms...|$|R
40|$|Femoral {{pseudoaneurysm}} is {{a serious}} complication in drug addicts who habitually inject via the groin. A total of 33 drug addicts presenting with 34 infected femoral pseudoaneurysms were treated in the Department of Surgery, the University of Hong Kong, Queen Mary Hospital from July 1993 to June 1996. There were 27 men and 6 women, with ages ranging from 23 to 76 years (mean 39. 6 years). Positive intraoperative tissue cultures were seen m 29 (85 %), with 17 being pure growth of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). Twenty-four pseudoaneurysms involved the femoral bifurcation and were treated by triple ligation of the common femoral, superficial femoral, and <b>profunda</b> <b>femoris</b> <b>arteries.</b> Seven other limbs underwent ligation of the common femoral artery alone, and three had superficial femoral artery ligation. Nineteen limbs had the external iliac artery ligated {{in addition to the}} femoral ligation for better proximal control. The mean postoperative ankle-brachial index (ABI) was 0. 43 and 0. 52 in those with triple ligation and those with single-vessel ligation, respectively. There was no hospital mortality, and all patients were discharged with a viable limb. The duration of follow-up ranged from 2 to 36 months (mean 15. 5 months). Four patients were asymptomatic, but the rest suffered some degree of intermittent claudication. No delayed limb loss was identified. We conclude that systemic antibiotics active against MSSA are the antibiotics of choice in drug addicts with infected fernoral pseudoaneurysms. Ligation and excision of the pseudoaneurysm without revascularization is safe, with acceptable morbidity and a low limb loss rate. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Physical examination {{in the emergency room}} demonstrated a palpable left femoral pulse and absent left popliteal, dorsalis pedis, and pos-terior tibial artery pulses. The left foot and lower leg were pale and cool to touch, and the patient exhibited di-minished sensation over the anterior foot and decreased mobility at the an-kle joint. Vascular examination of the right lower extremity was entirely nor-mal. Past medical history was remark-able only for recreational drug use consisting mainly of cocaine. An elec-trocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm and angiography was re-quested. Runoff arteriography was per-formed via a right femoral approach (Fig 1) and then a thoracic arteriogram was obtained (Fig 2). RADIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS The runoff arteriogram displays ab-normalities at multiple levels all con-fined to the left lower extremity. There is a well-circumscribed lobulated fill-ing defect in the distal left common femoral artery extending into the proximal superficial femoral (SFA) and <b>profunda</b> <b>femoris</b> <b>arteries</b> consis-tent with a saddle embolus (Fig 1 d, arrow). The profunda and SFA fill nor-mally beyond the occlusion. The left SFA and popliteal arteries are normal but there is abrupt occlusion of the tibioperoneal trunk at the origin of the peroneal (Fig 1 f, arrow) and abrupt occlusion of the anterior tibial artery in the mid-calf (Fig 1 g, arrow). There are no collateral vessels around any of the occlusions indicating that these find-ings are acute in nature. By compari-son, the right lower extremity runoff vessels are entirely normal. The thoracic and abdominal aorta are normal for the patient’s age with-out evidence of significant vascular disease (Fig 2). Specifically, there are no abnormalities in the thoracic or ab-dominal aorta to indicate a source for distal emboli...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: At arteria femoralis, arteria <b>profunda</b> <b>femoris</b> is {{the main}} branch feeding the thigh. After iliofemoral embryological {{evolution}} many variations {{can be seen in}} this vessel. The absence of a. <b>profunda</b> <b>femoris</b> is one of the rare seen variation among these variations. Knowing the anatomy and variations of a. <b>profunda</b> <b>femoris</b> well, is important in low extremity ischemia, vessel surgery and angiography applications. In this study, 1036 films belonging to low extremity found in the Radiology department of School of Medicine of Cumhuriyet University were examined as retrospective. Among these films at four of them of male cases, absence of a. <b>profunda</b> <b>femoris</b> was detected. In cases at ages of 32, 37, 47 and 53 respectively, in the first and second case at the right low extremity there was no a. <b>profunda</b> <b>femoris</b> and at the left low extremity it was seen that a. circumflexus femoris medialis and a. circumflexus femoris lateralis emerged from a. <b>profunda</b> <b>femoris.</b> In the third case it was detected that at left low extremity a. <b>profunda</b> <b>femoris</b> did not exist, and at right low extremity a. circumflexus femoris lateralis emerged from a. <b>profunda</b> <b>femoris,</b> and a. circumflexus femoris medialis emerged from a. femoralis. In the fourth case at left low extremity there was no a. <b>profunda</b> <b>femoris</b> and at right low extremity it was seen that at a. <b>profunda</b> <b>femoris</b> and a. femoralis were in unsteady course. The absence of a. <b>profunda</b> <b>femoris</b> had 0, 4 %. The results were discussed by comparing with literature data.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: To {{highlight}} {{a special}} subset {{of cases of}} venous stasis in which the <b>profunda</b> <b>femoris</b> vein enlarges to a variable extent (axial transformation) to compensate for severe postthrombotic changes in the accompanying superficial femoral vein. Methods: Among 500 consecutively treated patients with severe venous stasis, 57 patients had axial transformation of the <b>profunda</b> <b>femoris</b> vein. Venous obstruction and reflux were assessed by means of arm-foot pressure differential, ambulatory venous pressure measurement, air plethysmography, and duplex examination. Ascending and descending venograms also were obtained. A variety of valve reconstruction techniques were useful in correcting reflux in the enlarged <b>profunda</b> <b>femoris</b> vein and the companion postthrombotic superficial femoral vein. Results: In 55 % of patients the <b>profunda</b> <b>femoris</b> vein was larger than normal and provided partial outflow from the leg through a profunda-popliteal connection, but the superficial femoral vein was still the dominant outflow tract (grades I and II). In 36 % of patients the <b>profunda</b> <b>femoris</b> was the dominant outflow tract from the leg, and in another 9 % it was the sole axial outflow tract (grades III and IV). The skin changes of advanced venous stasis were present among 92 % of patients and frank ulceration among 88 %. Antireflux operations on the <b>profunda</b> <b>femoris</b> vein and companion superficial femoral vein, including ligation and division in some instances, were well tolerated. Despite a postthrombotic cause, obstruction did not worsen after surgical treatment, and reflux improved according to most laboratory measurements. Complete ulcer healing was obtained with the surgical techniques described. The actuarial recurrence-free survival rates were 90 % 1 year and 66 % 5 years after treatment. Conclusion: Axial transformation of the <b>profunda</b> <b>femoris</b> vein is present in a subset of instances in which severe postthrombotic changes {{are present in the}} companion superficial femoral vein. <b>Profunda</b> <b>femoris</b> reflux is invariably present in these instances because of compensatory dilatation and enlargement of this vessel. Simultaneous valve repair of the axially transformed <b>profunda</b> <b>femoris</b> vein and companion superficial femoral vein to abolish reflux yields excellent long-term results and healing of stasis ulceration.

40|$|The small Green Monkey (Cercopithecus aethiops sabeus) {{in large}} groups inhabits the African savannah. The animals {{delivered}} to us were from East Africa, that is from Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. The {{length of the}} animal is 110 cm, and the tail itself is 50 cm long. They can often be seen in Zoos. According to data, mostly by zoo gardens, these monkeys live for about 15 to 17 years, exceptionally for 20 years. The objective of our work was to investigate {{a part of their}} cardiovascular system so in that way to contribute to a better knowledge of this animal body structure and accordingly to comparative anatomy in general. The investigation included 6 Small Green Monkeys, of both gender, 3 - 4 years old, body weight 2000 - 3000 grams, obtained from The Institute for Virusology, vaccines and serums from Belgrade. For obtaining the hindlimb arterial vascularization, after exsanguination of the animal, contrast mass of gelatin coloured with tempera was injected into the abdominal aorta. After injecting, the blood vessels were prepared and photographed. In the Small Green Monkey, femoral artery (A. femoralis) is an continuation of the external iliac artery (A. iliaca externa). The branches of the femoral <b>artery</b> are: A. <b>profunda</b> <b>femoris,</b> A. saphena, A. genus descendens and A. caudalis femoralis. A. <b>profunda</b> <b>femoris</b> separates to A. circumflexa femoris lateralis, Ramus muscularis and A. circumflexa femoris medialis. In humans A. femoralis branches into: A. epigastrica superficialis, A. circumflexa ilium superficialis, Aa. pudendae externae, A. <b>profunda</b> <b>femoris</b> and A. genus descendens (A. descendens genus). A. <b>profunda</b> <b>femoris</b> branches into: A. circumflexa femoris lateralis, A. circumflexa femoris medialis and Aa. perforantes. In domestic animals, mammals, the branches of the femoral artery (A. femoralis) are: A. circumflexa femoris lateralis, A. saphena, A. genus descendens and Aa. caudales femoris In the Small Green Monkey, humans and domestic mammals A. femoralis branches into A. genus descendens. The femoral artery of both Small Green Monkey and humans branches into A. <b>profunda</b> <b>femoris.</b> In the Small Green Monkey and domestic mammala, A. femoralis branches into A. saphena and A. caudalis femoris, that is Aa. caudales femoris in domestic mammals, while in humans it branches into A. epigastrica superficialis, A. circumflexa ilium superficialis and Aa. pudendae externae. The branches of A. <b>profunda</b> <b>femoris</b> in the Small Green Monkey and humans are: A. circumflexa femoris lateralis, A. circumflexa femoris medialis, in the Small Green Monkey also Ramus muscularis, and in humans Aa. Perforantes, too. In domestic mammals A. circumflexa femoris lateralis is a branch of A. femoralis. Based on the results of our studying of the Small Green Monkey femoral artery (A. femoralis), we have concluded that some blood vessels branch from A. femoralis {{in the same way as}} in humans, and some as in domestic animals - mammals...|$|R

An immunofluorescence protocol was developed in order {{to assess the impact of}} collateral enlargement (arteriogenesis) on smooth muscle phenotype at various time points. Smooth muscle α-actin was used to mark all smooth muscle cells, Ki- 67 was used to label proliferating smooth muscle cells, and a fluorescent nuclear stain was used to quantify the number of cells present. Samples of the <b>profunda</b> <b>femoris</b> and gracilis were dissected from each mouse hind limb (one ligated, one sham) at three different time points: 3 days, 7 days, and 14 days after a femoral artery ligation surgery. Smooth muscle cell phenotype and luminal cross-sectional area were assessed in the <b>profunda</b> <b>femoris</b> and the midzone of the gracilis collaterals. Smooth muscle cells were proliferating at 3 and 7 days following the occlusion in the gracilis collaterals and significant collateral vessel growth was observed over the two week period. No proliferation was observed in the <b>profunda</b> <b>femoris</b> and although there was an increasing trend in vessel size over the two week period, the averages were not significantly different. The phenotypic transition of the smooth muscle cells was not the cause of vascular impairment in the collateral circuit.
