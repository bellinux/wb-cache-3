25|$|After two wins {{from the}} opening seven matches, Curtis signed Leicester City forward Peter McKennan for £8,000, though he failed to have an {{immediate}} effect on the team's goalscoring problems. Brentford were able to stay afloat in mid-table due to the low number of goals conceded. The Essential Work Order made it almost impossible for the Bees to sign any player aged under 30, due to the club having spent £28,300 (almost double the club's net income) on six new players during the <b>previous</b> <b>financial</b> <b>year,</b> with only Jack Chisholm and Fred Monk aged under 30. Amidst a dire run of form in league matches {{around the turn of}} the year, Peter McKennan finally came into form and scored 9 goals in a seven-match spell, firing Brentford into the sixth round of the FA Cup for the second time in four seasons. In the midst of the run was Brentford's biggest win of the season (8–2 versus Bury on 19 February 1949), in which McKennan became the third (and as of the end of the 2015–16 season) most recent Bees player to score five goals in a Football League match. The Bury fixture also marked the first match in charge for player/manager Jackie Gibbons, having replaced Harry Curtis, who would remain with the club until the end of the season as an advisor to Gibbons. Brentford's FA Cup run ended with defeat to Leicester City in the sixth round, with the 38,678 crowd setting a new Griffin Park record which still stands as of May 2016.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} {{is to examine the}} {{formation}} of a separate risk management committee (RMC) and its effect on the modified audit report among the non-banking and financial companies listed in Bursa Malaysia. Data was collected from the annual reports of a sample of 300 companies from 2004 until 2009. Both descriptive and multivariate analyses were employed to address the research objectives. The results indicate that a separate RMC is negatively related with the acceptance of the modified audit report. Further, the RMC’s members with independent non-executive status and members with accounting and financial background will also probably reduce the acceptance of the modified audit report. However, losses recorded for <b>previous</b> <b>financial</b> <b>years</b> are likely to increase the issuance of modified audit report by the auditor. The period of auditor engagement with the client and client size will also affect the modified audit report. The findings provide empirical evidence on the development and importance of a separate RMC for the modified audit report...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} earnings management to achieve earnings benchmarks. Earnings management is examined {{in terms of}} both accrual-based earnings management and real earnings management, the latter of which, is further decomposed into separate investigation of sales manipulation and overproduction. This study particularly focuses on earnings management associated with the following three earnings benchmarks: meeting analysts' earnings expectations, reporting positive profits and improving <b>previous</b> <b>year's</b> <b>financial</b> performance. This study is quantitative in nature. The sample of the study consists of companies listed in the Helsinki Stock Exchange during the research period of 8 years between 2005 and 2012. The sample is first categorized into two sub-samples based on distributions of sample companies' reported earnings around earnings benchmarks. Further, OLS regression based estimation models are applied to assess the levels of earnings management within the sub-samples. 		 The results {{of this study indicate that}} management's desire to achieve earnings benchmarks acts as an incentive for earnings management in the Finnish context. In particular, the study results suggest that Finnish companies engage in accrual-based earnings management to reach analysts' earnings expectations, and exercise overproduction to improve <b>previous</b> <b>year's</b> <b>financial</b> performance. Regarding the benchmark of reporting positive profits, however, this study does not find proof of any type of earnings management to reach this benchmark...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{investigate}} {{the relation between}} BrandAsset ™ Valuatorand financial performance measures. More specifically, {{we investigate}} whether pillars of the BrandAssetTM Valuatormodel (Brand Vitality and Brand Stature) are associated with accounting performance (return on investment, return on sales and sales over total assets). Brands are generally considered {{a large part of}} the intangible assets of companies, yet the economic consequences of brand management are often difficult to establish. Three questions are addressed: (1) Compared to financial data, do the BrandAssetTM Valuatorpillars provide relative or incremental value? (2) Are BrandAssetTM Valuatorpillars leading indicators of accounting performance? And (3) Are there nonlinear relations between BrandAssetTM Valuatorpillars and financial performance? Our results indicate that Brand Vitality (one of the pillars of Brand Asset Valuator©) is positively and significantly associated with financial performance, while Brand Stature does not appear to have a direct relation with financial performance. Second, Brand Vitality and Brand Stature provide some incremental information in addition to <b>previous</b> <b>year</b> <b>financial</b> performance data; however, the relative information content of Brand Vitality and Brand Stature is lower than <b>previous</b> <b>year</b> <b>financial</b> performance. Third, we find some evidence that the relation between brand value and financial performance is non-linear; high Brand Equity companies display superior financial performance. ...|$|R
