5|$|In {{addition}} to drawbars, many Hammond tonewheel organ models also include <b>presets,</b> which make predefined drawbar combinations {{available at the}} press of a button. Console organs have one octave of reverse colored keys (naturals are black, sharps and flats are white) {{to the left of}} each manual, with each key activating a preset; the far left key (C), also known as the cancel key, de-activates all <b>presets,</b> and results in no sound coming from that manual. The two right-most preset keys (B and B) activate the corresponding set of drawbars for that manual, while the other preset keys produce preselected drawbar settings that are internally wired into the preset panel.|$|E

5|$|Although the duo {{felt that}} the <b>presets</b> and {{parameters}} of digital tools would inhibit creativity and innovation, they admitted that Random Access Memories {{could not have been}} made in the complete absence of computer technology. The sessions were recorded simultaneously onto Ampex reels and as Pro Tools tracks; Daft Punk and Guzauski would then listen to each recording in both analogue and digital iterations, deciding which of the two they preferred. Subsequently, the elements were edited by the duo with Pro Tools in a manner similar to how they would work with samples.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{relation}} between synchronizing sequences and <b>preset</b> distinguishing sequences which are some special sequences used in finite state machine based testing. We show that the problems related to <b>preset</b> distinguishing sequences can be converted into related problems of synchronizing sequences. Using the results existing in the literature for synchronizing sequences, we offer several reflections of these results for <b>preset</b> distinguishing sequences. Although computing a <b>preset</b> distinguishing sequence is PSPACE-hard, we do identify a class of machines for which computing a <b>preset</b> distinguishing sequence can be performed in polynomial time and argue that this class is practically relevant. We also present an experimental study to compare the performance of exponential brute-force and polynomial heuristic algorithms to compute a <b>preset</b> distinguishing sequence...|$|R
5|$|After {{performing}} at Wave Aid, Silverchair reunited and by late 2005 began preparations {{for their next}} studio album, Young Modern. Johns had written about 50 songs during the hiatus for a possible solo album or other project but decided to use them for Silverchair. In 2006, after five weeks practice the group demoed tracks in the Hunter Region, and then recorded at Los Angeles' Seedy Underbelly Studios with Launay as producer. Parks again arranged orchestral tracks for the band – they travelled to Prague to record with the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra. The group also used Mac, Luke Steele (The Sleepy Jackson) and Julian Hamilton (The <b>Presets,</b> The Dissociatives) – Hamilton also co-wrote songs with Johns. Silverchair self-funded the album's production to ease the pressures faced previously when working with a record label.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{instrument}} had been originally {{designed for use}} in a church, Hammond realized that the amateur home market was a far more lucrative business, and started manufacturing spinet organs in the late 1940s. Outside of the United States, they were manufactured in greater numbers than the consoles, and hence were more widely used. Several different types of M series instruments were produced between 1948 and 1964; they contained two 44-note manuals with one set of drawbars each, and a 12-note pedalboard. The M model was produced from 1948 to 1951, the M-2 from 1951 to 1955, and the M-3 from 1955 to 1964. The M series was replaced by the M-100 series in 1961, which used a numbering system to identify the body style and finish as used on earlier console series. It included the same manuals as the M, but increased the pedalboard size to 13 notes, stretching a full octave, and included a number of <b>presets.</b>|$|E

25|$|As {{technology}} {{continues to}} advance, {{more can be}} added onto the controller to give the player a more immersive experience when playing different games. There are some controllers that have <b>presets</b> so that the buttons are mapped a certain way to make playing certain games easier.

On keyboard and mouse, different actions in the game are already preset to keys on the keyboard.

40|$|Abstract: This papers designs the {{identification}} method of transmitter recognition in wireless networks {{by analyzing the}} wireless networks and the physical frame structure of China Mobile Multimedia Broadcasting(CMMB) system. The method calculates the time from the signal of <b>preset</b> transmitter to the measurement site according to the <b>preset</b> transmitter location information, the measured identification signal information of transmitter and the location information of meas-urement location. And then compare {{the time that the}} <b>preset</b> transmitter signal reaches the measurement site and that of the measured transmitter signal reaches the measurement site. Finally, it judges the <b>preset</b> transmitter identification corre-sponding to the concrete measured transmitter identification. The method can accurately recognize every transmitter when there are many transmitters with same autocorrelation value in the <b>preset</b> transmitter recognition, which is benefit for the optimizing of CMMB wireless networks...|$|R
50|$|<b>Preset</b> {{boards are}} not as {{prevalent}} {{since the advent of}} digital memory consoles, which can store scenes digitally, and are generally much less cumbersome but more expensive than <b>preset</b> boards. However, for small setups such as that of a DJ, they remain the board of choice for their simple to use interface and relative flexibility. <b>Preset</b> boards generally control only conventional lights; though some advanced hybrid consoles can be patched to operate intelligent lights in a round-about way by setting the control channels of the light to channels the <b>preset</b> board can control. This is however not recommended since it is a long, drawn-out, and cumbersome process.|$|R

40|$|Work done in {{the past}} on the subject of state-identification in finite automata has been limited to devising {{procedures}} for some special-purpose identification experiments, and to estimating the lengths of more general experiments. The purpose of the present paper is to complement this work by presenting procedures for solving general state-identification problems by experiments of various specified characteristics. Classifying identification experiments into <b>preset</b> or adaptive and into simple or multiple, the results contain procedures for identifying the initial state of an automaton by minimal, simple, <b>preset</b> or adaptive experiments, whenever simple, <b>preset</b> experimentation is realizable, and by multiple, <b>preset</b> or adaptive experiments, whenever simple experimentation is not realizable. Also, procedures are described for identifying the final state of an automaton by minimal or nonminimal, <b>preset</b> or adaptive experiments. Bounds associated with the various procedures are determined, and the applicability of the results to machine-identification problems is discussed...|$|R
