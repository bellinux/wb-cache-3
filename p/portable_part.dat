The data suggests that BIA works well in healthy subjects and in patients with stable water and electrolytes balance with a validated BIA equation that is appropriate with regard to age, sex and race. Clinical use of BIA in subjects at extremes of BMI ranges or with abnormal hydration cannot be recommended for routine assessment of patients until further validation has proven for BIA algorithm to be accurate in such conditions. Multi-frequency- and segmental-BIA may have advantages over single-frequency BIA in these conditions, but further validation is necessary. Longitudinal follow-up of body composition by BIA is possible in subjects with BMI 16 – 34 kg/m 2 without abnormal hydration, but must be interpreted with caution. Further validation of BIA is necessary to understand the mechanisms for the changes observed in acute illness, altered fat/lean mass ratios, extreme heights and body shape abnormalities...|$|E

GAP also mandates procedures for registering <b>Portable</b> <b>Parts</b> to a Fixed Part (Mobility Management). A GAP-compliant handset from one manufacturer should work, at the basic level of making calls, with a GAP-compliant base from another manufacturer, although it may be unable to access advanced features of the base station such as phone book synchronization or remote operation of an answering machine. Most consumer-level DECT phones and base stations support the GAP profile, even those that do not publicize the feature, and thus can be used together. However some manufacturers lock their systems to prevent interoperability, or supply bases that cannot register new handsets.|$|R

Using new large-scale, integrated employer-employee data containing information on 68 million individuals and 3. 6 million firms, we explain a very large proportion (84 %) of the total variation in wages rates and attribute substantial variation to both individual and employer heterogeneity. While the wage distribution remained largely unchanged between 1992 - 1997, we document a pronounced right shift in the overall distribution of human capital. Most workers entering our sample, while less experienced, were otherwise more highly skilled, a difference which can be attributed almost exclusively to unobservables. Nevertheless, compared to exiters and continuers, entrants exhibited a greater tendency to match to firms paying below average internal wages. Firms reduced employment shares of low skilled workers and increased employment shares of high skilled workers in virtually every industry. Our results strongly suggest that the distribution of human capital will continue to shift to the right, implying a continuing up-skilling of the employed labor force. human capital, employer-employee data...|$|E
40|$|The International Society of Automation (ISA) {{released}} ISA- 100. 11 a on September 9, 2010. ISA- 100. 11 a {{is an open}} wireless industrial {{sensor network}} standard based on the IEEE 802. 15. 4 low-rate wireless personal area network PHY and MAC specifications, and is aimed at process control and related automation. There are few available ISA- 100. 11 a products, and only one compliant software protocol stack exists. This work is done to try and change this, by starting the implementation of an open-source ISA- 100. 11 a protocol stack, {{as well as a}} hardware device. This thesis builds on the authors&# 146; own prestudy, where the ISA- 100. 11 a standard document was explored and a more accessible overview over the standard created, and a hardware platform was evaluated as a possible candidate for the implementation but fell through. This thesis evaluates another hardware platform; the ATmega 128 RFA 1 combined microcontroller/IEEE 802. 15. 4 transceiver from Atmel, and finds it up for the job. The implementation of an ISA- 100. 11 a protocol stack is started. The software is split in two parts: - A 100 % <b>portable</b> <b>part</b> containing most of the ISA- 100. 11 a-defined functionality, intended for use {{on a wide range of}} platforms. This portable protocol stack module is implemented to a level where quite a bit of the ISA- 100. 11 a specified functionality can be demonstrated. - A platform specific part, which acts as a driver layer between the portable protocol stack module and the underlying hardware/software platform. A preliminary version of the platform specific part for the ATmega 128 RFA 1 device is implemented, which can be used together with the portable protocol stack module. This thesis describes the development strategy and process, describes the structure, interfaces and mechanisms of the implemented parts, and demonstrates the product. Finally, the product is concluded to be a good start on the process of creating an open-source implementation of the protocol stack. A journal article linked with the open-source release of the source code is planned. </p...|$|E
40|$|New York ranks {{eight out}} of the 50 states in terms of carbon emissions. While the State {{government}} {{is just beginning to}} enact meaningful programs and incentives to encourage municipal policies and actions that will reduce the impact of local decisions on our carbon footprint, a number of local governments across the State have already been at work developing and adopting 2 ̆ 2 greening 2 ̆ 2 strategies, policies and regulations. While the New York State Bar Association has released for comment a report of its Task Force on Global Warming which documents an impressive two-dozen current state-level laws and programs on climate change, the fact remains that there has been little public sector benchmarking to determine whether the quantity of programs is yielding quantifiable results to ensure that investments are being made wisely. Further, {{there is a lack of}} overall state-level coordination among the dozens of programs and resulting initiatives leading to confusion, potential diffusion of state resources, less than perfect communication within and between the executive and legislative branches of government, and missed opportunities. While meaningful State-level programs are vital to achieving emissions reductions goals, a state cannot be successful without collaboration and partnerships with its local governments. Fortunately, many New York cities, towns and villages have also been at work trying to develop and implement strategies to curb emissions. Municipalities are choosing to adopt clear statements and action items in their comprehensive land use plans; they are creating climate change or sustainability task forces and developing strategies; and they are enacting regulations to promote green building and alternative energy development. Unfortunately, while somewhat anecdotally it appears that roughly one hundred local governments have adopted serious climate change and energy efficiency initiatives, this number is dwarfed by the realization that New York is home to approximately 1, 600 units of local government. New York must do more to recognize the importance of local action through a combination of incentives and technical assistance that includes access to reliable data and other related information. This article is not intended to critique all of the state-level programs and initiatives in New York. Rather it seeks to demonstrate that while there is a substantial level of activity in New York with respect to climate change and energy efficiency issues, the true potential of these programs will not be fully realized because New York lacks a coordinated, comprehensive and fully integrated inter-jurisdictional approach to addressing these challenges. Although New York is selected as the focus of study, similar observations may be made in jurisdictions throughout the country, and the recommendations are equally <b>portable.</b> <b>Part</b> II focuses on local governments as the laboratories of innovation, highlighting a number of creative and ambitious programs adopted and tools and techniques employed to address climate change issues at the municipal level. This part contains a brief mention of federal and state preemption issues, as a reminder that all levels of government must be working together with the same goals in mind. Part III offers recommendations as to what the State can do to encourage more activity at the municipal level where change in behavior and regulatory reform has great potential to quickly reduce the carbon footprint in communities across the State...|$|E
