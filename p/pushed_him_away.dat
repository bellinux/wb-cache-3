25|$|At {{the same}} time as the final {{pamphlet}} of the series, May 1642, Milton married Marie Powell (see John Milton's relationships). The marriage was short-lived, as the First English Civil War broke out, for reasons not fully explained, but set off Milton's divorce tracts, another polemical series of pamphlets beginning in 1643. Milton's advocacy of divorce <b>pushed</b> <b>him</b> <b>away</b> from Puritan orthodoxy, and led on to Areopagitica of 1644 against censorship, his most lasting prose work.|$|E
25|$|Pseudo-Apollodorus records an archaic legend, {{which claims}} that Hephaestus once {{attempted}} to rape Athena, but she <b>pushed</b> <b>him</b> <b>away,</b> {{causing him to}} ejaculate on her thigh. Athena wiped the semen off using a tuft of wool, which she tossed into the dust, impregnating Gaia and causing her {{to give birth to}} Erichthonius, whom Athena adopted as her own child. The Roman mythographer Hyginus records a similar story in which Hephaestus demanded Zeus to let him marry Athena since {{he was the one who}} had smashed open Zeus's skull, allowing Athena to be born. Zeus agreed to this and Hephaestus and Athena were married, but, when Hephaestus was about to consummate the union, Athena vanished from the bridal bed, causing him to ejaculate on the floor, thus impregnating Gaia with Erichthonius.|$|E

500|$|During {{the flight}} back to England, Lennon got very drunk on Scotch and confessed {{that he had been}} {{involved}} with other women during their marriage. He went on to detail his liaisons with groupies, friends (such as Joan Baez, actress Eleanor Bron, journalist Cleave) and [...] "thousands" [...] of women around the globe. Although not wanting to hear Lennon's confession, she knew women were attracted to him, [...] "like moths to a flame". Two weeks later, in May 1968, Lennon suggested Cynthia take a holiday in Greece with Mardas, Donovan, and two friends, as he would be very busy recording songs for what would become The White Album. She arrived back at Kenwood from Greece earlier than expected, at 4 o'clock on 22 May 1968, to discover Lennon and Ono sitting cross-legged on the floor in matching white robes, staring into each other's eyes, and then found Ono's slippers outside the Lennons' bedroom door. Shocked, she asked Jenny Boyd and Mardas if she could spend the night at their apartment. At the apartment Boyd went straight to bed, but she and Mardas drank more alcohol, with Mardas trying to convince her to run away together. After she had vomited in the bathroom, she collapsed on a bed in the spare bedroom, with Mardas joining her and trying to kiss her until she <b>pushed</b> <b>him</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E

After becoming emperor, Cao Pi summoned Su Ze to the imperial capital, Luoyang, {{to serve as a}} Palace Attendant (侍中). He also assigned Su Ze to the same office as Dong Zhao. On one occasion, while taking a break, Dong Zhao laid {{down on the floor and}} rested his head on Su Ze's lap. Su Ze <b>pushed</b> <b>him</b> <b>away</b> and said, [...] "My lap is not a pillow for sycophants." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{started a}} {{relationship}} with Jim Witowski (aka 'Johnny Cakes'), a short-order cook {{who worked at the}} restaurant where Vito regularly stopped for breakfast. Vito was impressed when he found out Jim was a volunteer fireman. When Jim first tried to kiss him, Vito <b>pushed</b> <b>him</b> <b>away,</b> called him a fag, and the two scuffled briefly. Several days later, Vito went back to the restaurant and apologized, saying, [...] "Sometimes you tell a lie so long, you don't know when to stop." [...] The two men reconciled. They drove on their motorcycles to a secluded spot by a nearby lake, where they picnicked and had sex. Vito moved in with Jim shortly thereafter.|$|E

2500|$|A non-Jew asked Shammai {{to convert}} him to Judaism on {{condition}} that Shammai appoint him High Priest. Shammai <b>pushed</b> <b>him</b> <b>away</b> with a builder's ruler. The non-Jew then went to Hillel, who converted him. The convert then read Torah, {{and when he came}} to the injunction of [...] , and [...] that [...] "the common man who draws near shall be put to death," [...] he asked Hillel to whom the injunction applied. Hillel answered that it applied even to David, King of Israel, who had not been a priest. Thereupon the convert reasoned a fortiori that if the injunction applied to all (non-priestly) Israelites, whom in [...] God had called [...] "my firstborn," [...] how much more so would the injunction apply to a mere convert, who came among the Israelites with just his staff and bag. Then the convert returned to Shammai, quoted the injunction, and remarked on how absurd it had been for him to ask Shammai to appoint him High Priest.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the end of}} 1904, KR became {{somewhat}} {{attached to}} an attractive young {{man by the name}} of Yatsko. [...] "I sent for Yatsko and he came this morning. I easily persuaded him to be candid. It was strange for me to hear him describe the familiar characteristics: he has never felt drawn to a woman, and has been infatuated with men several times. I did not confess to him that I knew these feelings from my own personal experience. Yatsko and I talked for a long time. Before leaving he kissed my face and hands; I should not have allowed this, and should have <b>pushed</b> <b>him</b> <b>away,</b> however I was punished afterwards by vague feelings of shame and remorse. He told me that, ever since the first time we met, his soul has been filled with rapturous feelings towards me, which grow all the time. How this reminds me of my own youth." [...] A few days later, KR and Yatsko met again, and a relationship developed between the two.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{great success}} on the field, Cobb was no {{stranger}} to controversy off it. As described in Smithsonian Magazine, [...] "In 1907 during spring training in Augusta, Georgia, a black groundskeeper named Bungy Cummings, whom Cobb had known for years, attempted to shake Cobb's hand or pat him on the shoulder." [...] The [...] "overly familiar greeting infuriated" [...] Cobb, who attacked Cummings. When Cummings' wife tried to defend him, Cobb allegedly choked her. The assault was only stopped when catcher Charles [...] "Boss" [...] Schmidt knocked Cobb out. However, aside from Schmidt's statement to the press, no other corroborating witnesses to the assault on Cummings ever came forward and Cummings himself never made a public comment about it. Author Charles Leerhsen speculates that the assault on Cummings and his wife never occurred and that Schmidt likely made it up completely. Cobb had spent the previous year defending himself on several occasions from assaults by Schmidt, with Schmidt often coming out of nowhere to blindside Cobb. On that day, several reporters did see Cummings, who appeared to be [...] "partially under the influence of liquor", approach Cobb and shout [...] "Hello, Carrie!" [...] (the meaning of which is unknown) and go in for a hug. Cobb then <b>pushed</b> <b>him</b> <b>away,</b> which was the last interaction that anyone saw between Cobb and Cummings. Shortly thereafter, hearing a fight, several reporters came running and found Cobb and Schmidt wrestling on the ground. When the fight was broken up and Cobb had walked away, Schmidt remained behind and told the reporters that he saw Cobb assaulting Cummings and his wife and had intervened. Leerhsen speculates that this was just another one of Schmidt's assaults on Cobb and that once discovered, Schmidt made up a story that made him sound like he had assaulted Cobb for a noble purpose. In 1908, Cobb attacked a black laborer in Detroit who complained when Cobb stepped into freshly poured asphalt; Cobb was found guilty of battery but the sentence was suspended.|$|E
