To overcome the endogeneity of the emigration decision, I employ an instrumental variables approach that relies on the deep historical roots and high <b>persistence</b> <b>characteristic</b> of Mexican migration. My results show that emigration had a significant negative effect across all price index product classifications.

40|$|A space-time {{statistical}} analysis of total outgoing infrared radiation is {{used to determine the}} gross features of day-to-day cloudiness fluctuations over the Pacific Ocean in summer and winter.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Authors have {{reported}} increased incidence of multiresistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MR-PA) infections worldwide {{over the last}} decade. Researchers have proposed multifaceted approaches to control MR-PA infections, but none {{have been reported in}} the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) setting. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: Herein we report the impact of a multifaceted intervention for controlling MR-PA over five years in a hospital with AIDS-predominant admissions and describe the clinical characteristics of MR-PA infection in our patient population. The clinical outcomes of infected patients and molecular characteristics of the isolated strains were used as tools for controlling MR-PA infection rates. RESULTS: Significant temporary decrease of new infections was achieved after intervention, although a high level of diagnostic suspicion of nosocomial infection was maintained. We obtained 35 P. aeruginosa isolates with multiresistant profiles from 13 infected and 3 colonized patients and 2 environmental samples. Most of the patients (94 %) were immunocompromised with AIDS (n = 10) or HTLV- 1 infections (n = 5). Of the followed patients, 67 % had persistent and/or recurrent infections, and 92 % died. We observed differences in the antibiotic-resistance pattern of MR-PA infection/colonization during two outbreaks, although the genetic profiles of the tested strains were identical. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, we concluded that early multidisciplinary interventions are essential for reducing the burden caused by this microorganism in patients with AIDS.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, the {{influence}} of maneuver design for stability derivatives of aerodynamic forces and moments identification {{in the performance of}} closed loop control systems is evaluated, where two maneuvers largely used in aeronautical industry - doublet and 3211 - are compared to a maneuver of restricted use in aeronautical industry, but already well known in identification - the PRBS. This evaluation is divided in two steps: in the first, it is performed the identification with each of the maneuvers and then a crosschecking of the obtained models, computing the mean quadratic prediction error; in the second, the identified models are analytically linearized and use in a bank angle tracker. The calculated gains are then applied to the nonlinear model and the performance indices computed, as peak time and maximum overshoot, of step response with each gain set. The crosschecking showed the superior capacity of PRBS maneuver to capture the dynamics of the reference model, where the prediction error was relatively small for all models when compared to the response to doublet. With the 3211 data set, the error of the model identified with doublet was significantly larger than 3211 and PRBS models error, that had similar performance, however lightly better for the PRBS. With the PRBS data set, the PRBS error was relatively small, while the doublet and 3211 models error was relatively large. This result shows the direct relation of the maneuvers frequency spectra and the excitation <b>persistence</b> <b>characteristic</b> in the identified models. With an exigent performance requirement to the bank angle tracker, it was possible to expose the differences between the models and verify {{the influence of}} these differences in the closed loop response. In an equivalent form, as observed in the crosschecking analysis, the control system designed with the PRBS model showed performance indices closer to the target in comparison to the control system designed with the 3211 model, that was significatively better than the system designed with the doublet model. The closed loop amplified the difference between the models, and depending on the control system structure, these differences can be still larger. Finally, a practical application on aircraft identification and control is presented and discussed...|$|E
40|$|To {{examine the}} effects of climate {{variability}} on streamflow, this thesis presents a comprehensive analysis of the streamflow variability of the continental United States and its association with oceanic-atmospheric indices. First, the presence of trends with consideration of short term and long term persistence followed by shifts over the past years in the continental U. S. streamflow were analyzed by using the non-parametric tests: Mann Kendall and Pettitt. Second, the spatio-temporal relationships between seasonal streamflow variability of continental U. S. and sea surface temperatures (SST) and 500 mbar geopotential height (Z 500) of the Pacific and Atlantic were established using the singular valued decomposition (SVD) factorization technique. Finally, the SVD technique was used to determine the spatio-temporal relationships between western U. S. seasonal streamflow variability and indicators (SST and Z 500) of Pacific Ocean variability. The results indicated that significant trends and shifts existed in the streamflow volumes {{in the past few decades}} in the continental U. S., and short term and long term persistence was evident in streamflows. Removal of the <b>persistence</b> <b>characteristic</b> removed the spurious trends, that could otherwise be misinterpreted. The 19702 ̆ 7 s were the years when major shifts took place, and most of the shift periods coincided with the phase changes of multi-decadal oscillations. A strong spatio-temporal relationship of the streamflow was established with the oceanic-atmospheric indicators and the multi-decadal oscillations (PDO, AMO) did influence these relationships. Seasonal analysis showed an improved explanation of co-variability over water-year. The lead-time approach showed that the relationships could be explained up to 9 months ahead and Z 500 showed improved results over SST at shorter lead-times. Several new regions apart from the well identified index regions were identified in the oceanic region to have strong relationships with seasonal streamflows. The individual basins showed unique relationships with the indicators both spatially and temporally which could be due to their unique topographical and local factors. The contributions from this research include a better understanding of the changes in continental U. S. streamflow and the spatio-temporal relationships with oceanic-atmospheric variability that can help in better water management decisions...|$|E

40|$|The {{rational}} expectations hypothesis for survey and model-based inflation forecasts − from the Survey of Professional Forecasters and the Greenbook respectively − is examined by properly {{taking into account}} the <b>persistence</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the data. The finding of near-unit-root effects in the inflation and inflation expectations series motivates the use of a local-to-unity specification of the inflation process that enables us to test whether the data are generated by locally non-stationary or stationary processes. Thus, we test, rather than assume, stationarity of near-unit-root processes. In addition, we set out an empirical framework for assessing relationships between locally non-stationary series. In this context, we test the {{rational expectations}} hypothesis by allowing the co-existence of a long-run relationship obtained under the rational expectations restrictions with short-run "learning" effects. Our empirical results indicate that the rational expectations hypothesis holds in the long run, while forecasters adjust their expectations slowly in the short run. This finding lends support to the hypothesis that the persistence of inflation comes from the dynamics of expectations. ...|$|R

Continuous update systems that allow updating data by multiple writers have harder problems to overcome since the ordering of updates needs to be maintained independently of connectivity conditions.

After a persistence of random duration (averaging 8. 4 days), the composite anomaly's decay is accompanied by simultaneous retrogression of the pattern from western North America to eastern Asia and eastward progression of the pattern over Europe and western Asia. Substantial disruption of the Pacific storm track and enhancement of the Atlantic storm track accompanies the life cycle of this flow regime.

It is found that a persistence barrier exists around October and November. This fall persistence barrier (FPB) is well recognized in the devel-oping phase of strong ENSO cases, but becomes vague in weak ENSO and normal (non-ENSO) cases. During a strong El Niño developing year, salient features of the SCS SST anomaly (SSTA) associated with the FPB include a sign reversal between summer and winter and a rapid warming during fall. One possible cause of these SST changes, {{as well as the}} occurrence of the FPB, is the development and evolution of a low-level anomalous anticyclone (LAAC). The analyses show that the LAAC emerges in the northern Indian Ocean in early northern fall, moves eastward into the SCS during fall, and eventually anchors in the Philippine Sea in northern winter. This provides a new scenario for the generation of the anomalous Philippine Sea anticyclone previously studied. Its eastward movement appears to result from an east–west asymmetry, relative to the anticyclonic circulation center, of divergent flow and associated atmospheric vertical motion/moisture fields. The eastward passage of the LAAC across the SCS warms the underlying SST first via increased absorption of solar heating in October as it suppresses convective activities in situ...|$|R

The obtained data were correlated to genomic diversity of the strains using comparative genome hybridization (CGH) datasets, but this approach failed to discover specific genetic loci that explain the observed differences between the strains. Moreover, we developed a next-generation sequencing-based method that targets a variable intergenic region, and employed this method to assess the in vivo GI-tract persistence of different L. plantarum strains when administered in mixtures to healthy human volunteers. Remarkable consistency of the strain-specific persistence curves were observed between individual volunteers, which also correlated significantly with the GI-tract survival predicted on basis of the in vitro assay. Conclusion: The survival of individual L. plantarum strains in the GI-tract could not be correlated to the absence or presence of specific genes compared to the reference strain L. plantarum WCFS 1. Nevertheless, in vivo persistence analysis in th...|$|R
40|$|As a key {{variable}} of the land-climate system soil moisture is a main driver of runoff and evapotranspiration under certain conditions. Soil moisture furthermore exhibits outstanding memory (<b>persistence)</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Also for runoff many studies report distinct low frequency variations that represent a memory. Using data from over 100 near-natural catchments located across Europe we investigate {{in this study}} the connection between soil moisture memory and the respective memory of runoff and evapotranspiration on different time scales. For this purpose we use a simple water balance model in which dependencies of runoff (normalized by precipitation) and evapotranspiration (normalized by radiation) on soil moisture are fitted using runoff observations. The model therefore allows to compute memory of soil moisture, runoff and evapotranspiration on catchment scale. We find considerable memory in soil moisture and runoff {{in many parts of}} the continent, and evapotranspiration also displays some memory on a monthly time scale in some catchments. We show that the memory of runoff and evapotranspiration jointly depend on soil moisture memory and on the strength of the coupling of runoff and evapotranspiration to soil moisture. Furthermore we find that the coupling strengths of runoff and evapotranspiration to soil moisture depend on the shape of the fitted dependencies and on the variance of the meteorological forcing. To better interpret the magnitude of the respective memories across Europe we finally provide a new perspective on hydrological memory by relating it to the mean duration required to recover from anomalies exceeding a certain threshold...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the accrual anomaly first {{documented}} by Sloan (1996), i. e. {{the finding that the}} stock market prices appear to overweigh the role of accruals persistence and under-weigh the role of operating cash flow persistence. In an analysis based on Danish financial statement data it is demonstrated that different specific components of earnings have significantly different earnings <b>persistence</b> <b>characteristics</b> and that these differences are not fully reflected in share prices. In the analysis presented here the earnings persistence effect of two particular unexpected accrual components are specifically analyzed, namely the unexpected inventory accrual component and the unexpected accounts receivable accrual component, i. e. changes in accruals not motivated by corresponding changes in company activity-level. Additionally and for comparison, the accounting accruals are split into expected and unexpected accruals, estimated by the extended Jones model like in both some US-analyses and some international studies of the accrual anomaly phenomenon. It is found that the persistence of earnings is decreasing in the magnitude of the unexpected accrual components of earnings and that the persistence of current earnings performance is particularly decreasing in the magnitude of unexpected changes in inventory. The special accrual parts are related to the perceptions of earnings persistence implicit in the market prices, and it is found that the differences in earnings persistence are not rationally reflected by share price differencesDiscretionary accruals; Earnings management; Earnings Persistence; Accrual anomaly;...|$|R
