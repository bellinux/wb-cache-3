Statements that are not falsifiable cannot be examined by scientific investigation since they <b>permit</b> <b>no</b> tests that evaluate their accuracy. Creationists such as Henry M. Morris have claimed that any observation can be fitted into the evolutionary framework, so it is impossible to demonstrate that evolution is wrong and therefore evolution is non-scientific.|$|E
25|$|Two main washes – Moenkopi Wash and Dinnebito Wash - {{pass through}} the mine permit area and {{eventually}} run into the Little Colorado River. Although mining does not occur in these washes, storm water runoff from areas disturbed by mining activities could potentially degrade the quality of water going into them. To prevent degradation of surface waters, sedimentation ponds are constructed under the mine’s surface water protection program. Water quality is monitored and controlled at these ponds, {{as well as at}} livestock watering ponds, seeps and storm water runoff. The program is regulated through the US EPA’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System under NPDES <b>permit</b> <b>No.</b> NN0022179, and Multi-Sector General <b>Permit</b> <b>No.</b> AZR05000I.|$|E

500|$|The first city {{ordinances}} banning all motorized vehicles {{from the}} island were passed on July 6, 1898, with similar state park rules coming in 1901. The residents complained after a doctor's car scared their horses and caused carriage accidents, and these complaints prompted the ban. As such, other {{than a handful of}} emergency and utility vehicles as well as others by special, limited-time <b>permit,</b> <b>no</b> cars or trucks are allowed on the island and no motorized vehicles appear on M-185. Traffic on this highway is by foot, on horse, by horse-drawn vehicle, or by bicycle; M-185 is the only such state highway in the country [...] "that allows no automobiles". As a result, the roadside litter is picked up using a horse-drawn wagon.|$|E

500|$|The breed {{retained}} its mountain roots with its main stud, the National Provincial Stud, being {{located in the}} mountain country of Langonnet. It was {{at this time that}} Arabian and Thoroughbred blood was added to the breed, creating the Corlay subtype. From the Middle Ages until the early 1900s, the Breton was crossed with various horses, both native and foreign, including the Boulonnais, Percheron and Ardennes breeds. [...] In the 19th century it was crossbred with the Norfolk Trotter, which resulted in a lighter weight type of Breton, the Postier subtype. Today, the Breton breed is controlled by the Syndicat des Éleveurs de Cheval Breton, an organization dating its studbook to 1909 when it was created, with separate books for the Heavy Draft and Postier types. In 1912, the books were combined but separate sections were used for each type, and in 1926 the sections were combined so that all types of Bretons are now registered together. Postier Bretons must be of documented Posteir bloodstock and pass in-harness performance tests. In 1920, {{the decision was made to}} <b>permit</b> <b>no</b> new outside blood into the studbook, and in 1951 the studbook was officially closed to outside horses. Breton horses are only eligible to be registered if they were foaled in the present-day region of Brittany or in the Loire-Atlantique department, formerly part of Brittany. [...] Registered foals are branded with a [...] "cross surmounting a splayed, upturned V" [...] on the left side of the neck. [...] Despite the registration restrictions, breeding of the Breton horse has spread across France, and around the world. [...] Today in France, the Breton is bred mainly at studs in Lamballe, Hennebont, and parts of La Roche-sur-Yon.|$|E

[...] Novial permits some 2-vowel combinations to be pronounced either as 2 separate vowels or as diphthongs; for example, au, eu and oi may be pronounced as a + w, e + w and o + y, respectively, and ie, io and ia as y + e, y + o and y + a, respectively.|$|E
2500|$|In 1923, {{there were}} student and alumni protests at Florida A College. Frustrated at the {{dismissal}} of former President Nathan B. Young, the students forwarded a petition to college trustees protesting the appointment of President Howard. The board chose to ignore the students' petition and, anticipating further student protest, instructed Howard's secretary to inform him [...] "to <b>permit</b> <b>no</b> insubordination or ‘striking' among the student body {{even if he had}} to expel the entire student body." [...] The students immediately boycotted classes, and continued their call for Howard's dismissal. Angered at continuing student protests, Howard dismissed eleven students [...] "for the part they played in calling a strike." [...] His action drove student dissatisfaction underground, and in the next five months fire destroyed the women's dormitory and the mechanical arts building, each under mysterious circumstances. Meanwhile, at Fisk, student unrest continued to simmer.|$|E

Although camping and fishing are allowed with proper <b>permit,</b> <b>no</b> roads or buildings are constructed, {{and there is also}} no logging or mining. Hunting is permitted during the appropriate hunting seasons. Hunting and fishing licenses are available from the state of Idaho through the Idaho Department of Fish and Game. There are 40 trails totaling nearly [...] in the wilderness {{that can be used for}} day hiking, backpacking, and horseback riding and accessed from 23 trailheads. Most of these trails were constructed or reconstructed in the 1960s. Mountain climbing, rock climbing, snowshoeing, and backcountry downhill skiing are activities that are also permitted in the wilderness. The closest town to the wilderness is Stanley at the northern end of the Sawtooth Valley, but the communities of Atlanta and Sawtooth City also provide access to the wilderness.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the slave}} ship Banastre, Thomas Smith, master, arrived at Calabar, Captain Patrick Fairweather, of Tarleton, another vessel under the {{ownership}} of the Tarleton-Backhouse partnership, and a senior captain for them, sent Banastre to the coast of Cameroon. When she arrived there some natives in a canoe approached to trade with her, but were warned off by a shot from Othello that killed one of the natives. McGauley had ordered the shot fired because the natives on that coast owed him a debt and he had declared that he would <b>permit</b> <b>no</b> trade until they had paid him. In 1793 the case of Tarleton and others vs. McGauley came to trial with the plaintiffs suing McGauley for loss of trade. The court found for the plaintiffs, establishing {{that it is a}} tort [...] "to cause damage to a person by maliciously using any unlawful means, (e.g. fraud, or threats of assault), to induce anyone to abstain from entering into a contract with him." ...|$|E
2500|$|User {{fees and}} group size {{limitations}} had {{little impact on}} the number of users by mid-1991, and the total number of floaters rose 7.1 percent to 2,842. This forced FWP to implement Stage 4 of its management plan. With the number of requests for recreational floater permits exceeding the available supply, FWP initiated the first [...] "lottery" [...] (random drawing) to award permits on oversubscribed days. The agency also limited the number of commercial launches per day to two, began assigning boat camps to outfitters, and limited the ways in which commercial outfitter permits could be transferred. The agency also decided to <b>permit</b> <b>no</b> more than 20 outfitters to operate on the river. This reflected the public's perception that outfitters generally represented wealthy, out-of-state clients, and FWP (despite strong outfitter opposition) decided to favor the public over outfitters. Severe drought struck Montana in 1992, severely limiting the floating season. FWP took advantage of the low number of users to add electricity and running water to the Camp Baker and Eden Bridge campsites. 1992 also saw FWP establish a [...] "Corridor Enhancement Account" [...] designed to build a fund for protecting and improving the Smith River Corridor.|$|E
