40|$|Numerous exotic {{vertebrates}} are {{imported into}} California {{each year for}} use in scientific research, zoological gardens, the commercial pet trade, and private collections. Certain of these imported species are known within their native range to depredate agricultural commodities, compete with other species of wildlife, and facilitate the spread of. diseases detrimental to humans or other animals. The California Department of Food and Agriculture, in cooperation with other governmental agencies and conservation-oriented societies, is active in the exclusion, detection, and eradication of these detrimental species. Exclusion procedures include inspections of air cargo, truck, and <b>postal</b> <b>terminals</b> in addition to private automobiles. Detection procedures involve surveying urban areas, cropland, entryways, rangeland, and high hazard situations. The results obtained indicate these preventative procedures are both efficient and effective...|$|R
40|$|Massive {{efforts have}} been {{observed}} towards solving terminal location problems in a large variety of approaches. Daskin 1) reports two categories of research approaches: network-location; and location on the space. The first category is subdivided into several sub-themes according to maximization / minimization criteria (demands, distances, time, etc). The second category {{is related to the}} evaluation of operational conditions such as integration aspects and external costs without using network 2). These formulations present some limitations mainly because they do not incorporate real spatial data and only use general simplifications. More specifically, the network approach uses link-node structure just incorporating distances and time factors. This is limited to express real conditions of the network and just considers basic traffic system (roads, streets, avenues, etc). On the other hand, location on the space models evaluate many different criteria (demand, linear distances, population, etc) without a deep and concrete reference to spatial reality compromising the comparison between potential locations for terminals. In this paper, we present a methodology to determine the best location for a <b>postal</b> freight <b>terminal,</b> which intends to contribute to eliminate the gap between network and location on the space approaches. Specifically for a <b>postal</b> freight <b>terminal,</b> it is fundamental to represent the Postal Collection-Distribution System (PCDS) since the displacements executed in this system are narrowly related to the locational costs. We describe a methodology that provides a wide appreciation of the factors influencing the location. Exploring Geographical Information Systems (GIS), different data from various sources are combined and analyzed based upon a progressive evaluation that starts with a hierarchical evaluation using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and concluded by conducting a network optimization. This paper is organized in four sections. After this introduction, in item two the proposed methodology is described. Next, we introduce the case study for the location of a <b>postal</b> freight <b>terminal</b> in Brazil. Finally, the fourth item presents the conclusion...|$|R

5000|$|On Thursday, November 3, 1988, at 04:25, postal trains {{delivered}} {{a lot of}} mail at the postal rail terminal between Copenhagen central station and Copenhagen police headquarters. At 04:50, money and other high-value mail was loaded from the trains to a yellow armored postal van, call sign 8886 K5B, with the driver [...] "JF" [...] and the guard [...] "FA". The van had a direct radio link to police HQ, but the gang thought the radio link was to the postal HQ who would then have to phone the police before the police could respond to any robbery. At 05:00, 8886 left the <b>postal</b> <b>terminal</b> bound for the old main post office in Købmagergade, hence code K5. At around 05:02AM, 8886 passed and greeted the alfa-south police patrol car near Tivoli.|$|E
40|$|Postal work is {{performed}} {{in very different}} settings, and the works are e. g., drivers, letter carriers, postal sorters, and counter clerks. A finding that {{a small group of}} parcel sorters with a good psychosocial work situation had much lower health complaints than comparable workers with a worse psychosocial situation at work, indicated that {{it might be possible to}} improve mental and physical health among postal employees by improving work organization. The theoretical framework for this thesis is the demands-control-support (DCS) model by Karasek, Theorell, and Johnson. Two cross-sectional studies were performed with questionnaires. In a study on 144 workers at a <b>postal</b> <b>terminal</b> it was found associations between low support from superiors and high psychological work demands, on one hand and gastrointestinal and sleep problems on the other. In another study on 655 postal workers in 6 different occupations, high psychological work demands and low skill discretion was associated with low-back pain, and low social support at work with neck pain. In this study, the associations differed significantly between men and women. A follow-up study on the <b>postal</b> <b>terminal</b> (136 persons) was performed 8 and 12 months after an organizational change took place. The changes were aimed at improving the shift system, and psychosocial work situation. Authority over decision and skill discretion increased, and sick-leave decreased during the follow up period. Changes in contact with superiors, team-mates, and skill discretion were associated with changes in gastrointestinal and sleep complaints. In another follow up study, 82 individuals were studied before and 1 year after improvement of the psychosocial work environment. Musculoskeletal complaints were significantly reduced in the intervention group but not in the control group. Increased support from superiors was associated with less symptoms. Younger age and higher authority over decisions at baseline was associated with reduced symptoms at follow-up. The main findings of this thesis are that there are significant associations between psychosocial work situation among postal workers and psychosomatic and musculoskeletal symptoms, and that it is possible to reduce symptoms and sick-leave, by changes of organization, and improvement of the psychosocial work situatio...|$|E

50|$|There are 450 postal {{offices in}} the {{territory}} of Kaluga Oblast, including 349 stationary postal {{offices in the}} rural areas, of Russian Post. The comparative analysis of the postal services network shows {{that in terms of}} the technological intensiveness and staffing levels, the postal services network in Kaluga Oblast {{is one of the most}} advanced in the Central Federal District of Russia. Currently, there are 121 modern POS terminals used in the postal offices of Kaluga Oblast for drawing cash from plastic cards, and there are also 670 <b>postal</b> cash <b>terminals.</b> A chain of 205 Internet cafes (400 seats) was established. The post offices have access to high-speed telecommunication channels, which enables them to electronically process payment of utility bills, and also provide instant money transfer services.|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{demand for}} sending letters, in the {{traditional}} aspect, has decreased because of electronic sources which have replaced {{a big part of}} letter communication. The Postal Service constantly strives for lowering costs and due to the changeable demand, a greater awareness is required regarding recourses and their usage. The previously mentioned measures in combination with commonly occurring quality issues during the collective process at the letter terminal in Alvesta would be improved by applying a lean-perspective to the process. A first step towards saving of time is to apply the “value stream mapping”-method on the collective process for small and large letters. Purpose: To map the process of collection for small and large letters to be able to identify waste of recourses and furthermore give suggestions on how the Postal Service would be able to reduce the waste of recourses identified. Moreover, the purpose is also to illustrate the process of collection, following a reduced waste of recourses, to give the Postal Service an opportunity to obtain saving of time. Method: The report consists of a qualitative case study on the <b>Postal</b> Service’s letter <b>terminal</b> in Alvesta. Data collection has been conducted by literary studying, direct observation and semi structured interviews. Conclusions: Several results have shown in the report, such as the fact that a waste of recourses has been identified in all activities involved in the process of collection. Furthermore, actions have been suggested to reduce the occurring waste in the form of standardized guide lines, reorganization of equipment, working towards a continuous flow and the introduction of numerous flexible workers within the process. How the process of collection for small and large letters can be designed after a decreased waste of resources is illustrated to give the Postal Services a vision to strive for as well as an opportunity to obtain saving of time...|$|R
