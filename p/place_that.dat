5|$|Aspect weavers take {{instructions}} {{known as}} advice specified {{through the use}} of pointcuts and join points, special segments of code that indicate what methods should be handled by aspect code. The implementation of the aspect then specifies whether the related code should be added before, after, or throughout the related methods. By doing this, aspect weavers improve modularity, keeping code in one <b>place</b> <b>that</b> would otherwise have been interspersed throughout various, unrelated classes.|$|E

5|$|A {{high risk}} of severe storms—the first such {{issuance}} since April7, 2006—was issued for {{a large part of}} the Deep South for March1 as the cold front moved eastward. The activity began almost immediately, with several isolated tornadoes taking <b>place</b> <b>that</b> morning across the Mississippi Valley, with one of them leading to the first fatality of the outbreak. Isolated tornadoes were also reported as far north as Illinois, near the center of the low. However, the most intense activity began around noon and continued throughout the afternoon and evening, with southern Alabama and southern Georgia hit the hardest. Nearly continuous supercells formed north of the Gulf of Mexico and produced many tornadoes, some of which hit large population centers with devastating effects. Twenty people were killed by those tornadoes.|$|E

It is one of six historic civilizations to arise independently. Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3150BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology) with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under Menes (often identified with Narmer).

5|$|Application {{of social}} {{sustainability}} requires stakeholders {{to look at}} human and labor rights, prevention of human trafficking, and other human rights risks.

The international community has identified many industries whose practices have been known to violate social sustainability, and many of these industries have organizations in <b>place</b> <b>that</b> aid in verifying the social sustainability of products and services. The Equator Principles (financial industry), Fair Wear Foundation (garments), and Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition are examples of such organizations and initiatives. Resources are also available for verifying the life-cycle of products and the producer or vendor level, such as Green Seal for cleaning products, NSF-140 for carpet production, and even labeling of Organic food in the United States.|$|E
5|$|If a cat so chooses, {{they can}} take a {{different}} calling in life {{as that of a}} medicine cat. Medicine cats, unlike warriors, serve for their clan not through bloodshed, but through peace. They are trained to heal their Clanmates by using the natural resources as medicines; for example, cobwebs can be used to stitch deep wounds, whilst poppy seeds are used to lull a distressed cat into sleep. They sleep separately, surrounded by the herbs and resources they need to keep their Clan safe and healthy. Medicine cat apprentices go through a longer period of training than warriors, due to the vast amount of knowledge they must remember. Medicine cats are also not allowed to take any mates or have any kits. This is because they must care for each member of their Clan equally; if they were to form a loving relationship with any one individual, they may unfairly <b>place</b> <b>that</b> cat’s life over that of the Clan. A Clan tends to have only one or two, and occasionally three, medicine cats at any given time.|$|E

5|$|Leicester House was {{intermittently}} inhabited {{during the}} mid-18th century, and was finally {{sold to the}} naturalist Ashton Lever in 1775.

Brothels started appearing around Leicester Square during the century, and visitors could pay to watch the severed heads of traitors executed at Temple Bar through a telescope. Leicester House became home of a museum of natural curiosities called the Holophusikon in the 1780s. It was demolished in 1791–72 due to rising debts following the extinction of the Leicester peerage, and replaced by Leicester <b>Place.</b> <b>That</b> in turn was converted into a church in 1865 and is now the site of the Prince Charles Cinema.|$|E
