One such application is the suppression of cargo-bay fires in aircraft. Recently, the agents C 2 HF 5 (<b>pentafluoroethane,</b> HFC- 125), and bromotrifluoropropene (C 3 H 2 F 3 Br, 2 -BTP) have been evaluated in a mandated Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) test, in which a simulated explosion of an aerosol can must be suppressed by the agent. Unfortunately, unlike CF 3 Br, either agent, when added at approximately one-half their inerting concentration, created a higher over-pressure in the test chamber than in tests with no agent present (thus failing the test). Similar combustion enhancement has been described in other experiments for certain conditions; however, explanation of the phenomena is lacking. As a first step in understanding this surprising result, the thermodynamics of the chemical systems are examined to predict the over pressure.

This has been achieved using spectroscopic methods, notably photoelectron spectroscopy, u. v. -visible spectroscopy and infrared spectroscopy, as well as kinetics simulations, global modelling and quantum chemical calculations. Photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) was used to investigate the pyrolysis behaviour of two hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) fire suppression agents, <b>pentafluoroethane</b> (CF 3 CHF 2) and 2 -H heptafluoropropane (CF 3 CHFCF 3) to determine their thermal decomposition pathways. The thermal decomposition of flowing <b>pentafluoroethane</b> (CF 3 CHF 2) diluted in argon was studied over the temperature range 600 - 1600 ?C. At lower temperatures, (< 1000 ?C) {{there is evidence of}} production of the thermal decomposition products C 2 F 4 and HF and at higher temperatures (over 1000 ?C) the decomposition products CF 2 and CF 3 H are observed. The adiabatic and vertical ionisation energy (AIE and VIE) have been measured for the first band of CF 3 CHF 2 from the recorded photoelectron spectrum as (12. 71 +- 0. 05) eV and (13. 76 +- 0. 02) eV respectively. The main pathways for decomposition have been established over the temperature range investigated. Pyrolysis of 2 -H heptafluoropropane (CF 3 CHFCF 3), at low pressure, diluted in argon, has been studied over the temperature range 600 - 2000 ?C. Comparison of the results obtained has been made with results of recent electronic structure calculations of possible decomposition pathways. The most favoured reaction thermodynamically, to produce CF 3 CF=CF 2 + HF, is found to be the main decomposition reaction at lower temperatures, 600 - 900 ?C. At higher temperatures, 900 - 1200 ?C, decomposition gave C 2 F 4 + CF 3 H and it was found that C 3 F 6 decomposes to C 2 F 4 + CF 2, and C 2 F 4 decomposes to CF 2 at temperatures above 1400 ?C. Three ozone-alkene reactions (O 3 + ethene, O 3 + 2 -methylpropene (2 MP) and O 3 + 2, 3 dimethyl- 2 -butene (DMB)) were separately investigated, each at low pressure, using a flow-tube interfaced to a photoelectron spectrometer. Photoelectron spectra, recorded as a function of reaction time, have been used to estimate partial pressures of the reagents and products, using photoionisation cross-sections for selected photoelectron bands of the reagents and products, (which have been measured separately) for each reaction. The yields of all the main products have been determined for each reaction. For each reaction, oxygen was observed as a product {{for the first time and}} for the O 3 + ethene reaction acetaldehyde was measured as a product for the first time. Kinetics simulations were performed using reaction schemes which were developed for these reactions in order to determine the main reactions for production of the observed products. A feasibility study was carried out on the first PE bands of four selected non-linear triatomic molecules, SF 2, HO 2, HOCl and Cl 2 O in order to optimise the experimental production conditions for a threshold PES study using synchrotron radiation. Reliable methods were developed to record threshold PE spectra of SF 2, HOCl and Cl 2 O consistently for upwards of 4 hours. The work on HO 2 is still ongoing and the method developed requires further optimisation.

Disposable biomedical devices can be envisioned from these wax designs. While these superhydrophobic surface excel at repelling water, they continue to readily absorb water. Formation of paper that is both superhydrophobic and superoleophobic, or superamphiphobic, is accomplished through a combination of steps: mechanical fiber refining, solvent exchange processing and plasma treatment. The fiber refining creates nano-scale fibrils that are separated in the solvent processing. Subsequent plasma treatment of oxygen etching and fluoropolymer deposition creates superamphiphobic paper, exhibiting contact angles of > 150 degrees for water, ethylene glycol, motor oil and n-hexadecane. Further studies were conducted to increase the strength of these superamphiphobic sheets by using layered paper. Development of superhydrophobic paper from a hydrophilic diamond-like carbon surface coating was also demonstrated. When combined with oxygen plasma etching, diamond-like carbon coated paper sheets attain superhydrophobic properties similar to fluoropolymer coated sheets. Based on the knowledge gained from the studies on paper, superhydrophobic surfaces are created on 304 and 316 stainless steels. Samples are etched in hydrofluoric acid and then passivated in nitric acid to create the necessary surface structure. Deposition of fluoropolymer onto the etched samples yields superhydrophobic properties. Ph. D...|$|E
40|$|Paper and {{cellulosic}} materials hold a good {{promise of}} being candidates for flexible packaging materials provided suitable barrier properties {{such as water}} repellence and grease resistance are imparted to them. One of the methods to achieve these objectives is to surface modify paper/cellulose by applying thin fluorocarbon coatings on the surface. Fluorocarbon thin films produced by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) offer several advantages over the films produced by conventional polymerization means. Plasma deposited films are pinhole-free, chemically inert, insoluble, mechanically tough, thermally stable and highly coherent and adherent to variety of substrates. In this work, we investigate the use of PECVD technique to produce barrier films on paper and cellulosic materials. These films, with composition and properties {{not much different from}} PTFE, repel water and act as a good barrier to lipophilic materials. Two different monomers, <b>pentafluoroethane</b> (PFE; CF 3 CHF 2) and octafluorocyclobutane (OFCB; C 4 F 8), were investigated and compared in terms of deposition rates and final film properties. Various analytical techniques (XPS, FT-IR, SEM, Ellipsometry, Contact Angle Goniometry, etc.) were used to characterize the fluorocarbon films. The fluorocarbon coated paper exhibited hydrophobic character as evidenced by high water contact angles. Although the films allow water vapor diffusion, the films are hydrophobic and are not wetted when liquid water contacts these layers. Based on various thickness of these films deposited on surface of cellulose, there was a minimum PFE film thickness required to achieve a stable hydrophobic behavior. The fluorocarbon films investigated in this work also exhibited good resistance to lipophilic materials (e. g. oils, fatty acids, etc.). While techniques such as oleic acid penetration and TAPPI "oil-kit" test are commonly used in paper industry to qualitatively test the grease barrier properties of paper/cellulose, this work attempts to quantify the grease barrier properties of fluorocarbon coated paper using techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). Finally, the feasibility of deposition of dual layer films by PECVD was investigated using PFE and n-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAM) as precursors for applications in barrier packaging and printing. Ph.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study for the}} investigation of bubble-mediated gas exchange in a dedicated bubble tank is presented. Bubbles were generated by a water jet with adjustable kinetic energy, which entrained a controllable gas volume flux into the water tank. Bubble size distributions in a radius range from 10 μm to 5000 μm and velocity distributions in a range from 70 μm to 3000 μm were measured at 60 positions in the tank by a telecentric optical setup. Trace gas concentrations were measured using a quadrupole mass spectrometer with a silicone membrane inlet in the water phase of a gas tight bubble tank. Fourteen trace gases {{with a wide range}} of solubilities and diffusivities - SF 6, Ne, N 2,HD, D 2, O 2, Kr, <b>Pentafluoroethane,</b> Xe, N 2 O, C 2 H 2, CH 3 Cl, Benzene and DMS - were used to investigate the dependency on these two physico-chemical parameters. Evasion experiments with a variety of conditions were conducted, including salt water (1. 75 % NaCl), the addition of the soluble surfactant Triton X- 100, n-butanol and glycerol. All used additives tend to increase the fraction of small bubbles generated and therefore increase the transfer velocity at constant gas volume flux and energy input. The addition of salt had the strongest effect, leading to an enhancement of the transfer velocity up to a factor of ~ 4. The increase of the transfer velocity adding Triton X- 100 was found to be lower than 5 %. The transition between diffusivity controlled and solubility controlled transfer occurs at solubilities ranging from 0. 05 - 0. 44. The transition is shifted to lower solubilities by a factor of ~ 3 by the addition of salt. Existing models for bubble mediated gas transfer are tested. Simple power law dependencies turn out to be incapable to describe the transfer for the whole range of solubilities and diffusivities. An extension of the parameterization proposed by Woolf et al. (2007) requiring 4 parameters fits the data best. A simple model using only 2 parameters is proposed. Its performance is almost as good as the extended Woolf model...|$|E
