5|$|The Rampart Dam's {{large size}} had a {{correspondingly}} large price tag. The Corps of Engineers anticipated spending $618.4million (1970 dollars) on {{construction of the}} physical dam alone, another $492million for power-generating equipment, and $1.39billion in total. That total included $15.59million for relocating Alaskans from the area to be flooded, $56million for fish and wildlife facilities to mitigate the anticipated losses, and $39.7million for roads and bridges to access the area. After completion of the dam, the Corps of Engineers estimated that operation and maintenance of the project would cost $6.5million annually, including $570,000 for replacement <b>power</b> <b>equipment</b> and $2million {{for the maintenance of}} fish and wildlife facilities.|$|E
5|$|The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) {{assisted}} in coordinating preparations for Emily. The United States Department of Defense sent <b>power</b> <b>equipment,</b> previously {{used during the}} Great Flood of 1993, to Fort Bragg, while the United States Department of Agriculture stockpiled food in risk zones. Power companies deliberately shut off the power in the Outer Banks to reduce damage to the system and mitigate the risk of electrocutions. At Naval Station Norfolk, 28ships sailed out to sea to ride out the storm; aircraft were evacuated, and nonessential personnel were sent home. The North Carolina government announced ahead of the storm {{that it would not}} create a State Disaster Fund, instead relying on private relief organizations such as the American Red Cross and the Salvation Army. The state's park service pre-positioned 60members with chainsaws to help clear downed trees. Because Emily hit during the busy Labor Day weekend, the tourism industry suffered about $10million in business losses. Many of the evacuees relocated to southeastern Virginia, which saw greatly increased business during the weekend.|$|E

Unfortunately for the manufacturers, some firefighters sabotaged the device and its use of the first engine was discontinued. However, the need and the utility of <b>power</b> <b>equipment</b> ensured {{the success of the}} steam pumper well into the twentieth century.

25|$|The Brown Line Capacity Expansion Project—which {{ran from}} 2006 to 2009—was {{undertaken}} to repair aging infrastructure and increase passenger capacity at Brown Line stations. On February 20, 2006, the CTA broke {{ground on the}} project. All {{but one of the}} Brown Line stations were reconstructed to be ADA compliant and to accommodate eight-car trains. The right-of-way between Kimball and Rockwell Avenue was modernized. Traction <b>power</b> <b>equipment</b> and train control systems were upgraded and a new fiber optic communication network installed. Merchandise Mart was the only station not to receive any work as it had previously been reconstructed from 1987 to 1988, and was already ADA compliant and able to accommodate 8-car trains. Another two stations—Kimball and Western—received small platform extensions but little other work, and the other 16 stations were completely rebuilt.|$|E
25|$|The {{first task}} was to obtain ships more {{suitable}} than the Harold or the Argosy. Such a ship was the freighterpassenger, FP-47, acquired by Signal Corps in March 1944, at Sydney. The Army had built her in the United States in 1942, a sturdy, wooden, diesel-driven vessel only 114 feet long, but broad, of 370 tons, intended {{for use in the}} Aleutians. Instead she had sailed to Australia as a tug. The Signal Corps fitted her with Australian transmitters and receivers, also with an SCR-300 walkietalkie, two SCR-808's, and an SCR-608, plus <b>power</b> <b>equipment,</b> antennas, and, finally, quarters for the Signal Corps operators. The Australian sets were intended for long-range CW signals operating in the high frequencies; the SCRs were short-range VHF FM radios for use in the fleet net and for ship-toshore channels. Armed with antiaircraft weapons and machine guns (served by 12 enlisted men of the Army ship and gun crews), navigated by a crew of 6 Army Transport Service officers and the 12 men already mentioned, the FP-47 was ready for service in June. Her Signal Corps complement consisted of one officer and 12 men.|$|E
