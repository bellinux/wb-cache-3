These include: student aspirations and destinations, motivations, access, learning experience, peer and tutor support. It is hoped the findings can inform the future development of adult higher vocational education provision in rural areas, where opportunities have, in the past, been very limited, and encourage further application of the anchor institution model for widening participation elsewhere...|$|R

The aim of the research is then described as an assessment of whether the resource which the <b>private</b> <b>training</b> <b>providers</b> represent could be better utilised to increase training capacity within Scotland and thereby contribute towards achieving the Targets related to level III SVQs which are proving particularly elusive. In Chapter 2 the research methodology to be used is discussed, followed in Chapter 3 by the results of the literature review which confirms the lack of any research on <b>private</b> <b>training</b> <b>providers.</b> The field research is documented in Chapters 4, 5 and 6, describing and analysing in chronological order the data gathered through the use of a postal survey followed by interviews with selected <b>private</b> <b>training</b> <b>providers</b> and national and regional agencies.

40|$|As the {{teaching}} professions face rapidly changing demands, educators require an increasingly broad {{and more sophisticated}} set of competences than before. In particular the ubiquity of digital devices and the duty to help students become digitally competent requires educators {{to develop their own}} digital competence. On International and national level a number of frameworks, self-assessment tools and training programmes have been developed to describe the facets of digital competence for educators and to help them assess their competence, identify their training needs and offer targeted training. Analysing and clustering these instruments, this report presents a common European Framework for the Digital Competence of Educators (DigCompEdu). DigCompEdu is a scientifically sound background framework which helps to guide policy and can be directly adapted to implement regional and national tools and training programmes. In addition, it provides a common language and approach that will help the dialogue and exchange of best practices across borders. The DigCompEdu framework is directed towards educators at all levels of education, from early childhood to higher and adult education, including general and vocational training, special needs education, and non-formal learning contexts. It aims to provide a general reference frame for developers of Digital Competence models, i. e.

40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. The {{unemployment}} rate {{has become a}} major concern for policy makers in South Africa and therefore the National Plan for Higher Education states that higher education <b>training</b> <b>providers</b> should produce more graduates to address this problem. This resulted in a labour force that has grown rapidly and has become younger and more educated. It would therefore be expected that graduates with a post–matric tertiary qualification would be in high demand, resulting in a low graduate {{unemployment rate}}. The reality is that the unemployment rate among graduates has increased. This is not only a concern for the policymakers of South Africa but also for a <b>private</b> higher education <b>training</b> <b>provider</b> situated in the North West Province, specialising in information technology (IT) qualifications (and whose students and alumni participated in this study as part of the study population). The majority of the IT jobs available to their students are in the Gauteng province which means their graduates often need to relocate. As for all other entry level graduates they also have to make choices – when to decline or accept a job offer. This study determines what the expectations of these entry level IT graduates are and the factors that might influence their decision to accept or decline a job offer. For the <b>training</b> <b>provider</b> {{it is important to know}} what the challenges are that their graduates encounter. The factors contributing to unemployment among these IT graduates were also investigated. Master...|$|R

40|$|Master of EducationThis thesis {{examines}} the nature, role {{and significance of}} private training provision from an intersectoral perspective, and {{in the context of}} the emerging training market in Australia. In so doing, it explores and charts the terrain of a hitherto neglected sector of post-secondary vocational education and training (VET). The report begins by examining the historical and policy context in which private providers have assumed unprecedented importance. It traces the emergence of the 'open training market' (OTM) as the central organising principle of the National Training Reform Agenda, and defines the underlying principles and forces shaping its development. This analysis establishes the link between the OTM and the rise to prominence of <b>private</b> <b>training</b> <b>providers</b> and argues that the OTM is transforming the structure and balance of the post-secondary VET sector. The lack of prior research on <b>private</b> <b>training</b> <b>providers</b> and the private/public interface in the VET sector is highlighted in a review of relevant international and Australian literature. Various taken-for-granted assumptions about the nature and contribution of private providers are identified. Major gaps are identified in our knowledge about <b>private</b> <b>training</b> <b>providers</b> and the development of training markets. The nature and extent of private training provision is then examined on the basis of information collected via national surveys of training authorities. A detailed comparative analysis of the structure, culture and educational profile of private and public providers is undertaken on the basis of six major case studies of commercial and TAFE colleges. This analysis provides the basis for identifying the distinguishing characteristics of private and public provision. It {{examines the}}ir relative positions in the training market, factors affecting their growth and development, and major trends in the training market. The views and perspectives of providers and clients on the private/public alternatives and barriers to the effective implementation of the training market are explored. A series of key policy issues are identified and the implications of adopting a market-based approach to the provision of VET are examined. The thesis concludes that a parallel private training sector is undergoing formation in Australia. It argues that while certain key differences persist, the roles and relationships of private and public providers are being altered in some fundamental ways by the transition to an OTM, and that the nature of VET itself is being redefined in the process. In view of these trends and the potential implications of the shift to a fully fledged market paradigm, serious questions are raised about the current directions of government VET policy.

The surveys run in July and August 2009 captured information {{on the use of}} e-learning in all TAFE institutes, <b>private</b> and enterprise <b>training</b> <b>providers,</b> community education providers and VET in Schools providers. The 2009 survey of RTOs shows that 39 % of all VET activity now formally involves e-learning (on average across all states/territories and provider types). This continues an upward trend which has seen e-learning grow from around 3 - 4 % of all VET unit enrolments in 2003 - 2004. The survey clearly demonstrates the value which the vocational education and training (VET) sector has placed on a flexible learning experience. Technology is providing greater choice and control over where, when and how training is being delivered. The flexibility of e-learning has also expanded the choices for learner groups including remote learners and learners re-entering the workforce. Student and teacher/trainer attitudes towards, and experiences of, e-learning in VET also demonstrate an acceptance of and expectation for e-learning, often as part of a blended learning experience. E-learning is enabling a more engaging and personalised learning experience which can be tailored to suit individual learning and skill needs...|$|R

The study explores the correlation of local economic policies that enhance collective efficiency {{on the performance of}} SMEs. The empirical research in two Indonesian clusters shows that collective efficiency has a positive impact on the performance of SMEs. However, since performance of a cluster is also related to its life cycle, the impact of collective efficiency can decrease in line with the growth of number of enterprises, resulting in declining performance. The empirical research also highlights that the improvement of soft locational factors that address the diversification of networks and creation of extended trust as well as the promotion of innovation and specialisation can reinforce collective efficiency, and furthermore increases the performance of the whole cluster. Especially those soft locational factors, which focus on diversification of network actors, play an important role.
