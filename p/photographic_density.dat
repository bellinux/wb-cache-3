30|$|In {{the process}} of deducing <b>photographic</b> <b>density,</b> its value is {{represented}} as Hounsfield units in CT and as raw values in panoramic radiograph. In the case of CT, the <b>photographic</b> <b>density</b> is readjusted as Hounsfield units {{through a process of}} standardization every day such that water has a value of zero. Therefore, it could be assigned by absolute value only. However, in radiography, there is no such standardization process and comparison of absolute values among different images is meaningless due to error in {{the process of}} moving osseous tissue from 3 D to 2 D depending on posture or the angle at the time of image photographing. In particular, the same value is not represented when photographing the same patient twice, even when <b>photographic</b> <b>density</b> at the same position is measured (Fig.  2 b). On the other hand, comparing each part in one sheet of a single panoramic photograph is considered relatively standardized. Comparing <b>photographic</b> <b>density</b> of two different parts in one image should be sufficiently standardized that clinicians can use panoramic radiographs in the diagnostic process.|$|E
30|$|As {{clarified}} by {{the results}} of this study, suppurative type of osteomyelitis could generate a conditional inference tree using differences in the avg. value and min value of <b>photographic</b> <b>density</b> and the patient group could be classified from the normal control group based on a probability of 96.8 %. Sclerosing type osteomyelitis could similarly generate a conditional inference tree using differences in avg., min, and max values of <b>photographic</b> <b>density,</b> and the patient group could be classified from normal control group based on a probability of 94.1 %. As differences in <b>photographic</b> <b>density</b> of the focus site of each patient normal site are biased to one side (positive or negative side), when performing relative classification, it is considered that the error may not be significant.|$|E

40|$|There {{are many}} {{exquisite}} densitometers for {{the measurement of}} the <b>photographic</b> <b>densities</b> of plates and films, but they are too expensive for us and the authors tried with success to construct a simple densitometer by using an ordinary Duboscq-color-imeter. The principle {{is the same as}} when a Duboscq-colorimeter is used for the comparison of two liquids. In our case oue liquid is replaced by a photographic plate and the intensities of the light pencils transmitted through the plate and the standard liquid are matched with each other and the photographic intensity is read from the depth of the standard liquid, for which, after many trials, a suspension of carbon black of a moderate particle size was used with a small quantity of polyvinylalcohol as a stabilizer. As a yellow light filtered only by a solution of K_ 2 Cr_ 2 O_ 7 was used, which was not exactly monochromatic, it was necessary for us to use a carbon black of a moderatetsize, otherwise the color tones of the two light pencils compared do not matchor the suspension is too unstable.

40|$|Methods are {{described}} {{for determining the}} relative mass of particles in electron microscope specimens through the measurement of <b>photographic</b> <b>densities</b> in recorded images. These methods were applied to a quantitative study of the amounts of electron stains that could {{be associated with the}} particles of tomato bushy stunt virus (BSV) and tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). In the pH range above 2 where the viruses are stable, the amount of stain absorbed is too small to produce adequate contrast in the electron microscope. Maximum stain absorption was achieved at pH about 1 where with several reagents and combinations of reagents the mass of BSV could be increased to about four times that of the unstained particles. Optimum results were obtained with phosphotungstic acid alone or in combination with Pt, Th, or La ions. Since the pH conditions for high stain absorption are normally destructive, morphology is satisfactorily preserved only when the phosphotungstic acid is applied in concentrations of 10 per cent or greater or when the use of destructive reagents is preceded by a preliminary fixation under mild conditions. Maximum staining of TMV increased the mass of the particles to about two times that of the unstained. Estimates of the mass of heavily stained BSV particles indicate that their density is 3. 3 gm. /cm. 3 The high internal hydration of BSV probably accounts for the greater stain absorption and penetration compared to those of TMV which has very low or zero internal hydration. Anomalous images resulting from the use of electron stains are shown and discussed...|$|R

40|$|An Intensity Scale Sensitometer {{for testing}} the {{photographic}} response of Graphic Arts materials was built and evaluated. The sensitometer utilizes a stepped area diaphragm and a cylindrical lens {{to produce a}} stepped illuminance distribution at the film plane. Both tungsten and pulsed xenon lamps are provided.

A scanning aperture type shutter located at the stepped diaphragm and a knife edge aperture located at the lens are used to control exposure duration and intensity. The main advantage of this sensitometer is the production of an intensity scale without interposing a light absorbing step wedge.

40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. A method for mapping snow over large areas was developed combining {{the possibilities of}} a Quantimet (QTM 72) to evaluate the exact density level of the snow cover for each individual image (or a selected section of the photo) with the higher resolution of <b>photographic</b> techniques. The <b>density</b> level established on the monitor by visual control is used as reference for the exposure time of a lithographic film, producing a clear tonal separation of all snow- and ice-covered areas from uncovered land in black and white. The data is projected onto special maps 1 : 500, 000 or 1 : 100, 000 showing the contour lines and the hydrographic features only. The areal extent of the snow cover may be calculated directly with the QTM 720 or on the map. Bands 4 and 5 provide the most accurate results for mapping snow.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this survey}} was to test a {{standardised}} method to follow the demographic evolution of a dense aggregative 'forest' population of the temperate gorgonian Eunicella verrucosa (Octocorallia, Gorgoniidae) using in situ <b>photographic</b> recordings. Distribution, <b>density,</b> growth and demographic evolution of the colonies was compared along two parallel transects. Computer treatment allowed the estimation of the total branch fan surface area, and the individual growth of tagged colonies was determined by measuring the increase in this surface area, using consec- utive photographs taken at two-year intervals. To integrate the potential bias of branch overlapping, we proposed a correction factor between the in situ photographic surface area and the surface area of the gorgonian calculated from ex situ photographic surface area with all branches deployed. The surface-frequency distribution of colonies was converted to estimated-age-frequency distribution using an estimated growth curve based on the net growth rate. The technique used revealed significant differences in population structure and the dynamics of gorgonian colo- nies, as the two transects appeared {{to be influenced by}} different environmental conditions. The recruitment also seemed to vary according to year and transect, resulting in different densities. Our work showed clear results in characterising the variations of gorgonian demographic evolution at a small spatial scale; thus, it is assumed that this method could be a sustainable tool for coastal envi- ronmental managers...|$|R
40|$|Photosynthetic {{plasticity}} of two congeneric shrub species growing under natural {{field conditions}} was compared along transects spanning two canopy gaps in a Costa Rican rain forest. Piper arieianum is a shadetolerant species common in successional and mature forests, whereas P. sancti-felicis is a pioneer species abundant in abandoned clearings and large gaps. Twenty potted cuttings of each species were placed {{at regular intervals}} along two east-west transects crossing a small branch-fall gap and a large tree-fall gap. Along the transects, the percent of full sun photon flux density varied from less than 2 % to 45 %. After six months of growth under these conditions, leaves were monitored for incident photon flux <b>density,</b> <b>photographic</b> measures of light availability, photosynthetic capacity (Amax), leaf nitrogen content, leaf chlorophyll content, and specific leaf mass. Although both species demonstrated considerable plasticity in Amax across gap transects, P. sancti-felicis leaves had a superior capacity to track closely variation in light availability, particularly in the larger gap. For regressions of Amax on measures of light availability, P. sancti-felicis consistently showed a 3. 5 to 5 -fold higher coefficient of determination (R 2) and a 3 to 4 -fold higher slope than P. arieianum. In both species leaf nitrogen content per leaf area increased significantly with light availability, although P. sancti-felicis, again, showed a much stronger relationship between these variables. Across the transects, mean chlorophyll content per unit leaf area {{did not differ significantly}} between the species, whereas mean chlorophyll content per unit leaf dry mass was 3 -times greater in leaves of P. sancti-felicis. Piper arieianum exhibited highly significant increases in chlorophyll a:b ratio with increased light availability, whereas P. sancti-felicis lacked significant variation in this trait across a gradient of light availability. Mean specific leaf mass did not vary significantly between species across the gap transects. The nature of the light acclimatory response differs quantitatively and qualitatively between these species. An important constraint on light acclimation of the shade-tolerant P. arieianum is its inability to increase photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency under conditions of high light availability. The lack of plasticity in chlorophyll a:b ratios does not restrict light acclimation of Amax in P. sancti-felicis. Leaves of P. arieianum exhibited symptoms of chronic photoinhibition in exposed microsites within the large gap. Species differences in the capacity to finely adjust Amax across a wide range of light conditions may be attributed to their maximum growth potential. Light acclimation in species with low maximum growth potential may be constrained at the cellular level by rates of protein and chlorophyll synthesis and at the whole-plant level by low maximum rates of uptake and supply of nutrients and water. For P. arieianum, restriction of photosynthetic plasticity is likely to limit competitive abilities of plants in high-light conditions of large gaps and clearings, whereas observed habitat restrictions for P. sancti-felicis do not appear to depend upon the highly-developed capacity for adjustment of Amax observed in this species. © 1992 Springer-Verlag...|$|R

30|$|There was {{an effort}} to {{standardize}} imaging errors that depend on the posture of the patient at the time of radiographing.

30|$|The biggest {{limitation}} {{of this study is to}} overcome the low reproducibility of panoramic radiography itself. <b>Photographic</b> <b>density,</b> image size, or location may vary depending on photographing posture and other detailed settings, meaning that the reliability of data being obtained through quantitative analysis is questionable. For this objective, it is impossible to perform standardization for all the patients through pre-treatment. However, as mentioned previously, panoramic radiography is being widely utilized as an assistant diagnostic tool in the field for observing prognosis and concerns regarding this limitation are essentially raising doubt about using panoramic radiography itself. And also, unlike CT, which uses the same blackening leveling method in all programs, it could not be proved that our suggested program will be applicated in other digital panorama software program, because the other program will use the blackening degree relative value calculation methods only for the program itself.|$|E
30|$|Under this background, in this study, <b>photographic</b> <b>density</b> of {{both sides}} was {{compared}} by dividing the digital panoramic radiograph of patients with osteomyelitis based on the median line.

Any error due to manual designation of the ROI was minimized by generating one panoramic radiograph with a rectangular ROI with length and width designed to give an area of 100 [*]mm 2 with rounding to the first digit of decimal point. Because the value obtained in this manner is not meaningful as an absolute value, the difference values obtained by subtracting the min, max, and avg. values of the normal area {{from those of the}} focus area were designated as the representative values of each image.|$|E
30|$|Existing {{research}} on radiographic reading of osteomyelitis is limited. According to one research study of reading acute osteomyelitis radiographically, {{during the first}} 2 [*]weeks, {{three out of four}} sheets of radiographic photographs showed normal images, and even when extended to the first 4 [*]weeks, it was much harder to read images at an early stage than to read pathologic findings in only 3 persons among total 8 patients. In a re-photographed image after 4 [*]weeks, pathologic findings could be clearly confirmed [12]. The above studies confirmed that the accuracy and reproducibility of reading modes for qualitative panoramic images could not be perfect, and as just one wrong diagnosis may lead to a fatal prognosis, supplementary measures shall be taken. In this respect, if osteomyelitis could be diagnosed at an early stage based on a probability of 88.1 % through the method used in this study, such a method could be used in the situation of dental clinicians without the need for a radiologist. Furthermore, digitalized analysis can show the ossification state indirectly by the <b>photographic</b> <b>density.</b> In this way, the method could also be used for post-operative regular checkups of osteomyelitis patients.|$|E

40|$|Experimental {{realization}} of Fourier plane filters {{for use in}} a coherent optical deblurring system for pictures affected hy space­ invariant blurs is discussed. Linear motion blur and defocusing are the two types of blurs considered. A method of developing phase­ inverting filters as diffraction gratings is given. The amplitude filters to go with the phase-inverting filters are developed as density variations on photographic films. The results of deblurring both linear motion blurred objects and out-of-focus pictures are presented and the degree of deblurring achieved is discussed. It is found that increasing the noise tenn in the amplitude filter results in loss of resolution in the deblurred output. Linear motion blurred object is then processed with an 'amplitude only' filter after subjecting the input object to a further blur of the same nature and amount as the original blur. Deblurring filters are also developed as binary holograms and the deblurred outputs presented and discussed. Loss of resolution in the output due to coarse amplitude quantization levels in a binary hologram filter is reduced by splitting the amplitude part of the filter into two halves and having only one of the halves encoded in the binary hologram filter while the other is produced as a <b>photographic</b> <b>density</b> variation.
