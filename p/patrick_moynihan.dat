5|$|In late 1998, when long-time Senator Daniel <b>Patrick</b> <b>Moynihan</b> of New York {{announced}} his retirement, Rangel {{was one of}} the first to advocate that First Lady Hillary Clinton move to New York and run for the seat. She did so, successfully.|$|E
5|$|The family {{structure}} of African-Americans {{has long been}} a matter of national public policy interest. The 1965 report by Daniel <b>Patrick</b> <b>Moynihan,</b> known as The Moynihan Report, examined the link between black poverty and {{family structure}}. It hypothesized that the destruction of the Black nuclear family structure would hinder further progress toward economic and political equality.|$|E
5|$|The race {{began in}} November 1998 when four-term {{incumbent}} New York Senator Daniel <b>Patrick</b> <b>Moynihan</b> announced his retirement. Both the Democratic Party and Republican Party sought high-profile candidates {{to compete for}} the open seat. By early 1999 Clinton and Mayor of New York City Rudolph Giuliani were the likely respective nominees. Clinton and her husband, President Bill Clinton, purchased a house in Chappaqua, New York, in September 1999; she thereby became eligible for the election, although she faced characterizations of carpetbagging since she had never resided in the state before. The lead in statewide polls swung from Clinton to Giuliani and back to Clinton as the campaigns featured both successful strategies and mistakes as well as dealing with current events. In late April and May 2000, Giuliani's medical, romantic, marital, and political lives all collided in a tumultuous four-week period, culminating in his withdrawing from the race on May 19.|$|E

5|$|When New York's long-serving U.S. Senator Daniel <b>Patrick</b> <b>Moynihan</b> {{announced}} his retirement in November 1998, several prominent Democratic figures, including Representative Charles Rangel of New York, urged Clinton to run for Moynihan's open seat in the Senate election of 2000. Once she decided to run, the Clintons purchased a home in Chappaqua, New York, north of New York City, in September 1999. She became the first First Lady of the United States to {{be a candidate for}} elected office. Initially, Clinton expected to face Rudy Giuliani (the mayor of New York City) as her Republican opponent in the election. Giuliani withdrew from the race in May 2000 after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and matters related to his failing marriage became public and Clinton instead faced Rick Lazio, a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives representing New York's 2nd congressional district. Throughout the campaign, opponents accused Clinton of carpetbagging, as she had never resided in New York nor participated in the state's politics before the 2000 Senate race.|$|E

Due to his high profile and visibility Giuliani {{was supported by the}} state Republican Party. Giuliani's entrance led Democratic Congressman Charles Rangel and others to recruit then-U.S. First Lady Hillary Clinton to run for Moynihan's seat, hoping she might combat his star power.|$|E

25|$|The Executive Mansion was retaken by Democrats in 1974 and {{remained}} under Democratic control for 20 years under Hugh Carey and Mario Cuomo. Latecentury Democrats became more centrist, including US Senator Daniel <b>Patrick</b> <b>Moynihan</b> (1977–2001) and New York City Mayor Ed Koch (1978–1989), while state Republicans began to align {{themselves with the}} more conservative national party. They gained power through the elections of Senator Alfonse D'Amato in 1980, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in 1993, and Governor George Pataki in 1994. New York remained {{one of the most}} liberal states. In 1984, Ronald Reagan was the last Republican to carry the state, although Republican Michael Bloomberg served as New York City mayor in the early 21st century.|$|E
25|$|President Lyndon B. Johnson {{also led}} his administration's War on Poverty. He {{appointed}} Daniel <b>Patrick</b> <b>Moynihan</b> as Assistant Secretary of Labor. Mitchell was criticized by {{some in the}} black community for his support of Moynihan during this period, as the latter had written a controversial book analyzing issues of the black family in the United States and poverty. Moynihan later became known as a noted U.S. Senator from New York. In addition, Mitchell defended the State of Israel during its war of 1967 against Arab states and was criticized by some. Mitchell was among the African-American leaders with whom President Johnson met after Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., was assassinated in April 1968.|$|E
25|$|By the 1950s, Pennsylvania Avenue {{was marked}} by deteriorating homes, shops, and office {{buildings}} {{on the north side}} and monumental Neoclassical federal office buildings on the south side. President John F. Kennedy noticed the dilapidated condition of the street when his inaugural procession traversed Pennsylvania Avenue in 1961. Kennedy established the Ad Hoc Committee on Federal Office Space to recommend new structures to accommodate the growing federal government (which had constructed almost no new office buildings in the city since the Great Depression). Assistant Secretary of Labor Daniel <b>Patrick</b> <b>Moynihan</b> was assigned to help staff the committee. But in writing the Ad Hoc Committee's final report, Moynihan went beyond the committee's mandate and proposed (in part) that Pennsylvania Avenue be redeveloped using the powers of the federal government.|$|E
25|$|On September 5, {{two weeks}} after the riot had been controlled, Anthony Graziosi, an Italian sales {{representative}} with a white beard dressed in dark business attire, was driving in the neighborhood. As he stopped at a traffic light at 11pm, six blocks away from where Yankel Rosenbaum had been murdered, a group of four black men surrounded his car and one of them shot and killed him. It was alleged by Graziosi's family and their attorney, as well as Senator Al D'Amato, Senator Daniel <b>Patrick</b> <b>Moynihan,</b> State Attorney General Robert Abrams, former Mayor Ed Koch, and a number of advocacy organizations, that Graziosi's resemblance to a Hasidic Jew precipitated his murder. The New York Police Department, Mayor Dinkins, newspaper columnist Mike McAlary, and the U.S. Justice Department did not agree. The murder was not treated as a bias crime.|$|E
25|$|Irving Kristol and Leo Strauss were {{founders of}} the movement. The {{magazines}} Commentary and Public Interest were their key outlets, as well as op-ed articles for major newspapers and position papers for think tanks. Activists around Democratic senator Henry Jackson became deeply involved as well. Prominent spokesmen include Gertrude Himmelfarb, Bill Kristol, Paul Wolfowitz, Lewis Libby, Norman Podhoretz, Richard Pipes, David Horowitz, Charles Krauthammer, Richard Perle, Robert Kagan, Elliott Abrams and Ben Wattenberg. Meanwhile, Senator Daniel <b>Patrick</b> <b>Moynihan</b> was highly sympathetic but remained a Democrat. Some of Strauss' influential neoconservative disciples included Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork, Paul Wolfowitz (who became Deputy Secretary of Defense), Alan Keyes (who became Assistant Secretary of State), William Bennett (who became Secretary of Education), Weekly Standard editor William Kristol, political philosopher Allan Bloom, writer John Podhoretz, college president John Agresto, political scientist Harry V. Jaffa and novelist Saul Bellow.|$|E
25|$|Novak’s wife, Geraldine, began regular churchgoing in {{the early}} 1990s and {{eventually}} settled on St Patrick’s Catholic Church, Washington, D.C. One day she persuaded Novak, who had not attended religious services for nearly 30 years, to join her at Mass. The celebrant was Fr. Peter Vaghi, whom he had known before Vaghi switched from politics to the priesthood. Novak then started to go to Mass regularly and decided to convert a few years later. According to Novak, the turning point came when he visited Syracuse University to lecture. Before he spoke, he was seated at a dinner table near a female student who wore a cross necklace. Novak {{asked her if she}} was Catholic and she asked him the same. Novak said he had been going to Mass each Sunday for the last four years, but had not converted. “Mr Novak,” the young woman replied, “life is short, but eternity is forever.” That brief sentence chilled Novak, who felt the student had channeled the Holy Spirit. When he got home and told Geraldine, they {{decided it was time to}} convert. In May 1998 Novak was received into the Roman Catholic Church at the age of 67 and became a Traditionalist Catholic. Geraldine was already a Catholic. Al Hunt, Judy Woodruff, Fred Barnes, Margaret Carlson, Daniel <b>Patrick</b> <b>Moynihan,</b> Henry Hyde, and Rick Santorum attended Novak’s baptism, with some of them openly crying.|$|E

500|$|The United States abstained {{from most}} of the UN resolutions censuring the Indonesian invasion.

500|$|Truman {{has had his}} latter-day {{critics as}} well. After a review of {{information}} available to Truman {{about the presence of}} espionage activities in the U.S. government, Democratic Senator Daniel <b>Patrick</b> <b>Moynihan</b> concluded that Truman was [...] "almost wilfully obtuse" [...] concerning the danger of American communism. In 2010, historian Alonzo Hamby concluded that [...] "Harry Truman remains a controversial president." [...] However, since leaving office, Truman has fared well in polls ranking the presidents. He has never been listed lower than ninth, and was ranked fifth in a C-SPAN poll in 2009.|$|E
500|$|Sotomayor {{had wanted}} to become a judge since she was in {{elementary}} school, and in 1991 she was recommended for a spot by Democratic New York senator Daniel <b>Patrick</b> <b>Moynihan.</b> Moynihan had an unusual bipartisan arrangement with his fellow New York senator, Republican Al D'Amato, whereby he would get to choose roughly {{one out of every four}} New York district court seats even though a Republican was in the White House. Moynihan also wanted to fulfill a public promise he had made to get a Hispanic judge appointed for New York. When Moynihan's staff recommended her to him, they said [...] "Have we got a judge for you!" [...] Moynihan identified with her socio-economic and academic background and became convinced she would become the first Hispanic Supreme Court justice. D'Amato became an enthusiastic backer of Sotomayor, who was seen as politically centrist at the time. Of the impending drop in salary from private practice, Sotomayor said: [...] "I've never wanted to get adjusted to my income because I knew I wanted to go back to public service. And in comparison to what my mother earns and how I was raised, it's not modest at all." ...|$|E
