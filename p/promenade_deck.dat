5|$|Additionally, {{he might}} have had {{business}} with J. Bruce Ismay, chairman of the White Star Line; in any case, Ismay had invited Hays to join him on the RMS Titanic. Hays, his wife, Clara, his daughter, Orian (see source note), his son-in-law, Thornton Davidson, his secretary, Mr. Vivian Payne, and a maid, Miss Mary Anne Perreault, shared a deluxe suite (cabin B69) on the <b>Promenade</b> <b>Deck.</b>|$|E
5|$|She {{was fitted}} {{out over the}} {{remainder}} of late 1892 and early 1893. Electric lighting was used, and she was elegantly furnished. Her grand saloon and skylighted <b>promenade</b> <b>deck</b> contained several fountains and a large aquarium filled with trout and other fish of the lakes. The cabins and public spaces were fitted out with oak paneling, velvet carpets, etched glass windows, leather furniture and marble. Shops and restaurants were provided for the passengers.|$|E
5|$|The {{lifeboats}} were lowered {{every few}} minutes on each side, {{but most of the}} boats were greatly under-filled. No.5 left with 41 aboard, No.3 had 32 aboard, No.8 left with 39 and No.1 left with just 12 out of a capacity of 40. The evacuation did not go smoothly and passengers suffered accidents and injuries as it progressed. One woman fell between lifeboat No.10 and the side of the ship but someone caught her by the ankle and hauled her back onto the <b>promenade</b> <b>deck,</b> where she made a second successful attempt at boarding. First-class passenger Annie Stengel broke several ribs when an overweight German-American doctor and his brother jumped into No.5, squashing her and knocking her unconscious. The lifeboats' descent was likewise risky. No.6 was nearly flooded during the descent by water discharging out of the ship's side, but successfully made it away from the ship. No.3 came close to disaster when, for a time, one of the davits jammed, threatening to pitch the passengers out of the lifeboat and into the sea.|$|E

25|$|Although not {{mentioned}} in any source, photographic {{evidence suggests that the}} Aleksandr Pushkins superstructure was enlarged at some point during her career (probably during her 1972 rebuilding), with the forward superstructure expanded and rear <b>promenade</b> <b>decks</b> built in.|$|R
50|$|The ship {{included}} {{special features}} {{found on the}} more grand ocean liners, including a grand staircase, ballroom, formal dining room, cocktail lounge, spacious and comfortable lounges, wide <b>promenade</b> <b>decks,</b> and private staterooms. She could accommodate 2,000 passengers and up to 60 vehicles on her car deck.|$|R
5|$|Titanic had a {{total of}} 20 lifeboats, {{comprising}} 16wooden boats on davits, 8 {{on either side of}} the ship, and 4 collapsible boats with wooden bottoms and canvas sides. The collapsibles were stored upside down with the sides folded in, and would have to be erected and moved to the davits for launching. Two were stored under the wooden boats and the other two were lashed atop the officers' quarters. The position of the latter would make them extremely difficult to launch, as they weighed several tons each and had to be manhandled down to the boat deck. On average, the lifeboats could take up to 68 people each, and collectively they could accommodate 1,178– barely half the number of people on board and a third of the number the ship was licensed to carry. The shortage of lifeboats was not because of a lack of space nor because of cost. Titanic had been designed to accommodate up to 68lifeboats– enough for everyone on board– and the price of an extra 32lifeboats would only have been some , a tiny fraction of the $7.5 million that the company had spent on Titanic. In an emergency, lifeboats at the time were intended to be used to transfer passengers off the distressed ship and onto a nearby vessel. It was therefore commonplace for liners to have far fewer lifeboats than needed to accommodate all their passengers and crew, and of the 39British liners of the time of over , 33 had too few lifeboat places to accommodate everyone on board. The White Star Line desired the ship to have a wide <b>promenade</b> <b>deck</b> with uninterrupted views of the sea, which would have been obstructed by a continuous row of lifeboats.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to being}} planned for liner service, Hamburg was {{designed}} with spacious cabins, {{most of which}} (306 out of 326) feature full bath-tubs, a feature not found on many ships built since. The deluxe cabins located on <b>promenade</b> <b>deck</b> additionally feature floor-to-ceiling windows and separate bedrooms and living rooms.|$|E
25|$|Situated on the <b>promenade</b> <b>deck</b> was a tea room {{which was}} paneled in grey {{sycamore}} and mahogany. Below this {{there was the}} Lady's Saloon, which was finished in satin wood and walnut. The smoke room with adjacent bar was situated in the after part of the deck-house on the shelter deck.|$|E

50|$|Volendam is an R-Class {{cruise ship}} {{operated}} by Holland America Line as a subsidiary company of Carnival Cruise Lines. She has three sister {{ships in the}} fleet, Zaandam, Amsterdam and Rotterdam. She was the second of these ships to be launched, the Rotterdam being the lead ship of the class. Volendam is 238 m, a 32.3 m beam, and a 8.1 m draft. She has ten decks, and contains cabins for passengers (called staterooms) on decks one through three (Dolphin, Main and Lower <b>Promenade</b> <b>decks),</b> and decks six, seven and eight (Verandah, Navigation, and Lido decks).|$|R
25|$|Ben-my-Chree's {{design was}} very much suited to the Edwardian era. Her five decks {{consisted}} of lower, main, shelter, promenade and boat decks, and offered ample room for her passengers. The <b>promenade</b> <b>deck</b> extended over two-thirds of the vessel's length. Above the <b>promenade</b> <b>deck</b> was the boat deck, extending over half of her length and affording ample shelter to passengers during inclement weather. The shelter deck was carried right fore and aft, and on each side there was a fine promenade. The centre of this deck consisted of cabins and public rooms while on the two decks below (the main and lower) there were additional public saloons. The first class passengers occupied the forward part {{of the ship and}} the second class the after part. There was a wide companionway forward allowing access to all decks via stairways.|$|E
25|$|The Saxonia class {{ships were}} built to a classic ocean liner appearance, {{with a black}} hull, long bow, {{slightly}} rounded terraced forward superstructure and a tiered aft superstructure. They however lacked the traditional outward projecting <b>promenade</b> <b>deck</b> and had an unusual funnel with a rounded top. Due to their cargo-carrying capabilities, there were four large cranes on both the bow and aft deck.|$|E
25|$|Deckhouses on the France's {{superstructure}} {{were built}} of aluminium, {{to reduce the}} ship's weight and thereby conserve fuel in operation. Within the superstructure a full-length outdoor <b>promenade</b> <b>deck</b> was designed into {{both sides of the}} Pont Canots. Unlike on many other ships, this deck did not wrap completely around the ship, being blocked at the forward end by cabins built in behind the bridgescreen.|$|E
25|$|They {{planned to}} develop the land {{adjacent}} to Queen Mary, and upgrade, renovate and restore the ship. During their management, staterooms were updated with iPod docking stations and flatscreen TVs and the ship's three funnels and waterline area were repainted their original Cunard Red color. The portside <b>Promenade</b> <b>Deck's</b> planking was restored and refinished. Many lifeboats were repaired and patched, and the ship's kitchens were renovated with new equipment.|$|R

25|$|Unusually for {{a cruise}} ship of her time, the Homeric was built with a {{somewhat}} ocean liner-like layout, with her dining room in particular reflecting liner-like design, being located on a lower deck. She was also built with a sizeable <b>promenade</b> <b>deck</b> and a one-deck-high theatre. She was built with two swimming pools, one {{to the rear of}} the ship and another amidship which was covered with a magrodome.|$|E
25|$|On Andrea Doria, the {{decision}} to abandon ship was made within 30minutes of impact. A sufficient number of lifeboats {{for all of the}} passengers and crew were positioned {{on each side of the}} Boat Deck. Procedures called for lowering the lifeboats to be fastened alongside the glass-enclosed <b>Promenade</b> <b>Deck</b> (one deck below), where evacuees could step out windows directly into the boats, which would then be lowered down to the sea.|$|E
25|$|Launched {{concurrently}} with Boat 10, with 42 people aboard, {{the last}} of the wooden lifeboats was launched under the supervision of Lightoller at 1:50a.m. with Quartermaster Walter Perkis put in charge. It was actually one of the first lifeboats to be lowered on Captain Smith's suggestion that passengers should be loaded from the <b>Promenade</b> <b>Deck</b> rather than the Boat Deck. However, the captain had forgotten that– unlike on his previous command, Titanics sister ship Olympic– the forward half of the <b>Promenade</b> <b>Deck</b> was enclosed. Lightoller ordered that the windows on the Promenade Deck's enclosure were to be opened, and moved on to deal with the other lifeboats. The windows proved unexpectedly difficult to open and to add to the problems, the lifeboat got caught up on Titanics sounding spar, which projected from the hull immediately below the boat. The spar had to be chopped off to allow the lifeboat to progress. A stack of deck chairs was used as a makeshift staircase to allow passengers to climb up and through the windows and into the boat.|$|E

The ship also has a spa and gym, as well as three swimming pools. Outside, passengers may use the <b>promenade</b> <b>deck</b> or the upper decks. Traditional deck games such as shuffleboard and deck quoits may be played, and a tennis court and golf simulator are available for passenger use.|$|E
25|$|Morgan, who had {{attended}} the Titanic's launching in 1911, {{had a personal}} suite aboard the ship with his own private <b>promenade</b> <b>deck</b> and a bath equipped with specially designed cigar holders. He was reportedly booked on the ship's maiden voyage but instead canceled the trip and remained at the French resort of Aix-les-Bains to enjoy his morning massages and sulfur baths. His last-minute cancellation has fueled speculation among conspiracy theorists that he knew her fate.|$|E
25|$|This second {{plan was}} based on {{converting}} most of her first- and second-class cabins on A and B decks into hotel rooms, and converting the main lounges and dining rooms into banquet spaces. On <b>Promenade</b> <b>Deck,</b> the starboard promenade was enclosed to feature an upscale restaurant and café named Lord Nelson's and Lady Hamilton's; it was themed in the fashion of early-19th century sailing ships. The famed and elegant Observation Bar was redecorated as a western-themed bar.|$|E
2500|$|Shalom was {{designed}} {{according to the}} principles of the era, with engines placed two-thirds aft and two slim funnels placed side-by side instead of the large traditional funnels. The funnel design in particular resembled [...] of Holland America Line and [...] of P, both of which were still under construction at the time Shalom was being designed. Her hull and superstructure design were optimized for transatlantic traffic, with the <b>promenade</b> <b>decks</b> entirely glass-enclosed.|$|R
50|$|The Half Moone {{also serves}} as an event venue with {{approximately}} 23,000 sq ft of event spaces, each of which include interpretation and exhibits. Among the areas available for special event rental are the Bermuda Room, which displays artifacts and objects that tell the historic connections between Virginia and Bermuda; the Half Moone Vista, which includes some facts about the original fort; and the Lido and <b>Promenade</b> <b>Decks,</b> which address functions of those traditional decks on board cruise ships.|$|R
5000|$|... {{the next}} ferry {{built for the}} PJ & MS Co was of very similar {{dimensions}} and machinery, yet displaced two-hundred tons more. This discrepancy is because the Dee Why and Curl Curl had sliding doors fitted to their <b>promenade</b> <b>decks,</b> instead of swinging doors like those on the South Steyne. Spaces enclosed by sliding doors {{at the time were}} classed under British rules as having no tonnage-earning purpose, and so the two-hundred tons this space would have earned was deducted from the displacement of the vessel.|$|R
25|$|As a day boat, a {{substantial}} proportion of Chauncey Vibbards passengers were sightseers rather than travellers. To cater for this clientele, Chauncey Vibbards main saloon was located forward, offering {{the best possible}} views of the picturesque scenery of the Hudson. A <b>promenade</b> <b>deck</b> was also installed. Considered of no less importance, perhaps, was the boat's extensive larderfrom which it is said almost anything could be ordered. Chauncey Vibbards captain was Dave Hitchcock, a partner of Van Santvoord.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the name}} Bermuda Star, {{the ship was}} {{undergoing}} a $25 million ($ today) overhaul by Southwest Marine, Inc at the Port of Portland, Oregon in December 1989 when a fire broke out on board. The fire resulted in a five alarm response and five of the crew went to a local hospital for treatment of smoke inhalation. The fire started on the <b>promenade</b> <b>deck</b> and was started by a cutting torch. Damage was estimated at $2 million ($ today).|$|E
25|$|As night {{approached}} the hijackers {{took all the}} hostages up several decks to the Arazzi Lounge on the <b>Promenade</b> <b>deck</b> and gave them blankets to spend the night. While they ordered the ship's kitchen to send food up for the hostages, they placed containers they claimed were filled with gasoline around the room (apparently as a bluff {{to ward off the}} ship's crew). Despite fears of grenades and gasoline, the passengers attempted to sleep on the floor while the ship steamed towards Syria.|$|E
2500|$|A {{reception}} {{area for the}} restaurant was added in the foyer of the B-Deck aft Grand Staircase on Titanic, which did not exist on Olympic, and the main reception room on D-Deck was also slightly enlarged. [...] private <b>promenade</b> <b>decks</b> {{were added to the}} two luxury parlour suites on B-Deck on Titanic, as well as additional First-Class gangway entrances on B-Deck. Cosmetic differences also existed between the two ships, most noticeably concerning the wider use of Axminster carpeting in Titanics public rooms, as opposed to the more durable linoleum flooring on Olympic.|$|R
2500|$|Additionally, the B-Deck First-Class <b>promenade</b> <b>decks</b> {{installed}} on Olympic had {{proven to be}} scarcely used because of the already ample promenade space on A-Deck. Accordingly Thomas Andrews eliminated this feature on Titanic and built additional, enlarged staterooms with en-suite bathrooms. It also allowed a Café Parisien {{in the style of}} a French sidewalk café to be added as an annex to the À la Carte Restaurant, and for the Restaurant itself to be expanded to the Port-side of the ship. One drawback of this was that the Second-Class promenade space on B-Deck was reduced aboard Titanic.|$|R

It was evident that the father of Miss Moorsom wished him to remain lost. Perhaps the unprecedented heat of the season made him long for the cool spaces of the Pacific, the sweep of the ocean’s free wind along the <b>promenade</b> <b>decks,</b> cumbered with long chairs, of a ship steaming towards the Californian coast. To Renouard the philosopher appeared simply the most treacherous of fathers. He was amazed. But he {{was not at the}} end of his discoveries.|$|R
