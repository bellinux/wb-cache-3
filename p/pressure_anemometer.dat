He is also credited {{with the development of}} a <b>pressure</b> <b>anemometer</b> (1883) and making improvements in regards to rain gauge methodology. In 1883, with chemist Hans Heinrich Landolt, he published the first edition of the Physikalisch-Chemische Tabellen (now referred to as the [...] "Landolt-Börnstein"; it presently contains more than 400 volumes of data from all areas of the physical sciences).|$|E
40|$|The Shionomisaki Wind Observatory of Disaster Prevention Research Institute of KyotoUniversity was {{established}} in 1961 to study mechanism of wind disasters on structureswith actual constructions in natural winds. To obtain full knowledge of natural windstructures, which act on the constructions as external forces, various kinds of anemometersare used or under development in this observatory. They are an all-weather type bivane,pressure plate and <b>pressure</b> tube <b>anemometers</b> with high frequency resolution, a sonicanemometer, a portable anemometerand so forth. In this paper, brief noteson these anemometers are presented...|$|R
50|$|The {{successful}} metal <b>pressure</b> tube <b>anemometer</b> of William Henry Dines in 1892 {{utilized the}} same pressure {{difference between the}} open mouth of a straight tube facing the wind and a ring of small holes in a vertical tube which is closed at the upper end. Both are mounted at the same height. The pressure differences on which the action depends are very small, and special means are required to register them. The recorder consists of a float in a sealed chamber partially filled with water. The pipe from the straight tube {{is connected to the}} top of the sealed chamber and the pipe from the small tubes is directed into the bottom inside the float. Since the pressure difference determines the vertical position of the float this is a measure of the wind speed.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the speed}} of sound varies with temperature, and is {{virtually}} stable with <b>pressure</b> change, ultrasonic <b>anemometers</b> are also used as thermometers.Two-dimensional (wind speed and wind direction) sonic anemometers are used in applications such as weather stations, ship navigation, aviation, weather buoys and wind turbines. Monitoring wind turbines usually requires a refresh rate of wind speed measurements of 3 Hz, easily achieved by sonic anemometers. Three-dimensional sonic anemometers are widely used to measure gas emissions and ecosystem fluxes using the eddy covariance method when used with fast-response infrared gas analyzers or laser-based analyzers.|$|R
50|$|The TOtable TOrnado Observatory (TOTO), {{developed}} by NOAA Environmental Research Laboratory scientists, was a 55-gallon barrel outfitted with <b>anemometers,</b> <b>pressure</b> sensors, and humidity sensors, along with devices {{to record the}} data. In theory, a team would roll TOTO {{out of the back}} of the pickup in the path of a tornado, switch on the instruments, and get out of the way. Several groups tried to deploy TOTO over the years, but never scored a direct hit. The closest TOTO ever came to success was in 1984 when it was sideswiped by the edge of a weak tornado and was knocked over. TOTO was retired in 1987.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} drivers for this project is the {{requirement}} to complement other high-quality surface data-sets with surface wind data for use in climate change detection and attribution studies. The high-quality data may {{also be used to}} analyse trends in storminess. Investigations highlighted the following three issues: Over the last two decades Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) have been installed at a large number of locations over the Australian region. The majority of newly installed wind instruments are rotating cup anemometers (Synchrotac), in many cases replacing older types, such as <b>pressure</b> tube <b>anemometers</b> (Dines). The corresponding changes in instrumentation alone can significantly change the characteristics of observed wind speed. Daylight Saving Time (DST) is in effect in the majority of Australian States, typically for a period from late October to late March. During this period, observations are taken according to DST rather than Local Standard Time (LST). Observations taken one hour earlier (compared with LST) can significantly affect the measured wind speed relative to climatology at a particular time. Estimates of daily mean wind speed depend on the frequency of synoptic observations. The frequency of these observations typically increases towards {{the latter part of the}} record, in some cases from two observations (at 0900 and 1500) to eight observations a day (at three-hourly intervals). Depending on the number of synoptic observations used to derive the daily mean wind speed, the true value may be significantly over- or underestimated...|$|R
40|$|The Dines <b>pressure</b> tube <b>anemometer</b> was {{the primary}} wind speed {{recording}} instrument used in Australia until it was replaced by Synchrotac cup anemometers in the 1990 s. Simultaneous observations of the gust wind speeds recorded using both types of anemometers during tropical cyclones have, however, {{raised questions about the}} equivalency of the gust wind speeds recorded using the two instruments. An experimental study of the response of both versions of the Dines anemometer used in Australia shows that the response of the anemometer is dominated by the motion of the float manometer used to record the wind speed. The amplitude response function shows the presence of two resonant peaks, with the amplitude and frequency of the peaks depending on the instrument version and the mean wind speed. Comparison of the gust wind speeds recorded using Dines and Synchrotac anemometers using random process and linear system theory shows that, on average, the low-speed Dines anemometer records values 2 %– 5 % higher than those recorded using a Synchrotac anemometer under the same conditions, while the high-speed Dines anemometer records values 3 %– 7 % higher, depending on the mean wind speed and turbulence intensity. These differences are exacerbated with the adoption of the WMO-recommended 3 -s moving average gust wind speed when reporting the Synchrotac anemometer gust wind speeds, rising to 6 %– 12 % and 11 %– 19 % for low- and high-speed Dines anemometers, respectively. These results are consistent with both field observations and an independent extreme value analysis of simultaneously observed gust wind speeds at seven sites in northern Australia...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the design, calibration, and performance {{evaluation of a}} type of two-hole <b>pressure</b> probe <b>anemometer</b> known as a Conrad probe, {{as well as its}} subsequent implementation on an autonomous, compact boundary layer measurement device and its first application for subsonic in-flight measurements of a swept wing boundary layer. Calibration of the Conrad probe was accomplished using two calibration functions and a non-nulling method for resolving in-plane flow velocity direction and magnitude over a range of ± 30 degrees. This approach to calibration and application offered the advantages of rapid data acquisition with lower energy consumption than alternative methods for pressure probe anemometry in swept wing boundary layers. Following calibration, the probe was adapted for use on an autonomous boundary layer measurement device including development of revised software. Utilizing this setup, boundary layer measurements were obtained on both swept and unswept models in a wind tunnel with a maximum operational velocity of 110 mph corresponding to a dynamic pressure of 30 psf. The wind tunnel results showed that the Conrad probe could measure in-plane flow magnitude for both laminar and turbulent boundary layers with sufficient uncertainty and spatial resolution for its intended application in flight testing. The Conrad probe and boundary layer measurement system were then employed for flight tests of a 30 degree swept wing model carried beneath an aircraft at a flight Mach number of 0. 52 and altitudes up to 44, 000 ft. The flight test results from the Conrad probe allowed for the successful determination of overall boundary layer thickness, laminar/turbulent conditions, and degree of flow turning within the boundary layer. It is believed that the rapid data acquisition and low energy consumption of the Conrad probe implementation on the boundary layer measurement system make it a good alternative for future flight testing requiring measurements of in-plane flow velocity magnitude and direction...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study of wind energy and momentum input into finite-depth wind waves was undertaken at Lake George, New South Wales, Australia. To measure microscale oscillations of induced pressure above surface waves, a high-precision wave-follower system was developed at the University of Miami, Florida. The principal sensing hardware included Elliott <b>pressure</b> probes, hot-film <b>anemometers,</b> and Pitot tubes. The wave-follower recordings were supplemented by {{a complete set of}} relevant measurements in the atmospheric boundary layer, on the surface, and in the water body. This paper is dedicated to technical aspects of the measurement procedure and data analysis. The precision of the feedback wave-following mechanism did not impose any restrictions on the measurement accuracy in the range of wave heights and frequencies relevant to the problem. Thorough calibrations of the pressure transducers and moving Elliott probes were conducted. It is shown that the response of the air column in the connecting tubes provides a frequency-dependent phase shift, which must be accounted for to recover the low-level induced pressure signal. In the finite-depth environment of Lake George, breaking waves {{play an important role in}} the momentum exchange between wind and waves, as will be shown in a subsequent paper...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Sound {{attenuation}} {{is done by}} active {{sound attenuator}} or by passive sound attenuator. In case of active sound attenuation the anti-noise source is used to reduce the intensity of noise however, in passive sound attenuation various types of sound absorbing porous materials are used to absorb sound energy. In passive sound attenuators the {{substantial portion of the}} mechanical pressure wave penetrates to the pores before encountering to the solid surface. Large number of interactions takes place and the energy is transferred to the solid structure through the frictional losses and the sound intensity is reduced. Passive sound attenuator is used in Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) duct to reduce the sound produced by the blower. Two porous materials of different sound absorbing coefficients are used in the attenuator. This passive attenuator is specifically designed to study the effect at low sound frequency. Frequency of sound is measured with the help of Lab VIEW software. Intensity of sound is measured using digital decibel (dB) meter. To measure the <b>pressure</b> drop digital <b>anemometer</b> is used. Along with the combination of porous materials the effect of thickness of porous absorber and the angle of porous absorbers with the direction of air stream is studied...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} better {{understand}} the dynamics of fire-atmosphere interactions and the role of micrometeorology on fire behaviour the FireFlux campaign was conducted in 2006 on a coastal tall-grass prairie in southeast Texas, USA. The FireFlux campaign dataset has become the international standard for evaluating coupled fire-atmosphere model systems. While FireFlux {{is one of the most}} comprehensive field campaigns to date, the dataset does have some major limitations especially the lack of sufficient measurements of fire spread and fire behaviour properties. In order to overcome this, a new, more comprehensive field experiment, called FireFlux II, was conducted on 30 January 2013. This paper will address the experimental design and preliminary results. The experiment was designed to allow an intense head fire to burn directly through an extensive instrumentation array including fixed 42 -m and three 10 -m micrometeorological towers (Figure 2). The fuels consist of a mixture of native grasses. Each tower was equipped with a variety of sensors, including 3 D sonic <b>anemometers,</b> <b>pressure</b> sensors, heat flux radiometers, and an array of fine-wire thermocouples to measure plume temperatures. The experiment was carried out under red flag warning conditions with strong winds of 8 m s- 1 and relative humidity of approximately 24 %. Instrumentation also included a scanning Doppler wind lidar, microwave temperatur...|$|R
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{was part of}} the session : Poster SessionsSixth International Planetary Probe WorkshopThe polar regions of Mars offer a rich environment to search for signs of life. The Atromos probe was designed with the intent of investigating this polar region for evidence of life and to take atmospheric data in the harsh environment. The overall project was done as an example model and proof of concept for a small and affordable planetary probe capable of collecting scientific data used in life detection. Several key instruments were included such as a mass spectrometer, methane detector, gas chromatograph, and atmospheric characterization equipment. Some important components of the design were the ultra sonic drill, mechanical airbag system and deployable mast. The ultra sonic drill consists of a piezoelectric vibrator attached to a coring bit and a free mass. This drill can operate without external force applied and can bring back ice cores on the polar surface. The mechanical airbag system is an alternative method for touchdown in the EDL sequence. It minimizes the complexity and increases reliability of the probe surviving impact by utilizing spokes to absorb the impact. The deployable mast is used to enhance the atmospheric data collection by extending a series of temperature, <b>pressure</b> and <b>anemometers</b> to various distances above the surface. Notable subsystem work includes the power system and thermal regulation for operation on the planet. The power system consists of a radioisotope thermoelectric generator as well as solar panels that surround the probe. Power is stored in ultra capacitors and the probe operates on duty cycles when enough power is stored. The thermal regulation system consists of a sealed insulated box concealed within the probe. Inside the box are several radioisotope heating units to provide the warmth necessary for polar survival. System design, integration, testing and mock construction were performed on the various subsystems to determine feasibility and effectiveness. poster will be presented at the IPPW 6. The poster will show the system layout, integration and testing results for all the subsystems and equipment included on the probe. A mock model will accompany the poster to help visualize the scale and functionality of the probe. NASA, Ames Research Cente...|$|R
