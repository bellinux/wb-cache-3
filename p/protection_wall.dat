40|$|This {{research}} {{attempts to}} make {{a better understanding of the}} ancient city wall and to study the Chinese <b>walls</b> <b>protection</b> theory. Then, based on the research of status quo, practical experience and lessons of <b>walls</b> <b>protection</b> in China, the thesis tries to establish a series of principles, methods,strategies and a better system for Chinese ancient city <b>wall's</b> <b>protection,</b> which has realistic meaning for guiding and promoting city <b>wall</b> <b>protection</b> work of China in future. China's city wall construction has a very long history. There are thousands of different sizes city walls of the Ming and Qing Dynasties in China, which is unique in world's history. With increasing urbanization and enhanced awareness of historic preservation, the protection of ancient city wall is getting more attention, but the specific conservation practice in China also has a lot of problems, such as how to graft these ancient elements onto the modern society through city walls conservation. Present research focus on the contradictions between city <b>walls</b> <b>protection</b> and urban construction. The research firstly combed the origins and the development process of the ancient city wall in China, analyzed and summarized the type, the composition system, construction materials, technologies and the affective factors of walls, established research platform of the background systematically. Then the research studied the theoretical basis of the walls conservation of China and Europe from the relevant laws, regulations and cultural relic preservation concepts. The review of Chinese ancient city <b>wall</b> <b>protection</b> history which is from the remove to <b>protection</b> of the <b>walls</b> was based on the specific historic background of China. The research classified today's existing ancient city walls into two main types: Relatively complete walls which includes relatively complete city walls exist in metropolis, relatively complete city walls exist in medium and small-sized cities and partially preserved walls. According to the types, the research selected seven Chinese cities to investigate the status quo of the city <b>walls</b> <b>protection,</b> which are Nanjing and Xi'an relatively complete city walls exist in metropolis; Pingyao, Jingzhou, Shouxian and Xingcheng which are relatively complete city walls exist in medium and small cities; Beijing which is partially preserved walls. Then, the research also studied the city <b>wall</b> <b>protection</b> system in China from the laws and regulations, protection mechanisms and urban planning system. Through analyzing the status quo of the main types of walls and the city <b>wall</b> <b>protection</b> system in China, existing problems in the <b>walls</b> <b>protection</b> can be summarized. Meanwhile the reasons causing these issues can also be found. According to the problems of city <b>walls</b> <b>protection</b> in China, this thesis proposed general protection principles which should be emphasized in the city <b>wall</b> <b>protection</b> of China. They are authenticity principle, systematic principle and sustainability principle. Based on the tree principles, the research introduced the concept of dynamic integrated conservation which includes the <b>walls</b> <b>protection</b> planning, body maintenance and environmental renovation and explored the specific conservation methods. The research also summarizes the strategies to support the <b>walls</b> <b>protection</b> all over China, proposed a sound legal system, pluralistic financing mechanism and flexible incentives. However, without an effective city <b>wall</b> <b>protection</b> system the above outcomes cannot be implemented in the protection process. So the thesis established a suggested system which was composed by two parts: First is the supporting mechanism which is directly under the administration of central government through formulating the protection legislation, developing financing policies and controlling anthropogenic factors to support the city <b>wall</b> <b>protection</b> work all over China. Second part is the core of the system, the implementation mechanism. An Authoritative Institution composed of multi - disciplinary experts who were selected by the central government should be established to guide and manage the protection work under the local levels' support. According to the central level's requirements combined with the local situation the Authoritative Institution make an integrated plan of the city <b>wall</b> <b>protection</b> and take charge of implementing the plan of the walls body preservation and surrounding setting renovation. The research found the main problems of Chinese city <b>wall</b> <b>protection</b> and attempted to solve these problems by proposing protection principles and establishing a suggested protection system. However, city <b>wall</b> <b>protection</b> is a long term work the outcomes of the research need long time test to identify its feasibility and new problems in order to draw better <b>wall</b> <b>protection</b> system in futur...|$|R

40|$|Coastal lagoons are low-lying systems under {{permanent}} changes {{motivated by}} natural and anthropogenic factors. Ria de Aveiro {{is such an}} example with its margins currently threatened by the advance of the lagoonal waters recorded during the last decades. This work aims to study the tidal modifications found between 1987 and 2012 in this lagoon, motivated by the main channels deepening which induce higher inland tidal levels. Additionally it aims to study the impact that protective walls {{designed to protect the}} margins against flooding may have in those modifications under sea level rise predictions. The hydrodynamic model ELCIRC previously calibrated for Ria de Aveiro was used and tidal asymmetry, tidal ellipses and residual currents were analyzed for different scenarios, considering the mean sea level rise predicted for 2100 and the implementation of probable flood <b>protection</b> <b>walls.</b> Results evidenced that lagoon dominance remained unchanged between 1987 and 2012, but distortion decreased/increased in the deeper/shallower channels. The same trend was found under mean sea level rise conditions. Tidal currents increased over this period inducing an amplification of the water properties exchange within the lagoon, which will be stronger under mean sea level rise conditions. The deviations between scenarios with or without flood <b>protection</b> <b>walls</b> can achieve 60 % for the tidal distortion and residual currents and 20 % for the tidal currents, highlighting that tidal properties are extremely sensitive to the lagoon geometry. In summary, the development of numerical modelling applications dedicated to study the influence of mean sea level rise on coastal low-lying systems subjected to human influence should include structural measures designed for flood defence in order to accurately predict changes in the local tidal properties...|$|R
40|$|Recommendations for {{dimensioning}} of {{pile foundations}} for noise <b>protection</b> <b>walls</b> in embankments were proposed. This report combines findings {{from various sources}} and offers a semi-empirical dimensioning process. In a study of literature, model tests, large-scale tests, dimensioning methods based on test loads and various theoretical models were analysed. Furthermore, a few model tests were carried out to verify the kinematics. The safety concept accordingto the new DIN 1054 (draft of 14 / 08 / 92) was taken into consideration. Subsequently a dimensioning method was proposed and checked {{by means of a}} data bank established within the framework of this study. The proposed dimensioning method is based on a bearing capacity corresponding to the ultimate limit state of construction parts. It was established that the serviceability limit state can be covered with the partial safety coefficients and with a load increase factor by means of the verification of the bearing capacity so that the permanent tilting after 10. 000 load cycles is smaller than 1 %. Verification of overall stability is not necessary according to a simple comparative analysis by Vogt. The proposed dimensioning process was described in the following chapters: application limits, soil parameters, verification of bearing capacity, verification of serviceability, procedure in dimensioning, calculation examples. Some recommendations on the design of noise <b>protection</b> <b>walls</b> and a proposal of wind load assumption were also presented.
