5|$|Guðrøðr Magnússon (fl. 1275), {{also known}} as Godred Magnusson, was an illegitimate son of Magnús Óláfsson, King of Mann and the Isles. In 1275, whilst Mann was under Scottish overlordship, Guðrøðr led an {{unsuccessful}} revolt on the island. According to a near contemporary source, over five hundred <b>people</b> <b>lost</b> <b>their</b> lives in the subsequent Scottish invasion and suppression of the Manx.

5|$|On July 9, 551, the Phoenician {{coastal cities}} were devastated by a high-magnitude {{earthquake}}. In Beirut the earthquake {{was followed by}} a tsunami and a fire that obliterated the city. In the aftermath, 30,000 <b>people</b> <b>lost</b> <b>their</b> lives, including many students from abroad. Justinian allocated funds to rebuild Beirut, and the law school was temporarily moved to the southern Phoenician city of Sidon, pending reconstruction; the best teachers, however, moved to Constantinople. Misfortune hit Beirut again in 560 when a massive fire ravaged the recovering city. The law school was not reopened, and all prospect for its return was abandoned with the Arab conquest in 635.|$|E
5|$|Passing {{through the}} Ryukyu Islands as a {{powerful}} typhoon, Babe caused considerable damage in the region. More than 1,000 homes were destroyed and nearly 7,000 more were damaged or flooded. One person was killed on Amami Ōshima and 77 others were injured throughout the country. Total losses reached ¥6.1 billion (US$23 million). Offshore, over 100 vessels were affected by the storm, including a Panamanian freighter where 13 <b>people</b> <b>lost</b> <b>their</b> lives. In China, more than 24,000 homes were destroyed and nine people were killed.|$|E
5|$|The McLaughlin Planetarium {{was closed}} on November 5, 1995. The {{president}} of the ROM stated that {{the closure of the}} planetarium was due to a combination of falling attendance and a declining interest in space, and that the closure was necessitated by provincial budget cuts. The decision came as a surprise to many, as attendance had rebounded in recent years, and the planetarium was one of few in North America at the time that was turning a profit. The closure meant that 40 <b>people</b> <b>lost</b> <b>their</b> jobs.|$|E

In Williston, nearly a dozen residences were destroyed, killing {{at least one person}} and injuring 15 more. Six prison inmates were killed by a falling tree on a farm near the town, and in total, about 13 <b>people</b> <b>lost</b> <b>their</b> lives in mainland Levy County. Damage throughout the county, including the Cedar Keys, was estimated at $450,000.|$|E
5|$|Salford Docks (also called Manchester Docks) {{were opened}} by Queen Victoria in 1894, {{providing}} docks in Manchester and Salford for the Manchester Ship Canal which linked Manchester to the sea. During the 1970s, the docks fell into decline as they proved {{too small for}} new, larger ships, {{and when they were}} abandoned in 1982 over 3,000 <b>people</b> <b>lost</b> <b>their</b> jobs. Salford City Council purchased the docks in 1984 and since then they underwent regeneration as a centre of tourism in Salford, which included the construction of the Lowry Centre. More than 10,000 people are employed in the Quays in jobs such as retail, construction, and e-commerce. In 2007, it was confirmed that the BBC would be moving five of its departments to a new development on Pier 9 of Salford Quays, to be called MediaCityUK. The move, which is expected to be completed by 2011, will create up to 15,500 jobs and add £1bn to the regional economy over 5 years.|$|E
5|$|The 1941 Texas {{hurricane}}, {{the second}} storm of the 1941 Atlantic hurricane season, {{was a large}} and intense tropical cyclone that struck coastal Texas as a major hurricane in September 1941, causing relatively severe damage. The storm is estimated to have formed in the eastern Gulf of Mexico on September16. After attaining hurricane strength, it completed a clockwise loop and turned northwestward. The hurricane continued to strengthen until it made landfall near East Matagorda Bay, Texas, with winds of , but rapidly weakened as it headed inland. Damage from the storm amounted to about $6.5 million, and crops throughout the region were largely destroyed. The city of Houston suffered extensive damage as the storm passed to the east. The hurricane disrupted activities related to the Louisiana Maneuvers. Later, the system became extratropical and passed over Lake Huron, killing three people in Toronto. Overall, seven <b>people</b> <b>lost</b> <b>their</b> lives due to the cyclone.|$|E

5000|$|In Russian {{language}} and culture, [...] "former people" [...] (Бывшие люди) are <b>people</b> who <b>lost</b> <b>their</b> social status, an expression somewhat {{similar to the}} English one, [...] "". The expression went into a wide circulation in the Russian Empire after the 1897 short story of Maxim Gorky, Бывшие люди, translated in English as Creatures That Once Were Men, about people fallen from prosperity into an abyss of misery. After the October Revolution the expression referred to <b>people</b> who <b>lost</b> <b>their</b> social status after the revolution: aristocracy, imperial military, bureaucracy, clergy, etc.|$|R
5|$|Occurring {{just two}} months after Cyclone Paula {{affected}} Vanuatu, Sose compounded the damage already done by the previous storm, especially to crops and farmlands. Throughout the island chain, two <b>people</b> <b>lost</b> <b>their</b> lives to the storm. Roadways were blocked by debris and floodwaters, while schools and classrooms on several islands were damaged or ruined. The storm destroyed about 200 homes around the nation and damaged many more, particularly on southern Espiritu Santo. The storm's large fetch generated enormous swells {{as far away as}} Australia's Eastern Seaboard, where surfers took advantage of the abnormally intense conditions and two swimmers drowned. On Maré Island in New Caledonia, a man was swept away by a large wave and presumed dead. The storm later produced torrential rainfall and strong winds over the North Island of New Zealand, sparking damaging freshwater floods and downing trees and power lines. Hazardous driving conditions in the Waikato region led to a fatal traffic accident in which three people died. Another individual drowned in a swollen river. Sose reportedly contributed to coastal flooding as far away as Tonga. In all, Sose killed nine people; total monetary damage is unknown. As a result of the storm's destruction, its name was later retired.|$|E
5|$|Following protests {{during the}} {{movement}} in which 105 <b>people</b> <b>lost</b> <b>their</b> lives in clashes with the police, Bombay State was reorganised on linguistic lines on 1 May 1960. Gujarati-speaking areas of Bombay State were partitioned into the state of Gujarat. Maharashtra State with Bombay as its capital was formed with the merger of Marathi-speaking areas of Bombay State, eight districts from Central Provinces and Berar, five districts from Hyderabad State, and numerous princely states enclosed between them. As a memorial to the martyrs of the Samyukta Maharashtra movement, Flora Fountain was renamed as Hutatma Chowk (Martyr's Square), and a memorial was erected. The following decades saw massive expansion {{of the city and}} its suburbs. In the late 1960s, Nariman Point and Cuffe Parade were reclaimed and developed. The Bombay Metropolitan Region Development Authority (BMRDA) was established on 26 January 1975 by the Government of Maharashtra as an apex body for planning and co-ordination of development activities in the Bombay metropolitan region. In August 1979, a sister township of New Bombay was founded by the City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) across the Thane and Raigad districts to help the dispersal and control of Bombay's population. The textile industry in Bombay largely disappeared after the widespread 1982 Great Bombay Textile Strike, in which nearly 250,000 workers in more than 50 textile mills went on strike. Mumbai's defunct cotton mills have since become the focus of intense redevelopment.|$|E
5|$|On {{its first}} landfall, the {{tropical}} storm buffeted the eastern-central Philippines with damaging winds gusting up to 160km/h (100mph), heavy rainfall, and rough seas. At least 20 provinces experienced adverse or dangerous weather, {{with the worst}} conditions concentrated over the islands of Samar and Masbate. While structural and crop damages were limited, local infrastructure and transportation suffered the greatest. Nepartak's winds caused complete power outages on Samar, Masbate, and nearby Marinduque, affecting their entire collective population of nearly four million individuals. Many schools were closed. The storm forced the cancellation of nearly two dozen domestic flights {{to and from the}} region, and at least 120 ferries and other vessels sought shelter in ports around the Manila, Bicol, and Visayas regions. On those ships were more than 5,000 people who became stranded until safe passage could be made. By November 15, five deaths had been confirmed in the Philippines, four the result of electrocutions from downed powerlines. Immediately following the disaster, then-President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo made assisting the stranded passengers in coastal ports a priority. According to the PAGASA in its post-storm report, a total of 13 <b>people</b> <b>lost</b> <b>their</b> lives, 5 others remained unaccounted for, and 11 sustained injuries. One newspaper reported that a motorized craft in the Tañon Strait capsized {{at the height of the}} storm, forcing the rescue of 11 people. Another source also describes the sinking of a boat with at least 13 survivors and one fatality. It is not clear whether these accounts cover the same incident.|$|E

5|$|Within a {{few days}} after the {{hurricane}} passed, the Grenada Emergency Operations Center temporarily prevented relief supplies from entering the country to ensure the safety of the incoming items; the decision was reversed shortly thereafter, and planes flew supplies during daylight hours into the reopened airport. Severe looting occurred in the immediate aftermath of Ivan, prompting police officials to enact a curfew for the night hours. In the first week following the hurricane, aid was slow to the affected residents, due to the lack of an efficient aid distribution system. 30official shelters and 17prepared ones housed over 5,000people in the aftermath of the storm. Thousands of <b>people</b> <b>lost</b> <b>their</b> jobs due to the hurricane, with all businesses shut down following the hurricane. By two months after the hurricane struck, 65schools were opened, some of which serving as shelters; water and power were gradually restored to the island. By a year after the storm's passage, all schools were reopened, and most buildings enacted provisional repairs. Officials determined around 10,000houses on the island required complete reconstruction, while a further 22,000 needed repairs. The government of Grenada initially planned to rebuild 1,000houses in the year after the hurricane struck; by June 2005, 260families were provided houses, with a further 85under construction. The government also established a Material Assistance Programme, which provided $5,000 (2004XCD) of free materials to more than 5,000families, as well as a total of $4.3million (2004XCD) in low interest loans to 148families. Several indirect fatalities occurred in the aftermath of the hurricane, primarily senior citizens.|$|E
