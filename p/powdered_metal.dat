5|$|Lacquerware is {{produced}} in a three-step process: first the base is prepared. Most often the base consists of wood, {{but it can also}} be of paper or leather. Next is the application of lacquer, which hardens while drying, thereby sealing the base. Generally several layers of lacquer are applied. The lacquer is then decorated with a variety of methods. In the maki-e technique, a <b>powdered</b> <b>metal</b> (usually gold or silver) is sprinkled on the lacquer before completely hardened. This technique was developed and popular in the Heian period but continued to be used with refinements into the early modern period. Over the next centuries various other methods that employ precious metals were developed, such as the ikakeji technique originating in the Kamakura period in which a finely ground gold powder was spread in sufficient quantities to mimic solid gold. The use of metallic powders was complemented with other techniques such as polished shell inlay or gold leaf (kirikane). The former was used in the Heian and Kamakura periods and popular motifs included water, rocks, trees or flowers. Starting in the Kamakura period, larger and more solid objects such as toiletry chests were decorated with realistic images. Towards the end of the medieval period (late-16th century), simpler designs were favoured in decorations. Honami Kōetsu who lived around this time is the earliest lacquer artist known by name.|$|E

Instead of requiring the input oxide and output metal to be in liquid form, tantalum electrolysis operates on non-liquid powdered oxides.

50|$|Friction stir {{processing}} {{can also}} be used to improve the microstructural properties of <b>powder</b> <b>metal</b> objects.

While conventional techniques for removing this film include forging and extrusion, friction stir processing is suited for situations where localized treatment is desired.|$|R
40|$|<b>Powder</b> <b>metals</b> are {{becoming}} a popular choice in the automotive and other manufacturing industries because {{of their ability to}} meet wide ranging product functional requirements without compromising the performance of the product. They offer various advantages, including weight reduction, near net-shape processing capability, and their ability to be sintered to achieve desired properties in the end-product. However, in order to satisfy the product design requirements during manufacturing, they need to be machined to the required tolerances. Machining of <b>powder</b> <b>metals</b> is quite different to machining of traditional metals because of their specific properties, including porosity. This thesis work deals with the finish machining of <b>powder</b> <b>metal</b> steels in automotive applications, for increased tool-life/reduced tool-wear. Tool-life is affected by a variety of factors such as tool grade selection, tool coating, cutting conditions and tool geometry including cutting edge geometry. This work involves optimization of cutting conditions for plunge cutting and boring operations of automotive <b>powder</b> <b>metal</b> components using PCBN and carbide tools. The cycle time of the process introduces an additional constraint for the optimization model along with the tool-wear criterion. Optimized cuttin...|$|R
