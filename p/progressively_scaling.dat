Large performance gains are realized {{by reducing the}} number of convolution operations, and optimizing the evaluation of those that remain. We achieve this by decomposing the overall scale transformation into a cascade of smaller scale operations. As an image is <b>progressively</b> <b>scaled</b> towards the desired resolution, a multi-stage filter with kernels of varying size is applied.

Furthermore, by constraining the manner in which the transformation is decomposed, we are able to derive optimal kernels and implement efficient convolvers. The convolvers are optimized in the sense that they require no multiplication; only lookup table and addition operations are necessary. This accelerates convolution and greatly extends the range of filters that may be feasibly applied for image scaling. The algorithm readily lends itself to efficient soft [...] ...|$|R

In this paper, we report a surprising gradual {{transition from}} meiosis to mitosis over the first eight divisions of the mouse embryo. The first cleavages still largely share the mechanism of spindle formation with meiosis, during which the spindle is self-assembled from randomly distributed microtubule-organizing centers (MTOCs) without centrioles, because of the concerted activity of dynein and kinesin- 5. During preimplantation development, the number of cellular MTOCs progressively decreased, the spindle pole gradually became more focused, and spindle length <b>progressively</b> <b>scaled</b> down with cell size. The typical mitotic spindle with centrin-, odf 2 -, kinesin- 12 –, and CP 110 -positive centrosomes was established only in the blastocyst.

As the fortification of the Maubeuge Front was commenced later than the main section of the Line to the east, funds were restricted by the impact of the Great Depression, which had reached France. A relatively ambitious project was nevertheless advanced, planning for five artillery ouvrages [...] (Eth, Bavai, Quatre-Bras, L'Épine and Boussois) between Valenciennes and the Ardennes.

The plan was also affected by political considerations, in which the fortification of the Belgian frontier was seen as a betrayal of the French plan for forward defense on Belgian territory.
