5|$|A <b>prototype</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{automatic}} strobe {{unit was}} produced in October, along with a new Mk. IVA-like radar unit with a manual strobe for testing. EMI was then asked to provide another breadboard <b>prototype</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strobe unit for air testing, which was delivered on 12 October. A raft of problems were found and addressed. Among these, {{it was found that}} the strobe would often stick to the ground reflection, and when it did not, would not stick until it had a strong signal at shorter ranges, or might stick to the wrong target. Eventually a panacea button was added to unstick the strobe in these cases.|$|E
5|$|After {{his initial}} <b>prototype</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> late 1860s, Roper {{built a new}} and revised version in 1884, based on the then {{state of the art}} safety bicycle frame type. Sylvester Roper died of an {{apparent}} heart attack while riding this machine in 1896.|$|E

5|$|After the metre was redefined in 1960, the {{kilogram}} {{remained the}} only SI base unit that {{relied on a}} specific physical artefact, the international <b>prototype</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kilogram (IPK), for its definition and thus the only unit that was still subject to periodic comparisons of national standard kilograms with the IPK. After the 1996–1998 recalibration, a clear divergence between the various prototype kilograms was observed.|$|E
5|$|However, Chase had {{designed}} the aircraft {{to allow for}} the easy installation of engines; the first XG-20 had already been modified with two radial piston engines, becoming the XC-123, the <b>prototype</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> long-serving C-123 Provider family of transports. Meanwhile, the second prototype XG-20 was returned to Chase Aircraft, to be fitted with two twin pods for General Electric J47 turbojets, becoming the XC-123A, the first jet-powered transport aircraft built in the United States.|$|E

5|$|It succeeded the GameCube, {{and early}} models are fully backward-compatible with all GameCube games and most accessories. Nintendo first {{spoke of the}} console at the E3 2004 press conference and later {{unveiled}} it at E3 2005. Nintendo CEO Satoru Iwata revealed a <b>prototype</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> controller at the September 2005 Tokyo Game Show. At E3 2006, the console won {{the first of several}} awards. By December 8, 2006, it had completed its launch in the four key markets.|$|E
5|$|Since the T65 {{project was}} fading away, the Armored Force still needed a light {{anti-aircraft}} vehicle, so {{they made a}} new project (called T65E1) based on the new T24 chassis (a <b>prototype</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> M24 Chaffee). The T65E1 had the same overall layout as the T65 GMC – gun turret at rear with the engines {{in the middle of}} the chassis – with a few minor tweaks (including an angular gun shield instead of a straight one).|$|E
5|$|The Do 17L-0 and Do 17M-0 were {{developed}} in parallel as replacements for the earlier E and Fs, the L being the reconnaissance version. Both were designed around the more powerful DB 600A engines, delivering about 746kW (1,000hp). Two L and one M versions were built as prototypes, both with another MG 15 in the nose. The first <b>prototype</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> revised version, the Do 17M V1 (D-ABVD) was powered by two DB 600s, and demonstrated impressive performance, including a maximum speed of 425km/h (264mph).|$|E

5|$|The Polikarpov I-6 was a Soviet biplane fighter <b>prototype</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> late 1920s. It was {{designed}} with traditional wooden construction {{in comparison with}} the wood and steel tube construction Polikarpov I-5. Its development took longer than planned and the lead designer, Nikolai Polikarpov, was arrested for industrial sabotage, which only further delayed the project. Only two prototypes were built, as the I-5 was selected for production.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge is}} {{believed}} to be the first steel box girder bridge built in the United States, and is considered a <b>prototype</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cable-stayed bridge of which a very similar design by the Germans was completed, the Stroemsund Bridge in Sweden. Similar bridges include a timber-stayed bridge designed in Germany in 1784, the wrought-iron stayed Albert Bridge in London designed in 1873, and the Chow Chow Bridge in Grays Harbor County. The bridge was listed on the Washington Heritage Register on January 25, 2002.|$|E
5|$|The {{ultimate}} {{success of}} the pressurized water reactor, he wrote, was due less to any superior characteristics of water, but rather to the decision to power the <b>prototype</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mark I submarine thermal reactor with a pressurized version of the Materials Testing Reactor at Oak Ridge. Once pressurized water was established, other possibilities became too expensive to pursue, but Weinberg remained interested in other possibilities. According to Freeman Dyson, {{he was the only}} nuclear pioneer who supported the wide universe of reactor designs.|$|E

5|$|This {{magnificent}} {{and tragic}} satire criticizes the <b>prototype</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Latin American dictator {{who appeared in}} several places {{at the beginning of}} the century and has since reappeared, his existence being fostered by the mechanism of tyranny which, for the common man, makes every day a hell on earth. The passionate vigour with which Asturias evokes the terror and distrust which poisoned the social atmosphere of the time makes his work a challenge and an invaluable aesthetic gesture.|$|E
5|$|When Antarctica: Empire of the Penguin was {{announced}} in November 2011, Oceaneering had already developed a working <b>prototype</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ride vehicle. The first concept art for the attraction was released in April 2012: a circular ride vehicle, seating eight riders in two rows of four. On May 11, 2012 Oceaneering filed a patent application for the ride's technology. At the November 2012 IAAPA Attractions Expo, SeaWorld Orlando and Oceaneering International revealed the trackless, motion simulator-based ride vehicle to the public.|$|E
5|$|While Hawks was not {{sympathetic}} to feminism, he popularized the Hawksian woman archetype, a portrayal {{of women in}} more strong, less effeminate roles. Such an emphasis had never {{been done in the}} 1920s and therefore was seen to be a rarity and, according to Naomi Wise, has been cited as a <b>prototype</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> post-feminist movement. Another notable theme carried throughout his work included the relationship of morality and human interaction. In this sense he tended to portray more dramatic elements of a concept or a plot in a humorous way.|$|E
