5000|$|In the UK, a 3" [...] mini CD {{version of}} the single was issued, {{featuring}} the same three tracks as the main 12" [...] vinyl release.

In Japan, a 3" [...] CD featuring [...] "Sweet Lies" [...] and [...] "Want You More" [...] was issued with a snap <b>pack</b> picture <b>sleeve</b> including lyrics.

5000|$|Most hoppers hold about 200 paintballs, {{and many}} modern {{electropneumatic}} markers can empty a full hopper in 10 seconds of sustained fire. In woodsball, {{and especially in}} scenario paintball, a player may be away from a base at which they can reload {{for an extended period}} of time. In speedball, the necessity of suppressing fire requires a very large amount of paint for a single game or match. In both cases, a harness with pods allows a player to have a portable supply of paint, without weighing down his or her marker with an enormous hopper. Harnesses capable of carrying a tank in addition to pods are usually labeled with a +1 (e.g. A harness capable of carrying four pods and a tank would be labeled 4+1). In addition, newer harness design make use of collapsible [...] "expansion sleeves" [...] in between the [...] "main" [...] <b>sleeves.</b> <b>Packs</b> with expansion <b>sleeves</b> are generally labelled X+Y, for instance 4+5, and indicate the number of main sleeves followed by the number of expansion <b>sleeves.</b> Some <b>packs</b> have multiple [...] "tiers" [...] of expansions or extra sleeves in very different locations on the harness, and may be labelled 4+3+2 where the last number is the additional set of expansions.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the historical development of}} blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) farming in Tracadie Bay (Prince Edward Island, Canada) and relates the spacing of suspended sleeves (SS) on longlines to seston uptake. From 1990 to 2001, mussel biomass in Tracadie Bay increased {{by a factor}} of four (from 1137 to 4743  t). By 2001, seston uptake rates were approximately three-fold water renewal rates, and harvest yields (kg sleeve− 1) were significantly lower than in the early 1990 s. A one-year field experiment was carried out to determine whether a change in SS could restore harvest yields. We found that SS (10, 20, 40, 60, 80  cm) had no significant effect on the condition index of mussels. However, high SS positively affected shell growth and abundance for small seeds that were densely <b>packed</b> within <b>sleeves.</b> A complete husbandry shift toward high SS and high seeding densities (within sleeves) may enhance farm productivity (production per unit of effort) and curtail seston uptake at the bay scale...|$|R
50|$|Prior to this, 1D retail {{barcodes}} {{were used}} that only offered limited protection {{as they did}} not cover all packaging on products. 2D barcodes meant that lids, <b>sleeves,</b> <b>pack</b> could all be identified by a barcode scanner to check that the product is packaged and dated correctly. In 2009, Marks and Spencer introduced a code of practice for the labelling of products that stipulated an autocoding system must be used on every production line. In 2013, {{it was estimated that}} autocoding software protects over 1500 lines in the United Kingdom; the largest supplier is Olympus Automation, which protects 723 food production lines.|$|R
5000|$|In November 1968, {{the album}} Unfinished Music No. 1: Two Virgins was released. The album was {{distributed}} by Track in the UK and Tetragrammaton in the US after EMI refused {{to produce the}} cover or sleeve the record because of the cover photo, unless it was changed. EMI, however, pressed the record in Britain, while the album cover was printed by Technik. Apple got around the <b>sleeve</b> <b>packing</b> problem by hiring several Apple scruffs to package the album. Apple employee Jack Oliver had the Apple scruffs packing the record into sleeves [...] "in {{the basement of the}} old Apple shop".|$|R
