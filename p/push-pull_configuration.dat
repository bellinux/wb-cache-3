5|$|Government of Ontario Transit (later {{abbreviated}} as 'GO Transit') {{started as}} a three-year long experiment on May 23, 1967 running single-deck trains powered by diesel locomotives in <b>push-pull</b> <b>configuration</b> on a single rail line along Lake Ontario's shoreline. GO Train service ran throughout the day from Oakville to Pickering with limited rush hour train service to Hamilton. The experiment proved to be extremely popular; GO Transit carried its first million riders during its first four months, and averaged 15,000 per day soon after. This line, now divided as the Lakeshore East and Lakeshore West lines is the keystone corridor of GO Transit. Expansion of rail service continued in the 1970s and 1980s, aimed at developing ridership in {{with the introduction of}} the Georgetown (now Kitchener) line in 1974 and the Richmond Hill line in 1978. The Milton GO Train line opened in 1981, followed by the Bradford (now Barrie) and Stouffville lines a year later, establishing the 7 rail corridors that today's rail service is based upon.|$|E

40|$|A 36 -dBm high-linearity {{single-ended}} common-source class-B monolithic-microwave integrated-circuit {{power amplifier}} is reported in GaN high electron-mobility transistor technology. We also describe {{the design and}} simulation of highly linear and highly efficient common-source and common-drain class-B power amplifiers. Single-ended class-B amplifiers with bandpass filtering have equivalent efficiency and linearity to <b>push-pull</b> <b>configurations.</b> The common-source class-B circuit demonstrates high linearity, greater than 35 dBc of third-order intermodulation (IM 3) suppression and high power-added efficiency (PAE) of 34 %. Simulations of common-drain class-B designs predict a PAE of 54 % with a superior IM 3 suppression of more than 45 dBc over {{a wider range of}} bias due to the strong series-series negative feedback offered by the load resistance...|$|R
25|$|The Thomas-Morse MB-4 was a {{prototype}} American mailplane of the 1920s. It was of unusual design, being a biplane with twin fuselages housing {{the crew of}} two and a central nacelle which carried the aircraft's twin engines in a <b>push-pull</b> <b>configuration.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Rail Runner power {{includes}} nine Motive Power MPI MP36PH-3C {{diesel-electric locomotives}} that operate on diesel fuel. The use of biodiesel fuel is under investigation. Passenger cars include thirteen Bombardier BiLevel Coaches and nine Bombardier BiLevel Cab cars. Coach cars have a seating capacity of 151 passengers while cab cars have a seating capacity of 141 passengers, with {{each type of}} car having standing room for an additional 60. Rail Runner trains operate in a <b>push-pull</b> <b>configuration,</b> with the locomotive always facing south. When not in use, the vehicles are stored in a railyard in Downtown Albuquerque, located across the main rail line from the Alvarado Transportation Center.|$|E
25|$|In September 1914, at {{the start}} of World War I, Ferdinand von Zeppelin visualised the concept of a Riesenflugzeug (R) bomber, to be larger than the then-nascent Friedel-Ursinus twin-engined {{military}} aircraft. Using engineers from the Robert Bosch GmbH, he created the Versuchsbau Gotha-Ost (VGO) consortium in a rented hangar at the Gotha factory. Alexander Baumann became his chief engineer, although later the team included other noted engineers including Zeppelin's associate Claudius Dornier, the 1915 pioneer of all-metal aircraft construction in Hugo Junkers and Baumann's protogé Adolph Rohrbach. Almost all of these Zeppelin-Staaken Riesenflugzeug designs used some variation of either pusher configuration and/or <b>push-pull</b> <b>configuration</b> in their engine layout, orientation and placement of their powerplants.|$|E
40|$|System {{parameters}} for solenoid actuators {{are important for}} high performance control and for self-sensing. Due to the nonlinearities in the solenoid actuators, parameter identification procedures that aim to obtain the electro-mechanical property can be complex and time consuming. In this paper, a self-calibration procedure for solenoid actuators in <b>push-pull</b> <b>configurations</b> is proposed. Utilizing {{the fact that the}} inductances of the solenoids share the same parameters as those for the electromagnetic force, the {{parameters for}} the electromagnetic force can be obtained from the easily obtainable electrical signals such as the voltage and current signals, and two inexpensive on-off sensors. The calibration procedure involves only actuating the solenoid actuator back and forth. Simulation study is presented to verify the method. ...|$|R

50|$|Although the {{original}} 2N3055 went into decline relative to epitaxial-base transistors {{because of high}} manufacturing costs, the epitaxial-base version continued {{to be used in}} both linear amplifiers and switching supplies. Several versions of the 2N3055 remain in production; it is used in audio power amplifiers delivering up to 40 W into an 8 ohm load in a <b>push-pull</b> output <b>configuration.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Dornier Seastar is a {{parasol wing}} flying boat, {{powered by a}} pair of Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-112 engines, mounted in a single nacelle over the wings in a <b>push-pull</b> <b>configuration.</b> In general layout, it {{strongly}} resembles both the innovative Dornier Wal all-metal monoplane flying boat of the 1920s, of which over 250 examples were built, and its direct successor, the larger Dornier Flugzeugwerke's Do 18 of the 1930s. Locating both of the engines {{in the center of the}} wing enables the weight of the engines to be more effective in reducing any induced rolling motions; it also protects the engines themselves from water spray, reducing corrosion, and eliminates asymmetric thrust when operating.|$|E
25|$|The MB-4 was {{designed}} to meet a June 1919 specification from the United States Post Office Department for a two- or three-engined mailplane, required to carry 1,500lb (682kg) of mail on a single engine. Thomas-Morse chose to use {{as much as possible}} of its existing Thomas-Morse MB-3 fighter in order to reduce costs, using two engineless MB-3 fuselages to carry the crew and cargo, with the pilot in a cockpit in the nose of the port fuselage and the co-pilot/mechanic in a similar cockpit in the nose of the starboard fuselage, while cargo was carried behind the crew in each fuselage. Two 300hp (224kW) Wright-Hisso H V8 engines were mounted in a central nacelle between the two main fuselages in a <b>push-pull</b> <b>configuration,</b> with fuel tanks mounted between the engines.|$|E
25|$|The {{wavelengths}} {{at which}} azobenzene isomerization occurs {{depends on the}} particular structure of each azo molecule, but they are typically grouped into three classes: the azobenzene-type molecules, the aminoazobenzenes, and the pseudo-stilbenes. These azos are yellow, orange, and red, respectively, owing to the subtle differences in their electronic absorption spectra. The compounds similar to the unsubstituted azobenzene exhibit a low-intensity n-π* absorption in the visible region, and a much higher intensity π-π* absorption in the ultraviolet. Azos that are ortho- or para-substituted with electron-donating groups (such as aminos), are classified as aminoazobenzenes, and tend to closely spaced n-π* and π-π* bands in the visible. The pseudo-stilbene class is characterized by substituting the 4 and 4' positions of the two azo rings with electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups (that is, the two {{opposite ends of the}} aromatic system are functionalized). The addition of this <b>push-pull</b> <b>configuration</b> results in a strongly asymmetric electron distribution, which modifies a host of optical properties. In particular, it shifts the absorption spectra of the trans and the cis isomers, so that they effectively overlap. Thus, for these compounds a single wavelength of light in the visible region will induce both the forward and reverse isomerization. Under illumination, these molecules cycle between the two isomeric states.|$|E
5000|$|The 6V6 is a beam-power tetrode vacuum tube. The {{first of}} this family of tubes to be {{introduced}} was the 6V6G by Ken-Rad Tube & Lamp Corporation in late 1936, with the availability by December of both Ken-Rad and Raytheon 6V6G tubes announced. [...] It is still in use in audio applications, especially electric guitar amplifiers. Following the introduction in July 1936 of the 6L6, {{the potential of the}} scaled down version that became the 6V6 was soon realized. The lower-powered 6V6 was better suited for average home use, and became common in the audio output stages of [...] "farmhouse" [...] table-top radios, where power pentodes such as the 6F6 had previously been used. The 6V6 required less heater power and produced less distortion than the 6F6, while yielding higher output in both single-ended and <b>push-pull</b> <b>configurations.</b> Although the 6V6 was originally designed especially for use in automobile radios, the clip-in Loctal base 7C5, from early 1939, or the lower heater current 12V6GT, both with the identical characteristics to the 6V6, but with the smaller T-9 glass envelope, soon became the tubes of choice for many automotive radios manufacturers. Additionally, the 6V6 had applications in portable battery-operated radios.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} is {{presented}} the example of construction of push-pull inverter {{that can be used}} in two different topologies, with two input voltages and three power ratings which can at the same time achieve AVR function and “power-save” feature. Special attention was paid to scheme, turn ratio calculation and transformer coil windings arrangements that with only two types (of different power ratings) allows realization of large number of <b>push-pull</b> inverter <b>configurations</b> that can be applied to different power supply systems...|$|R
50|$|Despite its {{advantages}} <b>push-pull</b> <b>configurations</b> are rare in military aircraft. In {{addition to the}} problems noted for civil aircraft, the increased risk to the pilot {{in the case of}} a crash or the need to parachute from the aircraft also pose problems. During a crash the rear engine may crush the pilot and if bailing out, the pilot is in danger of hitting the propeller. Examples of past military applications include the German Siemens-Schuckert DDr.I twin-engined triplane fighter prototype of 1917, and the unsuccessful asymmetric push-pull Gotha G.VI which has its engines offset from each other, mounted on the front and rear ends of two separate fuselages. More successful was the Italian Caproni Ca.3 trimotor, with two tractor engines and one pusher. Between the wars, most push-pull aircraft were flying boats, of which the Dornier Wal was probably the most numerous, while a number of heavy bombers, such as the Farman F.220 used engines mounted in push-pull pairs under the wings. Near the end of World War II, the German Dornier Do 335 push-pull twin-engined heavy fighter featured explosive charges to jettison the rear propeller and an ejection seat. One of the last military aircraft to use the configuration was the American Cessna O-2, which was used for forward air control during the Vietnam war.|$|R
2500|$|The {{first was}} a twin-boom {{monoplane}} with two [...] Mitsubishi Ha211 18-cylinder engines, driving two 4-blade propellers in a <b>push-pull</b> <b>configuration.</b> [...] The very heavy armament {{that should have been}} mounted on the aircraft (two 37mm/1.46in and two 30mm/1.18in cannons, should have been enough to make short work of most US heavy bombers of the era. Notwithstanding the outstanding prospective performance, which however was judged as [...] "unduly optimistic" [...] by the technical department of the Japanese Army Air Force, this design was judged too complex by the technical department and the design was discarded.|$|E
2500|$|The Cessna Skymaster is a United States {{twin-engine}} civil {{utility aircraft}} {{built in a}} <b>push-pull</b> <b>configuration.</b> Its engines are mounted in the nose and rear of its pod-style fuselage. Twin booms extend aft of the wings to the vertical stabilizers, with the rear engine between them. The horizontal stabilizer is aft of the pusher propeller, mounted between and connecting the two booms. [...] The combined tractor and pusher engines produce centerline thrust and a unique sound. The Cessna O-2 Skymaster is a military version of the Cessna 337 Super Skymaster.|$|E
2500|$|Some civil {{propeller}} driven {{aircraft that}} have used {{one or more}} pairs of engines in <b>push-pull</b> <b>configuration</b> have been flying boats, with engines mounted above the wing and clear of spray. Others have {{had a pair of}} engines, one at either end of a pod fuselage with a tail unit mounted on a pair of booms, for example the Cessna Skymaster, the Adam A500 or the Rutan Voyager. The Moynet 360 Jupiter was an example of a push-pull aircraft of a less common configuration, where a single conventional fuselage has an engine at either end; the Dornier Do 335 fighter used the same arrangement. [...] For light civil aircraft, the aim was to combine the performance of a conventional twin-engined aircraft with the ease of handling of a single-engined one.|$|E
5000|$|Power valves (tubes) can be overdriven in {{the same}} way that {{pre-amplifier}} valves can, but because these valves are designed to output more power, the distortion and character they add to the guitar's tone is unique. During the 1960s to early 1970s, distortion was primarily created by overdriving the power valves. Because they have become accustomed to this sound , many guitar players [...] favour this type of distortion, and thus set their amps to maximum levels in order to drive the power section hard. Many valve-based amplifiers in common use have a <b>push-pull</b> output <b>configuration</b> in their power section, with matched pairs of tubes driving the output transformer. Power amplifier distortion is normally entirely symmetric, generating predominantly odd-order harmonics.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} the numerical analysis of a new dielectric probe (DP) for non-invasive near field antenna measurements. The probe consists of a Lithium Niobate (LiNb 03) substrate with a Mach-Zehnder (MZ) interferometer in <b>push-pull</b> (PP) <b>configuration</b> integrated in, and an optimized short dipole antenna printed on its surface. The strong electro-optic effect of LiNb 03, {{in combination with the}} PP behaviour of the MZ interferometer, allows the amplitude modulation of an optical carrier by the external electric field incident on the probe. Moreover, the short dipole antenna guarantees effective selectivity towards the incident field polarization. The numerical analysis estimates a nearly flat frequency response in the band [1 - 10] GHz and a minimum detectable signal of a 8. 8 mV/m √Hz...|$|R
40|$|M. Ing. (Electrical and Electronic Engineering) In {{an attempt}} to build a 2000 A {{transistor}} switch. {{with the possibility of}} integrating the electromagnetic components, different transistor switch and transformer configurations were investigated and compared. A standard high frequency monolithic transformer was investigated for the integration {{with the rest of the}} circuit. Different problems were found as will be discussed. A saturation of the transformer to one side occurred, and a control circuit for this was developed and is discussed. A different approach to transformers, matrix transformers, was investigated for the application in high current, low voltage supplies, such as a compensating supply for a compensated Darlington transistor. From the matrix transformers a new kind of transformer connection style, namely a symmetric transformer, followed. The symmetrical transformer was investigated for the possible use in monolitic transformers, and compared with halfbridge, fullbridge and <b>push-pull</b> transformer <b>configurations.</b> It was decided to proceed further with matrix transformers. A design of a 400 A 1. 5 Vsupply, was done to serve as a compensating supply in a 2000 A compensated Darlington transistor switch. The supply was built up and analysed. Different switch configurations were investigated for use as possible transistor switches. The compensated Darlington was considered to be the best. Unexpected switch off problems occurred. These are discussed and an optimum switch off topology is suggested. A 2000 A transistor switch was designed and built. Full current could not be reached and results are presented up to 650 A...|$|R
2500|$|The final Equator, {{numbered}} P-300 {{like the}} first, reverted to Lycoming piston power {{but with the}} engine mounted in pusher configuration on a pylon above the fuselage and wing, partly to allow later models to use different engines or even to have two engines in <b>push-pull</b> <b>configuration.</b> The sponsons were removed and wing roots were lowered to below mid-fuselage line and dihedral added, stabilizing the aircraft on {{the water with a}} [...] "water-wing", the centre section undersides in contact with the water, an idea developed by the US Navy and used in the Taylor Coot homebuilt amphibian. [...] The earlier upright fin was replaced by a wide chord, swept but still cruciform tail.
