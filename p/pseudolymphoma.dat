25|$|A 2013 {{systematic}} {{review of the}} English-language case reports found that serious adverse events associated with acupuncture are rare, but that acupuncture is not without risk. Between 2000 and 2011 the English-language literature from 25 countries and regions reported 294 adverse events. The majority of the reported adverse events were relatively minor, and the incidences were low. For example, a prospective survey of 34,000 acupuncture treatments found no serious adverse events and 43 minor ones, a rate of 1.3 per 1000 interventions. Another survey found there were 7.1% minor adverse events, of which 5 were serious, amid 97,733 acupuncture patients. The most common adverse effect observed was infection (e.g. mycobacterium), {{and the majority of}} infections were bacterial in nature, caused by skin contact at the needling site. Infection has also resulted from skin contact with unsterilized equipment or with dirty towels in an unhygienic clinical setting. Other adverse complications included five reported cases of spinal cord injuries (e.g. migrating broken needles or needling too deeply), four brain injuries, four peripheral nerve injuries, five heart injuries, seven other organ and tissue injuries, bilateral hand edema, epithelioid granuloma, <b>pseudolymphoma,</b> argyria, pustules, pancytopenia, and scarring due to hot-needle technique. Adverse reactions from acupuncture, which are unusual and uncommon in typical acupuncture practice, included syncope, galactorrhoea, bilateral nystagmus, pyoderma gangrenosum, hepatotoxicity, eruptive lichen planus, and spontaneous needle migration.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{differential}} diagnosis of B-cell lymphoproliferative processes remains {{a challenge for}} pathologists, dermatologists and oncologists, despite advances in histology, immunohistochemistry and molecular biology. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate aid and limitations of clonality analysis in the diagnosis of primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas and B-cell <b>pseudolymphomas.</b> METHODS: This study included 29 cases of B-cell lymphoproliferative processes classified as primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas (13), B-cell <b>pseudolymphomas</b> (6) and inconclusive cases (10) using histology and immunohistochemistry. The clonality analysis was performed by polymerase chain reaction analysis of immunoglobulin light chain and heavy chain rearrangements. RESULTS: DNA quality was shown to be generally poor; eight samples were inadequate for polymerase chain reaction analysis. The results showed monoclonality in eight of the primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas and polyclonality {{in four of the}} B-cell <b>pseudolymphomas.</b> In addition, monoclonality was shown in two of the inconclusive cases by histology and immunohistochemistry, demonstrating the utility of polymerase chain reaction as an ancillary diagnostic tool for primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas. DISCUSSION: The low quality DNA extracted from these cases demanded the use of an IgH protocol that yielded small fragments and IgK. Both methods used together improved detection. CONCLUSION: Use of the two protocols, immunoglobulin heavy chain FR 3 -trad and immunoglobulin light chain-Kappa Biomed protocols for clonality analysis improved diagnostic accuracy...|$|R

40|$|It is very {{difficult}} to distinguish primary cutaneous carcinomas correctly from metastatic carcinomas. In addition, primary cutaneous lymphomas closely resemble various <b>pseudolymphomas.</b> Apocrine carcinomas and extramammary Paget’s diseases possessed cytokeratin 20 (CK 20) －/gross cystic disease fluid protein(GCDFP) 15 ＋ immunoreactivity, while pagetoid phenomena from metastatic transitional cell carcinomas and rectal carcinomas showed CK 20 ＋/GCDFP 15 － immunoreactivity. Primary cutaneous signet-ring cell carcinomas were positive for both CK 20 and GCDFP 15. CK 20 -positive primary cutaneous carcinomas should include primary cutaneous signet-ring cell carcinoma in addition to Merkel cell carcinoma. Primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas including marginal zone B-cell lymphoma demonstrated light chain restriction immunohistochemically. In various <b>pseudolymphomas</b> including acral pseudolymphomatous angiokeratoma of children, there was a mixture of kappa-positive and lambda-positive cells, although kappa-positive cells predominated.

40|$|MT 2 /CD 45 RA and anti-bcl- 2 protein (Bcl- 2) {{monoclonal}} antibodies {{are useful}} markers in distinguishing follicular lymphomas from reactive follicular hyperplasia of the lymph nodes. We examined biopsy specimens from 11 patients with primary cutaneous B-cell follicle center lymphomas, 10 patients with cutaneous <b>pseudolymphomas</b> with germinal centers, and 6 patients with inflammatory infiltrates with germinal centers in non-lymphoid cutaneous tumors (3 basal cell carcinomas, 2 malignant melanomas, and 1 solar keratosis), {{in order to}} evaluate the utility of MT 2 and anti-Bcl- 2 antibodies in differentiating benign from malignant germinal center cell proliferations in the skin. Immunohistochemical evaluation of MT 2 and Bcl- 2 was focused exclusively on the reactivity of germinal center cells. Specific membranous MT 2 positivity was found in 2 / 11 cutaneous follicle center lymphomas; a diffuse, non-specific staining pattern was identified in 3 / 11 follicle center lymphomas and in 1 / 6 inflammatory infiltrates in non-lymphoid tumors. A negative MT 2 reaction was observed in 6 / 11 follicle center cell lymphomas, in all cases of <b>pseudolymphomas</b> and in 5 / 6 inflammatory infiltrates in non-lymphoid tumors. Bcl- 2 positivity was detected only in 1 / 11 follicle center lymphomas. Germinal center cells in all other cases were Bcl- 2 negative. Our results suggest that MT 2 and anti-Bcl- 2 antibodies are only of limited value in differentiating primary cutaneous follicle center lymphomas from cutaneous <b>pseudolymphomas</b> with germinal centers...|$|R
40|$|The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome has {{recently}} been identified in Hodgkin's disease (HD) and nodal non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL). In order to elucidate the possible aetiopathogenetic role of EBV in benign and malignant lymphoproliferative disorders we investigated skin specimens from 24 patients with a primary cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorders (10 T-cell lymphomas 6 B-cell lymphomas and 8 <b>pseudolymphomas)</b> and from 22 normal individuals {{for the presence of}} EBV DNA using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique and in situ hybridization (ISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections.

40|$|The {{histogenesis}} {{of primary}} cutaneous marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (PCMZL) {{has not yet}} been clarified.

We analyzed the presence of PDC by immunohistochemistry in various forms of primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas and in B-cell <b>pseudolymphomas.</b> Clusters of CD 123 +PDC were observed in all PCMZL (23 of 23 cases; 100 %) and in two-thirds of cutaneous B-cell <b>pseudolymphomas</b> (14 of 22; 64 %), but only in a minority of primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma (4 of 31; 13 %) and not in primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leg type. CD 123 + PDC clusters were found in close proximity to monoclonal plasma cells and T-cells and were already present at high numbers in early lesions and initial recurrences of PCMZL. In conclusion, the detection of larger clusters of PDC in PCMZL provides a useful adjunctive diagnostic marker and suggests a pathogenetically relevant role of these cells in PCMZL. Furthermore, the occurrence of PDC could explain the high number of T-cells typically found in PCMZL. We propose considering PCMZL as a unique and potentially antigen-driven neoplasm with PDC, T-cells, and B-cells as the constitutive tumor components...|$|R
