5|$|The {{axillary}} arch {{is considered}} to have no functional significance, although one small study of 22 participants has reported an increase in strength, endurance and motor control of the arm in women (but not men) with the arch as compared with those without; and an improvement in shoulder <b>proprioception</b> in both men and women.|$|E
5|$|Anterior cord syndrome, due {{to damage}} to the front portion of the spinal cord or {{reduction}} in the blood supply from the anterior spinal artery, {{can be caused by}} fractures or dislocations of vertebrae or herniated disks. Below the level of injury, motor function, pain sensation, and temperature sensation are lost, while sense of touch and <b>proprioception</b> (sense of position in space) remain intact. These differences are due to the relative locations of the spinal tracts responsible for each type of function.|$|E
5|$|Ely Rabin and Andrew M. Gordon {{reported}} in 2004 in the Journal of Applied Physiology on {{their use of}} the Magic Wand to create vibrations in the left biceps brachia to study <b>proprioception</b> signals in humans related to fingertip contact on surfaces. Rabin and Gordon followed up their research in 2006 with a subsequent paper published in the journal Experimental Brain Research. They wrote that extension of muscles and sensory clues worked together to provide regional perception of the patient's upper extremity in a localized area. Rabin and Gordon later co-wrote a 2010 paper with additional authors in Neuroscience Letters and expanded on research incorporating use of the Magic Wand to stimulate the biceps brachia. They measured people suffering Parkinson's disease (PD) for proprioceptive ability while their subjects' biceps muscles were stimulated with the vibrator. In 2007, researchers published a paper in the journal Gait & Posture about use of the Magic Wand to help measure balance and postural sway. While testing their subjects' balance while having to deal with simultaneous vibration, the researchers attached one Magic Wand to each leg.|$|E
25|$|The {{somatosensory}} cortex decodes nociceptor info {{to determine the}} exact location of pain and is where <b>proprioception</b> is brought into consciousness; inferior cerebellar peduncle is all unconscious <b>proprioception.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Proprioception</b> is {{determined}} by using standard mechanoreceptors (especially ruffini corpuscles (stretch) and transient receptor potential (TRP) channels). <b>Proprioception</b> is completely covered within the somatosensory system as the brain processes them together.|$|E
25|$|This {{overview}} discusses <b>proprioception,</b> thermoception, chemoception and nociception as {{they are}} all integrally connected.|$|E
25|$|Elderly {{individuals}} are also predisposed to hip fractures due to many {{factors that can}} compromise <b>proprioception</b> and balance, including medications, vertigo, stroke, and peripheral neuropathy.|$|E
25|$|An {{apparatus}} {{that uses a}} head-mounted display and a touch that confuses the sense of <b>proprioception</b> (and which can also create the sensation of additional limbs).|$|E
25|$|<b>Proprioception,</b> the {{kinesthetic}} sense, {{provides the}} parietal cortex {{of the brain}} with information on the movement and relative positions of {{the parts of the}} body. Neurologists test this sense by telling patients to close their eyes and touch their own nose with the tip of a finger. Assuming proper proprioceptive function, at no time will the person lose awareness of where the hand actually is, even though it is not being detected by any of the other senses. <b>Proprioception</b> and touch are related in subtle ways, and their impairment results in surprising and deep deficits in perception and action.|$|E
25|$|The sternocleidomastoid is {{innervated by}} the {{accessory}} nerve {{of the same}} side. It supplies only motor fibres. The cervical plexus supplies sensation, including <b>proprioception,</b> via the ventral primary rami of C2 and C3.|$|E
25|$|Finally, slit {{sense organs}} are slit-like pits {{covered with a}} thin membrane. Inside the pit, a small hair touches the {{underside}} of the membrane, and detects its motion. Slit sense organs are believed to be involved in <b>proprioception,</b> and possibly also hearing.|$|E
25|$|Position, in this context, {{refers to}} {{conscious}} <b>proprioception.</b> Proprioceptors (muscle spindle and Golgi tendon organs) {{provide information about}} joint position and muscle movement. Although much of this information is processed at an unconscious level (primarily by the cerebellum and the vestibular nuclei), some is available at a conscious level.|$|E
25|$|A neuroscientific {{explanation}} {{claims that}} intruder hallucinations arise {{due to a}} functional disturbance in the multisensory processing of body and self at the temporoparietal junction (TPJ). During sleep paralysis there is a desynchrony between motor-execution and feedback from limbs (<b>proprioception)</b> which results in massive deafferentation (conflicting efferent and afferent neural conduction).|$|E
25|$|Of course, {{it is not}} {{possible}} to remove all hazards; the most important factor affecting human physical well-being in space is weightlessness, more accurately defined as Micro-g environment. Living in this type of environment impacts the body in three important ways: loss of <b>proprioception,</b> changes in fluid distribution, and deterioration of the musculoskeletal system.|$|E
25|$|Spatial {{memories}} are formed after an animal gathers and processes sensory information about its surroundings (especially vision and <b>proprioception).</b> In general, mammals require a functioning hippocampus (particularly area CA1) {{in order to}} form and process memories about space. There {{is some evidence that}} human spatial memory is strongly tied to the right hemisphere of the brain.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the current}} commercially {{available}} prosthetic devices mainly focusing {{in implementing the}} motor side by simply uses EMG sensors to switch between different activation states of the prosthesis. Very limited works have proposed a system to involve by integrating the sensory side. The integration of tactile sense and <b>proprioception</b> is regarded as essential for implementing the ability to perceive environmental input.|$|E
25|$|Exteroceptive senses are {{senses that}} {{perceive}} the body's own position, motion, and state, known as proprioceptive senses. External senses include the traditional five: sight, hearing, touch, smell and taste, {{as well as}} thermoception (temperature differences) and possibly an additional weak magnetoception (direction). Proprioceptive senses include nociception (pain); equilibrioception (balance); <b>proprioception</b> (a sense of the position and movement of the parts of one's own body).|$|E
25|$|This is {{the last}} phase of the {{recovery}} rehabilitation. Phase V includes returning to sports after being cleared by therapist or surgeon. In order {{for this to happen}} the patient must have full range of motion, continue maintaining strength and endurance, and be able to increase <b>proprioception</b> with agility drills. Patient is still to be aware that going down hill or down stairs while the knee is aggravated may cause further injury like a meniscus tear.|$|E
25|$|By far, the {{two most}} common {{symptoms}} described are pain and the feeling that teeth no longer correctly meet (traumatic malocclusion, or disocclusion). The teeth {{are very sensitive to}} pressure (<b>proprioception),</b> so even a small change in the location of the teeth will generate this sensation. People will also be very sensitive to touching the area of the jaw that is broken, {{or in the case of}} condylar fracture the area just in front of the tragus of the ear.|$|E
25|$|A balance {{disorder}} is a disturbance that causes {{an individual to}} feel unsteady, for example when standing or walking. It may be accompanied by feelings of giddiness, or wooziness, or having a sensation of movement, spinning, or floating. Balance {{is the result of}} several body systems working together: the visual system (eyes), vestibular system (ears) and <b>proprioception</b> (the body's sense of where it is in space). Degeneration or loss of function in any of these systems can lead to balance deficits.|$|E
25|$|All nerve fibers are {{sensitive}} to LAs, but due {{to a combination of}} diameter and myelination, fibers have different sensitivities to LA blockade, termed differential blockade. Type B fibers (sympathetic tone) are the most sensitive followed by type C (pain), type A delta (temperature), type A gamma (<b>proprioception),</b> type A beta (sensory touch and pressure), and type A alpha (motor). Although type B fibers are thicker than type C fibers, they are myelinated, thus are blocked before the unmyelinated, thin C fiber.|$|E
25|$|The {{prevalence}} of basement membranes in the tissues of Eumetazoans means that most cell types require attachment to survive. This requirement {{has led to}} the development of complex mechanotransduction pathways, allowing cells to sense the stiffness of the substratum. Such signaling is mainly orchestrated in focal adhesions, regions where the integrin-bound actin cytoskeleton detects changes and transmits them downstream through YAP1. Calcium-dependent cell adhesion molecules such as cadherins and selectins can also mediate mechanotransduction. Specialised forms of mechanotransduction within the nervous system are responsible for mechanosensation: hearing, touch, <b>proprioception</b> and balance.|$|E
25|$|In addition, one of {{the most}} {{important}} ("first rank") diagnostic symptoms of schizophrenia is the patient's delusion of being controlled by an external force. People with schizophrenia will sometimes report that, although they are acting in the world, they do not recall initiating the particular actions they performed. This is sometimes likened to being a robot controlled by someone else. Although the neural mechanisms of schizophrenia are not yet clear, one influential hypothesis is that there is a breakdown in brain systems that compare motor commands with the feedback received from the body (known as <b>proprioception),</b> leading to attendant hallucinations and delusions of control.|$|E
25|$|Teeth (singular tooth) {{are small}} whitish {{structures}} {{found in the}} jaws (or mouths) of many vertebrates {{that are used to}} tear, scrape, milk and chew food. Teeth are not made of bone, but rather of tissues of varying density and hardness, such as enamel, dentine and cementum. Human teeth have a blood and nerve supply which enables <b>proprioception.</b> This is the ability of sensation when chewing, for example if we were to bite into something too hard for our teeth, such as a chipped plate mixed in food, our teeth send a message to our brain and we realise that it cannot be chewed, so we stop trying.|$|E
25|$|Humans have a {{multitude}} of sensors. Sight (vision), hearing (audition), taste (gustation), smell (olfaction), and touch (somatosensation) are the five traditionally recognized senses. The ability to detect other stimuli beyond those governed by these most broadly recognized senses also exists, and these sensory modalities include temperature (thermoception), kinesthetic sense (<b>proprioception),</b> pain (nociception), balance (equilibrioception), vibration (mechanoreception), and various internal stimuli (e.g. the different chemoreceptors for detecting salt and carbon dioxide concentrations in the blood, or sense of hunger and sense of thirst). However, what constitutes a sense {{is a matter of}} some debate, leading to difficulties in defining what exactly a distinct sense is, and where the borders between responses to related stimuli lie.|$|E
25|$|Another common {{symptom of}} copper {{deficiency}} is peripheral neuropathy, which is numbness or tingling that can {{start in the}} extremities and can sometimes progress radially inward towards the torso. In an Advances in Clinical Neuroscience & Rehabilitation (ACNR) published case report, a 69-year-old patient had progressively worsened neurological symptoms. These symptoms included diminished upper limb reflexes with abnormal lower limb reflexes, sensation to light touch and pin prick was diminished above the waist, vibration sensation {{was lost in the}} sternum, and markedly reduced <b>proprioception</b> or sensation about the self’s orientation. Many people suffering from the neurological effects of copper deficiency complain about very similar or identical symptoms as the patient. This numbness and tingling poses danger for the elderly because it increases their risk of falling and injuring themselves. Peripheral neuropathy can become very disabling leaving some patients dependent on wheel chairs or walking canes for mobility if there is lack of correct diagnosis. Rarely can copper deficiency cause major disabling symptoms. The deficiency will have to be present for an extensive amount of time until such disabling conditions manifest.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the tail's ability to {{function}} as a proprioceptive sensor/modulator has also been investigated. As aforementioned, the tail demonstrates a high degree of muscularization and subsequent innervation that ostensibly collaborate in orienting the organism. Specifically, this is accomplished by coordinated flexion and extension of tail muscles to produce slight shifts in the organism's center of mass, orientation, etc., which ultimately assists it with achieving a state of proprioceptive balance in its environment. Further mechanobiological investigations of the constituent tendons in the tail of the rat have identified multiple factors that influence how the organism navigates its environment with this structure. A particular example is that of a study in which the morphology of these tendons is explicated in detail. Namely, cell viability tests of tendons of the rat's tail demonstrate a higher proportion of living fibroblasts that produce the collagen for these fibers. As in humans, these tendons contain a high density of golgi tendon organs that help the animal assess stretching of muscle in situ and adjust accordingly by relaying the information to higher cortical areas associated with balance, <b>proprioception,</b> and movement.|$|E
25|$|The {{spinal cord}} {{processes}} and interprets <b>proprioception</b> {{in a manner}} similar to how our visual system processes information. When we view a painting, the brain interprets the total visual field, as opposed to processing each individual pixel of information independently, and then derives an image. At any instant the spinal cord receives an ensemble of information from all receptors throughout the body that signals a proprioceptive “image” that represents time and space, and it computes which neurons to excite next based on the most recently perceived “images.” The importance of the CPG is not simply its ability to generate repetitive cycles, but also to receive, interpret, and predict the appropriate sequences of actions during any part of the step cycle, i.e., state dependence. The peripheral input then provides important information from which the probabilities of a given set of neurons being active at any given time can be finely tuned to a given situation during a specific phase of a step cycle. An excellent example of this is when a mechanical stimulus is applied to the dorsum of the paw of a cat. When the stimulus is applied during the swing phase, the flexor muscles of that limb are excited, and the result is enhanced flexion in order to step over the obstacle that created the stimulus. However, when the same stimulus is applied during stance, the extensors are excited. Thus, the functional connectivity between mechanoreceptors and specific interneuronal populations within the spinal cord varies according to the physiological state. Even the efficacy of the monosynaptic input from muscle spindles to the motor neuron changes readily from one part of the step cycle to another, according to whether a subject is running or walking.|$|E
500|$|Brown-Séquard {{syndrome}} {{occurs when}} the spinal cord is injured on one side {{much more than the}} other. It is rare for the spinal cord to be truly hemisected (severed on one side), but partial lesions due to penetrating wounds (such as gunshot or knife wounds) or fractured vertebrae or tumors are [...] common. On the ipsilateral side of the injury (same side), the body loses motor function, <b>proprioception,</b> and senses of vibration and touch. On the contralateral (opposite side) of the injury, there is a loss of pain and temperature sensations.|$|E
500|$|Hans Asperger's initial {{accounts}} and other diagnostic schemes include descriptions of physical clumsiness. Children with AS may be delayed in acquiring skills requiring motor dexterity, such as riding a bicycle or opening a jar, and {{may seem to}} move awkwardly or feel [...] "uncomfortable in their own skin". They may be poorly coordinated, or have an odd or bouncy gait or posture, poor handwriting, or problems with visual-motor integration. They may show problems with <b>proprioception</b> (sensation of body position) on measures of developmental coordination disorder (motor planning disorder), balance, tandem gait, and finger-thumb apposition. There {{is no evidence that}} these motor skills problems differentiate AS from other high-functioning ASDs.|$|E
500|$|Posterior cord syndrome, {{in which}} just the dorsal columns of {{the spinal cord}} are affected, is usually seen in cases of chronic {{myelopathy}} but can also occur with infarction of the posterior spinal artery. [...] This rare syndrome causes the loss of <b>proprioception</b> and sense of vibration {{below the level of}} injury while motor function and sensation of pain, temperature, and touch remain intact. [...] Usually posterior cord injuries result from insults like disease or vitamin deficiency rather than trauma. Tabes dorsalis, due to injury to the posterior part of the spinal cord caused by syphilis, results in loss of touch and proprioceptive sensation.|$|E
500|$|Not all {{dogs with}} SM show {{scratching}} behavior. [...] Not all dogs who show scratching behavior appear to suffer pain, though several leading researchers, including Dr Clare Rusbridge in the UK and Drs Curtis Dewey and Dominic Marino in the US, believe scratching in SM cavaliers {{is a sign}} of pain and discomfort and of existing neurological damage to the dorsal horn region of the spine. [...] If onset is at an early age, a first sign may be scratching and/or rapidly appearing scoliosis. [...] If the problem is severe, there is likely to be poor <b>proprioception</b> (awareness of body position), especially with regard to the forelimbs. [...] Clumsiness and falling results from this problem. Progression is variable though the majority of dogs showing symptoms by age four tend to see progression of the condition.|$|E

2500|$|J. Nigro Sansonese, {{using the}} mythography {{supplied}} by Mylonas, has recently (1994) {{hypothesized that the}} Mysteries of Eleusis originally were a series of practical initiations into trance involving <b>proprioception</b> of the human nervous system induced by breath control (similar to samyama in yoga). [...] Sansonese speculates that the kisté, a box holding sacred objects opened by the hierophant, is actually an esoteric reference to the initiate's skull, within which is seen a sacred light and are heard sacred sounds, but only after instruction in trance practice. [...] Similarly, the seed-filled chambers of a pomegranate, a fruit associated with {{the founding of the}} cult, esoterically describe <b>proprioception</b> of the initiate's heart during trance.|$|E
2500|$|Pseudoathetosis is a {{movement}} disorder, very similar to athetosis, in which the symptoms are not differentiable from those of actual athetosis, however the underlying cause is different. [...] While actual athetosis is caused by damage to the brain, specifically in the basal ganglia, pseudoathetosis {{is caused by the}} loss of <b>proprioception.</b> [...] The loss in <b>proprioception</b> is caused by damage to the area between the primary somatosensory cortex and the muscle spindles and joint receptors. [...] Additionally, when observing an MRI, {{it can be seen that}} in the brain of a pseudoathetoid patient, lesions on the brain are not seen in the basal ganglia, the area that is oftentimes the cause of athetosis.|$|E
