Number of data bits embedded inside barcode will be increased by encoding data through orientation modulation in elliptical dot array. BARCODES that encode digital data on physical media are commonly utilized in commercial applications for tracing/tracking of trade items, in security applications for linking personal documents with a user, or in other applications as an auxiliary channel to encode additional information on a physical medium. which are fundamentally analog, these methods can add security and functionality and features that are associated with digital techniques at the expense of consuming space on the media. For instance, in <b>personal</b> <b>IDs,</b> driving licenses and passports, high capacity can enable the encoding of a sample speech signal, a picture, or other identifying personal information which in turn may be used to establish authenticity of the user. Care must, however, be exercised in designing color barcodes to ensure that they are robust to variations in the color printing and scanning processes, which have a greater impact when considering color rather than black/white reproduction and capture. 2 D bar codes are being considered for new emerging applications such as M-ticketing, where they carry selected information of a ticket that is received via a mobile phone; reliable and secure personal identification, where they store personal biometric data on the identification document; and visual communications with side information, where they can be used as an auxiliary channel conveying additional data for improving visual communications...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{the rapid}} {{increase}} of digitization within our society, digital identities gain more and more importance. Provided by the German eID solution, every citizen {{has the ability to}} identify himself against various governmental and private organizations {{with the help of his}} <b>personal</b> electronic <b>ID</b> card and a corresponding card reader. While there are several solutions available for desktop use of the eID infrastructure, mobile approaches have to be payed more attention. In this paper we present a new approach for using the German eID concept on an Android device without the need of the actual identity card and card reader. A security evaluation of our approach reveals that two non-critical vulnerabilities on the architecture can't be avoided. Nevertheless, no sensitive information are compromised. A proof of concept shows that an actual implementation faces some technical issues which have to be solved in the future.

40|$|In {{record linkage}} (RL), or exact file matching, {{the goal is}} to {{identify}} the links between entities with information on two or more files. RL is an important activity in areas including counting the population, enhancing survey frames and data, and conducting epidemiological and follow-up studies. RL is challenging when files are very large, no accurate <b>personal</b> identification (<b>ID)</b> number is present on all files for all units, and some information is recorded with error. Without an unique ID number one must rely on comparisons of names, addresses, dates, and other information to find the links. Latent class models can be used to automatically score the value of information for determining match status. Data for fitting models come from comparisons made within groups of units that pass initial file blocking requirements. Data distributions can vary across blocks.

40|$|Abstract Background Creating study {{identifiers}} and assigning them {{to study}} participants {{is an important}} feature in epidemiologic studies, ensuring the consistency and privacy of the study data. The numbering system for identifiers needs to be random within certain number constraints, to carry extensions coding for organizational information, or to contain multiple layers of numbers per participant to diversify data access. Available software can generate globally-unique identifiers, but identifier-creating tools meeting {{the special needs of}} epidemiological studies are lacking. We have thus set out to develop a software program to generate IDs for epidemiological or clinical studies. Results Our software IDGenerator creates unique identifiers that not only carry a random identifier for a study participant, but also support the creation of structured IDs, where organizational information is coded into the ID directly. This may include study center (for multicenter-studies), study track (for studies with diversified study programs), or study visit (baseline, follow-up, regularly repeated visits). Our software can be used to add a check digit to the ID to minimize data entry errors. It facilitates the generation of IDs in batches and the creation of layered <b>IDs</b> (<b>personal</b> data <b>ID,</b> study data ID, temporary ID, external data ID) to ensure a high standard of data privacy. The software is supported by a user-friendly graphic interface that enables the generation of IDs in both standard text and barcode 128 B format. Conclusion Our software IDGenerator can create identifiers meeting the specific needs for epidemiologic or clinical studies to facilitate study organization and data privacy.

40|$|Since the {{literature}} is indecisive about the correlation between self-esteem and academic achievement, this study aimed at trying to clarify and further investigate the relationship between self-esteem and academic performance within the Lebanese context. The proposed correlational study tried {{to determine whether the}} level of children’s self-esteem is significantly related to academic performance. Consequently, it is a quantitative method of research in which there were two quantitative variables to be assessed: Self-Esteem and Academic Achievement. Nonrandom, purposive sampling was used for this study. Participants were students enrolled in a private academic institution from grades 4, 5, and 6. The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSE) was administered to all students; each one had a <b>personal</b> confidential <b>ID,</b> and had to enter his/her ID on line so he/she can complete the Rosenberg survey. Results showed consistency in the percentages of self-esteem scale and academic performance. Students with high academic performance scored high on the RSE. Students with medium academic performance scored medium on RSE. However, data showed insignificant results regarding low academic averages with comparison/correlation to high, medium, and low self-esteem. N/A 1 hard copy: x, 94 leaves; 31 cm available at RNL.

40|$|A {{wireless}} {{sensor network}} (WSN) is {{a large number of}} sensor nodes distributed throughout large geographical area of interest. These sensors monitor various conditions by measuring different parameters like temperature, pressure, sound, light intensity, heat, movement, etc. The sensed data is routed to the sink node via intermediate sensor nodes. Thus we get accurate information about the parameters present in that area. Application design can be simplified by providing a set of programming primitives for sensor networks that abstract the details of lowlevel communication, data sharing, and collective operations. The focus on sensor networks for agriculture has a main topic of low power consumption and efficient implementation of hardware and software for various applications. The security threats involved in wireless technology cannot be ignored. Although difficult to achieve it is inevitable to secure the wireless communication network. For effective utilization of the WSN commercially, a security system for the wireless network is a must.

40|$|The {{laws in the}} Socialist Republic of Vietnam promote {{equality}} for all citizens and refer to ‘persons’ rather than ‘men’ or ‘women’. However, because of traditional gender norms, transgender people in Vietnam are facing severe stigma and discrimination in public, in schools, {{at home and in}} the workplace (CCIHP 2011; Hoang 2012; ICS 2015; iSEE 2013). Parents, teachers and policemen are among the most common perpetrators (CCIHP 2011, 2012 a, 2012 b). Before 1975, homosexuality and transgenderism were considered ‘social diseases’, ‘social evils’, and were targets for elimination in government health and public policies; after 1975, there was a higher emphasis on this as the public saw them as remnants of American neo-colonialism (Blanc 2005). People who were found to practice same-sex sex could be sent to an education centre (Blanc 2005). Transgender people have difficulty accessing services and rights as they cannot change their <b>personal</b> identification (<b>ID)</b> card, which is an obstacle to obtaining social services, housing and work. Gender roles and norms affect the employment practices, options and preferences of transmen and transwomen differently. This study, undertaken by the Center for Creative Initiatives in Health and Population (CCIHP) and Institute of Development Studies (IDS), does not claim to report on behalf of all transgender people in Vietnam, but we hope to gain more insights into both the opportunities and the obstacles that transmen and transwomen face and to understand how they could be supported to increase their livelihood options. First, the research involved a case study on transgender people and livelihood opportunities which sought to answer the following questions: What are the different employment options and preferences for Vietnamese transmen and transwomen? What are the links between stigma, education and employment? Second, it involved testing an integrated application of new quantitative online participatory methodologies on young transmen and transwomen communities, alongside qualitative face-to-face methods to reach elderly transgender people and employers who are not members of online communities. Qualitative interviews also help understand these communities better and provide information that can inform their development...|$|R
