40|$|Abstract: R Parameter <b>programming</b> and <b>Programming</b> <b>Jump</b> {{instruction}} is an advanced programming method in SIEMENS system and {{similar to the}} macro program in FANUC system. It uses parameter variables instead of functional codes and address values {{to make up a}} processing program. The R variables can plus, minus, multiply, divide, evolution, power, trigonometricfunction and so on in the logical calculation, In NC machining programming, uses R Parameter programming and is <b>Programming</b> <b>Jump</b> instruction, may realize the NC procedure logical judgment, comparison, transfer and other logic operation, resulting in a greatly simplified program, provides some solutions to numerical control programming for some special, complex and the similar parts...|$|R
3000|$|When any of {{the four}} keys (Up, Down, Enter, and Escape) is pressed, the <b>program</b> <b>jumps</b> to its {{corresponding}} interrupt routine and sets a flag for that particular key. By executing a get_key (...) function, the last key pressed is detected by reading the flags.|$|R

50|$|The <b>program</b> <b>jumps</b> {{from one}} area to another, but this jumping is formal and more easily predictable, because for loops and {{functions}} provide flow control whereas the goto statement encourages arbitrary flow control. Though this example is small, real world programs {{are composed of}} many lines of code and are difficult to maintain when written in a spaghetti code fashion.|$|R
50|$|BASIC-E {{and early}} {{versions}} of CBASIC compiled source code into an intermediate p-code file, {{which was then}} executed by a separate run-time interpreter program. CBASIC could execute in a minimum of 24 KB of memory. Line numbers in the program source were optional, unless needed as a label for a <b>program</b> <b>jump.</b> CBASIC proved very popular because it incorporated 14-digit binary-coded decimal (BCD) math which eliminated MBASIC's rounding errors that were sometimes troublesome for accounting.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We study {{sequential}} {{programs that}} are instruction sequences with direct and indirect jump instructions. The intuition is that indirect jump instructions are jump instructions where {{the position of the}} instruction to jump to is the content of some memory cell. We consider several kinds of indirect jump instructions. For each kind, we define the meaning of <b>programs</b> with indirect <b>jump</b> instructions of that kind by means of a translation into <b>programs</b> without indirect <b>jump</b> instructions. For each kind, the intended behaviour of a <b>program</b> with indirect <b>jump</b> instructions of that kind under execution is the behaviour of the translated program under execution on interaction with some memory device...|$|R

5000|$|The KC 85 {{could be}} {{programmed}} in assembly language and BASIC (the KC 85/2 had to load BASIC from tape), {{but it was}} possible to use various modules (sold by VEB Mikroelektronik Mühlhausen) or load software from tape, thus allowing programming in Forth and Pascal. The operating system was CAOS ("Cassette Aided Operating System"). It was a simple monitor where one could run different [...] "system services" [...] like LOAD (load a <b>program),</b> <b>JUMP</b> (into extension module ROM), MODIFY (memory cells) or BASIC (if it had been built into the ROM or had been loaded from tape).

5000|$|In {{this case}} the call into and return from a {{procedure}} is simple and extremely fast. A single instruction is called {{to set up a}} new block of registers—a new register window—and then, with operands passed into the procedure in the [...] "low end" [...] of the new window, the <b>program</b> <b>jumps</b> into the procedure. On return, the results are placed in the window at the same end, and the procedure exits. The register windows are set up to overlap at the ends, so that the results from the call simply [...] "appear" [...] in the window of the caller, with no data having to be copied. Thus the common procedure call does not have to interact with main memory, greatly accelerating it.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background This study {{examined}} the outcomes of a vocational rehabilitation program (The Job Management <b>Program,</b> <b>JUMP)</b> for persons with psychotic disorders based on close collaboration between health and welfare services. Methods Participants (N 2 ̆ 009 = 2 ̆ 009148) with broad schizophrenia spectrum disorders (age 182 ̆ 01365) were recruited from six counties in Norway. Three counties were randomized to vocational rehabilitation augmented with cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), while the remaining three counties were randomized to vocational rehabilitation augmented with cognitive remediation (CR). This paper compares the vocational activity of the total group of JUMP participants with a treatment as usual group (N 2 ̆ 009 = 2 ̆ 009341), and further examines {{differences between the two}} JUMP interventions. Employment status (working/not working) was registered at the time of inclusion {{and at the end of}} the intervention period. Results The total number of JUMP participants in any kind of vocational activity increased from 17 to 77...|$|R

50|$|Calling f with {{a regular}} {{function}} argument first applies this function to the value 2, then returns 3. However, when f is passed to call/cc (as in {{the last line of}} the example), applying the parameter (the continuation) to 2 forces execution of the <b>program</b> to <b>jump</b> to the point where call/cc was called, and causes call/cc to return the value 2. This is then printed by the display function.|$|R

Each paratrooper also carried a 24 feet (7.3 metres) reserve chest-pack, and the basic Japanese naval parachutists training <b>program</b> required <b>jumps</b> between 300-500 feet (90-150 m), which would not give much time to deploy the emergency chute, let alone hesitate in deploying the main canopy.|$|R

5000|$|It is {{possible}} to make a [...]COM file which will run under both operating systems. There is no true compatibility at the instruction level; the instructions at the entry point are chosen to be equal in functionality but different in both operating systems, and make <b>program</b> execution <b>jump</b> to the section for the operating system in use. It is basically two different programs with the same functionality in a single file, preceded by code selecting the one to use.|$|R
40|$|In {{traditional}} operating systems, user programs {{suffer from}} the overhead of system calls because of transitions between the user mode and the kernel mode across their protection boundary. However, this overhead can be eliminated if the user programs can be executed safely inside the kernel mode. We achieve this effect by developing a safe kernel mode execution mechanism using TAL, Typed Assembly Language. TAL is an assembly language which ensures memory safety and control flow safety of machine code through a type system. Memory safety means that a program accesses only memory which the program is permitted to access, while control flow safety means that a <b>program</b> <b>jumps</b> to only valid code which the program is permitted to execute. This memory and control flow safety are verified through a type checker using type annotations attached to machine code by the assembler of TAL. In our approach, user programs are written in TAL and their safety are verified through the type checker of TAL before they are executed in the kernel mode. Thus, user programs can be executed in the kernel mode both safely and efficiently, because their safety is verified befor...|$|R
