Basic configurations are diagrammed, and performance curves are given. A discrete communications model is derived and developed. The use of the APLL as an optimum angle demodulator and the Kalman-Bucy approach to APLL design are discussed. The literature {{in the area of}} <b>phase-locked</b> <b>loops</b> is reviewed, and an extensive bibliography is given.

25|$|These {{are used}} as voltage-controlled capacitors. These are {{important}} in PLL (<b>phase-locked</b> <b>loop)</b> and FLL (frequency-locked loop) circuits, allowing tuning circuits, {{such as those in}} television receivers, to lock quickly on to the frequency. They also enabled tunable oscillators in early discrete tuning of radios, where a cheap and stable, but fixed-frequency, crystal oscillator provided the reference frequency for a voltage-controlled oscillator.|$|E
25|$|Class 1 {{capacitors}} have {{a temperature}} coefficient that is typically fairly linear with temperature. These capacitors have very low electrical losses with a dissipation factor of approximately 0.15%. They undergo no significant aging processes and the capacitance value is nearly {{independent of the}} applied voltage. These characteristics allow applications for high Q filters, in resonant circuits and oscillators (for example, in <b>phase-locked</b> <b>loop</b> circuits).|$|E
25|$|Many FM {{detector}} circuits exist. A common {{method for}} recovering the information signal {{is through a}} Foster-Seeley discriminator. A <b>phase-locked</b> <b>loop</b> {{can be used as}} an FM demodulator. Slope detection demodulates an FM signal by using a tuned circuit which has its resonant frequency slightly offset from the carrier. As the frequency rises and falls the tuned circuit provides a changing amplitude of response, converting FM to AM. AM receivers may detect some FM transmissions by this means, although it does not provide an efficient means of detection for FM broadcasts.|$|E

Kolmogorov proposed this family as a simplified model for driven mechanical rotors (specifically, a free-spinning wheel weakly coupled by a spring to a motor). These circle map equations also describe a simplified model of the <b>phase-locked</b> <b>loop</b> in electronics. The map exhibits certain regions of its parameters where it is locked to the driving frequency (phase-locking or mode-locking in the language of electronic circuits). Among other applications, the circle map has been used to study the dynamical behaviour of a beating heart.|$|E
25|$|The {{received}} {{signal is}} now processed by the demodulator stage where the audio signal (or other baseband signal) is recovered and then further amplified. AM demodulation requires the simple rectification of the RF signal (so-called envelope detection), {{and a simple}} RC low pass filter to remove remnants of the intermediate frequency. FM signals may be detected using a discriminator, ratio detector, or <b>phase-locked</b> <b>loop.</b> Continuous wave (Morse code) and single sideband signals require a product detector using a so-called beat frequency oscillator, {{and there are other}} techniques used for different types of modulation. The resulting audio signal (for instance) is then amplified and drives a loudspeaker.|$|E

2500|$|Keeping {{the input}} and output phase in lock step also implies keeping the {{input and output}} {{frequencies}} the same. Consequently, in addition to synchronizing signals, a <b>phase-locked</b> <b>loop</b> can track an input frequency, or it can generate a frequency that is a multiple of the input frequency.

2500|$|A <b>phase-locked</b> <b>loop</b> or {{phase lock}} loop {{abbreviated}} as PLL is a control system that generates an output signal whose phase {{is related to the}} phase of an input signal. [...] There are several different types; the simplest is an electronic circuit consisting of a variable frequency oscillator and a phase detector in a feedback loop. [...] The oscillator generates a periodic signal, and the phase detector compares the phase of that signal with the phase of the input periodic signal, adjusting the oscillator to keep the phases matched.|$|E

40|$|Substantial {{evidence}} supports {{a relationship between}} gait perception and gait synthesis. Furthermore, passive mechanical systems demonstrate that the jointed leg systems of humans have innate oscillations that form a gait. These observations suggest that systems may perceive gaits by synchronizing an internal oscillating model to observed oscillations. We present such a system in this paper that uses <b>phase-locked</b> <b>loops</b> to synchronize an internal oscillator with oscillations from a video source. Arrays of <b>phase-locked</b> <b>loops,</b> called video <b>phase-locked</b> <b>loops,</b> synchronize a system with the oscillations in pixel intensities. We then test {{the perception of the}} resulting synchronized-oscillator model in various gait recognition tasks. Tools based on Procrustes analysis and directional statistics provide the computational mechanism to compare patterns of oscillations. We discuss the possibility of an alternative model for motion perception based on synchronization with the transient oscillations of temporal band-pass filters that is consistent with other proposed models for human perception. Synchronization of a kinematic model to oscillations also suggests a path {{to bridge the gap between}} the model-free and model-based domains...|$|R

2500|$|Earliest {{research}} towards {{what was}} later named the <b>phase-locked</b> <b>loop</b> {{goes back to}} 1932, when British researchers developed an alternative to Edwin Armstrong's superheterodyne receiver, the Homodyne or direct-conversion receiver. In the homodyne or synchrodyne system, a local oscillator was tuned to the desired input frequency and multiplied with the input signal. The resulting output signal included the original modulation information. [...] The intent was to develop an alternative receiver circuit that required fewer tuned circuits than the superheterodyne receiver. [...] Since the local oscillator would rapidly drift in frequency, an automatic correction signal {{was applied to the}} oscillator, maintaining it in the same phase and frequency of the desired signal. The technique was described in 1932, in a paper by Henri de Bellescize, in the French journal L'Onde Électrique.|$|E

[...] Software implementation has several advantages including easy customization of the feedback loop including changing the multiplication or division ratio between the signal being tracked and the output oscillator. [...] Furthermore, a software implementation is useful to understand and experiment with. [...] As an example of a <b>phase-locked</b> <b>loop</b> implemented using a phase frequency detector is presented in MATLAB, as this type of phase detector is robust and easy to implement. [...] This example uses integer arithmetic rather than floating point, as such an example is likely more useful in practice.|$|E
