40|$|It {{has been}} shown that the {{incubation}} of human plasma with urokinase at a concentration sufficient to cause rapid lysis of the clots formed on the addition of thrombin does not give rise to the production of measurable concentrations of non-clottable fibrinogen <b>breakdown</b> <b>products.</b> Also, <b>breakdown</b> <b>products</b> could not be detected in the course of experiments in vivo when urokinase was administered to monkeys and only in very low concentrations when a fibrinolytic state was induced by exercise in three healthy human volunteers. In contrast, high concentrations of <b>breakdown</b> <b>products</b> were found after thrombin infusion into monkeys...|$|R
50|$|Peroxide curing {{is widely}} used for curing {{silicone}} rubber. The curing process leaves behind byproducts, which can {{be an issue in}} food contact and medical applications. However, these products are usually treated in a postcure oven which greatly reduces the peroxide <b>breakdown</b> <b>product</b> content. One of the two main peroxides used, dicumyl peroxide, has principal <b>breakdown</b> <b>products</b> of acetophenone and phenyl-2-propanol. The other is dichlorobenzoyl peroxide, whose principal <b>breakdown</b> <b>products</b> are dichlorobenzoic acid and dichlorobenzene.|$|R
50|$|In project management, a <b>product</b> <b>breakdown</b> {{structure}} (PBS) is a {{tool for}} analysing, documenting and communicating the outcomes of a project, and forms part of the product based planning technique.|$|E
50|$|The PFD is {{typically}} created iteratively with Product Descriptions and the <b>Product</b> <b>Breakdown</b> Structure {{because as a}} project manager works through the logic they will identify missing products and additional information about products.|$|E
50|$|The Product {{flow diagram}} (PFD) is a {{graphical}} {{representation of the}} order by which a sequence of products is created according to Product based planning principles. It {{is related to the}} <b>Product</b> <b>breakdown</b> structure (PBS).|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} case of a hematic cyst and review the {{literature}} in order to clarify nomenclature discrepancies regarding terms used to describe cysts containing blood and blood <b>breakdown</b> <b>products</b> in and around the orbit. We believe orbital cysts containing blood and blood <b>breakdown</b> <b>products</b> should be separated into two major categories depending on {{the presence or absence of}} an epithelial or endothelial lining. A hemorrhage into a preexisting lesion such as a dermoid, on lymphangioma, which contains blood <b>breakdown</b> <b>products</b> lined by an endothelial or epithelial lining, should be referred to as an acute or chronic hematoma in a dermoid or lymphangioma. In contrast, a hematic cyst contains blood <b>breakdown</b> <b>products</b> and has no epithelial or endothelial lining but rather a fibrous pseudocapsule...|$|R

50|$|Several {{concepts}} {{are related to}} the subject of product structure modeling. All these {{concepts are}} discussed in this section. These concepts are divided into two main aspects. First the <b>product</b> <b>breakdown</b> is discussed which involves all the physical aspects of a product. Second, different views at the product structure are indicated.|$|E
5000|$|Product-based {{planning}} {{is intended to}} ensure that all of the necessary products are identified and captured, and begins by identifying a <b>product</b> <b>breakdown</b> structure which is then repeatedly refined until all of the requisite products are identified. The PBS is thus a hierarchical family tree of all the products and sub-products that comprise the final end-product.|$|E
50|$|The matrix is {{typically}} created with a vertical axis (left-hand column) of tasks (e.g., from a {{work breakdown structure}} WBS) or deliverables (e.g., from a <b>product</b> <b>breakdown</b> structure PBS), and a horizontal axis (top row) of roles (e.g., from an organizational chart) - as illustrated in the image of an example responsibility assignment (or RACI) matrix.|$|E

5000|$|Once a <b>product</b> <b>breakdown</b> {{structure}} has been created, work can then begin on creating a product flow diagram (PFD) (or product flowchart) which identifies {{the order of}} precedence of products and will typically include multiple and complex parallel paths. For practical purposes this flowchart {{is essentially the same}} as the PERT chart used for critical path scheduling and leads naturally {{to the development of a}} project schedule.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{important}} to understand that in this context the term 'product' includes intermediate documentary products that are essential to the work of delivering the project. In this sense the <b>product</b> <b>breakdown</b> structure is a great deal more than simply an exploded view of the final end-product. Products included might also be products required to manage the project such as paper-based products and quality products such as approvals or quality checks on earlier made products. Examples include such things as requirement specifications, design approvals, test documentation, safety certifications, and so on.|$|E
50|$|To {{improve the}} sales of the {{convertible}}, Lincoln added a glass rear window to the convertible top and improved the hydraulic system for opening the top and trunklid by adding a second pump, separating the two systems; the hydraulic solenoids were also removed from the car as well. To lure potential Cadillac buyers, 1966 Continental prices were reduced almost US$600 without reducing equipment levels. It succeeded, helping boost sales to 54,755 that year, an increase of 36%, all of it due to the new two-door; sales of both four-door models slipped slightly. <b>Product</b> <b>breakdown</b> for the year consisted of 65% sedans, 29% coupes, and just under 6% for the four-door convertible.|$|E

5000|$|... the PFD is a {{planning}} aid, not {{an outcome of}} planning (like a PERT Chart which looks similar), {{this is a common}} cause of confusion among the project managers- the PFD should contain all of the products of the <b>Product</b> <b>Breakdown</b> Structure (equivalent to a Work Breakdown Structure)- the PFD should be kept as simple/ high-level as possible for it to make sense (if additional detail is required, creating a supplementary, detailed PFD can be useful)- all products should be 'linked into' the PFD, even if it's only to the start and the finish products- it's vital not to get too 'hung up' on nuances such as the nature of each logical linkage in setting up a PFD ...|$|E
50|$|Specifying the {{importance}} of the project, Project Initiation Documentation identifies that it is the contract between the project management and sponsor. The aim of PID is understanding the premises of the project. The correct format of PID represents the understanding of the background, objectives and benefits. A good project manager is not only interested in delivering an output or a capability to their customer, but interested in the wider context and the benefits that this capability will ultimately bring about. PID identifies what is in scope within the project with the use of flow diagrams and <b>Product</b> <b>Breakdown</b> Structures. The pivotal role plays the identification of responsibilities, which implies roles of project manager, team leader, sponsor, supplier, user representative, stakeholders and members of steering committee.|$|E
5000|$|Optimal {{maintenance}} is the discipline within operations research concerned with maintaining {{a system in}} a manner that maximizes profit or minimizes cost. Cost functions depending on the reliability, availability and maintainability characteristics of the system of interest determine the parameters to minimize. Parameters often considered are the cost of failure, the cost per time unit of [...] "downtime" [...] (for example: revenue losses), the cost (per time unit) of corrective maintenance, the cost per time unit of preventive maintenance and the cost of repairable system replacement and Pohl. The foundation of any maintenance model relies on the correct description of the underlying deterioration process and failure behavior of the component, and on the relationships between maintained components in the <b>product</b> <b>breakdown</b> (system / sub-system / assembly / sub-assembly...).|$|E

50|$|Figure 1 {{illustrates}} the concepts {{that are important}} to the structure of a product. This is a meta-data model, which can be used for modeling the instances in a specific case of product structuring.The core of the product structure is illustrated by the product components (s) and their relationships. Thus, this involves the linking between items related to the product.The assembly can consist of subassemblies and parts, whereas subassemblies can also consist of other subassemblies or part. Thus this is typically hierarchically ordered. These concepts are generalized into the concept of item. This classification is overlapping, because a subassembly could be a part in another assembly configuration.Due to differentiation and variation of items several concepts must be indicated into the <b>product</b> <b>breakdown</b> structure. Three concepts are involved in this differentiation, namely alternatives, variants and revisions. An alternative of an item is considered as a substitute for that particular item, whereas a variant is another option of an item which the consumer can choose. When an error occurs at a part or subassembly, it needs to be revised. This revision indicates the change history of the item.|$|E
50|$|If {{the work}} {{breakdown}} structure designer attempts to capture any action-oriented details in the WBS, the designer will likely include either too many actions or too few actions. Too many actions will exceed 100% of the parent's scope and too few will fall short of 100% of the parent's scope. The best way {{to adhere to the}} 100% rule is to define WBS elements in terms of outcomes or results, not actions. This also ensures that the WBS is not overly prescriptive of methods, allowing for greater ingenuity and creative thinking {{on the part of the}} project participants. For new product development projects, the most common technique to ensure an outcome-oriented WBS is to use a <b>product</b> <b>breakdown</b> structure. Feature-driven software projects may use a similar technique which is to employ a feature breakdown structure. When a project provides professional services, a common technique is to capture all planned deliverables to create a deliverable-oriented WBS. Work breakdown structures that subdivide work by project phases (e.g. preliminary design phase, critical design phase) must ensure that phases are clearly separated by a deliverable also used in defining entry and exit criteria (e.g. an approved preliminary or critical design review).|$|E
40|$|The <b>Product</b> <b>Breakdown</b> Structure is {{traditionally}} {{a method of}} identification of the products of a project in a tree structure. It is a tool used to assess, plan, document, and display the equipment requirements for a project. It {{is part of a}} product based planning technique, and attempts to break down all components of a project in as much detail as possible, so that nothing is overlooked. The PBS for ground systems at the Kennedy Space Center is being developed to encompass the traditional requirements including the alignment of facility, systems, and components to the organizational hierarchy. The Ground Operations <b>Product</b> <b>Breakdown</b> Structure is a hybrid in nature in that some aspects of a work breakdown structure will be incorporated and merged with the Architecture Concept of Operations, Master Subsystem List, customer interface, and assigned management responsibility. The Ground Operations <b>Product</b> <b>Breakdown</b> Structure {{needs to be able to}} identify the flexibility of support differing customers (internal and external) usage of ground support equipment within the Kennedy Space Center launch and processing complex. The development of the <b>Product</b> <b>Breakdown</b> Structure is an iterative activity Initially documenting the organization hierarchy structure and relationships. The <b>Product</b> <b>Breakdown</b> Structure identifies the linkage between the customer program requirements, allocation of system resources, development of design goals, and identification logistics products. As the <b>Product</b> <b>Breakdown</b> Structure progresses the incorporation of the results of requirement planning for the customer occurs identifying facility needs and systems. The mature <b>Product</b> <b>Breakdown</b> Structure is baselined with a hierarchical drawing, the <b>Product</b> <b>Breakdown</b> Structure database, and an associated document identifying the verification of the data through the life cycle of the program/product line. This paper will document, demonstrate, and identify key aspects of the life cycle of a Hybrid <b>Product</b> <b>Breakdown</b> Structure. The purpose is to show how a project management and system engineering approach can be utilized for providing flexible customer service in an evolving manned space flight launch processing environment...|$|E
