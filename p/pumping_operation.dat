The comparison of results shows that the optimisation of variable speed pumps can lead to more effective pump controls, especially when the demand variability is larger.

Heat load {{in excess of the}} design limit, uncontrolled chemical reactions, chronic toxic gas releases, foaming, and erosion and corrosion have been shown not to be safety concerns. The effect of <b>pump</b> <b>operation</b> on future GREs could not be quantified. The problem with evaluating the long-term effects of <b>pump</b> <b>operation</b> on GREs is a lack of knowledge and uncertainty. In particular, the phenomena governing gas retention, particle size distribution, and settling are not well understood, nor are the interactions among these factors understood. There is a possibility that changes in these factors could increase the size of future GREs. Bounding estimates of the potential increase in size of GREs are not possible {{because of a lack of}} engineering data. Proper management of the hazards can reduce, but not eliminate, the possibility of undesirable changes. Maintaining temperature within the historical limits can reduce the possibility of undesirable changes.

40|$|AbstractOptimal pump {{scheduling}} {{is a major}} consideration {{when dealing}} with minimizing operational costs of a water distribution system. <b>Pump</b> <b>operation</b> must balance between three factors. Water balance constraints, including consumer demand and water tank volumes. Hydraulic constraints determining water pump operating point. Electrical tariff rate effecting energy cost. Optimization models may assume linear or discrete <b>pump</b> <b>operation,</b> depending on type and accuracy of the model in use. Linear <b>operation</b> assumes the <b>pump</b> may operate during {{part of the time}} step while discrete <b>operation</b> requires the <b>pump</b> to be either on or off during the entire time step. Linear optimization models commonly have short solution times, but cannot contain non-linear constraints such as hydraulic headloss. By such, linear model results may be difficult to implement in a real water system as the hydraulic behavior of the system may render the optimal solution impractical. Likewise, if the <b>pump</b> <b>operation</b> partially uses the time step the pump may be forced to come in and out of duty often causing mechanical ware and tare. Discrete <b>operation</b> provides smooth <b>pump</b> <b>operation</b> and may contain non-linear hydraulic constraint to calculate a more realistic working point for the pump. Discrete models have long solution times due the vast amount of pump operating combinations, which must be explored. Heuristic techniques may be used to shorten solution times but these do not assure global minimization of the solution. The goal of the research is to create a minimum cost optimal operation water distribution system model that utilizes the short solution time of a linear model but also includes non-linear hydraulic constraints effecting pump energy consumption and discrete <b>pump</b> <b>operation.</b> The motivation is to use the model for real-time pump scheduling and for water system design...|$|R
