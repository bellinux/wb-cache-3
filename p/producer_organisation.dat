In Hungary, POs have been accounting for bigger share of fruit and vegetable trading in Hungary, which refers to a better organisation in the sector. Bargaining force and level of experience on running such businesses, although, are still much behind the level expected. Flexibility and speed of a running business are highly determined by the legal form of Pos. The most favourite form is cooperative that is not flexible enough as a business form, especially for starting businesses. Low yearly turnover and weak market power feature the POs, preferring short time solutions to strategic thinking.

40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} Cepicafé, a Fairtrade/organic coffee <b>producer</b> <b>organisation</b> in Piura, Peru. It {{discusses}} the contributions made to empowerment of the members, and identifies {{some of the}} obstacles to participation and empowerment, both within the organisation and outside. Small-scale coffee producers often {{find themselves in a}} vulnerable and disempowered position in relation to the world market. The Fairtrade and organic market initiatives focus on improving trade relations and demanding social, economic and environmental standards in production. They only work with organised producers, hence my subject for the analysis is a <b>producer</b> <b>organisation.</b> Cepicafé's aim is sustainable development, improving quality of life and eradication poverty among small-scale producers in Piura. This will involve a process of empowerment, as poverty is also considered to be powerlessness and voicelessness. The theoretical, conceptual and analytical foundation for this thesis is concerned with empowerment through participation and collective action. Empowerment is seen to be a process which involves enabling social, political and psychological power. Power {{is considered to be a}} fluid concept and actors are seen to hold varying degrees of these powers, relative to the time, place and relations they find themselves in. The ultimate goal is collective empowerment. This involves participation aimed at achieving radical change in the producers' circumstances. Hence, there is a need to include political claims and confront forces outside of the organisation. Cepicafé's role in a multi-levelled, global/local network presents a great potential for this. The empirical data aims at showing the research participants' multiple realities. Knowledge is produced through interviews, observation and informal conversations with coffee producers and staff in Cepicafé during a two months long field work in Piura, Peru in 2007. The analysis looks at firstly the services provided by Cepicafé as a way of strengthening social power. Commercialisation, credit support, and technical assistance and knowledge transfers are the main functional areas through with support is given. However, as the producers in the organisation are a heterogeneous group with reference to agency and socio-economic status, both perceived and actual benefits vary. Second, information flows and knowledge transfers related to decision-making as well as the fluidity of power relations amongst actors is put under scrutiny in order to understand the producers' access to participation and political power, which is an important step towards empowerment. The mentioned heterogeneity, a lack of understanding of issues related to Fairtrade and the market, as well as existing power relations between the actors at the local level are seen to affect the ability to participate in decisionmaking. The organisation seems also to mainly focus on service provision, and does not really engage in political advocacy. There is a need to consolidate the efforts among the different levels in the multi-levelled network that Cepicafé is a part of, in order to also include the producers in this struggle. </p...|$|E

40|$|The National Farmers Federation (NFF) is a peak <b>producer</b> <b>organisation.</b> Its {{executive}} has {{purported to}} represent all Australian farmers with a unified voice. This thesis argues that primary producers are too heterogeneous a group {{ever to have}} developed much solidarity in articulation of or action for the furtherance of common interests and that this fact {{is reflected in the}} NFF. Heterogeneity results from farm size, product specialisation, level of technology adopted, geographical location and special needs. Successive farm organisations and the National Party (and predecessors) have attempted to encompass these differences since the 1890 s. Producer differences either have led to secession or to unification when political and economic circumstances have warranted it. This diversity has prevented farm groups becoming united. The lack of unity at first prevented all farmers joining in one organisation, and when they did, they kept on splitting up. The charisma of Ian McLachlan allowed farmers to get together, but the diversity meant that the getting together benefited some not only without the others, but sometimes at the expense of others. This thesis explores the heterogeneity of the agricultural sector within the political and economic context of Australian agriculture and discusses its consequences, in the constant re-forming of farm organisations and the institutional framework of the NFF in the context of politicisation of agricultural interest groups. This thesis concludes that producer differences in terms of size and product specialisation determine how effectively they are represented. Corporate farmers have fared much better than family and family-plus farmers, who would probably be better represented by a small business organisation, with which they have more in common, rather than a farming organisation...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to examine}} how family farm viability, sustainability and resilience can be enhanced through co-operation. Family farm survival {{is considered to be}} largely determined by economic viability, however, aspects of sustainability and resilience also prove influential. Family farms, through various resilience strategies such as co-operation, can achieve viability and sustainability in novel ways. The co-operative is a longstanding business model within the agricultural industry, facilitating members to collectively improve their incomes by creating economies of scale; gaining market access; developing and creating new products and ideas, among other objectives. Given the particularly poor economic viability of Irish beef farmers, <b>Producer</b> <b>Organisation</b> (PO) legislation, largely based on co-operative model principles and guidelines, has been introduced in a direct attempt to enhance farm-level viability by rebalancing power in the supply chain. Other current policy objectives seek to increase the value of Irish beef. Therefore, this research focuses on a distinct values-based co-operative approach which incorporates aspects of both scale and product differentiation for application in the Irish beef context. Data collection was conducted in two main stages. Firstly, an in-depth qualitative case study of a US values-based co-operative model was carried out to investigate its operations, benefits and challenges. Secondly, research was carried out to assess the appetite for such an approach in the Irish beef context, drawing on in-depth interviews and an analysis of stakeholder submissions. Findings from the research reveal that a values-based co-operative approach can greatly enhance farm-level viability, sustainability and resilience. Lessons, practical issues and considerations are highlighted to inform how future Irish beef POs should be established both organisationally and structurally. Drawing on lessons from the case study and views expressed by stakeholders, a theoretical blueprint is presented for implementing a values-based cooperative approach in the Irish beef context...|$|E
40|$|Whilst {{there have}} been many {{accounts}} of success stories of fair trade in a variety of low income producer communities, {{there have been}} few critical accounts that examine the varied lived experiences of people in such communities. This thesis advances a developing critical literature by exploring reasons for unequal and uneven experiences of members of a Fairtrade certified <b>producer</b> <b>organisation.</b> As fair trade has expanded into new commodities and countries, both sugar and Malawi have to date been underresearched. This thesis addresses these gaps by focussing on Kasinthula Cane Growers Limited (KCGL) in southern Malawi. Developing a critical reflection that incorporates postcolonial and post-Marxist critiques, the thesis problematises definitions and assumptions regarding empowerment as a people-centred development approach and community as a cooperative social and political formation. This reflection is used to expand existing analytical frameworks to create a Postcolonial Agricultural Production Network as a framework to focus on a complex geography embedded in a local postcolonial production place. Doing so opens space to explore uneven geographies of production and empowerment shaped by embedded social and political factors. By un-masking inequalities, hierarchies, and dependencies in the institutional environment of a producer community, and incorporating perspectives from a range of producers, both intended and unintended outcomes from Fairtrade certification are examined. The thesis reveals that despite fair trade intentions to promote democracy, transparency, and participation, unintended consequences of exacerbating inequalities and discrepancies between low income producers, and over expectations of an impoverished society, have led to variable experiences of fair trade. Identifying sites of local inequality and unable and unwilling agents of empowerment highlights the important role of place in analysis. This demonstrates how embedded social and political formations in a particular place shape different experiences of fair trade. The findings propose a lesson to incorporate a more nuanced understanding of place in fair trade approaches that challenge assumptions of harmonious producer communities to sharpen focus on embedded inequalities and uneven producer community landscapes.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{an account of}} the way in which meaning associated with the term ‘fair trade’ is negotiated within a number of discrete, yet interrelated communities, in a way which influences stakeholder understanding of the concept – and as a result, structures the way in which public procurement strategies integrate fair trade governance into their operation. Building from the identification of ‘fair trade’ governance as a means to embed the intra-generational social justice concerns of sustainable development within the public procurement system, the thesis investigates how the ambiguous meaning of fair trade is reconciled in discourse and practice. Specifically focusing on the case study of Scotland – where Local Authorities are involved in a complex network of state and private governance initiatives – investigation reveals that despite various influences to the contrary, fair trade is strongly conflated with certification administered by the dominant global fair trade certifying body, Fairtrade International (FLO). However, exceptions are argued to demonstrate an active negotiation of this domination over meaning. In particular, one Authority has purchased ‘fairly traded’ Kilombero rice – produced by members of the National Smallholder Farmers Association of Malawi (NASFAM) – as part of its fair trade strategy, by accepting claims of fairness not on the basis of external certification, but on trust from a socially orientated import organisation. Extending the study along the supply chain, investigation reveals that while the <b>producer</b> <b>organisation</b> sees fair trade as beneficial to their overall objectives, they identify significant limitations with the FLO approach. For this reason they have pursued World Fair Trade Organisation (WFTO) accreditation in order to back their claims to fair trade operation. As such, the dominance of FLO certification is seen to be actively contested as part of a wider dynamic in which different approaches vie to influence the understanding, and therefore the praxis of stakeholders.

30|$|Consequently, the {{analysis}} of the price transmission has showed that antitrust intervention would seem have produced some substantial effects in the Italian pasta market by restoring a state of high competition among companies. This result is in line with part of the previous literature (Sabbatini 2008) on the effectiveness of authority intervention on markets in which collusion among firms is investigated and fined. However, among the reasons which could have pushed firms to a higher competition, {{it is important to consider}} that in the last years, as suggested by Cacchiarelli, Lass and Sorrentino (2016), in Italian pasta supply chain the role played by retailers is decisively more important. In fact, retailers, entering pasta market through private labels, have improved their bargaining power toward pasta makers. Based on the last sentences, it is worthwhile to briefly underline the importance of competition law in the food supply chain which connects sectors with a very articulated structure. The agricultural sector is characterized by highly fragmented production while the market structure in processing and retailing stages is much more concentrated (EU 2009; Russo et al. 2011). This often allows processors and retailers to exert their potential market power to extract rent from government interventions sustaining farmers by different forms of subsidies (Russo et al. 2011; Sexton 2013). Therefore, for an effective antitrust policy it is crucial both the monitoring activities of antitrust authority and the measures of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) which can be successful in rebalancing the market power among the sectors of the agro-food chains. In effect, although national antitrust authorities can intervene, as we demonstrated in this paper, by restoring a state of competition among companies this is not sufficient to prevent anti-competitive conducts. This goal can be reached through a policy which might improve the bargaining power of farmers. In this direction, we consider very useful the measures of the 2013 CAP Reform to strengthen and extend the role for <b>Producer</b> <b>Organisation</b> and Interbrunch Organisation in all agricultural sectors for their capability to concentrate producers’ supply and provide alternative marketing channels with more balanced contracts and transactions.|$|E
40|$|Review of EU {{subsidies}} in {{the fruit}} and vegetable sector Although {{the fruit and}} vegetable sector is not formally part of the CAP mid-term review, it is proposed to replace {{the current system of}} support through producer organisations and export refunds with an annual flat-rate payment of € 100 per hectare for a maximum guaranteed area of 800, 000 hectares, divided into national guaranteed areas. This could be topped up by an annual maximum amount of € 109 per hectare by member states. This USDA briefing points out that since the start of marketing year 2000 / 01 aid for fruit and vegetables intended for processing have been paid directly to the producer organisations and no longer to the processors and that as a consequence the new arrangements have made the fixing of a minimum price obsolete. In 2003 production aid to processed tomatoes is set at € 279 million a 25 % increase over 2001, while aid for processing fruit-based products is set at € 86 million, a 21 % increase over 2001, and aid for citrus fruit is set at € 249 million, a 46. 5 % increase over 2001. It should be noted that fruit processors may also be eligible for support under EU rural-development programmes. However these programmes are non-product specific and it is therefore impossible to determine the level of support being extended to specific types of processors under these programmes. The briefing also notes that fruit and vegetable grower may also benefit from member states' aid measures (e. g. the greenhouse sector in the Netherlands). The EU also grants financial support for the promotion of EU agricultural products, including fruit and vegetables on the internal market and third-country markets, with such promotional measures being part-financed by the EU (50 %), part by the member states (20 %) and part by the <b>producer</b> <b>organisation</b> (30 %).

40|$|The role of {{producer}} {{organizations in}} market chains has received increasing attention in recent years, both from governments and donors. In order to lower transaction costs, markets demand that smallholder farmers operate {{in an organized}} manner. However, though the policy openings for support seem promising, smallholder market access through farmer-led economic organisations is not easy. This book presents various approaches to support <b>producer</b> <b>organisations</b> in terms of providing economic services to their members, {{with a focus on}} developing countries. Markets are increasingly fragmented in value chains that link farmers with specific processors, retailers and consumer segments. Several contributions in this book analyse these dynamics in specific value chains, such as the fair trade and organic agriculture and their potential to provide market outlets for smallholder farmers. The sixteen contributions in the book are organized in three sections: - organisational support for producer organisations; - value chain development with producer organisations; - changes in the institutional environment for <b>producer</b> <b>organisations.</b> This book {{is the result of a}} Dutch partnership between policy makers, researchers and practitioners designed to confront ideas with realities. Organized in a platform called Agri-ProFocus, members aim to provide more and better support to <b>producer</b> <b>organisations</b> in the South. Through so-called expert meetings, staff from donor organisations and knowledge centres, government officials, and business representatives, share their experiences and lessons learned.
