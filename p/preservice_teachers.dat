40|$|Abstract: This is a {{research}} paper describing the impact of globalisation on the provision of <b>preservice</b> <b>teacher</b> education in Western Australia. The author utilises a range of research methodologies to gather and analyse current data, finally a range of possible futuristic scenarios are presented. The paper has significance for those concerned with future policy and planning {{in the area of}} <b>preservice</b> <b>teacher</b> education yet has a broader impact for all educational planners. It is written {{from the perspective of a}} concerned tertiary educator with over twenty-five years experience in education. The author currently co-ordinates a post-graduate course in <b>preservice</b> <b>teacher</b> education at a university in Western Australia. We need to understand the nature of growth processes and how to catalyse them. But we also need to understand the forces and challenges that impede progress, and to develop workable strategies for dealing with these challenges. We need to understand the dance of change, the inevitable interplay between growth processes and limiting processes (Senge, 2001. pp. 11.). In this paper I make connections between the current resources boom in Western Australia and <b>preservice</b> <b>teacher</b> education. I begin by portraying the Resources boom as a direct consequence of globalisation, and then proceed to notice how this economic boom is impacting on <b>preservice</b> <b>teacher</b> education. Following this, problems and dilemmas in <b>preservice</b> <b>teacher</b> education will be presented and the roles played by state and federal government in encouraging enrolments and providing resources for teacher education courses will be critiqued. Finally, forecasting models will be used to create a range of scenarios for the future provision of <b>preservice</b> <b>teacher</b> education in WA...|$|R

50|$|The Chief Commissioner of Scouts Victoria, Mr Brendan J Watson OAM, as an {{educator}} and Principal, understood {{the value of the}} Scout Leader Training program and the experience that being a volunteer leader in the movement could provide for students studying teaching degrees at tertiary level. In 2015, Monash University partnered with Scouts Victoria to implement the trial Quality Teacher Program which would see undergraduate 2nd year (of 4-year course) teaching students sign up in pairs as leaders within Scout Groups. The experience of planning, delivering, assessing and providing feedback on the content delivered and undertaken {{in the course of a}} usual Scout Meeting each week provided these <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> with additional experiences as well as the opportunity to work with young people, manage behaviours, provide support and engage with families. The experience and training provided by Scouting to these <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> also covered Duty of Care, Risk Assessment and Management, practical experience in planning, organising, running and evaluating camps, excursions, events, carnivals, and other out of school activities that most student teachers never have the opportunity to learn on teaching rounds. The Quality Teacher Program designed by Chief Commissioner Scouts Victoria, Brendan J Watson OAM, saw 25 Groups have leaders placed in their ranks in the first round of placements with subsequent placements to follow. Brendan Watson OAM had stated that the experience over three years would see these undergraduate teachers go into schools as graduate teachers with the skills and experience of a teacher that had been working ins schools for 3-5 years. The quality of teacher preparation is often scrutinised but in 2015, Scouts Victoria established the program that could improve the quality of teacher preparation with the goal being to improve student outcomes and engagement across the State in all school sectors. Scouts Australia have committed to implementing the Scouts Victoria programs throughout the other Branches seeing the initiatives as innovative, ground breaking and creative. Serving both Scouting and the entire education sector, the Quality Teacher Program struggled to gain traction initially and sadly did not receive any response from the government. Regardless, Scouts Victoria forged ahead with positive results being seen almost immediately.|$|E

40|$|In this research, {{the reasons}} of preservice teachers’ {{choice of the}} {{teaching}} profession has been studied using the method of pair-wise comparison.

40|$|This {{qualitative}} {{study focused on}} the development of reflective practice with <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> through a framework during an early field experience. The framework provided an explicit structure for the <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> to investigate four focus areas (teachers role, active learning, culture, and assessment). The <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> explored a focus area, dialogued via e-mail with a peer, and then discussed their findings in small groups. The <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> were given a pre and post survey that queried them about their beliefs related to the four focus areas and the concept of reflection. Content analysis of the explanatory statements on the survey, dialogue e-mails and written reflections after small group discussions, and focus group interviews guided a systematic examination of the data. The dialogue e-mails and written reflections were also analyzed using a rubric for reflective levels. The survey results indicated that while a substantial number of <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> maintained the same belief after experiencing the framework of inquiry into practice, an equal or greater number of <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> changed. These <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> became more student-focused as the semester progressed. They also became increasingly self-critical of their own teaching practices which led them to alternative approaches. Consequently, these <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> were able to articulate their beliefs in the context of teaching. The structure of the framework provided opportunities for the <b>preservice</b> <b>teachers</b> to rehearse reflective practice; thus teacher educators have an explicit methodological model for developing reflective practitioners.
