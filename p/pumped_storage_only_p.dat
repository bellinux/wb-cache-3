40|$|For {{many years}} energy {{optimization}} {{has dealt with}} large scale mixed integer linear programs. The paper concentrates on programs that are used for controlling an existing generation system consisting of thermal power units and <b>pumped</b> hydro <b>storage</b> plants, therefore they should be solved in real time. The problem can be decomposed into smaller problems using Lagrangian Relaxation. One of these problems is still a large scale multistage problem and it handles with <b>pumped</b> hydro <b>storage</b> plants <b>only.</b> In this paper, this problem is investigated down to the smallest details. The objective function for this problem is a linear function but stochastic. Using the special structure of the constraints, a solution method based on a subset of descent directions was developed. This method was compared with an available standard software for multistage linear programs...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} adding two {{powdered}} spices (rosemary and thyme) on the pH, colour coordinates, Cooking yield (CY) Cooking loss (CL), Diameter Reduction (DR), Shear Force (SF), microbiological levels and lipid oxidation (LO) in {{two types of}} lamb burgers (L= leg meat; LNB= leg+neck+breast meat) was assessed over a six day period. Both spices increased stability during the storage period, LO values being six times {{lower than those of}} the non-spiced control group at 6 days. L samples showed higher CY, lower CL and DR than LNB burgers, with significant differences at 6 d (P < 0. 001). The length of <b>storage</b> <b>only</b> affected (<b>P</b> < 0. 01) these parameters in L burgers. In general, SF was higher in LNB than in L burgers but did not vary with time. The colour coordinates showed lower values in L than in LNB samples. The formulation type affected TVC and Pseudomonas spp...|$|R

If the object space is ordered, then sorting {{can be used to}} reduce the time complexity to the optimal B(nlogn). We then prove that weighted t-out-of-Ev; threshold voting on such an object space has time complexity O(np) and needs working <b>storage</b> space for <b>only</b> <b>p</b> objects, where p = L(Ev;) /tJ.

30|$|Many islands have {{abundant}} seawater <b>pumped</b> <b>storage</b> resources. According to {{the analysis}} of Hainan, et al. seawater <b>pumped</b> <b>storage</b> resources, these three coastal provinces have 81 sites that are suited {{for the construction of a}} seawater <b>pumped</b> <b>storage</b> system, 30 of which are islands [13]. It is necessary to select an island energy storage form through technical and economic analysis. In [12], the life cycle cost of a microgrid with different energy storage schemes (including battery <b>storage,</b> seawater <b>pumped</b> <b>storage</b> and hybrid energy storage systems) is analyzed under the condition of a given island microgrid with the necessary energy storage requirements. The results show that, in most cases, the cost of the <b>pumped</b> <b>storage</b> scheme is lower than that of the battery storage scheme, and the cost difference is related to factors such as the demand for energy storage and the rate of return on the investment of the assets.|$|R
40|$|In {{the recent}} years, {{the debate on}} the {{necessity}} of <b>pumped</b> <b>storage</b> systems in the Greek power supply system has started. In the current decade, the Greek power system will gradually try higher RES penetration, mainly due to wind energy and photovoltaics integration. Variability of wind and PV generation and the current structure of the Greek power system introduce technical constraints, which should be taken into consideration in the forthcoming large scale RES integration. This paper examines the ability of the Greek power system to absorb renewable power and the necessity of <b>pumped</b> <b>storage</b> systems. The feasibility of <b>pumped</b> <b>storage</b> systems is discussed in three different scenarios of wind-photovoltaics integration. Results show that for the gradual increase of variable output RES, <b>pumped</b> <b>storage</b> systems are required, but the feasibility of <b>pumped</b> <b>storage</b> systems is not proved in the intermediate scenarios of RES integration. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
