40|$|Nisin is a {{bacteriocin}} synthesized {{by certain}} species of Lactococcus lactis, {{that has been}} recently employed as a preservative in the food industry. Taking into account its potential as a natural preservative, its applicability in cosmetics and topical products was probed, aiming to replace or reduce the use of synthetic preservatives currently used in these products. In vitro susceptibility tests were performed using the plate diffusion method and the “Challenge Test”. The action of nisin was tested when applied alone and in synergy with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid tetrasodium salt (EDTA) and similar synthetic preservatives, Abiol® (INCI-Imidazolidinyl urea) and Microcare PM 2 (Phenoxyethanol, Ethylparaben, Methylparaben). The {{results of this study}} demonstrate that nisin is effective in inhibiting gram-positive microorganisms Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus sp. However, for other tested microorganisms, only the combination of nisin, EDTA and synthetic preservatives, respectively at 125 ppm/ 0. 1 / 0. 35 %, showed antimicrobial activity in compliance with criterion A from ISO 11930.

Five copper-based chemicals or zinc borate were blended into the aspen furnish at three retention levels. Tebuconazole or 4, 5 -dichloro- 2 -N-octyl- 4 -isothiazolin- 3 -one (DCOI) were added as cobiocides to selected copper-based treatments. Panels were inoculated with four common molds {{and subjected to}} high temperature and humidity for 8 wk according to AWPA Standard E 24. Most panels experienced extensive mold growth, but panels treated with DCOI had marked resistance to attack as did combinations of copper-based preservatives and DCOI.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to find natural spice and herb {{extracts}} with antibacterial and antioxidant capacities that could be potentially used as natural preservatives in raw pork. RESULTS: The inhibitory effects of cinnamon stick, oregano, clove, pomegranate peel and grape seed extracts on Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella enterica were evaluated in raw pork at room temperature (~ 20 °C). The influences of these extracts on lipid oxidation in the meat were also investigated. The pH, colour parameters and TBARS (thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances) values were tested periodically. The results showed that all five natural extracts, especially clove, were effective against the bacteria. During storage the colour parameters of the extract-treated pork samples changed slightly, in comparison with significant changes in the control. Treatments with these extracts increased the stability of raw pork against lipid oxidation. Clove was the most effective for retarding lipid oxidation and presented the highest antioxidant activity in raw pork. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the tested extracts, especially clove, have potential as natural <b>preservatives</b> to <b>reduce</b> numbers of pathogenic bacteria, colour degradation and lipid oxidation in raw pork. © 2009 Society of Chemical Industry. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2008 Copper {{migration}} from treated wood has created concerns within {{the environmental community}} {{because of the potential}} effects of this heavy metal on aquatic organisms. Migration can be limited, to some extent, by more controlled treatments and by post-treatment processing, but these actions cannot completely overcome the problem. An alternative approach to limit copper migration is to incorporate additives into the formulations that would either block or slow copper loss. Preliminary trials suggest that adding small amounts of Di(hydrogenated tallowalkyl) dimethyl ammonium chloride (2 HT), a common fabric softener, to the treating solution can reduce copper losses in service. Reducing copper losses may also allow the use of lower initial preservative loadings. In this research, the potential for using 2 HT was examined to reduce copper losses while maintaining preservative efficacy. The effect of the additive on leaching was assessed by soaking blocks in water over a 14 -day period, then examining the resulting leachate.

40|$|In {{terms of}} public health, {{childhood}} vaccination programs have benefits that far outweigh risks. However, some parents decide not to vaccinate their children. This paper explores {{the ways in which}} such parents talked about the perceived risks and benefits incurred by vaccinating (or not vaccinating) their children. Between 2013 - 2016 we undertook 29 in-depth interviews with non-vaccinating and/or 'vaccine hesitant' parents in Australia. Interviews were conducted in an open and non-judgmental manner, akin to empathic neutrality. Interviews focused on parents talking about the factors that shaped their decisions not to (or partially) vaccinate their children. All interviews were transcribed and analysed using both inductive and deductive processes. The main themes focus on parental perceptions of: 1. their capacity to reason; 2. their rejection of Western medical epistemology; and 3. their participation in labour intensive parenting practices (which we term salutogenic parenting). Parents engaged in an ongoing search for information about how best to parent their children (capacity to reason), which for many led to questioning/distrust of traditional scientific knowledge (rejection of Western medical epistemology). Salutogenic parenting spontaneously arose in interviews, whereby parents practised health promoting activities which they saw as boosting the natural immunity of their children and protecting them from illness (reducing or negating the perceived need for vaccinations). Salutogenic parenting practices included breastfeeding, eating organic and/or home-grown food, cooking from scratch to <b>reduce</b> <b>preservative</b> consumption and <b>reducing</b> exposure to toxins. We interpret our data as a 'logic of care', which is seen by parents as internally consistent, logically inter-related and inter-dependent.

Methods: Forty-eight rabbits (aged 4 months, body weight approximate to 3 kg) were randomized into four groups (n= 12). They were examined with electroretinography (ERG) prior to drug exposure, and then injected intravitreally with a combination of TA and BA, TA without BA, BA alone or a balanced saline solution (BSS). The electroretinograms were assessed 1 week and 7 weeks post-injection. The rabbits were euthanized and the sectioned retinas were studied. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on rods, cones, rod bipolar cells, horizontal cells, amacrine cells and Muller cells. Results: Rabbits injected with BA showed a significantly lower rod-mediated b-wave amplitude than the controls 1 week after injection. TA-injected rabbits demonstrated significantly higher a- and b-wave amplitudes in the total retinal response than the controls 1 week post-injection. The rabbits injected with TA+BA demonstrated a significantly higher b-wave amplitude in the total retinal response than the controls 1 week after injection. The significantly higher a-wave amplitude in the total retinal response remained in the TA-injected rabbits 7 weeks after injection. Immunohistochemistry revealed that protein kinase C alpha (PKC alpha) was down-regulated in both the perikarya and the axons of bipolar cells in histological sections from rabbit retina injected with TA+BA, BA and TA. Conclusions: Intravitreal injection of the <b>preservative</b> BA <b>reduces</b> the isolated rod-mediated retinal response in the rabbit, transiently and selectively.

The chemical and microbiological analyses showed that the application of the coating in cheese samples can be used to decrease the water loss and the colour changes during the storage time. The presence of the coating decreased the moisture loss of the cheese in 2. 5 % and 1. 9 %, and the weight loss in 3. 8 % and 3. 1 % at 4 °C and 20 °C, respectively. Also, the hardness of the cheese can be decreased {{as a result of the}} interaction of the presence of the coating with changes in the storing temperature. In the studied range (4 – 20 °C) temperature has a statistically significant effect in moisture loss, colour change, hardness and total mesophilic bacterial growth. Overall, galactomannan coating can be used to improve “Regional” cheese shelf-life as it decreases RO 2 and RCO 2, improves its weight and appearance and can be used to incorporate natural <b>preservatives</b> to <b>reduce</b> post contamination.

40|$|RATIONALE: Many {{studies have}} {{reported}} the long-term adverse effects of alcohol on executive cognitive function in chronic alcohol abusers, yet little research has investigated the acute effects of alcohol in social drinkers. Studies on acute effects report alcohol-induced deficits on tasks that require executive cognitive processes, with alcohol acting to increase <b>preservative</b> errors and <b>reduce</b> planning. AIM: The present investigation examines the acute effects of a moderate dose of alcohol on a decision-making task that involves participants making a forced choice between two simultaneously presented binary-outcome gambles. METHODS: Alcohol (0. 6 g/kg) or placebo was administered to 32 social drinkers. Participants completed the task, making a total of 80 decisions about gambles that varied in the magnitude of expected gains, losses and the probability with which these outcomes were delivered. Participants also chose between gambles probing identified non-normative biases in human decision making, namely, risk aversion for choosing between gains and risk seeking for choosing between losses. RESULTS: All participants picked the experimental gamble more frequently when the probability of winning was high vs low, when the gains were large vs small and when the losses were small vs large; the alcohol group had an impaired ability to factor in the magnitude of gains {{and the likelihood of}} winning when the losses were large. Deliberation time did not differ between the groups. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that alcohol given acutely impairs risky decision making. In particular, alcohol impairs one's ability to alter responding in light of changing prospective rewards in order to make favourable decisions...|$|R

GettySalt {{is used as}} a <b>preservative</b> in food. <b>Reducing</b> sodium in food, due to its link to hypertension, and {{replacing}} NaCl with other types of salt could have an effect on food safety. The main objective was to determine differences in salts and salt substitutes on growth of Listeria monocytogenes in broth and meat and poultry systems. Salts (NaCl, KCl, CaCl 2, MgCl 2, sea salt, and replacement salt) were added (0. 5, 1, and 2. 5 %) to Listeria monocytogenes (five-strain cocktail) inoculated Listeria enrichment broth at 25 °C and sampled at 0, 24, and 48 h. Results showed that MgCl 2, regardless of concentration, caused Listeria monocytogenes populations to grow approximately 0. 6 log CFU/mL more (P 0. 05) were observed over time in pork or turkey. Salt type did not affect (P > 0. 05) Listeria monocytogenes populations during pre-blend storage. However, salts (MgCl 2 and NaCl) allowed growth (P < 0. 05) of aerobic populations during storage. Emulsified beef and pork products were processed with NaCl, KCl, sea salt and a NaCl/KCl blend (2 %) and post-processed surface inoculated with Listeria monocytogenes (five-strain cocktail) to determine growth/survival at 4 °C for 28 d. Pork products showed greater (P < 0. 05) Listeria monocytogenes population growth at all sampling times (0, 7, 14, 21, and 28 d) than beef products; whereas salt type had no effect on Listeria monocytogenes populations with sampling times pooled for data analysis. Although salt types were not shown {{to have an impact on}} Listeria monocytogenes growth/survival in pre-blend and emulsified post-processed surface inoculated meat products, pork and turkey pre-blends and emulsified pork had greater Listeria monocytogenes populations compared to beef products. These studies demonstrate that sodium reduction or replacement may not affect safety of pre-blends and emulsified meat and poultry products...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2015 Resistance to {{moisture}} uptake is {{an important}} attribute of some wood preservatives and can help reduce moisture cycling {{that leads to the}} development of deep checks. While the potential for preservative treatments to help improve wood/moisture interactions is acknowledged, there are no tests that specifically evaluate this performance parameter. Checking is a particularly important issue for railroad ties and often causes tie failures. A number of new wood preservatives have recently become available on the tie market and {{it would be useful to}} have a standardized test method that compares water repellency and derived physical stability of these preservatives. The objective of this study was to develop one such test method. The role of water repellency on dimensional stability was examined using non-treated and creosote-treated red oak, white oak and black gum samples exposed to 3 - 4 wet/dry cycles. Dimensional stability was assessed by measuring two checking variables - counting the number of checks on the outer most tangential surface and measuring the area of the largest check on the same surface. Check frequency tended to increase with moisture cycling, while largest check area provided a less consistent measure of dimensional change. Creosote treatment did not significantly enhance dimensional stability compared to non-treated samples as measured by check frequency. Water repellency of non-treated, creosote-treated and copper naphthenate-treated samples was assessed by water droplet contact angle. Creosote treatment significantly improved water repellency, but copper naphthenate-treated samples did not differ significantly from non-treated controls. Although creosote treatment did not substantially affect check development, increased water repellency provided by the <b>preservative</b> would likely <b>reduce</b> check development for railroad ties in service by preventing them from reaching the elevated moisture levels necessary for checking to occur...|$|R
40|$|The {{study on}} {{dehydration}} of frozen saskatoon berries {{and the need}} for dried fruits has been strategically identified in the prairies. Our motivation was to find a suitable method for dehydration in order to extend saskatoon berry shelf life for preservation. Microwave, convection and microwave-convection combination drying processes were identified to finish-dry saskatoon berries after osmotic dehydration using sucrose and high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) sugar solutions. Osmotic dehydration removes moisture in small quantities and also introduces solutes into the fruit that acts as a <b>preservative</b> and also <b>reduces</b> the total drying time. Due to the very short harvesting season of saskatoon berries, an accelerated process like microwave combination drying can bring down the moisture to safe storage level, immediately after harvest. Untreated and osmotically dehydrated berries were subjected to convection (control), microwave and microwave-convection combination drying conditions at different product drying temperatures (60, 70 and 80 C) until final moisture content was 25 % dry basis. A laboratory-scale microwave combination dryer was developed, built with temperature and moisture loss data acquisition systems using LabView 6 i software. Thin-layer cross flow dryer was used for convection-only drying and for comparison. Drying kinetics of the drying processes were studied and curve fitting with five empirical equations including Page equation, was carried to determine drying constant, R 2 and standard error values. The microwave-combination drying method proved to be the best for drying saskatoon berries. Dehydrated product quality analysis by means of color changes, rehydration ratio measurements and observed structural changes with scanning electron microscope technique were the factors in drying method selection for saskatoon berries. This research was instrumental in the modification and development of a novel drying system for high-moisture agricultural materials. Microwave-convection combination drying at 70 oC, yields good results with higher drying rates and better end-product quality...|$|R
40|$|The {{degree of}} postharvest losses {{of fruit and}} {{vegetables}} due to attack by microorganisms worldwide is significant. In addition, the use of chemicals increases consumer concerns regarding food safety. Recent studies indicate that exploitation of natural compounds such as essential oils (EOs) may provide an alternative and friendlier way {{for the preservation of}} fresh produce. In this research project the efficacy of Origanum dictamnus L. essential oils (EOs) (a medicinal-aromatic plant of Crete) for the control of B. cinerea, a common postharvest pathogen of three economically important Cretan vegetables, tomato, pepper and eggplant was examined. Pathogen development in culture medium or on fruits was evaluated after treatment with dittany EO (0, 50, 100, 250 ppm) in vitro and in situ when stored at 12 °C and 95 % RH during or following exposure to EO volatiles. The impacts of short term exposure of B. cinerea to volatiles on growth and sporulation were also studied. Fungal development in vitro was completely inhibited by the continued application of 100 or 250 ppm of EO volatiles while inhibitory effects were also marked by lower EO concentration and short time of exposure. In inoculated fruits the 50 ppm of EO application resulted in suppressed disease development by reduced lesion growth and fungal sporulation, where increasing EO concentration led to greater effects. Pre-exposure of fruits to volatiles before fungal inoculation revealed reduced lesion growth, indicating that dittany EO probably caused induced resistance of fruits against the pathogen. Moreover, EO application did not affect quality-related characteristics of fruits while skin lightness and pulp lightness of eggplant fruits was improved under the presence of dittany volatiles. Overall, the results suggest that dittany EO volatiles may be considered as an alternative food <b>preservative</b> treatment, significantly <b>reducing</b> or eliminating B. cinerea infection during fruit storage and perhaps also in transit...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} {{the efficacy of}} freeze-dried amniotic membrane (AM) for reconstruction of the ocular surface in rabbit eyes. METHODS: The sterilized, freeze-dried amniotic membrane (lyophilized or FD-AM) is a preservative method that uses the drying by freezing process to maintain the AM well preserved {{for a long time}} even at room temperature. This paper is an experimental animal interventional study. One eye of each of 15 male New Zealand rabbits (1. 5 - 3. 0 kg) had the central cornea marked with a 6. 0 mm trephine. The marked area was deepithelialized with a No. 15 blade. The denuded corneal surface was covered as follows: Group 1 : cryopreserved AM (n= 6); Group 2 : freeze-dried AM (n= 6); and Group 3 : not covered (control group, n= 3). The AM in group 1 and 2 and the periphery of the denuded area in group 3 were secured with continuous 10 - 0 nylon sutures. The clinical evaluation was made by a blinded observer and graded on a four-point scale (1 = minimal, 4 = marked) for conjunctival and ciliary hyperemia, eyelid edema, corneal neovascularization, corneal opacity and reepithelialization on postoperative (PO) days 1, 7 and 30. After PO day 30, the rabbits were euthanized and their corneas were sent for histopathological and ultrastructural analysis to evaluate tissue inflammation, reepithelialization, and basement membrane integrity. RESULTS: Two eyes in group 2 had a corneal infection and were excluded from the analysis. No statistically significant differences among the three groups were found (p> 0. 05) regarding the clinical evaluation on 1 st, 7 th and 30 th PO days. On transmission electron microscopy, the basement membrane in lyophilized and control groups was more continuous and homogeneous than in the glycerol group. CONCLUSIONS: The freeze-drying method seems to be a good option to preserve human amniotic membrane to be used in ocular surface reconstruction. This <b>preservative</b> method <b>reduces</b> the preservation costs and may enhance the use of AM, facilitating its storage and transport. OBJETIVO: Avaliar a eficácia da liofilização da membrana amniótica (MA) para a reconstrução da superfície ocular em coelhos. MÉTODOS: A liofilização é processo de preservação que mantém a MA estável durante longo tempo mesmo em temperatura ambiente. A córnea de um olho de cada coelho macho da raça Nova Zelândia foi marcada e desepitelizada. Essa área desepitelizada foi coberta com: Grupo 1 : MA criopreservada (n= 6); Grupo 2 : MA liofilizada (n= 6) e Grupo 3 : Não coberta (n= 3). A MA nos grupos 1 e 2 e a periferia da córnea no grupo 3 foram suturadas com nylon 10 - 0. A avaliação clínica foi realizada por um observador cego em relação à hiperemia, neovascularização e edema de córnea e reepitelização nos dia 1, 7 e 30 pós-operatórios. Após o dia 30 os ratos foram eutanizados e suas córneas enviadas para análise histopatológica e ultra-estrutural. RESULTADOS: Dois olhos no grupo 2 foram excluídos da análise devido à infecção. Não foi encontrada diferença estatisticamente significante entre os grupos em relação à avaliação clínica. Na microscopia eletrônica de transmissão, a membrana basal nos grupos de MA liofilizada e controle foi mais contínua e homogênea em relação ao grupo da MA criopreservada. CONCLUSÕES: O processo de liofilização parece ser boa opção para a preservação da membrana amniótica humana para utilização na reconstrução da superfície ocular...|$|R
40|$|As China’s {{economy has}} grown and {{personal}} income has risen {{over the past}} decade, spending on landscaping and public works projects has increased dramatically, and with it China’s demand for treated softwood lumber. New luxury residential developments commonly include traditional Chinese landscape design, which includes man-made lakes and waterways traversed by footbridges and flanked by wooden fences, gazebos, and pavilions with decks. Government projects to revitalize shopping areas and tourist destinations has boosted demand for high-quality US treated southern yellow pine (SYP) lumber used to build walkways, bridges, stages, and landscaping elements. Treated softwood lumber {{is a relatively new}} product in China, yet imports have increased steadily over the past several years. However, as demand for treated softwood lumber has increased, the number of domestic wood treaters has also increased. These new Chinese lumber treaters pose a competitive threat because many produce poor quality treated lumber which threatens to undermine the good reputation that US treated SYP has established. This research is intended to provide US suppliers with a description of the Chinese treated softwood lumber market and strategic marketing recommendations. This report is based on information collected through interviews with treating plant managers, softwood lumber distributors, and other industry experts. Additional information was collected from surveys completed by Chinese architects, distributors, and other construction professionals. The report consists of four parts: 1) an overview of the China’s wood preserving industry, 2) a description of the Chinese treated softwood lumber market, 3) results of surveys about user perceptions and attitudes about various treated softwood lumber species used in China, and 4) strategic implications for US manufacturers, exporters and industry associations. Key findings include the following: 1) China’s treated softwood lumber market is extremely competitive and price dependent. The majority of the treated lumber used in China is supplied by local treaters offering low prices. Russian pine treated with Chromated Copper Arsenate (CCA) {{is by far the most}} widely used treated softwood lumber species in China, due to its low price. However, imported and Chinese treated US SYP is quickly establishing a niche in high-quality market segments and many Chinese treaters report that they would buy as much untreated US SYP as they have access to. The majority of treated SYP from the US is used in government-funded projects where interest in quality and durability is more important than low price. 2) Chromated Copper Arsenate (CCA) is the most widely used treating chemical used by Chinese treaters. A growing number of Chinese treaters have started to use Alkaline Copper Quatenary (ACQ) and several are developing their own environmentally responsible treating chemicals. Since China has no regulations governing the preservative treated lumber industry, most Chinese treaters develop their own chemicals or dilute purchased <b>preservatives</b> to <b>reduce</b> costs, and the quality and durability of lumber treated with these chemicals is reportedly poor. As China’s government enacts more environmental standards and as more Chinese manufacturers follow international environmental standards as a means of accessing international markets, interest in environmentally-friendly treating chemicals should increase. Survey responses indicate that Chinese construction professionals rate the importance of environmentally-friendly treating chemicals fourth highest in a list of ten quality and service attributes associated with preservative treated softwood lumber. With no regulatory body however, the majority of Chinese treaters will likely use substandard preservative treating chemicals and treating procedures to keep product costs low. 3) According to survey results, US treated SYP has established a reputation as a high-quality, durable and environmentally-friendly building material. As stated above, since China has no standards governing proper treating methods and chemicals, and no testing body to ensure the quality and durability of domestic treated lumber, US industry representatives are concerned that domestically treated softwood lumber may erode the reputation of US treated SYP. 4) While survey respondents rated softwood species from the western US highly, Chinese treaters have negative perceptions about the species. Primary concerns were that Douglas-fir lumber does not absorb preservative treating chemicals completely and the ends require re-treating if the lumber is sawn after initial treating. Conversely, treaters were resistant to using Hem-fir because it absorbs preservative treating chemicals too readily, which increases the price of treating. 5) According to interviews with Chinese lumber treaters and softwood lumber distributors, US exporters face several barriers to expanding their market share in China. The most significant of these obstacles is that most consumers do not understand the differences in performance and durability between imported US treated softwood lumber and less expensive domestically treated lumber. Second, US suppliers continue to face obstacles associated with not providing lumber in metric sizes. Finally, Chinese distributors report that not having ready access to US lumber prices hampers their ability to quote prices as readily as suppliers of domestic treated lumber. 6) Environmental regulations in China are few and enforcement is inconsistent. However, the Chinese government is reportedly investigating the feasibility of reducing environmental pollution by imposing legislative and economic measures on “dirty” industries. Industry experts anticipate that new environmental regulations applied to the Chinese wood treating industry may improve the competitiveness of US preservative treated lumber compared to locally treated lumber. 7) China’s distribution system for softwood lumber is regionally fragmented with hundreds of thousands of distributors, trading markets, and sales outlets across the country. This regional fragmentation makes it important for US suppliers to work with distributors in several regions of China or with a distributor who has a network of regional representatives. Chinese distributors who have become recognized as experts with a basic understanding of wood frame design and softwood lumber performance characteristics have gained a competitive edge over their less knowledgeable competitors. 8) As manufacturers and distributors work to differentiate themselves from their competition, survey respondents report an interest in naturally decay resistant and lesser used species such as Alaska yellow cedar, Sitka spruce and western red cedar from the western US and Canada. The US softwood lumber industry has been successful in developing the Chinese market for preservative treated softwood lumber. To a large degree, this success has been based on educational programs that have raised construction professional’s awareness of the superior performance and durability of softwood lumber that has been properly treated to international wood treating standards. The results of this research clearly demonstrate that there is a brand awareness of US preservative treated southern yellow pine as the “gold standard” of treated softwood lumber products in the Chinese market. Like any successful branding effort, the rapid development of the preservative treated softwood lumber market has spawned low-cost domestically treated products with inferior performance and poor durability. Often, domestically treated SYP is marketed as US-treated SYP. In other cases, pine from South America is marketed as US SYP. In a price sensitive market like China, where markets tend to move towards a commodity focus, it is hardly surprising that these domestically treated, low-priced products have gained a surprising degree of market success. The success of these inferior treated lumber products threatens to undermine the entire market for treated softwood lumber if consumers associate the poor performance and low durability of this domestically produced inferior treated lumber with all treated softwood lumber. To the extent that US preservative lumber manufacturers and exporters allow the commoditization of treated softwood lumber, they stand the risk of having US treated lumber be subject to consumer perceptions based on the poor quality of domestic Chinese treated lumber. From a marketing perspective, it becomes important that the US industry adopt a branding strategy that allows consumers and end-users to differentiate high quality US treated lumber from low quality domestically treated lumber. Thus, it is imperative that the US treated lumber industry work with industry associations and their Chinese distributors to implement a promotion and education strategy to differentiate US preservative treated lumber from competing products. Fundamentally, this marketing strategy would help prevent the commoditization of US treated lumber in the Chinese market and ensure that the poor performance of domestically treated lumber in China does not adversely affect the reputation or demand for US treated lumber. Failure to do this would seriously jeopardize the market for US treated lumber in China...|$|R
