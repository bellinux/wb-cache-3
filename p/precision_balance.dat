50|$|Passage {{friction}} and flow separation cause impeller losses {{that depend on}} relative velocity, rate of diffusion, and blade geometry. Impeller dynamic balancing usually is done on a <b>precision</b> <b>balancing</b> machine, because all energy of vibrational imbalance is lost (for example, this can easily amount to 50% of air-flow loss in poorly-maintained home AC units).|$|R

50|$|The RIC setup {{includes}} a beaker {{to host the}} imbibing fluid. A thin rope connects the core sample to a high <b>precision</b> <b>balance</b> (0.001 gm accurate). A hanging core sample is positioned with the bottom part of the sample barely touching the imbibing fluid in the beaker. Relative saturation as well as mass of core samples starts to change during imbibition. A computer connected to a balance continuously monitors the core sample mass change over time. Plots of squared mass change versus time are generated.|$|E
5000|$|There are no voting {{machines}} in Switzerland; all votes are counted by hand. Every municipality randomly recruits {{a number of}} citizens who have the duty of counting the ballots, but penalties for disobeying this duty have become rare. However, after people sort the ballots (e.g. [...] "yes" [...] and [...] "no"), then {{the total number of}} [...] "yes" [...] and [...] "no" [...] votes are counted either manually or, in bigger cities, by an automatic counter (like the ones used in banks to count banknotes); or the ballots are weighed by a <b>precision</b> <b>balance.</b> Vote counting is usually accomplished within five or six hours, but in large cities, such as Zurich or Geneva, counting the votes in parliamentary elections may take much longer.|$|E

5000|$|The Allmusic review {{awarded by}} Michael G. Nastos the album 3½ stars stating [...] "Dino Saluzzi {{as a solo}} {{performer}} {{is one of the}} more remarkable musicians in contemporary music, in that he plays several instruments, including his beloved bandoneon with such <b>precision,</b> <b>balance</b> and subtle power. Kultrum is indeed a multi-cultural project that taps into the folkloric, ancestral, and traditional sounds of Native American Indians and his South American roots, enhanced by producer Manfred Eicher's Eurocentric notions. The blending of deep drums, rattling percussion, and chanted vocals with the bandoneon or wood flutes creates a vista of deeply spiritual and ancient ritualistic music. Somehow these sounds are magically transmuted and modernized by the pristine sonic tones the ECM production team always lends to their albums, making this a true contemporary world music tour de force.|$|E
5000|$|Thermogravimetric {{analysis}} (TGA) {{relies on}} {{a high degree of}} precision in three measurements: mass change, temperature, and temperature change. Therefore, the basic instrumental requirements for TGA are a <b>precision</b> <b>balance</b> with a pan loaded with the sample, and a programmable furnace. The furnace can be programmed either for a constant heating rate, or for heating to acquire a constant mass loss with time. Though a constant heating rate is more common, a constant mass loss rate can illuminate specific reaction kinetics. For example, the kinetic parameters of the carbonization of polyvinyl butyral were found using a constant mass loss rate of 0.2 wt %/min. [...] Regardless of the furnace programming, the sample is placed in a small, electrically heated furnace equipped with a thermocouple to monitor accurate measurements of the temperature by comparing its voltage output with that of the voltage-versus-temperature table stored in the computer’s memory. A reference sample may be placed on another balance in a separate chamber. The atmosphere in the sample chamber may be purged with an inert gas to prevent oxidation or other undesired reactions. A different process using a quartz crystal microbalance has been devised for measuring smaller samples on the order of a microgram (versus milligram with conventional TGA).|$|E
40|$|A new {{technique}} for {{the characterization of}} shrinkage during drying of granular products {{over a wide range}} of operating conditions, and its application to Baker’s yeast fibers is presented. External dimensions and mass of samples are simultaneously and continuously recorded using a stereomicroscope and a <b>precision</b> <b>balance.</b> Sample dimensions are deduced from image treatments that include threshold level application, binary imaging, noise removal and sample edge detection. This technique is not intrusive and not threshold level sensitive. It enables calculation of key drying parameters such as particle dimensions, mean particle porosity, porosity of the dry region and specific surface area. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

30|$|This paper {{compared}} the efficiency gains which are achievable using LiDAR data as a priori auxiliary information in P. radiata inventory samples. The efficiency gains {{observed in the}} model-based strategy, compared to simple random sampling, were equivalent to reducing the sample size from 46 to 10 plots in the Green Hills study site and from 79 to 38 plots in the Nundle 2002 AC site. Although the simulations favoured the model-based approach, the model-assisted design-based estimators also achieved good levels of <b>precision.</b> <b>Balanced</b> sampling {{was used in the}} model-based strategies as an alternative to stratification and proved to be an effective option.|$|R
30|$|OQ should consider: i) a {{verification}} {{of the software}} user access policy, {{with reference to the}} different possible level of privileges (e.g. administrators usually have the right to modify any parameters, sequences, methods, etc., while operators should have the possibility to run dispensing programs only); ii) a {{verification of}} the software sequences, if applicable; iii) a verification of the possible effects of a general power failure (e.g. to check for the presence and / or the need for an UPS; iv) a verification of the calibration status of the major components; for instance, in several dispensing systems, vial filling accuracy is based on balances that weigh the solution during filling operations; balance is in this case a critical component and its performance could be evaluated during OQ by comparison with a calibrated <b>precision</b> <b>balance,</b> using certified weights. Certificate of calibration of the reference balance and weights should not be expired and {{should be included in the}} validation documentation. Dispensing systems for individual syringes preparation are preferably based on direct radioactivity determination using dose calibrators: in this case the dose calibrator is the critical component, whose calibration status need to be verified during OQ (see below). One more example of critical components in dispensing systems are the pumps often used to draw / push fluids through tubing assemblies; again, a verification of their calibration (e.g. by measuring dispensed volumes with a reference <b>precision</b> <b>balance)</b> should be performed during OQ; v) a verification of data backup and restore.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{discharge}} flow in a cylindrical and a rectangular silo using both monodisperse and bidisperse mixtures of spherical glass beads is studied experimentally. The flow rate is measured using a <b>precision</b> <b>balance</b> {{for a large}} range of particle diameters, size ratios, and outlet diameters. A simple physical model is proposed to describe the flow of bidisperse mixtures. It gives an expression for the flow rate and predicts that the bulk velocity follows a simple mixture law. This model implies that a mixture diameter cannot be simply defined. Moreover it is shown that bidisperse granular media allow for the transport of coarse particles below their jamming conditions...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{dispensing}} {{system is}} used in a materials-mixing plant to provide accurate blend ratios in producing the desired end-use product. The AIS-based (Artificial Immune Systems) fine tuning of dispensing parameters is proposed by optimizing the components of dispensing time and stopping time delay to obtain constant and accurate reading from the <b>precision</b> <b>balance</b> scale. Based on the new dispensing sequence, experimental tests had been carried out using different materials with varying viscosities.

40|$|Friction {{and wear}} {{behavior}} of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) sliding against AISI 420 C {{austenitic stainless steel}} and against TiAl 6 V 4 alloy under dry and lubricated conditions were investigated with a reciprocating pin-on-flat tribometer for comparative purposes. The tests were conducted by varying frequency of the pin alternative motion and the applied normal load. For the tests in lubricated conditions a fluid containing {{a large amount of}} sodium hyaluronate has been chosen. By using an electronic <b>precision</b> <b>balance</b> the wear mass loss of the UHMWPE samples was evaluated accordingly. Friction is greatly reduced by the presence of UHMWPE and this is believed to be due to the formation of a lubricating film of UHMWPE in the contact zone.

5000|$|The balance (also balance scale, {{beam balance}} and {{laboratory}} balance) {{was the first}} mass measuring instrument invented.
