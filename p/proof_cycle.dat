40|$|Abstract. There is {{a common}} {{perception}} by which small numbers are considered more concrete and large numbers more abstract. A mathematical formalization of this idea was introduced by Parikh (1971) through an inconsistent theory of feasible numbers in which addition and multiplication are as usual but for which some very large number is defined to be not feasible. Parikh shows that sufficiently short proofs in this theory can only prove true statements of arithmetic. We pursue these topics in light of logical flow graphs of proofs (Buss, 1991) and show that Parikh’s lower bound for concrete consistency reflects the presence of cycles in the logical graphs of short proofs of feasibility of large numbers. We discuss two concrete constructions which show the bound to be optimal and bring out the dynamical aspect of formal proofs. For this paper the concept of feasible numbers has two roles, as an idea with its own life and {{as a vehicle for}} exploring general principles on the dynamics and geometry of <b>proofs.</b> <b>Cycles</b> {{can be seen as a}} measure of how complicated a proof can be.

40|$|The fiber {{manufacturing}} {{has traditionally}} had three different process phases: Preform Manufacturing, Fiber Draw and Proof Testing. This thesis focuses on combining draw process and proof testing, which requires catching the fiber end after break at full production speed without disturbing the draw process. Proof testing means applying a specified tensile load to continuous lengths of optical fiber. The tensile load is applied for as short time as possible, yet sufficiently long {{to ensure the}} glass experiences the proof stress. The <b>proof</b> test <b>cycle</b> {{is divided into three}} steps: load, dwell and unload. Nowadays the industry commonly accepts that the dwell time has minor effect on the final minimum strength of fiber, but the strength decreases during the <b>proof</b> testing <b>cycle.</b> The unload time {{is considered to be a}} machine property by capstan design, but new approach is suggested in this thesis, where the unload time is a material property. The two-region crack growth theory states that depending on the unload rate the crack growth may happen in two region. The effect of the coating was also studied. It was found that at high load rates the coating carries a substantially higher part of the load. Additionally theories suggest that the strength of the fiber is significantly higher just after draw than approx. 1 hour later, because of water penetration. An approach for modeling tension behavior in combined draw and proof testing process mathematically was introduced and a universal simulating tool was generated. Experiments were carried out to verify the theory. The first was the draw tension experiment. The second part was the comparison of the conventional proof tension measurement and the new method needed for the combined processes. After this the effect of the different process elements were evaluated. Two different methods to survive proof testing break were introduced and tested. A combination of tubes and belts turned to be the most reliable. Since the winding quality is important, a new winding algorithm was developed. Several trials focused on preventing whipping phenomenon. An optimal whipping guard and auxiliary blade minimized the whipping. The transfer reliability was tested with a separate take-up module. The result was that the transfer reliability is at satisfactory level at the existing production speeds. The future work will include more experimental testing, which will combine the critical components into one machine. The overall reliability depends on how well these critical components are integrated to each other. reviewe...|$|R

In a full integrity assessment, the presence of initial residual stresses (RS) {{needs to be taken}} into account.

Relaxation of RS following several <b>proof</b> load <b>cycles,</b> in form of internal pressure, applied to the vessel is explored using finite element simulations. It is found that the proof loading process generally relaxes the RS and is proved to be beneficial to both cracked and un-cracked vessels with or without the presence of initial RS.

40|$|Biomass {{formation}} {{represents one}} of the most basic aspects of bacterial metabolism. While there is an abundance of information concerning individual reactions that result in cell duplication, there has been surprisingly little information on the bioenergetics of growth. For many years, it was assumed that biomass production (anabolism) was proportional to the amount of ATP which could be derived from energy-yielding pathways (catabolism), but later work showed that the ATP yield (YATP) was not necessarily a constant. Continuous-culture experiments indicated that bacteria utilized ATP for metabolic reactions that were not directly related to growth (maintenance functions). Mathematical derivations showed that maintenance energy appeared to be a growth rate-independent function of the cell mass and time. Later work, however, showed that maintenance energy alone could not account for all the variations in yield. Because only some of the discrepancy could be explained by the secretion of metabolites (overflow metabolism) or the diversion of catabolism to metabolic pathways which produced less ATP, it appeared that energy-excess cultures had mechanisms of spilling energy. Bacteria have the potential to spill excess ATP in futile enzyme cycles, but there has been little <b>proof</b> that such <b>cycles</b> are significant. Recent work indicated that bacteria can also use futile cycles of potassium, ammonia, and protons through the cell membrane to dissipate ATP either directly or indirectly. The utility of energy spilling in bacteria has been a curiosity.

The exceptions are in some regions of the high Asia. 10 – 4 ka BP and during the 1 th Century CE to the early 13 th century CE the glaciers were close by sizes to the modern ones or even smaller. The pattern is confirmed by the upper and Northern tree line advances in the Northern Hemisphere.

Due to the coincidence of several eruptions with the Bond cycles (solar minima) it is difficult to distinguish between the solar and volcanic signals in the Early Holocene records. The coupling between the glacial and solar/volcanic forcings in the mid Holocene is less evident, but it become strong again in the last 2 ka (1. 4 ka and LIA events).   The modern glacier retreat disagrees with the actual orbital forcings and is due to both solar and anthropogenic influence.

Thus it follows easily that |[S: ¯ S] | is even. ‘If’: If G has an vertex, say v, of odd degree, then the cut [v : V (G) v] is odd. (ii) ‘Only If’: Any cycle alternates between the two vertex classes, so it has even length. ‘If’: We may assume that the graph G is connected, since a graph is bipartite if its components are bipartite. Let the distance d(u, v) be the length of shortest path between u and v. Fix u. Define Ui = v: d(u, v) = i. Note that an edge of G can join vertices in Ui and Uj only if j = i or j = i + 1 or j = i − 1. We claim that there is no edge between vertices in Ui. If xy ∈ Ui then the path x-u and y-u have the same length of i. Let z be the last common vertex. Then z-x, z-y and xy form a cycle of length 2 (i − d(u, v)) + 1, which contradicts the absence of odd cycles. Thus V (G) can be divided into two parts, U 0 ∪ U 2 ∪ U 4 ∪ · · · and U 1 ∪ U 3 ∪ U 5 ∪ · · ·. And it is a bipartition of G. Exercise 4 Prove Turán’s Theorem: Let n ≥ p ≥ 3. The unique simple graph G on n vertices without p-cliques and the maximum number of edges is the complete multipartite graph Kn 1, · · ·, Knp− 1, where � ni = n and |ni − nj | ≤ 1. Proof. The proof here is from Exercise 5. 2. 23 of [1]. Firstly, we claim that a maximal simple graph having no r + 1 -clique has an r-clique. Since adding an edge to the graph may form an r + 1 -clique, hence the graph contains Kr+ 1 e, thus it has an r-clique. Now we establish an indentity about number of edges of Tn,r. Let a = [n/r], then Tn,r has n − ar partite sets of size a + 1 and (a + 1) r − n partite sets of size a. Then Tn−r,r has n − ar partite sets of size a and (a + 1) r − n partite sets of a − 1. Hence n − ar (a + 1) r − n e(Tn,r) − e(Tn−r,r) = (2 a + 1) + (2 a − 1) + (n − ar) ((a + 1) r − n) 2...|$|R
