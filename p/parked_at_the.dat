5|$|Worle {{has had a}} {{large number}} of {{incidents}} of railway vandalism and antisocial behaviour, and the stretch of line through Worle {{is considered one of the}} most vandalised in the United Kingdom– obstructions have been left on the line and stones have being thrown at railway staff. There have been several incidents of train guards being attacked by passengers who refused to pay their fares, including one incident where the guard was dragged from the train and knocked to the ground. Vandals have also damaged the station's ticket machines, attacked passengers and slashed the tyres of cars <b>parked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> station.|$|E
5|$|No.86 Wing was {{originally}} {{to have been}} augmented by a third combat unit, No.94 Squadron, flying Mosquitos. Formed in May 1945, the squadron was still undergoing training when the war ended, and it was disbanded at RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales, in January 1946. In December 1945, shortly {{after the end of}} the Pacific War, the commanding officer of No.93 Squadron, Squadron Leader D.K.M. Gulliver, crashed his Beaufighter on takeoff at Labuan, colliding with two P-51 Mustangs of No.77 Squadron <b>parked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> airfield; Gulliver and five people on the ground died in the accident, including the then-Officer Commanding No.86 Wing, Group Captain L.C.M. Holswich. Between January and March 1946, the Beaufighters escorted Mustangs of No.81 Wing to Japan for service as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. In August that year, Nos.1 and 93 Squadrons disbanded at Narromine, New South Wales.|$|E

5|$|One 45-minute {{practice}} session on Friday was held {{before the two}} races. The session was held on a dirty track with lap times gradually improving over the 45-minute period when the cars cleaned the circuit. Nato set the fastest lap {{with a time of}} 1:55.392, ahead of Giovinazzi in second and Sirotkin third. Gasly was fourth-fastest; Rowland was fifth and Luca Ghiotto sixth. King, Arthur Pic, Marciello, and Sergio Canamasas rounded out the session's top-ten drivers. The session was disrupted when King went onto the turn 15 run-off area and was required to swerve to avoid hitting a van <b>parked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> corner. It prompted the activation of the virtual safety car (VSC) to allow the vehicle to be moved. Two further VSC periods were necessitated late in the session when Marciello and Gustav Malja slid off the track at the same corner, ending their sessions prematurely.|$|E
5|$|During {{the day on}} June 29, the KPAF {{returned}} to attack Suwon, and six sorties of North Korean aircraft strafed the airfield during the morning, but each time were driven off by American F-80s, {{and in the course}} of these attacks Lieutenant William T. Norris and Lieutenant Roy W. Marsh each shot down a North Korean aircraft. The North Koreans were able to destroy a single C-54 Skymaster <b>parked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> airfield. The sorties culminated in a battle above Suwon in the midst of a conference of US military leaders in the town. Leaders including US Lieutenant General George E. Stratemeyer and General of the Army Douglas MacArthur personally witnessed the final sortie of the day, in which four North Korean aircraft attacked four F-51 Mustang aircraft over the town. The four F-51s succeeded in shooting down all four of the North Korean aircraft, with Lieutenant Orrin R. Fox scoring two kills and Lieutenants Richard J. Burns, and Harry T. Sandlin scoring one each. Ground forces also downed a North Korean aircraft during a subsequent attack. MacArthur subsequently authorized Stratemeyer to launch strikes into North Korea to destroy North Korean airfields and establish air superiority for the US forces.|$|E

The first official report of fatalities among the hostages came at about 9:00a.m. (despite the death of five children which had been already reported by medical personnel, the official statement claimed there were no children among the dead).|$|E
25|$|As {{operations}} had {{run with}} a loss for many years, the power station owners decided to terminate operations from 4 January 1965. Initially operations were merely temporarily placed on hood. The tracks were kept and the railcars <b>parked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> depot at Solbergfoss. A few freight trains were run, but this stopped after one derailed. The newly formed Norwegian Railway Club was given the two railcars in 1969. These were driven to Askim and then transported onward to the Krøderen Line. They were renovate and have since {{become part of the}} heritage railway operations there. The tracks were demolished in 1970.|$|E
