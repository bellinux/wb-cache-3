The {{experimental}} {{results of the}} <b>photomagnetoelectric</b> <b>effect</b> (PMEE) dependencies on the magnetic field H for film samples (d- 10 - 5 sm) of chalcogenide spinel CdCrzSa (Curie point Tc- 129 K) are presented in this work. The measurements of the PMEE have been conducted at different H (to 14 kOe) and temperature T (83 - 293 K). An analysis of the PMEE short-circuit current dependencies on H at different T and comparison with magnetic properties of the compound CdCrzSe 4 show that in the ferromagnetic region the PMEE consists of the PMEE, which takes place at small H, and the PMEE, which {{is proportional to the}} external H. At Curie temperature the spontaneous effect disappears. In the far paramagnetic region exists only the ordinary PMEE. In the general case, the PMEE may be presented as sum of the ordinary PMEE, which is proportional to the magnetic induction B, and the anomalous PMEE, which is proportional to the magnetisation M, as in case of Hall-effect in ferromagnetics. The <b>photomagnetoelectric</b> <b>effect</b> (PMEE) of Kikoin-Noskov is widely used for studying semiconductor materials and determining characteristics of the charge camers. The receivers of radiation were constructed on its basis. However, the PMEE wasn't applied for investigation of magnetic semiconductors. Up to now the PMEE is observed only in [I]. In substances with magnetic ordering the PMEE can be different from one in ordinary semiconductors. In ferromagnetic the PMEE must be proportional to magnetic induction B, determining Lorenz force, but not th...|$|E

40|$|The {{electrical}} properties of semi-insulating Cr-doped GaAs are quite sensitive to monochromatic light irradiation, and thus photoelectronic data are {{of great value}} in elucidating {{the nature of this}} material. In this paper we present a theoretical basis for the determination of the photoconductivity, photo-Hall, and <b>photomagnetoelectric</b> <b>effects,</b> measure these effects in typical GaAs:Cr crystals, and show how the results lead to useful information about substrate quality...|$|R
40|$|Metal-Insulator-InSb structures, for {{infrared}} imaging devices {{operating in the}} charge injection mode, have been developed. The sensitivity of devices is conditioned by the generation-recombination processes occurring in the semiconductor. Several methods {{have been used to}} study these generation-recombination processes. C(t) experiments in depletion and inversion regime, conductance measurements and <b>photomagnetoelectric</b> <b>effects</b> were performed on Al-Al 2 O 3 -n InSb MIS structures, in order to obtain data about recombination processes. These experimental results show a gradient in carriers lifetime which varies from 1 ns at the insulator-InSb interface to 100 ns inside the bulk of InSb...|$|R
