500|$|Through a metafictional and [...] voice, the contemporary, postmodern narrator {{questions}} {{the role of}} the author and the historian in thinking about the past. In her article discussing the use of <b>paratext,</b> or the contextualizing text printed in the book such as the footnotes and epigraphs, Deborah Bowen argues that the novel's <b>paratext</b> forces the reader, like in other postmodern works, to rethink the importance of such peripheral material that in other contexts will get overlooked in light of preference for the main text. Instead of nicely complementing the main plot and adding meaning, these paratextual elements can distract from the effectiveness of the novel and challenging the authority of the narrative voice.|$|E
50|$|<b>Paratext</b> is {{a concept}} in {{literary}} interpretation. The main text of published authors (e.g. the story, non-fiction description, poems, etc.) is often surrounded by other material supplied by the authors, editors, printers, and publishers, which {{is known as the}} <b>paratext.</b> These added elements form a frame for the main text, and can change the reception of a text or its interpretation by the public. <b>Paratext</b> is most often associated with books, as they typically include a cover (with associated cover art), title, front matter (dedication, opening information, foreword), back matter (endpapers, colophon) footnotes, and many other materials not crafted by the author. Other editorial decisions can also fall into the category of <b>paratext,</b> such as the formatting or typography. Because of their close association with the text, it may seem that authors should be given the final say about paratextual materials, but often that is not the case. One example of controversy surrounding <b>paratext</b> is the case of the 2009 young adult novel Liar, which was initially published with an image of a white girl on the cover, although the narrator of the story was identified in the text as black.|$|E
5000|$|Literary theorist Gérard Genette defines <b>paratext</b> {{as those}} things in a {{published}} work that accompany the text, things such as the author's name, the title, preface or introduction, or illustrations.Genette states [...] "More than a boundary or a sealed border, the <b>paratext</b> is, rather, a threshold." [...] It is [...] "a zone between text and off-text, a zone not only of transition but also of transaction: a privileged place of pragmatics and a strategy, of an influence on the public, an influence that ... is {{at the service of}} a better reception for the text and a more pertinent reading of it". Then quoting Philippe Lejeune, Genette further describes <b>paratext</b> as [...] "a fringe of the printed text which in reality controls one's whole reading of the text".|$|E

40|$|During {{the sixteenth}} century, the {{traditional}} act of dedicating a text {{took on a}} new meaning due to the wider dissemination of the printed book. As the dedication and other <b>paratexts</b> thus became an almost indispensable part of the publication, they merit careful examination by those who study the presentation and impact of any printed work in its context. <b>Paratexts</b> {{bridge the gap between}} the outside World of the reading public and the enclosed world of the book, and often present biographical information concerning the persons involved in the making of the book. In the present volume, general reflections as well as case studies in the field of <b>paratexts</b> to Latin works and to musical compositions on Latin texts consider and exemplify these as well as other aspects of <b>paratexts.</b> The multidisciplinary perspective further enriches the insight in form, function and nature of the dedicatory act in the sixteenth century.

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} the <b>paratexts</b> of Dorothy Richardson’s long modernist novel sequence, Pilgrimage. Peritexts, {{such as the}} prefaces to Pilgrimage, and epitexts, such as letters {{written by}} Richardson and others about Pilgrimage, are explored alongside other paratextual material such as the front covers of different editions, peritextual blurbs and epitextual reviews. I consider the <b>paratexts</b> of Pilgrimage to be as worthy of study as the anchoring text itself and seek to explain the recurrence of particular paratextual themes which have served to cast doubt on Pilgrimage’s status and Richardson’s qualities as a writer. Linguistic markers of tentativeness and reservation circulate in Pilgrimage’s paratextual space, inscribing a dominant tone that has served, at times, to undermine Pilgrimage and its author. This thesis, by using a range of interdisciplinary, contextualist approaches from narratology, stylistics and modernist studies, traces the links between Pilgrimage’s <b>paratexts.</b> In so doing it seeks to explain the prominence and liminality of certain <b>paratexts</b> and analyses the collisions and collusions that have characterised Pilgrimage’s paratextual space...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{looks at}} 1920 s ballyhoo stunts {{routinely}} {{deployed in the}} exploitation of cinema in the US, a set of uniquely ephemeral <b>paratexts</b> that exist only during performance. Yet despite this inherent ephemerality, these media <b>paratexts</b> matter for the historically resilient mode of media presence that they propose. By analyzing these stunts and their modern variants, I show that media <b>paratexts</b> have a a meta-ability to frame not merely the narrative or the text, but the text-reading activity itself. The transactional nature of such <b>paratexts</b> is essentially playful, self-reflexive, and participatory—a mode of media reception that has opened up, and continues {{to open up the}} spaces of everyday life to the presence of media fictions. Clearly, such meta-ability to receive media as an engaging game must form a key aspect to a project of understanding how audiences inhabit and enjoy the spaces of “cinematic heterotopia,” and imposes to reconsider the experience of presence not as illusion, but as game...|$|R

40|$|Ebooks {{have caused}} a {{revolution}} in how people read fiction. Ereading devices and apps now integrate interactive features which {{have led to the}} development of digital reading communities populated by millions of readers from around the world, with a resurgence of social reading practices in new forms. Two of the biggest social reading communities in existence today are hosted by Amazon’s Kindle and Wattpad. This thesis offers an analysis of how these platforms’ readers are using the interactive technology within the pages of their ebooks to participate in these online reading communities. Original research into popular texts on Wattpad reveals that while only a small percentage of users are actively engaging with the ebooks and other readers during the process of reading, all active and passive interactions have a significant influence on the reading experience. Thus, the infrastructure of such communities ‘rewards’ serialised books which encourage higher levels of reader interactivity with greater recognition within the community, but this reward is short-lived. The application of Genette’s paratextual theory to the interactive features of these ereading platforms reveals new processes of authorisation and readers-as-writers. New paths for the evolution of digital paratextual theory see <b>paratexts</b> developing from ‘thresholds’ into ‘vectors’. The statistical notations of reader interactions are now informational <b>paratexts</b> attached to each ebook, and these online reading communities may be considered <b>paratexts</b> themselves, operating through the new paratextual phenomenon of digital marginalia. Furthermore, the existence of these reading communities on free platforms such as Wattpad is supported by commercial <b>paratexts</b> found within the ebook pages. These new <b>paratexts</b> are iii having a significant impact on social ereading and reading communities - such as how they operate and judge the ‘value’ of ebooks - but historical precedents suggest these <b>paratexts</b> will be readily accepted by most readers, leading to an increase in the incidence and influence of such digital <b>paratexts.</b> These new interactive technologies and <b>paratexts</b> will potentially lead to significant changes in how fiction is read. Exactly how these technologies may develop, and how public, industrial, and academic stakeholders might take advantage of these opportunities, requires further research...|$|R
40|$|In {{the textual}} {{tradition}} {{of a literary}} work, our sources (manuscripts, printed books etc.) commonly bear, together with the "main text", different kinds of "paratexts" commenting on it (including interlinear annotations, glosses, scholia, footnotes, modern scholarly introductions and commentaries, and many others). This article proposes a unified model for a document-based digital critical edition including both the main texts and the <b>paratexts</b> as they appear in different single sources.

Studying the <b>paratexts,</b> in relation to the texts, allows for the detection of ways in which fictional prose was legitimised, many times in an adverse context, with regard to censorial mechanisms, also contributing {{to the study of the}} censorial institution in the 17 th century in Portugal...|$|R

40|$|Today, most media authors {{acknowledge}} {{and to some}} degree integrate the user-generated content of their fandom. Some, however, still perform authoritarian positions of prohibition. George R. R. Martin, the creator of A Song of Ice and Fire, attempts to ban fanfiction, whilst acknowledging he cannot control use of the characters licensed to the TV adaptation (Game of Thrones). Building on the work of Jonathan Gray and Alexandra Herzog on <b>paratexts</b> in fandom studies, this article performs a critical discourse analysis on a systematic sample of the <b>paratexts</b> fanfic authors attach to fanfic from a cross section of online forums. These statements discursively reconfigure constructions of authorship and ownership, strongly inflected by the factors of site, audience and category. However, these <b>paratexts</b> evidence a paradox, legitimating their work by reference to the authority of what is already legitimate. The more radical gesture may be the absence of paratextual justification, and refusal of the incitement to discourse' which Foucault recognised as a technique of modern power...|$|R

40|$|Monster Business is {{a feature}} film project {{comprising}} a horror-thriller feature screenplay and an accompanying exegesis. The screenplay is about a best-selling author who is behind on the delivery of the sequel to his money-spinning first novel and is made an offer by an enigmatic stranger to help rearrange his working environment to facilitate the rapid completion of the manuscript. Over the coming hours, then months, the author discovers just how far the stranger will go to complete the terms of this bizarre and brutal new contract. This accompanying exegesis examines a series of 'paratexts' (a logline, a one-pager and a treatment) that the screenplay has given rise to. The thesis argues {{that the role of}} the screenwriter does not end with the production of the core text [...] the screenplay. Instead, in order to support the development and/or the marketing of the script into {{a feature film}}, the screenwriter is an ongoing generator of supplemental documents or <b>paratexts.</b> The paper explores the status and function of <b>paratexts</b> (loglines, onepagers, treatments and explanatory development notes). It further argues that developmental <b>paratexts</b> are a necessary evil, providing a sifting or culling mechanism for producers and production executives, and that they are intended to guide a project toward being 'greenlit' but will more often have, at best, benign or, at worst, negative or destructive effects on its development.
