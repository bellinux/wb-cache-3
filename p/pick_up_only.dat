500|$|Michael {{compared}} {{his relationship}} to Holly {{to that of the}} protagonists in the 1989 romantic comedy, When Harry Met Sally.... "Company Picnic" [...] writer Jennifer Celotta said the final scene with Jim and Pam reacting to her pregnancy while the cameras film from outside the hospital room was an homage to a scene in the British version of The Office. In that scene, Tim Canterbury proclaims his love for Dawn Tinsley in a meeting room, but Tim turns off his microphone first so the cameras <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>only</b> their reactions and no sound. Celotta said of the scene, [...] "We are all big fans of the moment that Tim takes off his mic and tells Dawn how he feels.

[...] Luis Suarez scored {{four of the}} goals which was Suárez's third hat-trick against Norwich in three seasons and extended his run to eleven goals in five games against Norwich. Three days after their mauling at Liverpool, Norwich were again on the road travelling to West Bromwich Albion where goals from Gary Hooper and Leroy Fer saw them climb up to 14th in the table. The return to Carrow Road for the match against Swansea City saw Hooper score his fourth goal in six games to equalise following Nathan Dyer's opener. The final game before Christmas saw Norwich travel to the Stadium of Light where the goalless draw saw reach Norwich 19 points, six points clear of the relegation zone, and ensure that Sunderland went into Christmas three points adrift of {{the bottom of the}} table. Hooper scored his fifth goal in eight games in a Boxing Day defeat by Fulham. The year finished poorly with a 0–1 home defeat by defending champions Manchester United seeing the Canaries <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>only</b> two points from a possible twelve.|$|E
500|$|... "Goodbye, Michael" [...] {{features}} several {{references to}} previous episodes. During one scene, Michael puts his Dundie on his desk, a {{homage to the}} final shot in the series opening sequence.

[...] It also featured the reforming of the Party Planning Committee after being broken up in [...] "Moroccan Christmas", and briefly showed Creed's continual habit of using the women's bathroom as seen in [...] "Women's Appreciation". Michael gives Darryl his book [...] "Somehow I Manage", which was originally mentioned in [...] "Happy Hour." [...] Two callbacks are made to the episode [...] "Christmas Party": Phyllis' gift to Michael being homemade sewn mittens and Dwight wanting to play paintball with Michael. Michael's goodbye to Pam serves as a homage to a scene in the British version of The Office, where Tim Canterbury proclaims his love for Dawn Tinsley in a meeting room, but Tim turns off his microphone first so the cameras <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>only</b> their reactions and no sound. This scene was also referenced in the fifth season finale, [...] "Company Picnic".|$|E

2500|$|Historically, only [...] "medallion taxis," [...] those {{painted in}} {{distinctive}} yellow paint and {{regulated by the}} TLC, are permitted to pick up passengers {{in response to a}} street hail.

2500|$|Liuzzo {{was born}} Viola Fauver Gregg on April 11, 1925, {{in the small}} town of California, Pennsylvania, the elder {{daughter}} of Eva Wilson, a teacher, and Heber Ernest Gregg, a coal miner and World War I veteran. He left school in the eighth grade but taught himself to read. Her mother, Eva Wilson Gregg, had a teaching certificate from the University of Pittsburgh. The couple had one other daughter, Rose Mary, in 1930. [...] While on the job, Heber's right hand was blown off in a mine explosion, and, during the Great Depression, the Greggs became solely dependent on Eva’s income. [...] Work was very hard to come by for Mrs. Gregg, as she could <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>only</b> sporadic, short-term, teaching positions. [...] The family descended further into poverty and decided to move from Georgia to Chattanooga, Tennessee, where Eva Gregg found a teaching position, when Viola was six.|$|E
2500|$|Historically, only yellow {{medallion}} taxicabs {{were permitted}} to pick up passengers {{in response to a}} street hail. The TLC also regulates and licenses for-hire vehicles, known as [...] "car services" [...] or [...] "livery cabs," [...] which are prohibited from picking up street hails (although this rule is less often enforced in the boroughs outside Manhattan) and are supposed to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>only</b> those customers who have called the car service's dispatcher and requested a car. Following state legislation passed in 2011, the TLC voted in April 2012 to allow livery cabs to be licensed to make street pick-ups in the outer boroughs and northern Manhattan, a rule in effect starting in summer 2012. The implementation was held up with litigation, but on June 6, 2013, the New York State Court of Appeals, the State's highest court, found that the regulation of taxicabs was a compelling state interest, and that therefore the New York Legislature had acted within its rights when it authorized the new class of taxis. The Taxi and Limousine Commission plans to authorize up to 6,000 cabs per year for three years, ultimately creating a total of 18,000 green taxis. They first appeared in August 2013.|$|E
