50|$|After {{three weeks}} of imprisonment, no {{specific}} charges were brought against Mary and Molly. As a result, the cousins were released from Castle Thunder. They were not <b>permitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>re-enter</b> the army, and were instead sent back on their horses to Pulaski, dressed in the same Confederate uniforms {{in which they were}} imprisoned.|$|R
50|$|After {{the main}} active Camisard groups had been subdued in various ways, the French {{authorities}} were keen not to re-ignite the revolt {{and took a}} more moderate approach to anti-Protestant repression. Many former Camisards came back to a more peaceful approach and from 1715 onwards helped re-establish a still illegal but now much better organised Protestantism. They were {{under the leadership of}} Antoine Court and of the numerous travelling pastors who were <b>permitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>re-enter</b> the country.|$|R
5000|$|The Re-entry Permit (Form I-327), {{also known}} as <b>Permit</b> <b>to</b> <b>Re-Enter</b> is a travel {{document}} similar to a certificate of identity, issued by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services to U.S. lawful permanent residents {{to allow them to}} travel abroad and return to the U.S. It is a passport-like booklet with a blue-green cover with the words [...] "TRAVEL DOCUMENT" [...] on the front.|$|E
50|$|On March 10, 2009, Bell and {{his wife}} and {{daughter}} left Nevada for Manila to deal with some family business including the disposition of a condo they owned. Shortly thereafter, the USCIS denied the application {{on the grounds that the}} documentary evidence was never received, and further stipulated that Airyn Bell is not <b>permitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>re-enter</b> the United States, which is why Bell remains in the Philippines. Moreover, since the Bells were out of the country when the application was denied, they must start the process all over again.|$|R
50|$|Upon the {{outbreak}} of revolt he fled, wandering for some time among the wilds of Normandy before he was arrested at Granville. At his trial before the chamber of peers he was condemned and sentenced to 'perpetual' imprisonment at the château in Ham. But he benefited by the amnesty of 1836, when the sentence was commuted to exile. During his captivity he wrote Considerations politiques (1832). Afterwards, he spent several years in exile in England before being <b>permitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>re-enter</b> France on condition that he never again take up his abode in Paris.|$|R
50|$|Speculation on {{the exact}} polling date was rife, as {{political}} analysts expected polling to be held after the Chinese New Year on 7 February and during the week-long school holidays from 7 to 16 March, as schools {{will be available for}} use as polling stations. Political analysts saw a March election as an attempt by the Prime Minister to garner a fresh mandate before a slowdown in the global and Malaysian economies, and in an effort to bar Anwar Ibrahim from contesting, as he is <b>permitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>re-enter</b> politics on 14 April 2008.|$|R
50|$|On 23 October 2002, the {{provision}} in the Constitution of Italy that barred male members of the former royal house from returning to Italy was repealed. As part of {{a deal with the}} government, Vittorio Emanuel signed an agreement recognizing the Republic as the valid government of the state and renouncing all claims to the defunct throne. Vittorio Emanuele was <b>permitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>re-enter</b> the country from 10 November 2002. On 23 December 2002, he made his first trip home in over half a century. On the one-day visit he, his wife and his son had a 20-minute audience with Pope John Paul II at the Vatican.|$|R
25|$|The Yankee Stadium {{staff was}} also criticized for an {{incident}} during a May 4, 2009 game, which {{was interrupted by}} a rain delay. Fans were told by some staff members that the game was unlikely to resume and consequently, many fans exited the stadium, only for the game to eventually resume play. The fans that left the ballpark were not <b>permitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>re-enter,</b> per the stadium's re-entry policy, and many subsequently got into arguments with stadium personnel. In response to the backlash the Yankees received for the incident, the staff members were required to sign a gag order preventing them from speaking to media, but they did indicate that communication for rain delays would be improved.|$|R
25|$|During {{his first}} trip to England in January 1968, Captain Beefheart was briefly {{represented}} in the UK by mod icon Peter Meaden, an early manager of the Who. The Captain and his band members were initially denied entry to the United Kingdom, because Meaden had illegally booked them for gigs without applying for appropriate work <b>permits.</b> After returning <b>to</b> Germany for a few days, the group was <b>permitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>re-enter</b> the UK, when they recorded material for John Peel's radio show and appeared at the Middle Earth venue, introduced by Peel on Saturday January 20. By this time, they had terminated their association with Meaden. On January 27, 1968, Beefheart performed in the MIDEM Music Festival on the beach at Cannes, France.|$|R
50|$|Flowers' {{actions have}} also {{led him into}} trouble. He was once barred from {{attending}} an Ashes match at Headingley Stadium in 2009 by the England and Wales Cricket Board but due to intervention from Yorkshire County Cricket Club Chief Executive Stewart Regan, this was overturned. In addition, later in 2009 when attending a Test match in Durban, South Africa with the Barmy Army, Flowers was attacked by two men who knocked {{him to the ground}} and then hit him with a flag. He was once ejected from the Adelaide Oval by the police during the 2010-11 Ashes series for being lifted onto fans shoulders but was <b>permitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>re-enter</b> later in the game after an angry reaction at his ejection from England fans.|$|R

This article {{considers}} {{the law on}} restraint of trade both at common law, and under the Trade Practices Act, and its relevance to sporting disputes.

500|$|Rotblat {{was able}} to show that much of the {{information}} within the dossier had been fabricated. In addition, FBI records show that in 1950, Rotblat's friend in Santa Fe was tracked down in California, and she flatly denied the story; the cheque had never been cashed and had been left to pay for items not available in the U.K. during the war. In 1985, Rotblat recounted how a box containing [...] "all my documents" [...] went missing on a train ride from Washington D.C. to New York as he was leaving the country, but the presence of large numbers of Rotblat's personal papers from Los Alamos now archived at the Churchill Archives Centre [...] "is totally at odds with Rotblat's account of events". Due to suspicions that he was a Soviet spy, Rotblat was not <b>permitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>re-enter</b> the United States until 1964.|$|R
2500|$|Regarding the Manchester Arena bombing, Hopkins {{wrote that}} [...] "Britain {{is faced with}} some hard {{questions}} the people charged with protecting {{us are going to}} have to answer sooner or later". [...] Hopkins asserted that the suicide bomber, Salman Abedi, was known to the police, and questioned how he was <b>permitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>re-enter</b> Britain unchallenged after visiting Libya. [...] "Our leaders allow such deeply suspicious characters back into Britain," [...] wrote Hopkins, [...] "and then expect us to swallow their lies that we will not give in to terror?" [...] Hopkins also tweeted about the need for a [...] "final solution", the Nazis' term for the Holocaust, on the morning following the May 2017 Manchester Arena bombing. Although the tweet was soon deleted and reworded as a [...] "true solution", Hopkins claimed the original was only a typographical error (she had also misspelled Manchester). The motive for the attack, and the background of the suicide bomber, was unknown at the time Hopkins made the comment.|$|R

40|$|The {{rhetoric of}} the virtual stubbornly clings to digital culture, even though our {{experience}} of working within it is of a resisting medium that only behaves in certain ways. The persistence of the virtual demands attention: why do we cling to such a description even while we quite willingly recognise the interpenetration of the world beyond the monitor and that represented on it? In education we’re encouraged to use Virtual Learning Environments, as if somehow these spaces are not as real as classrooms; we participate (or read about others participating) in virtual worlds such as Second Life or World of Warcraft, places that imitate the real world, providing access to fantasies that are underpinned by very real economics; and we exploit the World Wide Web, believing in its textual metaphors (pages, hypertext) while ignoring its presence as a medium. In my contribution to this forum I {{want to suggest that}} our insistence on the immateriality of digital culture enforces an ontological distinction that overdetermines the materiality of the world beyond the monitor while misrecognizing the new things that are displayed upon it. Rather than continue to use the virtual as a category, I would like to argue using an alternative term, the apparition. 1 Unlike the virtual, which foregrounds its effect of the real with reality itself present only as absence, apparition has two meanings: the first is an immaterial appearance, a ghostly presence that, like the virtual, can signal an absent materiality; the second is simply the appearance of something, specifically the emergence of something into history. It is this latter meaning, I suggest, that <b>permits</b> materiality <b>to</b> <b>re-enter</b> digital discourse...|$|R
