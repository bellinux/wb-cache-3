60|$|X. Inscriptions appear {{sometimes}} {{to be introduced}} {{for the sake of}} the scroll on which they are written; and in late and modern painted glass, as well as in architecture, these scrolls are flourished and turned hither and thither as if they were ornamental. Ribands occur frequently in arabesques,--in some of a high order, too,--tying up flowers, or flitting in and out among the fixed forms. Is there anything like ribands in nature? It might be thought that grass and sea-weed afforded apologetic types. They do not. There is a wide difference between their structure and that of a riband. They have a skeleton, an anatomy, a central rib, or fibre, or framework of some kind or another, which has a beginning and an end, a root and head, and whose make and strength effects every direction of their motion, and every line of their form. The loosest weed that drifts and waves under the heaving of the sea, or hangs heavily on the brown and slippery shore, has a marked strength, structure, elasticity, gradation of substance; its extremities are more finely fibred than its centre, its centre than its root; every fork of its ramification is measured and proportioned; every wave of its languid lines is love. It has its allotted size, and place, and function; it is a specific creature. What is there like this in a riband? It has no structure: it is a succession of cut threads all alike; it has no skeleton, no make, no form, no size, no will of its own. You cut it and crush it into what you will. It has no strength, no languor. It cannot fall into a single graceful form. It cannot wave, in the true sense, but only flutter: it cannot bend, in the true sense, but only turn and be wrinkled. It is a vile thing; it spoils all that is near its wretched film of an existence. Never use it. Let the flowers come loose if they cannot keep together without being tied; leave the sentence unwritten if you cannot write it on a tablet or book, or <b>plain</b> <b>roll</b> of paper. I know what authority there is against me. I remember the scrolls of Perugino's angels, and the ribands of Raphael's arabesques, and of Ghiberti's glorious bronze flowers: no matter; they are every one of them vices and uglinesses. Raphael usually felt this, and used an honest and rational tablet, as in the Madonna di Fuligno. I do not say there is any type of such tablets in nature, but all the difference lies in the fact that the tablet is not considered as an ornament, and the riband, or flying scroll, is. The tablet, as in Albert Durer's Adam and Eve, is introduced {{for the sake of the}} writing, understood and allowed as an ugly but necessary interruption. The scroll is extended as an ornamental form, which it is not, nor ever can be.|$|E

60|$|XXVII. This rule of {{supremacy}} {{applies to}} the smallest {{as well as to}} the leading features: it is interestingly seen in the arrangement of all good mouldings. I have given one, on the opposite page, from Rouen cathedral; that of the tracery before distinguished as a type of the noblest manner of Northern Gothic (Chap. II. § XXII.). It is a tracery of three orders, of which the first is divided into a leaf moulding, fig. 4, and b in the section, and a <b>plain</b> <b>roll,</b> also seen in fig. 4, c in the section; these two divisions surround the entire window or panelling, and are carried by two-face shafts of corresponding sections. The second and third orders are plain rolls following the line of the tracery; four divisions of moulding in all: of these four, the leaf moulding is, as seen in the sections, much the largest; next to it the outer roll; then, by an exquisite alternation, the innermost roll (e), in order that it may not be lost in the recess and the intermediate (d), the smallest. Each roll has its own shaft and capital; and the two smaller, which in effect upon the eye, owing to the retirement of the innermost, are nearly equal, have smaller capitals than the two larger, lifted a little to bring them to the same level. The wall in the trefoiled lights is curved, as from e to f in the section; but in the quatrefoil it is flat, only thrown back to the full depth of the recess below so as to get a sharp shadow instead of a soft one, the mouldings falling back to it in nearly a vertical curve behind the roll e. This could not, however, be managed with the simpler mouldings of the smaller quatrefoil above, whose half section is given from g to g2; but the architect was evidently fretted by the heavy look of its circular foils as opposed to the light spring of the arches below: so he threw its cusps obliquely clear from the wall, as seen in fig. 2, attached to it where they meet the circle, but with their finials pushed out from the natural level (h, in the section) to that of the first order (g2) and supported by stone props behind, as seen in the profile fig. 2, which I got from the correspondent panel on the buttress face (fig. 1 being on its side), and of which the lower cusps, being broken away, show the remnant of one of their props projecting from the wall. The oblique curve thus obtained in the profile is of singular grace. Take it all in all, I have never met with a more exquisite piece of varied, yet severe, proportioned and general arrangement (though all the windows of the period are fine, and especially delightful in the subordinate proportioning of the smaller capitals to the smaller shafts). The only fault it has is the inevitable misarrangement of the central shafts; for the enlargement of the inner roll, though beautiful in the group of four divisions at the side, causes, in the triple central shaft, the very awkwardness of heavy lateral members which has just been in most instances condemned. In the windows of the choir, and in most of the period, this difficulty is avoided by making the fourth order a fillet which only follows the foliation, while the three outermost are nearly in arithmetical progression of size, and the central triple shaft has of course the largest roll in front. The moulding of the Palazzo Foscari (Plate VIII., and Plate IV. fig. 8) is, for so simple a group, the grandest in effect I have even seen: it is composed of a large roll with two subordinates.|$|E

In Texas and across their range, Northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) habitat frequently overlaps cultivated cropland protected by neonicotinoids. To address the effects of neonicotinoid use on bobwhites in Texas, we conducted a historical analysis from 1978 ? 2012 in Texas? ecological regions using quail count data collected from North American Breeding Bird Survey and Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, and neonicotinoid use data from the U.

40|$|The {{widespread}} use of neonicotinoid insecticides {{in recent years has}} led to increasing environmental concern, including impacts to avian populations. In Texas and across their range, Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus; hereafter bobwhite) habitat frequently overlaps with agricultural areas of known neonicotinoid use. To address the impacts of neonicotinoids on bobwhites in Texas, we developed the following research objectives: (1) Conduct statistical analysis of bobwhite abundance and neonicotinoid use in Texas over the last 35 years, and (2) Analyze bobwhite samples collected from three field sites across the state for neonicotinoid residues and signs of tissue damage. Generalized linear, generalized additive, mixed-effects, zero-inflated, and hurdle models were used to analyze long-term data on bobwhite abundance, neonicotinoid use, and environmental variables from 1978 - 2012. Statewide analysis indicates that total neonicotinoid use is negatively correlated with quail abundance in the periods after neonicotinoid introduction (1994 - 2003) and after their {{widespread use}} (2004 - 2012). Analysis by ecoregion provided further support for the significant negative relationship between bobwhites and neonicotinoids in areas of high-use (e. g. High <b>Plains,</b> <b>Rolling</b> <b>Plains,</b> and Gulf Coast Prairies and Marshes). Approximately 10 bobwhites were collected from three field sites in Fall 2014 and Spring 2015, for a total of 61 birds. Neonicotinoid compounds were detected in trace amounts in the livers of seven quail, including samples from all three field sites and both collecting periods. Signs of testicular degeneration (n = 2) and lipid-type hepatocellular vacuolation (n= 8) were consistent with known results of neonicotinoid intoxication. Overall, we identified evidence of bobwhite exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides, and our statistical analysis indicates that neonicotinoid use may be contributing to quail decline in some ecoregions in Texas...|$|R

Poor quality of ridge impressions, small finger area, and large nonlinear distortion are the main difficulties in latent fingerprint matching compared to <b>plain</b> or <b>rolled</b> fingerprint matching.

In addition to minutiae, we also use extended features, including singularity, ridge quality map, ridge flow map, ridge wavelength map, and skeleton. We tested our system by matching 258 latents in the NIST SD 27 database against a background database of 29, 257 rolled fingerprints obtained by combining the NIST SD 4, SD 14, and SD 27 databases. The minutiae-based baseline rank- 1 identification rate of 34. 9 percent was improved to 74 percent when extended features were used. In order to evaluate the relative importance of each extended feature, these features were incrementally used in the order of their cost in marking by latent experts.

40|$|The Texas Plains, {{which include}} the Texas High <b>Plains</b> and <b>Rolling</b> <b>Plains,</b> {{is one of the}} largest cotton growing areas in the world. Cotton {{cultivation}} in this region is facing severe challenges from rapidly declining groundwater levels and increasing number of droughts. Projected changes in climate are expected to further add to the uncertainty of cotton production in this region. The overall goal of this research was to study the effects of climate change on cotton yield using the CROPGRO-Cotton Cropping System Model (CSM) within the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT). The future (2041 - 2070) climate data generated by three Regional Climate Models (RCMs), namely RCM 3 -GFDL, RCM 3 -CGCM 3 and CRCM-CCSM was obtained from the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP) and was bias corrected using Distribution mapping techniques. The CROPGRO-Cotton model was calibrated, validated and further evaluated using the observed data collected from cotton experiments at Chillicothe in the Texas <b>Rolling</b> <b>Plains</b> during the years 2008 and 2012. A GIS-based distributed modeling approach was used to predict cotton yields across major cotton-growing counties in the Texas Plains under historic and future climate scenarios using the calibrated CROPGRO-Cotton CSM. The RCMs predicted an overall decrease in the average rainfall (30 to 127 mm), increase in the intensity of extreme rainfall events (4 % to 14 % as per RCM 3 -GFDL), and increase in both minimum (1. 9 to 2. 9 ?C) and maximum temperatures (2. 0 to 3. 2 ?C) (as per three RCMs) in the future. Deficit irrigation simulations indicated that the maximum seed cotton yields under normal and dry weather conditions could be achieved at 100 % and 110 % ET replacement scenarios, respectively. The cotton yield at Chillicothe was projected to decrease within a range of 2 % to 14. 9 % under the three RCM future climate scenarios. Majority of the counties in the Texas Plains showed a decline in average cotton yield within a range of 2 % to 20 % under RCM 3 -GFDL projected future climate scenario, with the counties in the Texas <b>Rolling</b> <b>Plains</b> being the most affected.
