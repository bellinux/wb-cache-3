5|$|Subdivision {{surfaces}} in computer graphics use subdivision rules to refine a surface to any given level of precision. These subdivision surfaces (such as the Catmull-Clark subdivision surface) take a <b>polygon</b> <b>mesh</b> (the kind used in 3D animated movies) and refines it to a mesh with more polygons by adding and shifting points according to different recursive formulas. Although many points get shifted in this process, each new mesh is combinatorially a subdivision {{of the old}} mesh (meaning that for every edge and vertex of the old mesh, you can identify a corresponding edge and vertex in the new one, plus several more edges and vertices).|$|E
5|$|The Agni's Philosophy tech demo {{was running}} at 60 frames per second, used 1.8 GB of texture data per frame, and pushed ten million polygons per frame, with {{approximately}} 300,000 to 400,000 polygons for each character model. The entire {{city in the}} demo was tessellated. There is a scene where 100,000 illuminated firefly-like insects appear on screen, each one a full <b>polygon</b> <b>mesh</b> model with body and wings, which proceed to merge to generate a summoned monster. Production for the demo began in June 2011, and was initially produced as pre-rendered CGI animation by Visual Works before Square Enix attempted to reproduce it entirely in real-time with the Luminous Studio engine, using the same assets as the CGI version.|$|E
25|$|The Acorn Archimedes version, ArcElite (1991), {{written by}} Warren Burch & Clive Gringras and {{regarded}} by Stuff magazine {{as the best}} conversion of the original game, added intelligent opponents who engage in their own private battles and police who take an active interest in protecting the law. As well as such gameplay enhancements, the version also exploited the more modern hardware by using <b>polygon</b> <b>mesh</b> graphics {{in place of the}} wire-frames. The game world no longer seems to be centred around the player; freighter fleets with escorts go about their own business, pirate formations patrol lawless systems looking for cargo to loot and mining ships can often be found breaking up asteroids for their mineral content. Unlike the mythical Generation Ships of the original, rare occurrences of other non-pirate entities mentioned in the manual really {{can be found in the}} Archimedes version: geometric formations of space beacons; hermits living among the asteroids; abandoned ships towed by police (although Dredgers and Generation Ships are confirmed not to exist in Archimedes Elite). The Archimedes version of Elite was originally written to be a space trading game called Trojan - however the obvious similarities eventually meant that to avoid a potential lawsuit Trojan had to become an official Elite conversion. ArcElite was one of a number of games released for free by The Icon Bar website in 2006.|$|E
50|$|The {{study of}} <b>polygon</b> <b>meshes</b> {{is a large}} {{sub-field}} of computer graphics and geometric modeling. Different representations of <b>polygon</b> <b>meshes</b> are used for different applications and goals. The variety of operations performed on meshes may include Boolean logic, smoothing, simplification, and many others. Volumetric meshes are distinct from <b>polygon</b> <b>meshes</b> in that they explicitly represent both the surface and volume of a structure, while <b>polygon</b> <b>meshes</b> only explicitly represent the surface (the volume is implicit). As polygonal meshes are extensively used in computer graphics, algorithms also exist for ray tracing, collision detection, and rigid-body dynamics of <b>polygon</b> <b>meshes.</b>|$|R

Using <b>Polygon</b> <b>Meshed</b> PO, the calculation of the induced current and the scattered field can be systematically simplified by summing the contribution on each triangle. Furthermore, the parametric study and the analytical solutions including integral equation (IE) techniques were introduced in order to evaluate the performance of this method...|$|R

500|$|Development of {{the game}} began in January 1998, {{spanning}} two years with manpower that steadily increased from 20 to 50 at peak development phase. The storyline conceived for the game follows Ashley Riot's origins as a dedicated government agent prior to being the titular [...] "vagrant" [...] who is [...] "involved in many incidents" [...] after the events in Le√° Monde. Inspiration for the plot is derived from Hollywood [...] "classic and blockbuster" [...] films as well as European and Asian films. The gameplay was conceived to cater to hardcore gamers who do not [...] "ask for hints and read through strategy guides". However, Matsuno revealed that over half {{of the game}}'s story was cut due to capacity and development time constraints. Memory issues was considered the most challenging aspect of the game development, with the team forced to adjust the game's interface, texture mapping and <b>polygon</b> <b>mesh</b> in maps, as well as removing gaming elements such as AI-controlled supporting non-player characters that would have joined Ashley {{in the middle of the}} game.|$|E
2500|$|Any {{surface is}} {{modelled}} as a tessellation called <b>polygon</b> <b>mesh.</b> If a square mesh has [...] points (vertices) per side, there are n squared squares in the mesh, or 2n squared triangles {{since there are}} two triangles in a square. There are [...] vertices per triangle. Where n is large, this approaches one half. Or, each vertex inside the square mesh connects four edges (lines).|$|E

We also contrast and compare two polygon remeshing techniques based on the ellipsoidal surfaces and the segmentation boundaries...|$|R
50|$|T-splines, {{subdivision}} surfaces, NURBS surfaces, and <b>polygon</b> <b>meshes</b> are alternative technologies. Subdivision surfaces, {{as well as}} T-spline and NURBS surfaces {{with the}} addition of geometrically continuous constructions, can represent everywhere-smooth surfaces of any connectivity and topology, such as holes, branches, and handles. However, none of T-splines, subdivision surfaces, NURBS surfaces can always accurately represent the (exact, algebraic) intersection of two surfaces within the same surface representation. <b>Polygon</b> <b>meshes</b> can represent exact intersections but lack the shape quality required in industrial design. Subdivision surfaces are widely adopted in the animation industry. Pixar's variant of the subdivision surfaces has the advantage of edge weights. T-splines do not yet have edge weights.|$|R
