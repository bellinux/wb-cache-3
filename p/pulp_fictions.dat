[...] Corliss later named it the 10th best film of 2007.

2500|$|Principal {{photography}} commenced on September 20, 1993. The lead offscreen talent had {{all worked}} with Tarantino on Reservoir Dogs— cinematographer Andrzej Sekuła, film editor Sally Menke, production designer David Wasco, and costume designer Betsy Heimann. According to Tarantino, [...] "e had $8 million [...] I {{wanted it to}} look like a $20–25 million movie. I wanted it {{to look like a}}n epic. It's an epic in everything— in invention, in ambition, in length, in scope, in everything except the price tag." [...] The film, he says, was shot [...] "on 50 ASA film stock, which is the slowest stock they make. The reason we use it is that it creates an almost no-grain image, it's lustrous. It's the closest thing we have to 50s Technicolor." [...] The largest chunk of the budget— $150,000— went to creating the Jack Rabbit Slim's set. It was built in a Culver City warehouse, where it was joined by several other sets, as well as the film's production offices. The diner sequence was shot on location in Hawthorne at the Hawthorne Grill, known for its Googie architecture. For the costumes, Tarantino took his inspiration from French director Jean-Pierre Melville, who believed that the clothes his characters wore were their symbolic suits of armor. Tarantino cast himself in a modest-sized role as he had in Reservoir Dogs. One of his pop totems, Fruit Brute, a long-discontinued General Mills cereal, also returned from the earlier film. The shoot wrapped on November 30. Before <b>Pulp</b> <b>Fictions</b> premiere, Tarantino convinced Avary to forfeit his agreed-on cowriting credit and accept a [...] "story by" [...] credit, so the line [...] "Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino" [...] could be used in advertising and onscreen.|$|E
2500|$|Paula Rabinowitz {{expresses the}} general film {{industry}} opinion that Pulp Fiction [...] "simultaneously resurrected John Travolta and film noir". In Peter Biskind's description, {{it created a}} [...] "guys-with-guns frenzy". The film has also been labeled as a black comedy and a [...] "neo-noir". Critic Geoffrey O'Brien, however, argued against the classification of Pulp Fiction into the neo-noir genre: [...] "The old-time noir passions, the brooding melancholy and operatic death scenes, would be altogether {{out of place in}} the crisp and brightly lit wonderland that Tarantino conjures up. [...] neither neo-noir nor a parody of noir." [...] Similarly, Nicholas Christopher calls it [...] "more gangland camp than neo-noir", and Foster Hirsch suggests that its [...] "trippy fantasy landscape" [...] characterizes it more definitively than any genre label. Regardless, the stylistic influence of Pulp Fiction soon became apparent. Less than a year after the picture's release, British critic Jon Ronson attended the National Film School's end-of-semester screenings and assessed the impact: [...] "Out of the five student movies I watched, four incorporated violent shoot-outs over a soundtrack of iconoclastic 70s pop hits, two climaxed with all the main characters shooting each other at once, and one had two hitmen discussing the idiosyncrasies of The Brady Bunch before offing their victim. Not since Citizen Kane has one man appeared from relative obscurity to redefine the art of moviemaking." [...] Among the first Hollywood films cited as its imitators were Destiny Turns on the Radio (1995), in which Tarantino acted, Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead (1995), and 2 Days in the Valley (1996). It [...] "triggered a myriad of clones", writes Fiona Villella. Internationally, according to David Desser, it [...] "not only influenced a British brand of noir, but extended the noir vision virtually around the world." [...] <b>Pulp</b> <b>Fictions</b> effect on film form was still reverberating in 2007, when David Denby of The New Yorker credited it with initiating the ongoing cycle of disordered cinematic narratives.|$|E
