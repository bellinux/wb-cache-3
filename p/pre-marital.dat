25|$|After {{the arrival}} of the Europeans, a Christian {{marriage}} took place before the traditional rites, or was inserted between them. Fakafefine kept a low profile. Commoners adopted the ideal of <b>pre-marital</b> virginity and the display of bloody bedclothing. Divorce theoretically became formal, and difficult, though this may have only slightly discouraged informal separations and subsequent common-law unions.|$|E
25|$|O’Sullivan and {{her colleagues}} {{assessed}} 180 girls {{between the ages of}} 12 and 14 on their perceptions on what their first sexual encounters would be like; many girls reported feeling negative emotions towards sex before their first time. The researchers think this is because adolescent girls are taught that society views adolescent <b>pre-marital</b> sex in negative terms. When they reported positive feelings, the most commonly listed one was feeling attractive. This shows how many girls objectify their own bodies and often think about this before they think of their own sexual desires and needs.|$|E
25|$|In the West, sex before {{marriage}} is not illegal. There are social taboos and many religions condemn <b>pre-marital</b> sex. In many Muslim countries, such as Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Kuwait, Maldives, Morocco, Oman, Mauritania, United Arab Emirates, Sudan, Yemen, {{any form of}} sexual activity outside marriage is illegal. Those found guilty, especially women, {{may be forced to}} wed the sexual partner, publicly beaten, or stoned to death. In many African and native tribes, sexual activity is not viewed as a privilege or right of a married couple, but rather as the unification of bodies and is thus not frowned upon.|$|E
25|$|In {{the past}} China {{promoted}} eugenics {{as part of}} its population planning policies, but the government has backed away from such policies, as evidenced by China's ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which compels the nation to significantly reform its genetic testing laws. Recent research has also emphasized the necessity of understanding a myriad of complex social relations that affect the meaning of informed consent in China. Furthermore, in 2003, China revised its marriage registration regulations and couples no longer have to submit to a <b>pre-marital</b> physical or genetic examination before being granted a marriage license.|$|E
25|$|According to a 2005 World Health Organization estimate, about 97.9% of Somalia's {{women and}} girls {{underwent}} Female genital mutilation, a <b>pre-marital</b> custom mainly endemic to Northeast Africa {{and parts of the}} Near East. Encouraged by women in the community, it is primarily intended to protect chastity, deter promiscuity, and offer protection from assault. By 2013, UNICEF in conjunction with the Somali authorities reported that the prevalence rate among 1- to 14-year-old girls in the autonomous northern Puntland and Somaliland regions had dropped to 25% following a social and religious awareness campaign. About 93% of Somalia's male population is also reportedly circumcised.|$|E
25|$|One common {{cultural}} practice, {{irrespective of}} religion or economic status, is female genital mutilation (FGM), {{also known as}} female genital cutting (FGC), a procedure that involves partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. The practice has been made illegal in Ethiopia in 2004. FGM is a <b>pre-marital</b> custom mainly endemic to Northeast Africa {{and parts of the}} Near East that has its ultimate origins in Ancient Egypt. Encouraged by women in the community, it is primarily intended to deter promiscuity and to offer protection from assault.|$|E
25|$|The {{husband is}} financially {{responsible}} for the welfare and maintenance of his wife or wives and any children they produce, to include at a minimum, providing a home, food and clothing. In return, {{it is the duty}} of the wife to safeguard the husband's possessions and protect how wealth is spent. If the wife has wealth in her own capacity she is not obliged to spend it upon the husband or children, as she can own property and assets in her own right, so the husband has no right for her property and assets except by her will. A <b>pre-marital</b> agreement of the financial expectation from the husband is in the mahr, given by him to the wife for her exclusive use, which is included as part of his financial responsibility.|$|E
25|$|The second {{approach}} {{fell into}} the category of conditional marriages, t'nai b'kiddushin, and was based in part on past approaches used by both the French and Turkish rabbinates—but, according to Rabinowitz—had improvements gleaned from lessons learned from those past experiences. The ketubah was not changed, but a separate <b>pre-marital</b> agreement was signed, and {{in the presence of the}} rabbinical court, the prospective groom read it, and the prospective bride stated that she agreed to it. The agreement was that the parties understood that if a civil divorce were ever granted, then a get must be delivered within six months of that date. A refusal to abide by that agreement would give the court no choice but to consider the original marriage, and the original declaration of the groom, so flawed that it would be as if that marriage never occurred.|$|E
25|$|The first, {{beginning}} in the 1950s, was {{the inclusion of the}} Lieberman clause, named for Talmudic scholar and Jewish Theological Seminary (JTS) professor Saul Lieberman, in the ketuba, requiring that a get be granted if a civil divorce is ever issued. Most Orthodox rabbis have rejected the Lieberman clause, although leaders of the Conservative movement claim that the original intent was to find a solution that could be used by Orthodox and Conservative rabbis alike, and that leaders of Orthodox Judaism's Rabbinical Council of America, and respected Orthodox rabbis, including Joseph B. Soloveitchik, supposedly recognized the clause as valid. Later, because some civil courts viewed the enforcement of a religious document as a violation of the constitutional principle of {{the separation of church and}} state, Conservative rabbis began to require couples to sign a separate letter, stating that the clause had been explained to them as part of <b>pre-marital</b> counseling, and that both parties understood and agreed to its conditions, recognizing that this letter would constitute a separate civil document, enforceable in a civilian court. However, many Conservative rabbis, including some on the movement's own law committee, had growing misgivings about the clause for religious reasons.|$|E
25|$|Because the Pill was so effective, {{and soon}} so widespread, it also {{heightened}} {{the debate about}} the moral and health consequences of <b>pre-marital</b> sex and promiscuity. Never before had sexual activity been so divorced from reproduction. For a couple using the Pill, intercourse became purely an expression of love, or a means of physical pleasure, or both; but it was no longer a means of reproduction. While this was true of previous contraceptives, their relatively high failure rates and their less widespread use failed to emphasize this distinction as clearly as did the Pill. The spread of oral contraceptive use thus led many religious figures and institutions to debate the proper role of sexuality and its relationship to procreation. The Roman Catholic Church in particular, after studying the phenomenon of oral contraceptives, re-emphasized the stated teaching on birth control in the 1968 papal encyclical Humanae vitae. The encyclical reiterated the established Catholic teaching that artificial contraception distorts the nature and purpose of sex. On the other side Anglican and other Protestant churches, such as the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD) accepted the combined oral contraceptive pill.|$|E
25|$|Evidence from slaves {{is rarely}} viable {{in a court}} of law. As slaves are {{regarded}} as inferior in Islamic law, death {{at the hands of a}} free man does not require that the latter be killed in retaliation. The killer must pay the slave's master compensation equivalent to the slave's value, as opposed to blood-money. At the same time, slaves themselves possess a lessened responsibility for their actions, and receive half the penalty required upon a free man. For example: where a free man would be subject to a hundred lashes due to <b>pre-marital</b> relations, a slave would be subject to only fifty. Slaves are allowed to marry only with the owner's consent. Jurists differ over how many wives a slave may possess, with the Hanafi and Shafi'i schools allowing them two, and the Maliki school allowing four. Slaves are not permitted to possess or inherit property, or conduct independent business, and may conduct financial dealings only as a representative of the master. Offices of authority are generally not permitted for slaves, though a slave may act as the leader (Imam) in the congregational prayers, and he may also act as a subordinate officer in the governmental department of revenue. Masters may sell, bequeath, give away, pledge, hire out or compel them to earn money.|$|E

500|$|Before marriage, girls made dedications to Artemis, {{often of}} {{childhood}} toys and locks of hair. [...] Along with Artemis, girls made <b>pre-marital</b> sacrifices to Gaia and Uranus, the Erinyes and Moirai, {{and to their}} ancestors. [...] It was customary for the bride to bathe before her wedding; jars called loutrophoroi were used to draw the water, {{and many of these}} were afterwards dedicated to nymphs. [...] For instance, at a shrine to a nymph on the south slope of the Acropolis in Athens, many fragments of loutrophoroi have been discovered with the word Nymphe inscribed on them.|$|E
500|$|Speaking to James Oram, {{author of}} Neighbours: Behind the Scenes, Minogue thought the {{marriage}} would bring controversial subjects, such as <b>pre-marital</b> sex and HIV/AIDS, into focus. Donovan agreed, {{saying there was}} [...] "a valid moral point behind it." [...] Executive producer Reg Watson noted how each character in the show expressed {{a different point of}} view about the wedding. Some, like Scott's father Jim (Alan Dale), thought it was [...] "stupid" [...] for a couple just out of school to get married, while others, like Charlene's mother Madge (Anne Charleston), believed it was romantic. Watson believed the storyline would have repercussions for everyone.|$|E

Namrata Joshi of Outlook adds that she is unafraid to take risks and portray roles that [...] "none of her contemporaries {{have been able to}} do". Mukerji has garnered a reputation for playing roles that are a significant departure from the traditional portrayal of women in mainstream Indian cinema; in Hum Tum she played a widow who engages in <b>pre-marital</b> sex, in Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna she is involved in an extra-marital affair with a married man, and in Bichhoo and No One Killed Jessica she smokes, drinks, and utters expletives.|$|E
500|$|Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weeklys PopWatch complimented the episode, {{writing that}} [...] "the series finale of Smallville did what {{it needed to}} do: It {{completed}} the circuit on an epic coil of story that began 10 years ago." [...] Jensen was critical {{of the first half}} of the episode, noting that the <b>pre-marital</b> tension between Clark and Lois did not bode well for the story. However, he felt that the last 10 minutes made up for the slow parts in the episode. He ultimately concluded that the finale was [...] "radically cornball and goosebumpingly geektastic, and the fanboy in me was satisfied". Chris Carabott of IGN awarded the episode a 9.5 out of 10, citing an [...] "amazing" [...] episode. He argued that it [...] "succeeded in delivering the moments we wanted to see" [...] and that [...] "this finale delivered some of the most memorable moments of the series and successfully transformed Clark Kent into Superman". Nick McHatton of TV Fanatic awarded the episode five stars out of five, calling its resolution [...] "breath taking". McHatton praised the ending, noting that, [...] "I couldn’t have asked for a better ending than those seven years in the future" [...] and that the final shot was the scene he [...] "always imagined Smallville could end with".|$|E

2500|$|Prior {{winning and}} {{at the time of her}} {{crowning}} she dated a French University Chemistry student named Philippe Duke. She stated in a press conference in 1971 that she approved of <b>pre-marital</b> sex stating [...] "we must have lots of experience" [...] and that [...] "marriage is not a simple thing". Rizk would later claim that her comments were misquoted and what she really meant was she approved of <b>pre-marital</b> sex but only with someone you loved or planned to marry. She then got married to Ali Hassan Salameh, a Palestinian who was chief of operations for Black September and founder of Force 17. The couple spent their honeymoon in Hawaii, and then stayed at Disneyland. When Rizk got pregnant, she returned to Beirut. Salameh was killed in 1979 by the Mossad. Salameh had been identified as a key participant in the Munich massacre, and was killed as part of Operation Wrath of God. After a couple of years, the Miss Universe got married to the renowned Lebanese singer Walid Toufic in 1990, and has two children with him. She is a judge for the Miss Lebanon competitions.|$|E

2500|$|The {{blending}} of sexual and spiritual is portrayed in Hindu iconography, {{as seen in}} ubiquitous phallic and vaginal iconography in Hindu temples and for instance in the Kharjuraho and Konarak medieval temples, where thousands of couples having sex in endless positions, and with the gods, are carved in deep bas-relief. [...] However, these depictions of sex are not generally understood to be a license for free sexual practices, but are instead meant to celebrate procreation {{as an integral part}} of existence in the universe.

Allegedly Salameh was still married to his first wife Um Hassan when their affair began. The dates on which the pair married is widely disputed. Yasser Arafat was said to disapprove of their <b>pre-marital</b> relationship because it clearly broke traditional conservative Arab status quo and he remained hostile to Georgina Rizk due to that. Considering the main role the PLO played in allying with the Lebanese Muslims and Leftists against the Christians in Lebanon, her relationship with a PLO militant was not welcomed by her own Christian community either.

2500|$|Prior to {{the second}} world war, birth control was {{prohibited}} in many countries, and in the United States even the discussion of contraceptive methods sometimes led to prosecution under Comstock laws. [...] The history {{of the development of}} oral contraceptives is thus closely tied to the birth control movement and the efforts of activists Margaret Sanger, Mary Dennett, and Emma Goldman. Based on fundamental research performed by Gregory Pincus and synthetic methods for progesterone developed by Carl Djerassi at Syntex and by Frank Colton at G.D. Searle & Co., the first oral contraceptive, Enovid, was developed by E.D. Searle and Co. and approved by the FDA in 1960. [...] The original formulation incorporated vastly excessive doses of hormones, and caused severe side effects. [...] Nonetheless, by 1962, 1.2 million American women were on the pill, and by 1965 the number had increased to 6.5 million. The availability of a convenient form of temporary contraceptive led to dramatic changes in social mores including expanding the range of lifestyle options available to women, reducing the reliance of women on men for contraceptive practice, encouraging the delay of marriage, and increasing <b>pre-marital</b> co-habitation.|$|E

[...] Curran's attorneys argued that CUA did not follow proper procedures or its own policy statements in handling the case. In response, CUA claimed that the Vatican's actions against Curran trumped any campus-based policy or tenure rules.
