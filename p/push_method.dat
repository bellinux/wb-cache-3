Understanding biomechanical and physiological changes that occur when stroller running is needed to evaluate its health impact, yet the effects of stroller running have not been clearly presented. Here, three commonly used stroller <b>pushing</b> <b>methods</b> were investigated to detect potential changes in energetic cost and lower-limb kinematics. Sixteen individuals (M/F: 10 / 6) ran at self-selected speeds for 800 m under three stroller conditions (2 -Hands, 1 -Hand, and Push/Chase) and an independent running control. A significant decrease in speed (p = 0. 001) and stride length (p< 0. 001) was observed between the control and stroller conditions, however no significant change in energetic cost (p = 0. 080) or heart rate (p = 0. 393) was observed. Additionally, <b>pushing</b> <b>method</b> had a significant effect on speed (p = 0. 001) and stride length (p< 0. 001).

Thus, a <b>push</b> communication <b>method</b> consisting of subscription and notifica-tion phases {{has been proposed}} for delivering data to recipients in an asynchronous way. In addition, the <b>push</b> communication <b>method</b> aims to deliver the data to the recipients proactively and in a timely manner.

In this paper, we present an atomic force microscope (AFM) based approach for automated manipulation of nanoparticles to form designed patterns. The automated manipulation is based on a novel method, successive directional push. This method keeps pushing along a fixed forward direction until the particle reaches the baseline of the target position, and it then repeats the pushing process along the baseline direction. This process is iterated until the particle reaches its target position. By examining the topography of several local parallel scan lines, this method can determine the lateral coordinate of the particle. The novelty of this method {{lies in the fact that}} further pushing along the same pushing direction can be conducted without precise information about the forward position. The successive directional <b>push</b> <b>method</b> has been successfully implemented into an AFM system.

40|$|In this paper, Proactive Unified Spectrum Handoff (PUSH) {{scheme in}} {{cognitive}} radio mobile ad hoc networks (CR-MANETs) through an established route is considered {{in which the}} channel availability depends on the Primary User's (PU's) activity, secondary user's (SU's) mobility, and the channel heterogeneity. First, an analytical model for Unified Spectrum Handoff (USH) scheme is introduced in which the SUs will move to another unused spectrum band, giving priority to a PU. Then, the <b>PUSH</b> <b>method</b> is proposed in which a handoff threshold is used to initiate the handoff proactively. When a channel handoff cannot be performed due to the SU's mobility, a local flow handoff (LFH) is performed. The proposed PUSH algorithm uses the cognitive link availability prediction while considering the PU interference boundary to estimate the maximum link accessibility period. Based on the analytical model, the channel heterogeneity and the SU's mobility affected {{the performance of the}} handoff management method rather than the PU's activity.

40|$|Graph-based {{learning}} {{methods have}} a variety of names in-cluding semi-supervised and transductive learning. They typically use a diffusion to propagate labels from a small set of nodes with known class labels to the remaining nodes of the graph. While popular, these algorithms, when imple-mented in a straightforward fashion, are extremely sensitive to the details of the graph construction. Here, we provide four procedures to help make them more robust: recognizing implicit regularization in the diffusion, using a scalable <b>push</b> <b>method</b> to evaluate the diffusion, using rank-based rounding, and densifying the graph through a matrix polynomial. We study robustness with respect to the details of graph con-structions, errors in node labeling, degree variability, {{and a variety of other}} real-world heterogeneities, studying these methods through a precise relationship with mincut prob-lems. For instance, the densification strategy explicitly adds new weighted edges to a sparse graph. We find that this simple densification creates a graph where multiple diffusion methods are robust to several types of errors.

40|$|Abstract—In recent year, Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) {{approach}} for media streaming {{has been studied}} extensively. In comparison to on-demand media streaming, P 2 P live media streaming faces a much stringent time constraint. In order to improve the performance metrics, such as startup delay, source-to-end delay, and playback continuity, we present PALMS, a P 2 P {{approach for}} live media streaming where node employs gossip based pull and push protocols to receive and forward media data among connected nodes. We present a simple heuristic mechanism for the pull protocol {{in the selection of}} media segments and peers. Besides the pull method, a <b>push</b> <b>method</b> is deployed to increase the streaming quality. We also adopt a randomized push protocol in order to increase the probability of media data delivered to connected nodes. We know that the presence of freeriders could degrade the delivered streaming quality. In PALMS, a simple tit-for-tat incentive mechanism is adopted to discourage the existence of free-riders. We conducted simulations and performance comparisons for PALMS. Experimental results demonstrate that PALMS can deliver better streaming quality and more resilience towards the heterogeneity of network bandwidths as compared to some of the existing protocols...|$|E

40|$|Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are the {{extremely}} energetic deaths of massive stars. They {{play a vital}} role in the synthesis and dissemination of many heavy elements in the universe. In the past, CCSN nucleosynthesis calculations have relied on artificial explosion methods that do not adequately capture the physics of the innermost layers of the star. The <b>PUSH</b> <b>method,</b> calibrated against SN 1987 A, utilizes the energy of heavy-flavor neutrinos emitted by the proto-neutron star (PNS) to trigger parametrized explosions. This makes it possible to follow the consistent evolution of the PNS and to ensure a more accurate treatment of the electron fraction of the ejecta. Here, we present the Iron group nucleosynthesis results for core-collapse supernovae, exploded with PUSH, for two different progenitor series. Comparisons of the calculated yields to observational metal-poor star data are also presented. Nucleosynthesis yields will be calculated for all elements and over a wide range of progenitor masses.

40|$|Background: PEG {{tubes are}} {{inserted}} for long term enteral feeding and {{may need to}} be removed at some point post insertion. A recognized method to remove the PEG is the cut and <b>push</b> <b>method</b> (CP). Some studies have suggested that CP is safe whilst others have reported complications and death. Subsequently the use of CP is not uniform but, if safe, could provide a cost effective, minimally invasive, alternative to gastroscopy. The aim {{of this study was to}} locate and critically appraise all publications relevant to CP in adult patients using a systematic approach. Method: Systematic searching of electronic databases Embase, Medline and Cinahl, using keywords in title and abstracts. Exclusions were: non-human, under 18 years of age, English language. Time limits were not applied. Preliminary searching gave 538 hits that were then hand reviewed for relevance. Selected studies were critically appraised and data summarized into tables for use in the review. Results: 27 records were included in the review spanning from 1990 – 2014. A total of 21 case reports detailing complications in 24 individuals, including 5 deaths. There were 5 cohort studies and 1 case report detailing the safe use of CP, with 3 complications. Cases totalled 373 with 27 complications (7 %). Most common complication was gastrointestinal obstruction, usually occurring in the first 6 months post CP. A history of bowel surgery was evident in some cases where obstruction occurred. The majority of cohort studies reported the use of assessment criteria to exclude those at risk of obstruction and reported low complication rates. Conclusions: The quality and quantity of the evidence on CP is insufficient to make recommendations for clinical practice. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of CP. <br/...|$|E
