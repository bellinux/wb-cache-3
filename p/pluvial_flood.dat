The critical conditions considered for issue flood warnings were not only based on the water stage, but also on the extension of the flooded area. Further, a risk assessment framework for quantifying the reliability of the rainfall thresholds has been included; rainfall thresholds used in <b>pluvial</b> <b>flooding</b> warning should be influenced by the uncertainties in the rainfall characteristics (i. e. rainfall duration, depth and storm pattern). This risk assessment framework incorporates the correlated multivariate Monte Carlo simulation method, an hydraulic model for the simulation of rainfall excess propagation over surface urban drainage structures, i. e. streets and pathways. Thresholds rainfall are defined using a number of inundation criteria, to analyze the change in the rainfall threshold due to various definitions of inundation. Starting from estimated water stages and flooded area from inundation simulation rainfall thresholds can be obtained according a specific inundation criterion, including, together, a critical water depth and a critical flooding area. Finally, the second phase concerns the imminence of a possible hydrological risk by comparing the time when cumulative rainfall and rainfall thresholds meet to each other.

40|$|Introduction Flooding is {{a natural}} phenomenon, but human {{activity}} has significantly altered the natural drainage processes thereby occasionally causing greater flood risk. Urban flooding has become more frequent due {{to a number of}} factors including climate change, urban growth and an increase in paved surfaces. Pluvial flooding results from heavy rainfall when water that does not infiltrate into the ground ponds in hollows or flows over the ground. In flood damage estimation, the concept of damage curves or damage functions is applied. Such functions give the building damage due to inundation. Most damage assessment models have in common that the direct monetary damage is obtained from the type of the element at risk and the inundation depth.

40|$|Constructions of {{vulnerability}} are varied and contested through different research traditions, such {{that there is}} no agreed definition of its meaning. In an attempt to lessen this confusion, this thesis builds upon the distinction between etic (“outsider”) and emic (“insider”) orientated research and examines the extent to which vulnerability knowledge can be aligned to this spectrum. The nature of emic-orientated research necessitates the identification of “insiders”, who are assumed to be those ‘closest’ to the issue at hand and able to offer first-hand insights based on personal experience. However, it is arguably inappropriate to assume the existence of a supposedly homogeneous group of insiders, or a definitive boundary between insiders and outsiders. Therefore, this research critically examines the notion of “insiderness” {{and the extent to which}} this influences constructions of flood vulnerability. Mixed methods are employed to elicit the perspectives of emergency professionals and the public in two socially-contrasting locations exposed to multiple flood drivers; a Bradford town in West Yorkshire (fluvial and <b>pluvial</b> <b>flooding)</b> and a town on the Isle of Wight (tidal and <b>pluvial</b> <b>flooding).</b> Contents analysis, semi-structured interviews and cognitive interviews facilitated by a GIS-based flood risk mapping tool (“KEEPER”), demonstrate the influence of professional roles, scales of decision making and phase of emergency management upon constructions {{of vulnerability}}. From this, it is argued that area-wide vulnerability assessment could benefit from more interactive and malleable forms of mapping, flexible to different place and hazard contexts, and professional needs. With residents, questionnaires, in-depth interviews and vignettes reveal evidence of hazardcentric, social-centric and existential constructions, which inform self-declared vulnerabilities. A number of variables and processes are identified as relevant for understanding the formation of these constructions. For instance, this research documents the process of othering, whereby residents distance vulnerability from the self, onto a real or illusionary “vulnerable other”. Moreover, analysis suggests that this is partly motivated amongst “insiders” by the need to preserve ontological security. At a time where flooding is set to increase and households are expected to embrace responsibility and act to mitigate risks to their properties, these findings highlight a potentially significant barrier to household resilience, especially in the context of <b>pluvial</b> <b>flooding.</b> On the basis of this research, recommendations are made for using the concept of “insiderness” to target and tailor communication and community engagement in FRM...|$|R
40|$|It is {{a common}} {{practice}} to assign the return period of a given storm event to the urban <b>pluvial</b> <b>flood</b> event that such storm generates. However, this approach may be inappropriate as rainfall events with the same return period can produce different urban pluvial flooding events, i. e., with different associated flood extent, water levels and return periods. This depends {{on the characteristics of}} the rainfall events, such as spatial variability, and on other characteristics of the sewer system and the catchment. To address this, the paper presents an innovative contribution to produce stochastic urban <b>pluvial</b> <b>flood</b> hazard maps. A stochastic rainfall generator for urban-scale applications was employed to generate an ensemble of spatially—and temporally—variable design storms with similar return period. These were used as input to the urban drainage model of a pilot urban catchment (~ 9 km 2) located in London, UK. Stochastic flood hazard maps were generated through a frequency analysis of the flooding generated by the various storm events. The stochastic flood hazard maps obtained show that rainfall spatial-temporal variability {{is an important factor in}} the estimation of flood likelihood in urban areas. Moreover, as compared to the flood hazard maps obtained by using a single spatially-uniform storm event, the stochastic maps generated in this study provide a more comprehensive assessment of flood hazard which enables better informed flood risk management decisions. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Many {{urban areas}} {{experience}} both fluvial and pluvial floods, because locations next to rivers are preferred settlement {{areas and the}} predominantly sealed urban surface prevents infiltration and facilitates surface inundation. The latter problem is enhanced in cities with insufficient or non-existent sewer systems. While {{there are a number}} of approaches to analyse either a fluvial or <b>pluvial</b> <b>flood</b> hazard, studies of a combined fluvial and <b>pluvial</b> <b>flood</b> hazard are hardly available. Thus this study aims to analyse a fluvial and a <b>pluvial</b> <b>flood</b> hazard individually, but also to develop a method for the analysis of a combined pluvial and fluvial flood hazard. This combined fluvial–pluvial flood hazard analysis is performed taking Can Tho city, the largest city in the Vietnamese part of the Mekong Delta, as an example. In this tropical environment the annual monsoon triggered floods of the Mekong River, which can coincide with heavy local convective precipitation events, causing both fluvial and pluvial flooding at the same time. The fluvial flood hazard was estimated with a copula-based bivariate extreme value statistic for the gauge Kratie at the upper boundary of the Mekong Delta and a large-scale hydrodynamic model of the Mekong Delta. This provided the boundaries for 2 -dimensional hydrodynamic inundation simulation for Can Tho city. The pluvial hazard was estimated by a peak-over-threshold frequency estimation based on local rain gauge data and a stochastic rainstorm generator. Inundation for all flood scenarios was simulated by a 2 -dimensional hydrodynamic model implemented on a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) for time-efficient flood propagation modelling. The combined fluvial–pluvial flood scenarios were derived by adding rainstorms to the fluvial flood events during the highest fluvial water levels. The probabilities of occurrence of the combined events were determined assuming independence of the two flood types and taking the seasonality and probability of coincidence into account. All hazards – fluvial, pluvial and combined – were accompanied by an uncertainty estimation taking into account the natural variability of the flood events. This resulted in probabilistic flood hazard maps showing the maximum inundation depths for a selected set of probabilities of occurrence, with maps showing the expectation (median) and the uncertainty by percentile maps. The results are critically discussed and their usage in flood risk management are outlined...|$|E
40|$|<b>Pluvial</b> <b>flooding</b> is {{a problem}} in many cities and for city {{planning}} purpose the mechanisms behind <b>pluvial</b> <b>flooding</b> are of interest. Previous studies seldom use insurance claim data to analyse city scale characteristics that lead to flooding. In the present study, two long time series (∼ 20 years) of flood claims from property owners have been collected and analysed in detail to investigate the mechanisms and characteristics leading to urban flooding. The flood claim data come from the municipal water utility company and property owners with insurance that covers property loss from overland flooding, groundwater intrusion through basement walls and flooding from the drainage system. These data are used as a proxy for flood severity for several events in the Swedish city of Malmö. It is discussed which rainfall characteristics give most flooding and why some rainfall events do not lead to severe flooding, how city scale topography and sewerage system type influence spatial distribution of flood claims, and which impact high sea level has on flooding in Malmö. Three severe flood events are described in detail and compared with a number of smaller flood events. It was found that the main mechanisms and characteristics of flood extent and its spatial distribution in Malmö are intensity and spatial distribution of rainfall, distance to the main sewer system as well as overland flow paths, and type of drainage system, while high sea level has little impact on the flood extent. Finally, measures that could be taken to lower the flood risk in Malmö, and other cities with similar characteristics, are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Various studies {{indicate}} that the frequency and intensity of <b>pluvial</b> <b>flooding,</b> groundwater flooding, drought and heat stress will increase in The Netherlands. This {{is why it is}} important for Dutch municipalities to have a method for the assessment of vulnerability. However, vulnerability is not directly measurable. Methods to assess the vulnerability of urban areas to climate change are either qualitative and not informative enough or too costly, specific, or complex, and therefore they are not often applied by municipalities. The Adaptation Tipping Point (ATP) method is a promising method that helps municipalities to determine the urgency of climate change adaptation. It comprises assessment of ATPs: “the point where the magnitude of climate change is such that the current management strategy will no longer meet the objectives” (Kwadijk et al., 2010, p. 730). In this thesis, the ATP-method is pre-tested as a method for vulnerability assessment in Rotterdam-Noord and a part of Nijmegen. These case studies, together with past experiences based on literature research, suggest that the method is - in principle - suitable for use as a way of assessing vulnerability by municipalities. It provides useful information in addition to traditional top-down impact and damage assessments. However, more research into improving the feasibility of the ATP-method, for example through estimation of ATPs on the basis of either rules of thumb or expert judgement, is necessary to make the method practically feasible. In addition, the application of the method to the theme of <b>pluvial</b> <b>flooding</b> is a proof of principle; it needs to be applied to the themes of groundwater flooding, drought and heat stress on municipal level as well.

The concurrence of <b>pluvial</b> and fluvial <b>flooding</b> can aggravate their (individual) potential damages. To analyse the impact caused by individual and composite type of flooding, the SIPSON/UIM model, an integrated 1 D sewer and 2 D overland flow was applied to numerical modelling. An event matrix of possible pluvial scenarios was combined with hypothetic overtopping and breaching situations to estimate the surface flooding consequences in the Stockbridge area, Keighley (Bradford, UK). The modelling results identified different flooding drivers {{in different parts of the}} study area and showed that the worst scenarios resulted from synthesised events.
