5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{for the single}} was directed by Wataru Takeishi, and uses a shorten version of Peters' remix. The visual portrays Hamasaki in a dark laboratory, being surrounded by keyboards, electronic devices and a black bird. Throughout the music video, several <b>people</b> <b>start</b> to wear headphones and follow Hamasaki, with them eventually starting {{to listen to the}} song and observing TV monitors of the singer. Each person, including Hamasaki, wears black eye shadow on one eye, and a code on their hand. Over the clip, the singer is seen singing to the recording in the laboratory, with interspersed scenes portraying her wearing the outfit used for the single's artwork. The music video was included on several DVD compilations released by Hamasaki, includingA Clips (2000), A Complete Box Set (2004), and the digital release of A Clips Complete (2014).|$|E
5|$|Many <b>people</b> <b>start</b> {{to show up}} at the Quahog's Men's Club and Lois and {{her friends}} start to get annoyed. In order to get back at them, they enter the club. Everyone dances, except for Bonnie, because her husband is handicapped. Joe feels {{self-conscious}} about his disability, and decides to get surgery so that {{he will be able to}} walk again. When Joe comes out of the operation, he invites his friends to go do physical activities such as rock climbing, karate, and dance. Joe starts to not care about his friends and his wife, and finds three new jock friends that share his status. Lois and Peter are worried about Joe, and Lois suggests that Peter should find a new friend to replace him. Meanwhile, Joe realizes that he has outgrown Bonnie and leaves her. Desperate to get their friend back, Peter, Cleveland and Quagmire try to re-cripple Joe, failing miserably until Bonnie comes along with Joe's handgun and shoots (and misses) Joe's spine. Sick of waiting in pain, Joe takes the gun and shoots himself in the spine, re-crippling himself. They all then go to the Drunken Clam where Joe apologizes to Peter, Cleveland and Quagmire for how he acted and they all forgive him.|$|E

5|$|While rain {{starts to}} fall, and <b>people</b> <b>start</b> {{to clear the}} streets, Carey remains walking on the pathway. The girl now reaches her destination, and is welcomed into the home of her lover. They soon board a bus, and travel to a new home where they will live together. As {{they are about to}} enter the bus, the girl's mother is seen {{screaming}} in tears for her daughter to return to her. She hesitates, and then continues with her lover onto the transport. The scene once again focuses on Carey, who is standing {{in the midst of a}} torrential downpour, singing to the heavens. As she reaches the song's climax, Carey, now dry and dressed in a long black gown, is shown singing at the altar of a church. As she sings at the church, scenes of the girl lighting a candle, and her lover laying together with her on a bed are shown, before focusing back on Carey. She stares at an elderly couple in the first row at the church, an inter-racial couple now revealed to be her parents, and smiles while wearing her mother's charmbracelet. The elderly woman begins crying, as her husband holds her hand as they intently stare at Carey. Their faces rejuvenate to show them as a young couple, as their photo is taken and placed into the family album from the beginning of the video.|$|E
25|$|Many {{philosophers}} {{throughout history}} had, arguably, {{been tempted to}} reduce two {{of these kinds of}} belief and knowledge to the other one: René Descartes and David Hume thought that the only knowledge that <b>people</b> <b>start</b> with is self-knowledge. Some logical positivists (and some would say Wittgenstein, or Wilfrid Sellars) held that <b>people</b> <b>start</b> with beliefs only about the external world. (Arguably, Friedrich Schelling and Emmanuel Levinas held that <b>people</b> <b>start</b> with beliefs only about other people.) It is not possible, on Davidson's view, for a person to have only one of the three kinds of mental content; anyone who has beliefs of one of the kinds must have beliefs of the other two kinds.|$|E

Experience of the underwater environment varies depending on where the diver has access to suitable sites - there is more to see on a coastal reef than in most freshwater lakes.|$|E

25|$|In recent years, many <b>people</b> <b>start</b> the {{fireworks}} already on New Year's Eve or even many days before.

25|$|Huckabee has voiced {{his support}} for self-defense and the Castle Doctrine, and has {{generally}} taken an anti-gun control stance. He believes that the concealed carrying of weapons should be allowed. He has said that whenever he hears <b>people</b> <b>start</b> talking about hunting when referring to the Second Amendment, he realizes {{they do not know}} what they are talking about, because the Second Amendment was to allow an armed citizenry the opportunity to protect themselves in case a tyrannical government ever came into power.|$|E
25|$|A general {{economic}} {{idea is that}} if {{sales taxes}} are high enough, <b>people</b> <b>start</b> engaging in widespread tax evading activity (like buying over the Internet, {{pretending to be a}} business, buying at wholesale, buying products through an employer etc.). On the other hand, total VAT rates can rise above 10% without widespread evasion because of the novel collection mechanism. However, because of its particular mechanism of collection, VAT becomes quite easily the target of specific frauds like carousel fraud, which can be very expensive in terms of loss of tax incomes for states.|$|E

25|$|Consistent {{with the}} {{conservation}} hypothesis, people can exert self-control despite ego depletion if {{the stakes are}} high enough. Offering cash incentives or other motives for good performance counteracts the effects of ego depletion. This may seem surprising but in fact it may be highly adaptive. Given the value and importance of the capacity for self-control, it would be dangerous for a person to lose that capacity completely, and so ego depletion effects may occur because <b>people</b> <b>start</b> conserving their remaining strength. When people do exert themselves on the second task, they deplete the resource even more, as reflected in severe impairments on a third task that they have not anticipated.|$|E
25|$|One {{explanation}} is that social-media users usually split their time between Facebook and interacting in the real world. When something entertaining happens in real life, people {{feel the need to}} share it. It might seem harmless, however at some point people begin to substitute one reality with another. As a result, <b>people</b> <b>start</b> to change their behavior and even their assumptions about life, love and friendships, based on the Facebook reality. This leads to cognitive dissonance. Such a discrepancy between perceptions and beliefs can damage people's emotional balance and lead them to experience identity confusion, relationship conflicts, changes in judgement, and even psychotic break.|$|E
25|$|At twelve noon work in {{the parish}} comes to a {{standstill}} and <b>people</b> <b>start</b> {{to make their way}} to Haxey village to gather and take part in the traditional ritual. At about 12:30 the officials start a tour of the ale houses involved, and drink free drinks at each pub, provided by the landlord as a token of good luck to try the bring the Hood its way. Many people follow this tour and consider it {{a vital part of the}} day. They start at the Carpenters Arms where they sing the traditional folk songs and ceremoniously paint the Fool's face. Then they move to the Kings Arms and then up towards the church taking in the Loco and the Duke William on the way, drinking and singing as they go. Around 2:30pm the officials leave the Duke and process up to the church.|$|E

25|$|In Hong Kong and Macau, the {{day after}} the Mid-Autumn Festival is a public holiday rather than the festival date itself (unless that date falls on a Sunday, then Monday is also a holiday), because many celebration events are held at night. There are a number of festive {{activities}} such as lighting lanterns, but mooncakes are the most important feature there. However, people don't usually buy mooncakes for themselves, but to give their relatives as presents. <b>People</b> <b>start</b> to exchange these presents well in advance of the festival. Hence, mooncakes are sold in elegant boxes for presentation purpose. Also, the price for these boxes are not considered cheap—a four-mooncake box of the lotus seeds paste with egg yolks variety, can generally cost US$40 or more. However, as environmental protection has become a concern of the public in recent years, many mooncake manufacturers in Hong Kong have adopted practices to reduce packaging materials to practical limits. The mooncake manufacturers also explore in the creation of new types of mooncakes, such as ice-cream mooncake and snow skin mooncake.|$|E

The raas-garba is a folk dance done as a celebration of Navratri by Gujarati people. The folk costume of this dance is chaniya choli for women and kedia for men. Different styles and steps of garba include dodhiyu, simple five, simple seven, popatiyu, trikoniya (hand movement which forms an imagery triangle), lehree, tran taali, butterfly, hudo, two claps and many more Sheri garba {{is one of the}} oldest form of garba where all the ladies wear red patola sari and sing along while dancing.It is a very graceful form of garba.

Undhiyu, a special dish made of various vegetables, is a must-have of Gujarati people on Makar Sankranti. Surat is especially well known for the strong string which is made by applying glass powder on the row thread to provide it a cutting edge.|$|E
