The disintegration efficiencies of these methods under the optimized conditions were in the following descending order: 37. 8 % for sono-oxidative pre-treatment > 26. 3 % for sonication > 13. 1 % for K 2 FeO 4 oxidation. The influences of these methods on anaerobic biodegradability were tested with the biochemical methane potential assay. It was seen that the cumulative methane production increased by 9. 2 % in the K 2 FeO 4 oxidation reactor, 15. 8 % in the sonicated reactor and 18. 6 % in the reactor with sono-oxidative pre-treatment, compared to the control (untreated) reactor...|$|E
40|$|The aqueous {{reactivity}} of five prominent endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) with <b>potassium</b> <b>ferrate</b> has been studied. The degradation kinetics and reaction pathways for bisphenol A (BPA) {{have been considered}} in detail, and the reaction rate constants for 17 α-ethynylestradiol (EE 2), estrone (E 1), β-estradiol (E 2), and estriol (E 3) have been determined, from tests {{carried out in the}} pH range of 8 - 12 and at different reactant molar ratios. The rate constants were determined by a kinetic model incorporating the various species equilibria for the EDC compounds and ferrate, using observations of the temporal reduction in EDC and ferrate concentrations. In agreement with other studies the oxidation of the EDCs was found to be greater for mono-protonated ferrate, 4 HFeO, than for non-protonated ferrate, 2 4 FeO. Among the five EDCs, which all have phenol moieties, the ferrate oxidation of the four steroid estrogens (each incorporating the cyclopentanoperhydrophenanthrene ring) had higher reaction rates than BPA. The by-products of BPA degradation by ferrate were analyzed by LC/MS-MS and GC/MS-MS and nine specific compounds were identified, including p-isopropylphenol, 4 -isopropanolphenol, p-isopropenylphenol, and some dicarboxylic acids etc. It is concluded that ferrate oxidation could be an effective treatment method for the purification of waters containing these particular EDCs...|$|E
40|$|The {{photocatalytic}} {{degradation of}} sulfonamides in aqueous TiO 2 suspension under UV irradiation {{has been investigated}} using <b>potassium</b> <b>ferrate</b> as electron acceptors. The {{results showed that the}} stability of Fe(VI) is dependent on pH significantly, and the stability reduces obviously in the presence of UV-TiO 2. The experiments indicated that Fe(VI) could effectively scavenge the conduction band electrons from the surface of TiO 2. The photocatalytic oxidation of sulfonamides with Fe(VI) was found to be much faster than that without Fe(VI). The SD, SM, and SMX concentration was greatly reduced by 89. 2 %, 83. 4 %, and 82. 0 %, respectively, after 10 [*]min with UV-TiO 2 -Fe(VI), comparing to 65. 2 %, 66. 0 %, and 71. 9 %, respectively, with Fe(VI) only in the dark and 71. 3 %, 72. 7 %, and 76. 0 %, respectively, with UV-TiO 2. The pH value of solution significantly influenced the sulfonamides degradation in UV-TiO 2 -Fe(VI) system. The degradation amount of sulfonamides after 10 [*]min was a maximum at pH 7. The intermediate products of sulfonamides oxidation by UV-TiO 2 -Fe(VI) were analysed by LC-HESI-MS-MS and the results suggested that a majority of sulfonamides turned into large-molecule products without complete mineralization...|$|E
40|$|International audienceEnergy {{intensive}} classical metallurgical processes, {{the depletion}} of high-grade ores and primary sources push the scientific and technical communities to treat lean and complex ores as well as secondary metal resources for the recovery of valuable metals. Chlorination technique could be a suitable technology for this purpose. This paper Summarizes laboratory experimentation of chlorination processes developed for the extraction of tantalum and niobium from their bearing materials, the upgrading of chromite, the treatment of sulfide concentrates, and the decontamination of jarosite, {{as well as for}} the synthesis of <b>potassium</b> <b>ferrate.</b> Each investigation started by a thermodynamic study of different systems (M-O-Cl, M-S-Cl, M = metal) including the calculations of the standard free energy of chlorination reactions and phase stability diagrams of these systems. The kinetics of these chlorination reactions was studied by thermogravimetric analysis. The effects of total gas flow rate, temperature, individual reactant partial pressures, etc., on the chlorination reaction rate were investigated. Besides, experiments were also conducted in tubular furnaces. Several different qualitative and quantitative analyses methods were used to evaluate the selectivity and performance of the chlorination processes. The results reported in this paper show the advantages of the chlorination technology in terms of energy saving. selectivity of the processes,and recovery rate of valuable metals. They also demonstrate the possibility to treat lean raw materials, to improve the decontamination of wastes, to generate environmentally safer residues, to engineer new compounds, etc...|$|E
40|$|An {{interdisciplinary}} team {{of students}} from New Mexico State University has developed a solution to Task I of the 1998 WERC Environmental Design Contest. The proposed process addresses the treatment of mine tailings which generate acid and the recovery of metals contained in the tailings. The objective of the design is to recover and transport the mine tailings in a slurry; recover {{as much of the}} valuable metals as feasible; treat the tailings to a pH of 7. 0 - 9. 0; and design a system to recover the water from the slurry for reuse in the transport and treatment system. In the proposed process, mine tailings are treated to oxidize the sulfides present and to solubilize and recover the copper present in the tailings. <b>Potassium</b> <b>ferrate</b> (K 2 FeO 4) is used to oxidize the sulfides. The oxidation of the sulfides is important because it stops acid generation from occurring in the tailings and because 45 % of the copper present {{is in the form of}} sulfides. The tailings are then treated with sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4) to solubilize all of the copper hydroxides produced. The copper is extracted using solvent extraction and the remaining tailings are treated to a pH of 7. 0 - 9. 0 and then deposited in an impoundment. The total capital investment for the project was estimated to be approximately $ 1, 800, 000 and the operating costs estimated to be $ 6, 000, 000 /yr. The total project cost is $ 8, 000, 000. The following pages contain the technical details of the process, the economic details of the project, regulatory issues, and an extensive community relations plan for implementation of the project...|$|E
40|$|The bifunctional enzyme ribulosebisphosphate (RuBP) carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco; EC 4. 1. 1. 39) {{provides}} a common link between photosynthetic CO(, 2) fixation and photorespiration in higher plants. In {{spite of its}} abundance and physiological importance, relatively little is known concerning the essential amino acids and localization of large subunit binding domains involved in the catalytic functions and metabolite regulation of this key photosynthetic enzyme. ^ Diethylpyrocarbonate (DEP) inactivation of Rubisco at pH 6. 0 exhibited rate saturation, a second order rate constant of 2. 5 M(2 ̆ 7 - 1) s(2 ̆ 7 - 1) and a reaction order of 0. 92. Excellent protection against inactivation was afforded by the phosphorylated substrate RuBP and the competitive inhibitors sedoheptulosebisphosphate and inorganic phosphate. The formation of ethoxyformyl histidine residues was accompanied {{by an increase in}} absorbance at 239 nm ((DELTA) A(, 239)). Verification that all of the Rubisco amino acid residues modified by DEP at pH 6. 0 were histidine was accomplished by simultaneous determination of (DELTA) A(, 239) and (2 ̆ 714) CDEP-incorporation. We have demonstrated the presence of a single histidyl residue per 69 -kilodalton enzyme protomer which appears to be essential for activity and resides in the large catalytic subunit by modification with DEP at pH 6. 0. This histidyl residue may, indeed, function as the base required to create the carbanion at C- 2 of RuBP in the proposed carboxylase reaction mechanism. Chemical modification by rose bengal, methylene blue, pyridoxal 52 ̆ 7 -phosphate, <b>potassium</b> <b>ferrate,</b> cyanate and periodate were attempted, but problems with each experimental system allowed no definitive conclusions to be drawn regarding essential groups for catalysis or effector modulation in Rubisco. ^ Characterization of homogeneous Rubisco isolated from diploid and tetraploid cultivars of perennial ryegrass reportedly differing in photorespiration revealed virtually identical K(,m) (CO(, 2)) values for fully CO(, 2) /Mg(2 ̆ 72 +) -activated enzyme and CO(, 2) /Mg(2 ̆ 72 +) -activation and deactivation kinetics. The doubling of ploidy also had no effect on the quantity of total soluble protein or Rubisco protein in young, fully expanded ryegrass leaves. ^ Hydroxylamine, a reported differential modulator of Rubisco, was found to inhibit both the carboxylase and oxygenase activities when assayed separately or simultaneously. Two inhibitory processes were observed: a slow reaction of hydroxylamine with RuBP and a rapid, direct inhibition of the enzyme. ...|$|E
