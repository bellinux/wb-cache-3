5|$|In the 1860s, James Clerk Maxwell, William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) {{and others}} {{working under the}} auspices of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, built on Gauss' work and formalised the concept of a {{coherent}} system of units with base units and derived units. The principle of coherence was successfully used to define a number of units of measure based on the centimetre–gram–second system of units (CGS), including the erg for energy, the dyne for force, the barye for pressure, the <b>poise</b> for dynamic viscosity and the stokes for kinematic viscosity.|$|E

At the Canucks' 2008 SuperSkills event, he beat the team's reigning hardest shooter, Sami Salo, with a 99.3 mile-per-hour shot and has gone on to win the competition in 2009 and 2010, as well. He is also known for his <b>poise</b> and confidence with the puck, allowing him to make strong first passes out of the defensive zone to forwards. Many within the Canucks organization, such as Assistant Coach Rick Bowness, have asserted this as a reflection of his calm off-ice demeanor.|$|E
5|$|Grant {{continued}} his coaching {{success in the}} NFL as he took over from original coach, Norm Van Brocklin. Over his tenure as Vikings head coach, Grant was known for instilling discipline in his teams and displaying a lack of emotion during games. He believed that football is a game of controlled emotion and teams would not follow the coach's lead {{if he were to}} panic or lose his <b>poise</b> {{during the course of a}} game. He required his team to stand at attention in a straight line during the entire national anthem played before the game and even had national anthem practice. Grant required outdoor practice during the winter to get players used to the cold weather and would not allow heaters on the sidelines during games.|$|E
40|$|The {{developmental}} transitions occurring during embryogenesis involve {{spatial and}} temporal changes in gene expression patterns, which are largely dependent {{on a group of}} regulatory elements known as enhancers. Enhancers are short DNA sequences able to positively control the expression of their target genes in a distance and orientation independent manner. Previous studies uncovered a unique set of enhancers in pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs), named “Poised Enhancers”. <b>Poised</b> enhancers are marked by repressive histone marks, like the trimethylation of histone three lysine 27, which is deposited by Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC 2), and also are bound by co-activators like P 300. The fact that <b>poised</b> enhancers display both activating and repressing features as well as evidences indicating that they are associated with genes involved in early organogenesis led us to suggest that these regulatory elements are already bookmarked in ESCs and thus primed for their future activation once the differentiation process starts. However, the functional relevance of <b>poised</b> enhancers and the role of their unique chromatin features remain unknown. To gain insights into these major questions, first, <b>poised</b> enhancers were identified in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and their activation was evaluated during the establishment of anterior neural identity. Second, using CRISPR/Cas 9 technology, <b>poised</b> enhancer candidates were deleted in mESCs, which were then differentiated into anterior neural progenitors. In general, the <b>poised</b> enhancer deletions resulted in severely reduced induction of the <b>poised</b> enhancer’s target genes. Furthermore, circularized chromosome conformation capture coupled to sequencing experiments revealed that <b>poised</b> enhancers and their target genes physically interacted already in ESCs, thus preceding the activation of <b>poised</b> enhancers and their target genes. Interestingly, these <b>poised</b> enhancer-target gene interactions observed in mESCs were found to be PRC 2 dependent. Additionally, it was demonstrated that while PRC 2 was not necessary to maintain <b>poised</b> enhancers in an inactive state in mESCs, was required for the induction of the <b>poised</b> enhancers’ target genes upon anterior neural differentiation. Finally, <b>poised</b> enhancers were found to frequently reside within a high CpG-dinucleotide genomic context that can directly mediate the recruitment of PRC 2. Overall, these findings demonstrate that <b>poised</b> enhancers are essential for the proper expression of the anterior neural developmental program. Importantly, our work illuminates an unexpected function for PRC 2 in promoting neural induction. Our data demonstrates that both <b>poised</b> enhancers and their target genes display intrinsic sequence features that can directly mediate PRC 2 recruitment. Consequently, PRC 2 can bring <b>poised</b> enhancers and their targets into physical proximity already in mESCs, thus providing a permissive regulatory topology that we propose can facilitate the future induction of mayor anterior neural genes. ...|$|R

40|$|Polycomb {{repression}} in mouse {{embryonic stem}} cells (ESCs) is tightly associated with promoter co-occupancy of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) which is thought to prime genes for activation during early development. However, it is unknown whether RNAPII <b>poising</b> is a general feature of Polycomb repression, or is lost during differentiation. Here, we map the genome-wide occupancy of RNAPII and Polycomb from pluripotent ESCs to non-dividing functional dopaminergic neurons. We find that <b>poised</b> RNAPII complexes are ubiquitously present at Polycomb-repressed genes at all stages of neuronal differentiation. We observe both loss and acquisition of RNAPII and Polycomb at specific groups of genes reflecting their silencing or activation. Strikingly, RNAPII remains <b>poised</b> at transcription factor genes which are silenced in neurons through Polycomb repression, and have major roles in specifying other, non-neuronal lineages. We conclude that RNAPII <b>poising</b> is intrinsically associated with Polycomb repression throughout differentiation. Our work suggests that the tight interplay between RNAPII <b>poising</b> and Polycomb repression not only instructs promoter state transitions, but also may enable promoter plasticity in differentiated cells...|$|R

40|$|<b>Poised</b> (bivalent) {{chromatin}} {{is defined}} by the simultaneous presence of histone modifications associated with both gene activation and repression. This epigenetic feature was first observed at promoters of lineage-specific regulatory genes in embryonic stem cells in culture. More recent work has shown that, in vivo, mammalian germ cells maintain <b>poised</b> chromatin at promoters of many genes that regulate somatic development, and that they retain this state from fetal stages through meiosis and gametogenesis. We hypothesize that the <b>poised</b> chromatin state is essential for germ cell identity and function. We propose three roles for <b>poised</b> chromatin in the mammalian germ line: prevention of DNA methylation, maintenance of germ cell identity and preparation for totipotency. We discuss these roles in the context of recently proposed models for germline potency and epigenetic inheritance. Howard Hughes Medical InstituteNational Institutes of Health (U. S. ...|$|R

40|$|Changes in gene {{regulation}} frequently underlie changes in morphology during evolution, {{and differences in}} chromatin state have been linked with changes in anatomical structure and gene expression across evolutionary time.

We examined the <b>poised</b> (H 3 K 4 me 3 /H 3 K 27 me 3 bivalent) epigenetic state in male germ cells from five mammalian and one avian species. We find that core genes <b>poised</b> in germ cells from multiple amniote species are ancient regulators of morphogenesis that sit {{at the top of}} transcriptional hierarchies controlling somatic tissue development, whereas genes that gain <b>poising</b> in germ cells from individual species act downstream of core <b>poised</b> genes during development in a species-specific fashion.
