Services delivered by the local government include pre-school, kindergarten, and vocational schools, health <b>protection,</b> <b>housing</b> regulation, some road services, refuse collection, cemeteries, some environmental and consumer protection services, and economic promotion activities. Other services are provided to the city by the central government.

There is also a specific Port Police, composed of the Harbour Police and Bulk Sugar Terminal Police.

Methods: Data collected in the European ENABLE-AGE study were used to identify people with self-reported Parkinson&# 39;s disease (n = 20) and to select three matched controls per individual (n = 60). The matching criteria were age (mean = 82 years), sex, country, and type of housing. Analyses targeted use and perceived unmet need of technical aids and housing adaptations. Results: Very old people with self-reported Parkinson&# 39;s disease use significantly more aids for personal mobility than very old people in general. They have, furthermore, a significant increased unmet need concerning aids for personal care and <b>protection.</b> <b>Housing</b> adaptations did not differ between the two groups. Conclusion: Since people with Parkinson&# 39;s disease use technical aids to a higher extent and express an unmet need, they may require more thorough counseling regarding technical aids. Thus, this explorative study provides important information for health care professionals, rehabilitation, and future research. Moreover, {{in order to develop}} knowledge about specific challenges connected to Parkinson&# 39;s disease among the very old, further and larger studies targeting environmental resources are needed. Such studies should preferably include people with a verified diagnosis. Keywords: technical aids, environment, rehabilitation, activities of daily lif...|$|E
40|$|Underemployment {{is defined}} as working less than 35 hours in a given week and preferring to work more paid hours. In Australia, {{underemployment}} is well above the OECD average (OECD Employment Outlook 2010), is more widespread than unemployment and is prevalent amongst women, the young and unskilled. Most experiences of underemployment are temporary, but up {{to a third of}} people are still underemployed a year later. Jobs associated with underemployment tend to be low income, but also intermittent and casual with volatile earnings. This project sought to see what impact this might have on housing security as measured by housing payment arrears or housing payment risk (i. e. whether the household is paying more than a threshold amount in housing costs). The study used ABS labour force statistics and the Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey. Underemployed persons living in single-earner households tend to be lone persons or lone parents concentrated in the private rental market, while those in multiple-earner households tend to be couples and home-purchasers. Underemployment is significantly linked with the risk of housing payment arrears and housing payment risk, but this is especially the case for those in single earner households (and for young tenants in particular). Renters are more likely than mortgage holders to face long-term problems with housing insecurity because of underemployment—possibly because mortgage holders are more likely to extend forbearance than rental investors. The presence of other earners in a household cushions but does not reverse housing insecurity for underemployed households. For this reason, policy interventions or assistance are most appropriately targeted at households where underemployment is severe, sustained or recurrent—especially single earner households. Policy interventions could be at the labour market end, such as improved minimum employment standards for casual and contract workers and welfare reforms to increase personal income <b>protection.</b> <b>Housing</b> market interventions might include changes to Commonwealth Rent Assistance to widen eligibility to those presently employed but earning low or intermittent amounts, and other programs to improve security of tenure for underemployed households...|$|E

Aside from the danger that soldiers have to face every day, they are challenged by the harsh desert climate conditions, which greatly affect their quality of life.

Biomimicry, a new discipline that studies nature’s best biological ideas and then imitates these forms, processes, systems, and strategies to solve human problems, is the recommended approach to sustainable design. The purpose of this project is to develop a design model that offers comfort and protection for troop shelters based on biomimetic principles. The final design proposal is a synthesis of three important aspects of the research: the recognition of global warming challenges, the confinement of military standards, and the interpretation of nine biomimetic design principles extracted from the study of desert plants and animals. A detailed outline of the biomimetic design principles along with a clear understanding of the different phases of contingency construction formalized the initial context of the new war shelter. The final design example is a burrowed and bermed living space that is sheltered by a modular panelized roof and wall system. Through a combination of building and model simulation and a comprehensive comparative analysis that factors in every numerous variables of design, one can conclude that a low greenhouse gas emission design model for troop shelters that provides comfort and protection can be achieved by using biomimetic principles.

40|$|Landscape is {{a complex}} system of {{competitive}} spatial functions. This competition is especially readable in high dense urban areas between housing, industry, leisure facilities, transport and infrastructure, energy supply, flood protection, natural resources. Nevertheless, those conflicts are seldom discussed and worked out in a complex and interdisciplinary way. Additional to that, ecological interests and matters are very often handled as a compensation for constructional intervention into the landscape. That leads to separate solutions concerning to the main task. In this sense there are no landscape concepts to see such tasks as a multidimensional question to combine infrastructure or housing with ecology and (landscape) design to get more positive effects in a wider sense for urban areas. It is also a question to create an ecological network with an aesthetical dimension. We want to explain some examples from the Netherlands which show how complex spatial conflicts under the synonym of green infrastructure can discuss and work out in an interdisciplinary way and lead to long-term solutions in rural and urban areas. Whereas in Germany (but not only there), people regard nature and ecology as an antithesis to urban or economic development, in the Netherlands the development of nature has become an element which unites economic, ecological and security-related ({{in the case of}} flood) interests. This is seen particularly clearly in the case of flood protection. A technocratic flood protection policy, which reacted to a flood, was replaced by an active preventative policy, connected to and determined by the causes, and including a diverse group of participants and disciplines. The search for suitable solutions was no longer related only to the medium „river“, but awakened the awareness for the landscape as a whole and the totality of its formative functions. The examples combine solutions in the field of flood <b>protection,</b> <b>housing</b> and infrastructure with the development of green infrastructures (city development Arnhem – flood protection, nature development and ecological design; Grensmaas – Restoration of a river by linking ecology and economy; Brainport Eindhoven – development of a high tech campus with an integrated natural and flood protection planning; Zuidplaspolder – housing on one of the deepest points in the landscape of the Netherlands). We would like to give a pleading for the necessity of interdisciplinary work to find out solutions for complex spatial questions. We want to make clear, that tasks in the field of housing, infrastructure, energy and so on do not only ask for one mono-functional solution, but linked to other disciplines like ecology and landscape planning and finally to aesthetical, social and environmental tasks...|$|E
