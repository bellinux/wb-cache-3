5|$|A {{number of}} {{organizations}} exist that promote {{the acceptance of}} obesity. They have increased in <b>prominence</b> <b>in</b> {{the latter half of}} the 20thcentury. The US-based National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance (NAAFA) was formed in 1969 and describes itself as a civil rights organization dedicated to ending size discrimination.|$|E
5|$|A variant {{from the}} Gibson area has an upright habit and leaves. Otherwise, Banksia speciosa shows little {{variation}} across its range.

40|$|Long-exposure spectro-polarimetry in the {{near-infrared}} is {{a preferred}} method {{to measure the}} magnetic field and other physical properties of solar <b>prominences.</b> <b>In</b> the past, {{it has been very}} difficult to observe <b>prominences</b> <b>in</b> this way with sufficient spatial resolution to fully understand their dynamical properties. Solar prominences contain highly transient structures, visible only at small spatial scales; hence they must be observed at sub-arcsecond resolution, with a high temporal cadence. An adaptive optics (AO) system capable of directly locking-on to prominence structure away from the solar limb has the potential to allow for diffraction-limited spectro-polarimetry of solar <b>prominences.</b> <b>In</b> this paper, the performance of the off-limb AO system and its expected performance, at the desired science wavelength 8542 A, are shown...|$|R

5|$|Marsh also gained <b>prominence</b> <b>in</b> the inner-southern Sydney {{suburb of}} La Perouse, {{which had a}} large Indigenous population, by demonstrating his boomerang skills.

40|$|The dynamic {{formation}} of <b>prominences</b> <b>in</b> the initial magnetothermal equilibrium and their stability to sideward displacements are investigated {{focusing on the}} structure of the 2 D solar atmosphere in the presence of coronal arcades or loops. A model based on 2 D magnetohydrodynamic equations takes into account gravity, compressible flows, heating, radiation, anisotropic thermal conduction, and coupling to a deep chromosphere. It is found that <b>prominences</b> <b>in</b> simple arcades characterized by magnetic field with significant curvature at the apex are unstable to a lateral displacement...|$|R

40|$|There {{are several}} {{theories}} regarding what influences <b>prominence</b> assignment <b>in</b> English noun-noun compounds. We developed corpus-driven models for automatically predicting <b>prominence</b> assignment <b>in</b> noun-noun compounds using feature sets {{based on two}} such theories: the informativeness theory and the semantic composition theory. The evaluation of the prediction models indicate that though both of these theories are relevant, they account for different types of variability <b>in</b> <b>prominence</b> assignment. ...|$|R
5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{long-term}} {{consequence of the}} battle was {{the death of the}} tourmarches Diogenes: by virtue of his unusual <b>prominence</b> <b>in</b> Theophanes's account, Henri Grégoire identified this Diogenes with the original archetype for the later epic hero Digenes Akritas.|$|E
5|$|Sauvignon blanc is also {{beginning}} to gain <b>prominence</b> <b>in</b> areas like South Africa's Stellenbosch and Durbanville and Italy's Collio Goriziano areas. It {{is also one}} of the main ingredients in Muffato della Sala, one of Italy's most celebrated sweet wines.|$|E
5|$|Several critics however, {{were more}} {{enthusiastic}} about the film. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave Hoodwinked! an A- and praised the zaniness of its humor. Calling the filmmakers heroes, he compared them to Quentin Tarantino and Steven Soderbergh due to their potential for bringing independent filmmaking to <b>prominence</b> <b>in</b> animation.|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which solar prominences are filled with plasma are still undetermined. In this study we perform a quantitative analysis of the thermal properties of moving features <b>in</b> <b>prominences</b> <b>in</b> order to put constraints on models of prominence formation and dynamics. In order to make such measurements of quickly moving features seen <b>in</b> <b>prominences</b> <b>in</b> the UV we use the SOHO instruments SUMER and CDS to take a time series of exposures at a single pointing position, providing a measurement of spectral line properties {{as a function of}} time and position along the slit. The resulting observations in spectral lines in a range of 'transition region' temperatures allow us to analyze the thermal properties of the moving prominence sources as a function of time...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the roles of}} <b>prominences</b> <b>in</b> the solar scheme. Attention is given to classifications and the ways <b>in</b> which <b>prominences</b> exist: hydrostatic support, ballistic support, and magnetic support. In the case of ballistic support, surges are differentiated from sprays which involve the ejection of material that is already above the solar surface. Discussion also covers filimets and fibrils and the conditions for their appearance. It is proposed that most flares originate <b>in</b> <b>prominence</b> instabilities. <b>In</b> addition supergranulation is covered, noting the network is not seen on the boundary of unipolar regions. It is concluded that prominences {{play a critical role}} in flares and field reconnection, and the evolution of solar magnetic fields...|$|R

5|$|The Beatles' rise to <b>prominence</b> <b>in</b> the United States in February 1964 was a {{significant}} development {{in the history of}} the band's commercial success. In addition to establishing the Beatles' international stature, it changed attitudes to popular music in the United States, whose own Memphis-driven musical evolution had made it a global trend-setter.|$|E
5|$|The strip {{appeared}} in Help! and Cavalier magazines. It subsequently gained <b>prominence</b> <b>in</b> publications {{associated with the}} underground comix scene between 1965 and 1972.

5|$|A {{native of}} {{what would become the}} {{province}} of Ontario, May moved to Manitoba soon after completing education in his hometown. In Manitoba, he would take to briefly farming, before entering into the construction industry, which he would establish <b>prominence</b> <b>in.</b> After doing work for the railway, he would move to Winnipeg where he would join a contracting firm and become involved in the construction of many buildings. After moving west and living briefly in Carberry, Manitoba, May came to Edmonton in 1902.|$|E
40|$|Rotation {{has been}} studied in noneruptive limb prominences; in most cases, Dopplergrams {{could be used to}} confirm proper motion measurments. In some cases, part of the <b>prominence</b> rotates; <b>in</b> the others, the entire body is in rotation. Velocities of 15 - 75 km/sec are found.

5|$|Despite {{the common}} {{period in which}} castles rose to <b>prominence</b> <b>in</b> Europe, their form and design varied from region to region. In the early 11thcentury, the motte and keep– an {{artificial}} mound surmounted by a palisade and tower– {{was the most common}} form of castle in Europe, everywhere except Scandinavia. While Britain, France, and Italy shared a tradition of timber construction that was continued in castle architecture, Spain more commonly used stone or mud-brick as the main building material.|$|E
5|$|Freedom fries was a {{political}} euphemism for French fries in the United States. The term came to <b>prominence</b> <b>in</b> 2003 when the then Republican Chairman of the Committee on House Administration, Bob Ney, renamed the menu item in three Congressional cafeterias in response to France's opposition to the proposed invasion of Iraq. Although originally supported with several restaurants changing their menus as well, the term fell out of use due to declining support for the Iraq War. Following Ney's resignation as Chairman in 2006, it was quietly reverted.|$|E
5|$|French Sudan {{originally}} {{formed as}} a set of military outposts {{as an extension of the}} French colony in Senegal. Though the area offered France little economic or strategic gain, the military effectively advocated greater conquest in the region.
