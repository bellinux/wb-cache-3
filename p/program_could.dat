5|$|This {{situation}} improved as COBOL adopted more features. COBOL-74 added subprograms, giving programmers {{the ability}} to control the data each part of the <b>program</b> <b>could</b> access. COBOL-85 then added nested subprograms, allowing programmers to hide subprograms. Further control over data and code came in 2002 when object-oriented programming, user-defined functions and user-defined data types were included.|$|E
5|$|Ryan {{is called}} back to his company's offices in Omaha, Nebraska. Natalie Keener, a young and ambitious new hire, {{promotes}} {{a program designed to}} cut costs by conducting layoffs via videoconferencing. Ryan raises concerns that the <b>program</b> <b>could</b> be seen as detached and apathetic, arguing that Natalie knows nothing about the reality of the firing process or how to handle upset people. He then plays the role of a fired employee to demonstrate her inexperience. Ryan's boss assigns him to bring Natalie on his next round of terminations to show her the ropes.|$|E

25|$|The MSRE was a {{core region}} only {{prototype}} reactor. The MSRE provided valuable long-term operating experience. According to estimates of Japanese scientists, a single fluid LFTR <b>program</b> <b>could</b> {{be achieved through}} a relatively modest investment of roughly 300-400 million dollars over 5–10 years to fund research to fill minor technical gaps and build a small reactor prototype comparable to the MSRE.|$|E
25|$|Also {{during this}} era, private birth control clinics were {{established}} in Puerto Rico with funds provided by wealthy Americans. Joseph Sunnen, a wealthy American Republican and industrialist, established the Sunnen Foundation in 1957. The foundation funded new birth control clinics under the title “La Asociación Puertorriqueña el Biensestar de la Familia” and spent {{hundreds of thousands of}} dollars in an experimental project to determine if a formulaic <b>program</b> <b>could</b> be used to control population growth in Puerto Rico and beyond.|$|E

25|$|The CMG {{control program}} was {{responsible}} for {{making sure that the}} gimbals never hit the stops, by redistributing angular momentum between the three rotors to bring large gimbal angles closer to zero. Since the total angular momentum to be stored had only three degrees of freedom, while the control <b>program</b> <b>could</b> change six independent variables (the three pairs of gimbal angles), the program had sufficient freedom of action to do this while still obeying other constraints such as avoiding anti-parallel alignments.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of December 1998, a newspaper reported that the Federal Ministry of Transport had issued an order to stop work on {{the southern part of}} the new line so that the work <b>program</b> <b>could</b> be examined. The northern section that was being built along with the A71 was not affected. After the Federal Ministry of Transport initially stopped pre-construction activities in July 1999 as a result of tight budgets, some work, mainly consisting of pre-construction work, was carried out in 2003 and 2004.|$|E
25|$|Since 2005, Iran's {{nuclear program}} {{has become the}} subject of {{contention}} with the international community, mainly the United States, following earlier quotes of Iranian leadership favoring {{the use of an}} atomic bomb against Iran's enemies and in particular Israel. Many countries have expressed concern that Iran's nuclear <b>program</b> <b>could</b> divert civilian nuclear technology into a weapons program. This has led the United Nations Security Council to impose sanctions against Iran which had further isolated Iran politically and economically {{from the rest of the}} global community. In 2009, the U.S. Director of National Intelligence said that Iran, if choosing to, would not be able to develop a nuclear weapon until 2013.|$|E

25|$|The Turbo name {{alluded to}} the speed of {{compilation}} and of the executables produced. The edit/compile/run cycle was fast compared to other Pascal implementations because everything related to building the program was stored in RAM, {{and because it was}} a one-pass compiler written in assembly language. Compilation was much faster than compilers for other languages (even Borland's own later compilers for C), and other Pascal compilers, and programmer time was also saved since the <b>program</b> <b>could</b> be compiled and run from the IDE. The execution speed of these COM-format programs was a revelation for developers whose only prior experience programming microcomputers was with interpreted BASIC or UCSD Pascal, which compiled to p-code which was then interpreted at runtime.|$|E
25|$|Subsequent to the {{findings}} of the Augustine Committee in 2009 that the Constellation <b>Program</b> <b>could</b> not be executed without substantial increases in funding, on February 1, 2010, President Barack Obama announced a proposal to cancel the program, effective {{with the passage of the}} U.S. 2011 fiscal year budget, but later announced changes to the proposal in a major space policy speech at Kennedy Space Center on April 15, 2010. Obama signed the NASA Authorization Act of 2010 on October 11, which shelved the program, with Constellation contracts remaining in place until Congress would act to overturn the previous mandate. In 2011, NASA announced that it had adopted the design of its new Space Launch System.|$|E
25|$|Michigan State University, Rowan University, and Nova Southeastern University offer both MD and DO {{accredited}} programs. In 2009, Kansas City University proposed {{starting a}} dual MD/DO program {{in addition to}} the existing DO program, and the University of North Texas explored the possibility of starting an MD program that would be offered alongside the DO program. Both proposals were met with controversy. Proponents argued that adding an MD program would lead to the creation of more local residency programs and improve the university’s ability to acquire research funding and state funding. Opponents argue that adding an MD <b>program</b> <b>could</b> cause the DO program to lose its unique identity and drain resources from the established osteopathic program.|$|E

25|$|In the 2012–13 season, Barnes' Longhorns {{finished}} 16–18 {{and missed}} their first NCAA tournament since 1997–98—the season prior to Barnes' arrival. This began a slow, yet cascading trend by fans and media to replace {{what had become}} Texas' winningest basketball coach. Not much change was expected, but turbulence within the Texas athletic department ensued following Dodds' retirement in 2013. New UT Athletic Director Steve Patterson set out to dramatically change the entire Longhorn program, with the resignation of popular football coach Mack Brown following the 2013 football season. Fans and media began to speculate that Barnes' job was at similar risk; even in recruiting—seen as Barnes' specialty—the <b>program</b> <b>could</b> not capture much of the elite Texas talent that had begun to emerge in recent seasons.|$|E
25|$|After {{a series}} of {{hearings}} beginning in September 1949, the FCC found the RCA and CTI systems fraught with technical problems, inaccurate color reproduction, and expensive equipment, and so formally approved the CBS system as the U.S. color broadcasting standard on October 11, 1950. An unsuccessful lawsuit by RCA delayed the first commercial network broadcast in color until June 25, 1951, when a musical variety special titled simply Premiere was shown over a network of five East Coast CBS affiliates. Viewing was again restricted: the <b>program</b> <b>could</b> not be seen on black-and-white sets, and Variety estimated that only thirty prototype color receivers were available in the New York area. Regular color broadcasts began that same week with the daytime series The World Is Yours and Modern Homemakers.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to I Love Lucy, he executive produced The Ann Sothern Show and Those Whiting Girls (starring Margaret Whiting and Barbara Whiting Smith), and {{was involved in}} several other series such as The Untouchables, Whirlybirds, and Sheriff of Cochise / United States Marshal. He also produced the feature film Forever, Darling (1956), in which Ball and he starred. In the late 1950s, Arnaz proposed a Western television series to his then neighbor, Victor Orsatti, who formed a production company, Ror-Vic, in partnership with actor Rory Calhoun. Ror-Vic produced The Texan, which aired on Monday evenings on CBS from 1958 to 1960. Episodes were budgeted at $40,000 each, with two black-and-white segments filmed weekly through Desilu Studios. Despite the name, the series was mostly in Pearl Flats in the Mojave Desert of Southern California. The <b>program</b> <b>could</b> have been renewed for a third season had Calhoun not desired to return to films.|$|E
