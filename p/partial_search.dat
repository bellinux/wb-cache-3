40|$|Fast search {{algorithms}} for block {{motion estimation}} reduce {{the set of}} possible displacements for locating the motion vector. All algorithms produce some quality degradation of the predicted image. To reduce the computational complexity of the full search algorithm without introducing any loss in the predicted image, we propose a Hilbert-grouped <b>partial</b> distortion <b>search</b> algorithm (HGPDS) by grouping the representative pixels based on pixel activities in the hilbert scan. By using the grouped information and computing the accumulated partial distortion of the representative pixels before that of other pixels, impossible candidates can be rejected sooner and the remaining computation involved in the matching criterion can be reduced remarkably. In addition, we also suggest a smart search strategy which is an excellent complement of the HGPDS to form an efficient <b>partial</b> distortion <b>search</b> algorithm. The new search strategy rearranges the search order such that the most possible candidates are searched first and this rearrangement will increase the probability of early rejection of impossible motion vectors.

Here, we use model-based behavioral analysis to provide a detailed examination of the performance of human subjects in a moderately deep planning task. We find that subjects exploit the structure of the domain to establish subgoals in a way that achieves a nearly maximal reduction in the cost of computing values of choices, but then combine <b>partial</b> <b>searches</b> with greedy local steps to solve subtasks, and maladaptively prune the decision trees of subtasks in a reflexive manner upon encountering salient losses.

40|$|Abstract — Motion {{estimation}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} computational-intensive tasks in video compression. In order to reduce the amount of computation, various fast motion estimation algorithms have been developed. These fast algorithms can be classified into two groups. One is the lossy motion-estimation approach, which may have some degradation of predicted images, and the other is lossless, which means that the quality of the predicted images is exactly the same as those obtained by the conventional full <b>search</b> algorithm. The <b>partial</b> distortion <b>search</b> and successive elimination algorithm are two well-known techniques belonging to the second kind of approach. These two algorithms use different checking criteria to eliminate as much redundant computations as possible. Actually, the working principles of these methods are independent to each others and it is possible to apply them sequentially in order to achieve greater saving in computation. In this paper, we propose a new fast full-search motion estimation algorithm which can exploit fully the advantages of adaptive <b>partial</b> distortion <b>search</b> and successive elimination algorithm. Experimental results show that this proposed algorithm has an average speed-up of 13. 31 as compared with the full search algorithm in terms of computational efficiency. This result is much better than the method simply combing both <b>partial</b> distortion <b>search</b> and successive elimination algorithm, which has an average computational speed-up of 10. 60. For a practical realization using a PC, the average execution time speed-up for our algorithm is 4. 96, which is also the best performance among all algorithms tested. I...|$|R
