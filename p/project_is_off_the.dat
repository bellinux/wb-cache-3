5000|$|The high-explosive squash head (HESH) was {{developed}} by Charles Dennistoun Burney in the 1940s for the British war effort, originally as an anti-fortification [...] "wallbuster" [...] munition for use against concrete. HESH rounds were thin metal shells filled with plastic explosive and a delayed-action base fuze. The plastic explosive is [...] "squashed" [...] against {{the surface of the}} target on impact and spreads out to form a disc or [...] "pat" [...] of explosive. The base fuze detonates the explosive milliseconds later, creating a shock wave that, owing to its large surface area and direct contact with the target, is transmitted through the material. At the point where the compression and tension waves intersect a high-stress zone is created in the metal, causing pieces of steel to <b>be</b> <b>projected</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> interior wall at high velocity. This fragmentation by blast wave is known as spalling, with the fragments themselves known as spall. Unlike high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rounds, which are shaped charge ammunition, HESH shells are not specifically designed to perforate the armour of main battle tanks. HESH shells rely instead on the transmission of the shock wave through the solid steel armour.|$|R
40|$|Smart parking {{management}} technologies {{may provide}} a cost-effective tool to address near-term parking constraints at transit stations. Smart parking management systems have been implemented in numerous European, British, and Japanese cities to more efficiently use parking capacity at transit stations by providing real-time information via variable message signs to motorists about available parking spaces in park-and-ride lots. This paper describes the results of initial focus groups and surveys of participants in a smart parking field operational test, which was launched at a San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) District station in Oakland, California on December 8, 2004. Insights into the <b>project’s</b> travel effects <b>are</b> gained from an analysis of participant travel behavior before they started using the service. The {{results indicate that the}} <b>project</b> <b>is</b> attracting new (14 percent) and infrequent BART commuters (25 percent). While some participants may drive further (two miles on average) to access the Rockridge BART station, where the field test is based, the magnitude of this increase is unlikely to off-set total auto travel reductions (an average of 18 miles) due to shifts from auto to BART for commute trips. Thus, it appears that the smart parking <b>project</b> <b>is</b> getting cars <b>off</b> <b>the</b> road during peak periods and onto transit.

The base fuze detonates the explosive milliseconds later, creating a shock wave that, owing to its large surface area and direct contact with the target, is transmitted through the material. In the case of the metal armour of a tank, the compression shock wave is conducted through the armour {{to the point where it}} reaches the metal/air interface (the hollow crew compartment), where some of the energy is reflected as a tension wave.

That included a free access coal terminal of projected capacity at 20 million tonnes a year. In the autumn of 2012, Port Managing Company LLC (the executive body of JSC Vostochny Port) decided to start {{the implementation of a}} large-scale investment project of the dedicated coal complex Vostochny Port Phase Three to be financed through its own funds, without financial burden on the federal and regional budgets. The third phase is expansion of the existing Coal Transshipment Complex of Vostochny Port and includes a 100% automated terminal for coal transfer from railway to sea-going transport coupled with services for maintaining quality during loads storage and processing.The P3 project involves the construction of four storage facilities with a total capacity of 780,000 tonnes and two loading berths, installation at the complex of state-of-the-art material handling and processing equipment. PMC has invested more RUB 19 billion (of the planned RUB 27 bn). As of now the construction of an artificial land territory stretching far into the bay has been completed as well as a berth. The Port P3 will be equipped with the most productive modern equipment supplied from Japan. The handling equipment includes two tandem railcar dumpers for heavy haul gondola cars that allow discharging loads from four 70-tonne cars in just three minutes, two stackers and four reclaimers of capacity of 3,500 tonnes / hour.

40|$|The newly-revised SFAS No. 141 (R), Business Combinations, {{offers some}} {{important}} changes in accounting for in-process {{research and development}} (IPR&D). Long expensed {{at the time of}} acquisition, IPR&D will henceforth be capitalized and subsequently amortized, though abandoned <b>projects</b> will <b>be</b> written <b>off.</b> <b>The</b> expectation <b>is</b> that earnings in years following an acquisition will be lower, though the impact is entirely dependent on whether new acquisitions result in additional amounts of capitalized IPR&D and the amortization period for previously-capitalized amounts. In this study we look at the significance of IPR&D over the period 1998 through 2006 relative to selected measures, including net sales and total assets, for a large cross-section of firms and within five technology industries. We then recast pretax income in 2006 for our sample and for fifteen firms from the five industries assuming IPR&D incurred over the 2003 – 2005 time period had been capitalized and subsequently amortized. Across our sample period we find that the median firm that incurs IPR&D spends about 1. 47 % of sales and. 91 % of assets on those acquired projects. The effects, however, in certain industries and at selected companies were much greater. We also find that pretax income in 2006 is reduced by approximately 1. 12 % if IPR&D were capitalized and amortized over afive-year period. What is unclear {{is the extent to which}} companies may need to take charges for IPR&D projects abandoned in the future. Analysts and investors will want to be prepared for all of these changes as they begin to review financial statements for technology firms in 2009 and beyond...|$|R

40|$|Rotary mills {{are used}} {{extensively}} {{to reduce the}} coarse rocks of mined ores down to a product fine enough to facilitate the extraction of the valuable minerals. On the South African gold mines alone about 110 million tons of ore is mined annually, at a power cost of about R 90 million, and a liner material cost of about R 30 million. The charge motion in mills has been studied both theoretically and experimentally {{since the beginning of}} the century. However, a lot of the work has been purely empirical, and some of it illconceived, resulting in there still being a poor understanding of the topic. The influence of lifter-bars upon charge motion has only been considered in the past few decades, and mostly to a very limited extent. This state of affairs has left the field wide open to further research. The charge motion of an isolated rod or ball, and how it is influenced by a flat-faced lifter-bar of any face-angle and of any height, was modelled theoretically. The charge motion of rods in a glass-ended mill was filmed with a high-speed camera. The mill was fitted with a variety of lifter-bars with different face-angles and heights, and was run at a wide range of speeds. The filmed trajectories of the rods were then tracked. The coefficients of friction between the rods and lifter-bar material were measured under vibrating conditions as are found in the mill. The power draw of the mill was also measured at a wide range of mill speeds, and with lifter-bars of different heights in the mill. A good correlation between the theoretical predictions and experimental results was found over a wide range of conditions. The impact point, at which the grinding element strikes the mill shell, was considered to be of primary importance in the analysis. It was found that the height of the lifter-bar has a strong influence on charge trajectories, as the height increases from zero up to just greater than one charge radius. Thereafter the lift increases until a critical lifter-bar height is reached, beyond which <b>the</b> grinding element <b>is</b> <b>projected</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> lifter prior to reaching the tip, the height of the impact point increasing slightly and then decreasing to a constant height. However, the change in the height of the impact point is very small, so in practical terms an increase in lifter-bar height, once it is higher than the radius of the grinding element, has a very small effect upon the charge trajectories. An increase in the angle of the lifter-bars was found to have a strong influence upon the height of the charge trajectories. A linear relationship between the mill speed and the impact angle was dicovered, and changes in the mill speed strongly influence the charge trajectories. It was also found that the power draw of a mill depends on the liner configuration, with power draw decreasing as the lifter-bar height is increased. Some new and surprising effects of lifter-bar geometry upon the charge trajectories, which are of great practical importance, have been discovered. The theoretical model is an advance upon all previous models, and agrees well with experimental results over a wide range of conditions...|$|R
