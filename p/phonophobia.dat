50|$|In adults, {{the most}} common symptom of {{meningitis}} is a severe headache, occurring in almost 90% of cases of bacterial meningitis, followed by nuchal rigidity (the inability to flex the neck forward passively due to increased neck muscle tone and stiffness). The classic triad of diagnostic signs consists of nuchal rigidity, sudden high fever, and altered mental status; however, all three features are present in only 44-46% of bacterial meningitis cases. If {{none of the three}} signs are present, acute meningitis is extremely unlikely. Other signs commonly associated with meningitis include photophobia (intolerance to bright light) and <b>phonophobia</b> (intolerance to loud noises). Small children often do not exhibit the aforementioned symptoms, and may only be irritable and look unwell. The fontanelle (the soft spot {{on the top of a}} baby's head) can bulge in infants aged up to 6 months. Other features that distinguish meningitis from less severe illnesses in young children are leg pain, cold extremities, and an abnormal skin color.|$|E
5000|$|Hypnic {{headaches}} are benign primary headaches {{that affect}} the elderly, with {{the average age of}} onset being 63 ± 11 years. [...] They are moderate, throbbing, bilateral or unilateral headaches that wake the sufferer from sleep once or multiple times a night. [...] They typically begin a few hours after sleep begins and can last from 15-180 min. [...] There is normally no nausea, photophobia, <b>phonophobia</b> or autonomic symptoms associated with the headache. They commonly occur at the same time every night possibly linking the headaches with circadian rhythm, but polysomnography has recently revealed that the onset of hypnic headaches may be associated with REM sleep.Lithium carbonate 200-600 mg at bedtime is an effective treatment for most patients but for those that can not tolerate Lithium, Verapamil, indomethacin or methylsergilide may be tried. Two patients have also responded to flunarizine 5 mg. It has also been shown that 1-2 cups of coffee or 100-200 mg of caffeine before bed can prevent hypnic headaches.|$|E
40|$|Our {{objective}} was to compare the presence of self-reported unilateral photophobia or <b>phonophobia,</b> or both, during headache attacks comparing patients with trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (TACs) -including cluster headache, short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT) and paroxysmal hemicrania-or hemicrania continua, and other headache types. We conducted a prospective study in patients attending a referral out-patient clinic over 5 months and those admitted for an intramuscular indomethacin test. Two hundred and six patients were included. In episodic migraine patients, two of 54 (4 %) reported unilateral photophobia or <b>phonophobia,</b> or both. In chronic migraine patients, six of 48 (13 %) complained of unilateral photophobia or <b>phonophobia,</b> or both, whereas none of the 24 patients with medication-overuse headache reported these unilateral symptoms, although these patients all had clinical symptoms suggesting the diagnosis of migraine. Only three of 22 patients (14 %) suffering from new daily persistent headache (NDPH) experienced unilateral photophobia or <b>phonophobia.</b> In chronic cluster headache 10 of 21 patients (48 %) had unilateral photophobia or <b>phonophobia,</b> or both, and this symptom appeared in four of five patients (80 %) with episodic cluster headache. Unilateral photophobia or <b>phonophobia,</b> or both, were reported by six of 11 patients (55 %) with hemicrania continua, five of nine (56 %) with SUNCT, and four of six (67 %) with chronic paroxysmal hemicrania. Unilateral <b>phonophobia</b> or photophobia, or both, are more frequent in TACs and hemicrania continua than in migraine and NDPH.

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective To {{determine}} whether <b>phonophobia</b> and dynamic mechanical (brush) allodynia are associated in episodic migraine (EM). Methods Adult patients with EM were prospectively recruited. A structured questionnaire {{was used to}} obtain demographic and migraine related data. <b>Phonophobia</b> was tested quantitatively using a real time sound processor and psychoacoustic software. Sound stimuli were pure tones at frequencies of 1000 Hz, 4000 Hz and 8000 Hz, delivered to both ears at increasing intensities, until an aversive level was reached. Allodynia was assessed by brushing the patient’s skin with a gauze pad at different areas. Patients were tested both between and during acute attacks. Sound aversion thresholds (SATs) in allodynic and non-allodynic patients were compared. Results Between attacks, SATs were lower in allodynic compared with non-allodynic patients, with an average difference of 5. 7 dB (p¼ 0. 04). During acute attacks, the corresponding average SAT difference (allodynicenon-allodynic) was 15. 7 dB (p¼ 0. 0008). There was a significant negative correlation between allodynia scores and SATs, both within and between attacks.
