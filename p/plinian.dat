5|$|Mount St. Helens, which {{exhibited}} phreatic activity {{just prior}} to its catastrophic 1980 eruption (which was itself <b>Plinian).</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Plinian</b> eruptions {{are similar}} to both Vulcanian and Strombolian eruptions, except that rather than {{creating}} discrete explosive events, <b>Plinian</b> eruptions form sustained eruptive columns. They are also similar to Hawaiian lava fountains in that both eruptive types produce sustained eruption columns maintained by the growth of bubbles that move up {{at about the same}} speed as the magma surrounding them.|$|E
5|$|The 1980 {{eruption}} of Mount St. Helens in Washington, which ripped apart the volcano's summit, was a <b>Plinian</b> {{eruption of}} Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) 5.|$|E
5|$|The volcano then {{entered a}} stage of more frequent, but less violent eruptions, until the most recent <b>Plinian</b> eruption, which {{destroyed}} Pompeii and Herculaneum.|$|E
5|$|Hekla in Iceland, {{an example}} of basaltic <b>Plinian</b> {{volcanism}} being its 1947–48 eruption. The past 800 years have been a pattern of violent initial eruptions of pumice followed by prolonged extrusion of basaltic lava from {{the lower part of}} the volcano.|$|E
5|$|In Darwin's {{second year}} at the {{university}} he joined the <b>Plinian</b> Society, a student natural-history group featuring lively debates in which radical democratic students with materialistic views challenged orthodox religious concepts of science. He assisted Robert Edmond Grant's investigations of the anatomy and life cycle of marine invertebrates in the Firth of Forth, and on 27 March 1827 presented at the <b>Plinian</b> his own discovery that black spores found in oyster shells were the eggs of a skate leech. One day, Grant praised Lamarck's evolutionary ideas. Darwin was astonished by Grant's audacity, but had recently read similar ideas in his grandfather Erasmus' journals. Darwin was rather bored by Robert Jameson's natural-history course, which covered geology – including the debate between Neptunism and Plutonism. He learned the classification of plants, and assisted with work on the collections of the University Museum, {{one of the largest}} museums in Europe at the time.|$|E
5|$|<b>Plinian</b> eruptions (or Vesuvian) are {{a type of}} {{volcanic}} eruption, named for the historical eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD that buried the Roman towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum and, specifically, for its chronicler Pliny the Younger. The process powering <b>Plinian</b> eruptions starts in the magma chamber, where dissolved volatile gases are stored in the magma. The gases vesiculate and accumulate as they rise through the magma conduit. These bubbles agglutinate and once they reach a certain size (about 75% of the total volume of the magma conduit) they explode. The narrow confines of the conduit force the gases and associated magma up, forming an eruptive column. Eruption velocity {{is controlled by the}} gas contents of the column, and low-strength surface rocks commonly crack under the pressure of the eruption, forming a flared outgoing structure that pushes the gases even faster.|$|E
5|$|Built {{on top of}} an {{alluvial}} fan that had been host to historic lahars, the town was previously destroyed by a volcanic eruption in 1595 and by mudflows in 1845. In the 1595 eruption, three distinct <b>Plinian</b> eruptions produced lahars that claimed the lives of 636people. During the 1845 event, 1,000people were killed by earthquake-generated mudflows near the Magdalena River.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, {{the cloud}} {{collapsed}} as the gases expanded and lost their capability {{to support their}} solid contents, releasing it as a pyroclastic surge, which first reached Herculaneum but not Pompeii. Additional blasts reinstituted the column. The eruption alternated between <b>Plinian</b> and Peléan six times. Surges 3 and 4 are believed by the authors to have buried Pompeii. Surges are identified in the deposits by dune and cross-bedding formations, which are not produced by fallout.|$|E
5|$|These highly {{explosive}} eruptions {{are associated}} with volatile-rich dacitic to rhyolitic lavas, and occur most typically at stratovolcanoes. Eruptions can last anywhere from hours to days, with longer eruptions being associated with more felsic volcanoes. Although they {{are associated with}} felsic magma, <b>Plinian</b> eruptions can just as well occur at basaltic volcanoes, given that the magma chamber differentiates and has a structure rich in silicon dioxide.|$|E
5|$|Vesuvius has erupted {{many times}} since {{and is the}} only volcano on the European {{mainland}} to have erupted within the last hundred years. Today, it is {{regarded as one of the}} most dangerous volcanoes in the world because of the population of 3,000,000 people living nearby and its tendency towards violent, explosive eruptions of the <b>Plinian</b> type, making it the most densely populated volcanic region in the world.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known about Silverthrone’s eruptive history. However, as at other calderas, eruptions at Silverthrone are {{explosive}} in nature, involving viscous magma, glowing avalanches of hot volcanic ash and pyroclastic flows. The source magma of this rock is classified as acidic, having high to intermediate levels of silica, as in rhyolite, dacite, and andesite. Andesitic and rhyolitic magma are commonly associated with the two forms of explosive eruptions called <b>Plinian</b> and Peléan eruptions. Silverthrone is considerably younger than its nearest prominent neighbour Franklin Glacier Volcano to the east-southeast.|$|E
5|$|Nevado del Ruiz {{lies within}} the Pacific Ring of Fire, {{a region that}} encircles the Pacific Ocean and {{contains}} some of the world's most active volcanoes. It is the third most northerly of the volcanoes lying in the North Volcanic Zone of the Andean Volcanic Belt, which contains 75 of the 204 Holocene-age volcanoes in South America. The Andean Volcanic Belt is produced by the eastward subduction of the oceanic Nazca Plate beneath the South American continental plate. As {{is the case for}} many subduction-zone volcanoes, Nevado del Ruiz can generate explosive <b>Plinian</b> eruptions with associated pyroclastic flows that can melt snow and glaciers near the summit, producing large and sometimes devastating lahars (mud and debris flows).|$|E
5|$|Volcanic eruptions {{vary widely}} in strength. On the one extreme there are effusive Hawaiian eruptions, which are {{characterized}} by lava fountains and fluid lava flows, which are typically not very dangerous. On the other extreme, <b>Plinian</b> eruptions are large, violent, and highly dangerous explosive events. Volcanoes are not bound to one eruptive style, and frequently display many different types, both passive and explosive, even {{in the span of}} a single eruptive cycle. Volcanoes do not always erupt vertically from a single crater near their peak, either. Some volcanoes exhibit lateral and fissure eruptions. Notably, many Hawaiian eruptions start from rift zones, and some of the strongest Surtseyan eruptions develop along fracture zones. Scientists believed that pulses of magma mixed together in the chamber before climbing upward—a process estimated to take several thousands of years. But Columbia University volcanologists found that the eruption of Costa Rica’s Irazú Volcano in 1963 was likely triggered by magma that took a nonstop route from the mantle over just a few months.|$|E
25|$|On {{the south}} side of the Khutzeymateen Inlet north of Prince Rupert, thick basaltic <b>Plinian</b> {{eruption}} tephra deposits are recognized at Crow Lagoon. These volcanics originated from a volcanic vent that remains unidentified. However, existence of volcanic bombs at the <b>Plinian</b> tephra deposits indicates the volcanic vent of its origin is located nearby. The age of these volcanics is unknown but they were deposited throughout the Holocene epoch.|$|E
25|$|The volcano's Ultra <b>Plinian</b> {{eruption}} on June 15, 1991, {{produced the}} second-largest terrestrial eruption of the 20th century after the 1912 eruption of Novarupta in the Alaska Peninsula.|$|E
25|$|A {{particularly}} violent explosive (<b>Plinian)</b> {{summit eruption}} occurred in 122BC, and caused heavy tephra {{falls to the}} southeast, including the town of Catania, where many roofs collapsed. To help with reconstruction after the devastating effects of the eruption, the Roman government exempted the population of Catania from paying taxes for ten years.|$|E
25|$|On May 18, 1980, {{the upper}} 460 metres (1,509 feet) of Mount St. Helens collapsed, {{creating}} a massive landslide. This released {{the pressure on}} the magma trapped beneath the summit bulge which exploded as a lateral blast, which then released {{the pressure on the}} magma chamber and resulted in a <b>plinian</b> eruption.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{scattering}} {{can also be}} from sulfate particles. For years after large <b>Plinian</b> eruptions, the blue cast of the sky is notably brightened by the persistent sulfate load of the stratospheric gases. Some works of the artist J. M. W. Turner may owe their vivid red colours to the eruption of Mount Tambora in his lifetime.|$|E
25|$|If it does happen, then {{material}} {{reaching the}} bottom of the convective thrust region can no longer be adequately supported by convection and will fall under gravity, forming a pyroclastic flow or surge which can travel down the flanks of a volcano at speeds of over 100km/h. Column collapse {{is one of the most}} common and dangerous volcanic hazards in a <b>plinian</b> eruption.|$|E
25|$|A 2-km-wide postglacial caldera {{is located}} {{at the base of the}} {{presently}} active, dominantly basaltic-to-andesitic cone at the northwest margin of the Pleistocene caldera. About 25 scoria cones dot Villarica's flanks. <b>Plinian</b> eruptions and pyroclastic flows have been produced during the Holocene from this dominantly basaltic volcano, but historical eruptions have consisted of largely mild-to-moderate explosive activity with occasional lava effusion. Lahars from the glacier-covered volcanoes have damaged towns on its flanks.|$|E
25|$|Eruptions of Nemrut {{were mainly}} of <b>Plinian</b> type. Their {{products}} are mainly alkaline {{and include a}} wide range of lavas: from basalt to rhyolite and phonolite, as well as pyroclastic emissions and slag. Eruption of different periods were either effused or explosive. Nemrut is located on a fault that crosses the volcano from the north to the south and contains the main crater and a number of small craters, maars, hot springs and fumaroles.|$|E
25|$|A {{volatile}} phase containing chlorine formed {{inside the}} magma chamber and quickly removed most sulfur from the magma. This sulfur extraction was {{facilitated by the}} high oxygen content of the magma, which facilitated the formation of sulfur dioxide. Water is a principal volatile involved in the processes of <b>Plinian</b> eruptions; the water content of the Soncor and Piedras Grandes magmas was about 4–5%. The Soncor magmas were associated with a volatile phase that underwent extensive interaction with the future eruption products.|$|E
25|$|John Hutton Balfour {{joined the}} <b>Plinian</b> in 1827 and Hugh Falconer in 1828. Balfour {{took up the}} Chair of Botany at Edinburgh in 1845 and was, for many years, Dean of the Faculty of Medicine; his sister, Magdalene Balfour, married William A.F. Browne and bore him eight children, {{including}} James Crichton-Browne. The Baird brothers made occasional appearances after graduation, then in the 1829–1830 session they returned to Berwickshire, with two of them becoming ministers of local parishes. The society collapsed in 1841.|$|E
25|$|Mayon Volcano is the Philippines' {{most active}} volcano. It has steep upper slopes that average 35–40° and is capped {{by a small}} summit crater. The {{historical}} eruptions of this basaltic-andesitic volcano dates back to 1616 and ranges from Strombolian to basaltic <b>Plinian</b> eruptions. Eruptions occur predominately from the central conduit and have also produced lava flows that travel far down the flanks. Pyroclastic flows and mudflows have commonly swept down many of the roughly 40 ravines that radiate from the summit and have often devastated populated lowland areas.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 47 eruptions of VEI 8 {{magnitude}} or above, {{ranging in age}} from Ordovician to Pleistocene, have been identified, of which 42 occurred in the past 36 million years. The most recent is Lake Taupo's Oruanui eruption, 25,360 years ago, which means that there have not been any Holocene (within the last 10,000 years) eruptions with a VEI of 8. There have been at least five identified Holocene eruptions with a VEI of 7. There are also 58 <b>plinian</b> eruptions, and 13 caldera-forming eruptions, of large, but unknown magnitudes. There are likely many other eruptions that are not identified.|$|E
25|$|The Garibaldi Volcanic Belt is a northwest-southeast {{trending}} volcanic {{chain in}} the Pacific Ranges of the Coast Mountains that extends from Watts Point {{in the south}} to the Ha-Iltzuk Icefield in the north. This chain of volcanoes is located in southwestern British Columbia, Canada. It forms the northernmost segment of the Cascade Volcanic Arc, which includes Mount St. Helens and Mount Baker. Most volcanoes of the Garibaldi chain are dormant stratovolcanoes and subglacial volcanoes that have been eroded by glacial ice. Less common volcanic landforms include cinder cones, volcanic plugs, lava domes and calderas. These diverse formations were created by different styles of volcanic activity, including Peléan and <b>Plinian</b> eruptions.|$|E
25|$|Pumice is {{composed}} of highly microvesicular glass pyroclastic with very thin, translucent bubble walls of extrusive igneous rock. It is commonly, but not exclusively of silicic or felsic to intermediate in composition (e.g., rhyolitic, dacitic, andesite, pantellerite, phonolite, trachyte), but basaltic and other compositions are known. Pumice is commonly pale in color, ranging from white, cream, blue or grey, to green-brown or black. It forms when volcanic gases exsolving from viscous magma form bubbles that remain within the viscous magma as it cools to glass. Pumice is a common product of explosive eruptions (<b>plinian</b> and ignimbrite-forming) and commonly forms zones in upper parts of silicic lavas. Pumice has an average porosity of 90%, and initially floats on water.|$|E
25|$|A VEI 3 {{eruption}} occurred from 17 January 1991 to 11 March 1991, producing 0.15km3 of lava and 2×107m3 of tephra. The eruption, {{which was}} preceded by sulphurous smells and earthquakes, started as a <b>Plinian</b> eruption, producing an ash cloud reaching an altitude of 11.5km within 10minutes which had travelled over 200km north-northeast to the coast within 3hours. The eruption then began producing andesitic lava, the flows eventually covering an area of 23km2 to an average depth of 6–7m. Initially, part of the Heklugja fissure and other fissures erupted with lava fountains reaching 300m in height. By the second day, the activity stopped {{in all but one}} fissure where the main crater formed. During these 2days, 800m3·s−1 of lava were produced, slowing to between 1m3s−1 and 14m3·s−1 for most of the eruption. This low viscosity lava had a SiO2 content of approximately 54%.|$|E
25|$|Mount Bandai, one of Japan's most noted volcanoes, {{rises above}} {{the north shore of}} Lake Inawashiro. Mount Bandai is formed of several {{overlapping}} stratovolcanoes, the largest of which is O-Bandai forming a complex volcano. O-Bandai volcano was constructed within a horseshoe-shaped caldera that formed about 40,000 years when an earlier volcano collapsed, forming the Okinajima debris avalanche, which traveled to the southwest and was accompanied by a <b>plinian</b> eruption. Four major phreatic eruptions have occurred during the past 5,000 years, two of them in historical time, in 806 and 1888. Seen from the south, Bandai presents a conical profile, but much of {{the north side of the}} volcano is missing as a result of the collapse of Ko-Bandai volcano during the 1888 eruption, in which a debris avalanche buried several villages and formed several large lakes.|$|E
25|$|Mount Price is {{near the}} highly {{populated}} southwest corner of British Columbia, indicating that it poses {{a serious threat to}} the surrounding area. Even though <b>Plinian</b> eruptions have not been identified at Mount Price, Peléan eruptions can also produce large amounts of volcanic ash that could significantly affect the nearby communities of Whistler and Squamish. Mount Price is also situated in the immediate proximity of a major air traffic route. Volcanic ash reduces visibility and can cause jet engine failure, as well as damage to other aircraft systems. Peléan eruptions may cause short and long term water supply problems for the city of Vancouver and most of the Lower Mainland. The catchment area for the Greater Vancouver watershed is downwind from Mount Price. An eruption producing floods and lahars could destroy parts of the Sea to Sky Highway, threaten communities such as Brackendale and endanger water supplies from Pitt Lake. Fisheries on the Pitt River would also be at risk. These volcanic hazards become more serious as the Lower Mainland grows in population. More than 60% of British Columbia's people live in the Lower Mainland and it is one of Canada's most rapidly changing ecoregions. This is mostly because of its increasing population and economic development.|$|E
500|$|Quizapu, which formed {{during the}} 1846 eruption, {{is the most}} {{prominent}} crater. It {{is also known as}} Cerro del Medio ("Middle Hill") or Volcan Nuevo ("New Volcano"). The volcanic vent formed during an effusive eruption involving hornblende–dacite flows accompanied by tephra, and the crater was excavated by phreatic and Strombolian eruptions between 1907 and 1932. Pent-up pressure within the volcano spawned an enormous <b>Plinian</b> eruption in 1932. The volume of lava ejected during this single event is roughly equal to that ejected {{during the rest of the}} eruptive history at Quizapu, since its formation in 1846. Although [...] of material was ejected, no subsidence was detected from the removal of magma. Because of aerodynamic drag, a <b>Plinian</b> eruption excavates a circular crater. As the earlier eruptions had already formed an approximately circular caldera, the <b>Plinian</b> eruption was able to proceed efficiently, with minimal drag and minimal reshaping of the crater.|$|E
500|$|Every known type of {{eruption}} (Hawaiian, Strombolian, <b>Plinian,</b> subplinian, phreatic, phreatomagmatic, and Vulcanian) {{has occurred}} {{at some point}} in the range. Cerro Azul itself has experienced phreatic, Strombolian, and <b>Plinian</b> activity in human history. The type of eruption tends to correspond with lava composition. Strombolian eruptions at Llaima, Antuco, Villarrica, and elsewhere have been produced by basaltic to basaltic–andesitic activity. Dacitic to rhyolitic lavas have been linked to subplinian and <b>Plinian</b> eruptions, such as those at Quizapu (1932) and Hudson (1991). Because of this variability, volcanic hazards from Cerro Azul and the surrounding region could come in many different forms. Historical eruptions typically have produced lahars, lava flows, and ashfalls. Lava flows and lahars could wipe out entire cities or towns. Ashfall produced by explosive eruptions could interfere with air traffic. Most threatening of all is the risk of pyroclastic flows or avalanches, which have historically traversed as far as [...] in the region.|$|E
500|$|Pyroclastic flow {{deposits}} {{generated by}} Ciomadul {{have been found}} on its northeastern, southern and western slopes. They reach a distance {{of as much as}} [...] from the volcano. At Tusnad road, one of the flows has a thickness of [...] Tephra fall bed, lapilli, and surge deposits are also found, and the flow deposits contain pumice blocks. One lapilli layer, [...] thick, from Ciomadul has been identified [...] east of the volcano. The whole pyroclastic formation has been subdivided into three classes known as [...] "Early Phreatomagmatic + <b>Plinian</b> Activity", [...] "Middle <b>Plinian</b> Activity" [...] and [...] "Latest St. Ana Phreatomagmatic Activity". Each comprise a number of individual tephra layers.|$|E
500|$|The <b>Plinian</b> {{eruption}} {{resulted in}} an estimated [...] high ash plume which extended into the stratosphere. In addition, the magma underlying the volcano {{came into contact with}} the shallow marine embayment, resulting in a violent steam eruption.|$|E
500|$|Regions {{affected}} by <b>Plinian</b> eruptions {{are subjected to}} heavy pumice airfall affecting an area [...] in size. The material in the ash plume eventually finds its {{way back to the}} ground, covering the landscape in a thick layer of many cubic kilometers of ash.|$|E
