40|$|Dysregulated CD 44 {{expression}} is {{a feature of}} most human cancers, including prostate cancer (PCa). PCa loses expression of CD 44 standard (CD 44 s) which is present in benign epithelium, and overexpresses a novel splice variant isoform, CD 44 v 7 - 10, specifically facilitating fibronectin binding and invasion. Naturally-occurring or synthetic <b>phenyl-methylene</b> hydantoin (PMH) and S-ethyl PMH (S-PMH) can reportedly augment cell-cell adhesion, and reduce invasion and growth of PCa. Benign BPH- 1 and malignant PC- 3 M prostate cells were treated with PMH or S-PMH for 36 h and cells were harvested. Cell adhesion assays were carried out. Cancer cells’ expression of total CD 44 and CD 44 v 7 - 10 were tested by western blot analysis and real-time RT-PCR. Compared to BPH- 1 or PC- 3 M cells treated with vehicle only, PMH-or S-PMH-treated benign and malignant cells had decreased adhesion to hyaluronan (p= 0. 001 to 0. 007) and fibronectin (p< 0. 001 to 0. 047). Both compounds decreased PCa expression of CD 44 total mRNA (representing mostly CD 44 s, to 0. 076 ± 0. 033 and 0. 254 ± 0. 123 of control) and CD 44 v 7 - 10 (to 0. 386 ± 0. 279 and 0. 115 ± 0. 037 of control). S-PMH but not PMH decreased CD 44 total protein, while both decreased CD 44 v 7 - 10 protein. Both hydantoins lowered β-catenin, as reported previously. Both only slightly decreased β 1 -integrin, the definitive receptor for fibronectin. In conclusion, the ability of PMH and S-PMH to decrease hyaluronan adhesion appears to be mediated through decreased CD 44 s, while the decrease in fibronectin adhesion correlates with, and may be mediated by, decreased CD 44 v 7 - 10...|$|E
40|$|CD 44 is a cell {{adhesion}} glycoprotein that also governs cell signaling. Dysregulated CD 44 expression characterizes most human cancers, including prostate cancer (PCa). PCa loses expression of CD 44 standard (CD 44 s) that {{is present in}} benign epithelium, and overexpresses the novel splice variant (v) isoform, CD 44 v 7 - 10. We studied CD 44 in PCa {{for more than a}} decade, and in a series of papers, established its functional significance. Using retrovi-ral gene delivery to PC- 3 M PCa cells, we expressed luciferase-only, enforced CD 44 s re-expression as a fusion protein with luciferase at its C-terminus or as a protein separate from luciferase, or knocked down CD 44 v 7 - 10 by RNAi. Invasion, migration, proliferation, soft agar colony formation, adhesion, Docetaxel sensitivity, and xenograft growth assays were carried out. Compared to luciferase-only PC- 3 M cells, all 3 treatments reduced invasion and migration. Growth and soft agar colony formation were reduced only by re-expression of CD 44 s as a separate or fusion protein but not CD 44 v 7 - 10 RNAi. Hyaluronan and osteopontin binding were greatly strengthened by CD 44 s expression as a separate protein, but not a fusion protein. CD 44 v 7 - 10 RNAi in PC- 3 M cells caused marked sensitization to Docetaxel; the 2 CD 44 s re-expression approaches caused minimal sensitization. In limited numbers of mouse subcutaneous xeno-grafts, all 3 alterations produced only nonsignificant trends toward slower growth compared with luciferase-only controls. In further work, we tested the effects of the anti-growth compound silibinin, a milk thistle derivative. Using a luciferase promoter construct to test for CD 44 promoter activity, silibinin significantly and dose-dependently inhibited promoter activity at physiologic doses. Total CD 44 RNA and CD 44 v 7 - 10 RNA were significantly decreased; both were also decreased at the protein level. <b>Phenyl-methylene</b> hydantoins (PMH), guanidine alkaloids derived from Red Sea sponges, have the ability to increase cell-{{cell adhesion}} in prostate cancer cells and reduce invasion. Expression of CD 44 total mRNA and CD 44 v 7 - 10 were markedly decreased by PMH and its S-ethyl derivative. The oncogenic mi-croRNAs, miR- 373 and miR- 520 c, which interact with CD 44, were studied in prostate cancer cells and human tissues. We found that they bound the 3 ’ untranslated region of the CD 44 RNA, and suppressed CD 44 in prostate cancer, by preventing the translation of CD 44 RNA, rather than by degrading the RNA. Thus, stable re-expression of CD 44 s reduces PCa growth and invasion in vitro, and possibly in vivo, suggesting CD 44 's potential as gene therapy. Finally, CD 44 v 7 - 10 may be a target for chemosensitization, and plays a role in nutraceutical abrogation of tumor development. In vivo effects of CD 44 alteration still need to be investigated by use of orthotopic or renal capsule xenografts, which confer a different stromal microenvironment than that of the subcutaneous grafts...|$|E
