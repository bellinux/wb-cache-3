40|$|Future {{reusable}} launch {{vehicles will}} require advanced structural seals. This includes propulsion seals along edges and hinge lines in hypersonic engines, and control surface seals for movable flaps and elevons on proposed reentry vehicles. Seals must remain in sealing engagement with opposing surfaces, for multiple missions, {{even though the}} seal gap may be opening and closing due to thermal and structural loads. To meet this requirement either the seals themselves must be resilient or {{there must be a}} resilient structural element behind the seals. Case Western Reserve University is working with NASA s Glenn Research Center to develop more resilient high temperature seal components and preloading devices. Results are presented for a finite element analysis of a canted coil spring that is being considered as a high temperature seal <b>preloading</b> <b>device.</b> This type of spring is a leading candidate due to its ability to provide nearly constant force over a large deflection. The finite element analyses were verified by comparing them to experimental results of canted coil springs of three different stiffnesses, measured at Glenn Research Center. Once validated the parameterized model was combined with a scripting algorithm to assess the effects of key spring design variables (wire diameter, coils per inch, cant amplitude, eccentricity, and spring width) on spring stiffness and maximum Von Mises stress to aid in subsequent design...|$|E

40|$|High temperature, dynamic {{structural}} seals {{are required}} in advanced hypersonic engines {{to seal the}} perimeters of movable engine ramps for efficient, safe operation in high heat flux environments at temperatures from 2000 to 2500 F. NASA GRC {{became involved in the}} development of high temperature structural seals in the late 1980 s and early 1990 s during the National Aerospace Plane (NASP) program. Researchers at GRC carried out an in-house program to develop seals for the NASP hypersonic engine and oversaw industry efforts for airframe and propulsion system seal development for this vehicle. The figure shows one of the seal locations in the NASP engine. Seals were needed along the edges of movable panels in the engine to seal gaps between the panels and adjacent engine sidewalls. Seals developed during the NASP program met many requirements but fell short of leakage, durability, and resiliency goals. Due to program termination the seals could not be adequately matured.

40|$|Purpose of {{the review}} An {{adequate}} cardiac preload is essential {{in the treatment of}} critically ill patients. During anesthesia for thoracic surgery, volume and vasoactive therapy to optimize cardiac output, oxygen delivery (tissue perfusion) and to avoid pulmonary edema is a central therapeutic aspect. Cardiac preload has been estimated with different techniques in clinical practice, even though studies performed on thoracic anesthesia are lacking. Recent findings We analyze the conventional pulmonary artery catheter, transesophageal echocardiography and the transpulmonary indicator dilution technique as <b>preload</b> monitoring <b>devices</b> with their indications and limits in thoracic anesthesia. Summary The pulmonary artery catheter is confirmed as a fundamental device particularly in patients with pulmonary hypertension. For transesophageal echocardiography monitoring, the dependency on operator experience, the low repeatability and the high costs limit its interpretation and diffusion in clinical practice. During lung transplantation, Swan Ganz catheter monitoring is recommended. The optimization of fluid balance and vasoactive drug administration based on volumetric monitoring makes the transpulmonary indicator dilution technique a new option as an effective monitoring system during anesthesia for thoracic surgery when intravascular volume management is a primary objective...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWhen {{laminated}} {{composite materials}} in modern aircraft structures {{are subject to}} impact loads, they are typically not unloaded but under a certain state of prestress. Therefore, in this study {{the effect of a}} compressive preload on the low velocity impact behaviour of three different carbon fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) materials is investigated. An experimental test programme is documented first, including the design of a <b>preload</b> test <b>device,</b> the specimen manufacture and the results description.

Non-destructive inspections showed a large extent of delaminations occurring between individual plies, being an important energy absorption mechanism. The development of numerical simulation methods for this impact scenario using the commercial explicit finite element code LS-DYNA is described in detail. The focus is on the composite material, delamination and preload modelling.

40|$|All rotary blood pumps (RBPs) {{are prone}} to {{the harmful effects of}} {{ventricular}} collapse or "suction events" because of over-pumping, because they are inherently <b>preload</b> insensitive <b>devices,</b> yet RBP controllers do not comprise a clinically reliable suction detector. We therefore investigated the clinical performance of seven expertly selected time domain indices of suction based on the observed positive spike induced in the RBP impeller speed waveform. Using expert panel classifications, a balanced set of 404 five-second speed snapshots of normal and suction events was created from the impeller speed 25 Hz data in 12 VentrAssist implant patients. Initially, suction index threshold levels were set differently for each patient, giving best sensitivity 95 % and specificity 99 %. However, analysis of paired combinations of suction indices with fixed thresholds identified one pair giving an acceptable sensitivity of 99. 5 % and specificity 97. 5 %; the low number of high speed data samples relative to the speed snapshot mean and maximum OR the largest increase in successive speed maxima. The additional precondition of RBP speed amplitude exceeding a low threshold level allows its more general application to patients with low cardiac contractility. This gives a suction detector with high clinical utility; requiring three index threshold settings only. (C) 2008 Amercian Society of Artificial Internal Organ...|$|R
