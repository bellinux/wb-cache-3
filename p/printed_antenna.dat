50|$|The {{advantages}} of the Fresnel zoneplate antenna are numerous. It is normally cheap to manufacture and install, easy to transport and package and can achieve high gain. Owing to its flat nature, the wind loading force of a Fresnel zoneplate can {{be as little as}} 1/8 of that of conventional solid or wire-meshed reflectors of similar size.

5000|$|In telecommunication, a {{microstrip}} antenna (also {{known as a}} <b>printed</b> <b>antenna)</b> usually means an antenna fabricated using microstrip techniques on {{a printed circuit board}} (PCB). [...] They are mostly used at microwave frequencies. An individual {{microstrip antenna}} consists of a patch of metal foil of various shapes (a patch antenna) on the surface of a PCB, with a metal foil ground plane {{on the other side of}} the board. Most microstrip antennas consist of multiple patches in a two-dimensional array. The antenna is usually connected to the transmitter or receiver through foil microstrip transmission lines. The radio frequency current is applied (or in receiving antennas the received signal is produced) between the antenna and ground plane. Microstrip antennas have become very popular in recent decades due to their thin planar profile which can be incorporated into the surfaces of consumer products, aircraft and missiles; their ease of fabrication using printed circuit techniques; the ease of integrating the antenna on the same board with the rest of the circuit, and the possibility of adding active devices such as microwave integrated circuits to the antenna itself to make active antennas.|$|E

Generally, the efficiency of power transferring through <b>printed</b> <b>antennas</b> is less than conventional coils because of some characteristics of conductive inks and printing processes.

Three layouts for screen <b>printing</b> of the <b>antennas</b> were represented: Preliminary layout for practical tests on fine line printing and dimensional characteristics of antennas; Comparative layout for comparison between electromagnetic characteristics of antennas; and a Final layout for using in wireless powering. Two types of mesh screens and three types of conductive silver inks were applied for printing the samples on PET substrates. Characterization of printed samples was done by application of a network analyzer based on reflection method in frequency range of 100 Hz to 40 MHz. The magnitude and phase angle of impedance spectrum were plotted and the inductance, resistance, and parasitic capacitance were calculated based on equivalent RLC model. The first resonance frequency of most of antennas was included in the frequency range of measurement. The phase angle did not exceed 90 ° in all of the samples. The resonance frequency improved extremely by increasing the track width and decreasing the number of turns. Application of different inks could significantly change the impedance value. The measurements showed that the proximity effect losses could be more effective than skin effect in printed samples. Also, by increasing the track length or turn numbers, the parasitic capacitance and inductance could be increased.
