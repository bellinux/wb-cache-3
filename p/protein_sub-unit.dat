The combination of Protective Antigen (PA) and Lethal Factor (LF) forming Lethal Toxin (LT), acts within host cells to down-regulate the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade. Until recently the MAPK kinases were the only known substrate for LT; {{over the past few}} years it has become evident that LT also cleaves Nlrp 1, leading to inflammasome activation and macrophage death. The predicted downstream consequences of subverting these important cellular pathways are impaired antigen presentation and adaptive immunity. In contrast to this, recent work has indicated that robust memory T cell responses to B. anthracis antigens can be identified following natural anthrax infection.

However, for many infectious diseases T cells {{are an important part of}} naturally acquired protective immune responses, and inducing these by vaccination has been the aim of much research. The progress that has been made in developing effective T-cell-inducing vaccines against viral and parasitic diseases such as HIV and malaria is discussed, along with recent developments in therapeutic vaccine development for chronic viral infections and cancer. Although many ways of inducing T cells by vaccination have been assessed, the majority result in low level, non-protective responses. Sufficient clinical research has now been conducted to establish that replication-deficient viral vectored vaccines lead the field in inducing strong and broad responses, and efficacy studies of T-cell-inducing vaccines against a number of diseases are finally demonstrating that this is a valid approach to filling the gaps in our defence against not only infectious disease, but some forms of cancer. © 2011 The Author.

Disease control strategies rely upon chemotherapy, however, sustainability is questionable due {{to issues of}} chemical residues, eco-toxicity and acaricide resistance. Control by vaccination is supported by demonstration of protective immunity in sheep previously infested with P. ovis. We identified vaccine candidates for P. ovis based on: (1) antigens selected by their interaction with host signalling pathways and the host immune-response; and (2) those shown to be either immunogenic or involved in mite feeding. This resulted {{in the development and}} validation, in repeated immunisation and challenge trials, of a seven recombinant <b>protein</b> <b>sub-unit</b> cocktail vaccine. Sheep were inoculated on three occasions, 2  weeks apart, along with QuilA adjuvant. Vaccination resulted in highly significant reductions in both lesion size (up to 63 %) and mite numbers (up to 56 %) following challenge. Mean lesion size in vaccinates was significantly smaller than controls from 1  week post infestation (wpi) {{until the end of the}} experiment at 6 wpi. All antigens elicited serum IgG responses following immunisation and prior to infestation, whereas controls did not produce antigen-specific IgG during the pre-infestation period. Vaccinated animals showed an amnestic response, with levels of antigen-specific IgG against muGST, Pso o 1 and Pso o 2 increasing following infestation.

40|$|Vaccines {{have already}} made a {{significant}} impact on global healthcare with the eradication or reduction in disease states; however, further work is required to develop ‘safer’ vaccines by the use of sub-unit antigens. When considering immunisation, whilst the oral route is the most convenient route for drug and vaccine administration, most vaccines are still delivered via an injection. To be able to be given orally, vaccine antigens need to be associated with carrier systems to both protect the antigen from degradation within the harsh gut environment and to improve uptake by appropriate target sites, namely M cells located in the Peyer’s patches, which are responsible for secretory IgA and other mucosal responses. Therefore, niosomes have been considered within this thesis to enhance the protection and delivery of sub-unit vaccines via the oral route and intramuscularly. Initial work included using Design of Experiments to optimise niosome/ bilosome vesicles prepared from of Monopalmitoyl glycerol (MPG), Synthecol (Chol), Dicetyl Phosphate (DCP) and bile salt in terms of their vesicle size, surface charge, suspension pH and antigen loading. Optimisation studies, demonstrated that the ideal composition was a 5 : 4 : 1 ratio of MPG:Chol:DCP respectively. Langmuir balance and differential scanning calorimetry studies also demonstrated that, cholesterol inserts between the lipids within the bilayer hence, preventing crystallisation of the hydrophobic tails of the other surfactants. Using the optimised niosome formulation, oral biodistribution of these niosomes (3 H) and the H 3 N 2 (125 I) antigen showed that of the dose administered (t= 1 h), significantly (p< 0. 05) higher antigen (59. 8 %) was recovered within all organs of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) when formulated with niosome vesicles compared to the free antigen (38 %). Uptake at the target site of the Peyer’s patches revealed that on average 1. 4 % antigen was present within the Peyer’s patches when associated with the niosome vesicles compared to the free antigen dose which demonstrated only 0. 4 % antigen was acquired within the Peyer’s patches. Furthermore, uptake within the mesenteric lymph tissues demonstrated 0. 7 % antigen recovery when associated with niosomes compared to 0. 2 % recovery of the free antigen dose. Hence, uptake studies demonstrated that niosome associated antigen show a 2 -fold improved uptake and retention at the target sites compared to administering the free antigen alone. Reduction in vesicle size of the niosomal systems to 2 μm made no significant difference in recovery of either the vesicles or associated antigen in the mesenteric lymph tissue. However, when comparing the Peyer’s patches, whilst {{there was no significant difference}} in localisation of antigen, there was a greater recovery of vesicles within the Peyer's patches of the larger 6 μm vesicles (p< 0. 05) in comparison to the 2 μm vesicle formulation, which is an indicator of achieving increased mucosal immunity. Within ferrets, the optimised niosomes containing bile salts were shown to lower median temperature differential change and show inflammatory cell counts in nasal washes to be comparable to the commercial vaccine administered intramuscularly after challenge with a clinical H 1 N 1 isolate. In terms of intramuscular administration, niosomes incorporating H 1 N 1 and H 3 N 2 antigen provided thermostability when stored at elevated temperatures for 3 months at 40 °C confirmed by HAI and ELISA studies when compared to the commercial vaccine. In addition, the association of antigen confirmed the dose sparing ability of niosome preparations to elicit immune responses comparable to the control vaccine doses. In conclusion, this thesis demonstrates that niosomes can be used as delivery systems for peptides and <b>protein</b> <b>sub-unit</b> antigens by providing antigen protection thereby, enhancing vaccine efficacy when administered orally and intramuscularly...|$|E

40|$|The {{object of}} the work {{described}} in this thesis {{was to investigate the}} attachment, and penetration of the host cell walls and membranes by the minute bacteriophage andPhi;X 174. In an attempt to simplify the investigation, the interaction between viral particles and cell walls isolated from the bacterial host, Escherichia coli strain C, was examined. Conditions for maximum, irreversible adsorption to cell walls were shown to be in buffered solutions at pH 6 andndash; 9, at 35 andndash; 45 anddeg;, in the presence of calcium or magnesium ions. It was established that these conditions gave efficient attachment to intact bacteria. When phage particles labelled with 32 P-phosphate became attached to isolated bacterial cell walls, up to 30 % of the viral 32 P was converted to a form accessible to the enzyme, pancreatic deoxyribonuclease (DNase). This indicated that some of the phage deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was released on attachment of virus to cell walls. At the same time, some of the adsorbed andPhi;X 174 virus were converted to particles which could be eluted from the cell walls by a solution of sodium borate, containing ethylene diamine tetra acetate (EDTA). The particles were resolved into two components on fractionation by sedimentation through sucrose density gradients. One component consisted of particles with a sedimentation coefficient of 45 - 50 S (50 S particles). When viral preparations, doubly labelled with 32 P- and 35 S- were used, comparison {{of the value of the}} 35 S/ 32 P ratio in the original phage and in the 50 S particles, showed that the latter contained the same quantity of DNA as the original virus. In contrast to intact virus, however, the 50 S particles were infectious towards bacterial spheroplasts, but not towards whole bacteria. Examination in the electron microscope of 50 S particles, isolated by sedimentation through sucrose gradients, failed to reveal any gross contamination with cell wall or other material, which might have caused anomalous sedimentation behaviour. It was concluded that a conformational change in the arrangement of the viral <b>protein</b> <b>sub-units</b> occurred on attachment to the cell walls and was responsible for the changes in infectivity and sedimentation coefficient. Similar investigations on the second component, showed that it had a sedimentation coefficient of 70, was not infectious towards whole bacteria or spheroplasts, and handd a reduced DNA complement. The particles appeared to be identical with the "top component" previously identified by others in preparations of andPhi;X 174 (e. g. Sinsheirner R. L., (1959) J. Mol. Biol. 1 : 37). Attachment of andPhi;X 174 to intact, starved bacteria suspended in buffer also resulted in the formation of 50 S and 70 S particles, which were eluted from the bacteria by sodium borate and EDTA. After prolonged incubation (30 minutes) of virus with either cell walls, or intact bacteria, only the 70 S component could be detected in eluates made with borate-EDTA solution. When the viral material eluted from cell walls was treated with DNase there was no loss in infectivity detectable in the bacterial spheroplast assay. It was concluded that all of the infectivity resided in the 50 S component, and none in the viral DNA released on attachment of the phage particles. The results show that changes occur in andPhi;X 174 particles when these attach to isolated cell walls or to non-metabolising bacteria. The possible role of the 50 S component in the natural infectious process could not be determined from the experiments described here. Its properties suggest that it contains a hitherto unrecognised particle which can be formed by conformational changes in whole intact andPhi;X 174. </p...|$|R

For this reason, novel DENV candidate vaccines are being developed with the goal of achieving a protective immune response with an immunization schedule that can be given {{over the course of a}} few months. These next-generation candidates include DNA vaccines, recombinant adenovirus vectored vaccines, alphavirus replicons, and <b>sub-unit</b> <b>protein</b> vaccines. Several of these novel candidates will be discussed...|$|R

The cellular oscillators synchronize each other via paracrine or systemic communications, resulting in rhythmic changes of tis-sue- and whole body-level physiologies and behaviors. Circadian regulation of metabolism is well documented and disruption of such temporal regulation is known to predispose organisms to metabolic diseases. However, the under-lying mechanism of circadian regulation of metabolism is complex and incom-pletely understood. The research has mainly focused on the transcriptional mechanisms by which circadian clock components regulate metabolic gene expression. A recent paper by Zhang et al. in Nature Medicine [1] {{for the first time}} elucidated a non-nuclear role of a circadian clock protein CRYPTO-CHROME (CRY) in mice; CRY regu-lates the circadian changes of hepatic gluconeogenesis, possibly through the interaction with a G <b>protein,</b> Gs α <b>sub-unit,</b> which leads to temporal regulation of glucagon signaling triggering CREB phosphorylation (Figure 1). The circadian oscillator is based on transcriptional mechanisms in which the BMAL 1 and CLOCK (or NPAS 2) transcription factor heterodimer binds to the cis-acting E-box elements in Period (Per 1 -Per 3) and Cryptochrome (Cry 1 and Cry 2) genes and drive thei...|$|R
40|$|Vaccines {{remain a}} key {{tool in the}} defence against major diseases. However, in the {{development}} of vaccines a trade off between safety and efficacy is required with newer vaccines, based on <b>sub-unit</b> <b>proteins</b> and peptides, displaying improved safety profiles yet suffering from low efficacy. Adjuvants can be employed to improve their potency, but currently there are {{only a limited number of}} adjuvant systems licensed for clinical use. Of the new adjuvants being investigated, particulate systems offer several advantages including: passive targeting to the antigen-presenting cells within the immune system, protection against adjuvant degradation, and ability for sustained antigen release. There has been a range of particulate vaccine delivery systems outlined in recent patents including polymer-based microspheres (which are generally more focused on the use of synthetic polymers, in particular the polyesters) and surfactant-based vesicles. Within these formulations, several patented systems are exploiting the use of cationic lipids which, despite their limitations in gene therapy, clearly offer strong potential as adjuvants. Within this review, the current range of particulate system technologies being investigated as potential adjuvants are discussed with regard to both their respective advantages and the potential hurdles which must be overcome for such systems to be converted into successful pharmaceutical products...|$|R
40|$|Bovine {{immunodeficiency}} virus (BIV) is a bovine lentivirus that infects animals world-wide. The authors have cloned the BIV env and gag <b>proteins</b> and several <b>sub-unit</b> peptides spanning the entire coding {{regions of the}} two proteins as fusions to the bacterial trpE protein and expressed them in Escherichia coli (Spindler et al. 1984). These recombinant proteins can readily be expressed but the expression levels of these peptides varied. When these proteins were tested against a panel of bovine sera, only sera from BIV-infected animals reacted specifically. One major antigenic determinant was identified in the cartoxyl terminus of the p 26 gag protein and another was identified in the transmembrane (TM) domain of the envelope glycoprotein. The pathogenesis of the BIV infection has not been well characterized. Experimentally-infected animals did not develop immunodeficiency. It is possible that co-factors {{may play a role}} in enhancing the pathogenesis of BIV infection; and one of these co-factors could be bovine herpesviruses (BHV). BHV- 1 co-infection of BIV-infected cells enhanced BIV replication and an immediate early gene of BHV- 1 is involved. This herpes-viral gene product acts on the BIV promotor element to stimulate BIV expression. In vivo co-infection of animals with BIV and BIV- 1 demonstrated that these viruses can interact in vivo, with BHV-l reactivated BIV expression in infected animals...|$|R
40|$|The {{microbial}} degradation of isothiazolin rings was investigated. A mixed culture of bacteria able to utilise the isothiazolin ring containing compound saccharin {{as a source}} of carbon and nitrogen was isolated. A single type of bacterium able to utilise saccharin {{as a source of}} nitrogen was isolated from the community and identified as an Alcaligenes sp. A second organism able to utilise benzoate as a carbon source was isolated and identified as a Pseudomonas sp. Together the two bacteria were able to utilise saccharin as a source of carbon and nitrogen. The end products ammonia, sulphite, sulphate and catechol were detected during utilisation of saccharin by the Alcaligenes sp. When the Alcaligenes sp. and the Pseudomonas sp. grew in co-culture utilising saccharin as the carbon and nitrogen source the end products ammonia, sulphite and sulphate were detected.;To investigate the cleavage of sulphur-nitrogen bonds sulphamate was used as a nitrogen source for the growth of bacteria. A single type of bacterium was isolated and identified as a Mycobacterium sp. A protein, termed sulphamate hydrolase, was isolated which was able to hydrolyse sulphamate to yield sulphate and ammonia. The <b>protein</b> had a <b>sub-unit</b> molecular mass of 50. 8 kDa and a native molecular mass of 286 kDa. Based on this information the protein was presumed to be a hexamer composed of identical sub-units. A relatively high Km value of 26 mM and a low catalytic efficiency value of 413 M- 1. s- 1 was found which suggests that the enzyme is not ideally suited to the hydrolysis of sulphamate...|$|R
