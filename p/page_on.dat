40|$|This paper {{presents}} an {{implementation of a}} P 2 P Web Browser, called Web 2 Peer 1, for publishing web <b>pages</b> <b>on</b> internet through peer-to-peer networks.

The proposed solution allows anyone who has a computer connected to the Internet, even through domestic ADSL connection, to publish web <b>pages</b> <b>on</b> their own machines. By using a peer-to-peer web browser another mechanism for searching web pages is offered based on DHT (Distributed Hash Tables). The user interface, provided by Web 2 Peer, carries all functions needed for creating, editing, publishing, searching, downloading and replicating the web <b>pages</b> <b>on</b> the peer-to-peer network...|$|R

5|$|His {{conception}} of 'marvellous reality' {{revolves around the}} natural fantastic qualities of Latin America and the Caribbean, {{as opposed to the}} overly forced and cliché efforts by European surrealists to portray magical occurrences. The result was the presentation of impossible or fantastic events described as if they were completely usual and natural, such as the metamorphoses of Mackandal and Ti Noel. These events, however, often represent the beliefs of other characters in the novel.
