50|$|In 1929, Powel Crosley Jr. built a Florida winter retreat on Sarasota Bay for his wife, Gwendolyn. The retreat {{was built}} along the bay {{front of a}} 63 acre parcel that was platted in 1925 as a {{subdivision}} named Sea Gate. According to official county documents and grandson Lewis L. Crosley's birth certificate, the name was spelled on these early documents as two words, Sea Gate, but has become contracted in use over the years, including {{the name of the}} street (the original driveway) leading to the building, which was renamed as, Seagate Drive, by the county. Platted as part of Hillsborough County when Florida was surveyed following acquisition by the United States, this land always has been associated culturally with Sarasota because of it being south of the natural land transportation barrier, Bowlees Creek. Seagate bears a <b>property</b> <b>address</b> and a postal designation of Sarasota for this reason, however, when Hillsborough became subdivided the governmental oversight went to the new Manatee County, which later was subdivided as well to create other counties including the new Sarasota County in 1921. The arbitrary line chosen to delineate the new county line during the last change was drawn at the southern boundary of Seagate and everything to the north remained within Manatee County. Sarasota addresses remain from that line to the creek.|$|E

40|$|This work {{represents}} the personal {{views of the}} author rather than those of HUD and/or {{the government of the}} United States. A number of the examples used in this work have been modified to protect individual privacy and/or to simplify the exposition. In particular, none of the borrower names and addresses is intended to represent those of actual FHAinsured mortgages. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insures mortgages against the risk of foreclosure. Since its inception in 1934, FHA has insured over 37 million mortgages on single-family homes. This requires FHA to store data on a large number of mortgages. Because of the large number of mergers/acquisitions among mortgage lenders, it is sometimes difficult for the surviving lenders to maintain accurate databases. As a consequence, such lenders do not always transmit accurate/timely data to FHA on the termination of FHA-insured single-family mortgages that they are servicing. This, in turn, means that FHA’s database has many mortgages listed as “active ” that have in fact been terminated. In addition, FHA made a decision many years ago to omit the <b>property</b> <b>address</b> of insured mortgages from its databases on single-family mortgages because of the high cost of computer storage at that time. Although this decision was later reversed as such costs declined, even in the year 2008, FHA had a substantial number of “active ” mortgage records without a corresponding <b>property</b> <b>address...</b>|$|E

40|$|As {{part of the}} Road Home program, homeowners {{were given}} an option to rebuild instead of turning their {{property}} over to the Louisiana Land Trust. Owners of Option 1 properties were given up to $ 150, 000 towards rehabilitation or replacement post Hurricane Katrina in 2005. This paper provides an update to the initial study that was conducted in the Summer 2010 to evaluate the status of Road Home Option 1 properties. The property has an attached covenant that required rehabilitation within 3 years of fund receipt. There have been concerns that these homes have not met this legal requirement and may become future blight or turned into Option 2 / 3 homes that must be managed then sold by the State. While Louisiana Land Trust administration has used proxies for rehabilation (such as US postal receipt or Electrical usage), an on-the-ground parcel study has not been completed on over the 30, 000 properties throughout the City of New Orleans, LA. This paper describes the process to develop a unique dataset prior to site analysis to evaluate {{a sample of the}} Option 1 properties citywide. Converting the static <b>property</b> <b>address</b> data and matching this to the City parcel data allowed advanced GIS network analysis to identify the properties then conduct site visits.

A noção de propriedade aparece aqui relacionada de forma íntima com aspectos cosmológicos do candomblé e se traduz em relações sociais mediadas por categorias como clientela religiosa, ajuda, família de santo e axé. O material etnográfico está organizado sob a forma de cenas sociais, segundo a proposição de F. Weber (2001). As cenas sociais que iluminam a discussão sobre a propriedade abordam questões que envolvem a posse de objetos e a propriedade sobre os terrenos onde são instalados os candomblés.

NYC Geoclient API, developed by NYC DOITT, {{was used in}} a script to geocode locations of the properties sold.

40|$|The new {{geocoding}} toolkit (matching a {{crime to}} the geographic location where it occurred) has been developed {{in order to improve}} the "hit" rate (rate at which a batch of crimes can be accurately located on a map). The purpose of the toolkit is not to replace commercial address-matching software such as Matchcode or QAS, but to enhance the outcome of the geocoding process by building additional steps and tools around these existing software products. It is a five-stage process. The first stage cleans common errors that arise in the address fields of crime data. In the second stage, the crime data are passed through commercial address-matching software, which attaches geographic coordinates to the crime location based on a street address. All addresses successfully geocoded at this stage are given the validation code "L 1," indicating that the crime has been linked to an individual <b>property</b> <b>address</b> at the highest level of accuracy. The third stage focuses on crimes with nonaddress locations. The majority of these are street junctions and {{can be found in the}} free-text data field that describes the venue of the crime incident. Other nonaddress locations would include railway stations, bus stations, and prominent landmarks. The junctions are text-mined by searching for key words. In the fourth stage, all remaining records with a valid unit postcode (mail delivery point) are geocoded at the postcode level. The final stage of the toolkit geocodes all remaining records according to street name. A test of this system in a British police force raised the "hit" rate for accurate crime location an additional 65 percent to a rate of 91 percent...|$|E

Early in 2012 the Rural <b>Property</b> <b>Addressing</b> Project in South Australia announced that it had substantially met its outcomes, and that the whole of the project was soon to be completed. In 2003, one of the recommendations to cabinet from the South Australian Premier's Bushfire Summit was to endorse the development of a standard <b>property</b> <b>addressing</b> system for rural properties across the state. This was formally endorsed by cabinet, and was a direct response to the fact that essential services such as ambulance, medical and social care were hindered in providing services to the residents of Eyre Peninsula during and after the bushfires. Overall, this was not a controversial decision, nor was it a huge implementation challenge, yet it took nine years to come into effect. This is a classic case of the tyranny of small decisions. This article outlines some of the implementation challenges faced by this apparently simple project, and provides some thoughts for implementation challenges of the future. The take-away message is that if something so comparatively simple was made so complex, how can we adapt our public services to the cross-cutting challenges of the future...|$|R
