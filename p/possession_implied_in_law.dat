50|$|Contracts <b>implied</b> <b>in</b> <b>law</b> {{differ from}} {{contracts}} <b>implied</b> <b>in</b> fact <b>in</b> that contracts <b>implied</b> <b>in</b> <b>law</b> {{are not true}} contracts. Contracts <b>implied</b> <b>in</b> fact are ones that the parties involved presumably intended. <b>In</b> contracts <b>implied</b> <b>in</b> <b>law,</b> one party may have been completely unwilling to participate, as shown below, especially for an action in restitution. There has been no mutual assent, in other words, but public policy essentially requires a remedy.|$|R
50|$|The terms {{quasi-contract}} {{and contract}} <b>implied</b> <b>in</b> <b>law</b> are synonymous. There {{are two types}} of quasi-contract. One is an action in restitution. The other is unjust enrichment. Note, therefore, that it is improper to say that quasi-contract, <b>implied</b> <b>in</b> <b>law</b> contract, and unjust enrichment are all synonymous, because unjust enrichment is only one type of the broader category of quasi-contracts (contracts <b>implied</b> <b>in</b> <b>law).</b>|$|R
50|$|A term <b>implied</b> <b>in</b> <b>law</b> (a naturale) is {{one that}} the <b>law,</b> <b>in</b> the absence of {{agreement}} to the contrary by the parties, and in some cases compulsorily, attaches to the particular class of contract. Many of the terms of performance or obligations of the parties in contracts such as sale, letting and hiring, or agency, are <b>implied</b> <b>in</b> <b>law.</b> For example, suppose that the owner of a grandstand lets a seat on it to a spectator for a certain day. The former is under an obligation to keep the stand in a proper state of repair, a term to that effect being <b>implied</b> <b>in</b> <b>law</b> <b>in</b> all contracts of letting and hiring of property.|$|R
50|$|Terms <b>implied</b> <b>in</b> <b>law</b> are terms {{automatically}} <b>implied</b> <b>in</b> contracts of {{a particular}} class or description deriving from legal principles rather than {{the intentions of the}} parties to the contract.For a term to be <b>implied</b> <b>in</b> <b>law,</b> the relevant test is whether the omission of the term would significantly diminish the rights of the parties under contract. This has been referred to as the test of necessity, which has been differentiated from the business efficacy test conducted in the implication of terms in fact, due to the former test taking into regard considerations of policy, and among other things such as the nature of the contract, and justice and policy.|$|R

[...] In addition, Hemingway struggled with writing in novel form; viewing In Our Time as a novel would mean that he struggled after he had already succeeded. [...] Finally, cutting “On Writing” gave Nick greater flexibility as a character. Assigning him authorship to all of In Our Time would force him to take on more and more stories, but without the <b>possession</b> <b>implied</b> <b>in</b> the fragment, Nick was free to appear in any of Hemingway’s future stories—but only if he chose.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> civil <b>law</b> jurisdictions, a {{nominate}} {{contract is}} a standardized contractual relationship {{that has a}} special designation attached to it (e.g., purchase and sale, lease, loan, insurance), as opposed to innominate contracts (which are not standardized and therefore have no set name). The obligor and obligee have rights and obligations specially prescribed by law. Nominate contracts are usually statutorily required to include certain express terms (essentialia)—depending on their kind—and are construed to include terms <b>implied</b> <b>in</b> <b>law.</b>|$|R

25|$|In certain circumstances, {{an implied}} {{contract}} may be created. A contract is <b>implied</b> <b>in</b> fact if the circumstances imply that parties have {{reached an agreement}} {{even though they have}} not done so expressly.

A contract which is <b>implied</b> <b>in</b> <b>law</b> is also called a quasi-contract, because it is not in fact a contract; rather, it is a means for the courts to remedy situations in which one party would be unjustly enriched were he or she not required to compensate the other.

40|$|Allometry {{is crucial}} in biology; scaling {{relations}} are <b>implied</b> <b>in</b> <b>laws</b> of growth of living systems. The self similarity of Gompertzian growths of biological organisms plays a key role, in this regard, in biological similitude.

But, besides biology, scaling and growth characterize many different complex systems. Encompassing these aspects in a unified view is an interesting target.

The inclusion of such different systems suggests applications to fields where allometry is emerging, such as economics, urban planning and the social sciences...|$|R

50|$|Implied {{terms are}} not {{explicitly}} agreed {{upon by the}} parties but nevertheless form part of the contract. They are {{binding on the parties}} without their having made any explicit agreement as to the points in question. They are effectively naturalia and usually entail legal duties, and in some cases may be varied or excluded by the parties, as in a contract of sale voetstoots. These terms derive from the common law, from trade usage or customs, and from statute. Most terms <b>implied</b> <b>in</b> <b>law</b> come from the common law, but there is not a closed list, because contract law is not static. A term may not be implied if it conflicts with the contract’s express terms, or if these indicate that the parties did not wish to include that term.|$|R

40|$|Despite a clear {{case for}} {{thinking}} skills in legal education, {{the approach to}} teaching these skills often appears to be <b>implied</b> <b>in</b> <b>law</b> curricula rather than identified explicitly. Thinking skills could be taught as part of reading law and legal problem solving.

The challenge for law teachers is to articulate how to learn legal thinking skills, and to do so at each level of the degree. This article outlines how the nexus between three component skills: critical legal thinking, reading law, and legal problem solving, can be put to work to provide a cohesive and scaffolded approach to the teaching of legal thinking.

5000|$|Many {{contracts}} include [...] "satisfaction clauses", {{in which}} a promisor can refuse to pay if he isn't subjectively satisfied with the promisee's performance. Strictly speaking, this is an illusory promise, since the promisor has no actual legal burden to pay if he chooses not to. However, courts will generally <b>imply</b> <b>in</b> <b>law</b> that the promisor must act in good faith and reject the deal only if he is genuinely dissatisfied. As another example, if a contract promises a promisee {{a certain percentage of}} the proceeds of a promisor's business activities, this is illusory, since the promisor doesn't have to do anything: any percentage of zero is zero. However, courts may find that the promisor made an implied promise to use reasonable efforts to try to make money, and cite him for breach of contract if he does absolutely nothing. [...] The U.C.C. in contracts exclusive to both sides requires [...] "best efforts" [...] in such contracts. This may be read to be the same as a good faith effort, but is seen by some courts as a higher duty.|$|R

The key implied term, however, is the duty of good faith, or “mutual trust and confidence”. This is a flexible concept that is applied in a broad variety of circumstances leading to remedies in damages or an injunction, such as to require employers do not act in an authoritarian manner, call employees names behind their back, treat workers unequally when upgrading pay, run the company as a front for international crime, or exercise discretion to award a bonus capriciously.

From a consideration of this order and of the absolute amount of adsorption in each case we find very little reason to place much credence <b>in</b> Schulze's <b>law.</b> Although we find a quadrivalent ion the most strongly adsorbed, we find four univalent ions more strongly adsorbed than the trivalent ferricyanide. Furthermore, contrary to what is <b>implied</b> <b>in</b> Schulze's <b>law,</b> we find a very wide variation in the amount of univalent ions adsorbed. This amount varies from 8. 482 gram anions per 100 mols for nitrate to 0. 056 gram anions per 100 mols for iodide ion. If the adsorption values are expressed in gram anions instead of gram equivalent anions the order becomes: nitrates > nitrites > chlorate > ferrocyanide > permanganate > chloride > ferricyanide > bromide > sulphocyanate > iodide, the nitrate ion being adsorbed the most and the iodide the least.
