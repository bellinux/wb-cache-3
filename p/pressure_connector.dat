40|$|From August 1990 to December 2007, 156 {{patients}} with humeral shaft nonunion {{were treated with}} our patented Ni-Ti shape memory alloy swan-like memory <b>pressure</b> <b>connector</b> (SMC). The SMC device cooled with ice before implantation was warmed to 40 – 50 °C after implantation to produce balanced axial and compression forces to stabilise the fracture three-dimensionally. This combined with autologous bone grafting achieved bone tissue regeneration in the fracture and promoted smooth recovery of joint function, with a nonunion healing rate of 98. 7 % after a single SMC implantation. Failure of nonunion healing occurred in only two cases but was successfully managed by a further operation. Complications were not found {{in any of these}} patients apart from four with pre-existing radial nerve injuries. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the SMC device for the management of humeral shaft nonunion. The device provides continuous compression of the fracture with minimal trauma to the local blood supply...|$|E
40|$|Background/Purpose The use of needleless {{positive}} <b>pressure</b> <b>connector</b> valves (PPVs) on venous access devices (VADs) {{has been}} shown to have possible benefits in decreasing VAD occlusion rates. Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) rates, however, have been variable. With this potential for improving patient outcomes, decreasing costs, and facilitating nursing care and catheter management, the use of PPV devices becomes both advantageous and desirable. Methodology This was a randomized, prospective, parallel clinical study of 160 medical and surgical step-down unit patients requiring parenteral therapies. Patients were equally randomized to two study groups to assess the impact on occlusion and CRBSI rates, using a PPV versus a standard cap without PPV. VADs included both peripherally inserted catheters (PICCs) and midlines. Results Seven VAD occlusions occurred; six in the experimental group, one in the control group (p = 0. 43). Also, two CRBSIs occurred in the experimental group, with none in the control group (p = 0. 497). All incidents occurred in doublelumen PICCs. The lack of statistical {{difference between the two groups}} for occlusions and CRBSIs indicates that the use of PPVs had no impact in preventing such outcomes. However, it was observed that the number of double-lumen PICCs and their dwelling time in the experimental group was significantly higher (p = 0. 003). Conclusion There was no difference in the rate of catheter occlusions or CRBSIs when using PPVs or standard caps. We consider that the study outcomes may be due to the study's small sample size, and we speculate that longer dwell time of double lumen catheters may have contributed to these outcomes. These observations deserve further investigation. However, the use of PPVs may still be advantageous from a nursing process perspective. The use of peripherally inserted venous access devices (VADs) such as midlines and peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) for intravenous infusions has become common practice in the hospital, as well as in the home-care setting. The main advantages of using these types of VADs include the ease of insertion, cost reduction, and lower complication rates. However, occlusion and infectious complications are not uncommon. Historically, clinicians have used a variety of techniques to prevent VAD occlusion. These include vigorous flushing, coordinated flushing and clamping, and pulsatile flow technique. Despite these methods, it has been estimated that 25 % of central VADs become occluded. This leads to interruptions and delays in therapy administration and to the need for VAD replacement, associated with increased risk of complications to the patient and increased costs (Stephens, Haire, & Kotulak, 1995; Hoch, 1997). Therefore, prevention of VAD occlusion is essential. Needleless positive <b>pressure</b> <b>connector</b> valves (PPVs) prevent the reflux of blood into the VAD lumen by activating an antegrade flow of fluid through the VAD as the flush syringe is disconnected from the device. These types of devices have been shown to significantly decrease VAD occlusion rates by 8. 2 %, when compared to a standard connector device (Jacobs et al., 2004). However, there have been reports that PPVs increase the risk of catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) (Rupp et al., 2007; Maragakis et al., 2006). One theory behind the increase in CRBSI rates is the possible design flaws in the PPV cap, causing microorganisms to collect in ridges and making it difficult to adequately disinfect the top of the cap prior to its use. Since these reports were published, the technology of PPVs has improved, to promote adequate cleansing prior to use. Potential benefits of using PPVs on VADs include decreased VAD-related complications, improved patient outcomes, and cost savings. Additionally, significant cost savings with PPV use were reportedly attributed to decreased use of thrombolytics to maintain VAD patency (Rummel, Donnelly, & Fortenbaugh, 2001). The purpose of this study was to determine if the use of one of the newer generation PPVs on VADs would prevent or reduce the incidence of VAD occlusion or increase the rate of CRBSI.

50|$|Occasionally, the {{secondary}} second-stage {{is combined with}} the inflation and exhaust valve assembly of the buoyancy compensator device. This combination {{eliminates the need for}} a separate low pressure hose for the BC, though the low <b>pressure</b> hose <b>connector</b> for combined use must have a larger bore than for standard BC inflation hoses, because it will need to deliver a higher flow rate if it is used for breathing. This combination unit is carried in the position where the inflator unit would normally hang {{on the left side of}} the chest. With integrated DV/BC inflator designs, {{the secondary}} demand valve is at the end of the shorter BC inflation hose, and the donor must retain access to it for buoyancy control, so donation of the primary regulator to help another diver is essential with this configuration. The secondary demand valve is often partially yellow in color, and may use a yellow hose, for high visibility, and as an indication that it is an emergency or backup device. When a side-mount configuration is used, the usefulness of a secondary demand valve is greatly reduced, as each cylinder will have a regulator and the one not in use is available as a backup. This configuration also allows the entire cylinder to be handed off to the receiver, so a long hose is also less likely to be needed. Some diving instructors continue to teach buddy-breathing from a single demand valve as an obsolescent but still occasionally useful technique, learned in addition to the use of the backup DV, since availability of two second stages per diver is now assumed as standard in recreational scuba.|$|R

S. dollars in 2009 and has a success rate of up to 77 % for a single dose; and 87 % with the second dose 6, 13. If the treatment is unsuccessful, a new catheter {{may need to be}} placed. Catheter replacement also increases costs and may increase patient discomfort and cause additional trauma. These variables can be used to calculate the impact of catheter occlusions in the United States annually as depicted in Table 1 and could add up to over $ 100 million annually in health-care costs. Reducing Risks Associated with Thrombotic Catheter Occlusions Survey results of 554 nurses demonstrated that there is a significant gap of knowledge about specific needle-free connectors utilized today and the specific clamping sequences required.

40|$|ObjectiveThe Excimer laser-assisted nonocclusive anastomotic {{technique}} is a nonocclusive, facilitated bypass technique {{that is currently}} Conformité Européenne and Food and Drug Administration approved for clinical application in neurosurgery. In the present study, we assessed the safety and feasibility of a newly developed Excimer laser-assisted nonocclusive anastomosis-based prototype coronary anastomotic connector in an acute rabbit abdominal aortic bypass model before application in experimental coronary bypass surgery. In addition, 2 sealants were tested to facilitate anastomotic hemostasis in the current device prototype. MethodsA total of 40 anastomoses were constructed on the abdominal aorta (3. 5 mm outer diameter) of 10 rabbits. The anastomotic circumference was sealed by a surgical sealant to obtain complete hemostasis (BioGlue vs TachoSil). The anastomoses were evaluated by flow measurements construction time, hemostasis, histologic analysis, and burst <b>pressure</b> testing. ResultsThe <b>connector</b> enabled a nonocclusive and fast (6. 0  ±  1. 7 minutes, mean ± SD [including sealing]) anastomosis construction and complete hemostasis in 95 % (35 / 37). Sealing with BioGlue was faster than with TachoSil (19 % vs 53 % of construction time). Despite technical imperfections (7 / 40 failures to completely retrieve the flap by the laser), all 40 anastomoses were patent, showed reproducible construction with intima–adventitia apposition, streamlining thrombus coverage of the intraluminal laser rim, and no vessel wall damage. All anastomoses resisted ex vivo supraphysiologic pressures (> 300 mm Hg). ConclusionsThe {{results of the present}} study have demonstrated that the Excimer laser-assisted nonocclusive anastomotic connector is safe and reliable and can be efficiently applied in an acute rabbit abdominal aortic bypass model. Provided the limitations can be addressed, this easy-to-use and nonocclusive technique has the potential to facilitate minimally invasive coronary bypass surgery...|$|R
40|$|During the {{self-assembly}} of bacteriophage phi 29, the {{viral genome}} is packaged into a pre-formed capsid by a molecular motor. The packaging motor {{is a complex}} of several oligomers including a dodecameric connector ring and a pentameric ATPase ring. These rings coordinate with each other, generating high forces in order to compact the dsDNA genome into the capsid at high <b>pressures.</b> The <b>connector</b> was proposed to engage and directly perform work on the DNA during packaging. Consideration of the symmetry of the connector and the capsid predicts that the connector must rotate relative to the capsid {{as part of the}} mechanism for translocating the DNA. An experiment designed to directly measure rotation of the connector is discussed in Chapter 2 of this dissertation. A combination magnetic tweezers and total internal reflection microscope is used to track the polarization of single fluorescent dyes attached to the connector. No evidence of polarization changes were found, indicating that the connector does not rotate at the expected rates. This further suggests that the connector does not directly perform mechanical work on the DNA during packaging. Viral packaging can be observed in optical tweezers by monitoring the length of the DNA as it is drawn into the capsid. Past studies have revealed many details of the packaging mechanism by following the dependence of the packaging velocity on factors like ATP concentration and applied load. In Chapter 3, I propose an experimental design intended to measure the effect of the packaging motor on the angle of the DNA in addition to its length and thus recover the full three-dimensional trajectory of the DNA as it passes into the capsid. In addition, this scheme can be used to apply torque and thus provides an additional tool with which to probe the packaging mechanism. In Chapter 4, we find that during packaging the downstream DNA is twisted in an underwinding direction, with a magnitude that depends {{on the extent to which}} the capsid is filled. The change in twisting can be attributed to cumulative looping of the DNA within the capsid, and the data predicts that the loops formed in the last kilobasepair of packaging are as small as 4 nm in radius. In addition, a non-lethal method of rupturing the viral capsids prior to packaging was discovered. Observations of DNA twisting by those packaging complexes revealed that, in the absence of internal pressure, the DNA is twisted by - 1. 2 °/bp. This number suggests that one of the packaging motor's five subunits makes contact with the DNA every ten basepairs, and that the cycle repeats with that subunit performing the same function every time. Such a strict functional segregation, in addition to the catalytic segregation revealed in previous high-resolution optical tweezers experiments, is an important part of the mechanism by which the motor packages DNA against high forces...|$|R
