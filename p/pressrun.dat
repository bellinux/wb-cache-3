40|$|Gear marking is a print {{defect in}} flexography. It {{appears as a}} uniformly spaced pattern of lateral {{alternating}} dark and light bands along the web length corresponding to the distance between gear teeth. A comprehensive definition characterizes gear marking as a regular pattern attributable to metal burrs, nicks, debris, or other flaws that lead to unsmooth movement somewhere in the mechanical system of the press. Gear marking {{can be caused by}} a multitude of different factors. In most cases, gear marking results from more than one phenomenon. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate some factors that were expected to contribute to both the causes and the severity of flexographic gear marking. The factors studied (independent variables) included plate hardness, and surface speed differential between the plate image area and the substrate when gear mark severity was the dependent variable of the study. The test target were designed and printed on the RIT 2 ̆ 7 s Mark Andy 4120 System narrow-web press. To study the effect of plate hardness, three plate types with different hardness, 40 Shore A, 50 Shore A, and 60 Shore A, were used. To study the effect of surface speed differential, two types of stickybacks, 0. 015 inch and 0. 020 inch, were used to create variations in surface speed differentials. Six <b>pressruns</b> were performed; the first three <b>pressruns</b> were of three plate hardness mounted on 0. 015 -inch stickybacks and the others were of three plate hardness mounted on 0. 020 -inch stickybacks. A group of thirty observers at the Rochester Institute of Technology were asked to participate in press sheet visual evaluation by ranking six sample press sheets in terms of gear mark severity. The Verity IA software was used to measure the horizontal bar defect indices on sample sheets of six <b>pressruns</b> for the quantitative analysis of gear mark severity. The results indicated that plate hardness and differential in surface speed affected the gear mark severity in flexography significantly. A lower plate hardness will produce more noticeable in gear marking than a higher one. A higher differential in surface speed will produce more noticeable in gear marking than a lower differential...|$|R
40|$|The flexographic {{printing}} process has historically had difficulty printing vignettes and highlights. In comparison to offset lithography and gravure, flexography suffers from dark highlights, dirty colors, less 2 ̆ 2 crispness 2 ̆ 2 and {{an inability to}} print full-range vignettes. The predominant belief by the printers and manufacturers in the flexographic industry is that these difficulties arise from the excessive dot gain inherent to the process. One major cause of dot gain in flexography {{is believed to be}} the halftone dot structure on the printing plate. Many methods have been developed around modification of the traditional plate creation methods with the goal of obtaining an optimal dot structure for minimizing dot gain on press. These methods have included the use of alternate light sources, exposure time modifications, FM screening, direct-to-plate technology and others. One explanation that hasn 2 ̆ 7 t been explored is that the printed dot size is purely a function of the ability to produce a small dot on the printing plate. This work performed a series of <b>pressruns</b> using a selection of the popular halftone dot creation technologies to determine whether it is merely the ability to put the smallest dot on the plate that provides optimum print quality. Additionally, the performance of each of the methods was compared to determine which one (if any) produced the best results. The methods used included conventional and digital platemaking methods and the use of alternate light sources, exposure times, and screening methods. Tone reproduction was evaluated using a metric derived from colorimetric data known as...|$|R

Contemporary reviews were also generally positive, with the New York Times concluding, “This story, in all its guilelessness, appealing {{as it does to}} human love, will certainly please readers, irrespective of race or creed.” Offering similar praise for her writing and the perceived authenticity of her work, the Boston Herald stated, “The whole narrative is very agreeably and naturally written, and nothing is introduced but what the child saw with her own eyes, endured in her own flesh and blood, thought in her own little head.” Other publications drew favorable comparisons with Israel Zangwill, the author of the book's preface and an accomplished Jewish writer himself, with the Kalamazoo Gazette proclaiming, “little Mary promises to become the most forceful Jewish writer of English in the world, not excepting Zangwill himself.” ...|$|E
40|$|A color {{separation}} technique known as Gray Component Replacement, or GCR {{has been an}} option available to high-end drum scanner operators {{for the past eight}} years. Recently, GCR has been made available by lower-end color system vendors as well. GCR consists of removing the least predominant process color ink in a unit area, reducing the remaining colored inks by the same amount and replacing the 2 ̆ 2 gray component 2 ̆ 2 of the color with black ink. One of the reported benefits of the GCR technique is that more consistency can be realized during a <b>pressrun.</b> If this is in fact true, the first publication printers who would surely utilize the technique would be newspapers. The problem of consistency is particularly acute for newspapers. There are a number of reasons for this, but the primary ones relate to the types of materials used. Newspapers use the cheapest paper and ink and in many cases, they print with old or poorly maintained presses. They would surely welcome any process that offered better reproductive quality and more consistency, provided the investment was justifiable. Since their present {{color separation}} systems allow for the use of GCR in the majority of cases, its potential in the area of newspaper printing was investigated in this study. One factor determining consistency during a <b>pressrun</b> is the control of ink film thickness. As ink film thickness fluctuates, color variation takes place. This study compared the amount of color variation realized for a conventional separation and GCR separations as ink film thickness was varied on press. A separation was made conventionally and with five levels of GCR (however only 40...|$|E
40|$|The Encyclopaedia britannica is a {{familiar}} cultural icon, {{but what do we}} know about the early editions that helped shape it into the longest continuously published encyclopedia still in existence? This first examination of the three eighteenth-century editions traces the Britannicaâs extraordinary development into a best seller and an exceptional book of knowledge, especially in biography and in the natural sciences. The combined expertise of the contributors to this volume allows an extensive exploration of each edition, covering its publication history and evolving editorial practices, its commentary on subjects that came in and out of fashion and its contemporary reception. The contributors also examine the cultural and intellectual milieu in which the Britannica flourished, discussing its role in the Scottish Enlightenment and comparing its <b>pressrun,</b> contents, reputation, and influence with those of the much more reform-minded EncyclopÃ©die. 'The contributors have conducted an extraordinarily thorough investigation of the Encyclopaedia britannica. [ [...] . ] They have unearthed valuable information about the editors and contributors to the first three editions and present compelling evidence about the range and treatment of their sources. This volume could greatly contribute to our understanding of the state of knowledge at the end of the eighteenth century. ' Judith Hawley, Royal Holloway, University of London Introduction, Frank A.

40|$|The {{number of}} {{possible}} reproducible colors in a printing method is called the color gamut. This gamut is the range of colors around the spectrum and from light to dark that {{are available in the}} process. Previous research has found that the three parameters, spectral reflectance of the ink, solid ink density level and screening method, all influence the gamut in process color printing. This thesis evaluated how much these parameters change the color gamut both as individual parameters and in combination. A test target with 168 patches in the most saturated combinations of cyan, magenta, yellow and black was printed and measured with a spectrophotometer. The three coordinates L*, a* and b* for each patch in the target was plotted in the CIELAB space. Connecting these points forms a three dimensional object, the color gamut volume. By calculating the volume of this object the number of CIELAB combinations that can be reproduced in the system was derived. The <b>pressrun</b> was made at three levels of solid ink density and the targets were screened using frequency and amplitude modulated screening. The print was made on the six color Heidelberg Speedmaster 72 sheet fed lithography press at School of Printing Management and Science, Rochester Institute of Technology. The inks that were used in the test print are the Naturalith process cyan, magenta, yellow and black from Sun Chemical. In addition to these, a fluorescent magenta and yellow ink from DayGlo 2 ̆ 7 s ink series Starfire were used. These alternative magenta and yellow inks were printed with the Naturalith cyan and black. In this way two four color process combinations were evaluated with only six inks. The prints where made on a glossy coated paper, Centura Gloss from Consolidated Paper Inc. The result show that: Fluorescent inks can be used in process color printing and that they produced a color gamut that reproduce light and more colorful colors than normal process colors, while dark colors were reproduced with lower colorfulness. The fluorescent inks that were used are semi transparent and can not yield a dark black when printed on top of black. The solution is to use a high degree of under color removal and or to printing black as the last down ink. High solid ink densities was found to increase the color gamut for both ink sets. Frequency modulated screening was found to reproduce a color gamut with significantly higher gamut for the normal sheet fed inks, while no increase could be found for the fluorescent inks. By using frequency modulated screening and increasing the solid ink density when using normal sheet fed ink, the color gamut could be increased about 30 percent compared to amplitude modulated screening and SWOP solid ink densities. The Silicon Graphics based 3 D software Explorer was found to be a very useful tool when determining the shape of the color gamut...|$|E
