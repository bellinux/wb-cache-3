5|$|On 26 April 1924, an {{electric}} multiple unit {{collided with the}} rear of an excursion train carrying passengers from the FA Cup Final in Coventry. Five passengers were killed. The accident was blamed on <b>poor</b> <b>visibility</b> owing to smoke and steam under the Park Street Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Highway21 {{is often}} subject to {{closures}} {{at various points}} as it lies on the lee shore of Lake Huron. Lake effect snow squalls frequently subject motorists to <b>poor</b> <b>visibility</b> and slippery conditions, leading to whiteout conditions. Because of this, the Ontario Provincial Police claim that the road is the most often closed in the province.|$|E
50|$|Ratings {{still remain}} poor in {{comparison}} to NBA games. In 2008, WNBA games averaged just 413,000 viewers, compared to 1.46 million viewers on ESPN and over 2.2 million on ABC for NBA games. In addition, WNBA games have much <b>poorer</b> <b>visibility,</b> attendance, and ratings than NCAA games.|$|R

40|$|By {{means of}} several {{automobile}} traverses the heat island of a middlesized {{city in a}} tropical highland has been determined. The observed 5 º temperature contrasts are in agreement with size of urban area. Seasonal variation of the heat island is examined using minimum temperatures. The increasing levels of air pollution are leading to higher frequency of <b>poor</b> <b>visibilities</b> and to an intensification of the heat island...|$|R
5|$|In 1992, the Albert Bridge was rewired {{and painted}} {{in an unusual}} colour scheme {{designed}} {{to make it more}} conspicuous in <b>poor</b> <b>visibility,</b> and avoid being damaged by ships. At night it is illuminated by 4,000bulbs, making it one of west London's most striking landmarks. In 2010–2011, these were replaced with LEDs.|$|E
5|$|Vision, chemoreception (tongue-flicking) {{and hearing}} are {{important}} senses for terrestrial snakes but these stimuli become distorted in water. The <b>poor</b> <b>visibility,</b> chemical dilution and limitation of ground-borne vibrations underwater suggest that sea snakes and sea kraits may have unique sensory abilities {{to compensate for}} the relative lack of other sensory cues.|$|E
5|$|Another uneventful advance {{into the}} North Sea {{took place on}} 21–22 April. A {{bombardment}} mission followed two days later; Posen joined the battleship support for Hipper's battlecruisers while they attacked Yarmouth and Lowestoft on 24–25 April. During this operation, the battlecruiser Seydlitz was damaged by a British mine and {{had to return to}} port prematurely. Due to the <b>poor</b> <b>visibility,</b> the operation was soon called off, leaving the British fleet no time to intercept the raiders.|$|E
25|$|Lighting - Neponset St. has sharp (90 degree) curves {{before and}} after the viaduct, causing <b>poor</b> forward <b>visibility</b> {{especially}} at night due to inadequate street lighting and lack of any viaduct lighting.|$|R
50|$|JR Raphael of Computerworld {{liked the}} LG G Watch's {{superior}} dimmed-mode display, comfortable band, and easy-to-use charging cradle, {{but did not}} like the uninspired design and <b>poor</b> outdoor <b>visibility</b> display compared to Samsung Gear Live.|$|R
2500|$|Tailwheel {{aircraft}} generally {{suffer from}} <b>poorer</b> forward <b>visibility</b> on the ground, compared to nose wheel aircraft. Often this requires continuous [...] "S" [...] {{turns on the}} ground to allow the pilot to see where they are taxiing.|$|R
5|$|In hindsight, Callaghan {{was criticized}} for not putting his five ships that had the {{superior}} SG radar systems {{at the ends of}} his column, for not using one of them as his flagship, for directing the battle from his flagship's bridge instead of the radar plot, for not issuing his battle plans to his captains, and for issuing confusing orders during the battle. Analysis of the battle led to a rapid improvement in USN techniques for fighting in <b>poor</b> <b>visibility,</b> particularly in the adoption of combat information centers.|$|E
5|$|After the Republic was proclaimed, the {{national}} flag was provisionally adopted as distinguishing {{flag of the}} head of state in place of the royal standard. On the initiative of the Ministry of Defence, a project was prepared in 1965 to adopt a distinct flag. Opportunity suggested the most natural solution was the Italian tricolour defaced with the coat of arms; however, under conditions of <b>poor</b> <b>visibility,</b> this could easily be mistaken for the standard of the President of the United States of Mexico, which is also that country's national flag. The standard is kept in the custody of the Commander of the Reggimento Corazzieri of the Arma dei Carabinieri, along with the war flag (assigned to Regiment in 1878).|$|E
5|$|Ben Nevis's popularity, {{climate and}} complex {{topography}} {{contribute to a}} high number of mountain rescue incidents. In 1999, for example, there were 41 rescues and four fatalities on the mountain. Some accidents arise over difficulties in navigating to or from the summit, especially in <b>poor</b> <b>visibility.</b> The problem {{stems from the fact that}} the summit plateau is roughly kidney-shaped and surrounded by cliffs on three sides; the danger is particularly accentuated when the main path is obscured by snow. Two precise compass bearings taken in succession are necessary to navigate from the summit cairn to the west flank, from where a descent can be made on the Pony Track in relative safety.|$|E
50|$|An {{inherent}} {{problem with}} all these tail-sitter designs was <b>poor</b> pilot <b>visibility,</b> especially of the ground, during vertical descent and landing. This led to the concept being abandoned once a more practical form of VTOL appeared, {{in the form of}} thrust vectoring.|$|R
25|$|The first Ki-44 {{prototype}} flew in August 1940 and {{the initial}} test flights were generally encouraging, with handling considered acceptable considering the high wing loading. Problems encountered included a high landing speed and <b>poor</b> forward <b>visibility</b> during taxiing due to the large radial engine.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to improve overtaking safety and efficiency through improvements in road signage, markings, geometry and speed control associated with the placement and layout of passing lanes. The approach of the research was to explore the effects of several types of overtaking lane treatments in the safety and controlled environment of a state-of-the-art driving simulator. It was found that under the most benign conditions there were no differential effects of the three treatments. With <b>poorer</b> <b>visibility</b> or more taxing road geometry, the drivers relied more heavily on the road markings and signage and the effects of the treatments become more pronounced. The sensitivity to the more "challenging" situations was borne out by the greater speed differential between merge area sections at these sites...|$|R
5|$|Between 17:48 and 17:52, Posen and ten other German battleships {{engaged the}} British 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron, though {{the range and}} <b>poor</b> <b>visibility</b> {{prevented}} effective fire. Shortly thereafter, two British destroyers— and —came under intense fire from the German line. Posen fired at Nestor with both her main battery and secondary guns. At 18:35, Nestor exploded and sank under the combined fire of eight battleships. By 20:15, the German fleet had faced the Grand Fleet {{for a second time}} and was forced to turn away; in doing so, the order of the German line was reversed. Posen was now the fourth ship in the line, astern of her three sisters.|$|E
5|$|Feth-i Bülend saw {{extensive}} {{service in}} the Black Sea during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, based primarily at Batumi. She {{took part in the}} bombardment of Russian positions and capture of the Black Sea port of Sokhumi on 14–16 May 1877. On 23 July, she engaged the Russian armed steamer Vesta in an inconclusive action. <b>Poor</b> <b>visibility</b> from smoke and escaping steam forced the ships to disengage, both with slight damage and few casualties. On the 31st, Feth-i Bülend and several other ships departed Batumi for Trabzon to bring ground troops to Varna to defend against an expected Russian attack across the Danube.|$|E
5|$|In the confusion, {{the tail}} of the Dutch line {{disintegrated}} into a chaotic melee, with eight British ships of the line fighting four Dutch and the frigate Monnikkendam. So close was the action that the British ships found themselves at risk of firing into one another in the high seas, heavy rain and <b>poor</b> <b>visibility.</b> The Dutch centre, consisting of the ships of the line Brutus, Leijden and the fifth rate razee Mars, pulled away from the engagement behind them under Rear-Admiral Johan Bloys van Treslong, coming under only distant fire from the ships of Onslow's division. Isolated, the Dutch rearguard were rapidly overwhelmed, with Jupiter, Haarlem, Alkmaar and Delft all surrendering to Onslow's attack before 13:45, while the battered Monnikkendam was seized by the frigate Beaulieu.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} was a one seated, high-wing monoplane. It {{was designed as}} a fighter, but its engine was under-powered, the speed moderate and flight characteristics <b>poor.</b> The <b>visibility</b> from the pilot's seat was also very poor. The {{aircraft was}} in Finnish Air Force use for a short time.|$|R
50|$|JR Raphael of Computerworld {{preferred}} the Gear Live's illuminated display {{compared to the}} LG G Watch, more distinctive design and the heart-rate sensor but {{did not like the}} <b>poor</b> outdoor <b>visibility,</b> the hard to use charger, awkward watch band and that it includes a redundant preinstalled stopwatch application.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in the Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) and ground/aircraft data-links {{provide a basis for}} the generation of an accurate cockpit navigational map display including data-linked ATC-cleared ground routes. Such an electronic map may have the potential to improve pilots' situation awareness and taxi performance and thereby lessen runway incursions. The objective of this simulator study was to assess the potential improvements in these areas when using an advanced electronic map (compared to using today's paper map) under two outside scene visibility levels. Results showed average taxi speed increased under both good and <b>poor</b> <b>visibilities,</b> by as much as 24 percent, due in part to eliminating the time used for orientation with the paper map. Pilots made only one-third as many errors as well and commented that they believed that the electronic map gave them better awareness...|$|R
5|$|It was at {{this stage}} that the attack began to go seriously wrong. Strong winds blowing off the land swept the smoke screen {{into the face of}} the {{advancing}} cruisers, blinding their commanders who attempted to navigate by dead reckoning. The same wind disclosed the Inshore Squadron to the German defenders who immediately opened up a withering fire on the blockships. With their volunteer crews suffering heavy casualties, the commanders increased speed despite the <b>poor</b> <b>visibility</b> and continued groping through the narrow channels inshore, searching for the Stroom Bank buoy which directed shipping into the canal.|$|E
5|$|On 9 April 1940 the Germans {{launched}} Operation Weserübung. <b>Poor</b> <b>visibility</b> enabled {{most of the}} German invasion fleet {{to evade}} detection {{until it was too}} late. Reconnaissance aircraft of Coastal Command had sighted and reported movements of the Scharnhorst and Gneisenau on 7 April. However, they were believed to be on exercise and not operations. They were sighted again the next day by No. 204 Squadron RAFs Sunderlands. Coastal Command was now ordered to carry out extensive reconnaissance operations in the North Sea and around the Norwegian Coast. It was the Command's reconnaissance operations that located the German cruiser Königsberg in Bergen fjord. Blackburn Skuas of No. 800 and 803 Squadrons FAA sank the vessel.|$|E
5|$|Scharnhorst and Gneisenau {{had reached}} a point north-west of Lofoten, Norway, by 12:00 on 9 April. The two ships then turned west for 24hours while {{temporary}} repairs were effected. After a day of steaming west, the ships turned south and rendezvoused with Admiral Hipper on 12 April. An RAF patrol aircraft spotted the three ships that day, which prompted an air attack. The German warships were protected by <b>poor</b> <b>visibility,</b> however, and the three ships safely reached port later that day. Scharnhorst returned to Germany, and was repaired at the Deutsche Werke in Kiel. During the repair process, the aircraft catapult that had been installed on the rear gun turret was removed.|$|E
5000|$|Conventional cabs are {{the most}} common in North America and Australia. The driver is seated behind the engine, as in most {{passenger}} cars or pickup trucks. Conventionals are further divided into large car and aerodynamic designs. A [...] "large car" [...] or [...] "long nose" [...] is a conventional truck with a long (6 to 8 foot (1.8 to 2.4 m) or more) hood. With their very square shapes, these trucks experience a lot of wind resistance and typically consume more fuel. They also provide somewhat <b>poorer</b> <b>visibility</b> than their aerodynamic or COE counterparts. By contrast, Aerodynamic cabs are very streamlined, with a sloped hood and other features to lower drag. The front doors are behind (and mostly above) the front tires. Access to a conventional cabin is commonly by steps at or near the fuel tank(s) behind the front tires.|$|R
50|$|The C70 {{convertible}} exhibited two {{negative traits}} endemic to convertibles: <b>poor</b> rear <b>visibility</b> and pronounced scuttle shake, a characteristic whereby the structural {{design of the}} bulkhead between engine and passenger compartment of a convertible suffers sufficiently poor rigidity to negatively impact ride and handling, allowing noticeable vibration, shudder or chassis-flexing into the passenger compartment.|$|R
5000|$|The Hansa-Brandenburg D.I {{had serious}} {{liabilities}} {{as a fighter}} plane; it spun easily, had <b>poor</b> forward <b>visibility,</b> and its machine gun was mounted well above the pilot's head on the top wing to fire above the propeller arc. It was nicknamed [...] "the flying coffin" [...] and killed more pilots in flying accidents than died in combat.|$|R
5|$|Shortly {{after passing}} Fobney Lock and the {{associated}} water treatment works, the Kennet flood plain narrows and the river enters a narrow steep-sided gap in the hills forming the southern flank of the Thames flood plain. At County Lock the river enters the centre of Reading, where it formerly flowed through the centre of a large brewery. This narrow and twisting stretch of the river became known as Brewery Gut. Because of <b>poor</b> <b>visibility</b> {{and the difficulty of}} boats passing in this stretch, traffic has long been controlled by a set of maritime traffic lights. Today the Brewery Gut is a major feature of Reading's The Oracle shopping centre.|$|E
5|$|The Admiralty ordered Captain Warburton-Lee {{to attack}} German {{shipping}} in Narvik, Norway on 9 April. The following morning Hardy led four of her half-sisters down Ofotfjord in a surprise dawn attack on Narvik harbour during a blinding snowstorm. A torpedo from Hardy blew off {{the stern of}} the German flagship, , and killed the German flotilla commander, Commodore Friedrich Bonte. Heidkamp sank the next day. Another hit a merchant ship in the stern. A second salvo of four torpedoes was fired at two other German destroyers, but missed and badly damaged the ore docks. After regrouping, Captain Warburton-Lee led another attack on the harbour later that morning, but inflicted little additional damage due to <b>poor</b> <b>visibility.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{ash fall}} created some {{temporary}} major problems with transportation, sewage disposal, and water treatment systems. Visibility was greatly decreased during the ash fall, closing many highways and roads. Interstate 90 from Seattle to Spokane {{was closed for}} a week and a half. Air travel was disrupted for between a few days and two weeks, as several airports in eastern Washington shut down because of ash accumulation and <b>poor</b> <b>visibility.</b> Over a thousand commercial flights were cancelled following airport closures. Fine-grained, gritty ash caused substantial problems for internal-combustion engines and other mechanical and electrical equipment. The ash contaminated oil systems and clogged air filters, and scratched moving surfaces. Fine ash caused short circuits in electrical transformers, which in turn caused power blackouts.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, the 167 km stage 10 from Pau to Hautacam, {{including}} a passage over the 2114 m./6935 ft. Col du Tourmalet {{was selected for}} L'Étape du Tour with Laurent Four coming home in the fastest time of 5 hours 38 minutes. Unfortunately, the weather on the day was very <b>poor</b> and <b>visibility</b> at {{the summit of the}} Tourmalet was down to 10m.|$|R
50|$|This {{configuration}} gives a cab or carbody unit <b>poor</b> rear <b>visibility</b> {{compared with}} a hood unit. For that reason, cab or carbody units are mostly used in situations where rear visibility is not important, such as power for through freight and passenger trains. Cab and carbody units are also more aerodynamic than hood units, and pulled many of the streamliner trains.|$|R
50|$|The Aberdeen URNU {{operated}} from 1967 until 2012 {{before being}} moved to Edinburgh.
