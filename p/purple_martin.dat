2500|$|During the {{breeding}} season, {{at least half}} of the chimney swift's forays occur within [...] of its nest; however, it ranges up to [...] away. While most of its food is seized following aerial pursuit, some is gleaned from the foliage of trees; the bird hovers near the ends of branches or drops through upper canopy levels. The chimney swift generally flies quite high, though it descends during cold or rainy weather. When feeding, it regularly occurs in small groups, and sometimes hunts with swallows, particularly barn swallows and purple martins; in mixed-species flocks, it is typically among the lower fliers. There is at least one record of a chimney swift attempting to steal a dragonfly from a <b>purple</b> <b>martin,</b> and it has been observed chasing other purple martins. In general, it is a diurnal feeder which remains active into early evening. However, there are records, particularly during migration periods, of chimney swifts feeding well after dark over brightly lit buildings.|$|E
2500|$|In 1964 a new {{aircraft}} the squadron received it first UH-1E Iroquois. In August 1965 VMO-6 departed {{as part of}} Marine Aircraft Group 36 on board the [...] for Vietnam. On September 1, 1965 the squadron began operating from Chu Lai. After training by the Army, the Hueys were converted to primarily a gunship role {{and the majority of}} the UH-1's missions were providing close air support to infantry and recon units. They participated in the following operations while operating from there: Quang Ngai, Double Eagle, Blue Marlin, Duc Pho. While providing support to Marines at the Battle of Hill 488 on the night of 15 June 1966, the squadron's new commanding officer, Major William J. Goodsell, was killed when his UH-1E was shot down. In October 1967 the squadron moved to just south of Huế to Phu Bai. A month later another move took them to Quảng Trị Combat Base. [...] July 1968 saw the squadron get its first fixed wing aircraft since World War II when they took possession of a few Cessna O-1C Birddogs that were used for directing air strikes. [...] These were followed in October 1968 when the first contingent of six OV-10A Broncos joined VMO-6 at Marble Mountain Air Facility. They began operating within 18 hours of joining the squadron at Quảng Trị. The squadron flew in support of Marines at Khe Sanh, Con Thien, Lao Bảo, Đông Hà, Gio Linh, The Rockpile, Vandegrift Combat Base, the Ben Hai and Firebase Argonne. They flew in support of the following operations: Maine Crag, Apache Snow, Scotland II, Montana Mauler, Napoleon-Saline, Lancaster II, Rice, Kentucky, <b>Purple</b> <b>Martin,</b> Idaho Canyon and many more. [...] Their biggest action came during Operation Dewey Canyon from January 22 - March 18, 1969 where the Marines sought to engage Communist forces near the Laotian border. [...] All three of the squadron's aircraft were involved with the Hueys providing gun support for 3rd Force Recon, escorting insertion, extraction, supply and MEDEVAC missions and the two fixed wing squadrons doing aerial reconnaissance, artillery spotting and forward air controlling from the air.|$|E

60|$|The great {{uniformity}} in {{the architecture}} of each species of bird which has been supposed to prove a nest-building instinct, we may, therefore, fairly impute to the uniformity of {{the conditions under which}} each species lives. Their range is often very limited, and they very seldom permanently change their country, so as to be placed in new conditions. When, however, new conditions do occur, they take advantage of them just as freely and wisely as man could do. The chimney and house-swallows are a standing proof of a change of habit since chimneys and houses were built, and in America this change has taken place within about three hundred years. Thread and worsted are now used in many nests instead of wool and horsehair, and the jackdaw shows an affection for the church steeple which can hardly be explained by instinct. In the more thickly populated parts of the United States, the Baltimore oriole uses all sorts of pieces of string, skeins of silk, or the gardener's bass, to weave into its fine pensile nest, instead of the single hairs and vegetable fibres it has painfully to seek in wilder regions; and Wilson, a most careful observer, believes that it improves in nest-building by practice--the older birds making the best nests. The <b>purple</b> <b>martin</b> takes possession of empty gourds or small boxes, stuck up for its reception in almost every village and farm in America; and several of the American wrens will also build in cigar boxes, with a small hole cut in them, if placed in a suitable situation. The orchard oriole of the United States offers us an excellent example of a bird which modifies its nest according to circumstances. When built among firm and stiff branches the nest is very shallow, but if, as is often the case, it is suspended from the slender twigs of the weeping willow, it is made much deeper, so that when swayed about violently by the wind the young may not tumble out. It has been observed also, that the nests built in the warm Southern States are much slighter and more porous in texture than those in the colder regions of the north. Our own house-sparrow equally well adapts himself to circumstances. When he builds in trees, as he, no doubt, always did originally, he constructs a well-made domed nest, perfectly fitted to protect his young ones; but when he can find a convenient hole in a building or among thatch, or in any well-sheltered place, he takes much less trouble, and forms a very loosely-built nest.|$|E
6000|$|Perhaps {{there is}} some truth in the notion that when a man dies he does not wholly die; that is to say, the earthly yet {{intelligent}} part of him, which, being of the earth, cannot ascend; that a residuum of life remains, like a perfume left by some long-vanished, fragrant object; {{or it may be}} an emanation from the body at death, which exists thereafter diffused and mixed with the elements, perhaps unconscious and yet responsive, or capable of being vivified into consciousness and emotions of pleasure by a keenly sympathetic presence. At Selborne this did not seem mere fantasy. Strolling about the village, loitering in the park-like garden of the Wakes, or exploring the Hanger; or when I sat on the bench under the churchyard yew, or went softly through the grass to look again at those two letters graved on the headstone, there was a continual sense of an unseen presence near me. It was like the sensation a man sometimes has when lying still with closed eyes of some one moving softly to his side. I began to think that if that feeling and sensation lasted long enough without diminishing its strength, it would in the end produce something like conviction. And the conviction would imply communion. Furthermore, between the thought that we may come to believe in a thing and belief itself there is practically no difference. I began to speculate as to the subjects about to be discussed by us. The chief one would doubtless relate to the bird life of the district. There are fresh things to be related of the cuckoo; how [...] "wonder has been added to wonder" [...] by observers of that bird {{since the end of the}} eighteenth century. And here is a delicate subject to follow--to wit, the hibernation of swallows--yet one by no possibility to be avoided. It would be something of a disappointment to him to hear it stated, as an established fact, that none of our hirundines do winter, fast asleep like dormice, in these islands. But there would be comfort in the succeeding declaration that the old controversy is not quite dead yet--that at least two popular writers on British birds have boldly expressed the belief that some of our supposed migrants do actually [...] "lay up" [...] in the dead season. The deep interest manifested in the subject would be a temptation to dwell on it. I should touch on the discovery made recently by a young English naturalist abroad, that a small species of swallow in a temperate country in the Southern Hemisphere shelters itself under the thick matted grass, and remains torpid during spells of cold weather. We have now a magnificent monograph of the swallows, and it is there stated of the <b>purple</b> <b>martin,</b> an American species, that in some years bitter cold weather succeeds its arrival in early spring in Canada; that at such times the birds take refuge in their nesting holes and lie huddled together in a semi-torpid state, sometimes for a week or ten days, until the return of genial weather, when they revive and appear as full of life and vigour as before. It is said that these and other swallows are possessed of habits and powers of which we have as yet but slight knowledge. Candour would compel me to add that the author of the monograph in question, who is one of the first living ornithologists, is inclined to believe that some swallows in some circumstances do hibernate.|$|E

40|$|Approximately 75 % of {{socially}} monogamous passerines pursue extra-pair mating with {{the frequency of}} extra-pair paternity varying among and within taxonomic groups. Despite the ubiquity of extra-pair mating systems, substantial research into the subject has produced mixed results and the benefits to females remain elusive. Two genetic benefits hypotheses, the good genes hypothesis and heterozygosity theory, predict that extra-pair offspring (EPO) should generally be more fit than within-pair offspring (WPO). This study aims to test for genetic-based benefits to extra-pair mating in <b>purple</b> <b>martins</b> (Progne subis) by comparing EPO and WPO. Specifically, I compare the first year survival estimates of EPO and WPO and of those offspring that are recruited into the breeding population, I compare the reproductive success of EPO and WPO. I found no differences in first-year survival probability nor did I find any differences in reproductive success between EPO and WPO. I conclude that female <b>purple</b> <b>martins</b> are not benefiting from extra-pair mating through the improved survival or reproductive success of their offspring. Such benefits may be context-dependent or historical contexts in which the benefits of extra-pair mating for females may no longer exist for this semi-domesticated species...|$|R
