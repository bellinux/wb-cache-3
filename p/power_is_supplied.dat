5|$|Electric <b>power</b> <b>is</b> <b>supplied</b> {{within the}} city by PNM Resources. PNM also {{provides}} electrical power in the Tularosa Basin, while Otero County Electric Cooperative, a member cooperative of Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association and of Touchstone Energy, serves {{other areas of the}} county. Natural gas is supplied {{within the city}} by New Mexico Gas Company. Severn Trent operates both the water and sewage treatment facilities for the City of Alamogordo. Severn Trent maintains all water storage facilities, booster pump stations, city wells and treats the waste water to be re-used by the city to water the parks, Desert Lakes Golf Course and is sold to construction companies for dust control. Rural houses have individual wells.|$|E
5|$|<b>Power</b> <b>is</b> <b>supplied</b> to {{the chip}} in 1.7 {{microsecond}} pulses {{as determined by}} the storage time of a control transistor. An oscillator clock operating at 200 kilohertz during calculations and dropping to 15 kilohertz between each operation means shut off time ranges from 3.3 microseconds during calculations to over 65 microseconds between. The device relies on the capacitance of the chips to store information when there is no power, and 1.7 microseconds proved sufficient for the chip to carry out a single change of state of the electronics. Any calculation can be done in 1000 such changes. This had the effect of extending battery life to about 20 hours of continuous use with three small hearing aid batteries, equivalent to about four months of normal usage.|$|E
5|$|Other {{utilities}} {{are provided by}} private entities or South Korean government-owned companies. Seorabeol City Gas, an affiliate of GS Group, provides gas to the Gyeongju residents, while, electrical <b>power</b> <b>is</b> <b>supplied</b> by the public enterprises, Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power via the Wolseong Nuclear Power Plant. The plant is known for the only nuclear power plant operating PHWRs (Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor) in South Korea and supplies about 5% of South Korea's electricity. The owner, Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power began to build the Wolseong 1 in the districts of Yangnam-myeon, Yangbuk-myeon and Gampo-eup in 1976. Since 1983, the power plant has been providing commercial service and operating with the PHWRs that has a capacity of 678,000kW. As the construction of each Wolseong 2, 3 and 4 with a capacity of 70,000kW were completed respectively in 1997, 1998 and 1999, Wolseong Nuclear Power plant site has been successfully operating the four PHWRs plants. New project, Sinwolseong No. 1 and No. 2 are currently under construction which {{is estimated to be}} completed until 2011–12.|$|E

25|$|Like the New York City Subway and in {{contrast}} with the London Underground the Paris Métro mostly uses two-way tunnels. As in most French métro and tramway systems, trains drive on the right (the SNCF drives on the left). The tracks are standard gauge (1.435 metres). Electric <b>power</b> <b>is</b> <b>supplied</b> by a third rail which carries 750 volts DC.|$|E
25|$|Electrical <b>power</b> <b>is</b> <b>supplied</b> {{by three}} MHW-RTG {{radioisotope}} thermoelectric generators (RTGs). They are powered by plutonium-238 (distinct from the Pu-239 isotope used in nuclear weapons) and provided approximately 470 W at 30 volts DC when the spacecraft was launched. Plutonium-238 decays with a half-life of 87.74 years, so RTGs using Pu-238 will lose {{a factor of}} 1−0.5(1/87.74) = 0.79% of their power output per year.|$|E
25|$|The New Haven's {{traction}} power system was originally constructed {{to operate at}} 11 kV, 25Hz, using power supplied by the Cos Cob Power Station. The power station was shut down around 1986 and Metro-North converted the {{traction power}} system to 60Hz operation. Traction power is converted from utility-supplied 115 kV (single phase) to 27 kV (single phase with center tap), which is distributed using an auto-transformer system. <b>Power</b> <b>is</b> <b>supplied</b> to the catenary at 12.5 kV, 60Hz.|$|E

25|$|Because the Kinect sensor's {{motorized}} {{tilt mechanism}} requires {{more power than}} the Xbox 360's USB ports can supply, the device makes use of a proprietary connector combining USB communication with additional power. Redesigned Xbox 360 S models include a special AUX port for accommodating the connector, while older models require a special power supply cable (included with the sensor) that splits the connection into separate USB and power connections; <b>power</b> <b>is</b> <b>supplied</b> from the mains by way of an AC adapter.|$|E
25|$|On simple, usually {{temporary}} layouts, <b>power</b> <b>is</b> <b>supplied</b> by a {{power pack}} {{consisting of a}} transformer and rectifier (DC), a rheostat for regulating power to the track (and thus train speed), and reversing to control model direction. On permanent layouts, multiple power supplies are traditionally used, with the trackage divided into electrically isolated sections called blocks; toggle or rotary switches (sometimes relays) are used to select which power supply controls the train in a particular block. With the advent of digital command control, block divisions are largely eliminated, as the computerized controllers can control any train anywhere on the track at any time.|$|E
500|$|Boeing {{announced}} a new 747 variant, the 747-8, on November 14, 2005. Referred to as the 747 Advanced prior to its launch, the 747-8 uses the same engine and cockpit technology as the 787, hence {{the use of the}} [...] "8". The variant is designed to be quieter, more economical, and more environmentally friendly. The 747-8's fuselage is lengthened from 232 to 251feet (70.8 to 76.4m), marking the first stretch variant of the aircraft. <b>Power</b> <b>is</b> <b>supplied</b> by General Electric GEnx-2B67 engines.|$|E
