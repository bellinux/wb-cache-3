5000|$|Zeise's salt {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{organometallic}} compounds to be reported. It was discovered by William Christopher Zeise, a professor at the University of Copenhagen, who prepared this compound in 1830 while investigating the reaction of <b>PtCl4</b> with boiling ethanol. Following careful analysis he proposed that the resulting compound contained ethylene. Justus von Liebig, a highly influential chemist of that era, often criticised Zeise's proposal, but Zeise's proposal was decisively supported in 1868 when Birnbaum prepared the complex using ethylene. Zeise's salt received a great deal of attention during the second half of the 19th century because chemists could not explain its molecular structure. This question remained unanswered until the determination of its X-ray crystal structure in the 20th century. [...] Zeise's salt stimulated much scientific research in the field of organometallic chemistry and would be key in defining new concepts in chemistry. The Dewar-Chatt-Duncanson model explains how the metal is coordinated to the C=C double bond.|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} of Cl with Pt(110) was studied in UHV by scanning tunneling microscopy, low-energy electron diffraction, temperature- programmed desorption, and DFT calculations. Up {{to half a}} monolayer (ML) of Cl forms an adsorbate structure. Compression to higher local coverages leads to erosion of Pt atoms from the top layer and formation of <b>PtCl(4)</b> pentamers. Anneating results in heating of the Pt defects and formation of a long- range-ordered <b>PtCl(4)</b> /Cl/Pt(110) adlayer that is remarkably simitar to the adtayer structure found after deposition of [PtCl(4) ](2 -) from an electrolyte onto Au(100). Coadsorption of 0. 5 ML of Cl with CO initiates <b>PtCl(4)</b> formation, but no volatile compounds are formed under these conditions.

Differing from our previous work (Zhang, H.; Jin, M. S.; Wang, J. G.; Li, W. Y.; Camargo, P. H. C.; Kim, M. J.; Yang, D. R.; Xie, Z. X.; Xia, Y. Synthesis of Pd-Pt Bimetallic Nanocrystals with a Concave Structure through a Bromide-Induced Galvanic Replacement Reaction. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2011, 133, 6078 - 6079), we complemented the galvanic replacement (between Pd nanocubes and <b>PtCl(4)</b> (2 -)) with a coreduction process (for PdCl(4) (2 -) from the galvanic reaction and <b>ptCl(4)</b> (2 -) from the feeding) to generate Pd-Pt alloy nanocages In one step. We {{found that the}} rate of galvanic replacement (as determined by the concentrations of Br(-) and <b>PtCl(4)</b> (2 -) and temperature) and the rates of coreduction (as determined by the type of reductant and temperature) played Important roles in controlling the morphology of resultant Pd-Pt alloy nanocages. The Pd-Pt nanocages exhibited both enhanced activity and selectivity for the preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO in excess hydrogen than those of Pd nanocubes and the commercial Pt/C thanks to the alloy composition and hollow structure. In addition, as the sizes of the Pd-Pt nanocages decreased, they exhibited higher CO conversion rates and lower maximum conversion temperatures due to the increase in specific surface area.

Treating the pro-ligands 3 with 3 equivalents of the bulky base KHMDS and Pd(OAc) (2) or PtCl(2) (COD) gave the four amido bis(N-heterocyclic carbene) pincer complexes [CNC-R]M-I [M = Pd (7) or Pt (8); R = i-Pr (a) or n-Bu (b) ], including the first examples of platinum complexes of a CNC ligand. The reaction of 7 a with AgOTf in pyridine gave the cationic complex {[CNC-i-Pr]Pd-py}OTf (9 a). Heating a mixture of amine mono(imidazolium) salt 6 with PdCl(2) or K(2) <b>PtCl(4),</b> K(2) CO(3) and KI in pyridine at 100 °C gave the complexes [C,NH]MI(2) py [M = Pd (10) or Pt (11) ], in which the amine arm of the NHC ligand is not deprotonated and does not coordinate to the metal. For a solution of 10 in 1, 4 -dioxane, deprotonation of the amine occurred in a biphasic reaction with aqueous KOH at 40 °C, giving the dimeric amido complex {[C,N]Pd(μ-OH) }(2) (12).
