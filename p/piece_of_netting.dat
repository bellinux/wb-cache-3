40|$|In {{response}} to {{the widespread use of}} control strategies such as Insecticide Treated Nets (ITN), Anopheles mosquitoes have evolved various resistance mechanisms. Kdr is a mutation that provides physiological resistance to the pyrethroid insecticides family (PYR). In the present study, we investigated the effect of the Kdr mutation on the ability of female An. gambiae to locate and penetrate a 1 cm-diameter hole in a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>netting,</b> either treated with insecticide or untreated, to reach a bait in a wind tunnel. Kdr homozygous, PYR-resistant mosquitoes were the least efficient at penetrating an untreated damaged net, with about 51 % [39 - 63] success rate compared to 80 % [70 - 90] and 78 % [65 - 91] for homozygous susceptible and heterozygous respectively. This reduced efficiency, likely due to reduced host- seeking activity, as revealed by mosquito video-tracking, is evidence of a recessive behavioral cost of the mutation. Kdr heterozygous mosquitoes were the most efficient at penetrating nets treated with PYR insecticide, thus providing evidence for overdominance, the rarely-described case of heterozygote advantage conveyed by a single locus. The study also highlights the remarkable capacity of female mosquitoes, whether PYR-resistant or not, to locate holes in bed-nets...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUNDIn this study, {{carried out}} on pyrethroid-resistant Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae, {{different}} combinations containing pyrethroid deltamethrin, piperonyl butoxide (PBO) synergist and six neonicotinoid insecticides (acetamiprid, nitenpyram, thiamethoxam, clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiacloprid) were tested. The bioassays were carried out by tarsal contact on impregnated paper on Ae. aegypti and with impregnated <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>netting</b> on An. gambiae. RESULTSThe combination of deltamethrin and PBO was synergistic against pyrethroid-resistant Ae. aegypti (LHP) and An. gambiae (VKPR) strains, with 43 and 57 % mortality respectively, versus 17 and 12 % with deltamethrin alone. On LHPAe. aegypti, the deltamethrin + PBO + neonicotinoid mixtures generated insecticide efficacies that were either greater (group 1) or lower (group 2) than the deltamethrin + PBO mixture. The tricomponent mixtures made with thiamethoxam, nitenpyram and thiacloprid (70. 7, 64. 9 and 55. 9 % mortality respectively) belong to group 1. Group 2 consists of mixtures made with imidacloprid, clothianidin and acetamiprid (28. 9, 32. 9 and 34. 3 % mortality respectively). The nettings impregnated with the three tricomponent mixtures of group 1 confirmed the excellent efficacy of these mixtures against An. gambiaeVKPR (87 - 89 % mortality). CONCLUSIONDeltamethrin + PBO + neonicotinoid (group 1) mixtures induce interesting, efficient synergies, most valuable {{for the management of}} mosquito resistance to insecticides.

The cod end of the trawl, which I {{have had the opportunity to}} examine on board the "Borgenes", was tied with 16 knots pr. 24 inches when new and waterproofed. A somewhat older cod end in use had 1 or 2 more knots pr. 24 inches, which proves some shrinking <b>of</b> the <b>net</b> by usage. On board the boat I procured some <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>net</b> made <b>of</b> new waterproofed twine and I found out that mesh of the size of 14 knots pr. 24 inches would allow small haddock of about 30 cm to escape. My impression is that something would be gained by the introduction of a size of mesh in the cod end of 2 - 3 knots less pr. 24 inches than the one now generally used by the British trawlers. That the limitation of the size of mesh is a step in the right direction appears correct, judging from the experiments performed by attaching a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> fine meshed <b>net</b> to the bag of the trawl. This has not only been tried during the investigations of S/S "Borgenes" last winter, but in addition several times on the cruises of "Michael Sars" during previous years.

40|$|International audienceTo gain {{a better}} {{understanding}} of the fluid-structure interaction and especially when dealing with a flow around an arbitrarily moving body, it is essential to develop measurement tools enabling the instantaneous detection of moving deformable interface during the flow measurements. A particularly useful application is the determination of unsteady turbulent flow velocity field around a moving porous fishing net structure which is of great interest for selectivity and also for the numerical code validation which needs a realistic database. To do this, a representative <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> fishing <b>net</b> structure is used to investigate both the Turbulent Boundary layer (TBL) developing over the horizontal porous moving fishing net structure and the turbulent flow passing through the moving porous structure. For such an investigation, Time Resolved PIV measurements are carried out and combined with a motion tracking technique allowing the measurement of the instantaneous motion of the deformable fishing net during PIV measurements. Once the two-dimensional motion of the porous structure is accessed, PIV velocity measurements are analyzed in connection with the detected motion. Finally, the TBL is characterized and the effect of the structure motion on the volumetric flow rate passing though the moving porous structure is clearly demonstrated...|$|R
