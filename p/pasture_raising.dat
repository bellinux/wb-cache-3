40|$|Comparing Soil Characteristics under Various Land Cover in Kentucky and Illinois B. Chadwick, B. Webster, J. Clark, M. Mercer, I. P. Handayani, and B. Parr Murray State University, Hutson School of Agriculture, Kentucky, USA Abstract Over time, {{managing}} different crops {{has caused}} soils {{to change their}} characteristics. The study includes a comparison between soils found in five different locations. Using the bulk density, water holding capacity, soil organic matter, soil pH, soil water content at field capacity, and soil porosity, this study aims to distinguish how continuously using the same cropping systems will affect soils {{over an extended period}} of time. Soil samples were collected from Christian County, Kentucky, Caldwell County, Kentucky, Calloway County, Kentucky, and Madison County, Illinois on August 29 th 2017. The soil samples collected include silt loams and sandy silt loams that are in use for horse <b>pasture,</b> <b>raising</b> dark tobacco, conservation reserve program, gardening, and a park. From each location, three undisturbed soil samples and three disturbed samples were taken from the depth interval of 0 to 6. 5 cm. The results show that the growth of different plants species can alter soil physical and chemical conditions under different cropping systems. The detail results and further discussion of this study will described in the poster. In general, the change of soil characteristics due to continuous cultivation was positive and negative depending on the type of land cover.

50|$|Risk {{of organic}} swine {{diseases}} can be high depending on geographic region, breeds, and farmer management. If those conditions are met, certain risks of parasites can affect swine herds.

40|$|The {{cattle market}} has {{drastically}} {{changed over the}} last half century. Today, ranchers and farmers are faced with various governmental regulations as well as fluctuating grain and fuel prices. While beef may still be a commodity, it can be sold in specialized markets, in markets that have enhanced consumer demand. It is nearly impossible for a producer with a small herd to compete with a larger ranch if they are selling their cattle as a commodity. The primary economic objective of the producer is to generate revenue. Producers must be profitable to remain in business {{as well as provide}} a livelihood for their family. Providing a quality product is part of the business model. Choice within a marketplace is beneficial for producers and consumers. That said forage-fed beef will prosper in marketplaces where consumers desire their product more than alternate products.

Instead of moving lactating cows to summer <b>pastures</b> <b>raising</b> replacement heifers recently gained much importance. Here, we analysed {{the impact of these}} changes in dairy farming on butterfly diversity inhabiting Alpine summer pastures in the eastern Italian Alps. We sampled butterflies (Lepidoptera) in 16 Alpine summer pastures that were either grazed by lactating cows (n = 11) or replacement heifers (n = 5) at two distances from the farm building. Butterflies were classified according to their mobility. Our results showed a distance effect on total butterfly species richness only in pastures grazed by lactating cows indicating a stronger impact on vegetation structure and composition nearby the farm building. Abundance of butterflies was higher with increasing distance from the farm building. In contrast to mobile butterflies, sedentary species reacted more strongly to disturbance induced by grazing livestock. Moreover, butterfly composition differed slightly between pastures grazed by lactating cows and heifers. Our results indicate that the widespread adoption of heifer grazing induces a shift in butterfly diversity and composition likely caused by the different behaviour of grazing livestock. In order to benefit butterfly diversity in Alpine summer pastures, we suggest that future agri-environment schemes should provide extra support for summer farming of lactating cows...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The equine {{chorionic}} gonadotropin (eCG) is a glycoprotein {{produced in}} mare endometrial calices. In bovine, {{it is used}} in estrus synchronization protocols. However, {{studies have shown that}} it is potentially immunogenic and its effect can decrease after repetitive use. This study aimed to evaluate antral follicle dynamics, corpus luteum (CL) and ovulation rate in bos indicus cows submitted to an estrus synchronization protocol in association with eCG for eight times consecutively. Ten cyclical, multiparous, and <b>pasture</b> <b>raised</b> beef cows were divided into two groups: control group (n= 5) and eCG group (n= 5). In 30 day interval, all animals were synchronized with the same estrogen/progesterone based protocol, totalizing 8 re-synchronizations. Cows in the treatment group received 300 IU eCG 48 hours prior to the presumable ovulation. Ultrassound examinations were performed on Day 4 of the protocol (approximately 1. 5 days after follicle recruitment) to count antral follicles, on Day 10, to count antral follicles and to measure size of the largest follicle and on Day 18 to measure the diameter of the CL. No difference (P> 0. 05) between follicular growth and size of the pre-ovulatory follicle was reported between groups. Cows treated with eCG had a larger (P< 0. 05) CL and increased (P< 0. 05) ovulation rate (18 mm and 92 %, respectively) when compared with control group (14. 1 mm and 80 %, respectively).

A total 150 males and females birds were distributed in a completely randomized design with three treatments (0, 10 and 20 % acerola meal) and five replicates. The productive performance was assessed by weighing the feed and poultry. After 87 days the birds were slaughtered and their intestinal measured portions and certain the carcass yield and its composition: the percentage of the main cuts of meat, the viscera and abdominal fat. Later carcasses were sampled and analyzed for texture, color and breast samples were collected for sensory analysis. The results demonstrate that the inclusion of 10 % flour acerola to the diet of the birds did not alter the performance parameters, but there was a decrease in carcass yield of birds that consumed the product, tested in two levels of supplementation. The biometric evaluation demonstrated that the use of acerola flour duodenum stimulated the development of the poultry, and consequently, the total length of the intestine. The addition of the acerola flour in the diet of the birds did not affect the color, texture, flavor and appearance of meat.

40|$|Intensive {{reindeer}} grazing and {{the increase}} of other land use forms have caused {{a decline in the}} amount of arboreal (Alectoria, Bryoria spp.) and reindeer (Cladina spp.) lichens in the Finnish reindeer management area during the last few decades. Supplementary feeding of reindeer has increasingly compensated for the lack of natural winter fodder. The amount of the supplementary feeding and {{the quantity and quality of}} summer pastures should therefore have an increasing effect on the productivity of reindeer stock. In order to outline better the present carrying capacity problems on pastures in the Finnish reindeer management area we focused some of the most important productivity factors of Finnish reindeer stock from 1993 to 1999. The results showed that the productivity of reindeer stock in Finland was dependent especially on two main elements: amount of reindeer feeding and reindeer densities on summer pastures. Winter pastures had no clear effect on productivity when analysing the entire management area. High productivity figures in reindeer stock (calf production, carcass mass and meat production per reindeer) were reached in the management districts where winter feeding was the most abundant, reindeer densities relatively low and summer pastures abundant. An increase in reindeer density on summer <b>pastures</b> <b>raised</b> meat production per total summer pasture area but decreased carcass mass of reindeer calves and meat production per reindeer. It seems that the fundamental factor for keeping the reindeer stock productivity sustainable at a high enough level is to optimize the longterm reindeer densities on pastures. Summer pastures may gradually become a limiting factor for reindeer stock productivity in some areas if overgrazed and decreased winter pastures are only compensated for by winter feeding of reindeer.  </p...|$|R
