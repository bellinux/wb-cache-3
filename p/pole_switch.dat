40|$|Electrical {{contact is}} an {{important}} parameter for the reliability of electrical devices. Due to the limitation of optical imaging, methods available for the contact measurement characteristics are only suitable for open or transparent systems. For most of the practical situations that require contact measurement characteristics in non-transparent or enclosed systems, the traditional methods are not effective. Based upon these requirements, a method suitable for the electrical contact characteristics in non-transparent systems is developed by using X-ray computer tomography (CT). The main advantage of this visualisation method {{is the ability to}} acquire three-dimensional (3 D) views of systems keeping the features intact. In this work, the method is demonstrated by measuring the contact area and the average contact angle in each contact spot which is held between the conductors of 16 A AC single <b>pole</b> <b>switch</b> after two different current tests (0 and 16 A AC).

The “ 3 D Contact Map” of an electrical contact interface is presented demonstrating the 3 D nature of the contact. It gives information on where the electrical contact spots in a 3 D surface profile are located. An X-ray Computer Tomography (CT) technique is used to collect the 3 D data to a resolution of around 5 μm of a real un-dismantled contact interface for analysis.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is the development and application of a software tool to support an Assembly Line Balancing problem, minimizing the number of stations used to allocate the elementary operations identified in the whole process, in accordance with an assigned cycle time. The assembly phase {{has always been one}} of the most critical one within the entire cycle of the product realization, therefore, has led many companies to search for the best methods for solving balancing problems. In this paper the problem is dealt with five different algorithms: Largest Candidate Rule, Most Following Task, Ranked Positional Weight, Kilbridge & Wester, Kottas Lau, all implemented both in the case of a “single model” line which in the case of a “mixed-model” line. To solve the problem, therefore, in this thesis it was decided to use an Excel spreadsheet, which automating the largest possible number of calculations also allows us to solve problems with a higher number of transactions.

40|$|Radio-frequency (RF) {{switches}} {{are widely}} used in electrical systems, telecommunications, and wireless applications. In RF systems, it is often desirable to change the signal path effectively, by us-ing couplers, duplexers, and RF switches for signal division and combining. Typically, in modern RF systems, the RF switch is mostly capitalized {{in order to reduce}} the RF footprint but with efficient switch characteristics. A simple method to reduce transceiver space requirement is to integrate RF switches with the frontend module on a single chip. Recent advances in Gallium Nitride (GaN) technology allows RF designers to design faster, smaller, and efficient components using this technology. With high data rates in demand for wireless communication systems, wideband characteristics are needed in modern systems [1]. Therefore, it is desirable to design wideband circuits; such as, mixers, amplifiers, and switches. In this work, a comprehensive study of NRC GaN 150 HEMT is conducted to design broadband RF switches. Single pole and double <b>pole</b> <b>switch</b> topologies operating at 1 - 12 GHz are designed to evaluate GaN 0. 15 μm RF switches. The main objectives were to design compact sized switches, while having high power handling, low insertion loss, high isolation and high return loss. Additionally, a transmit-receive switch is designed for integration into a frontend module and further fabricated to operate at 10 GHz. There are many applications of RF switches in an RF transceiver, one of which is an impedance tuner. Impedance tuner are attractive for many applications where mobile devices are used for wireless communications. As mobile technology continues to evolve, they are designed to be com-pact, leaving minimal space for the antenna. Consequently, the radiating element is often electrically small and sensitive to near-field coupling requiring tuning. Matching networks aim to tune matching conditions; for example, loading effects due to human hand [2]. For such situations, specialized matching networks can be designed to account for specific loading environmental effects. However, for mobile systems, the environment is unknown; thereby, yielding unpredictable antenna loading, especially for electrically small antennas that have rapidly changing real and imaginary impedance. As a result, it is necessary to design a reconfigurable impedance-matching network to account for possible load impedances. In this work, a 16 -bit reconfigurable impedance tuner design comprising of passive microwave components and NRC GaN 0. 15 μm FET operating at X-band is presented to evaluate its performance for integration with the frontend module on a single chip to reduce cost and increase efficiency of the system...|$|E

40|$|Harmonics {{elimination}} Pulse-width modulation (HEPWM) originally {{proposed by}} Patel and Hoft [1], {{is a method}} to eliminate (specific) selected harmonics from the PWM waveform spectra. It {{has been seen as}} a viable alternative to the more widely used sinusoidal PWM (SPWM) method. The technique has been recognized to reduce harmonic losses, radio frequency interference, torque pulsations, speed ripples, etc. The main impetus for using HEPWM is that for a given inverter switching frequency, the incidence of the first non eliminated harmonic is almost double that for SPWM scheme. This results in a far superior <b>pole</b> <b>switching</b> waveform harmonic spectrum. As a result, about 50 % reduction in the inverter switching frequency is achievable. The reduction in the switching frequency contributes to the reduction in the switching losses which is advantageous for high power converter applications. Furthermore, it is possible to obtain a much higher <b>pole</b> <b>switching</b> waveform fundamental amplitude before the minimum pulse-width limit of the inverter is reached. This fact, coupled with the ability to operate in the overmodulation region allows for higher utilization of the DC link voltage. Due to the high quality of the output voltage and current, the ripple in the dc link current is also small. Thus, a reduction {{in the size of the}} dc link filter components is achieved. Despite the above-mentioned prominent advantages there is one particular problem that has prevented the use of HEPWM in many drive and power converter industries, namely the equations to calculate switching angles in a HEPWM scheme are non-linear and transcendental. As a result, they cannot be solved online by a microprocessor. Normally, an off-line numerical technique had to be sought. However such operation requires large computational power and with a large number of possibilities of modulation index, ratio, and the interpolation involved, the memory requirement can be very large. Besides the off-line method suggested in [1], there exist several methods to generate on-line HEPWM waveforms. The most prominent of such work was published by Taufiq et. al. [2]. They derived a set of nontranscendental equations for near-optimal solution using sine-wave approximation approach. Using this scheme, the transcendental equations are “reduced” to a simpler form which permits on-line HEPWM computation using digital methods. Another scheme, based on regular sampled PWM technique was suggested by Bowes [3]. Other works are mostly based on pre-calculated angles which are stored in memory. These are referred to as preprogrammed harmonic elimination method. Reference [4] provides excellent review of this technique. This Chapter proposes a new method of near-optimal harmonics elimination based on quadratic-approximated equations. It is envisaged that the proposed method permits even faster and more efficient on-line, real-time computations using a microprocessor due to the simplicity of the algorithm...|$|R
