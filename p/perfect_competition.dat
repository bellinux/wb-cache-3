50|$|According to {{economics}} professor Timothy Van Zandt, there exist two models of strategic competition: competition in quantities between firms producing <b>perfect</b> substitutes and <b>competition</b> between firms producing substitute goods by price.|$|R
25|$|Neither labor nor {{capital has}} the power to affect prices or factor rates by {{constraining}} supply; a state of <b>perfect</b> <b>competition</b> exists.|$|E

25|$|Since the Bertrand model {{assumes that}} firms compete on price and not output quantity, it predicts that a duopoly {{is enough to}} push prices down to {{marginal}} cost level, meaning that a duopoly will result in <b>perfect</b> <b>competition.</b>|$|E

50|$|Firms {{operating}} as monopolies or in imperfect competition face downward-sloping demand curves. To sell extra units of output, {{they would have}} to lower their output's price. Under such market conditions, marginal revenue product will not equal MPP×Price. This is because the firm is not able to sell output at a fixed price per unit. Thus the MRP curve of a firm in monopoly or in imperfect competition will slope downwards, when plotted against labor usage, at a faster rate than in <b>perfect</b> specific <b>competition.</b>|$|R

25|$|Economists {{disagree}} {{as to the}} measurable {{impact of}} minimum wages in practice.

25|$|Note {{that there}} are some {{assumptions}} and requirements that have to be fulfilled for the latter to be correct: There must be <b>perfect</b> <b>competition</b> in the market, and the total number of factors may never surpass the total number of assets (in order to avoid the problem of matrix singularity).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} dynamic two-region model with human capital accumulation. This {{economic}} system {{is assumed to}} produce two commodities - one in each region. The only university in the economy which carries out higher education (=teaching) is located in region 1. The model describes the dynamic interdependence between human capital accumulation, regional division of labour, the spatial price structure under <b>perfect</b> economic <b>competition,</b> and the government intervention in higher education. Thus the analysis examines how differences in human capital improvements and environmental conditions between the two regions affect the economic geography. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} impact of {{vertical}} integration when a monopolistic producer can make a capital commitment before deciding on output. For the vertically separated industry structure, we find that opportunism resulting from competition between retailers leads to a longrun underinvestment in capital. With vertical integration, the capital investment is efficient but output is monopolistically restricted. We show that welfare may be higher with vertical integration. While the previous literature {{has pointed out that}} intra- and inter-brand <b>competition</b> are <b>perfect</b> substitutes, this does not hold in our model as <b>perfect</b> inter-brand <b>competition</b> leads to the first-best allocation...|$|R

25|$|A supply {{schedule}} is a table {{that shows the}} relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied. Under the assumption of <b>perfect</b> <b>competition,</b> supply is determined by marginal cost. That is, firms will produce additional output while the cost of producing an extra unit of output is less than the price they would receive.|$|E
25|$|In {{perfectly}} competitive markets {{studied in}} the theory of supply and demand, there are many producers, none of which significantly influence price. Industrial organization generalizes from that special case to study the strategic behaviour of firms that do have significant control of price. It considers the structure of such markets and their interactions. Common market structures studied besides <b>perfect</b> <b>competition</b> include monopolistic competition, various forms of oligopoly, and monopoly.|$|E
50|$|Depending on the {{homogeneity}} of demand, the lump-sum fee charged varies, but the rational firm {{will set the}} per unit charge above or equal to the marginal cost of production, and below or equal to the price the firm would charge in a <b>perfect</b> monopoly. Under <b>competition</b> the per-unit price is set below marginal cost.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a model where N {{strategic}} informed traders who are endowed with heterogeneous noisy signals with different precisions {{compete in a}} market with a single risky asset. We explicitly describe the unique linear equilibrium that exists in this setup and derive its properties. Moreover, {{we focus on the}} effects of noise on the competition between traders. We show that noise softens the competition between traders. In particular, for N exceeding three and for certain sets of noise in traders' signals, each trader's individual profit is greater than the one obtained in the case of <b>perfect</b> information. <b>Competition</b> Optimal noise Price manipulation...|$|R

25|$|Prices and {{quantities}} {{have been}} described as the most directly observable attributes of goods produced and exchanged in a market economy. The theory of supply and demand is an organizing principle for explaining how prices coordinate the amounts produced and consumed. In microeconomics, it applies to price and output determination for a market with <b>perfect</b> <b>competition,</b> which includes the condition of no buyers or sellers large enough to have price-setting power.|$|E
25|$|In many areas, {{some form}} of price {{stickiness}} is postulated to account for quantities, rather than prices, adjusting {{in the short run}} to changes on the demand side or the supply side. This includes standard analysis of the business cycle in macroeconomics. Analysis often revolves around causes of such price stickiness and their implications for reaching a hypothesized long-run equilibrium. Examples of such price stickiness in particular markets include wage rates in labour markets and posted prices in markets deviating from <b>perfect</b> <b>competition.</b>|$|E
25|$|Like <b>perfect</b> <b>{{competition}},</b> under {{monopolistic competition}} also, the firms can enter or exit freely. The firms will enter when the existing firms are making super-normal profits. With {{the entry of}} new firms, the supply would increase which would reduce the price and hence the existing firms will be left only with normal profits. Similarly, if the existing firms are sustaining losses, some of the marginal firms will exit. It will reduce the supply due to which price would rise and the existing firms will be left only with normal profit.|$|E

40|$|The course {{begins with}} {{introductory}} topics in microeconomics: {{the analysis of}} individual economic decision-making units, such as firms and households, and the market in which they exchange goods and services. We examine several market structures: <b>perfect</b> competition,monopolistic <b>competition,</b> monopoly, and oligopoly, before briefly discussing scenarios in which markets may fail, {{such as in the}} presence of externalities. We then turn to macroeconomics: the study of the economy as a whole. Focusing on the United States, we will survey topics such as unemployment, inflation, growth, and the tools used by governments to impact the economy. We will also discuss the role of monetary policyin trying to control inflation while encouraging robust economic growth...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, several models (<b>perfect</b> or {{imperfect}} <b>competition,</b> flexible or fix-price models) for {{the determination}} of the level and of the price of exports of manufactured goods are developed and estimated. A special interest is given to the link between the situation (price level and level of demand) on the domestic market and the volume and price of exports, and to the degree of flexibility of prices. ...|$|R
25|$|When {{the amount}} of one factor of {{production}} increases, {{the production of the}} good that uses that particular production factor intensively increases relative to the increase in the factor of production, as the H–O model assumes <b>perfect</b> <b>competition</b> where price is equal to the costs of factors of production. This theorem is useful in explaining the effects of immigration, emigration, and foreign capital investment. However, Rybczynski suggests that a fixed quantity of the two factors of production are required. This could be expanded to consider factor substitution, in which case the increase in production is more than proportional.|$|E
25|$|Commentators {{also point}} out that, even if the ruling's Lochner era legal {{analysis}} is appropriate and correctly applied, Mackay Radio is flawed due to the economic assumptions the Court made. Justice Roberts' opinion assumed <b>perfect</b> <b>competition</b> in labor markets, a lack of monopsony, no statistical discrimination, no information asymmetry, market rationality, and a legal regime which provided {{a level playing field}} and equal protection under the law. Some—and possibly all—of these assumptions are incorrect. Worse, however, the Mackay Radio decision fashioned strong incentives which made it rational for one bargainer (management) to refuse to cooperate and opt out of bargaining.|$|E
25|$|In {{the world}} of {{practical}} policy-making as opposed to economics as an academic discipline, the monetarist experiments in both the US and the UK in the early 1980s were the pinnacle of anti-Keynesian {{and the rise of}} <b>perfect</b> <b>competition</b> influence. The strong form of monetarism being tested at this time asserted that fiscal policy is of no effect, and that monetary policy should only try to target the money supply to control inflation, without attempting to target real interest rates. This was in contrast to the Keynesian view that monetary policy should target interest rates, which it held could influence unemployment.|$|E
40|$|Whenever the {{information}} is imperfect and markets incomplete, {{which is to say}} always, and especially in developing countries, then the invisible hand works most imperfectly…. The market system requires clearly established property rights and the courts to enforce them; but often these are absent in developing countries.

40|$|We {{develop a}} method for {{estimating}} the rivalness of tax bases using the structures of the conditional logit, Poisson, and nested logit models. As an illustration, we apply this method to estimate the effect of state-level capital taxation on U. S. inward foreign direct investment (FDI). The assumption of perfect nonrivalness can in some cases be rejected, but the assumption of <b>perfect</b> rivalness cannot. <b>Competition</b> over FDI across U.

40|$|In this paper, {{we explore}} a simple model {{which focuses on}} the joint role of workers' {{heterogeneity}} and imperfect competition in the endogeneous formation of labor market equilibria. We show that, compared to the competitive case, imperfect competition leads to a misallocation of workers and to an increase {{of the level of}} unemployment when the population is heterogeneous. When workers are all identical, competitive and Nash allocations become the same. <b>perfect</b> versus imperfect <b>competition</b> in the labor market; heterogeneous versus homogeneous workers...|$|R
