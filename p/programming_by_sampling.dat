40|$|The {{allocation}} of buffers in flow lines with stochastic processing times {{is an important}} decision {{in the design of}} production systems. The aim is to minimize the overall number of buffer capacities obtaining at least a goal production rate. We derive a mixed integer <b>program</b> <b>by</b> <b>sampling</b> the effective processing times. The computation time with standard solvers becomes very long. To reduce the computation time, a Benders Decomposition approach is developed. The master problem contains the binary variables of the original MIP and the subproblem contains the real-valued decision variables only. Cuts are iteratively derived from the subproblem and added to the master problem such that optimality is proven at the termination. This paper discusses different cuts that influence the performance of the algorithm. Numerical experiments are carried out in order to evaluate these influences...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{consider}} competitive strategy choices of Turkish manufacturing firms operating in EU markets and their action programs in responding to emerging opportunities and threats led by recent developments in Turkey-EU relations. Drawing on a sample of 79 large size Turkish manufacturing firms, the relative use of competitive strategies and action <b>programs</b> <b>by</b> <b>sample</b> firms operating in EU markets was examined by undertaking both descriptive and multivariate statistical analyses. The most heavily used competitive strategy choices were found to be growth strategies aiming to extend current product lines with related products through enabling standardization and technology sharing. The highest ranked action <b>programs</b> implemented <b>by</b> Turkish manufacturing firms focused on enabling integration. The findings of the study indicated that the relative use of competitive strategy options varied to a certain extent between the market entry modes of Turkish firms (equity based and non-equity based) serving the EU markets. However, no variation was found between the implementation level of action programs and the choice of a particular market entry mode <b>by</b> <b>sample</b> firms. While the variation in the implementation level of several of the competitive strategies appears to be readily justifiable, the reason for the variation is not always clear. It is also necessary to extend the analysis to consider the relative use of strategy options and action programs along with other variables, such as the governance and transaction cost variables. Based on a sample of large size manufacturing firms, this study is the first attempt to identify, classify and explain the key competitive strategy choices and action <b>programs</b> implemented <b>by</b> Turkish firms in EU markets...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Data {{locality}} optimization plays {{a significant}} role in reducing the execution time of many loop-intensive kernels. Loop tiling at various levels is often used to effectively exploit data locality in deep memory hierarchies. The recent development of frameworks for parametric loop tiling of user code has lead to a widening of the range of applications that could benefit from auto-tuning of tile sizes. Current model-driven approaches suffer from limitations, such as the inability to accurately model the complex interplay between multiple hardware components that affect performance. Auto-tuning libraries such as ATLAS rely on extensive empirical search for tile size optimization, which {{has been shown to be}} very effective. However, the effectiveness of such approaches for arbitrary parametrically tiled user code has not been demonstrated. We consider the problem of selecting the best tile sizes for arbitrary user-defined <b>programs,</b> <b>by</b> <b>sampling</b> in the full space of tile sizes. We have developed a technique to build a performance predictor associated with a specific program. Our approach uses statistical machine learning to train an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the performance distribution of execution time for scientific kernels. We show how this search strategy significantly improves over the variability of random search. Our observations and results on various kernels also show promise for the use of ANNs in predicting the runtime behavior for variations of tiling configurations. ...|$|R

These programs are written in standard FORTRAN 77 and are designed to run on the NSESCC IBM 3081 (MVS) computer. Because of the experimental nature of these programs they are tailored to the geographical area analyzed.

The objective {{of this article is}} to describe the framework that is being created for REDD+ under the UNFCCC to identify the potential inclusion of local information produced through community-based monitoring (CBM) into monitoring systems for REDD+. National systems could use different sources of information from CBM: first, local information can be produced as part of public <b>programs</b> <b>by</b> increasing <b>sample</b> size of national or regional inventories; second, government can collect information to produce carbon estimates from on-going management practices implemented at local level driven by access to local direct benefits (e. g., forest management plans, watershed conservation); third, national data systems could include information from projects participating in carbon markets and other certification schemes; and finally information will be produced as part of the activities associated to the implementation of social and environmental safeguards.

40|$|The {{allocation}} of buffer space in flow lines with stochastic processing times {{is an important}} decision, as buffers influence the performance of these lines. The objective of this problem is to minimize {{the overall number of}} buffer spaces achieving at least one given goal production rate. We solve this problem with a mixed-integer <b>programming</b> (MIP) approach <b>by</b> <b>sampling</b> the effective processing times. To obtain robust results, large sample sizes are required. These incur large models and long computation times using standard solvers. One approach to reduce the computation time is Benders Decomposition.

The cuts are derived from the subproblem and are added to the master problem such that optimality is proven at the termination.

40|$|This paper applies {{established}} {{techniques for}} concurrent programming in Haskell {{to the case}} of Concurrent Quantum Programming. The foundation of the approach is an extension to Concurrent Quantum Programming of the technique of “virtual values ” proposed by Amr Sabry for quantum programming in Haskell. The basic idea is to encapsulate quantum values within MVars, the monadic variables that support thread synchronization and mutually exclusive accesses to shared references. In this way, quantum processes can be concurring to have access to quantum values and we will be applying the now established quantum programming paradigm of “control is classic, data is quantum ” to the concurrent and distributed quantum programming domain: the case in focus is that the control of concurrency is classical control, while shared data between quantum processes are quantum data.

Poten-tial viewers know the earlier program but are uncertain about the later one. The TV station may air a fully informative tune-in {{during the first}} program. The cost of the tune-in is the forgone advertising revenue. The viewers may learn the later program through a tune-in, if any, if they watch the earlier <b>program,</b> or <b>by</b> directly <b>sampling</b> {{it for a few}} minutes. Under mild conditions, there exists a unique perfect Bayesian equi-librium in which some viewers watch the first program just {{to see if there is}} a tune-in or not, and the TV station airs a tune-in unless the two programs are too dissimilar. In the absence of a tune-in, no viewer within the first-period audience keeps watching TV. Full information disclosure never arises. The market outcome is suboptimal; a social planner would air a tune-in for a wider range of programs. When the programs are also quality-differentiated, the willingness to air a tune-in, and thus to disclose location information, may be sufficient to signal high quality without any dissipative advertising...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Gaussian {{processes}} are {{the cornerstone of}} statistical analysis in many application areas. Nevertheless, most of the applications are limited by their {{need to use the}} Cholesky factorization in the computation of the likelihood. In this work, we present a matrix-free approach for computing the solution of the maximum likelihood problem involving Gaussian processes. The approach is based on a stochastic <b>programming</b> reformulation followed <b>by</b> <b>sample</b> average approximation applied to either the maximization problem or its optimality conditions. We provide statistical estimates of the approximate solution. The method is illustrated on several examples where the data is provided on a regular or irregular grid. In the latter case, the action of a covariance matrix on a vector is computed by means of fast multipole methods. For each of the examples presented, we demonstrate that the approach scales linearly with {{an increase in the number}} of sites. Key words.

40|$|Source code author {{identification}} {{deals with}} identifying {{the most likely}} author of a computer program, given a set of predefined author candidates. There are several scenarios where digital evidence of this kind {{plays a role in}} investigation and adjudication, such as code authorship disputes, intellectual property infringement, tracing the source of code left in the system after a cyber attack, and so forth. As in any identification task, the disputed program is compared to undisputed, known <b>programming</b> <b>samples</b> <b>by</b> the predefined author candidates. We present a new approach, called the SCAP (Source Code Author Profiles) approach, based on byte-level n-gram profiles representing the source code author’s style. The SCAP method extends a method originally applied to natural language text authorship attribution; we show that an n-gram approach also suits the characteristics of source code analysis. The methodological extension includes a simplified profile and a less complicated, but more effective, similarity measure. Experiments on data sets of different programming-language (Java or C++) and commented/commentless code demonstrate the effectiveness of these extensions. The SCAP approach is programming-language independent. Moreover, the SCAP approach deals surprisingly well with cases where only a limited amount of very shor...|$|R

Affective outcomes, such as motivation, attitude and anxiety, were examined using Gardner 2 ̆ 7 s Attitudes and Motivational Test Battery (AMTB) survey and a student demographic questionnaire. Quantitative data from the student demographic survey reported that the typical foreign language student surveyed is female, {{between the ages of}} 18 - 22, a junior, a liberal arts major with non-native fluency in the target language. The typical study abroad <b>program</b> attended <b>by</b> this <b>sample</b> is: short-term (less than eight weeks), most often 5 - 6 weeks in duration, a language and culture program with 10 - 16 hours of instruction per week. Quantitative data from the AMTB survey reported that SA students had a higher motivation index than the non-SA participants. The attitude index did not show a statistical difference between the SA group and the non-SA group. Anxiety, however, was found to be significantly lower in the SA students when compared to that of their non-SA counterparts.
