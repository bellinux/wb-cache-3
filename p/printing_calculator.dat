5000|$|This {{input method}} first became popular with {{accountants}} paper tape adding machines. It generally makes {{the assumption that}} entered numbers are being summed, although other operations are supported. Each number entered is followed by its sign (+/-), and a running total is kept.

TenKey input mode is available in <b>printing</b> <b>calculators</b> from companies such as Sharp, and in software calculators like Judy's TenKey [...] used by accounting firms.

40|$|Product family design {{optimization}} {{is an important}} decision task {{in the early stages}} of product development. The extant optimization models for product family design assume that the known information for modeling can be determined precisely. However, many collected information for product design are prone to be imprecise due to the inherent uncertainty of human knowledge and expression. For example, when human experts estimate market demand of a product, imprecise information may be involved and influence the results of optimization. In this research, an optimization model with maximizing imprecise part-worth utility function is established for product family design problem. A linear programming embedded genetic algorithm is proposed to solve the proposed fuzzy optimization model. An industrial case of <b>printing</b> <b>calculator</b> product is used to illustrate the proposed approach. Experiments and sensitivity analysis based on the case study are also performed to analyze the relationship among the parameters and to explore the characteristics of the optimization model.

40|$|Optimisation {{of product}} family design has been {{emphasised}} and studied for many years. However, previous studies only took overall cost or profit as an optimisation objective, but ignored the supply {{risk of a}} product family. Moreover, the discount associated with the bidding price, which is common in practice, was not considered in the modelling. In this paper, we propose a new multi-objective optimisation approach integrating supplier selection into product family design. In our optimisation model, not only the profit but also the supply risk of a product family is formulated as optimisation objectives. Consequently, we can evaluate and optimise a product family from many perspectives. In addition, as a bidding price discount may affect product family’s configuration and supplier selection, we include linear piecewise discount of bidding prices from suppliers in our optimisation model. The NSGA-II algorithm is developed to achieve Pareto non-dominated solutions of the multi-objective optimisation model. Sensitivity analysis on the model parameters is performed, and several managerial insights for enterprises are achieved in the case study of a <b>printing</b> <b>calculator</b> product.

5000|$|It {{is usually}} called a <b>printing</b> {{programmable}} <b>calculator</b> or desktop calculator because {{three years later}} the Hewlett-Packard 9100A, a model that took inspiration from the P101, was advertised by HP as a [...] "portable calculator", in order to overcome wariness regarding investment in computers {{and be able to}} sell it to corporations without passing through the corporate computer department.|$|R
25|$|From {{the early}} 1900s through the 1960s, {{mechanical}} calculators dominated the desktop computing market (see History of computing hardware). Major suppliers in the USA included Friden, Monroe, and SCM/Marchant. (Some comments about European calculators follow below.) These devices were motor-driven, and had movable carriages where results of calculations were displayed by dials. Nearly all keyboards were full — each digit {{that could be}} entered had its own column of nine keys, 1..9, plus a column-clear key, permitting entry of several digits at once. (See the illustration below of a Marchant Figurematic.)One could call this parallel entry, by way of contrast with ten-key serial entry that was commonplace in mechanical adding machines, and is now universal in electronic calculators. (Nearly all Friden calculators, {{as well as some}} rotary (German) Diehls had a ten-key auxiliary keyboard for entering the multiplier when doing multiplication.) Full keyboards generally had ten columns, although some lower-cost machines had eight. Most machines made by the three companies mentioned did not print their results, although other companies, such as Olivetti, did make <b>printing</b> <b>calculators.</b>|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three parts, the first, theoretical, the second, experimental and the third, discussion of the experimental results and their significance. The theoretical part begins with a critical discussion {{of the significance of}} various potentials, electrostatic and electrochemical, used in describing the structure of the electrical double layer. The thermodynamics of interface is then outlined and the concept of surface-exess used by Gibba is examined in detail. The adsorption isotherm applicable to interface when both charged and uncharged species are present is derived using the principle of electrochemical equilibrium as originated by Gibba and developed by suggenheim. The thermodynamics of electro capillary are then examined with reference to mercury/methonolic solution interface which is proposed to be studied. The basic electro capillary equation applicable to this system is derived in a form in which only chemical potentials of electrically neutral combinations occur. Special cases of this equation, applicable to the determination of components of charge at the mercury/methanol interface are deduced with emphasis on the importance of considering, the reference electrode {{as an integral part of}} the system. The thermodynamics of non-polarisable systems is also briefly discussed and the possible influence of curvature on electro capillary is examined. Methods of evaluating components of charge by electrical and thermodynamic methods are examined for their suitability. The theory of the electrical double layer in aqueous solutions in presence of specific adsorption is discussed critically from the point of view of the ideal ionic double layer in aqueous solutions. Departure from ideal behavior is discussed in terms of specific adsorption of anions and cations from the salvation-desolvation angle. Structure of the electrical double layer in aqueous solutions in presence of specific adsorption is discussed critically from the viewpoint of fine structure of the compact layer, specific adsorption isotherms and the discreteness of charge-effector Esin and Markov effect. The isotherm derived by Levins, et al. is examined in detail and shown to be mathematically inconsistent and to be contradictory to the experimentally established facts of specific adsorption. The phenomenon of “humps” is examined with respect to the possible role of solvent. The importance of the study of non-aqueous systems as such and in understanding the nature of humps outlined. The methanol system is recommended as a suitable non-aqueous system for systematic study with the view to elucidating the structure of electrical double layer. In the experimental part, the technique of differential capacity measurements on solid metals in contact with anhydrous ionic solution in methanol is described in detail. The ultrapurification techniques, essential for static surfaces, are also detailed. A capillary electrometer and associated measuring equipments, suitable for thermodynamic study of the same system is also described. The results are reported for the following systems. The numerical integration of differential capacity curves in order to obtain both qM and on a <b>printing</b> <b>calculator</b> (Friden 1217) is explained. Graphical differentiation of curves is also described. In the discussion part, the importance of the reference electrode in the same medium and reversible to a common ion is emphasized with illustrative examples from the literature. The experimental capacity data obtained in this work is compared with the data published by other workers in respect of accuracy and reproducibility. The main features of the differential capacity curves on mercury are discussed with reference to potential span, capacity range, concentration effects and ionic character. The diffuse layer parameters for the methanol systems have been tabulated as functions of charge and potential. Concept of solvent capacity is discussed for methanolic solutions and an absolute calculation of its magnitude attempted. The result is found to be 10...|$|E
