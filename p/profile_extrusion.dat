5000|$|Unlike in blown film, pipe, and sheet extrusion, {{the dies}} used in <b>profile</b> <b>extrusion</b> are rarely round or {{completely}} flat. Whereas a round (or flat) profile has uniform flow rates along all edges, {{this is not}} the case for more complex shapes. Take, for instance, the example of a simple, solid, square profile. The velocity of the melt is highest at the center of the die, and slowest at the edges and corners due to friction between the melt and die walls. When moving from the center of the die to the midpoint of one of the edges, the velocity gradient is high, especially near the outer die wall. However, when moving from the center to one of the corners, the velocity gradient is more gradual. As a result, the extruded square profile will experience more die swell at the edges than the corners, causing the once square profile to become more circular. This can be compensated for by bowing in the sides of the die so it approximates the shape of a four-pointed star; the sides of the polymer melt will now swell to the intended dimensions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The most {{important}} {{way to improve}} the quality of aluminum extrudates is to assure the material flow through die exit with the same velocity. Usually, aluminum <b>profile</b> <b>extrusion</b> is a very complex process of metal flow, which is mainly dependent on the level of the die design. Yet current design of extrusion die is primarily based on the trial-and-error method, which is to a large extent is determined by the experience of the die designers. In this research, a numerical model was developed to simulate the extrusion process for a complex section thin-walled aluminum profile with HyperXtrude. According to the non-uniformity of metal flow with the original die, several modifications, such as drainage channels, baffle plates and local bearing length, were performed to optimize the die structure. Finally, an optimal die design with more uniform flow velocity was achieved. The research results showed that the numerical model developed in this paper was effective for aluminum <b>profile</b> <b>extrusion</b> die optimization. ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: In this study, it {{is aimed}} to {{investigate}} the structure of seam weld and transverse weld sections comparatively. To achieve this, it is studied on an <b>extrusion</b> <b>profile</b> type which has seam weld and transverse weld regions. Design/methodology/approach: Producing <b>extrusion</b> <b>profile</b> has been performed by a press, which has a capacity of 1460 tones, in a real producing and carried out by changing the exit temperature and ram speed, which are the important parameters. Exit temperature TE, is chosen as 440, 475, 500, 520 and 560 °C. Extrusion speed is also taken {{in the base of}} ram speed VR, and production is carried out at the speeds of 2, 4, 6, 10 and 15 mm/s. Therefore the effects of extrusion parameters on macrostructure properties have been investigated. Findings: It is seen clearly that some differences are occurred from the viewpoint of structural features between the regions, when the experimental results are observed without regarding the extrusion parameters. In addition, it was observed commonly the structure of the material had a change through re-crystallization with increasing temperatures. This situation decreases the significance of seam weld regions. But insignificancy of seam weld region is designed as possible as can be from the viewpoint of decorative. However, when the macro structural figures have been investigated as the ram speed increases more significance on seam welds occurs. Research limitations/implications: Also some macrostructural differences in extrusion welds may occur for between having the other important extrusion parameters such as pressure and extrusion ratio. Therefore, effect of the other parameters can be investigated in future. Practical implications: In application, extrusion welds occur on both solid and hollow <b>profiles.</b> Moreover, <b>extrusion</b> temperature and speed often changes. This study shows that these parameters effect to macrostructure of extrusion welds.
