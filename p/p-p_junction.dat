40|$|We perform {{electrical}} transport measurements in graphene {{with several}} sample geometries. In particular, we design ``invasive'' probes crossing the whole graphene sheet {{as well as}} ``external'' probes connected through graphene side arms. The four-probe conductance measured between external probes varies linearly with charge density and is symmetric between electron and hole types of carriers. In contrast measurements with invasive probes give a strong electron-hole asymmetry and a sub-linear conductance {{as a function of}} density. By comparing various geometries and types of contact metal, we show that these two observations are due to transport properties of the metal/graphene interface. The asymmetry originates from the pinning of the charge density below the metal, which thereby forms a p-n or <b>p-p</b> <b>junction</b> depending on the polarity of the carriers in the bulk graphene sheet. Our results also explain part of the sub-linearity observed in conductance as a function of density in a large number of experiments on graphene, which has generally been attributed to short-range scattering only.

40|$|We have {{fabricated}} Si nanowires (NWs) {{by breaking}} Si-Si tip-sample junctions and studied their conductance for both p-n and p-p-type junctions at room temperature. Upon breaking the junction by retracting the Si tip from the Si clean surface, the conductance decreases by {{orders of magnitude}} from ~ 1 G 0 to ~ 10 − 6 G 0, where G 0 is the quantum unit of conductance. The conductance histogram plotted against log(G/G 0) reveals peaklike structures for G> 10 − 3 G 0, but becomes featureless for 10 − 6 G 0 <G< 10 − 3 G 0. In this low-conductance region, the histogram shows strong dependence on bias polarity and doping; the p-type-tip-n-type-sample junctions under positive sample biases yield large intensity in the histogram, while the same junctions under the opposite bias polarity and the <b>p-p</b> <b>junctions</b> under both bias polarities show small intensity below 10 − 4 G 0. This observation suggests that longer and thinner Si NWs can be preferably formed in the reversely biased p-n Si junctions. We also investigated how the conductance of Si NWs varies with the tip displacement DeltaL and found a quadratic dependence of log(G/G 0) on DeltaL, suggesting the localization of carriers in disordered Si NWs...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a strategy for}} creating an air-bridge-structured nanowire junction array platform that capable of reliably discriminating between three gases (hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide) in air. Alternatively driven dual nanowire species of ZnO and CuO with the average diameter of ∼ 30 nm on a single substrate are used and decorated with metallic nanoparticles to form two-dimensional microarray, which {{do not need to}} consider the post fabrications. Each individual nanowires in the array form n-n, <b>p-p,</b> and p-n <b>junctions</b> at the micro/nanoscale on single substrate and the junctions act as electrical conducting path for carriers. The adsorption of gas molecules to the surface changes the potential barrier height formed at the junctions and the carrier transport inside the straight semiconductors, which provide the ability of a given sensor array to differentiate among the junctions. The sensors were tested for their ability to distinguish three gases (H 2, CO, and NO 2), which they were able to do unequivocally when the data was classified using linear discriminant analysis. close 4...|$|R
40|$|Materials Science EngineeringIn this article, we {{introduce}} a facile synthesis and characterization of alternatively driven dual nanowire arrays with single crystalline nanostructures of ZnO and CuO that capable of reliably discriminating between three gases such as hydrogen (H 2), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitric dioxide (NO 2) in air. In the Part 1, {{we describe the}} fabrication process for multiple nanowires species (ZnO and CuO) growth via chemical vapor deposition at 773 - 873 K, without the incorporation of foreign atoms. This process can be simply achieved by a direct and simultaneous heating of metallic film with Zn and Cu followed by a conventional lithography. It was clearly observed {{that there is no}} chemical cross-contamination between them, separated by 5 µm, during the growth. Additionally, the sensing properties for the single crystalline nanowires of ZnO and CuO are then tested and compared for their ability to distinguish three gases (H 2, CO and NO 2) in air, which they were able to do unequivocally. In the Part 2, we also {{introduce a}} strategy for creating an air-bridge-structured nanowire junction array platform for their ability to distinguish three gases (H 2, CO and NO 2) in air. Alternatively driven dual nanowire species of ZnO and CuO on single substrate are used and decorated with metallic nanoparticles to form two dimensional microarray, which do not need to consider the post fabrications.
