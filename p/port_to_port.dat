5|$|By {{the time}} the Germans invaded Belgium in May 1940, there were still 40 tonnes of gold left in Belgium, held at the bank's offices in the port of Ostend. The only ship {{available}} in the area was A4, commanded by Lieutenant Van Vaerenbergh. On 19 May 1940, the vessel was loaded with the gold and, avoiding Dunkirk which was being bombed by the Luftwaffe, headed for the British coast, accompanied by the ship P16 which was carrying refugees. After being transferred from <b>port</b> <b>to</b> <b>port</b> because of concerns {{for the safety of}} the cargo during unloading, the gold was landed at Plymouth on 26 May, two days before the Belgian surrender. The gold was finally deposited at the Bank of England. A4 also carried Hubert Ansiaux, the civil servant charged with overseeing the evacuation of the gold to England and the future Governor of the National Bank.|$|E

25|$|Cutty Sark {{was ordered}} by {{shipping}} magnate John Willis, who operated a shipping company founded by his father. The company had {{a fleet of}} clippers and regularly {{took part in the}} tea trade from China to Britain. Speed was a clear advantage to a merchant ship, but it also created prestige for the owners: the 'tea race' was widely reported in contemporary newspapers and had become something of a national sporting event, with money being gambled against a winning ship. In earlier years, Willis had commanded his father's ships at a time when American designed ships were the fastest in the tea trade, and then had owned British designed ships, which were amongst the best available in the world but had never won the tea race. In 1868 the brand new Aberdeen built clipper Thermopylae set a record time of 61 days <b>port</b> <b>to</b> <b>port</b> on her maiden voyage from London to Melbourne and it was this design that Willis set out to better.|$|E

500|$|Molotov was {{commissioned}} {{just before the}} German invasion {{and spent most of}} 1941 moving from <b>port</b> <b>to</b> <b>port</b> to take advantage of her air warning radar, the first fitted in the Soviet Navy. She bombarded Axis positions near Feodosiya in early November and was sent to reinforce Sevastopol with elements of the 386th Rifle Division from Poti. Damaged by a number of shell hits while off-loading troops on 29 December, she was still able to take 600 wounded when she departed. She reprised her role as a transport {{during the first week of}} January. Her bow was damaged during a heavy storm in Tuapse when it was thrown against the jetty on 2122 January 1942. She spent most of the next month under repair, although her bow could not be straightened which reduced her speed by several knots. After making a number of bombardment sorties in support of Soviet troops on the Kerch Peninsula, she returned to Poti for more permanent repairs on 20 March. In June she made a number of transport runs in support of the garrison of Sevastopol. On 2 August her stern was blown off by torpedo bombers acting in concert with Italian MAS torpedo boats. The damage reduced her speed to [...] and she had to be steered by her engines. She was under repair at Poti until 31 July 1943, using the stern of the incomplete [...] Frunze, the rudder of the incomplete cruiser Zheleznyakov, the steering gear from Kaganovich and the steering sensor from the submarine L-25.
