25|$|A {{few months}} later, a panel led by Pavel Syerov {{questions}} Kira. They are evaluating the ideological suitability {{of students at}} the college where Kira studies engineering. Kira admits her bourgeois heritage and refuses to become an informant about Leo's political views. Andrei Taganov, a GPU officer, tells her that she is expelled. After the meeting, Andrei tells Kira that he admires the bravery she showed in defying the panel. He hopes that in a future world everyone can express themselves openly, but until then <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>her</b> must suffer. Since she will lose her ration card due to being expelled, he offers to get her {{a job in a}} railroad office.|$|E
500|$|Loretta {{has stated}} {{on-screen}} {{that she does}} not want to conform with the stereotype of a blond pole dancer, and makes it clear that she is a keen bird watcher and enjoys documentaries. Speaking of the character Walton stated, [...] "I love that Loretta's not a stereotypical stripper sort of girl—there’s a lot more depth to her. She’s actually quite shy and reserved. She’s got lots of interesting little hobbies, like bird-watching and Roman history! Then at night she skips off and turns into a stripper. It’s like two different lives, and I think many real-life pole-dancers are like that. They’re really nice, normal girls by day, and by night they turn into these temptresses." [...] Walton also praised the soap's realistic portrayal of the occupation, saying that many pole dancers attend university or have good professions but rely on stripping for extra money, and that she has met <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>her</b> character in the strip club where Hollyoaks films scenes.|$|E
500|$|Potter was at Hill Top in July 1906 {{during the}} {{development}} of Miss Moppet, and the kitten she borrowed as a model from a mason from Windermere was a difficult subject. [...] "n exasperating model," [...] Potter wrote, [...] "I have borrowed a Kitten and I am rather glad of the opportunity of working at the drawings. It is very young and pretty and a most fearful pickle." [...] Biographer Linda Lear explains that [...] "pickle" [...] was a word Potter used to describe [...] "free-thinking exuberant <b>people,</b> <b>like</b> <b>her</b> cousin Caroline, or mischievous kittens and small children." [...] Potter used the same drawings of the kitten {{as a model for}} her next book, The Tale of Tom Kitten, which she dedicated in 1907 [...] "to all Pickles—especially those that get upon my garden wall". Miss Moppet is one of Tom Kitten's sisters, and appears as a character in both books featuring him: The Tale of Tom Kitten and The Tale of Samuel Whiskers or The Roly-Poly Pudding (1908).|$|E

60|$|Become an {{authentic}} {{part of the}} town? She began to think with unpleasant lucidity. She reflected {{that she did not}} know whether the <b>people</b> <b>liked</b> <b>her.</b> She had gone to the women at afternoon-coffees, to the merchants in their stores, with so many outpouring comments and whimsies that she hadn't given them a chance to betray their opinions of her. The men smiled--but did they <b>like</b> <b>her?</b> She was lively among the women--but was she one of them? She could not recall many times when she had been admitted to the whispering of scandal which is the secret chamber of Gopher Prairie conversation.|$|R
50|$|Through the {{initiating}} {{years of}} her career, Ishimine established her popularity for the public as an Okinawan singer, especially due to the hit of her third single Hana. Nevertheless, {{she did not want}} to be regarded as such a matured vocalist with modest and magnificent songs as <b>people</b> <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> to perform those days. After five years since the debut, she started writing lyrics as she strongly desired to express herself with her own words. Around 2000, she began to play acoustic guitars to build her own style of an independent musical performer within herself.|$|R
500|$|Visiting Andy in the hospital, Ann {{suddenly}} kisses him, but immediately {{stops and}} guiltily walks out. Later, April, also {{relieved to see}} Andy is fine, finally agrees {{to go out with}} him. After they kiss, Andy decides to be honest and tells her about the earlier kiss with Ann. April angrily storms out, taking back her decision to go out with him. That night, Leslie sits on a bench in the empty Lot 48 and Mark joins her, with both appearing happy {{to be able to talk}} to each other. Mark tells her that if more <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>her</b> worked in local government, he wouldn't be leaving, and gives her plans he drew up for a park at Lot 48 before giving her a goodbye kiss on the cheek and walking way forever. The next day, Ron withdraws from the budget task force and appoints Leslie in his place. As Tom (Aziz Ansari) and his new girlfriend Lucy (Natalie Morales) are clearing out his office, he notices Ron is wearing a red shirt and black pants, the [...] "Tiger Woods" [...] outfit he always wears the day after having sex. Tom's ex-wife Wendy (Jama Williamson) then appears and kisses Ron and the two leave together, shocking Tom.|$|E
500|$|In late 2011, Yusef {{manages to}} win his former wife back. They later make plans to get married. Nina Wadia {{explains}} why Zainab is willing to forgive Yusef. Wadia said to Inside Soap: [...] "He tells Zainab that {{he was forced to}} start the fire by his family. Yusef goes on to explain that he knew it was wrong the minute he lit the match, and that he ran into the house to save her. And {{by the end of this}} conversation, she finds herself saying to him, 'Let's get married' - regardless! Obviously, it was something I struggled to get my head around. But being burnt in that fire is what they both have in common - and that experience connects them so deeply. She recognises that he made a mistake but also decides that the whole thing was probably her fault, because she walked out on their marriage." [...] Wadia continued: [...] "It doesn't look like Zainab's going to listen. But as Denise leaves, it's clear she's torn about what to do." [...] A short time before their wedding day arrives, Yusef starts to abuse Zainab both physically and mentally. He forbids Zainab to leave the house and later starts using her son, Kamil, to control her. Wadia explains that she wants the storyline to have a positive impact against real-life violence. She told BBC News :"I think the idea behind showing a strong woman like Zainab changing like this is to show that it can happen to even the strongest of women. They can change and they can be manipulated - especially if they're isolated from their friends and family. The manipulator can take advantage, so it's to prove that it can even happen to <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>her.</b> To be honest, if even one woman rings that Action Line at the end of the show and there's some difference made to her life, I'll feel like we've done our job," [...] she continued. [...] "It is a serious issue and I'm glad it's being highlighted. I hope that it wakes anyone up - not just women, I know that there are abused men out there as well. So if it gives anyone the strength to leave a relationship like that, we'll have done our job." [...] The scenes where Yusef refused to let Zainab see Kamil pulled in 8.69m viewers at 7.30pm. BBC Three's repeat of the episode later secured 994k viewers at 10pm.|$|E

Little snow <b>people,</b> <b>like</b> <b>her,</b> eat nothing but icicles. No, no, Peony; we must not give her anything warm to drink!" ...|$|E
60|$|Harriet blushed and smiled, {{and said}} {{something}} about wondering that <b>people</b> should <b>like</b> <b>her</b> so much. The idea of Mr. Elton was certainly cheering; but still, after a time, she was tender-hearted again towards the rejected Mr. Martin.|$|R

60|$|The parents' mouths were closed. Blanche and Angélique {{saved her}} all {{remaining}} trouble by chanting loud duets in their physician's praise; the other pupils echoed them, unanimously declaring {{that when they}} were ill they would have Dr. John and nobody else; and Madame laughed, and the parents laughed too. The Labassecouriens must have a large organ of philoprogenitiveness: at least the indulgence of offspring is carried by them to excessive lengths; the law of most households being the children's will. Madame now got credit for having acted on this occasion {{in a spirit of}} motherly partiality: she came off with flying colours; <b>people</b> <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> as a directress better than ever.|$|R

6000|$|Her {{confused}} reading {{during the}} last few years and her own observation and such leakages of fact into her life as the talk of Susan Burnet, had all contributed to her realization that the world was full of needless discomfort and hardships and failure, due to great imperfectly apprehended injustices and maladjustments in the social system, and recently it had been borne in upon her, upon the barbed point of the London Lion and the quick tongue of Susan, that if any particular class of people was more answerable than any other for these evils, it was the people of leisure and freedom like herself, who had time to think, and the directing organizing <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>her</b> husband, who had power to change. She was called upon to do something, at times the call became urgent, and she could not feel any assurance which it was of the many vague and conflicting suggestions that came drifting to her that she had to do. Her idea of Hostels for the International waitresses had been wrung out of her prematurely during her earlier discussions with her husband. She did not feel that it was anything more than a partial remedy for a special evil. She wanted something more general than that, something comprehensive enough to answer completely so wide a question as [...] "What ought I to be doing with all my life?" [...] In the honest simplicity of her nature she wanted to find an answer to that. Out of the confusion of voices about us she hoped to be able to disentangle directions for her life. Already she had been reading voraciously: while she was still at Marienbad she had written to Mr. Brumley and he had sent her books and papers, advanced and radical in many cases, that she might know, [...] "What are people thinking?" ...|$|E
60|$|Poor little Edie! What {{made her}} heart jump {{so at the}} mere mention of Lady Hilda? and what made the last few strokes {{at the top of the}} broken yew-tree look so very weak and shaky? How absurd of herself, she thought, to feel so much moved at hearing that there was another girl in the world whom Ernest might {{possibly}} fall in love with! And yet she had never even seen Ernest only ten days ago! Lady Hilda! What a grand name, to be sure, and what a grand person she must be. And then Ernest himself belonged by birth to the same class! For in poor little Edie's mind, innocent as she was of the nice distinctions of the peerage, Lady So-and-So was Lady So-and-So still, whoever she might be, from the wife of a premier marquis to the wife of the latest created knight bachelor. To her, Lady Hilda Tregellis and Lady Le Breton were both 'ladies of title'; and the difference between their positions, which seemed so immense to Ernest, seemed nothing at all to the merry little country girl who sat sketching beside him. After all, how could she ever have even vaguely fancied that such a young man as Ernest, in spite of all his socialistic whims, would ever dream of caring for a girl of the <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>her?</b> No doubt he would go to the Exmoors', fall naturally in love with Lady Hilda, and marry decorously in what Edie considered his own proper sphere of life! She went on with the finishing touches of her little picture in silence, and folded it up into the tiny portfolio at last with a half-uttered sigh. So her poor wee castle in the air was knocked down before she had begun to build it up in any real seriousness, and she turned to join Harry in the boat almost without speaking.|$|E
6000|$|... “No one knows,” Beatrix went on, without noticing this {{interruption}} {{except by}} a look, “what my mother’s life is. She hath been at early prayer this morning: she passes hours in her closet; {{if you were}} to follow her thither, you would find her at prayers now. She tends the poor of the place—the horrid dirty poor! She sits through the curate’s sermons—oh, those dreary sermons! And you see, on a beau dire; but good as they are, <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>her</b> are not fit to commune with us of the world. There is always, as it were, a third person present, even when I and my mother are alone. She can’t be frank with me quite; who is always thinking of the next world, and of her guardian angel, perhaps that’s in company. Oh, Harry, I’m jealous of that guardian angel!” here broke out Mistress Beatrix. “It’s horrid, I know; but my mother’s life is all for Heaven, and mine—all for earth. We can never be friends quite; and then, she cares more for Frank’s little finger than she does for me—I know she does: and she loves you, sir, a great deal too much; and I hate you for it. I would have had her all to myself; but she wouldn’t. In my childhood, it was my father she loved—(Oh, how could she? I remember him kind and handsome, but so stupid, {{and not being able to}} speak after drinking wine). And then, it was Frank; and now, it is Heaven and the clergyman. How I would have loved her! From a child I used to be in a rage that she loved anybody but me; but she loved you all better—all, I know she did. And now, she talks of the blessed consolation of religion. Dear soul! she thinks she is happier for believing, as she must, that we are all of us wicked and miserable sinners; and this world is only a pied à terre for the good, where they stay for a night, as we do, coming from Walcote, at that great, dreary, uncomfortable Hounslow inn, in those horrid beds. Oh, do you remember those horrid beds?—and the chariot comes and fetches them to Heaven the next morning.” ...|$|E

50|$|Pierce and Sonia {{get into}} an {{argument}} because Pierce thinks that Sonia had {{nothing to worry about}} all her life because she attended charm school. Sonia retaliates saying that she had to worry about things such as grades and if <b>people</b> <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> and her. Sonia also says that charm school taught young girls how to be ladies. They walk into the living room, where Wendell was telling his secretary of the wedding count. Upon hearing that, Pierce's mother then turns and asks Pierce when he's going to have a secretary. She says that she put them in church so that when they settled down she would have done her job. Intending that Pierce has not yet accomplished anything, Pierce tells his mother that it is not his fault. This upsets his mother as she tells him that it is his fault because of all the sacrifices that she and their father have given up for them.|$|R

The poem for which she became famous was originally composed on a brown paper shopping bag, and was reportedly inspired by {{the story of a young}} Jewish girl, Margaret Schwarzkopf, who had been staying with the Frye household and had been unable to visit her dying mother in Germany because of anti-Semitic unrest. [...] Because <b>people</b> <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> twelve-line, untitled verse, Frye made many copies and circulated them privately. She never published or copyrighted the poem.|$|R
