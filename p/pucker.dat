25|$|Kissing is {{a complex}} {{behavior}} that requires significant muscular coordination involving a total of 34facial muscles and 112postural muscles. The most important muscle involved is the orbicularis oris muscle, {{which is used to}} <b>pucker</b> the lips and informally known as the kissing muscle. In the case of the French kiss, the tongue is also an important component. Lips have many nerve endings which make them sensitive to touch and bite.|$|E
25|$|Inside {{the jacket}} of a suit, between the outer fabric {{and the inner}} lining, there is a layer of sturdy {{interfacing}} fabric to prevent the wool from stretching out of shape; this layer of cloth is called the canvas after the fabric from which it was traditionally made. Expensive jackets have a floating canvas, while cheaply manufactured models have a fused (glued) canvas. A fused canvas is less soft and, if poorly done, damages the suppleness and durability of the jacket, so many tailors are quick to deride fused canvas as being less durable, particularly since they may tend to permanently <b>pucker</b> along the jacket's edges after some use or a few dry cleanings. However, some selling this type of jacket claim that the difference in quality is very small. A few London tailors state that all bespoke suits should use a floating canvas.|$|E
25|$|Dholes produce {{whistles}} {{resembling the}} calls of red foxes, sometimes rendered as coo-coo. How this sound is produced is unknown, {{though it is}} thought to help in coordinating the pack when travelling through thick brush. When attacking prey, they emit screaming KaKaKaKAA sounds. Other sounds include whines (food soliciting), growls (warning), screams, chatterings (both of which are alarm calls) and yapping cries. In contrast to wolves, dholes do not howl or bark. Dholes have a complex body language. Friendly or submissive greetings are accompanied by horizontal lip retraction and the lowering of the tail, as well as licking. Playful dholes open their mouths with their lips retracted and their tails held in a vertical position whilst assuming a play bow. Aggressive or threatening dholes <b>pucker</b> their lips forward in a snarl and raise the hairs on their backs, as well as keep their tails horizontal or vertical. When afraid, they pull their lips back horizontally with their tails tucked and their ears flat against the skull.|$|E

500|$|Tanner {{joined the}} Ted Weems band {{as a singer}} in 1929 and became a {{prominent}} feature of the group. Tanner's whistling talent was unveiled by accident. In high spirits {{on their way to}} their next performance, the band members were singing, yelling and whistling on the bus. [...] When Tanner joined in, Weems was impressed enough to add a whistling segment to one of the band's sets. [...] Tanner whistled the Show Boat song, [...] "Make Believe"; the audience asked for an encore. Tanner's whistling became so popular that Perry Como, another featured performer in the band, said “The whistler was the whole band.” [...] On occasion, Tanner’s lips would <b>pucker</b> up, interfering with his whistling. [...] Although generally noted for his graciousness as a bandleader, Weems would have fun at Tanner’s expense, running him through the most difficult songs in his repertoire when he noticed Tanner was struggling.|$|E

40|$|The {{main focus}} of this thesis is to {{investigate}} the relative conformational flexibilities of α-, β- and γ-cyclodextrins in water by analysing their macrocyclic ring <b>puckering</b> motion from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. In particular, the <b>puckering</b> of the CDs is investigated through a coarse grained analysis of full atomistic simulations, where the CD conformational motions are studied on the macrocyclic scale rather than the atomistic scale. The flexibilities of the cyclodextrins (CDs) are then compared to their experimentally-observed aqueous solubility trend {{in order to try}} explain the anomalously flow solubility of β-cyclodextrin. β-CD has important applications in industry, such as the pharmaceutical industry, thus exploring the conformational reasons for its low solubility can help to design more effective cyclodextrin-based products in future. The ring <b>puckering</b> of the CDs is measured quantitatively using a reduced system of <b>puckering</b> coordinates based on the method of triangular tessellation. The triangular tessellation definition for monocylic 6 -membered rings is first extended to 7 - and 8 -membered rings, and the corresponding <b>puckering</b> coordinates are derived mathematically. The macrocyclic CD rings are then simplified to monocyclic representations through an appropriate coarse graining of the molecules (specifically, α-, β- and γ-cyclodextrins are simplified to 6 -, 7 - and 8 -sided rings, respectively), and the corresponding triangular tessellation definition is then used to measure their macrocyclic <b>puckering.</b> The rates of decay of the <b>puckering</b> motion are then calculated using time correlation functions, from which the relative flexibilities of the CDs is determined. Probability distributions are also used to investigate the ranges of the CD <b>puckering.</b> In addition, the horizontal contraction and expansion of the macrocyclic rings (termed """"breathing"""" herein) is analysed to supplement the <b>puckering</b> analysis. <b>Puckering</b> coordinates based on the triangular tessellation of 6 -membered rings have been used previously to characterise all 38 canonical states of cyclohexane. In this thesis, a systematic procedure is developed to generate the triangular tessellation <b>puckering</b> coordinates of all the canonical states of 6 -, 7 - and 8 -membered rings, and the coordinates for all canonical states of cycloheptane and cyclooctane are subsequently generated. These <b>puckering</b> coordinates can be useful not only in the conformational analysis of cyclohexane, cycloheptane and cyclooctane, but also to quantitatively characterise the conformations of 6 -, 7 - and 8 -membered rings in general, both from experimental and computational studies...|$|R

2500|$|Parameters {{taken from}} the spectrum, mainly NOESY cross-peaks and {{coupling}} constants, {{can be used to}} determine local structural features such as glycosidic bond angles, dihedral angles (using the Karplus equation), and sugar <b>pucker</b> conformations. [...] For large-scale structure, these local parameters must be supplemented with other structural assumptions or models, because errors add up as the double helix is traversed, and unlike with proteins, the double helix does not have a compact interior and does not fold back upon itself. [...] NMR is also useful for investigating nonstandard geometries such as bent helices, non-Watson–Crick basepairing, and coaxial stacking. [...] It has been especially useful in probing the structure of natural RNA oligonucleotides, which tend to adopt complex conformations such as stem-loops and pseudoknots. [...] NMR is also useful for probing the binding of nucleic acid molecules to other molecules, such as proteins or drugs, by seeing which resonances are shifted upon binding of the other molecule.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{presents}} an automated method {{for the assessment}} and classification of <b>puckering</b> defects detected during the preproduction control stage of the sewing machine or product inspection. In this respect, we have presented the possible causes and remedies of the wrinkle nonconformities. Subjective factors related to the control environment and operators during the seams evaluation can be reduced using an automated system whose operation is based on image processing. Our implementation involves spectral image analysis using Fourier transform and an unsupervised neural network, the Kohonen Map, employed to classify material specimens, the input images, into five discrete degrees of quality, from grade 5 (best) to grade 1 (the worst). The <b>puckering</b> features presented in the learning and test images have been pre-classified using the seam <b>puckering</b> quality standard. The network training stage will consist in presenting five input vectors (derived from the down-sampled arrays), representing the <b>puckering</b> grades. The <b>puckering</b> classification consists in providing an input vector derived from the image supposed to be classified.

The results have been fitted to quartic-quadratic potential functions in the <b>puckering</b> coordinate, with a barrier to inversion of 503 cm- 1 (1 • 44 kcal mole- 1 = 6 • 02 kJ mole- 1) in the ground state and 491 cm- 1 in the excited state ν 14 = 1. For reasonable assumptions about the reduced mass, the equilibrium dihedral angle of the C 4 ring is determined to be about 35 °, in agreement with previous estimates. Ueda and Shimanouchi's observations on the 2878 cm- 1 C 4 H 8 band have been re-analysed, and <b>puckering</b> sidebands have also been observed and analysed for the 1083 cm- 1 v 14 infra-red fundamental of C 4 D 8.
