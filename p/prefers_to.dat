50|$|Assuming {{no option}} is <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> itself i.e. the {{relation}} is irreflexive, a preference relation with a loop is not transitive. For if it is, each {{option in the}} loop is <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> each option, including itself. This can be illustrated for this example of a loop among A, B, and C. Assume the relation is transitive. Then, since A is <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> B and B is <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> C, also A is <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> C.

5|$|The species Timema cristinae {{exhibits}} both striped and unstriped populations {{depending on}} the host plant, a form of polymorphism that clearly illustrates the camouflage function of the stripe. The earliest ancestors of this species were generalists that fed on plants belonging to both the genera Adenostoma and Ceanothus. They eventually diverged into two distinct ecotypes with a more specialist host plant preference. One ecotype <b>prefers</b> <b>to</b> feed on Adenostoma while the other ecotype <b>prefers</b> <b>to</b> feed on Ceanothus. The Adenostoma ecotype possesses a white dorsal stripe, an adaptation {{to blend in with}} the needle-like leaves of the plant, while the Ceanothus ecotype does not (Ceanothus spp. have broad leaves). The Adenostoma ecotype is also smaller, with a wider head, and shorter legs.|$|E

5|$|It differs in {{appearance}} from the similar {{lesser yellow-headed vulture}} in several ways. It {{is larger than the}} lesser yellow-headed vulture, with a longer, broader tail. The plumage is a dark, glossy black in contrast to the lesser yellow-headed vulture's browner plumage. Its legs are darker in color and its head is more yellow and less orange/pink than that of the lesser yellow-headed vulture. Its wings are broader and its flight is also steadier. Unlike {{the other members of the}} genus Cathartes, the greater yellow-headed vulture has relatively dark inner primaries, which contrast slightly with the paler secondaries and outer primaries. The greater yellow-headed vulture <b>prefers</b> <b>to</b> live in forests while the lesser yellow-headed vulture <b>prefers</b> <b>to</b> inhabit savannas, and it is more heavily built than the lesser yellow-headed vulture. The greater yellow-headed vulture is also somewhat larger than the turkey vulture. It can be distinguished from that species only at relatively close range by the differing head coloration. The underwing coloration is similar to the turkey vulture but the greater yellow-headed usually has a faint but broad and dark band vertically down the middle of the wings.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses have {{a closed}} circulatory system, where the blood remains inside blood vessels. Octopuses have three hearts; a {{systemic}} heart that circulates blood round {{the body and}} two branchial hearts that pump it through {{each of the two}} gills. The systemic heart is inactive when the animal is swimming and thus it tires quickly and <b>prefers</b> <b>to</b> crawl.|$|E
5|$|Other {{members of}} the genus Pholiota may be mistaken for Pholiota flammans, {{especially}} Pholiota squarrosa which commonly forms large tufts {{at the base of}} deciduous as well as coniferous trees. P.squarrosa tends to be a less intense yellow color than P.flammans. P.adiposa is also similar, but <b>prefers</b> <b>to</b> grow on dead hardwoods; unlike P.flammans, it has gelatinous scales on the stem as well as the cap.|$|E

5|$|The co-main event {{featured}} a bout between two top contenders and undefeated light heavyweights, Lyoto Machida and Thiago Silva. The two were originally {{scheduled to meet}} at UFC 89, but a back injury forced Silva {{to withdraw from the}} contest. UFC President Dana White indicated in the pre-fight press conference that Machida would receive a title shot with a victory, while Silva would need to defeat Machida and win one more contest before earning the same opportunity. Machida is a fighter who <b>prefers</b> <b>to</b> counter-strike, and combines Shotokan Karate, sumo wrestling and Brazilian jiu-jitsu to form his own style. Silva is a Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt, but <b>prefers</b> <b>to</b> fight standing. Machida entered the UFC 94 fight following a unanimous decision victory over former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Tito Ortiz at UFC 84, where he won every round on the judge's scorecards.
