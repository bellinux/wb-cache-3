5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{development}} {{of nuclear power}} in the United States slowed to a halt, as new plants were cancelled or put on hold. The 1983 financial collapse of the Washington Public <b>Power</b> <b>Supply</b> <b>System,</b> a government agency planning to build five large nuclear power plants throughout the state, and the Three Mile Island accident of 1979 both contributed {{to a decline in}} interest in the university's nuclear program. Student use of the reactor was replaced by commercial use to produce nuclear isotopes for medical use. By 1988, the enrollment in UW's nuclear engineering program shrunk to 23 students, and it was cancelled entirely in 1992.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{reactors}} {{were shut down}} between 1964 and 1971, with an average individual life span of 22 years. The last reactor, N Reactor, continued to operate as a dual-purpose reactor, being both a power reactor used to feed the civilian electrical grid via the Washington Public <b>Power</b> <b>Supply</b> <b>System</b> (WPPSS) and a plutonium production reactor for nuclear weapons. N Reactor operated until 1987. Since then, most of the Hanford reactors have been entombed ("cocooned") to allow the radioactive materials to decay, and the surrounding structures have been removed and buried. The B-Reactor has not been cocooned and is accessible to the public on occasional guided tours. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992, and some historians advocate converting it into a museum. B reactor was designated a National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service on August 19, 2008.|$|E

The DC systems in the USSR had a nominal voltage of 3 kilovolts.

2500|$|GEN-III OMNI-V - VII devices can {{differ from}} {{standard}} Generation 3 {{in one or}} both of two important ways. First, an automatic gated <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>system</b> regulates the photocathode voltage, allowing the NVD to instantaneously adapt to changing light conditions. The second is a removed or greatly thinned ion barrier, which decreases the number of electrons that are usually rejected by the Standard GEN III MCP, hence resulting in less image noise and the ability to operate with a luminous sensitivity at 2,850K of only 700, compared to operating with a luminous sensitivity of at least 1,800 for GEN III image intensifiers. [...] The disadvantage to a thin or removed ion barrier is the overall decrease in tube life from a theoretical 20,000 hrs mean time to failure (MTTF) for Gen III type, to 15,000 hrs MTTF for GEN IV type. However, this is largely negated by the low number of image intensifier tubes that reach 15,000 hrs of operation before replacement.|$|E

Development of {{indicators}} of the structural and parametrical organization of effective active and adaptive system of service of <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>systems</b> in the conditions of ideology of Smart Grid.

In the conditions of application of ideology of Smart Grid for increase of intellectualization of electrical power system {{there is a need}} of introduction of the principle of a network centrism in the structural and parametrical organization of elements of <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>systems</b> that involves performance of conditions on implementation of provisions of the principle of Situational Awareness. The essence of this principle consists in that, information on a condition of system has to be presented in the form convenient for the analysis, recognition, transfer, distribution and storage, to be coordinated for flexible and optimum development at the subsystem and object-by-object levels.
