Values of shear moduli, G = G' + jG'', were determined {{under conditions of}} potentiodynamic and <b>potentiostatic</b> <b>electrochemical</b> <b>control,</b> as functions of potential (0. 0 < E/V < 0. 8), temperature (5 < T/ degrees C < 70), and angular frequency (omega = 2 pi f; 10 < f/MHz < 110). The effect of potential was small, of temperature was significant, and of frequency was dominant. The principle of time-temperature equivalence was used to construct master relaxation curves. Application of activation, Williams-Landel-Ferry, and Rouse-Zimm models shows the material to be quite different from other thiophene-based conducting polymers, namely, poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) and regioregular poly(3 -hexylthiophene).

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy revealed the presence of zinc oxide on the PPy/GO/ZnO nanocomposite. A supercapacitor was fabricated by sandwiching a ﬁlter paper immersed in a sodium sulfate solution between two nickel foam electrodes coated with the PPy/GO/ZnO nanocomposite.

40|$|The {{electrochemical}} behaviour of pure aluminium in an EDTA-containing chloride {{solution was}} investigated using potentiodynamic and <b>potentiostatic</b> <b>electrochemical</b> techniques and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. A pronounced EDTA-induced anodic dissolution {{was observed in}} alkaline solutions, but the presence of EDTA in solution had little activating effect on the passivation properties at pH values close to 4. 0. This was attributed to the relative stability of the Al(EDTA) − complex formed at the different pH values. This EDTA-induced activation had no deleterious effect on pitting attack, in fact, higher breakdown potentials were observed {{in the presence of}} EDTA. This was attributed to the buffering action of EDTA, which inhibited the attainment of a critical pit solution composition. But, in the presence of molybdate, EDTA had no observable effect on pitting attack.

The following is {{an assessment of the}} corrosion resistance of Titanium powder coatings. <b>Potentiostatic</b> <b>electrochemical</b> experiments were carried out on three substrates (stainless steel, mild steel and Aluminium) coated using two spray methods (plasma and HVOF). A discussion of the results was given with reference to the polarisation curves that were created, SEM images, XRD results, estimates of porosity, and Pourbaix diagrams.

Also, the corrosion mechanism for the coatings is pitting of the substrates at the end of pores. The extent of this is far greater for the HVOF than the plasma coating. It was found that features found in the polarisation curves for the substrates are present in the curves for coatings. This is more evident in the HVOF polarisation curves.
