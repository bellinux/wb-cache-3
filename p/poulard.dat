50|$|The {{traditional}} aim {{of plant}} breeding {{is to improve}} the agronomic or nutritional qualities of a crop. Typical goals are improved yield, reduced susceptibility to diseases and pests, homogeneous maturation (to optimize harvest) and increased tolerance to environmental stresses—i.e., drought, acid soil, high or cold temperature, etc. Most of the known wheat species today are polyploid.Whereas common bread wheat is hexaploid, Khorasan wheat is tetraploid. To do further breeding with this tetraploid Khorasan wheat, the genetic pool to use is a little bit limited to the tetraploid subspecies of triticum turgidum such as Durum (subsp. durum), Polish (subsp. polonicum), Persian (subsp. carthlicum), Emmer (subsp. dicoccum) and <b>Poulard</b> (subsp. turgidum) wheat. Especially to develop resistances against common fungi (e.g. Fusarium Head Blight), this genomic pool is interesting. Problematic in this case, is the economic unimportance of most of the tetraploid subspecies of wheat (except Durum), which limits the investment to do intensive breeding, especially compared to the highly important common bread wheat.|$|E

40|$|A {{project of}} a Germplasm Bank {{has been carried}} out at the Interdepartmental Research Centre for Agri- Food Biological Resources Improvement and Valorization (Biogest-Siteia, UNIMORE), aimed to wheat longterm conservation, {{valorization}} and exploitation. Nowadays, the Germplasm Bank keeps more than 150 accessions, including ten ancient cultivars, which have been all morphologically characterized, according to “Descriptor List for Wheat” (1). Identification of the secondary metabolites responsible for end-use quality of wheat may be considered a key-factor for all stake-holders, i. e. breeders, producers, grain handlers, millers, bakers and final consumers (2, 3, 4). Recent studies have focused on phenolic content of whole wheat, due to their antioxidant, antiinflammatory, anti-carcinogenic properties (3, 5, 6), highlighting furthermore that important differences in metabolic profile occur among cultivated varieties. The intense breeding programs developed since the 50 s years of the last century, resulted in the selection of new wheat cultivars with high yield, less subjected to crop lodging and able to provide high strength flour, with a high aptitude to withstand mechanical processing. This resulted, in turn, in the replacement of local varieties and mostly in the decrease of the genetic variability. Notwithstanding, there has been recently a renewal of interest in the so-called “ancient grains”, cultivars with a distinct regional connotation, used in the last century or even earlier. In the present study, nine ancient varieties of wheat: Autonomia, Gentil rosso, Grano del miracolo, Inallettabile, Leone aristato, Mentana, <b>Poulard</b> di Ciano, Risciola, and Terminillo were compared with some modern cultivars. Extracts of whole meal flour were subjected to separation by LC-ESI-MS-TQ and phenolic compounds, i. e. hydroxycinnamic acids, hydroxybenzoic acids, flavones, and vanillin, were determined. Total phenolic content, expressed as gallic acid equivalents, of each sample was determined using the Folin–Ciocâlteu procedure. The ancient cultivars of wheat showed a phenolic content significantly higher in comparison with the modern cultivars. The ancient variety <b>Poulard</b> di Ciano (also known as Turgido Reggiano) was widely cultivated in the northern Italy and in Emilia Romagna region {{in the first years of}} XX century and can be considered the real autochthonous wheat of Reggio Emilia province. It showed the highest total phenolic content, followed by Risciola, Grano del Miracolo, Terminillo, and Leone Aristato (ranging between 0. 95 and 0. 70 mg/g, expressed as gallic acid equivalents). The lowest value was recorded for the modern cultivar Zanzibar (0. 33 mg/g, as gallic acid equivalents). Many differences among cultivars emerged when quali-quantitative analysis were carried out. Terminillo showed statistically highest concentration of ferulic acid, followed by Risciola, Grano del Miracolo, Gentil Rosso, <b>Poulard</b> di Ciano, and Leone Aristato, while Blasco (taken as reference for modern cultivars) had the lowest concentration. Syringic acid presented the highest value for Risciola, Leone Aristato, and Mentana. <b>Poulard</b> di Ciano showed very high concentrations of sinapinic acid, while Blasco had the lowest content. Vanillin and vanillic acid, two biochemically correlated 4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxyphenyl- derivates, are very liked flavoring agents. They were found in Grano del Miracolo at the highest concentrations. Risciola, as well, showed high content of vanillin, followed by Inallettabile, while vanillic acid was present in high concentration in Gentil rosso, Terminillo, and Leone aristato. Blasco, also in this case, did not show high concentration of these metabolites. A complete comparison with all the cultivars stored in the Germplasm Bank is currently in progress. In the light of these first results the nutritional characteristics of the caryopsis, rich in micronutrients and compounds with nutraceutical activity, and the opportunity of increasing a more sustainable model of agriculture, make the ancient varieties of wheat an invaluable heritage to safeguard...|$|E
40|$|On December 4, 1867, {{the ninth}} {{day of the}} {{convention}} to write a new post-Civil War constitution {{for the state of}} Louisiana, delegate Edouard Tinchant rose to propose that the convention should provide “for the legal protection in this State of all women” in their civil rights, “without distinction of race or color, or without reference to their previous condition. ” Tinchant’s proposal plunged the convention into additional debates ranging from voting rights and equal protection to recognition of conjugal relationships not formalized by marriage. This article explores the genesis of Tinchant’s conceptions of citizenship and women’s rights through three generations of his ancestors starting with a woman called Rosalie of the <b>Poulard</b> Nation. This family’s story is a part of a history of vernacular concepts of rights and dignity in the Atlantic world, concepts rooted in the awareness of individual and family vulnerability. The family’s multiple encounters with administrative and legal writings—including manumission papers, baptismal records, wills, and marriage contracts—suggest some of the dynamics of engagement with law they sought to assert and document freedom and to secure its full benefits. Their story also suggests the importance of citizenship to those who had known statelessness in its starkest form, that of enslavement and deportation...|$|E
40|$|The {{stability}} of an evaporating thin liquid film on a solid substrate is investigated within lubrication theory. The heat flux due to evaporation induces thermal gradients; the generated Marangoni stresses are accounted for. Assuming the gas phase at rest, {{the dynamics of}} the vapour reduces to diffusion. The boundary condition at the interface couples transfer from the liquid to its vapour and diffusion flux. A non-local lubrication equation is obtained; this non-local nature comes from the Laplace equation associated with quasi-static diffusion. The linear {{stability of}} a flat film is studied in this general framework. The subsequent analysis is restricted to moderately thick films for which it is shown that evaporation is diffusion limited and that the gas phase is saturated in vapour {{in the vicinity of the}} interface. The stability depends only on two control parameters, the capillary and Marangoni numbers. The Marangoni effect is destabilising whereas capillarity and evaporation are stabilising processes. The results of the linear stability analysis are compared with the experiments of <b>Poulard</b> et al (2003) performed in a different geometry. In order to study the resulting patterns, the amplitude equation is obtained through a systematic multiple-scale expansion. The evaporation rate is needed and is computed perturbatively by solving the Laplace problem for the diffusion of vapour. The bifurcation from the flat state is found to be a supercritical transition. Moreover, it appears that the non-local nature of the diffusion problem unusually affects the amplitude equation...|$|E
40|$|From French and Creole to Spanish, {{the domain}} of the Napoleonic Empire to the king of Spain, {{crossing}} the strait separating the French colony of Saint-Domingue and the Spanish colony of Cuba entailed a change of language and government. Some 18, 000 people made that transition between {{the spring and summer of}} 1803 during the Revolutionary War in Saint-Dominque. Six years later, many crossed the Gulf of Mexico from Cuba to New Orleans and the recently acquired Louisiana Territory under the authority of a territorial governor and the United States Congress. What would these crossings lead to for those who had been slaves in Saint-Domingue and to those who would claim them as property? This article explores these issues in two overlapping dimensions: first, through the land and other official classifying documents; second, through the families and life experiences of these immigrants.

40|$|The {{concept of}} decentralised flood {{protection}} (or water retention) {{is based on}} localising and using the natural capability of a catchment to retard run off as early as possible, and at several places at the same time, {{by means of a}} combination of different small-scale technical and non-technical measures (Assmann, 1999; DWA, 2006; DWA, 2013 a; Schulte et al., 2007). Intense rainfall and heavy floods in August 2002, which caused extraordinarily high levels of inundation and damage, affected the Ore Mountains, a low range mountain region in eastern Germany. Against this background, the objective of this investigation has been developed to analyse the capability of headwater areas to mitigate floods for downstream locations at different spatial scales. Based on this idea, the hydrological effect of selected small, well-placed retention facilities was analysed for the Natzschung catchment. The above-mentioned concept is well established in German literature and recent studies have been reviewed, but it is also well known in the international context (Liaw et al., 2006; Mendel & Liebscher, 2010; <b>Poulard</b> et al., 2010; Scholz & Yang, 2010). Over recent years, several approaches and investigations have analysed the performance of these measures in terms of retention or detention ponds and other techniques (Reinhardt et al., 2011; Rieger, 2012). The discussion of pros and cons is still in progress, but the lack of data clearly remains an issue, especially concerning the capability and the effect of retention facilities at different spatial scales and for varying flood return periods (McMinn et al., 2010; Mendel & Liebscher, 2010). The analysis of the Natzschung catchment offered the potential for uncontrolled retention facilities at 19 locations, in the upper and middle basin. They include already existing small retention and detention ponds, and areas with valley-crossing street embankments with an ambiguous purpose. These facilities were implemented in a distributed hydrological model (NASIM) to simulate local and regional flood retarding effects with regard to a 100 -year flood recurrence interval. The total storage capacity is over 500. 000 m³ at a mean storage level of 3. 6 m, and encompasses an area of more than 50 km². At all retention facilities, the discharge at the outlets is curbed and reduced by between 6 % and 75 %, with a mean of 40 %. More than 390. 000 m³ of the retention capacity is used (72 %). This scenario induced a decrease in peak discharge from a level of 63. 4 m³/s to a value of 45. 2 m³/s (- 28. 7 %) at the gauging station Rothenthal (total area of 75 km²). At the catchment outlet 5 km downstream, the peak discharge remains lowered, at a level of 53. 7 m³/s (- 25. 4 %). At both locations, the peak arrived forty-five minutes later. For all analysed locations in the catchment, a distinct effect concerning the peak reduction and the temporal shift of the peak could be observed. At the gauging station the HQ 100 could be attenuated to a discharge comparable to a return period under a 50 year flood event (<HQ 50). This is not only important for the main objective of flood protection, as a reduction in discharge also means a decrease in stream power, erosion and the sediment transport capacity of fluvial systems (Borga et al., 2011). After the August flood in 2002, several streams along the Ore Mountains were affected by sediment deposition dominated by boulders and cobbles. The sediments reduced the hydraulic cross section of the rivers and caused severe damage along the banks (IKSE, 2004; LFULG, 2009; LTV, 2004; RMD, 2005). The results have also shown that the total storage capacity is sufficient, but a redesign or a flexible control system of the outlets and the storage level of the basins could lower the costs and also improve the performance for larger flood events. However, the detection, survey and implementation of these kinds of retention facilities are labour and cost-intensive and need to be improved. This flood retention concept considers regional and local flood protection targets and the specific hydrological conditions and capabilities of a catchment. The implementation of these kind of measures in stream headwaters could be a feasible way to establish an effective and additional flood protection for the local and downstream settlements of the Ore Mountains, and for other low range mountain systems...|$|E
