2500|$|The <b>Payloader,</b> a {{stripped}} down version optimised for aerial crane work, {{was the third}} civil model of the S-61. The <b>Payloader</b> features the fixed undercarriage of the S-61L, but with an empty weight almost [...] less than the standard S-61N.|$|E
5000|$|The {{last show}} at Sunnyside {{took place on}} June 24, 1977 and the {{building}} was demolished in December of the same year. [...] The Daily News reported on December 6th, that the <b>payloader</b> at the demolition site, having fallen partly into the basement after collapsing a basement was vandalized, as was a second <b>payloader</b> sent to rescue the first. [...] At least it didn’t go without a fight.|$|E
50|$|The {{second was}} with the International Harvester, for the {{production}} of the front loader IH <b>Payloader</b> H60B, which extended {{until the end of the}} 1970s.|$|E
25|$|By midnight Friday, an {{estimated}} 2,000 cars were stranded on Main Street and about 8,000 on other {{streets in the}} City of Buffalo. By Saturday morning, visibility improved and the City sent their plows back out. The many abandoned cars made their job more difficult. By 6:00 am, Buffalo's Commissioner of Street Sanitation had 30 private tow trucks removing vehicles; later in the day, the number would rise to 50. Saturday afternoon, dump trucks and <b>payloaders</b> dumped snow into the Niagara River.|$|R
40|$|Because the {{acoustic}} environments of construction sites include multiple noise sources from various construction machines, {{it is necessary}} to consider the influence of combined noise on annoyance. The aim {{of this study is to}} examine the effects of {{the acoustic}} characteristics of combined construction noise on annoyance. Six construction machines, including machines for foundation work (pile drivers, earth augers, and <b>payloaders)</b> and demolition work (breakers, bulldozers, and excavators) were selected as noise sources in construction sites, and auditory experiments were designed to quantify the annoyance caused by the machines individual and combined noise. The results show that both individual and combined noise correlate well with the equivalent sound level (L-Aeq), but that the annoyance caused by combined noise is significantly higher than the annoyance caused by individual noise when L-Aeq increases over 65 dBA. Among the psychoacoustic measures, loudness is the most important in determining the annoyance caused by individual noise, whereas both loudness and roughness significantly impact the annoyance caused by combined construction noise. Ranges of an optimum stationary-to-mobile machine noise ratio between two construction machine noises are suggested to minimize the annoyance caused by combined noise. Optimum stationary-to-mobile machine noise ratio ranges usually include 0 dBA when reference construction noise levels (e. g., pile driver or breaker) are lower than 60 dBA, whereas the stationary-to-mobile machine noise ratio should be greater than 5 dBA as construction noise levels exceed 65 dBA. These findings provide useful information to establish effective noise management plans for combined noise sources in construction sites. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
50|$|On 16 November 1990, the {{locomotive}} was moved, first pushed by a <b>payloader</b> along tracks from Summerside to New Annan, then along portable tracks over an intersection, until it reached a cheering crowd at Kensington Railway Station at about 16:00. Twenty years later, Confederation Trails and the P.E.I. Museum and Heritage Foundation {{agreed to a}} joint project to refurbish {{the locomotive}}. The project will also install fencing, signage, and interpretive panels, and landscape the surrounding area.|$|E
50|$|A loader {{is a heavy}} {{equipment}} machine used in construction to move aside or load materials such as asphalt, demolition debris, dirt, snow, feed, gravel, logs, raw minerals, recycled material, rock, sand, woodchips, etc. into or onto another type of machinery (such as a dump truck, conveyor belt, feed-hopper, or railroad car). There are many types of loader, which, depending on design and application, are called by various names, including bucket loader, front loader, front-end loader, <b>payloader,</b> scoop, shovel, skip loader, wheel loader, or skid-steer.|$|E
50|$|He {{is former}} PBL chairman, {{and has been}} {{financing}} the stints of the Philippine women’s basketball team in several international tournaments and {{has been known to}} support charitable causes. He donated a P1.8 Million <b>payloader</b> to the Tacloban city government {{in the wake of the}} Yolanda tragedy. He gave Asi Taulava his first break in Philippine basketball by signing him to play for Blu Detergent in the PBL in 1997 and was once close to managing Manny Pacquiao before he became a world champion. He is chairman of the Philippine Secondary School Basketball Championship (PSSBC).|$|E
5000|$|The {{administration}} of Mayor Ted Peter P. Plagata lasted until June 30, 2007. Among his many accomplishments were : concreting of Poblacion to Alabidhan National Road, concreting of Castillanes Street, Cataluña Street, Plaga Street, Derecho Street, Lampino Street, Pagara Street, and Castroverde Street. He also {{made possible the}} installation of Municipal streetlights, construction of BNHS Covered Gym, Solar Dyers in Barangays, construction of grand stand and oval of Bingawan Elementary School, acquisition of <b>Payloader,</b> Grader, Ambulance and Nissan Terrano Patrol Car, and the purchase of Lot for the Municipal Dump Site. The remarkable legislation of the Sangguniang Bayan was the Palamangkutanon Sang Banwa ( [...] Citizen’s Query) Ordinance.|$|E
40|$|On June 12 th, 2003, a 41 -year-old {{truck driver}} was {{delivering}} cardboard sludge to a recycling plant that manufactures bedding for dairy cows {{when he was}} fatally crushed between the tailgate of his truck and the rear of a <b>payloader.</b> He had completed dumping the cardboard waste product onto an outdoor unloading pad, and pulled {{a short distance away}} to secure the tailgate of his truck. As he was securing the tailgate, a <b>payloader</b> backed out of the adjacent storage building, making a 90 degree turn in order to move the waste material from the unloading pad into the building. The operator of the <b>payloader</b> was unaware of the dump truck and backed into the truck, crushing the truck driver between the two vehicles. The operator of the <b>payloader</b> immediately went for help, notifying a co-worker who called 911 and notified the owner of the plant of the incident. An emergency squad responded within minutes. The truck driver was pronounced dead upon arrival at the hospital. New York State Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation (NY FACE) investigators concluded that to help prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future: Facilities should be properly designed and unloading procedures modified to promote safety; <b>Payloader</b> operators should survey the surrounding area prior to backing; Safety devices should be checked at each shift change to ensure proper operation. Additional safety devices should be installed in areas of high traffic; Truck drivers should pull dump trucks a safe distance away from the unloading area prior to securing the tailgate. Companies should consider instituting policies that specify this distance...|$|E
