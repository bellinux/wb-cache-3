Late in October 1956, Israel, Britain, and France retaliated against Egypt after the latter country had seized the Suez Canal. In response to the crisis, Alameda County moved to Suda Bay, Crete, and had an emergency air base in operation by 22 November. From then until 4 December, she staged United Nations forces into the troubled area while evacuating Americans and other foreign nationals. Soon thereafter, she resumed normal operations out of Naples.|$|E

Although the band has changed, we’ve lost Layne, we’ve added Will, {{and there was no}} master plan. Playing again in 2005 felt right, so we did the next thing and toured. We did it step by step. It’s more than just making music, and it always has been. We’ve been friends a long time. We’ve been more of a family than most, and it had to be okay from here", Cantrell said pointing to his heart.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with London's Evening Standard in January 2013, Anthony Hopkins (who played the eponymous role in the 2012 Alfred Hitchcock biopic Hitchcock) questioned The Girls portrayal of the director {{and the need for}} a film about that period of Hitchcock's career: [...] "I talked to Tippi Hedren one day...and she never mentioned that...Whatever his obsession was, she didn't want to dwell on it...I don't think it's necessary to <b>put</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> into a movie." [...] Speaking to The Independent later that month, Hitchcock director Sacha Gervasi said, [...] " [...] seems a rare one-note portrayal {{of a man who was}} a little more complex than that. A lot of people, who were there, do not recognise this portrayal of him as this monster". Danny Huston, who played screenwriter Whitfield Cook in Hitchcock, told WENN.com that he believed Hitchcock would not have contested Hedren's account of him: [...] "Hitchcock was such a deliciously dark character that I don't think he would dismiss what Tippi was saying as not true." ...|$|E

But, <b>putting</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> aside for the present, {{do you think that}} a man's political opinions should be held in regard to his own individual interests, or to the much wider interests of others, whom we call the public?" ...|$|R

2500|$|The Pesikta Rabbati {{taught that}} Joseph guarded himself against lechery and murder. That he guarded himself against lechery is {{demonstrated}} by the report of him in [...] “But he refused, and said to his master's wife: 'Behold, my master, having me, knows not {{what is in the}} house, and he has <b>put</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> he has into my hand; he is not greater in this house than I; neither has he kept back any thing from me but you, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?” That he guarded himself against murder {{is demonstrated by}} his words in [...] “As for you, you meant evil against me; but God meant it for good.” ...|$|E

The part that {{was hard for me}} was {{actually}} doing the mask,where they <b>put</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> plaster on your face and you have to lie there still for a long time. Fortunately, I was an acrobat growing up, and a very very good one — I won a lot of contests — so I knew how to control my body and be 'quiet.' You had to do that, you had to be very still and lay there and be a 'good patient.' A young actor will do anything to get their mug on the screen! I remember that the makeup process took about three hours. I had to lay back and be perfectly still as they put this plaster mold on my face. After seeing the test, everyone was very enthusiastic about going ahead with making Planet of the Apes. But they felt the makeup needed a little more work and perfecting before it would look good on screen." ...|$|E

And some of these issues are of such scale that you got to have the governments doing things like making carbon expensive. Or making coal expensive to burn and <b>putting</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> carbon into the atmosphere. And individuals can't do that, individual communities can't do that. It takes national governments." ...|$|R

It has to be.

But <b>putting</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> aside, I should like to bet that the germ, the vital spark of the opera, felt itself life, felt itself flame, first of <b>all</b> in <b>that</b> exquisite moment of release which Nemorino's caper conveys.

500|$|Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Johnson {{was raised}} as the {{youngest}} of three siblings. Johnson began fighting {{at the age of}} 10, after his father's fatal heart attack. The incident made Johnson want to exert his anger physically. Johnson later said, [...] "I lost something, a huge part of me....Fighting was my way of not dealing with my dad's passing.
