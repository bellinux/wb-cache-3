40|$|Promotion is an {{essential}} element in the marketing mix. It is used by businesses to inform, influence and persuade customers to adopt the products and services they offer. Without promotion, business would be stagnant and lack substantial growth because the brands would have low visibility in the market. Moreover, today’s vast and assorted markets comprise of customers with different needs and varied behavior. So it is rarely possible for companies to satisfy all customers by treating them alike. Thus there arises a need to divide the market into segments having customers with similar traits/characteristics. After identifying appropriate market segments, firms can design differentiated promotional campaigns for each segment. At {{the same time there}} can be a mass market promotional campaign that reaches different segments with a fixed spectrum. Also since promotional effort resources are limited, one must use them judiciously. In this paper, we formulate mathematical programming problem under repeat purchase scenario, which optimally allocates mass promotional effort resources and differentiated promotional effort resources across the segments dynamically in order to maximize the overall sales obtained from multiple products of a product line under budgetary and minimum sales aspiration level constraint on each <b>product</b> <b>under</b> <b>consideration</b> in each segment. The planning horizon is divided into multi periods, the adoption pattern of each product in each segment is observed in every subinterval and accordingly promotional effort allocations are determined for the next period till we reach the end of planning period. The optimization model has been further extended to incorporate minimum aspiration level constraints on total sales for each <b>product</b> <b>under</b> <b>consideration</b> from all the segments taken together. The non linear programming problem so formulated is solved using differential evolution approach. A numerical example has been discussed to illustrate applicability of the model. </p...|$|E

40|$|Consumer {{choice is}} often a {{function}} of the shared (alignable) and unique (nonalignable) attributes of the <b>products</b> <b>under</b> <b>consideration.</b> Most empirical work till date has found that the alignable differences have a significantly greater influence on consumer choice than the non-alignable differences. This is marked by a well-documented tendency for consumers to choose options that are superior on the alignable attributes over options that are superior on the nonalignable attributes. Nonetheless, in this paper we show that there are several contextual (attribute variance, attribute tradeoffs), situational (anticipated satisfaction, promotion focus), and individual-level (exploratory tendency) factors that may influence decision makers {{to pay more attention to}} nonalignable differences than to alignable differences. Taken together, these studies provide converging evidence that the degree of noncomparison-based processing is a critical factor in determining the relative influence of alignable and nonalignable attributes in choice tasks. Alignable attributes dominate in decisions that involve extensive comparisons among alternatives. However, nonalignables loom large when decision makers are encouraged to engage in non-comparison based processing. ...|$|R

Agricultural materials have heterogeneous inner structures and irregular shapes cultured by nature.

40|$|Purpose – The {{present study}} using the Consumer Ethnocentric Tendencies Scale (CET-SCALE) aims to {{evaluate}} the level of consumer ethnocentrism (CE) and its implications on their evaluation of food products. Furthermore, it seeks to examine {{the level at which}} country of origin (COO) effect is activated (country, product or attribute) per consumer cluster of different level of CE in a food evaluation context. Design/methodology/approach – For attaining the above aims, a questionnaire was developed and completed by 274 respondents. The set of countries of origin and <b>products</b> <b>under</b> <b>consideration</b> encompasses Greece, Italy and Holland and yellow cheese, ham and beer. Findings – The use of the CET-SCALE pinpointed that the sample can be characterised as marginally ethnocentric. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses justified the uni-dimensionality of CE. Cluster analysis allocated the sample into two clusters, the ethnocentric and the non-ethnocentric. The results showed that ethnocentrism affects not only consumer beliefs, but also the way perceived quality of domestic and foreign products are evaluated, culminating in the appearance of COO-effect. In ethnocentric consumers, the COO effect is activated at the initiatory level of the country a food product originates in (country-specific), except when the foreign country of origin is given, where the COO effect is activated {{at the level of the}} product type (product-specific). In the non-ethnocentric cluster, COO does not lead to an overall acceptance or rejection, but instead it affects the evaluation of specific product attributes (attribute-specific). Research limitations/implications – The survey suffers the limitation of focusing on the influence of ethnocentric beliefs in food products evaluation and not on their real impact on final purchasing behaviour. Consumer ethnocentrism and COO effect are linked together, but the stimulus that activates their link differs according to the strength of ethnocentric beliefs held by consumers; that given, different marketing strategies should be applied depending on the level of CE of the target-group selected. Originality/value – Internationally, the issue of COO-effect is comprehensively examined, yet the literature has focused almost explicitly on hi-tech or fashion products and services. This fact attaches particular importance to the present study, which is concerned exclusively with food products...|$|R
