5|$|Several unique {{chemicals}} {{are produced by}} Mycena haematopus. The primary pigment is haematopodinB, which is so chemically sensitive (breaking down upon exposure to air and light) that its more stable breakdown product, haematopodin, was known before its eventual discovery and characterization in 2008. A chemical synthesis for haematopodin was reported in 1996. Haematopodins are the first pyrroloquinoline alkaloids discovered in fungi; pyrroloquinolines combine the structures of <b>pyrrole</b> and quinoline, both heterocyclic aromatic organic compounds. Compounds of this type also occur in marine sponges and are attracting research interest due to various biological properties, such as cytotoxicity against tumor cell lines, and both antifungal and antimicrobial activities. Additional alkaloid compounds in M.haematopus include the red pigments mycenarubins D, E and F. Prior {{to the discovery of}} these compounds, pyrroloquinoline alkaloids were considered to be rare in terrestrial sources.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} elements in organic chemistry. Many organic functional groups involve a carbon–nitrogen bond, such as amides (RCONR2), amines (R3N), imines (RC(=NR)R), imides (RCO)2NR, azides (RN3), azo compounds (RN2R), cyanates and isocyanates (ROCN or RCNO), nitrates (RONO2), nitriles and isonitriles (RCN or RNC), nitrites (RONO), nitro compounds (RNO2), nitroso compounds (RNO), oximes (RCR=NOH), and pyridine derivatives. C–N bonds are strongly polarised towards nitrogen. In these compounds, nitrogen is usually trivalent (though it can be tetravalent in quaternary ammonium salts, R4N+), with a lone pair that can confer basicity on the compound by being coordinated to a proton. This may be offset by other factors: for example, amides are not basic because the lone pair is delocalised into a double bond (though they may act as acids at very low pH, being protonated at the oxygen), and <b>pyrrole</b> is not acidic because the lone pair is delocalised as part of an aromatic ring. The amount of nitrogen in a chemical substance can be determined by the Kjeldahl method. In particular, nitrogen is an essential component of nucleic acids, amino acids and thus proteins, and the energy-carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate and is thus vital to all life on Earth.|$|E

25|$|<b>Pyrrole</b> is a colorless {{volatile}} liquid that darkens readily upon {{exposure to}} air, {{and is usually}} purified by distillation immediately before use. <b>Pyrrole</b> has a nutty odor. <b>Pyrrole</b> is a 5-membered aromatic heterocycle, like furan and thiophene.

In CDCl3, it has chemical shifts at 6.68 (H2, H5) and 6.22 (H3, H4). <b>Pyrrole</b> is weakly basic, with a conjugate acid pKa of −3.8. The most thermodynamically stable pyrrolium cation (C4H6N+) is formed by protonation at the 2 position. Substitution of <b>pyrrole</b> with alkyl substituents provides a more basic molecule—for example, tetramethylpyrrole has a conjugate acid pKa of +3.7. <b>Pyrrole</b> is also weakly acidic at the N–H position, with a pKa of 17.5.|$|E
