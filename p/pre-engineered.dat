25|$|An {{ironworker}} is the US {{term for}} a tradesman (man or woman) {{who works in the}} ironworking industry. A structural/ ornamental Ironworker, erects (or even dismantles) the structural steel framework of <b>pre-engineered</b> metal buildings, single and multi-story buildings, stadiums, arenas, hospitals, towers, wind turbines, and bridges. Ironworkers assemble the structural framework in accordance with engineered drawings. Ironworkers also unload, place and tie reinforcing steel bars (rebar) as well as install post-tensioning systems, both of which give strength to the concrete used in piers, footings, slabs, buildings and bridges. Ironworkers load, unload, place and set machinery and equipment and operate power hoists, forklifts, and aerial lifts. They unload, place and fasten metal decking, safety netting and edge rails to facilitate safe working practices. Ironworkers finish buildings by erecting curtain wall and window wall systems, pre-cast concrete and stone, stairs and handrails, metal doors, sheeting and elevator fronts. Ironworkers perform all types of industrial maintenance as well.|$|E

50|$|The Dumas Seed Company {{warehouse}} is a Butler Building, {{constructed on}} a concrete foundation and floor with rigid-frame steel walls and roof. The Butler Manufacturing Company began building structures for the agricultural industry in 1907 when it introduced the galvanized steel grain bin, opening its Galesburg, Illinois facility in 1939 to meet government {{demand for the}} storage bins during the New Deal. After considerable success with grain bin production, the company branched out into <b>pre-engineered</b> buildings in 1939. Although not a new concept, engineers had previously considered {{the application of a}} <b>pre-engineered</b> rigid frame to prefabricated buildings as not feasible due to the complicated stress calculations required. Two engineers working for the Butler Company found a way to make it work and consequently contributed by producing a pre-fabricated, <b>pre-engineered</b> building that assembled easily, requiring less steel and labor than previous <b>pre-engineered</b> buildings. Steelworkers in Butler's Galesburg facility began manufacturing steel buildings after WWII. The company manufactured the components at the factory, and then shipped them via railroad to building sites where a concrete slab served as a foundation for the on-site assemblage of the building. The Butler Manufacturing Company continues to manufacture steel <b>pre-engineered</b> buildings today, including other factories and <b>pre-engineered</b> football practice facilities, warehouses, churches, offices, and airplane hangars.|$|E

50|$|During the 1960s, {{standardized}} engineering {{designs for}} buildings were first marketed as PEBs. Historically, the primary framing {{structure of a}} <b>pre-engineered</b> building is an assembly of -shaped members, often referred as I-beams. In <b>pre-engineered</b> buildings, the I beams used are usually formed by welding together steel plates to form the I section. The I beams are then field-assembled (e.g. bolted connections) to form the entire frame of the <b>pre-engineered</b> building. Some manufacturers taper the framing members (varying in web depth) according to the local loading effects. Larger plate dimensions are used in areas of higher load effects.|$|E

50|$|While <b>pre-engineered</b> {{buildings}} can {{be adapted}} to suit a wide variety of structural applications, the greatest economy will be realized when utilising standard details. An efficiently designed <b>pre-engineered</b> building can be lighter than the conventional steel buildings by up to 30%. Lighter weight equates to less steel and a potential price savings in structural framework.|$|E
50|$|As in {{the case}} of the simple cycle gas turbine <b>pre-engineered</b> and {{packaged}} plant, Westinghouse also pioneered with the idea of a <b>pre-engineered</b> combined cycle plant.

50|$|Self-framing metal {{buildings}} are {{a form of}} <b>pre-engineered</b> building which utilizes roll formed roof and wall panel diaphragms as significant parts of the structural supporting system.
