40|$|Heritability of {{mastitis}} (and {{diseases in}} general) {{tends to be}} low. One possible cause is that no clear distinction can be made between resistant and nonresistant animals, because healthy animals include animals {{that have not been}} exposed to pathogens and resistant animals. To account for this, we quantified the prevalence of clinical mastitis (CM) and subclinical mastitis (SCM) in 2, 069 Swedish Holstein herds as a measure of exposure. <b>Herd</b> <b>prevalence</b> averaged 26. 5 % for SCM and 6. 4 % for CM; 61 % of the first lactations of 177, 309 cows were classified as having at least one case of SCM and 10 % as having CM. In a reaction norm approach, heritability of (S) CM was quantified as a function of <b>herd</b> <b>prevalence</b> of (S) CM. The best-fitting model was a second-order polynomial of first-lactation cow SCM as a function of <b>herd</b> <b>prevalence</b> SCM, and a first-order (linear) polynomial of first-lactation cow CM as a function of CM <b>herd</b> <b>prevalence.</b> Heritability for SCM ranged from 0. 069 to 0. 105 and for CM from 0. 016 to 0. 032.

40|$|The {{burden of}} Salmonella {{entering}} pig slaughterhouses across the European Union (EU) {{is considered a}} primary food safety concern. In order to assist EU Member States {{with the development of}} National Control Plans, we have developed a farm transmission model applicable to all Member States. It is an individual-based stochastic Susceptible-Infected model, that takes into account four different sources of infection of pigs (sows, feed, external contaminants such as rodents and new stock) and various management practices linked to Salmonella transmission/protection (housing, flooring, feed, All-In-All-Out production). A novel development within the model is the assessment of dynamic shedding rates. The results of the model, parameterized for two case study Member States (one high and one low prevalence) suggest that breeding <b>herd</b> <b>prevalence</b> is a strong indicator of slaughter pig prevalence. Until a Member States’ breeding <b>herd</b> <b>prevalence</b> is brought below 10 % then the sow will be the dominant source of infection to pigs raised for meat production; below this level of breeding <b>herd</b> <b>prevalence,</b> feed becomes the dominant force of infection...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to estimate calf and <b>herd</b> <b>prevalence</b> of Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp., the <b>herd</b> <b>prevalence</b> clustering, spatial distribution according to soil type and shedding patterns in dairy calves from Cordoba, Argentina. Six hundred twenty calves younger than 7 weeks of age from 43 dairy herds were sampled. Samples were processed with the formol-ether and modified Ziehl-Neelsen techniques. Univariate analysis and Kruskall-Wallis tests were used. Factors associated were subjected to multivariate analysis with calf shedding intensity as the response variable. Clustering of <b>herd</b> <b>prevalence</b> was assessed by a scan method, and spatial analysis was applied to explore the overlapping of high <b>prevalence</b> <b>herds</b> and soil type. Overall calf prevalence for Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts and Giardia spp. cysts were 19. 35 % (95 % CI: 16. 14; 22. 54) and 34. 50 % (95 % CI: 30. 69; 38. 34), respectively.

40|$|The {{national}} bovine paratuberculosis (PTB) seroprevalence (apparent prevalence) in the Belgian {{cattle population}} {{was determined by}} a serological survey that was conducted from December 1997 to March 1998. In {{a random sample of}} herds (N= 556, 9. 5 %), all adult cattle of 24 months of age or older (N= 13, 317, 0. 4 %) were tested for the presence of antibodies using a commercially available absorbed ELISA test kit. The PTB median within-herd seroprevalence (proportion of detected animals within the seropositive herds) and the PTB individual-animal seroprevalence (proportion of detected animals) were, respectively, 2. 9 % (quartiles= 1. 6 - 5. 6) and 0. 87 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0. 71 - 1. 03). The PTB herd seroprevalence (proportion of detected herds) was 18 % (95 % CI= 14 - 21). Assuming a test sensitivity and specificity of 45 and 99 % [Sweeney et al., 1995. J. Vet. Diagn. Invest. 7 (4), 488; Sockett et al., 1992. J. Clin. Microbiol. 30 (5), 1134], respectively, the median true within-herd prevalence and the true individual-animal were estimated to be 7 and 2 %, respectively. The true <b>herd</b> <b>prevalence</b> of Mycobacterium paratuberculosis infection was first estimated according to currently accepted methodology. This calculation revealed that the specificity of the used test has a dramatic effect on the estimation; assuming a test sensitivity of 45 % and a true within-herd prevalence of 7 %, the true <b>herd</b> <b>prevalence</b> estimation decreased from 36 to 0. 8 % if the test specificity decreased from 99. 9 to 99 %, respectively. This sensitivity analysis showed that the practical limits of the accuracy of the used screening test jeopardize the estimation of the true <b>herd</b> <b>prevalence</b> within reasonable confidence limits, because the within-herd PTB true prevalence was low. For this reason we augmented the herd specificity for herds with larger adult herd size (> 5). This was done by increasing the cut-off number of positive cattle required (>/= 2) to classify a herd truly positive and including herds with one positive test result if there was historical evidence of PTB (previous diagnosis and/or clinical signs). This approach resulted in an estimated true <b>herd</b> <b>prevalence</b> of M. paratuberculosis infection of 6 %.

With a sample size of 6000 herds at least 1 truly infected herd was detected in 99 % of the iterations. The low sensitivity of the ELISA test, the assumed low <b>herd</b> <b>prevalence,</b> the typical low within-herd prevalence of PTB and the small herd sizes in Norway all present problems in detection of the disease. The results showed that the ratio between false-positive herds and true positive herds detected had a median of 70 : 1. At the assumed <b>herd</b> <b>prevalence</b> of 0. 2 % and a cost/test of 70 NOK the median cost of detecting 1 infected herd was approximately 900, 000 NOK. If 2 positive reactors were needed to classify a herd "infected" the median cost of detecting 1 infected herd was 5, 055, 000 NOK. Our results suggest that a randomized national prevalence survey would not be feasible, due to the low probability of detecting infected herds and because of the high number of false-positive reactions that would be expected. </p...|$|R

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Diagnostic Medicine/PathobiologyRobert L. LarsonBradley J. WhiteBovine viral {{diarrhea}} virus (BVDV) is an endemic pathogen in the U. S. cow herd. The virus {{can cross}} the placental barrier and infect the unborn fetus. If infection occurs between 45 – 125 days of gestation, persistent infection (PI) in the unborn fetus is likely. Upon parturition, the PI calf {{is a lifelong}} shedder of BVDV significantly elevating the risk of viral exposure to non-PI cattle. Despite reports of significant production loss, many BVDV infections are subclinical {{and in some cases}} inconsequential. Our data has highlighted various factors potentially causing disparity in clinical outcomes following BVDV exposure including: variation of BVDV serum concentration among PI cattle which may influence the quantity of virus shed into the environment, preexisting BVDV immune (i. e. antibody) status among non-PI cattle, and the degree of stress experienced by non-PI cattle all may influence the susceptibility of disease. Additionally, cattle transiently infected (TI) with BVDV may temporarily shed BVDV thereby offering another source of exposure to non-PI cattle. Programs focusing on BVDV control and prevention consist of diagnostic tests to identify PI cattle, BVDV vaccines to reduce fetal infection and increase herd immunity, and biosecurity programs intended to prevent BVDV exposure to the resident herd. Survey work performed in Montana suggest that educating beef producers with regard to BVDV has significantly increased the implementation of these tools {{in order to reduce the}} risk of introducing BVDV to their resident herd. Despite the risk of production loss, the economic benefit of instituting whole-herd BVDV tests may vary due to <b>herd</b> <b>prevalence.</b> By utilizing Monte Carlo simulation, the current BVDV <b>herd</b> <b>prevalence</b> within the U. S. does not economically justify a nationwide BVDV eradication campaign. However, known BVDV positive herds and herds with an elevated likelihood (47 %) of being BVDV positive displayed a positive economic outcome when whole-herd BVDV testing strategies were implemented across herd sizes of 50, 100, and 500 cows.

The 'user-friendly' model interface allows the input of key assumptions and farm specific parameters enabling model simulations to be tailored to individual farm circumstances. The model simulates the effect of Johne's disease and various measures for its control in terms of <b>herd</b> <b>prevalence</b> and the shedding states of animals within the herd, the financial costs of the disease and of any control measures and the likely benefits of control of Johne's disease for the beef suckler herd over a 10 -year period. The model thus helps to make more transparent the 'hidden costs' of Johne's in a herd and the likely benefits to be gained from controlling the disease. The control strategies considered within the model are 'no control', 'testing and culling of diagnosed animals', 'improving management measures' or a dual strategy of 'testing and culling in association with improving management measures'. An example 'run' of the model shows that the strategy 'improving management measures', which reduces infection routes during the early stages, results in a marked fall in <b>herd</b> <b>prevalence</b> and total costs. Testing and culling does little to reduce prevalence and does not reduce total costs over the 10 -year period...|$|R
40|$|A {{protocol}} {{was developed and}} applied in a field survey to incorporate evaluation of herd welfare into the existing quality assurance program in Dutch dairy farming. Welfare {{was derived from the}} state of the biological needs of cows. Welfare targets and critical control points were selected according to HACCP principles, while restriction was to dairy herds with loose-cubicle housing (> 90 % of Dutch herds). The feasibility for measurement of the {{protocol was}} tested in a pilot study with 52 preselected, medium-sized herds for time needed for the observations (set at ~ 1 h to 2 h), robustness of parameters (threshold of 80 % true cases for repeated scores), and opinions from inspectors and farmers, which were variable but positive on average. The final protocol consisted of 16 animal-based and 14 environment-based parameters. From a random sample of 240 dairy herds (1 % of Dutch farms), 164 herds (12, 267 cows) with median herd size of 67 cows (SD= 38) participated in the field survey, on a voluntary basis. The time needed for scoring averaged 78 min (SD= 22) per herd. Animal-based parameters included leg disorders, normal and abnormal locomotion, external lesions, skin and teat problems, poor body condition, and fearfulness of the <b>herd.</b> <b>Herd</b> <b>prevalence</b> averaged highest for abnormal locomotion (43. 8 %), swollen hocks and knees (25. 2 %), dermatophytosis (24. 2 %), scabies (20. 1 %), and filthiness (17. 4 %). However, <b>herd</b> <b>prevalence</b> was lowest (96 % of herds). Overall, our results indicate various directions for welfare improvement in practice, both at the individual farm and sector level...|$|R
40|$|The {{problems}} addressed are: (1) {{comparison of}} prevalences of Salmonella spp. in different herd {{types in the}} Danish pig population after implementation of the Danish Salmonella Control Program (DSCP), and (2) to make {{a reference to a}} study from 1993 / 1994 (pre-implementation) with a discussion of possible biases when diagnostic methods differ slightly. The objectives were to present the prevalences of Salmonella spp., Salmonella Typhimurium, and multiresistant S. Typhimurium DT 104 in Danish pig herds in 1998. Further, to discuss how <b>herd</b> <b>prevalences</b> may be compared to a previous study. A bacteriological study in 1998 comprised: (a) a random sample of slaughter pig producing herds (N= 1962); (b) a random sample of farrow-to-grower (sow) herds (N= 305); and (c) all breeding and multiplying (genetic) herds (N= 366). A previous bacteriological study on Salmonella presence in 1993 / 1994 served {{as a model for the}} present study. The results of the study were that multiresistant S. Typhimurium DT 104 was detected in one herd producing slaughter pigs. The <b>herd</b> apparent <b>prevalences</b> (HAPs) of Salmonella spp. were 11. 7, 16. 7 and 11. 4 % in genetic, sow, and slaughter pig herds, respectively. The conclusion of the study was that prevalence of multiresistant S. Typhimurium DT 104 was low in the examined slaughter pig herds.

Fecal samples for forty-six herds with diarrhea or a history of diarrhea were randomly collected in Minas Gerais state, Brazil. The enteric pathogens were detected by culture (E. coli and Salmonella sp.), PCR (L. intracellularis and Brachyspira spp.) and eggs counts (T. suis). The overall <b>herd</b> <b>prevalence</b> of L. intracellularis, Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium and enterotoxigenic E. coli were 19. 56 %, 6. 52 %, 10. 86 % respectively.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the prevalence and pattern of bovine par atuberculosis occurrence in indigenous and exotic cattle breeds in Wakiso and Masaka districts, Uganda. A cross-sectional survey was carried in these districts with a well-established small-holder commercial dairy system supplying livestock products to major urban centers. Questionnaires were administered to farmers prior to blood sampling. Results revealed farmers operated open herds and were acquiring replacement stock from fellow farmers, cattle traders or donations. Most cattle in Wakiso were zero-grazed with a few grazed on pastures; communally, in paddocks or tethered. In contrast most cattle in Masaka were fed on pastures as opposed to zero grazing. Of 436 adult cattle sero-tested in Wakiso, par atuberculosis was highest in indigenous cattle (15 %), was 8. 3 % in cross-breeds and 5. 8 % in exotic breeds. Individual cow prevalence in Wakiso was 7. 8 % whilst <b>herd</b> <b>prevalence</b> was 36. 23 %. Screening of 384 adult cattle in Masaka revealed prevalence of par atuberculosis of 3. 26, 4. 48 and 4. 9 % in the indigenous breeds, exotic dairy and cross breeds, respectively, with individual cow prevalence of 3. 91 % and <b>herd</b> <b>prevalence</b> of 24. 44 %. The prevalence of par atuberculosis was significantly higher in Wakiso compared to Masaka (p< 0. 05, χ 2 = 5. 5043). The factors associated with increased risk of herd infection included; “where adult cattle were housed”, “adult cattle fed on pasture”, “calves allowed to suckle their mothers” and “calves not separated from their mothers”. This study confirms the presense of par atuberculosis in Ugandan cattle and shows that farmers are unaware of its occurrence or prevention...|$|R

40|$|Ethiopia has {{the largest}} cattle {{population}} in Africa. The {{vast majority of the}} national herd is of indigenous zebu cattle maintained in rural areas under extensive husbandry systems. However, in response to the increasing demand for milk products and the Ethiopian government's efforts to improve productivity in the livestock sector, recent years have seen increased intensive husbandry settings holding exotic and cross breeds. This drive for increased productivity is however threatened by animal diseases that thrive under intensive settings, such as bovine tuberculosis (BTB), a disease that is already endemic in Ethiopia. An extensive study was conducted to: estimate the prevalence of BTB in intensive dairy farms in central Ethiopia; identify associated risk factors; and characterize circulating strains of the causative agent, Mycobacterium bovis. The comparative intradermal tuberculin test (CIDT), questionnaire survey, post-mortem examination, bacteriology, and molecular typing were used to get {{a better understanding of the}} BTB prevalence among dairy farms in the study area. Based on the CIDT, our findings showed that around 30 % of 2956 tested dairy cattle from 88 herds were positive for BTB while the <b>herd</b> <b>prevalence</b> was over 50 %. Post-mortem examination revealed gross tuberculous lesions in 34 / 36 CIDT positive cattle and acid-fast bacilli were recovered from 31 animals. Molecular typing identified all isolates as M. bovis and further characterization by spoligotyping and MIRU-VNTR typing indicated low strain diversity within the study area. This study showed an overall BTB <b>herd</b> <b>prevalence</b> of 50 % in intensive dairy farms in Addis Ababa and surroundings, signalling an urgent need for intervention to control the disease and prevent zoonotic transmission of M. bovis to human populations consuming dairy products coming from these farms. It is suggested that government and policy makers should work together with stakeholders to design methods for the control of BTB in intensive farms in Ethiopia...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the <b>herd</b> <b>prevalence</b> of veal and dairy herds and to identify risk factors for VTEC O 157 positive veal herds. The study was based on monitoring data from November 1996 through July 2005 of 1051 dairy herds and 930 veal herds. The <b>herd</b> level <b>prevalence</b> (95 % CI) was 8. 0 % (6. 4 ¿ 9. 6) for dairy herds and 12. 6 % (10. 5 ¿ 14. 7) for veal herds.

The original publication is available at [URL] tuberculosis (bTB) is a chronic debilitating disease and is a cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} in livestock, wildlife and humans. This study estimated the prevalence and risk factors associated with bovine tuberculosis transmission in indigenous cattle at the human-animal interface in the Serengeti ecosystem of Tanzania. 	A total of 1, 103 indigenous cattle from 32 herds were investigated for the presence of bTB using the Single Intradermal Comparative Tuberculin Test. Epidemiological data on herd structure, management and grazing system were also collected. The apparent individual animal prevalence of tuberculin reactors was 2. 4 % (95 % confidence interval (CI), 1. 7 &# 8211; 3. 5 %), whereas the true prevalence was 0. 6 % CI, 0. 6 &# 8211; 0. 7 % as indicated by a reaction to avian tuberculin purified protein derivatives (PPD) which is more than 4 &# 160;mm greater than the reaction to avian tuberculin PPD. The results showed that 10. 6 % (117 / 1, 103) showed non-specific reactions (atypical mycobacterium). The <b>herd</b> <b>prevalence</b> of 50 % (16 / 32) was found. Tuberculin skin test results were found to be significantly associated with age, location, size of the household and animal tested. Of 108 respondents, 70 (64. 8 %) individuals had not heard about bovine tuberculosis at all. Thirty five percent (38 / 108) of respondents at least were aware of bTB. About 60 % (23 / 38) of respondents who were aware of bTB had some knowledge on how bTB is spread. Eighty one percent (87 / 108) of respondents were not aware of the presence of bTB in wildlife. There is regular contact between cattle and wild animals due to sharing of grazing land and water sources, with 99 % (107 / 108) of households grazing cattle in communal pastures. The study has demonstrated a high reported interaction of livestock with wildlife and poor knowledge of most cattle owners concerning bTB and its transmission pathways among people, livestock and wildlife. Although the overall proportion of animals with bTB is relatively low, <b>herd</b> <b>prevalence</b> is 50 % and <b>prevalence</b> within <b>herds</b> varied considerably.
