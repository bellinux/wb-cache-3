5|$|Mesa Verdeans {{typically}} harvested local small game, {{but sometimes}} organized hunting parties that traveled long distances. Their {{main sources of}} animal protein came from mule deer and rabbits, but they occasionally hunted Bighorn sheep, antelope, and elk. They began to domesticate turkeys starting around 1000, and by the 13th century consumption of the animal peaked, supplanting deer as the primary <b>protein</b> <b>source</b> at many sites. These domesticated turkeys consumed large amounts of corn, which further deepened reliance on the staple crop. Puebloans wove blankets from turkey feathers and rabbit fur, and made implements such as awls and needles from turkey and deer bones. Despite the availability of fish in the area's rivers and streams, archaeological evidence suggests that they were rarely eaten.|$|E

25|$|It is {{possible}} with protein combinations of two incomplete protein sources (e.g., rice and beans) {{to make a}} complete <b>protein</b> <b>source,</b> and characteristic combinations are the basis of distinct cultural cooking traditions. However, complementary sources of protein {{do not need to}} be eaten at the same meal to be used together by the body. Excess amino acids from protein can be converted into glucose and used for fuel through a process called gluconeogenesis.|$|E
25|$|Proteins are {{structural}} materials {{in much of}} the animal body (e.g. muscles, skin, and hair). They also form the enzymes that control chemical reactions throughout the body. Each protein molecule is composed of amino acids, which are characterized by inclusion of nitrogen and sometimes sulphur (these components are responsible for the distinctive smell of burning protein, such as the keratin in hair). The body requires amino acids to produce new proteins (protein retention) and to replace damaged proteins (maintenance). As there is no protein or amino acid storage provision, amino acids must be present in the diet. Excess amino acids are discarded, typically in the urine. For all animals, some amino acids are essential (an animal cannot produce them internally) and some are non-essential (the animal can produce them from other nitrogen-containing compounds). About twenty amino acids are found in the human body, and about ten of these are essential and, therefore, must be included in the diet. A diet that contains adequate amounts of amino acids (especially those that are essential) is particularly important in some situations: during early development and maturation, pregnancy, lactation, or injury (a burn, for instance). A complete <b>protein</b> <b>source</b> contains all the essential amino acids; an incomplete <b>protein</b> <b>source</b> lacks {{one or more of the}} essential amino acids.|$|E
25|$|The spores require warm temperatures, a <b>protein</b> <b>source,</b> an {{anaerobic}} environment, {{and moisture}} {{in order to}} become active and produce toxin. In the wild, decomposing vegetation and invertebrates combined with warm temperatures can provide ideal conditions for the botulism bacteria to activate and produce toxin that may affect feeding birds and other animals. Spores are not killed by boiling, but botulism is uncommon because special, rarely obtained conditions are necessary for botulinum toxin production from C. botulinum spores, including an anaerobic, low-salt, low-acid, low-sugar environment at ambient temperatures.|$|E

40|$|Novel <b>protein</b> <b>sources</b> (like insects, algae, duckweed, and rapeseed) are {{expected}} to enter the European feed and food market as replacers for animal-derived proteins. However, food safety aspects of these novel <b>protein</b> <b>sources</b> are not well-known. The aim {{of this article is}} to review the state of the art on the safety of major novel <b>protein</b> <b>sources</b> for feed and food production, in particular insects, algae (microalgae and seaweed), duckweed, and rapeseed. Potential hazards for these <b>protein</b> <b>sources</b> are described and EU legislative requirements as regard to food and feed safety are explained. Potential hazards may include a range of contaminants, like heavy metals, mycotoxins, pesticide residues, as well as pathogens. Some safety aspects of novel <b>protein</b> <b>sources</b> are intrinsic to the product, but many potential hazards can also be due to production methods and processing conditions. These aspects should be considered in advance during product development. European law is unclear on several issues regarding the use of novel <b>protein</b> <b>sources</b> in food and feed products. For food product applications, the most important question for food producers is whether or not the product is considered a novel food. One of the major unclarities for feed applications is whether or not products with insects are considered animal-derived products or not. Due to the unclarities in European law, it is not always clear which Regulation and maximum levels for contaminants apply. For market introduction, European legislation should be adjusted and clarified...|$|R

25|$|Bees collect pollen {{in their}} pollen baskets {{and carry it}} back to the hive. In the hive, pollen is used as a <b>protein</b> <b>source</b> {{necessary}} during brood-rearing. In certain environments, excess pollen can be collected from the hives of A. mellifera and A. cerana. It is often eaten as a health supplement. It also has been used with moderate success as a source of pollen for hand pollination. However, pollen collected by bees and harvested for pollination must be used within a few hours because it loses its potency rapidly, possibly because of the effects of enzymes or other chemicals from the bees.|$|E
25|$|Honey bees obtain all {{of their}} {{nutritional}} requirements from a diverse combination of pollen and nectar. Pollen is the only natural <b>protein</b> <b>source</b> for honey bees. Adult worker honey bees consume 3.4-4.3mg of pollen per day to meet a dry matter requirement of 66-74% protein. The rearing of one larva requires 125-187.5mg pollen or 25-37.5mg protein for proper development. Dietary proteins are broken down into amino acids, ten of which are considered essential to honey bees: methionine, tryptophan, arginine, lysine, histidine, phenylalanine, isoleucine, threonine, leucine, and valine. Of these amino acids, honey bees require highest concentrations of leucine, isoleucine, and valine, however elevated concentrations of arginine and lysine are required for brood rearing. In addition to these amino acids, some B vitamins including biotin, folic acid, nicotinamide, riboflavin, thiamine, pantothenate, and most importantly, pyridoxine are required to rear larvae. Pyridoxine is the most prevalent B vitamin found in royal jelly and concentrations vary throughout the foraging season with lowest concentrations found in May and highest concentrations found in July and August. Honey bees lacking dietary pyridoxine were unable to rear brood.|$|E

An upswing in breastfeeding in many countries has been accompanied by a deferment in the average age of introduction of baby foods (including cow's milk), resulting in both increased breastfeeding and increased use of infant formula between the ages of 3- and 12-months.|$|E
