2500|$|Although orders {{returning}} {{cases to}} state courts usually cannot be reviewed on appeal, federal circuit courts of appeals may consider appeals involving the Class Action Fairness Act. Dart Cherokee filed a <b>petition</b> <b>for</b> <b>review</b> pursuant to this exception in United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, but the Tenth Circuit denied their petition. Dart Cherokee then filed a petition for en banc review, but a divided panel of Tenth Circuit judges denied Dart Cherokee's petition. Judge Harris Hartz filed an opinion dissenting from denial of review en banc, {{in which he}} argued the Tenth Circuit's requirements for notices of removal were [...] "even more onerous than the code pleading requirements that I had thought the federal courts abandoned long ago". Judge Hartz concluded the Tenth Circuit had an [...] "obligation" [...] to grant review en banc [...] "to provide clarity in this important area of the law". After the Tenth Circuit denied review en banc, Dart Cherokee filed a petition for certiorari in the Supreme Court of the United States, which was granted on April 7, 2014. The Supreme Court later stated that the Court granted certiorari to resolve a circuit split.|$|E
2500|$|An {{applicant}} initially presents {{his claim}} to an asylum officer, who may either grant asylum or refer the application to an Immigration Judge. If the asylum officer refers the application and the applicant is not legally authorized {{to remain in the}} United States, the applicant is placed in removal proceedings. After a hearing, an immigration judge determines whether the applicant is eligible for asylum. The immigration judge's decision is subject to review on two, and possibly three, levels. First, the immigration judge's decision can be appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals. [...] In 2002, in order to eliminate the backlog of appeals from immigration judges, the Attorney General streamlined review procedures at the Board of Immigration Appeals. One member of the Board can affirm a decision of an immigration judge without oral argument; traditional review by three-judge panels is restricted to limited categories for which [...] "searching appellate review" [...] is appropriate. If the BIA affirms the decision of the immigration court, then the next level of review is a <b>petition</b> <b>for</b> <b>review</b> in the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which the immigration judge sits. The court of appeals reviews the case to determine if [...] "substantial evidence" [...] supports the immigration judge's (or the BIA's) decision. [...] As the Supreme Court held in INS v. Ventura, , if the federal appeals court determines that substantial evidence does not support the immigration judge's decision, it must remand the case to the BIA for further proceedings instead of deciding the unresolved legal issue in the first instance. [...] Finally, an applicant aggrieved by a decision of the federal appeals court can petition the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case by a discretionary writ of certiorari. [...] But the Supreme Court has no duty to review an immigration case, and so many applicants for asylum forego this final step.|$|E
