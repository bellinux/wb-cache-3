Assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) make <b>post-menopausal</b> <b>pregnancy</b> physiologically plausible, however, one must consider the associated physical, psychological, and sociological factors involved. Methods: A quasi-systematic review was conducted in PubMed and Ovid using the key terms post-menopause, pregnancy + MeSH terms [donations, hormone replacement therapy, assisted reproductive technologies, embryo donation, donor artificial insemination, cryopreservation]. Overall, 28 papers encompassing two major themes (ethical and medical) {{were included in the}} review. Conclusion: There are significant ethical considerations and medical (maternal and fetal) complications related to pregnancy in peri- and post-menopausal women. When examining the ethical and sociological perspective, the literature portrays an overall positive attitude toward pregnancy in advanced maternal age. With respect to the medical complications, the general consensus in the evaluated studies suggests that there is greater risk of complication for spontaneous pregnancy when the mother is older (eg, > 35 years old). This risk can be mitigated by careful medical screening of the mother and the use of ARTs in healthy women. In these instances, a woman of advanced maternal age who is otherwise healthy can carry a pregnancy with a similar risk profile to that of her younger counterparts when using donated oocytes.

For reference purposes, determinations were done in the plasma of normal males, normal menstruating women, women {{at different stages of}} <b>pregnancy,</b> <b>post-menopausal</b> women, and women using ethinylestradiol (EE 2) 0. 050 mg daily. The progestational compounds, d-norgestrel (0. 030 mg daily), lynestrenol (0. 5 mg daily), and medroxyprogesterone acetate (150 mg three-monthly intramuscularly), caused a decrease of about 30...|$|R
40|$|Background: Pyomyoma is a {{life-threatening}} complication of uterine leiomyoma. It may occur in <b>post-menopausal</b> women, during <b>pregnancy</b> {{and in the}} postpartum period. Fever {{may be the only}} manifestation during {{the early stages of the}} disease. We detail the first reported case of postpartum pyomyoma-related sepsis due to Sphingomonas paucimobilis, a Gram-negative bacillus that is gaining recognition as an important human pathogen. Case presentation: A woman presented with an asymptomatic uterine fibroid and a two-week history of fever during the postpartum period. Suppurative uterine leiomyoma was diagnosed, and blood cultures grew Sphingomonas paucimobilis. The myoma was surgically removed from the uterus without hysterectomy. Intravenous antimicrobial therapy was given for fifteen days, and the patient was discharged from hospital in good condition. Conclusion: Pyomyoma should be considered in broad differential diagnosis of postpartum fever. This case highlights a unique disease manifestation of S. paucimobilis, an emerging opportunistic pathogen with increasing significance in the nosocomial setting...|$|R
