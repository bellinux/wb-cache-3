5|$|The <b>prints</b> <b>were</b> {{intended}} {{as a form of}} moral instruction; Hogarth was dismayed by the routine acts of cruelty he witnessed on the streets of London. Issued on cheap paper, the <b>prints</b> <b>were</b> destined for the lower classes. The series shows a roughness of execution and a brutality that is untempered by the funny touches common in Hogarth's other works, but which he felt was necessary to impress his message on the intended audience. Nevertheless, the pictures still carry the wealth of detail and subtle references that are characteristic of Hogarth.|$|E
5|$|Escher worked {{primarily}} in the media of lithographs and woodcuts, though the few mezzotints he made {{are considered to be}} masterpieces of the technique. In his graphic art, he portrayed mathematical relationships among shapes, figures and space. Integrated into his <b>prints</b> <b>were</b> mirror images of cones, spheres, cubes, rings and spirals.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, Ian Levine located another 65 episodes {{from the}} show's first six seasons (plus {{fourteen}} previously existing episodes), at the BBC Enterprises film vault at Villiers House in London. The episodes comprise 17 full serials, mostly from seasons 1 and 2. According to Levine, {{many of the}} <b>prints</b> <b>were</b> flagged to be junked that very day.|$|E

50|$|As a curiosum {{it can be}} {{mentioned}} that Bad Afro Records since the beginning as a vinyl based record label has had a policy that {{makes it easy to}} tell the difference between first print of the LP’s or 7” singles and later <b>prints.</b> First <b>print</b> <b>is</b> on black vinyl, second <b>print</b> <b>is</b> on red vinyl, 3rd <b>print</b> <b>is</b> on green vinyl and 4th <b>print</b> <b>is</b> on purple vinyl.|$|R
5|$|Some {{overseas}} viewing <b>prints</b> <b>were</b> physically {{edited for}} content by local censor boards, before transmission for reasons such as excessive violence, fright-inducing material, and, in some cases, the conservative personal {{views of the}} censors. Hence, episodes recovered from these sources (Australia, New Zealand) are missing these segments.|$|E
5|$|The film premiered at the Pavilion Theatre in London on 6 July 1964—the eve of Ringo Starr's 24th birthday—and {{the soundtrack}} was {{released}} four days later. A Hard Day's Night set records at the London Pavilion by grossing over $20,000 {{in the first}} week, ultimately becoming so popular that more than 1,600 <b>prints</b> <b>were</b> in circulation simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|A {{few years}} later, {{inspired}} by Madame de Genlis's Adèle et Théodore (1782), Trimmer commissioned sets of illustrations of the Bible {{for which she}} provided the commentary; she also published print/commentary sets of ancient history and British history. These various sets were very popular and could be purchased together (commentary and prints) or individually. The <b>prints</b> <b>were</b> usually hung on walls or bound into books.|$|E
50|$|The <b>prints</b> <b>are</b> {{produced}} by Cone Editions Press (by Jon Cone). These <b>prints</b> <b>are</b> {{of the highest}} printing quality.|$|R

50|$|When {{the last}} answer <b>print</b> <b>is</b> {{approved}} and finalized, {{it is used}} to make an internegative from which the release <b>prints</b> <b>are</b> struck.|$|R
5|$|Four hundred <b>prints</b> <b>were</b> sold, so {{many that}} the negatives wore out twice, {{requiring}} the film to be re-shot each time. Two professional actors were paid to appear, and the film is cited as the first film to have used paid actors. The style of shooting and editing would {{bridge the gap between}} the styles of directors Edwin Stanton Porter and D. W. Griffith, and prints have been preserved in both the United States and the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|In shots {{where there}} was no {{perspective}} change, still shots of the models were photographed and positive paper <b>prints</b> <b>were</b> made. The image of the model was cut out of the photographic print and mounted on glass and filmed on an animation stand. The undeveloped film was re-wound to film the star background with the silhouette of the model photograph acting as a matte to block out where the spaceship image was.|$|E
5|$|Rescued by Rover {{is often}} {{considered}} to be the United Kingdom's first major fiction film. Some four hundred <b>prints</b> <b>were</b> sold at a price of £8 each, and they circulated for at least four or five years. The character of Rover the dog, played by Hepworth's family dog Blair, became a household name and is considered the world's first canine film star. This first appearance of a dog in a narrative based film caused the uncommon name of Rover to become popular for dogs.|$|E
5000|$|Fancy print—created by {{printing}} {{patterns on}} cloth. Unlike expensive wax <b>prints,</b> the design <b>is</b> <b>printed</b> {{on one side}} of the cotton fabric. Fancy <b>prints</b> <b>are</b> made in Europe, India, and West Africa. The most popular fancy <b>print</b> <b>is</b> known as the traditional print.|$|R
50|$|Digital <b>printing</b> <b>is</b> {{a process}} in which <b>prints</b> <b>are</b> {{directly}} applied to fabrics with printer, reducing 95% the use of water, 75% the use of energy, and minimizing textile waste. The main advantage of digital <b>printing</b> <b>is</b> the ability to do very small runs of each design (even less than 1 yard).|$|R
50|$|A canvas <b>print</b> <b>is</b> {{the result}} of an image printed onto canvas which is stretched, or gallery-wrapped, onto a frame and displayed. Canvas <b>prints</b> <b>are</b> often used in {{interior}} design, with stock images, or customised with personal photographs. Canvas <b>prints</b> <b>are</b> intended to reproduce the look of original oil or acrylic paintings on stretched canvas.|$|R
5|$|Special {{consideration}} {{was given}} during filming {{to allow for}} integration of the planned special effects. Television monitors standing in for computer displays were specially calibrated so that their refresh rate {{did not result in}} banding on film. Due to a loss of resolution and quality resulting from rephotographing an element in an optical printer, live action sequences for effects were shot in 65mm or VistaVision formats to compensate. When the larger <b>prints</b> <b>were</b> reduced through an anamorphic lens on the printer, the result was a Panavision composite.|$|E
5|$|The composited camera {{negative}} of Citizen Kane {{was destroyed}} in a New Jersey film laboratory fire in the 1970s. Subsequent <b>prints</b> <b>were</b> derived from a master positive (a fine-grain preservation element) made in the 1940s and originally intended for use in overseas distribution. Modern techniques were used to produce a pristine print for a 50th Anniversary theatrical reissue in 1991 which Paramount released for then-owner Turner Broadcasting System, which earned $1.6 million in North America.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} internationally and attracted large audiences and positive reviews, though some criticized it for commercializing the tragedy {{so soon after}} the event. It is now regarded as a lost film, as the last known <b>prints</b> <b>were</b> destroyed in an Éclair studio fire in March 1914. Only a few printed stills and promotional photos are known to survive. It is Gibson's penultimate film, as she reportedly suffered a mental breakdown after completing it.|$|E
50|$|The {{defining}} {{characteristic of}} a contact <b>print</b> <b>is</b> that the resulting <b>print</b> <b>is</b> {{the same size as}} the original, rather than having been projected through an enlarger.|$|R
5000|$|... 1839: Salt printThis was {{the most}} {{dominant}} form of paper print until Albumen <b>prints</b> <b>was</b> introduced in 1850. Salt <b>prints</b> <b>was</b> made using both paper and glass negatives.|$|R

5|$|After Méliès's {{financial}} difficulties and decline, most {{copies of his}} <b>prints</b> <b>were</b> lost. In 1917, his offices were occupied by the French military, who melted down many of Méliès's films to gather the traces of silver from the film stock and make boot heels from the celluloid. When the Théâtre Robert-Houdin was demolished in 1923, the prints kept there were sold by weight to a vendor of second-hand film. Finally, in that same year, Méliès had a moment of anger and burned all his remaining negatives in his garden in Montreuil. In 1925, he began selling toys and candy from a stand in the Gare Montparnasse in Paris. A Trip to the Moon was largely forgotten to history and went unseen for years.|$|E
5|$|After the {{six years}} of absolutism that {{followed}} Ferdinand's return to the throne on 1 January 1820, Rafael del Riego initiated an army revolt {{with the intent of}} restoring the 1812 Constitution. By March, the king was forced to agree, but by September 1823, after an unstable period, a French invasion supported by an alliance of the major powers had removed the constitutional government. The last <b>prints</b> <b>were</b> probably not completed until after the Constitution was restored, though certainly before Goya left Spain in May 1824. Their balance of optimism and cynicism makes it difficult to relate them directly to particular moments in these rapidly moving events.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, Bauer {{was asked}} by the Åhlén & Åkerlund {{publishing}} house (now Bonnier Group) to illustrate their new series of books, Among Gnomes and Trolls. The books would be published annually, and contain stories by prominent Swedish authors. The majority of Bauer's pictures for the book were full-page watercolor illustrations in a muted color scheme; he also contributed with covers, vignettes and other smaller illustrations. Bauer's most significant creatures, the trolls, were rendered in shades of gray, green, and brown, the colors of the forests, as if these beings had grown from the landscape itself. Due to the limitiations of the technology available to his printers, the 1907–10 editions were produced in just two colors: black and yellow. Some of Bauer's original paintings for these <b>prints</b> <b>were</b> in full color.|$|E
50|$|Among librarians Large <b>Print</b> <b>is</b> {{defined as}} <b>print</b> that <b>is</b> at least 18 points in size.|$|R
50|$|The {{first edition}} <b>was</b> <b>printed</b> in 1960. A second <b>printing</b> <b>was</b> made in 1962 and a revised edition <b>was</b> <b>printed</b> in 1963.|$|R
50|$|Vintage <b>prints</b> <b>are</b> {{considered}} the original piece of art, {{as it is}} possible to arbitrarily obtain many copies from the same negative. This means that vintage <b>prints</b> <b>are</b> often signed by the photographer.|$|R
5|$|In 1975 American mycologist Martina S. Gilliam {{investigated}} the periodicity of spore release in M.rotula {{and concluded that}} spore discharge did not follow a regular circadian rhythm, as is typical of agaric and bolete mushrooms, but rather was dependent on rain. A threshold of rainfall is required to elicit a spore discharge response and the duration of peak spore discharge correlates {{with the amount of}} rainfall, rather than its duration. Furthermore, Gilliam noted that spore <b>prints</b> <b>were</b> more readily obtained if the stem ends were placed in water, suggesting that water must enter through the fruit body for discharge to occur.|$|E
5|$|Reproductive {{rights to}} the {{painting}} were acquired by Zagreb merchant Petar Nikolić shortly after its creation, and lithographic <b>prints</b> <b>were</b> published soon thereafter. The painting was owned by the French Gallery until 1893, when it was purchased by a London buyer. In 1935, the Yugoslav Ministry of Foreign Affairs purchased the work {{and gave it to}} the National Museum of Serbia, in whose possession it remains. It is classified under inventory number 31–115. The museum has been closed to the public since the early 2000s, pending renovation. This has not kept Jovanović's works, including Decorating of the Bride, from being displayed at other venues, including the National Museum's foyer, which is sometimes open to the public.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} assumed to have been lost for many years until a paper copy was {{identified}} in 1968 in the Library of Congress Paper Print archive by Michael Pointer, a historian of Sherlock Holmes films. Because motion pictures were not covered by copyright laws until 1912, paper <b>prints</b> <b>were</b> submitted by studios wishing to register their works. These were made using light-sensitive paper of the same width and length as the film itself, and developed as though a still photograph. Both the Edison Company and the Biograph Company submitted entire motion pictures as paper prints, {{and it is in}} this form that most of them survive. The film has subsequently been transferred to 16 mm film in the Library of Congress collection.|$|E
5000|$|A {{substantially}} longer <b>print</b> <b>was</b> {{shown in}} test screening in Texas and in Washington State before general release, but the [...] "restored" [...] DVD <b>print</b> <b>is</b> still missing {{much of the}} test print material.|$|R
5000|$|The {{film was}} {{restored}} by the UCLA Film & Television Archive, with funding provided by The Film Foundation and The Franco-American Cultural Fund. [...] A fine-grain <b>print</b> <b>was</b> recently struck {{from the original}} nitrate negative, from which a new negative and superb new <b>print</b> <b>were</b> produced. Among other earlier exhibitions, the new <b>print</b> <b>was</b> exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City in November 2014.|$|R
5000|$|Original copies have no barcode and the CD <b>printing</b> <b>is</b> in blue. The second NUMA reissue is barcoded, has a {{different}} rear picture sleeve and the CD <b>printing</b> <b>is</b> in black. The catalogue numbers are identical.|$|R
