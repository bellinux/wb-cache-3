This role includes the investigation of certain types of incidents arising out of or in connection with work activities. These may include some accidents, dangerous occurrences or cases of ill health. HSE’s role in an investigation {{is to find out}} what happened, and whether any health and safety law has been broken.

Making a victim <b>personal</b> <b>statement</b> This leaflet explains how you can make a victim <b>personal</b> <b>statement.</b> It tells you what sort of information you might want to include in your statement, and what we will do with that information. What is a victim <b>personal</b> <b>statement?</b> A victim <b>personal</b> <b>statement</b> gives you the chance to tell us about how the incident has affected you (for example, you could have been affected physically, emotionally or financially). You can also use your victim <b>personal</b> <b>statement</b> to inform us about things such as any support you might need, and how you wish to be kept {{up to date on the}} progress of the case.

25|$|Craig {{argues that}} the best {{explanation}} of these three events is that God raised Jesus from the dead. He rejects alternative theories such as Lüdemann's hallucination hypothesis as lacking explanatory scope, explanatory power, and sufficient historical knowledge to support the psychoanalysis Lüdemann performs. Craig's historical case for the resurrection employ's standard historical practices for weighing historical hypotheses concluding that the resurrection is a better match to the available historical data. Specifically, Craig argues, that if one does not begin {{with the assumption that}} there is no God, there is a higher probability of the resurrection hypothesis than of its negation, so the resurrection hypothesis is improbable only if one begins with unsupported assumptions. Craig also notes that a miraculous explanation of the evidence is increased when one locates the resurrection of Jesus in the context of Jesus' ministry and <b>personal</b> <b>statements.</b> This context, Craig argues, provides the interpretive key to the meaning of Jesus' resurrection as the divine vindication of the allegedly blasphemous statements for which Jesus was tried and executed.|$|E

She found the task challenging since [...] "thematically the songs—the old and the new—they have to go together; sonically they have to go together." [...] The romantic and party theme of the show was an expansion of the name Rebel Heart, representing a journey with her <b>personal</b> <b>statements</b> and opinions. Love and romance were listed as the central theme of the show, with Madonna wanting the audience to feel inspired once they watch it. Along with it, she juxtaposed opposite ideas of sexuality and religion, saying that [...] "I'm very immersed in [...] not supposed to go together, but in my world it goes together". Inspirations for Rebel Heart Tour also came from shows like Cirque du Soleil and the Chinese New Year, as well as films like 300 and Grease. Jamie King esd the creative director for the show, while Megan Lawson and Jason Young choreographed the 20 dancers through intricate acrobatic dance steps. According to Madonna, since she started out as a dancer, for the tour she tried to find [...] "unique and original dancers to work with" [...] and create content and dance-forms that would inspire the audience.|$|E
