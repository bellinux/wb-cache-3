25|$|Emissions are {{inherent}} to the combustion of diesel fuels that are {{regulated by the}} U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (E.P.A.). As these emissions are a byproduct of the combustion process, {{in order to ensure}} E.P.A. compliance a fuel system must be capable of controlling the combustion of fuels as well as the mitigation of emissions. There are a number of new technologies being phased in to control the production of diesel emissions. The exhaust gas recirculation system, E.G.R., and the diesel <b>particulate</b> <b>filter,</b> D.P.F., are both designed to mitigate the production of harmful emissions.|$|E
25|$|The main {{change for}} the 2012 models was the {{installation}} of a different engine from the Ford Duratorq engine range. Ford decided, due to cost reasons, not to modify the 2.4-litre engine introduced in 2007 to meet the upcoming Euro V emissions standards and so the engine was replaced with the ZSD-422 engine, essentially a 2.2-litre variant of the same engine. Although smaller than the existing unit the power and torque outputs remained unchanged and the same six-speed gearbox was used as well. The engine included a diesel <b>particulate</b> <b>filter</b> {{for the first time}} on a Defender. The only other change was the reintroduction of the soft top body style to the general market. This had been a popular option for the Land Rover Series but by the introduction of the Defender had been relegated to special order and military buyers only. Land Rover stated that the option was being brought back due to customer feedback.|$|E

These <b>particulate</b> <b>filters</b> have a mechanism, which is affected by diesel sulfur level. My study refers to the effect with which the sulfur in diesel affects the regeneration rate of the diesel <b>particulate</b> <b>filters.</b> Two filters with different coatings were taken. Diesel Sulfur with different concentrations was tested. It was observed that there was linear relation between sulfur level and balance point temperature.

5000|$|Technologies {{are also}} in {{development}} to reduce some of the 133,000 metric tons of particulate matter emitted each year from ships. [...] Ocean vessels use diesel engines, and <b>particulate</b> <b>filters</b> {{similar to those in}} use for land vehicles are now being tested on them. As with current <b>particulate</b> <b>filters</b> these too would require the ships to use ULSD, but if comparable emissions reductions are attainable, up to 120,000 metric tons of particulate emissions could be eliminated each year from international shipping. That is, if <b>particulate</b> <b>filters</b> could be shown reduce black carbon emissions 90 percent from ships as they do for land vehicles, 120,000 metric tons of today’s 133,000 metric tons of emissions would be prevented. Other efforts can reduce the amount of black carbon emissions from ships simply by decreasing the amount of fuel the ships use. By traveling at slower speeds or by using shore side electricity when at port instead of running the ship’s diesel engines for electric power, ships can save fuel and reduce emissions.|$|R

50|$|The {{quality of}} the fuel also {{influences}} the formation of these particles. For example, a high sulfur content diesel produces more particles.
