5|$|Air {{contains}} water vapor, and {{the amount}} of water in a given mass of dry air, known as the mixing ratio, is measured in grams of water per kilogram of dry air (g/kg). The amount of moisture in air is also commonly reported as relative humidity; which is the percentage of the total water vapor air can hold at a particular air temperature. How much water vapor a <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> can contain before it becomes saturated (100%relative humidity) and forms into a cloud (a group of visible and tiny water and ice particles suspended above the Earth's surface) depends on its temperature. Warmer air can contain more water vapor than cooler air before becoming saturated. Therefore, one way to saturate a <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> is to cool it. The dew point is the temperature to which a parcel must be cooled in order to become saturated.|$|E
5|$|Dew {{point is}} the {{temperature}} to which a given <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> must be cooled, at constant atmospheric pressure, for water vapor to condense into water. The condensed water is called dew. The dew point is a saturation point. When the dew point temperature falls below freezing {{it is called the}} frost point, as the water vapor no longer creates dew but instead creates frost or hoarfrost by deposition. The dew point is associated with relative humidity. A high relative humidity indicates that the dew point is closer to the current air temperature. If the relative humidity is 100%, the dew point is equal to the current temperature. Given a constant dew point, an increase in temperature will lead to a decrease in relative humidity. At a given barometric pressure, independent of temperature, the dew point determines the specific humidity of the air. The dew point is an important statistic for general aviation pilots, as it is used to calculate the likelihood of carburetor icing and fog. When used with the air temperature, a formula can be used to estimate the height of cumuliform, or convective, clouds.|$|E

25|$|However, the {{pressure}} force must exactly counterbalance the Coriolis force anyway, so the <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> needs {{to travel with}} the Coriolis force contrary to the decreasing sideways slope of pressure.|$|E
25|$|In {{atmospheric}} science, {{balanced flow}} is an idealisation of atmospheric motion. The idealisation consists {{in considering the}} behaviour of one isolated <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> having constant density, its motion on a horizontal plane subject to selected forces acting on it and, finally, steady-state conditions.|$|E

50|$|When a <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> rises, it expands, {{because the}} {{pressure}} is lower at higher altitudes. As the air parcel expands, it pushes the surrounding air outward, transferring {{energy in the form}} of work from that parcel to the atmosphere. As energy transfer to a <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> by way of heat is very slow, it is assumed to not exchange energy by way of heat with the environment. Such a process is called an adiabatic process (no energy transfer by way of heat). Since the rising <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> is losing energy as it does work on the surrounding atmosphere and no energy is transferred into it as heat from the atmosphere {{to make up for the}} loss, the <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> is losing energy, which manifests itself as a decrease in the temperature of the air parcel. The reverse, of course, will be true for a <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> that is sinking and is being compressed.|$|E
50|$|A rising <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> {{containing}} water vapor, if {{it rises}} far enough, reaches its lifted condensation level: it becomes saturated with water vapor (see Clausius-Clapeyron relation). If the <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> continues to rise, water vapor condenses and releases its latent heat {{to the surrounding}} air, partially offsetting the adiabatic cooling. A saturated <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> therefore cools less than a dry one would as it rises (its temperature changes with height at the moist adiabatic lapse rate, which is smaller than the dry adiabatic lapse rate). Such a saturated <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> can achieve buoyancy, and thus accelerate further upward, a runaway condition (instability) even if potential temperature increases with height. The sufficient condition for an air column to be absolutely stable, even with respect to saturated convective motions, is that the equivalent potential temperature must increase monotonically with height.|$|E

5000|$|Basic or popular sources often {{describe}} the [...] "equal transit-time" [...] theory of lift, which incorrectly {{assumes that the}} <b>parcels</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> that divide {{at the leading edge}} of an airfoil must rejoin at the trailing edge, forcing the air traveling along the longer upper surface to go faster. Bernoulli's Principle is then cited to conclude that since the air moves slower along the bottom of the wing, the air pressure must be higher, pushing the wing up.|$|R
5000|$|When air rises, {{moist air}} cools {{at a lower}} rate than dry air. That is, for the same {{vertical}} movement, a <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> moist <b>air</b> will be warmer than a <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> dry <b>air.</b> This {{is because of the}} condensation of water vapor in the air parcel due to expansion cooling. As water vapor condenses, latent heat is released into the air parcel. Moist air has more water vapor than dry air, so more latent heat is released into the <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> moist <b>air</b> as it rises. Dry air does not have as much water vapor, therefore dry air cools at a higher rate with vertical movement than moist air. As a result of the latent heat that is released during water vapor condensation, moist air has a relatively lower adiabatic lapse rate than dry air. This makes moist air generally less stable than dry air (see convective available potential energy CAPE). The dry adiabatic lapse rate (for unsaturated air) is [...] per 1,000 vertical feet (300 m). The moist adiabatic lapse rate varies from [...] per 1,000 vertical feet (300 m).|$|R
50|$|Observations of {{low-level}} vorticity couplets within RFDs {{indicate that}} tilting of vorticity by the RFD {{is important in}} the formation of tornadoes within supercell storms. During the tornadogenesis phase in supercells, the <b>parcels</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> infiltrating the tornado or incipient tornado regularly seem to pass through the hook echo and RFD, which can {{serve as the basis for}} Fujita's recycling hypothesis. Furthermore, observations of the clear slot during and just prior to the tornadic stage, imply the air infiltrating the tornado may come from the RFD.|$|R
50|$|Adiabatic heating {{occurs in}} the Earth's {{atmosphere}} when an air mass descends, for example, in a katabatic wind, Foehn wind, or chinook wind flowing downhill over a mountain range. When a <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> descends, {{the pressure on the}} parcel increases. Due to this increase in pressure, the parcel's volume decreases and its temperature increases as work is done on the <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> <b>air,</b> thus increasing its internal energy, which manifests itself by a rise in the temperature of that mass of air. The <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> can only slowly dissipate the energy by conduction or radiation (heat), and to a first approximation it can be considered adiabatically isolated and the process an adiabatic process.|$|E
5000|$|Specific {{humidity}} (or moisture content) is {{the ratio}} of the mass of water vapor to the total mass of the moist air parcel. Specific humidity is approximately equal to the [...] "mixing ratio", which is defined as {{the ratio of}} the mass of water vapor in an air parcel to the mass of dry air for the same parcel. As temperature decreases, the amount of water vapor needed to reach saturation also decreases. As the temperature of a <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> becomes lower it will eventually reach the point of saturation without adding or losing water mass. The differences in the amount of water vapor in a <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> can be quite large, for example; A <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> that is near saturation may contain 28 grams of water per cubic meter of air at 30 °C, but only 8 grams of water per cubic meter of air at 8 °C.|$|E

50|$|The Walker circulation, {{also known}} as the Walker cell, is a {{conceptual}} model <b>of</b> the <b>air</b> flow in the tropics in the lower atmosphere (troposphere). According to this model, <b>parcels</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> follow a closed circulation in the zonal and vertical directions. This circulation, which is roughly consistent with observations, is caused by differences in heat distribution between ocean and land. It was discovered by Gilbert Walker. In addition to motions in the zonal and vertical direction the tropical atmosphere also has considerable motion in the meridional direction as part of, for example, the Hadley Circulation.|$|R

The purpose of using such a precise anemometer is to measure value of the wind velocity component in three dimensions. Using the infrared gas analyzer and the humidity sensor, the concentration of water vapor and trace gases in the air sample is measured and sent to a computer which quickly figures out the mass flux of the gas in question. This mass flux makes the FluxNet project a valuable tool to scientists trying to monitor long term changes in trace gas flux within the atmosphere.|$|R

This is a foehn type of wind. The characteristics of the environment during zonda wind events are described using the 40 km regional Eta model outputs. Isentropic surfaces show that the <b>parcels</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> transposing the Andes can dive from about 600 hPa to 850 hPa to the lee side, in a hydraulic jump resemblance.

50|$|However, when air is hot, {{it tends}} to expand, which lowers its density. Thus, hot air tends to rise and {{transfer}} heat upward. This {{is the process of}} convection. Convection comes to equilibrium when a <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> at a given altitude has the same density as its surroundings. Air is a poor conductor of heat, so a <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> will rise and fall without exchanging heat. This is known as an adiabatic process, which has a characteristic pressure-temperature curve. As the pressure gets lower, the temperature decreases. The rate of decrease of temperature with elevation is known as the adiabatic lapse rate, which is approximately 9.8 °C per kilometer (or 5.4 °F per 1000 feet) of altitude.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{break-up}} of the Antarctic vortex on the water vapor distribution are studied using MLS measurements of water vapor made during September 1991 and November 1991. In early November at 22 hPa a moist area is found within the polar vortex, consistent with an observed descent of order 10 km and strong radiative cooling. As the vortex erodes (beginning <b>of</b> November 1991), <b>parcels</b> <b>of</b> moist <b>air</b> become detached {{from the edge of}} the vortex and mix rapidly (within 2 - 3 days) with drier mid-latitude air. When the vortex breaks up (mid-November), larger <b>parcels</b> <b>of</b> moist <b>air</b> from both the edge and the inner vortex migrate to mid-latitudes. These parcels have a longer lifetime than those produced by vortex erosion, probably because they are correlated with higher potential vorticity gradients.

40|$|Typhoon Winnie (1997) was {{the fourth}} supertyphoon in the western North Pacific in 1997. In its mature stage, an outer eyewall, {{consisting}} of deep convection with a diameter of 370 km, was observed by satellite and radar. Within this unusually large outer eyewall existed an inner eyewall, which consisted of a ring of shallow clouds with a diameter of similar to 50 km. In this study, Typhoon Winnie is simulated using a nested-grid version of the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University-National Center for Atmospheric Research (PSU-NCAR) Mesoscale Model (MM 5) with an inner grid length of 9 kin. The model reproduces an outer cloud eyewall with a diameter of similar to 350 km. The simulated radar reflectivity and hourly precipitation are verified with satellite microwave, infrared, and cloud brightness temperature images. Analysis of the model results indicates that the large outer eyewall in many ways possesses {{the structure of a}} typical hurricane eyewall. This includes strong tangential winds and radial inflow Outside the eyewall as well as an extremely large horizontal wind shear right at the eyewall. The outer eyewall is characterized with a ring of high vorticity (RHV). This RHV is closely related to a ring of high convergence (RHC). This RHC is caused by organized convective systems along the eyewall. The eye simulated by Winnie is characterized by a broad region of warm, dry slowly sinking air. The factors determining the diameter of eyes in tropical cyclones are discussed by considering the scale of the environmental angular momentum and the maximum kinetic energy achieved by <b>parcels</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> originating in the environment and reaching the radius of maximum wind.
