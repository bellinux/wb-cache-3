5|$|Studies {{evaluating}} {{the effect of}} circumcision on the incidence of other sexually transmitted infections have reached conflicting conclusions. A 2006 meta-analysis found that circumcision was associated with lower rates of syphilis, chancroid and possibly genital herpes. A 2010 review found that circumcision reduced the incidence of HSV-2 (herpes simplex virus, type 2) infections by 28%. The researchers found mixed results for <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> trichomonas vaginalis and chlamydia trachomatis and no evidence of <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> gonorrhea or syphilis. Among {{men who have sex}} with men, reviews have found poor evidence for <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> sexually transmitted infections other than HIV, with the possible exception of syphilis.|$|E

5|$|Another viable use {{of custom}} allocators is for {{debugging}} memory-related errors.

5|$|As with FreeBSD and OpenBSD, the {{developers}} of DragonFly BSD are slowly replacing K style C code with more modern, ANSI equivalents. Similar to other operating systems, DragonFly's {{version of the}} GNU Compiler Collection has an enhancement called the Stack-Smashing Protector (ProPolice) enabled by default, providing some additional <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> buffer overflow based attacks.

Caerphilly's water defences provided particular <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> mining, which could otherwise undermine castle walls during the period, and are considered the most advanced of their kind in Britain.|$|E

The two green vegetables were the only ones mentioned specifically in the laws, though uncultivated plants were still likely to be used in their cooking. The leek went on to be so important to Welsh cuisine—found in many symbolic dishes including cawl and Glamorgan sausage—that it became the country's national vegetable.|$|E
5|$|Cnidarians feed {{in several}} ways: predation, {{absorbing}} dissolved organic chemicals, filtering food particles {{out of the}} water, obtaining nutrients from symbiotic algae within their cells, and parasitism. Most obtain {{the majority of their}} food from predation but some, including the corals Hetroxenia and Leptogorgia, depend almost completely on their endosymbionts and on absorbing dissolved nutrients. Cnidaria give their symbiotic algae carbon dioxide, some nutrients, a place in the sun and <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> predators.|$|E
