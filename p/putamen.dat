5|$|The basal ganglia, {{also called}} basal nuclei, are {{a set of}} {{structures}} deep within the hemispheres involved in behaviour and movement regulation. The largest component is the striatum, others are the globus pallidus, the substantia nigra and the subthalamic nucleus. Part of the dorsal striatum, the <b>putamen,</b> and the globus pallidus, lie separated from the lateral ventricles and thalamus by the internal capsule, whereas the caudate nucleus stretches around and abuts the lateral ventricles on their outer sides.|$|E
5|$|HD {{affects the}} whole brain, but certain areas are more {{vulnerable}} than others. The most prominent early effects are {{in a part of}} the basal ganglia called the neostriatum, which is composed of the caudate nucleus and <b>putamen.</b> Other areas affected include the substantia nigra, layers 3, 5 and 6 of the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, purkinje cells in the cerebellum, lateral tuberal nuclei of the hypothalamus and parts of the thalamus. These areas are affected according to their structure and the types of neurons they contain, reducing in size as they lose cells. Striatal spiny neurons are the most vulnerable, particularly ones with projections towards the external globus pallidus, with interneurons and spiny cells projecting to the internal pallidum being less affected. HD also causes an abnormal increase in astrocytes and activation of the brain's immune cells, microglia.|$|E
5|$|When {{the amount}} of copper in the liver overwhelms the {{proteins}} that normally bind it, it causes oxidative damage through {{a process known as}} Fenton chemistry; this damage eventually leads to chronic active hepatitis, fibrosis (deposition of connective tissue) and cirrhosis. The liver also releases copper into the bloodstream that is not bound to ceruloplasmin. This free copper precipitates throughout the body but particularly in the kidneys, eyes and brain. In the brain, most copper is deposited in the basal ganglia, particularly in the <b>putamen</b> and globus pallidus (together called the lenticular nucleus); these areas normally participate in the coordination of movement as well as playing a significant role in neurocognitive processes such as the processing of stimuli and mood regulation. Damage to these areas, again by Fenton chemistry, produces the neuropsychiatric symptoms seen in Wilson's disease.|$|E
25|$|MRI of the brainoften shows {{high signal}} {{intensity}} in the caudate nucleus and <b>putamen</b> bilaterally on T2-weighted images.|$|E
25|$|With {{the use of}} PET in {{the study}} of late learners, {{regional}} cerebral blood flow (rCBF) distribution {{has been found to be}} comparable between L1 and L2. Repetition of words engages overlapping neural structures across both languages; whereas, differences in neural activation are only observed in the left <b>putamen</b> when individuals repeat words in their second language. The <b>putamen,</b> therefore, plays a critical role because the articulation process places greater demand on brain resources, when one is producing a second language learned late in life.|$|E
25|$|Single neurons in the macaque <b>putamen</b> {{have been}} shown to have visual and {{somatosensory}} responses closely related to those in the polysensory zone of the premotor cortex and area 7b in the parietal lobe.|$|E
25|$|Word {{generation}} tasks including rhyme generation (phonological bases), synonym generation (semantic search bases), and translation (lexical {{access to}} other language) {{are used to}} observe lexical-semantics. Word generation {{has been shown to}} cause significant activation in the left dorsolateral frontal cortex (Brodmann areas 9, 45, 46, 47). Considerable overlie has been found in the frontal areas, regardless of task requirements (rhymes or synonyms) and language used (L1 or L2). Selective activation is observed in the left <b>putamen</b> when words are generated in the second language (i.e. increased rCBF in left <b>putamen</b> resulting from L2-L1 subtractions). Even when the second language is acquired later in life (up to age five), L2 production in highly proficient bilinguals reveals activation of similar brain regions as that in L1.|$|E
25|$|Hypoxic-ischemic {{brain injury}} (HIBI) {{is a form}} of {{cerebral}} hypoxia in which oxygen cannot perfuse to cells in the brain. Lesions in the <b>putamen</b> and thalamus caused by HIBI are primary causes of ADCP and can occur during the prenatal period and shortly after. Lesions that arise after this period typically occur as a result of injury or infections of the brain. 40~50% will have intellectual disability.|$|E
25|$|The {{nomenclature}} of the {{basal ganglia}} {{system and its}} components has always been problematic. Early anatomists, seeing the macroscopic anatomical structure but knowing nothing of the cellular architecture or neurochemistry, grouped together components that are now believed to have distinct functions (such as {{the internal and external}} segments of the globus pallidus), and gave distinct names to components that are now thought to be functionally parts of a single structure (such as the caudate nucleus and <b>putamen).</b>|$|E
25|$|Morphine is the prototypical opioid {{and is the}} {{standard}} against which other opioids are tested. It interacts predominantly with the μ–δ-opioid (Mu-Delta) receptor heteromer. The μ-binding sites are discretely distributed in the human brain, with high densities in the posterior amygdala, hypothalamus, thalamus, nucleus caudatus, <b>putamen,</b> and certain cortical areas. They are also found on the terminal axons of primary afferents within laminae I and II (substantia gelatinosa) of the spinal cord and in the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve.|$|E
25|$|Wood and Reavill (2007) {{reviewed}} {{published and}} unpublished data and proposed that aripiprazole may act essentially as a selective D2 receptor partial agonist without significantly affecting {{most of the}} serotonin receptors at therapeutically relevant doses. A positron emission tomography imaging study found that 10 to 30mg/day aripiprazole resulted in 85 to 93% occupancy of the D2 receptor in various brain areas (<b>putamen,</b> caudate, ventral striatum) versus 54 to 60% occupancy of the 5-HT2A receptor and only 16% occupancy of the 5-HT1A receptor. It {{has been suggested that}} the low occupancy of the 5-HT1A receptor by aripiprazole may have been an erroneous measurement however.|$|E
25|$|To date, TAAR1 {{has been}} {{identified}} and cloned in five different mammal genomes: human, mouse, rat, monkey, and chimpanzee. In rats, mRNA for TAAR1 is found at low to moderate levels in peripheral tissues like the stomach, kidney, and lungs, and at low levels in the brain. Rhesus monkey Taar1 and human TAAR1 (hTAAR1) share high sequence similarity, and TAAR1 mRNA is highly expressed in the same important monoaminergic regions of both species. These regions include the dorsal and ventral caudate nucleus, <b>putamen,</b> substantia nigra, nucleus accumbens, ventral tegmental area, locus coeruleus, amygdala, and raphe nucleus. TAAR1 has also been identified in human astrocytes.|$|E
25|$|With {{the use of}} {{positron}} {{emission tomography}} (PET), {{research has shown that}} brain regions active during translation are outside classical language areas. Translating from L1 to L2 and vice versa activates the anterior cingulate and bilateral subcortical structures (i.e. <b>putamen</b> and head of caudate nucleus). This pattern is explained in terms of the need for greater coordination of mental operations. More specifically, automated circuits are favoured over cerebral pathways for naming words. Language switching is another task in which brain activation is high in Broca's area and the supramarginal gyrus. This was originally observed by Poetzl, (1925, 1930) and Leischner, (1943)—all of whom reported that patients with supramarginal lesions were defective in switching languages.|$|E
25|$|The {{disease is}} {{characterized}} further by the gradual onset of defects in behavior and cognition, including dementia and speech impediments, {{beginning in the}} fourth or fifth decades of life. Death usually occurs within 10–20 years after a progressive worsening of symptoms. Caused by the Huntingtin gene, the disease eventually contributes to selective atrophy of the Caudate nucleus and <b>Putamen,</b> especially of GABAergic and acetylcholinergic neurons, with some additional degeneration of the frontal and temporal cortices of the brain. The disrupted signaling in the basal ganglia network is thought to cause the hyperkinesia. There is no known cure for Huntington’s Disease, yet there is treatment available to minimize the hyperkinetic movements. Dopamine blockers, such as haloperidol, tetrabenazine, and amantadine, are often effective in this regard.|$|E
25|$|Asphyxia {{directly}} causes {{basal ganglia}} damage {{due to lack}} of oxygen and therefore, insufficient nutrient supply. The lesions caused by asphyxia are most prominent on the caudate nucleus and the <b>putamen.</b> However, a less-studied consequence of the resulting hypoxia is its effect on the concentrations of the neurotransmitter dopamine within the synapses of neurons in the basal ganglia. Hypoxia leads to an increase in the extracellular dopamine levels and therefore, an increase in the activity of the dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, this increase in extracellular concentration is not caused by an increase in the neurotransmitter synthesis, but instead on inhibiting its reuptake back into the neurons and glial cells. Therefore, there is an increased dopaminergic effect as dopamine remains in the synapse at higher concentrations leading to additional post-synaptic response. As a result, the uncontrollable writhing motions witnessed with athetosis deal with the over-activity of synapses within the basal ganglia.|$|E
25|$|The {{vascular}} arterial system supplying {{fresh blood}} branches into {{smaller and smaller}} vessels as it enters the brain surface and within-brain regions, culminating in a connected capillary bed within the brain. The drainage system, similarly, merges into larger and larger veins as it carries away oxygen-depleted blood. The dHb contribution to the fMRI signal is from both the capillaries near the area of activity and larger draining veins that may be farther away. For good spatial resolution, the signal from the large veins needs to be suppressed, since it does not correspond to {{the area where the}} neural activity is. This can be achieved either by using strong static magnetic fields or by using spin-echo pulse sequences. With these, fMRI can examine a spatial range from millimeters to centimeters, and can hence identify Brodmann areas (centimers), subcortical nuclei such as the caudate, <b>putamen</b> and thalamus, and hippocampal subfields such as the combined dentate gyrus/CA3, CA1, and subiculum.|$|E
25|$|Parkinson's {{disease is}} a common {{neurological}} disorder characterized by a degeneration of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra {{and a loss of}} dopamine in the <b>putamen.</b> It is described as a motor disease, but it also produces cognitive and behavioral symptoms. The most common treatment is dopamine replacement therapy, which consists in the administration of levodopa (L-Dopa) or dopamine agonists (such as pramipexole or ropinirole) to patients. Dopamine replacement therapy is well known to improve motor symptoms but its effects in cognitive and behavioral symptoms are more complex. Dopamine has been related to the normal learning of stimuli with behavioral and motivational significance, attention, and most importantly the reward system. In accordance with the role of dopamine in reward processing, addictive drugs stimulate dopamine release. Although the exact mechanism has yet to be elucidated, the role of dopamine in the reward system and addiction has been proposed as the origin of DDS. Models of addiction have been used to explain how dopamine replacement therapy produces DDS. One of these models of addiction proposes that over the usage course of a drug there is a habituation to the rewarding that it produces at the initial stages. This habituation is thought to be dopamine mediated. With long-term administration of L-dopa the reward system gets used to it and needs higher quantities. As the user increases drug intake there is a loss of dopaminergic receptors in the striatum which acts in addition to an impairment in goal-direction mental functions to produce an enhancement of sensitization to dopamine therapy. The behavioral and mood symptoms of the syndrome are produced by the dopamine overdose.|$|E
2500|$|The {{acceptance}} {{that the}} basal ganglia system constitutes one major cerebral system {{took time to}} arise. [...] The first anatomical identification of distinct subcortical structures was published by Thomas Willis in 1664. For many years, the term corpus striatum was used to describe {{a large group of}} subcortical elements, some of which were later discovered to be functionally unrelated. [...] For many years, the <b>putamen</b> and the caudate nucleus were not associated with each other. Instead, the <b>putamen</b> was associated with the pallidum in what was called the nucleus lenticularis or nucleus lentiformis.|$|E
2500|$|Decreasing {{levels of}} {{different}} serotonin receptors and the serotonin transporter, 5-HTT, {{have also been}} shown to occur with age. Studies conducted using PET methods on humans, in vivo, show that levels of the 5-HT2 receptor in the caudate nucleus, <b>putamen,</b> and frontal cerebral cortex, decline with age. [...] A decreased binding capacity of the 5-HT2 receptor in the frontal cortex was also found, as well as a decreased binding capacity of the serotonin transporter, 5-HHT, in the thalamus and the midbrain. [...] Postmortem studies on humans have indicated decreased binding capacities of serotonin and a {{decrease in the number of}} S1 receptors in the frontal cortex and hippocampus as well as a decrease in affinity in the <b>putamen.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The motor loop {{involving}} projections {{from the}} supplementary motor area, arcuate premotor area, motor cortex and somatosensory cortex into the <b>putamen,</b> which projects into the ventrolateral GPi and caudolateral SNr which projects into the cortex through the ventralis lateralis pars medialis and ventralis lateralis pars orialis.|$|E
2500|$|Both MRI and CT {{scanning}} frequently show {{a decrease}} {{in the size of the}} cerebellum and pons in those with cerebellar features. The <b>putamen</b> is hypodense on T2-weighted MRI and may show an increased deposition of iron in Parkinsonian form. In cerebellar form, a [...] "hot cross" [...] sign has been emphasized; it reflects atrophy of the pontocereballar fibers that manifest in T2 signal intensity in atrophic pons.|$|E
2500|$|A {{thorough}} reconsideration by Cécile and Oskar Vogt (1941) simplified {{the description}} of the basal ganglia by proposing the term striatum to describe the group of structures consisting of the caudate nucleus, the <b>putamen,</b> and the mass linking them ventrally, the nucleus accumbens. [...] The striatum was named {{on the basis of the}} striated (striped) appearance created by radiating dense bundles of striato-pallido-nigral axons, described by anatomist Samuel Alexander Kinnier Wilson (1912) as [...] "pencil-like".|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the gene}} therapy based {{approach}} involves gene delivery of neurturin and gilial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) to the <b>putamen</b> in patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease. GDNF protects dopamine neurons in vitro and animal models of parkinsonism; neurturin is a structural and functional analogue of GDNF that protected dopamine neuron in animal model of the disease. Despite [...] open-label trials showing benefits of continuous infusion of GDNF, the results were not confirmed in double-blind studies. This {{may be due to}} the distribution factor; the trophic factor was not distributed sufficiently throughout the target place.|$|E
2500|$|An {{overwhelming}} {{number of}} studies have reported age-related changes in dopamine synthesis, binding sites, and number of receptors. [...] Studies using positron emission tomography (PET) in living human subjects have shown a significant age-related decline in dopamine synthesis, notably in the striatum and extrastriatal regions (excluding the midbrain).C]DOPA |journal=Life Sciences |volume=79 |issue=8 |pages=730–736 |doi=10.1016/j.lfs.2006.02.017 |pmid=16580023 }} [...] Significant age-related decreases in dopamine receptors D1, D2, and D3 have also been highly reported. [...] A general decrease in D1 and D2 receptors has been shown, and more specifically a decrease of D1 and D2 receptor binding in the caudate nucleus and <b>putamen.</b> [...] A general decrease in D1 receptor density has also been shown to occur with age. [...] Significant age-related declines in dopamine receptors, D2 and D3 were detected in the anterior cingulate cortex, frontal cortex, lateral temporal cortex, hippocampus, medial temporal cortex, amygdala, medial thalamus, and lateral thalamus One study also indicated a significant inverse correlation between dopamine binding in the occipital cortex and age. [...] Postmortem studies also show that the number of D1 and D2 receptors decline with age in both the caudate nucleus and the <b>putamen,</b> although the ratio of these receptors did not show age-related changes. The loss of dopamine with age is thought to be responsible for many neurological symptoms that increase in frequency with age, such as decreased arm swing and increased rigidity. Changes in dopamine levels may also cause age-related changes in cognitive flexibility.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{components}} of the basal ganglia– as defined functionally– are the striatum; both dorsal striatum (caudate nucleus and <b>putamen)</b> and [...] ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle), globus pallidus, ventral pallidum, substantia nigra, and subthalamic nucleus. Each of these components has a complex internal anatomical and neurochemical organization. The largest component, the striatum (dorsal and ventral), receives input from many brain areas beyond the basal ganglia, but only sends output to other {{components of the}} basal ganglia. The pallidum receives input from the striatum, and sends inhibitory output {{to a number of}} motor-related areas. The substantia nigra {{is the source of the}} striatal input of the neurotransmitter dopamine, which plays an important role in basal ganglia function. The subthalamic nucleus receives input mainly from the striatum and cerebral cortex, and projects to the globus pallidus.|$|E
2500|$|The {{striatum}} {{is composed}} mostly of medium spiny neurons. [...] These GABAergic projection neurons project {{to the external}} (lateral) globus pallidus and internal (medial) globus pallidus {{as well as the}} substantia nigra pars reticulata. [...] The projections into the globus pallidus and substantia nigra are primarily dopaminergic, although enkephalin, dynorphin and substance P are expressed. [...] The striatum also contains interneurons that are classified into nitrergic neurons (due to use of nitric oxide as a neurotransmitter), tonically active [...] cholinergic interneurons, parvalbumin-expressing neurons and calretinin-expressing neurons. [...] The dorsal striatum receives significant glutamatergic inputs from the cortex, as well as dopaminergic inputs from the substantia nigra pars compacta. [...] The dorsal striatum is generally considered to be involved in sensorimotor activities. [...] The ventral striatum receives glutamatergic inputs from the limbic areas as well as dopaminergic inputs from the VTA, via the mesolimbic pathway. The ventral striatum is believed {{to play a role in}} reward and other limbic functions. [...] The dorsal striatum is divided into the caudate and <b>putamen</b> by the internal capsule while the ventral striatum is composed of the nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle. The caudate has three primary regions of connectivity, with the head of the caudate demonstrating connectivity to the prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex and amygdala. [...] The body and tail show differentiation between the dorsolateral rim and ventral caudate, projecting to the sensorimotor and limbic regions of the striatum respectively.|$|E
2500|$|Researchers used rats {{in order}} to {{investigate}} the effects of novel tactile objects on the long-term evolution of the major rodent forebrain loops essential in species-specific behaviours, including such structures as the hippocampus, <b>putamen,</b> neocortex [...] and the thalamus. [...] The rats were monitored but not bothered for 48–96 hours, allowing normal wake-sleep cycles to occur. [...] At some point four novel tactile objects {{were placed in the}} four corners of the rat's cage. [...] They were all very different from one another and they were there for a total of one hour. [...] The brain activity during this hour was used as a baseline or template to compare. [...] Data analysis implied that the neural assemblies during SWS correlated significantly more with templates than during waking hours or REM sleep. As well, these post-learning, post-SWS reverberations lasted 48 hours, much longer than the duration of novel object learning (one hour), indicating long term potentiation. [...] Further analysis on a neuron to neuron base showed no subset of neurons (brain structure) to be responsible for the reverberations or anti-reverberations (patterns of activity significantly more dissimilar than novel stimulation templates). [...] Another difference noticed was the highest correlation peaks in SWS corresponded with the lowest rate of neuron firing in the forebrain, opposite that of REM sleep and waking where rate of firing is the highest. [...] It is hypothesized that this is due to interference from other incoming stimuli during waking periods. [...] In SWS there is no incoming stimuli so the novel experience can be replayed, without interruption.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>putamen</b> (...) is a round {{structure}} {{located at}} the base of the forebrain (telencephalon). The <b>putamen</b> and caudate nucleus together form the dorsal striatum. It is also one of the structures that comprises the basal ganglia. Through various pathways, the <b>putamen</b> is connected to the substantia nigra and globus pallidus. The main function of the <b>putamen</b> is to regulate movements and influence various types of learning. It employs GABA, acetylcholine, and enkephalin to perform its functions. The <b>putamen</b> also plays a role in degenerative neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease.|$|E
50|$|The <b>putamen</b> {{in humans}} {{is similar in}} {{structure}} and function to other animals. Therefore, many studies on the <b>putamen</b> have been done on animals (monkeys, rats, etc.), as well as humans.|$|E
50|$|After {{discovering}} {{the function of}} the <b>putamen,</b> it has become apparent to neurologists that the <b>putamen</b> and basal ganglia {{play an important role in}} Parkinson's disease and other diseases that involve the degeneration of neurons.|$|E
50|$|The DRD1 gene expresses {{primarily}} in the caudate <b>putamen</b> in humans, and in the caudate <b>putamen,</b> the nucleus accumbens and the olfactory tubercle in mouse. Gene expression patterns from the Allen Brain Atlases in mouse and human can be found here.|$|E
50|$|The <b>putamen</b> is a {{structure}} in the forebrain. Along with the caudate nucleus it forms the dorsal striatum. The caudate and <b>putamen</b> contain {{the same types of}} neurons and circuits - many neuroanatomists consider the dorsal striatum to be a single structure, divided into two parts by a large fiber tract, the internal capsule, passing through the middle. The <b>putamen,</b> together with the globus pallidus, makes up the lenticular nucleus. The <b>putamen</b> is the outermost portion of the basal ganglia. These are a group of nuclei in the brain that are interconnected with the cerebral cortex, thalamus, and brainstem. Basal ganglia include the dorsal striatum, substantia nigra, nucleus accumbens, and the subthalamic nucleus.|$|E
50|$|The <b>putamen</b> {{was found}} to have {{significantly}} larger amounts of grey matter in male to female transgender individuals compared to the <b>putamen</b> of a typical cisgender male. This possibly suggests that a fundamental difference in brain composition may exist between trans women and cis men.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} control movement, the <b>putamen</b> must {{interact}} with the other structures {{that make up the}} basal ganglia. These include the caudate nucleus and globus pallidus. These two structures, along with the <b>putamen,</b> interact through a series of direct and indirect inhibitory pathways. The direct pathway consists of two inhibitory pathways from the <b>putamen</b> to the substantia nigra and the internal region of the globus pallidus. This pathway uses the neurotransmitters dopamine, GABA and substance P. The indirect pathway consists of three inhibitory pathways that go from the <b>putamen</b> and caudate nucleus to the external region of the globus pallidus. This pathway uses dopamine, GABA and enkephalin. When there is interplay between the direct and indirect pathways, involuntary movements occur.|$|E
50|$|The dorsal {{striatum}} {{is located}} in the subcortical region of the forebrain. It is divided by a white matter tract called the internal capsule into two parts: the <b>putamen</b> and the caudate nucleus. The <b>putamen</b> and caudate both input information from the cerebral cortex, thalamus, and substantia nigra.|$|E
50|$|The lateral {{and largest}} part is of a reddish color, {{and is known}} as the <b>putamen,</b> while the medial and {{intermediate}} are of a yellowish tint, and together constitute the globus pallidus; all three are marked by fine radiating white fibers, which are most distinct in the <b>putamen.</b>|$|E
