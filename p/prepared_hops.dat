40|$|Hops are a main {{ingredient}} used in brewing {{to create and}} enhance different styles of beer and {{are the source of}} hop bitterness acids which include alpha and beta acids. It has been hypothesized that hops reduce microbial growth in beer and contribute to stability of the product. There have been few studies investigating variation of antimicrobial activity in different hop varieties and their effectiveness at reducing growth of different bacterial contaminants. Therefore, we investigated antimicrobial activity of six varieties of hops, with different alpha acid ratings, on growth inhibition of three bacterial species. Discs were soaked in <b>prepared</b> <b>hop</b> extracts and placed on a lawn of bacterial growth in a petri dish. The diameter of growth inhibition was measured after 24 hours. The results indicated significant differences in inhibition among the varieties (ANOVA p 3 ̆c 0. 0001) and in among bacterial species (ANOVA p 3 ̆c 0. 0001). There was a trend for higher alpha acid hops decreasing microbial growth...|$|R

40|$|A {{detailed}} study of a-acids isomerization kinetics was undertaken by performing pilot-scale brewing experiments with T 90 hop pellets, nonisomerized hop extract, and nonisomerized hop extract plus hop residue. In addition, a brew was prepared by adding preisomerized hop extract {{at the onset of}} wort boiling. Compared with the use of nonisomerized hop extract, significantly higher isomerization yields were obtained when vegetative material was included in the hopping. However, when vegetative material was present final alpha-acids utilization was compromised by large losses of iso-alpha-acids postboiling. Evidence of reverse isomerization of iso-alpha-acids during wort boiling was not found when preisomerized hop extract was applied. The results obtained using quantitative HPLC profiling confirmed that both alpha-acids and iso-alpha-acids were not stable upon beer aging. In particular, trans-iso-alpha-acids underwent rapid degradation in finished beer. Therefore, beers <b>prepared</b> with preisomerized <b>hop</b> extract containing relatively less-sensitive traps-isomers, and thus more cis-isomers, show improved bitterness stability upon aging compared with conventionally hopped beers. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The meiosis-specific HOP 1 gene is {{important}} both for crossing over between homologs and for production of viable spores, hop 1 diploids fail to assemble synaptonemal complex (SC), which normally provides {{the framework for}} meiotic synapsis, Immunochemical methods {{have shown that the}} 70 -kDa HOP 1 product is a component of the SC. To assess its molecular function,,ve have purified Hop 1 protein to homogeneity and shown that it forms dimers and higher oligomers in solution, Consistent with the zinc-finger motif in its sequence, the purified protein contained about 1 mol equivalent of zinc whereas mutant protein lacking a conserved cysteine within this motif did not, Electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays with different forms of M 13 DNA showed that Hop 1 binds more readily to linear duplex DNA and negatively superhelical DNA than to nicked circular duplex DNA and even more weakly to single-stranded DNA, Linear duplex DNA binding was enhanced by the addition of Zn 2 + was stronger for longer DNA fragments, and was saturable to about 55 bp/protein monomer. Competitive inhibition of this binding by added oligonucleotides suggests preferential affinity for G-rich sequences and weaker binding to poly(dA-dT). Nuclear extracts of meiotic cells caused exonucleolytic degradation of linear duplex DNA if the extracts were <b>prepared</b> from <b>hop</b> 1 mutants; addition of purified Hop 1 conferred protection against this degradation. These findings suggest that Hop 1 acts in meiotic synapsis by binding to sites of double-strand break formation and helping to mediate their processing in the pathway-to meiotic recombination...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from June 6, 2016 - June 6, 2017 When hops are added to beer, varying degrees of hoppy aroma persist in the finished beer {{as a result of}} a number of factors. Dry-hopping is a technique whereby hops are added to beer post-fermentation to leverage the maximum aroma potential of the hop essential oils while minimizing bitterness contribution from the hop alpha acids. Brewers are very interested in understanding dry-hopping as this practice is widely used throughout the industry. The studies herein investigate both the dry-hop process as a vehicle to dose flavor and aroma into beer and hop/processing factors that contribute to this operation. Hop oil serves as the primary reservoir of aromatic compounds in the hop plant and it is hypothesized that using hops with greater total oil content will result in more hoppy aroma in dry-hopped beers. An unhopped beer was dry-hopped with 23 individual Cascade hop lots and was evaluated using sensory descriptive analysis. There was no correlation between total oil content (ml oil/ 100 g hops) and overall hop aroma intensity (OHAI). Therefore, the specific volume of hop oil in hops is an inadequate indicator of hoppiness potential in dry-hopped beer. Cascade, Chinook, and Centennial hops are some of the most popular American hops used by brewers across the globe. Because of their high use, there exists a need to understand how the hop-derived, analytical profile of these cultivars in the beer system can be used to enhance quality assurance strategies. An in-depth flavor analysis approach utilizing Solvent-Assisted Flavor Evaporation (SAFE) and Aroma Extract Dilution Analysis (AEDA) was carried out to understand which compounds contribute the most to the character of these hops in the dry-hopped system. The analysis revealed Cascade, Chinook, and Centennial had 9, 10, and 11 character impact compounds (CIC). Commonalities were observed among the three cultivars regarding 2 -furanmethanol, linalool, geraniol, cis-geranic acid methyl ester, and n-decanoic acid in beer. Variation between the Centennial and Chinook cultivars is a function of only a few character impact compounds whereas Cascade is markedly different, anchored heavily by benzenacetaldeyde. This knowledge could help introduce potential replacements, removals, and/or reductions for these hop cultivars in the future. When stored under pro-oxidative conditions, qualitative changes in the chemical and aroma profile of Hallertauer Mittelfrüh (HHA) hops occurs. It was hypothesized that lager beer dry-hopped with oxidized HHA would impact both the qualitative attributes related hop aroma in the finished beer and influence consumer acceptance. Lager beer was dry-hopped using oxidized hops and a non-oxidized control at two different hopping rates (3. 8 g/L, 1. 5 g/L). Trained panelists using descriptive analysis evaluated the beer dry-hopped at 3. 8 g/L. At this dosing rate, significant qualitative changes were observed in the beer as a result of using oxidized hops. The beers dry-hopped with the oxidized hops had significantly higher sensory ratings for woody and herbal attributes, which are associated with “noble” hop aroma. 60 consumers rated their acceptance of the beers dry-hopped at a lower rate of 1. 5 g/L and no significant difference in overall liking was found between the hop preparations. While changes in hop chemistry occur as a result of oxidation, these changes may not adversely affect overall liking of beer <b>prepared</b> with oxidized <b>hops</b> but may serve as a way to enhance "noble" hop aroma in lager beer. Dry-hopping can be used as a method to assess the aroma potential of a hop cultivar, for instance as a tool used during the late stages of the hop breeding process or as a way to determine beer performance of a prospective hop cultivar when evaluating hops pre-purchase. These evaluations, though quick, are commonly prone to high variation. From a hop perspective, more effective sampling and preparation techniques were implemented to reduce within lot variation and increase homogeneity. From a processing perspective, increased volumes of liquid, duplicate dry-hopping events, blending and filtration methodology, as well as oxygen control have reduced the process derived variation. The Oregon State dry-hopping method has evolved to best display hop material in dry-hopped beer in an accurate and precise manner as well as reveal the variable nature of small-scale hop evaluations...|$|R
