5|$|Although {{capable of}} {{generating}} a high volume of fire, autocannon {{are limited by}} the amount of ammunition that can be carried by the weapons systems mounting them. For this reason, both the 25mm Bushmaster and the 30mm RARDEN are deliberately designed with relatively slow rates of fire, to extend the amount of time they can be employed on a battlefield before requiring a resupply of ammunition. The rate of fire of modern autocannon ranges from 90 rounds <b>per</b> <b>minute,</b> to 1,800 rounds <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b> Systems with multiple barrels—Gatling guns—can have rates of fire of several thousand rounds per minute; the fastest of these is the GSh-6-30K, which has a rate of fire of over 6,000rounds <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b>|$|E
