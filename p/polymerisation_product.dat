40|$|PosterInternational audienceMetal oxide {{films are}} widely used {{in a variety of}} products. Their {{properties}} make them interesting for a growing field of applications. Especially alumina is of high interest due to its hardness, chemical resistance, low conductivity and capacity as diffusion barrier. Therefore, Al 2 O 3 is applied e. g. in solar cells, as erosion and corrosion resistant coating on cutting tools, for encapsulation of phosphor particles or for the production of OLEDs. Providing a homogenous high quality coating, CVD and especially plasma enhanced CVD processes (PECVD) are the favoured processes to deposit alumina on complex geometries. A suitable technique is the use of aluminum tri-isopropoxide (ATI) in process plasmas. Nevertheless, the processes taking place in that complex plasma are not well understood, yet. In this work aluminum tri-isopropoxide containing plasmas were investigated by using mass spectrometry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The obtained results allow describing possible reaction paths referring to the fragmentation of monomeric ATI, finally leading to the formation of AlOx. Moreover, the absolute concentration and the degree of dissociation of the ATI molecules as well as the fragmentation efficiency and fragmentation rate have been calculated. Furthermore, <b>polymerisation</b> <b>products</b> were observed and quantitative information could partially be obtained, providing important information about the plasma chemistry...|$|R

Low-temperature carbonised pine {{resulted in a}} visually homogeneously treated product with a substantial (about 70 % w/w) reduced non-cellulosic carbohydrates content, as compared with untreated pine. These components have been removed or have been partly converted into hydrophobic <b>polymerisation</b> <b>products,</b> which results in reduced water absorption in air of different relative humidity (RH) for carbonised pine. The flexural strength at high RH and after immersion in water of carbonised wood is comparable with untreated and creosote impregnated wood. However, at lower RH the carbonised wood is less strong. Only trace amounts of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and other phenolic compounds could be detected both in water leached from carbonised wood and untreated wood. Furans, mainly 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural, have been demonstrated to leach in substantial amounts in the water from carbonised pine. An accelerated decay test in soil showed that low-temperature carbonisation of pine resulted in a product with considerably enhanced durability, as compared with untreated wood.

The degradation products were identified using spectroscopic methods and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). 2 -Methoxyphenol, 4 -hydroxybenzaldehyde, vanillin, and vanillic acid were produced. Their <b>polymerisation</b> <b>products</b> {{were used as}} synthetic tanning agents for tanning collagen. Polymerised 2 -methoxyphenol can increase the hydrothermal stability of collagen, like a conventional syntan, through hydrogen bonding interactions between the polymers and the protein. These products have potential {{to be used as}} raw materials for tanning of animal skins and other industries, such as chemical, pharmaceutical, food, and perfumery industries. Therefore, this can add value to the industrial byproduct (Kraft lignin), often considered a waste, and reduce its environmental impact. Leather tanning reactions between collagen and dihydroxynaphthalenes (DHNs) and oxazolidine have also been investigated, using hide powder and sheepskin pickled pelt. This investigation showed that some DHNs have a tanning effect on collagen. The measurement of combined and cross-linked DHNs on collagen showed that 30 – 40 % of 1, 6 - and 2, 6 -DHNs were fixed through covalent bonding. Shrinkage temperature of the leather changed little after the non combined DHNs had been removed from the leather, indicating that the high stability of the combination tanned leather comes from the covalent bonding formed between DHNs and collagen through oxazolidine.

40|$|Photoinitiators play a {{key role}} in UV-curable systems by {{generating}} the reactive species, free radicals, ions or molecule which initiate the polymerisation of the multifunctional monomers and oligomers. This research involves the study of the hydrolytic and photolytic stabilities of two important new photoinitiator bis (2, 4, 6 -trimethylbenzoyl) phenylphosphine oxide (BAPO) and (2, 4, 6 -trimethylbenzoyl) diphenyl-phosphine oxide (TPO). BAPO is a new member in the group of well-known α-cleavable photoinitiators among which monoacylphosphine oxide (MAPO) is most recognised. These α–cleavable photoinitiators are characterised by low volatility and high solubility in acrylate monomers and they are very widely applied as curing agents for white and pigmented coatings including furniture coatings. Novel analytical methods were developed in order to characterise these compounds and to understand their modes of action and breakdown. The stability of BAPO in different solvents, such as acetonitrile and a cyanoacrylate ester, was studied and the effect of storage of BAPO in light and dark conditions was evaluated. The effects of stabilisers (ferrocene, cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) and hydroquinone (HQ)), acids (methyl sulphonic acid (MSA) and boron trifluoride dihydrate (BF 3 ∙ 2 H 2 O)) and water present in the solvent were also investigated. These studies were monitored over time using LC-UV and CE-UV methods. Mass spectrometry was employed for the first time to investigate the pathways and photodegradation products for both of the photoinitiators BAPO and TPO. NMR spectroscopy and computational studies were used as complementary experimental and theoretical techniques respectively for the elucidation of the photochemistry of these products.

Kraft lignin degradation by a biomimetic system was investigated, using haemin and hydrogen peroxide, which mimics the catalytic mechanism of lignin peroxidase to produce phenolic compounds. The degradation products were identified using spectroscopic methods and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. 2 -methoxyphenol, 4 -hydroxybenzaldehyde, vanillin and vanillic acid were produced and their formaldehyde <b>polymerisation</b> <b>products</b> were used for tanning collagen. The denaturation (shrinkage) temperature of collagen was raised to 80 °C through hydrogen bonding interactions between the polymers and the protein. For dyeing of hide powder, the lignin degradation products were reacted with laccase (a polyphenol oxidase); 2 -methoxyphenol gave the darkest colour. These products have potential to be used as raw materials for tanning and dyeing of animal skins. Therefore, this can add value to the industrial byproduct (Kraft lignin) and reduce its environmental impact. Polyphenols are the basic building blocks of natural skin and hair pigments: they can be polymerised to create versions of natural black, brown and orange melanins. These reactions can be catalysed by laccase; not only do they create colour, but also if they are conducted in the presence of collagen, the resulting pigment is bound to the leather in a covalent tanning manner. Therefore, the leather becomes coloured by a lightfast pigment, which is firmly fixed. It appears to be a feature of this type of stabilising mechanism for collagen, the creation of a polyphenol matrix around the triple helix, that it has the added benefit of actually strengthening the leather. Since every traditional process step effectively weakens collagen, especially tanning, this is the first chemical reaction that has been shown to reverse that effect.

40|$|Chapter 1 {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} polyethylene (PE) end-functionalisation as a route to block copolymers, reviews the different literature methods for their synthesis this way, and compares {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of each. Finally, an existing method which makes use of PE terminated with a styrene derivative is identified as having fewer disadvantages than most literature procedures. Further investigation of the mechanism is proposed. Chapter 2 focusses on the different types of so-called dormant state formed in Ziegler-Natta catalysed olefin polymerisations, and in particular on the dormancy occurring after styrene insertion. Copolymerisations of ethylene with styrene, allylbenzene and 4 -phenyl- 1 -butene in the presence of hydrogen are undertaken, and evidence for the presence of a dormant state or simply competitive rates of hydrogenation vs ethylene insertion is discussed. Increasing styrene concentration beyond that used by Chung is found to yield PE capped at both chain ends with styrene. A new mechanism – Catalytic Hydride Initiated Polymerisation (CHIP) – is consistent with these new observations. Chapter 3 focusses on extending the application of the CHIP mechanism to the synthesis of new examples of end-functional PE. Copolymerisations of ethylene with α-methylstyrene and related monomers 1, 3 / 1, 4 -diisopropenylbenzene, α-methylstyrene dimer and limonene in the presence of hydrogen are investigated, resulting in the successful synthesis of a range of PE examples initiated with each comonomer. The effects of hydrogen pressure and comonomer concentration are also discussed. The advantages of CHIP are discussed, and the synthesis of end-functionalised PE incorporating DIB is studied in detail. An α-methylstyrene like end group is present at the start of the PE chains.

They may be naturally present in food, mostly in fruits, vegetables or grains, or produced by biosynthesis from natural sugars or polysaccharides and added to food products because of their nutritional properties or organoleptic characteristics. The dietary intake of oligosaccharides is difficult to estimate, but it may reach 3 - 13 g/d per person (for fructo-oligosaccharides), depending on the population. The extent of resistance to enzymic reactions occurring in {{the upper part of}} the gastrointestinal tract allows oligosaccharides to become 'colonic nutrients', as some intestinal bacterial species express specific hydrolases and are able to convert oligosaccharides into short-chain fatty acids (acetate, lactate, propionate, butyrate) and/or gases by fermentation. Oligosaccharides that selectively promote some interesting bacterial species (e. g. lactobacilli, bifidobacteria), and thus equilibrate intestinal microflora, are now termed prebiotics. The pattern of short-chain fatty acid production in the caeco-colon, as well as the prebiotic effect, if demonstrated, are dynamic processes that vary with the type of oligosaccharide (e. g. extent of polymerisation, nature of hexose moieties), the duration of the treatment, the initial composition of flora or the diet in which they are incorporated. Experimental data obtained in vitro and in vivo in animals, and also recent data obtained in human subjects, support the involvement of dietary oligosaccharides in physiological processes in the different intestinal cell types (e. g. mucins production, cell division, immune cells function, ionic transport) and also outside the gastrointestinal tract (e. g. hormone production, lipid and carbohydrates metabolism).

The counter anions used were [Cl]¯, [HSO 4]¯, [H 2 PO 4]¯, [BF 4]¯, [PF 6]¯, [TFSI]¯ and [TFA]¯. The ILs physico- and electro-chemical properties were evaluated {{in order to}} draw structure-property relationships between them.

However, the [TFSI]¯ and [TFA]¯ based ILs displayed some very low viscosities with the lowest of 58 cP reported for diallylhexylammonium [TFA]¯. The electrochemical windows of the less viscous t-DAAA ILs compared well with those reported in literature for protic ammonium and aprotic imidazolium ILs.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} the route that comprises the upgrading of pyrolysis oil (produced from lingo-cellulosic biomass) and its further co-processing in standard refineries to produce transportation fuels. In the present concept, pyrolysis oil is produced where biomass is available and then transported {{to a central}} upgrading unit. This unit is located next or inside a standard petroleum refinery, enabling the use of existing facilities. The obtained product can be further distributed using existing distribution networks. The present thesis describes and discusses pyrolysis oil upgrading by high pressure thermal treatment (HPTT) and hydrodeoxygenation (HDO), and its subsequent co-processing in lab-scale refinery units. The oil produced by HPTT had higher energy density than the feed due to its lower oxygen and water content. Conversion and transfer of water soluble organics to the oil phase was observed, increasing the energy recovery in the final product. However, severe and fast polymerisation was also observed. This <b>polymerisation</b> created a <b>product</b> with high coking tendency {{that could not be}} co-processed in lab-scale refinery units. HDO of pyrolysis oil (and fractions obtained by adding water to it) also created an oil with lower oxygen and water content. However, during HDO, polymerisation was avoided. HDO oils (with high remaining oxygen content) produced at different conditions and from various pyrolysis oil fractions, could be co-processed with Long Residue in a lab-scale catalytic cracking unit. The resulting yields to gasoline and light cycle oil (diesel precursor) were near the same as obtained using the pure fossil reference feed. The presence of such fossil co-feed enabled hydrogen transfer reactions from the fossil feed to the HDO oils components and appeared to be crucial to obtain a good product distribution. Co-processing HDO oils with straight run gas oil in a lab-scale hydrodesulphurisation unit was performed without operational problems, but competition between oxygen and sulphur removal reactions was detected. Dedicated HDO experiments showed that mass transfer resistances can limit the extent of the hydrotreating reactions (favouring in this way the extent of undesired polymerisation reactions, thus deteriorating product quality) and need careful consideration when designing demo units and industrial HDO reactors...|$|R

In the last 15 years the global annual production has doubled, reaching 245 million tons in 2008. Several of the chemicals used to produce plastics are hazardous for {{human health and the}} environment. These, and their degradation products, may be released during the life cycle of a plastic product. The plastic polymers are not considered as toxic, but in plastic products there may be non-bound residual monomers, <b>polymerisation</b> chemicals, degradation <b>products,</b> and additives which have toxic properties. The overall aim of this thesis, which is based on five papers [I-V], was to study the environmental and health hazards of chemicals in plastic polymers and products. Leaching tests, toxicity tests and Toxicity Identification Evaluations (TIEs) were made on plastic products [I, II], synthetic textiles [III], and discarded electronic products [IV]. A hazard ranking model was developed and used to rank plastic polymers based on monomer composition and environmental and health hazard classifications [V]. Also other hazardous substances needed to produce each polymer were identified [V]. Substances causing acute toxicity to Daphnia magna (water flee) leached from one third of all 83 plastic products/textiles even during short term (1 - 3 d) leaching in deionised water [I-III]. The toxic leachates came mainly from products that were soft to semi-soft, i. e. plasticised PVC (11 / 13) and polyurethane (3 / 4), and from epoxy products (5 / 5), and from synthetic textiles made of various plastic fibres [I-III]. The electronic product leachates that were acutely toxic came from mixed material and metal components, and not from plastics components. TIEs, performed on some leachates, indicated that the major toxicants were hydrophobic organics for the plastic product and synthetic textile leachates [I-III], and metals for the electronic product leachates [IV]. The polymers ranked as most hazardous are made of monomers classified as mutagenic and/or carcinogenic (category 1 A or 1 B). These belong to the polymer families of polyurethanes, polyacrylonitriles, PVC, epoxy resins, and styrenic copolymers (ABS, SAN and HIPS), and have a large global production (1 - 37 million tons/year). A considerable number of polymers, 31 out of 55, are made of monomers that belong to the two highest of the ranking model’s five hazard levels [V]. Examples of such polymers, with a large global production (1 - 5 million tons/year), are phenol formaldehyde resins, unsaturated polyesters, polycarbonate, polymethyl methacrylate, and ureaformaldehyde resins [V]. The ranking model was useful for identifying and comparing hazardous substances, and the results from the hazard identification can be used for further hazard and risk assessment for decisions on the need for risk reduction measures, substitution or phase out. In conclusion, considering the extensive dispersion in the society and the environment, the growing production, and the release and use of many hazardous chemicals, it is important to further assess the risks of chemicals associated with plastic polymers and products...|$|R
