5|$|The {{situation}} {{became quite}} tense {{with each of}} the sides making threats and refusing to meet with each other. Maga threatened that the north would secede if his victory was not validated, and Apithy threatened that his base of <b>Porto-Novo</b> would join with Nigeria. Ethnic tensions increased with these threats and with mass migration of people back to their traditional ethnic territories. Many inside the country considered Dahomey to be close to civil war.|$|E
5|$|Following {{independence}} in 1960, Dahomey had its first elections in December. As {{a result of}} Fon ethnic identification with Ahomadégbé and perceived corruption and ineffectiveness of the Apithy administration, Ahomadégbé made large gains in the <b>Porto-Novo</b> region traditionally aligned with Apithy. Apithy responded to this by making a parliamentary alliance with Maga which made Maga the first President of Dahomey and made Apithy the first Minister of Finance and then later the Vice President. To consolidate his power, Maga promoted a number of allies and people from the north through the new positions in the country's civil service. In addition, he tried to weaken his ally's political power by appointing Apithy to be the Ambassador of France {{while he was still}} the Vice President. Unfortunately giving political positions and channeling money to the north caused severe budgetary problems in the country which eventually led Maga to freeze wages for public employees leading to a general strike by unionists and students in October 1963. On 28 October, Christophe Soglo, the Army Chief of Staff, removed Maga from power and created a new system of government with Apithy being appointed the head of state and Ahomadégbé the head of government. However, the division between these roles and the responsibilities between the two leaders was not clearly defined. During the 1963 coup, Maga and many of his inner circle were arrested and tried for mismanagement of public funds.|$|E
25|$|After re-arming and regrouping, the Fon {{returned}} to raiding the Ouémé Valley, the same valley fought {{over in the}} first war with France. Victor Ballot, the French Resident at <b>Porto-Novo,</b> was sent via gunboat upriver to investigate. His ship was attacked and forced to depart with five men wounded in the incident. King Benhanzin rejected complaints by the French, and war was declared immediately by the French.|$|E
25|$|The French {{entrusted}} the {{war effort}} against Dahomey to Alfred-Amédée Dodds, an octoroon colonel of the Troupes de marine from Senegal. Colonel Dodds arrived with a force of 2,164 men including Foreign Legionnaires, marines, engineers, artillery and Senegalese cavalry known as spahis plus the trusted tirailleurs. These forces were armed with the new Lebel rifles, which would prove decisive in the coming battle. The French protectorate kingdom of <b>Porto-Novo</b> also added some 2,600 porters {{to aid in the}} fight.|$|E

The program's objective is to increase access to infrastructure and basic services in the Beninese cities of Cotonou, <b>Porto-Novo,</b> Parakou, Abomey-Calavi, Kandi and Lokossa.

500|$|The {{colony of}} French Dahomey was {{created as a}} part of French West Africa in 1904. [...] The colony was {{constructed}} of two coastal kingdoms with a long history of antagonism with one another (Dahomey and <b>Porto-Novo)</b> with a large area to the north controlled by a variety of mostly Mahi and Bariba peoples.|$|E
500|$|Following {{independence}} from France, the Republic of Dahomey saw {{a division of}} the country between different political/ethnic parties with one party representing {{the northern part of the}} country, one party representing the former Kingdom of Dahomey in the southwest, and one party representing <b>Porto-Novo</b> in the southeast. The result was a highly unstable system of governance with the leaders of each of these different parties struggling with each other for power. Hubert Maga from the north was deposed in a military coup in 1963 which eventually appointed Apithy from <b>Porto-Novo</b> and Ahomadégbé from the former kingdom of Dahomey as the divided rulers of the country. Ahomadégbé was eventually able to gain the support of Maga to gain the upper hand over Apithy and become the leader in the country only to be deposed two days later by the military. Five years of political instability, including multiple other military coups and a failed election eventually resulted in the 1970 Presidential election which largely divided the country and, when there was violence, the military annulled the results. In the political crisis that resulted, the military was able to get the three main candidates, Maga, Ahomadégbé, and Apithy to agree to form a Presidential Council with all three holding all executive and legislative authority.|$|E
500|$|After World War II, {{the colonies}} of French West Africa began a 15 year process towards independence. French Dahomey, {{like many other}} colonies, saw {{domestic}} political parties emerge in the mid-1950s. However, in contrast {{to many of the}} other colonies, political parties in French Dahomey did not become predominant through the whole colony, but largely adhered to the precolonial regions. In {{the northern part of the}} country, the Groupement Ethnique du Nord and then the Rassemblement Démocratique du Dahomé led by Hubert Maga were the most dominant party. In the area that was formerly the kingdom of Dahomey, the Union Démocratique du Dahomé led by Justin Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin became the most powerful party. And in <b>Porto-Novo,</b> the Parti des Nationialistes Dahoméens led by Sourou-Migan Apithy was the major party. Although there were some efforts by the various parties to become predominant throughout the colony, the division of the colony into three distinct spheres for the different parties had largely solidified by 1957. Apithy was the major political leader in the colony, being elected twice to the French National Assembly in 1946 and 1951. Maga was also elected in 1951 as the colony's second representative to the National Assembly.|$|E
