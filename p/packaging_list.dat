30|$|When a query for {{the state}} of one or more virtual {{machines}} is issued, the Update Checker first checks to see if the result of that query is already available in the Result Cache and returns the cached result if it is not obsolete. Cached results are considered obsolete after a configurable amount of time, depending on factors such as the frequency of updates or the need for security. Otherwise, it checks if the <b>package</b> <b>lists</b> of all repositories assigned to the virtual machine are available in the Repository Cache and not obsolete, i.e., the configured validity period has not yet expired. If this is not the case, the <b>package</b> <b>lists</b> are downloaded from the software vendor’s repository, parsed and stored in the Repository Cache for future use. When using the Repository Cache instead of the real repositories, there is the chance that the Update Checker fails to identify an outdated package. Nevertheless, the Repository Cache is very useful for checking many virtual machines and by using a small validity period, the risk can be minimized. Finally, the actual check of the virtual machine is started, comparing the version of each installed package with the version available at the repository. Information about outdated packages is then stored in the Result Cache, so that subsequent queries regarding the same virtual machine can be answered faster.|$|R
