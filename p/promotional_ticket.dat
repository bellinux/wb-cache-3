50|$|The team's debut {{season in}} Vodacom League was very successful, as they managed both {{to win the}} North-West province, and get {{promoted}} after the provincial play-offs, to play the next two seasons in the National First Division. By June 2007, they were however relegated back again to the North-West province of Vodacom League. They managed again to win the province, both in 2010 and 2011, but today still play in Vodacom League, as they were not yet able to also win the <b>promotional</b> <b>tickets</b> at the provincial play-offs.|$|R
25|$|In 1995, the Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund was {{the first}} local public {{transport}} network outside Deutsche Bahn to join the Bahncard system. A 40% discount on all local train, tram and bus tickets was offered to Bahncard holders, and included in <b>promotional</b> <b>tickets</b> such as the Guten-Abend-Ticket. Long distance DB tickets with Frankfurt as a destination also allowed a single free connecting journey for non-Bahncard customers. In exchange, Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund customers {{were able to use}} Deutsche Bahn Interregio (regional) trains for free. Commuters who held season tickets of the Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund could now also use Intercity, Eurocity, and InterCityExpress trains in the Rhein-Main area for a small surcharge.|$|R

50|$|In late 2007, Garth Brooks was {{slated to}} release The Ultimate Hits, a {{compilation}} and Brooks' first album featuring new music since 2001. The album release coincided with Sprint Center's opening, prompting Brooks' agreement to one <b>promotional</b> concert; however, <b>ticket</b> demand was extremely high, {{resulting in an}} additional eight concerts added. All concerts, consisting of nearly 160,000 tickets, sold out {{in less than two}} hours.|$|R
50|$|On {{the day of}} the new network launch, {{a convoy}} of 20 of the new buses was {{organised}} for the press, crossing the Strood tunnel twice, then running into the depot. The class leader of the new buses, 6401 (GN04 UDM), was specially decorated in a promotional livery for the network launch and headed the convoy. This bus was later repainted into a special network <b>ticket</b> <b>promotional</b> livery.|$|R
500|$|... "Ocean" [...] was {{the first}} of two promotional singles to be {{released}} from Silver Eye, with the other being [...] "Moon in Your Mouth" [...] which was released two weeks later; the song was distributed to digital retailers on 10 March 2017 through Mute Records following its initial debut on Billboards official website. It was written and produced by members Alison Goldfrapp and William Owen Gregory with The Haxan Cloak and John Congleton serving as additional producers. While creating material for Silver Eye, the duo had trouble writing songs that they actually enjoyed; Goldfrapp claimed that [...] "it always takes about three months to write all the rubbish out of your system before you get something you like". Along with the announcement of [...] "Ocean" [...] as a <b>promotional</b> single, <b>tickets</b> for a <b>promotional</b> tour for Silver Eye were made available for purchase, with show legs in Europe and the United States.|$|R
5000|$|While Page's new roster still {{played a}} few {{songs from the}} Yardbirds' canon—usually [...] "Train Kept a-Rollin'," [...] "Dazed and Confused" [...] or [...] "For Your Love" [...] and snatches of Beck's [...] "Shapes of Things" [...] solo —a name (and identity) change was in order in Oct. 1968. They {{appeared}} on contracts, <b>promotional</b> material, <b>ticket</b> stubs and other collateral as [...] "The Yardbirds" [...] or [...] "The New Yardbirds" [...] for three shows in October 1968, with the Marquee Club date reported as the Yardbirds' [...] "farewell London appearance" [...] and the Liverpool University show 19 Oct. announced as the Yardbirds' [...] "last ever appearance". This may have been motivated, at least in part, by a cease-and-desist order from Dreja, who claimed that he maintained legal rights to [...] "The Yardbirds" [...] name, though most sources indicate that Page and Grant fully intended to change the name after they returned from Scandanavia {{with or without the}} nudge from Dreja. From 19 Oct. 1968 on, they were Led Zeppelin, the name taken from The Who bandmembers Moon and Entwistle's [...] "lead balloon" [...] discussion of the [...] "super group" [...] that had played on the [...] "Beck's Bolero" [...] sessions in May 1966. The spelling of [...] "lead" [...] was changed to avoid confusion over the pronunciation. This effectively closed the books on the Yardbirds - at least by name - for the next 24 years.|$|R
500|$|The golden <b>ticket</b> <b>promotional</b> gimmick, {{from which}} the episode {{receives}} its title, is {{a reference to the}} golden tickets from the 1964 Roald Dahl novel, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, as well as the 1971 and 2005 film adaptations of the book. Throughout {{the first half of the}} episode, Michael wears a purple suit and top hat similar to Willy Wonka, the character responsible for the promotion from which this episode takes its name. Blue Cross of Pennsylvania, the Dunder Mifflin client who receives the Golden Tickets, is a real-life division of Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, an American health insurance company. After throwing away the Willy Wonka outfit, Michael wears a gray T-shirt advertising the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Pioneers, a minor league arena football team. One of the excuses Michael uses to avoid David's phone calls is that he is attending an [...] "Obama fashion show", a reference to U.S. President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama.|$|R
500|$|Before {{the first}} of the Australian shows, Minister for Fair Trading for New South Wales Virginia Judge, said she was aware that Spears would lipsync during the concerts and was {{considering}} to include disclaimers on <b>promotional</b> materials and <b>tickets,</b> indicating that portions of the show would be pre-recorded. This measures would mean a change in the country's legislation similar to the debacle of the 2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. Judge further explained her position saying, [...] "Let's be clear– live means live. If you are spending up to $200 I think you deserve better than a film clip". Tour director Steve Dixon defended Spears, claiming, [...] "This is a pop spectacular, this is a showband show. You come for the experience. There is a lot to see about this show, there's nothing like this in the world. Britney Spears will entertain you, that's what people come for. We absolutely give them a show". After opening night in Perth, The Advertiser writer Rebekah Devlin reported that a number of fans had walked out of the show. They were apparently [...] "disappointed" [...] and [...] "outraged" [...] regarding Spears's lip syncing and subdued dancing. Australian tour promoter Paul Dainty talked about the situation saying, ...|$|R

Australian tour promoter Paul Dainty talked about the situation saying,"It's the biggest lie I've ever heard. I'm so angry. We can take heat if there's something wrong and people can review shows badly - that's something you have to live with - but to say people stormed out of the show was an absolute fabrication. Britney is aware of all this and she's extremely upset by it. She's a human being. I'm embarrassed, with such a big international entourage here with Britney, {{to be part of the}} Australian media when I see that kind of totally inaccurate reporting. It's been all over the internet for nine months, the inference is that we tried to hide this. It's been the opposite. This show is about an incredible spectacle, which it is".Spears's manager Adam Leber responded in his Twitter account, saying, [...] "It's unfortunate that one journalist in Perth didn't enjoy the show last night. Fortunately the other 18,272 fans in attendance did". Spears's official website also posted a list of positive reviews from a number of fans. Burswood Dome also issued a statament reading, [...] "Last night's concert (Friday) saw record crowds turn out for her first performance in Perth and from Burswood's perspective the event was a huge success. Early media reports that hundreds of fans left the concert early cannot be substantiated and Burswood has received no complaints about the concert". Finally, Spears addressed the situation according to BBC Online. She was quoted as saying, [...] "I hear there is a lot of controversy in the media about my show. Some reporters have said they love it and some don't. I came to Australia for my fans". The negative media attention continued after her show in Melbourne when it was alleged that fans had placed tickets for the remaining Australian shows on sale on the online shopping website eBay, for as little as 99 cents. However, Dainty said that the holders of the tickets were not Spears's fans, stating [...] "They're just profiteers. They buy tickets for $200 and think they that when the concerts sell-out they will offload them for $500".|$|R
