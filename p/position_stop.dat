Articulatory data won via electromagnetic articulography of three Korean speakers and acoustic recordings of three Korean and three German speakers are analysed.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of multi-talker background noise on speech intelligibility in participants with hypophonia due to Parkinson’s disease (PD). Ten individuals with PD and 10 geriatric controls were tested on four speech intelligibility tasks at the single word, sentence, and conversation level in various conditions of background noise. Listeners assessed speech intelligibility using word identification or orthographic transcription procedures. Results revealed non-significant differences between groups when intelligibility was assessed in no background noise. PD speech intelligibility decreased significantly relative to controls {{in the presence of}} background noise. A phonetic error analysis revealed a distinct error profile for PD speech in background noise. The four most frequent phonetic errors were glottal-null, consonant-null in final <b>position,</b> <b>stop</b> place of articulation, and initial position cluster-singleton. The results demonstrate that individuals with PD have significant and distinctive deficits in speech intelligibility and phonetic errors in the presence of background noise...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considered}} the secured level crossing Signaling system and Train tracking system. This paper adopted a switching logic methodology {{to meet the}} challenges of the tracking system. This work also focused to map the train on the display screen. If the train moving close to the level crossing system the signaling system causes to release the green signal that causes to close the rail gate to avoid the unauthorized entry on the rail track. The open state of the gate is influenced by the signaling system by means of a ‘Red’colour signal. The train is allowed to move on the track only by considering the green signal. The rail track is organized with four <b>stop</b> <b>positions.</b> <b>Stop</b> 1, stop 2, stop 3 and stop 4. The locations of the train at various <b>stop</b> <b>positions</b> are sensed by using IR sensors. The detected signal is transmitted to the control room using RF transmitter operating at 433 MHZ. An Atmel micro controller is used to regulate the entire process to meet the desired state of the work. This proposed methodology had been successfully implemented on the 30 feet length of the scaled model of the rail track in the laboratory. The system results progressive response while tracking the position of the train. The results are recorded and analyzed. The proposed system may keep alert the monitoring mechanism. So, the collision of the train and unexpected human errors can be minimized...|$|R

50|$|Proportional Solenoid -Included in this {{category}} of solenoids are the uniquely designed magnetic circuits that effect analog positioning of the solenoid plunger or armature {{as a function of}} coil current. These solenoids, whether axial or rotary, employ a flux carrying geometry that both produces a high starting force (torque), and has a section that quickly begins to saturate magnetically. The resulting force (torque) profile as the solenoid progresses through its operational stroke is nearly flat or descends from a high to a lower value. The solenoid can be useful for <b>positioning,</b> <b>stopping</b> mid-stroke, or for low velocity actuation; especially in a closed loop control system. A uni-directional solenoid would actuate against an opposing force or a dual solenoid system would be self cycling. The proportional concept is more fully described in SAE publication 860759 (1986).|$|R
