50|$|Electric engines {{typically}} use batteries {{to store}} electricity {{which is used}} to <b>power</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motor.</b> The electric motor runs on an array of batteries. The battery delivers the power to the motor, which is either AC or DC. The difference between AC and DC motors is the sort of system that is required to run it in an electric vehicle. An AC motor is generally cheaper but the components required to run it in an electric vehicle such as the controller and inverter makes it more expensive than the DC motor. A unique feature of electric vehicles compared to its gasoline counterparts, the electric vehicle is more simple than the gasoline vehicle. The electric vehicle bypasses the gasoline car components such as the crankshaft which allows it to generate power much faster than gasoline. Because of the faster transfer of power, the electric vehicle is able to accelerate faster than gasoline cars.In the 1970s, the electric vehicle made its reappearance because of the 1973 OPEC Oil Embargo. Previously, the abundant gasoline had become the prime source of fuel for vehicles. But after the shortage, manufacturers began looking towards electric vehicles again. Despite the improved technology from the 1800s, the electric vehicles faced similar technological flaws such as limited mileage and speed. They could only travel up to 45 miles per hour and had a range of approximately 40 miles.|$|E

40|$|Potential {{shortage}} of world wide petroleum {{supply in the}} near future has created an enormous demand for green vehicles that use higher <b>power</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> drive in their traction systems. Application of power electronic modules in automobiles has generated the need for reliable and low-cost high-temperature electronics which can operate at the extreme temperatures that exist under the hood. In this paper, we are presenting an improved version of our earlier work on high-temperature and high-voltage integrated silicon-on-insulator (SOI) based gate circuit for SiC FET switches. This driver circuit has been designed and implemented using 0. 8 -micron, 2 -poly and 3 -metal BCD on SOI process. The prototype chip has been successfully tested up to 200 ºC ambient temperature without any heat sink or cooling mechanism. This gate-driver chip is intended to drive SiC power FETs in DC-DC converters in a hybrid electric vehicle. The converter modules along with the gate-driver chip may be placed next to the engine where the temperature can reach up to 175 ºC. Successful operation of the circuit at this temperature with minimal or no heat sink, and without liquid cooling, will help to achieve higher power-to-volume as well as power-to-weight ratios for the power electronics module...|$|E

40|$|This is an {{improved}} {{design of the}} manually operated pipe bending machine commonly used by local metal construction workers. The design ensures a smooth operation during the bending process during which the shape or length of the pipe is bent to a required angle. The bending force is provided {{by means of a}} gear assembly, powered by a 2 Horse <b>Power</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motor.</b> It is desired that the pipe material permanently yields under the applied force without breaking since upon removal of the force the material is not expected to recover its original shape (plastic deformation). Thus yield stress of the range of pipe thicknesses was duly considered in the design. The bending mechanism is achieved by use of a worm and flywheel gear assembly, a protractor scale for recording the angle of bend, a detachable handle, bend dies of different sizes (between 18 mm and 28 mm), bearings and flexible couplings. The machine can be used in rural areas where there is no power supply. In this case, the bending fork is disengaged from the flywheel and the detachable handle is connected to manually turn the fork. The test result shows a smooth pipe bending operation up to a pipe thickness of 2 mm. A square worm gave a relatively better result with the flywheel...|$|E
40|$|Slippage in {{the contact}} roller-races has always {{played a central}} role in the field of {{diagnostics}} of rolling element bearings. Due to this phenomenon, vibrations triggered by a localized damage are not strictly periodic and therefore not detectable by means of common spectral functions as power spectral density or discrete Fourier transform. Due to the strong second order cyclostationary component, characterizing these signals, techniques such as cyclic coherence, its integrated form and square envelope spectrum have proven to be effective in a wide range of applications. An expert user can easily identify a damage and its location within the bearing components by looking for particular patterns of peaks in the output of the selected cyclostationary tool. These peaks will be found in the neighborhood of specific frequencies, that can be calculated in advance as functions of the geometrical features of the bearing itself. Unfortunately the non-periodicity of the vibration signal is not the only consequence of the slippage: often it also involves a displacement of the damage characteristic peaks from the theoretically expected frequencies. This issue becomes particularly important in the attempt to develop highly automated algorithms for bearing damage recognition, and, in order to correctly set thresholds and tolerances, a quantitative description of the magnitude of the above mentioned deviations is needed. This paper is aimed at identifying the dependency of the deviations on the different operating conditions. This has been possible thanks to an extended experimental activity performed on a full scale bearing test rig, able to reproduce realistically the operating and environmental conditions typical of an industrial high <b>power</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> and gearbox. The importance of load will be investigated in detail for different bearing damages. Finally some guidelines on how to cope with such deviations will be given, accordingly to the expertise obtained in the experimental activity...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{deals with}} the design and {{performance}} analysis of centrifugal pump. In this paper, centrifugal pump is analyzed by using a single-stage end suction centrifugal pump. Two main components of a centrifugal pump are the impeller and the casing. The impeller is a rotating component and the casing is a stationary component. In centrifugal pump, water enters axially through the impeller eyes and water exits radially. The pump casing is to guide the liquid to the impeller, converts into pressure the high velocity kinetic energy of the flow from the impeller discharge and leads liquid away of the energy having imparted to the liquid comes from the volute casing. A design of centrifugal pump is carried out and analyzed {{to get the best}} performance point. The design and performance analysis of centrifugal pump are chosen because it is the most useful mechanical rotodynamic machine in fluid works which widely used in domestic, irrigation, industry, large plants and river water pumping system. Moreover, centrifugal pumps are produced by manufacturing processes in Myanmar. In this paper, the pump is driven by one horse <b>power</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> and the design is based on Berman Method. The head and flow rate of this pump are 10 m and 0. 179 m 3 /s and the motor speed is 2900 rpm. The low specific speed is chosen because the value of specific speed is 100. The number of impeller blade is 9 blades. The performance analysis of centrifugal pump is carried out after designing the dimensions of centrifugal pump. So, shock losses, impeller friction losses, volute friction losses, disk friction losses and recirculation losses of centrifugal pump are also considered in performance analysis of centrifugal pump.

40|$|Today {{transportation}} {{is one of}} the rapidly evolving technologies in the world. With the stringent mandatory emission regulations and high fuel prices, researchers and manufacturers are ever increasingly pushed to the frontiers of research in pursuit of alternative propulsion systems. Electrically propelled vehicles {{are one of the most}} promising solutions among all the other alternatives, as far as; reliability, availability, feasibility and safety issues are concerned. However, the shortcomings of a fully electric vehicle in fulfilling all performance requirements make the electrification of the conventional engine powered vehicles in the form of a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) the most feasible propulsion systems. The optimal combination of the properly sized components such as internal combustion engine, electric motor, energy storage unit are crucial for the vehicle to meet the performance requirements, improve fuel efficiency, reduce emissions, and cost effectiveness. ^ In this thesis an application of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) approach to optimally size the vehicle powertrain components (e. g. engine <b>power,</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> power, and battery energy capacity) while meeting all the critical performance requirements, such as acceleration, grade and maximum speed is studied. Compared to conventional optimization methods, PSO handles the nonlinear constrained optimization problems more efficiently and precisely. ^ The PHEV powertrain configuration with the determined sizes of the components has been used in a new vehicle model in PSAT (Powertrain System Analysis Toolkit) platform. The simulation results show that with the optimized component sizes of the PHEV vehicle (via PSO), the performance and the fuel efficiency of the vehicle are significantly improved. ^ The optimal solution of the component sizes found in this research increased the performance and the fuel efficiency of the vehicle. Furthermore, after reaching the desired values of the component sizes that meet all the performance requirements, the overall emission of hazardous pollutants from the PHEV powertrain is included in the optimization problem in order to obtain updated PHEV component sizes that would also meet additional design specifications and requirements. ...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{fundamental}} shift occurring {{in the design of}} passenger vehicles for North American markets. While for decades automotive manufacturers have relied on internal combustion engines burning fossil fuels, the early 21 st century has seen a departure from conventional thinking about powertrain design towards two new design paradigms: hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), and fuel cell vehicles (FCVs). Hybrid electric vehicles incorporate a high <b>power</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> and an electrical storage system which are used for motive power in addition to their conventional internal combustion engine (ICE). Fuel cell vehicles use a stack of individual cells to produce electric power which is then used in an electric motor to move the vehicle. They are generally fueled by a stream of high purity hydrogen, and produce only water as an emission. Both vehicle types use electric motors as an integral component in their configuration. The objective for this thesis is to propose a control strategy for the traction motors of a hybrid or electric vehicle. In particular, it addresses {{the question of how to}} split torque between two onboard electric motors while considering the efficiency, stability, and traction of the vehicle. This work is based upon two hybrid vehicles: a Chevrolet Equinox converted to a Fuel Cell HEV, and a Chrysler Pacifica converted to an internal combustion engine HEV. A torque control strategy is recommended that focuses on improved efficiency while addressing vehicle stability, and traction control. The strategy also incorporates powertrain component protection. Simulations indicate that the manner in which torque is split between the motors can have a large impact on the total efficiency of the powertrain; greater than 7 % improvement fuel economy is projected by using an intelligent torque control system over a iii FTP- 75 drive cycle. It is recommended that this work be extended to incorporate regenerative braking and a more thorough analysis of vehicle stability and drivability...|$|E
