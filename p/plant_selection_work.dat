40|$|Abstract <b>Plant</b> {{registration}} and <b>selection</b> <b>work</b> aimed at identifying the best genotypes for northern landscaping {{has been carried}} out in Finland since the 1980 ’s. In the University of Oulu Botanical Gardens, micropropagation methods have been developed for several woody plant taxa registered during the POHKAS (Northern Hardy Plants) project. Micropropagation is an effective method to conserve valuable genetic characteristics and to produce plantlets from woody species with limited mother stock material and in a limited time period. In this study the long-term field phenology and success of 19 micropropagated shrub and tree taxa was followed in <b>plant</b> <b>selection</b> experiments. Experiments were conducted at four northern field sites presenting different climatic conditions. Of the phenological monitoring parameters, the onset of foliation and flowering in the field revealed a strong relation to spring time temperature, being obviously latest to occur in northernmost site. The gradient between southern and northern sites for autumn phenology was not so obvious. However, between the different genotypes, the greatest differences were observed in the timing of autumn colouration and defoliation. Winter hardiness also showed clear differences between genotypes. Of the success parameters, it was most decisive as winter hardy genotypes had a higher occurrence of flowers and ornamental appearance, for example in Rosa majalis ‘Tornedal’. Some of these hardy genotypes with known characteristics were introduced to northern tourism areas to create examples of sustainable landscaping. Further, a list of potential plants for different northern sites was compiled. Special forms with both scientific and ornamental value are occasionally found in wild species. One example of this is the red-leaved form of a pubescent birch, Betula pubescens f. rubra, which was studied in the <b>plant</b> <b>selection</b> experiments, and was used as a model tree to evaluate the role of anthocyanins in northern plants in a case study of northern birches. In the case study, the red-leaved pubescent birch showed some differences in flavonoid responses and growth rate in comparison to Betula pubescens and Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii. Phenology of the B. p. f. rubra was corresponding to that of the B. pubescens. For cultivated woody plants the most important selection criteria for the northern areas are the suitability to local climate i. e. timing of phenological events and winter hardiness. Foliar anthocyanins seem to increase adaptation to northern growing conditions with high light intensity and low temperature...|$|R

40|$|Upland cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L., {{is grown}} {{extensively}} in the southern United States with an annual farmgate value of $ 6 billion and an annual national economic impact of over $ 120 billion. Damage due to biotic pests, including {{what is known as}} the cotton seedling disease complex (CSDC), contribute to these losses. Two particular CSDC pathogens, Rhizoctonia solani and Pythium ultimum, are the most significant soilborne pathogens of cotton in the United States. A program for R. solani and P. ultimum resistant cotton germplasm was established at Texas A&M University AgriLife Research. Five germplasm families selected for elevated levels of condensed tannins were evaluated for resistance to R. solani and P. ultimum. Two generations of single <b>plant</b> <b>selections</b> resulted in three generations, C_(0) (original families or Cycle 0) C_(1), selected from the C_(0) family, and C_(2), selected from the C_(1) generation. C_(1) and C_(2) were putative resistant families after one or two generation(s) of <b>selection,</b> respectively. Individual <b>plants</b> from the three generations within five families were challenged with either or both R. solani or P. ultimum to evaluate the progress of single <b>plant</b> <b>selection</b> for resistance. A susceptible cultivar for R. solani- and P. ultimum-resistance respectively, were included. Different R. solani and P. ultimum families from each generation of selection were evaluated at three inoculation levels with four replications per family. Differences in level of resistance between each generation were evaluated by comparing disease level in a randomized complete block. Cross-resistance was evaluated, i. e., C_(2) families originally screened under R. solani pressure were inoculated and screened for P. ultimum resistance and vice versa. Individual <b>plant</b> <b>selection</b> (IPS) in an artificial environment may be a useful and important tool in developing seedling disease-resistant cotton germplasm. Furthermore, it can be concluded that the family evaluated is of importance to determine the amount of progress made in terms of disease resistance with IPS.

40|$|The {{frequency}} of selection of functional groups and plant species by free-ranging cattle foraging in a diverse environment and its changes {{during the dry}} and the following prehumid seasons were investigated using direct observations and bite counting. The study was conducted at two sites in the Bolivian-Tucuman montane forests in southern Bolivia, by including datasets {{of a total of}} 16 animals. Across both study sites and the entire observation period (May to October/November), the cattle were found to select a broad spectrum of plant species from different functional groups. However, just a limited number of species made up a considerable contribution to overall <b>plant</b> <b>selection.</b> The functional group of the graminoids was selected most frequently, but their contribution to <b>plant</b> <b>selection</b> decreased significantly from 63. 5 % of total bites in May to 15. 9 % in September/October, in accordance with a decrease in availability. <b>Selection</b> of woody <b>plants</b> (shrubs and tree parts, the latter mainly in the form of leaf litter and fruits) increased with time, reaching its peak {{at the beginning of the}} prehumid season, while the herbs showed a curvilinear pattern of selection which was highest in August.
