5|$|The {{introduction}} of the postage stamp, along with daily delivery, allowed a large increase in the volume of mail carried. By 1849, between ten and fifteen million letters were being carried each year. The creation of the stamps also led to a structural expansion of the national postage system, which in 1830 had counted just 123 post offices and 240 <b>postmen.</b>|$|E
5|$|The stamps {{were sold}} from post-offices {{across the country}} but some were also issued to <b>postmen</b> for sale. Sales started on 25 June 1849, however their use only became legal on 1 July. Because {{of the lack of}} an {{infrastructure}} of post boxes, particularly in rural areas, letters could be given directly to the postman in person rather than delivered to post offices to be sent.|$|E
5|$|Initially, it was rumoured that, {{following}} the armistice, all French {{troops would be}} soon returned by the Germans. From the autumn of 1940, the Germans began to repatriate French reservists whose private occupations were in short supply in Vichy France, such as medical workers like doctors and nurses along with <b>postmen</b> and gendarmes. In 1941, after lobbying by the Vichy government, the policy was extended to French veterans of World War I and fathers of four or more children. Individual prisoners with good contacts could also be requested for repatriation. In practice, this meant that {{a disproportionate number of}} prisoners who were released early came from the upper classes.|$|E

5|$|It {{was also}} {{reported}} that the CWU had started a fighting fund to help support postal workers who were experiencing financial difficulties {{as a result of}} the strike. <b>Postmen</b> lose a day's pay for each day they strike, and although most workers had lost just two days pay so far, many in the London area who had taken part in previous industrial action earlier in the year had lost as much as 18 days of wages. There was also speculation that the CWU lacked the funds for a lengthy dispute and donations to the union's fighting fund were pledged by other unions, including UNISON and Unite.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, the Daily Mirror {{newspaper}} printed {{pictures of}} Arsenal fans {{alleged to have}} been part of the violence. It later arose that the majority of the people in the photos were either not involved or had been acting in self-defence. The photos led to some <b>postmen</b> working for Royal Mail losing their jobs because they had been seen in the photos and in television coverage, even though they had not been arrested. Michael Doherty, the chairman of the Communication Workers Union, and his brother Tom took Royal Mail to an Employment Tribunal for unfair dismissal claiming they had been acting in self-defence. In 2001, the tribunal ruled in their favour, and ordered Royal Mail to reinstate them. In 2012, the editor of the Daily Mirror at the time, Piers Morgan apologised for printing the pictures.|$|E

25|$|The postal {{system was}} {{important}} {{in the development of}} modern transportation. Railways carried railway post offices.

25|$|The {{history of}} winter {{navigation}} in Finland {{dates back to}} the 17th century when mail was carried year-round between Turku, Finland and Grisslehamn, Sweden, over the Sea of Åland. During the winter season, the <b>postmen</b> used ice boats, strengthened sleigh-boats that were pushed over the ice until it gave in {{under the weight of the}} boat. Once in water, the men began rocking the boat back and forth until it slowly began to break the ice and proceed towards open water. The mail route was often called the most dangerous in Europe.|$|E

25|$|Slovak sources {{usually do}} not deny that many Hungarian {{teachers}} (replaced in Slovak schools by Slovak and Czech teachers), railwaymen (on strike against new Czechoslovak republic in February 1919), <b>postmen,</b> policemen, soldiers and civil clerks (replaced by Czech and Slovak soldiers, policemen and clerks) were forced to leave or left for Hungary voluntarily, the numbers however are unclear but census do show a rapid {{decline in the number}} of people with Hungarian as a mother tongue. Some teachers and civil servants were expelled from Czechoslovakia while some left due to the harsh circumstances. There are many examples of Hungarians who were forced to leave their homes from this territory (two famous ones are the families of Béla Hamvas, and of Albert Szent-Györgyi). The high number of refugees (and even more from Romania) necessitated entire new housing projects in Budapest (Mária-Valéria telep, Pongrácz-telep), which gave shelter to refugees numbering at least in the ten-thousands.|$|E
25|$|Scouting for Boys (1908) was Baden-Powell's rewrite of {{his earlier}} book Aids to Scouting (1899) with many youth {{training}} ideas openly taken from The Birch Bark Roll of the Woodcraft Indians (1906) written by Ernest Thompson Seton, who later became the Chief Scout of the Boy Scouts of America. Aids to Scouting was mostly a written explanation of the military scouting and self-reliance skills lessons Baden-Powell had learned from Frederick Russell Burnham, the British Army Chief of Scouts, but following the siege of Mafeking this military handbook unexpectedly became popular with many youth groups and educators, like Charlotte Mason, in Britain. At Mafeking, Baden-Powell's adjutant had recruited and trained boys aged 12–15 as cadets and during the siege they acted as <b>postmen,</b> messengers, and later to carry the wounded, to free men for fighting. Upon his return to England, following the Second Boer War, Baden-Powell learned some British schools had been using Aids to Scouting to teach observation and deduction. In 1906, Seton discussed youth training ideas with Baden-Powell and shared with him a copy of The Birch Bark Roll of the Woodcraft Indians. Soon after, Baden-Powell decided to revise Aids to Scouting into a book for boys. Several friends supported Baden-Powell, including Sir William Alexander Smith, founder of the Boys' Brigade, and Cyril Arthur Pearson, who owned newspapers and printing presses. Baden-Powell wrote a draft, then called Boy Patrols, which he used and tested with 22 boys for one week at camp on Brownsea Island {{in the summer of}} 1907, where Pearson's literary editor Percy Everett assisted.|$|E

40|$|The mixed <b>postman</b> problem {{consists}} {{of finding a}} minimum cost tour of a mixed graph M = (V, E, A) traversing all its edges and arcs at least once. We prove that two well-known linear programming relaxations of this problem are equivalent. The extra cost of a mixed <b>postman</b> tour T {{is the cost of}} T minus the cost of the edges and arcs of M. We prove that it is NP -hard to approximate the minimum extra cost of a mixed <b>postman</b> tour. A related problem, known as the windy <b>postman</b> problem, {{consists of}} finding a minimum cost tour of an undirected graph G =(V, E) traversing all its edges at least once, where the cost of an edge depends on the direction of traversal. We say that G is windy <b>postman</b> perfect if a certain windy <b>postman</b> polyhedron O (G) is integral. We prove that series-parallel undirected graphs are windy <b>postman</b> perfect, therefore solving a conjecture of Win. Given a mixed graph M = (V, E, A) and a subset R &# 8838; E &# 8746; A, we say that a mixed <b>postman</b> tour of M is restricted if it traverses the elements of R exactly once. The restricted mixed <b>postman</b> problem consists of finding a minimum cost restricted tour. We prove that this problem is NP -hard even if R = A and we restrict M to be planar, hence solving a conjecture of Veerasamy. We also prove that it is NP -complete to decide whether there exists a restricted tour even if R = E and we restrict M to be planar. The edges <b>postman</b> problem is the special case of the restricted mixed <b>postman</b> problem when R = A. We give a new class of valid inequalities for this problem. We introduce a relaxation of this problem, called the b-join problem, that can be solved in polynomial time.

The arcs <b>postman</b> problem is the special case of the restricted mixed <b>postman</b> problem when R = E. We introduce a class of necessary conditions for M to have an arcs <b>postman</b> tour, and we give a polynomial-time algorithm to decide whether one of these conditions holds.
