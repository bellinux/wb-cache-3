5|$|The Crafoord Prize is {{an annual}} science prize {{established}} in 1980 by Holger Crafoord, a Swedish industrialist, {{and his wife}} Anna-Greta Crafoord. The Prize is awarded in partnership between the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and the Crafoord Foundation in Lund. The Academy is responsible for selecting the Crafoord Laureates. The prize is awarded in four categories: astronomy and mathematics; geosciences; biosciences, with particular emphasis on ecology; and <b>polyarthritis,</b> the disease from which Holger severely suffered in his last years.|$|E

25|$|Arthritis {{of joints}} {{involves}} {{inflammation of the}} synovial membrane. Joints become swollen, tender and warm, and stiffness limits their movement. With time, multiple joints are affected (<b>polyarthritis).</b> Most commonly involved are the small joints of the hands, feet and cervical spine, but larger joints like the shoulder and knee can also be involved. Synovitis can lead to tethering of tissue with loss of movement and erosion of the joint surface causing deformity and loss of function.|$|E
25|$|S.dysgalactiae {{has been}} {{isolated}} from infectious <b>polyarthritis</b> in several animal species, including piglets, lambs, calves and goats. Furthermore, {{it has been}} implicated in neonatal mortality among puppies. Recently, SDSD {{has been described as}} an emerging pathogen in fish, causing fulminant necrotic ulcers of the caudal peduncle, with ensuing high mortality rates. The clinical presentation is dominated by severe sepsis and the formation of microabscesses, and a relationship between disease severity and the expression of the virulence factors Streptolysin S and SPEGdys has been inferred.|$|E
500|$|According to the Academy, [...] "these {{disciplines}} {{are chosen}} {{so as to}} complement those for which the Nobel Prizes are awarded". Only one award is given each year, according to a rotating scheme – astronomy and mathematics; then geosciences; then biosciences. A Crafoord Prize in <b>polyarthritis</b> is only awarded when a special committee decides that substantial progress in the field has been made. The recipient of the Crafoord Prize is announced each year in mid-January; on Crafoord Day in April, the prize is presented by the King of Sweden, who also presents the Nobel Prizes at the ceremony in December. The prize money, which [...] is 6,000,000 kr (or US$700,000), is intended to fund further research by the laureate.|$|E

2500|$|Clinical {{signs in}} cats {{infected}} with FCV may develop acutely, chronically, {{or not at}} all. [...] Latent or subclinical infections often become clinical when the cat is stressed, such as {{at the time of}} adoption. [...] Acute signs of FCV include fever, conjunctivitis, nasal discharge, sneezing, and ulceration of the mouth (stomatitis). [...] Pneumonia may develop with secondary bacterial infections. [...] In addition to stomatitis, some cats may develop a <b>polyarthritis,</b> both probably immune-mediated through immune complex deposition. [...] Stomatitis and <b>polyarthritis</b> can develop without any upper respiratory infection signs, but fever and loss of appetite may occur. [...] Less commonly, glomerulonephritis can develop in chronic cases secondary to immune complex deposition. [...] The great variability of clinical signs in individual cases of FCV is related to the relative virulence of different strains of the virus.|$|E
2500|$|There is no {{specific}} treatment for FCV. [...] Antibiotics {{are used for}} secondary bacterial infections, and immune modulators, such as lymphocyte T-cell immune modulator, {{have been used for}} immune support. Nursing care and rehydration are used for dehydrated and anorexic cats. [...] Corticosteroids or azathioprine may be used for <b>polyarthritis.</b> Stomatitis is very difficult to treat. [...] Antibiotics, corticosteroids, and tooth extractions all have been used with varying success. [...] Cats on corticosteroids must be monitored carefully for worsening of any upper respiratory infection.|$|E
