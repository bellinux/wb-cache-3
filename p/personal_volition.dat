50|$|Self-determination theory (SDT) is {{a theory}} of {{motivation}} and dedication towards our ambition. Self-determination theory (SDT) focuses on the interplay between individual personalities and experiences in social contexts that results in motivations of the autonomous and controlled kind. Ultimately, social environments {{seem to have a}} profound effect on both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and self-regulation. More specifically, self-determination theory proposes that social and cultural factors influence an individual’s sense of <b>personal</b> <b>volition</b> and initiative in regards to goals, performance and well-being. High levels of determination and <b>personal</b> <b>volition</b> are supported by conditions that foster autonomy (e.g., individual has multiple options/choices), competence (e.g., positive feedback) and relatedness (e.g., stable connection to the group an individual is working within).|$|E

40|$|Wole Soyinka {{was awarded}} the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1986, the first African {{recipient}} of this honour, for his body of works covering plays, novels and poetry. Soyinka is also a literary and cultural theorist, a memoirist, and a social activist, known internationally for his campaign against tyranny and injustice. This and many other dimensions of {{his career as a}} man of letters, his cultural background and the postcolonial context in which he writes flow freely into his creative works. This study describes Soyinka’s theatre, based on eight major plays published between 1960 and 1996. This is the peak of Soyinka’s literary career and provides the most illustrative instances of the maturation of his art and thematic concerns. Using the selected plays as focal points, a critical appraisal of Soyinka’s characters and their cosmos, and the development of the key ingredients of his theatre is undertaken. It is argued that Soyinka’s theatre portrays a liminal world in which myth, ritual and postcolonialism are ascendant elements. The main framework for this argument is Barthes’s poststructuralism but other theorists apply as well, including Bhabha, Eco, Foucault, Hutcheon, Jeyifo, Jung, Kristeva, Levinas, Olaniyan, Turner, Van Gennep, Vermeulen and Akker, and Soyinka himself. Accordingly, this study opens new frontiers on Soyinka by delving into key concepts such as liminality, postcoloniality, modernism, postmodernism, metamodernism, abjection, “othering”, and intertexuality as they apply to Soyinka’s theatre. It features a wide-ranging discourse on Soyinka’s “fourth stage” as a form of applied dramatic theory in which the poetics of myth and ritual and the postcolonial distinctions of Soyinka’s theatre find congruence. Myth and ritual ensconce Soyinka’s dramatis personae in a way that prepares them for and, crucially, prevents them from overcoming the gulf between their <b>personal</b> <b>volitions</b> and the will of their community. ...|$|R

50|$|William James (1890) {{proposed}} {{a distinction between}} the I and the Me, which, according to Morris Rosenberg, is a classic distinction in the psychology of the self. According to James the I is equated with the self-as-knower and has three features: continuity, distinctness, and volition. The continuity of the self-as-knower is expressed in a sense of personal identity, that is, a sense of sameness through time. A feeling of distinctness from others, or individuality, is also characteristic of the self-as-knower. Finally, a sense of <b>personal</b> <b>volition</b> is reflected in the continuous appropriation and rejection of thoughts by which the self-as-knower manifests itself as an active processor of experience.|$|E
40|$|Information {{technology}} (IT) adoption research recognizes theoretical {{limitations in}} discerning {{if and when}} user behavior results from perceived external influences or from <b>personal</b> <b>volition.</b> A clear understanding of this issue requires a precise distinction between mandatory and volitional behaviors. Consistent with organismic integration theory (OIT), this study situates the locus of user motivations inside the user. Drawing upon an endogenous view of behaviors, this research makes three key contributions. First, it develops the theoretical basis for clearly discerning if and when behavior results from perceived external influences or from <b>personal</b> <b>volition.</b> Specifically, it examines how endogenous psychological feelings of autonomy, freedom, conflict, and external pressure can predict and explain user intentions. Second, it proposes that behavior may result from combinations of perceived external influences and <b>personal</b> <b>volition.</b> Recognizing how such "collections of motivations" together influence behavior advances our understanding beyond the "dichotomy" of extrinsic versus intrinsic motivations often adopted in prior research. Third, it proposes that some desired behaviors may be thwarted or impeded by a conflict between perceived external influences and <b>personal</b> <b>volition.</b> The theoretically grounded research model was empirically validated in a field study on Blackboard, a Web-based education platform at a large university. Data collected from a sample of 211 users were tested using structural equation models of initial system adoption and experienced use. Empirical support was found for the proposed model and related hypotheses. The {{results of this study}} advance our understanding about user motivations for adopting IT. © 2008 M. E.

40|$|Idealized {{presentations of}} female {{behavior}} prescribed by Ban Zhao (A. D. 45 - 120) and later male Confucians defined {{women in the}} role of inner helpers, thus confining them to the domestic arena. Close scrutiny of data however reveals a cluster of new values for Song women evident through personal cultivation and devotional practices both "within" and "without" the inner sphere. This dissertation offers a preliminary investigation of Song women's practices such as bodily and spiritual cultivations as well as their devotional and philanthropic activities. It examines why and how these specific inner and outer practices evolved into regnant womanly practices that ultimately becarne exemplary behaviors during the Song period. Through the lens of female daily practices, this study also investigates the diverse interactions between genders in the Song era. The first part of this dissertation explores Song women's bodily and spiritual observances within the inner quarters. Song women performed bodily cultivations through various forms of ascetic behaviors, including fasting, vegetarianism, the abstinence from slaughtering living beings, and seclusion in their daily lives, which can be deemed gendered practices. Spiritual cultivation through religious practices such as sutra recitation and other related observances functioned not only as accessible avenues of female spiritual pursuits, but also served as alternative conduits for Song women's literary aspirations. Part Two first discusses the gender discourse and the tension between the norms and historical reality during the Song. The last two chapters examine Song women's practices such as their religious offerings and involvement in community public works and philanthropy outside the domestic realm. In contrast to women's inner practices, women's outer sphere endeavors put their <b>personal</b> cultivation and <b>volition</b> into practice, and also extended their influential financial autonomy beyond the domestic arena into the greater society. This study concludes that despite deviations from conventional Confucian values, these inner and outer womanly practices were perceived as paragons of female virtues. Lastly, it suggests a negotiated process in the workings of gender in the Song culture...|$|R
40|$|Most {{schools in}} {{psychology}} have emphasized individual choice despite evidence of genetic and cultural determinism. It is suggested {{in this paper}} that the rejection of classical behaviorism by psychology and other humanities flowed from deeply held cultural assumptions about volition and free will. While compatibilists have suggested that notions of free will and determinism are not mutually exclusive, the psychological mechanisms by which such an accommodation could be explained have been inadequately explored. Drawing on research into classical cultures, this paper builds an argument {{that the notion of}} free will was adaptive flowing from culturally evolved changes to the self, and that this “evolved self,” containing assumptions of <b>personal</b> <b>volition,</b> continuity, and reason, became benchmarks {{of what it means to}} be human. The paper proposes a model of a culturally evolved self that is compatible with understandings of free will and determinism.

40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} process of desistance of juvenile offenders. Aim of the research is to understand how juveniles {{with a history of}} persistent offending perceive the factors that have led to cessation of deviant behavior and supported their desistance from crime. Eight Finnish men aged 16 - 30 years were interviewed for the study. Data was collected using open interviews and analyzed by narrative analysis. Life course model is used as a theoretical framework to explain how life history and social context affect human agency. Findings {{of this study indicate that}} the negative experiences related to criminal life and substance abuse, such as constant threat of violence, initiate a volition in the juveniles to break away of the criminal life. This <b>personal</b> <b>volition</b> starts {{the process of}} desistance. In addition, supportive environment and alternative possibilities that the juveniles perceive as meaningful enhance desistance from crime. Important supporting environments for desistance are peer support networks, official services and social relationships, such as family. Desistance is also supported by the juveniles? belief in self-efficacy and experiences of succeeding, and pro-social goals for the future and belief in being able to achieve them.

40|$|The {{general purpose}} of the {{research}} study reported here was to gather students’ perceptions of factors which influenced their progress with Tertiary Preparation Program (TPP) studies at the University of Southern Queensland. A considerable body of research has been published on factors that affect the progression of undergraduate students. No similar studies with pre-tertiary bridging program students {{have been found in}} the literature. The main methodology employed in the study was analysis of data gathered by the use of a self-report questionnaire. Construction of the questionnaire was based on the outcomes of a study, undertaken by the author and a colleague in 2004 - 5, of factors which influence undergraduate student progression. The questionnaire was delivered to all students enrolled in the core course TPP 7120 in a sample of semesters in a sample of years from 2006 to 2009. The results of the study reported here indicate that factors perceived by students to have most strongly influenced them to discontinue their studies were those relating to personal circumstances that were beyond the control of the course teaching team or the University. Factors which were perceived by students to have most strongly influenced them to continue included factors related to <b>personal</b> <b>volition,</b> social/family support, institutional support, {{and the quality of the}} teaching-learning experience.

40|$|In the 21 st century, {{there is}} a growing {{realisation}} that providing principals with the necessary opportunities of training in leadership and management skills has become increasingly important as a way to increase school effectiveness and achieve quality performance. Central to this argument is the fact that principals are merely accorded a status and role without the necessary training. The {{purpose of this study was}} therefore to explore the effectiveness of state-funded professional development programmes of school principals with specific reference to Soshanguve secondary schools and also to ascertain the extent to which principals’ training meets the schools’ and principals’ needs given the changed conditions that exist in the country. The study employed a quantitative research methods approach to collect data from 100 educators and 20 Head of Departments (HoDs). This was done through administration of questionnaires. Data was analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), which was used to generate the frequencies and descriptive statistics that were used to answer research questions. While it is expected that principals should effectively and rigorously be developed to enable them to improve teaching and learning at their schools, the study, however, found that training of school principals in Soshanguve was elusive and ineffective, and as result, the majority of these principals lack basic management training prior to and after their entry into principalship. The study has shown that apart from being faced with various challenges and being promoted to principalship without the necessary leadership experience, principals rely on trial-and-error experience and common sense in leading and managing schools. The study also showed that a majority of principals are in great need of being professionally developed in some specific areas. Furthermore, the study discovered that the Department of Basic Education does not seem to be making efforts in ensuring that principals are professionally developed. Consequently, principals develop on their own through informal professional development strategies. In conclusion, the study recommended, amongst others, that principals should be encouraged to take personal responsibility and initiative in preparing and developing school leadership through self-study, reading literature, attending seminars and workshops out of their own <b>personal</b> <b>volition.</b> That Department of Basic Education (DoBE) needs to look into ways of subsidising the training of school principals. DoBE should also find ways of formally incorporating more of the private sector and non-governmental organisations to help in the preparation and development of principals for school leadership by allowing them to offer in-service courses for potential principals and serving principals.

40|$|Background Physical {{activity}} (PA) {{has been}} recognized to positively affect prevention and treatment of mental disorders (Faulkner & Biddle, 2002), unfortunately PA levels and fitness of psychiatric patients are usually very low (Vancampfort et al., 2011). Active lifestyle and regular exercise need to be supported by personal motivation, and people with mental diseases are often characterized by lack of motivation and poorer networks that negatively influence <b>personal</b> <b>volition</b> and coping abilities. Recent studies underlined the importance to promote intrinsic motivation to engage individuals in targeted behaviors, stimulating enjoyment and personal satisfaction rather than external reward (Choi et al., 2010). The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of a multidimensional approach on motivation, enjoyment and perceived benefits and barriers toward exercise, in a group of psychiatric inpatients. Materials and Method Participants were a mixed-gender sample of 53 psychiatric inpatients (men n = 21; women n = 32; mean age = 47. 7 years, SD = 10. 4 years; mean BMI = 26. 5, SD = 5. 4) attending a multidimensional treatment program including group-based exercise programs. Before to enter the study participants completed the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), 58. 5 % of them reported a low level of habitual PA, 20. 8 % a moderate and 20, 8 % a high PA level. They filled in a package of questionnaires before and at the end of the intervention (corresponding with the discharge from the hospital). The Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES) was used to assess enjoyment. The Situational Motivation Scale (SIMS) was used to test motivational aspects. Perceived benefits and barriers of PA were investigated with the Decisional Balance Scale (DBS). Results At baseline participants did not report significant differences in questionnaires values, neither by gender nor by IPAQ categories. At baseline, significant negative associations were found between BMI and positive scales (p <. 01), in particular with PACES (pros scores), DBS and SIMS intrinsic motivation and identified regulation subscales. Positive associations were found between BMI and the negative subscales: SIMS amotivation and PACES-cons. Paired t-test shown significant differences in post versus pre scores of SIMS amotivation subscale (t(52) = - 2. 68, p <. 05) and DBS (t(52) = 3. 36, p <. 01). Discussion Data underlined that high BMI is associated with low level of enjoyment, perceived benefits, and intrinsic motivation toward exercise. Moreover, results suggested that a multidimensional approach, also when corresponding to a short-time intervention (hospitalization reported a 33 -day mean length), could improve motivational attitude and the perception of benefits toward exercise among people with mental health problems. Further research is necessary to understanding long-term effect of exercise training by means of follow-up evaluations and objective measure of leisure time PA levels...|$|E
