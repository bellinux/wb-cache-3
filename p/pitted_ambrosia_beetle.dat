[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Knowledge of how exotic <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> influence microbe communities and how forest characteristics affect <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetle</b> abundance will improve policy and management decision. This study aimed to characterize the <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetle</b> community in the oak-hickory forest, determine <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetle</b> habitat and host use, and investigate if Xylosandrus crassiusculus influences early microbe colonization of dead wood. Thirteen native and seven exotic <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetle</b> species occurred in a central Missouri oak-hickory forest, however, the exotic component dominated the <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetle</b> community. Stand characteristics influenced <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetle</b> abundance but not the percent contribution of the exotic component, whereas, dead wood size influenced abundance and the percent contribution of the exotic component. Xylosandrus crassiusculus females increased the diversity and occurrence of microbes for a six month period. <b>Ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> likely alter microbe diversity and abundance and modifying forest characteristics by management may be a potential method to manage exotic <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetle</b> abundance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. 1. Bark and <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> {{are crucial}} for woody biomass {{decomposition}} in tropical forests worldwide. Despite that, quantitative data on their host specificity are scarce. 2. Bark and <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> (Scolytinae and Platypodinae) were reared from 13 species of tropical trees representing 11 families from all major lineages of dicotyledonous plants. Standardised samples of beetle-infested twigs, branches, trunks, and roots {{were taken from}} three individuals of each tree species growing in a lowland tropical rain-forest in Papua New Guinea. 3. A total of 81742 beetles from 74 species were reared, 67 of them identified. Local species richness of bark and <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> was estimated at 80 - 92 species. 4. <b>Ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> were broad generalists as 95 % of species did not show any preference for a particular host species or clade. Similarity of <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetle</b> communities from different tree species was not correlated with phylogenetic distances between tree species. Similarity of <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetle</b> communities from individual conspecific trees was not higher than that from heterospecific trees and {{different parts of the}} trees hosted simila...|$|R

50|$|<b>Ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> are beetles of the weevil subfamilies Scolytinae and Platypodinae (Coleoptera, Curculionidae), which live in {{nutritional}} symbiosis with ambrosia fungi {{and probably}} with bacteria. The beetles excavate tunnels in dead or live trees {{in which they}} cultivate fungal gardens, their sole source of nutrition.After landing on a suitable tree, an <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetle</b> excavates a tunnel in which it releases spores of its fungal symbiont. The fungus penetrates the plant's xylem tissue, digests it, and concentrates the nutrients on and near {{the surface of the}} beetle gallery. The majority of <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> colonize xylem (sapwood and/or heartwood) of dying or recently dead trees, but some attack live trees. Species differ in their preference for different parts of trees, different stages of deterioration, and in the shape of their tunnels ("galleries"). However, the majority of <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> are not specialized to any taxonomic group of hosts, unlike most phytophagous organisms including the closely related bark beetles.One species of <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetle,</b> Austroplatypus incompertus exhibits eusociality, one of the few organisms outside of Hymenoptera to do so.|$|R
40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the effect of}} geographical distance on insect species turnover {{in a situation where}} other major environmental factors, including host plant species, altitude, and climate, were constant. We sampled <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> (Coleoptera, Curculionidae: Scolytinae and Platypodinae) from four tree species: Artocarpus altilis, Ficus nodosa, Leea indica and Nauclea orientalis, at three sites forming a 1000 km transect in lowland rainforests of northern Papua New Guinea. A standardized volume of wood from trunk, branches and twigs was sampled for <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> from three individuals of the four tree species at each site. Each tree was killed standing and left exposed to beetle colonization for 20 days prior to sampling. We obtained 12 751 individuals from 84 morphospecies of <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles.</b> We surveyed most of the local species richness at each site, predicted by Chao 2 species richness estimates. The similarity of <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetle</b> communities, estimated by Chao-Sorensen index, was not correlated with their geographical distance. Likelihood analysis and Q-mode analysis using Monte Carlo-generated null distribution of beetles among sites supported the hypothesis that the assemblages of <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> at different sites are drawn from the same species pool, regardless of their geographical distance. Tree part (trunk, branch, or twig) was more important predictor of the composition of <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetle</b> communities than was the host species or geographical location. All three variables, however, explained {{only a small portion of}} variability in ambrosia assemblages. The distribution of <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> among tree parts, tree species and study sites was mostly random, suggesting limited importance of host specificity or dispersal limitation...|$|R

40|$|Size is a {{defining}} feature {{of an animal}} and is a result of counteracting forces of selection, and studying size and SSD can reveal what drives selection of body size in a given direction. Scolytinae and Platypodinae are diverse groups, representing many different mating systems and feeding strategies, and are for this reason interesting research subjects. The influence of mating systems, initiating sex, feeding type and initiating sex on evolution of size in species of bark and <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> was investigated for nine species of <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> and twelve species of bark beetles. Male biased SSD was found in all highly polygynous species of both bark and <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles.</b> In mildly polygynous and monogynous species, patterns were more diffuse, but in monogynous bark beetles there appeared to be a trend of female biased SSD. In several male initiated systems, where width of females is restricted, females were shown to evolve longer bodies than males. <b>Ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> had much less variation in the traits measured than did bark beetles, possibly caused by either tunneling practices or the more uniform resource quality of <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles.</b> Female initiated species of bark beetles were significantly wider than male initiated species, suggesting that male initiation limits evolution of body size...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2005 The nursery {{industry}} plays {{a critical}} role in Oregon's economy. An increase in wood-boring insect, or borer, activity has impacted the industry. The goal of this research is to determine key borer species in the nursery industry, flight times so targeted spray schedules can be established, and assess grower knowledge of borer issues and their management. <b>Ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> were found to be important with focus on three key species: Monarthrum scutellare (LeConte), Xyleborus dispar (F.), and Xyleborinus saxesenii (Ratzeburg). Flight times were monitored from 7 May 2003 to 3 September 2003 and 18 February 2004 to 1 September 2004, using Lindgren funnel traps. The greatest number of <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> for all species peaked in April, with a later peak in June for X saxesenii. The greatest number of specimens collected was X saxesenii. All species combined, a greater number of <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> were trapped in 2003 than in 2004. A survey ofgrowers in the Willamette Valley indicates that retail container operations spend more money on control than wholesale field growers. The average loss of trees was greater in 2003 than in 2004. Both retail and wholesale growers feel that <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> are of equal importance.

40|$|Non-native {{bark and}} <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> {{represent}} {{a threat to}} forests worldwide. Their invasion patterns are, however, still unclear. Here we investigated first, if the spread of non-native bark and <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> is a gradual or a discontinuous process; second, which are the main correlates of their community structure; third, whether those correlates correspond to those of native species. We used data on species distribution of non-native and native scolytines in the continental 48 USA states. These data were analyzed through a beta-diversity index, partitioned into species richness differences and species replacement, using Mantel correlograms and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination for identifying spatial patterns, and regression on distance matrices to test the association of climate (temperature, rainfall), forest (cover area, composition), geographical (distance), and human-related (import) variables with β-diversity components. For both non-native bark and <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles,</b> β-diversity was mainly composed of species richness difference than species replacement. For non-native bark beetles, a discontinuous invasion process composed of long distance jumps or multiple introduction events was apparent. Species richness differences were primarily correlated with differences in import values while temperature was the main correlate of species replacement. For non-native <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles,</b> a more continuous invasion process was apparent, with the pool of non-native species arriving in the coastal areas that tended to be filtered as they spread to interior portions of the continental USA. Species richness differences were mainly correlated with differences in rainfall among states, while rainfall and temperature were the main correlates of species replacement. Our study suggests that the different ecology of bark and <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles</b> influences their invasion process in new environments. The lower dependency that bark beetles have on climate allowed them to potentially colonize more areas within the USA, while non-native <b>ambrosia</b> <b>beetles,</b> being dependent on rainfall, are typically filtered by the environment...|$|R
