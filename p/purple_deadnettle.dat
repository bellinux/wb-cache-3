40|$|There {{are reports}} from Iowa State University Extension field crops specialists {{that there are}} lots of winter annual weeds in Iowa this spring. There is usually not much {{discussion}} about weeds serving as hosts for the soybean cyst nematode (SCN) because none of the common in-season weeds are hosts for the nematode in Iowa. In the late 1990 s, Ohio State University researchers reported that the winter annual weeds field penny-cress, henbit, and <b>purple</b> <b>deadnettle</b> supported SCN reproduction in greenhouse experiments...|$|E
40|$|The {{frequency}} of occurrence of winter annual weeds in Iowa fields has increased as more fields are managed with no-till production practices. And in recent years, scientists have discovered that the winter annual weeds <b>purple</b> <b>deadnettle,</b> henbit and field pennycress are moderate to good hosts for the soybean cyst nematode (SCN). Iowa growers and crop advisors are inquiring whether winter annual weeds could be supporting SCN reproduction leading to increases in SCN population densities. The answer depends on soil temperature...|$|E
40|$|Certain winter {{annual weeds}} have been {{documented}} as alternative hosts to soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines Ichinohe; SCN) and growth of such species has become common in no-till production fields in Indiana. Current management systems for SCN include rotation to a non-host crop and use of SCN-resistant soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr. ] varieties but fail to address winter annual weed management. This research was conducted to advance {{our understanding of the}} relationship between SCN and its winter weed hosts and to evaluate management strategies to reduce the collective impact of winter annual weeds and SCN on no-till production systems. Field surveys indicated that winter weed hosts of SCN were present in most Indiana production fields and often occurred at high densities. The most severe infestations of winter annual weeds were generally located in the southern region of the state. SCN reproduction on henbit (Lamium amplexicaule L.) and <b>purple</b> <b>deadnettle</b> (Lamium purpureum L.) was found to be common in the eastern Corn-Belt and generally occurred at higher levels in the fall than the spring. In a growth chamber experiment, SCN juveniles were able to survive a period of cold temperature inside the roots of a winter annual and continue development when transferred to warmer temperatures. <b>Purple</b> <b>deadnettle</b> was generally a more compatible host to SCN than henbit in the greenhouse. However, at high densities, henbit supported SCN reproduction at levels near those of <b>purple</b> <b>deadnettle.</b> In field experiments, SCN population densities were reduced by crop rotation but were not influenced by winter annual weed management. Fall and/or spring herbicide applications were a more effective option than wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) or annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) cover crops both in terms of reducing winter annual weed growth/seed production and minimizing the potential for crop yield loss. The results of these experiments suggest that inclusion of corn into a cropping sequence is a much more valuable SCN management tool than winter weed management. In addition, control of winter annual weeds, specifically for SCN management, may not be warranted in fields with low weed density. ...|$|E
40|$|Soybean cyst {{nematode}} (SCN; Heterodera glycines) causes more economic damage to U. S. soybean producers {{than any other}} soybean pathogen. Greenhouse and field {{studies have shown that}} the winter annual weed <b>purple</b> <b>deadnettle</b> (PDN) is an alternate host of SCN. Previous work has shown that Italian ryegrass significantly reduced SCN populations in soil under greenhouse and field conditions, but the nature and extent of this suppressive effect on SCN is not well understood. My research focused on investigating the nature of the Italian ryegrass x SCN interaction and the effectiveness of Italian ryegrass as a winter cover crop to suppress SCN and PDN. The first study was conducted in the greenhouse and consisted of a replacement pot experiment in which plant biomass and SCN reproduction was measured from pots containing various ratios of Italian ryegrass (IR) and PDN, +SCN. The second study was conducted at Waterman Agricultural and Natural Resourc...|$|E
