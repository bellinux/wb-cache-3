40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{obstacles to}} overcoming dangerous climate change. It employs {{an account of}} dangerous climate change that takes climate change and climate change policy as dangerous if it imposes avoidable costs of poverty prolongation. It then examines plausible accounts of the collective action problems that seem to explain the lack of ambition to mitigate. After criticizing the merits of two proposals to overcome these problems, it discusses the pledge and review process. It argues that pledge and review possesses the virtues of encouraging broad participation and of providing a <b>procedural</b> <b>safeguard</b> for the right of sustainable development. However, given {{the perceptions of the}} marginal short term costs of mitigation, pledge and review is unlikely, at least initially, to issue in an agreement to make deep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Because there is no rival approach that seems likely to better instantiate the two virtues, pledge and review may be the best available policy for mitigation. Moreover, recent economic research suggests that the co-benefits of mitigation may be greater than previously assumed and that the costs of renewable energy may be less than previously calculated. This would radically undermine claims that the short term mitigation costs necessarily render mitigation irrational and produce collective action problems. Given the circumstances, pledge and review might be our best hope to avoid dangerous climate change...|$|E
40|$|In {{a recent}} spate of highly publicized incidents, {{citizens}} have used cell phones equipped with video cameras to record violent arrests. Oftentimes they post their recordings on the Internet for public examination. As {{the courts have}} recognized, this behavior lies close {{to the heart of}} the First Amendment. But the Constitution imperfectly protects this new form of government monitoring. Fourth Amendment doctrine generally permits the warrantless seizure of cell phones used to record violent arrests, on the theory that the recording contains evidence of a crime. The Fourth Amendment inquiry does not evaluate a seizing officer 2 ̆ 7 s state of mind, permitting an official to seize a video for the very purpose of suppressing its contents. Moreover, Supreme Court precedent is typically read to ignore First Amendment interests implicated by searches and seizures. This result is perverse. Courts evaluating these seizures should stop to recall the Fourth Amendment 2 ̆ 7 s origins as a <b>procedural</b> <b>safeguard</b> for expressive interests. They should remember, too, the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s jurisprudence surrounding seizures of obscene materials—an area in which the Court carefully shaped Fourth Amendment doctrine to protect First Amendment values. Otherwise reasonable seizures can become unreasonable when they threaten free expression, and seizures of cell phones used to record violent arrests are of that stripe. Courts should therefore disallow this breed of seizure, trusting the political branches to craft a substitute procedure that will protect law-enforcement interests without doing violence to First Amendment freedoms...|$|E
40|$|The Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution provides: No person shall [...] . {{be subject}} {{for the same}} offense to be twice put in {{jeopardy}} of life or limb... If a refugee who has committed a deportable offense and served his sentence is subsequently deported from {{a place where he}} calls home to a place where he would face persecution, he could literally be said to have been twice put in jeopardy of life and limb. That seems to be a prima facie violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. This constitutional guarantee is, however, not currently available to refugees for a complex set of reasons. The most fundamental reason is that deportation is deemed to be a consequence of a civil proceeding that does not necessitate constitutional guarantees attending proceedings of a criminal nature. Although traditionally the Double Jeopardy Clause has been viewed as a <b>procedural</b> <b>safeguard</b> and a substantive limitation on criminal punishments, the constitutionality of second civil punitive sanctions has always been a subject of serious challenges. In recent decades, the Supreme Court has expressly addressed these challenges in a series of cases and consistently held that the Double Jeopardy Clause does impose substantive limitations on civil sanctions that are so punitive in nature to be considered second punishments. Deportation is generally considered to be a civil sanction. Notwithstanding the jurisprudential complexities involved, this article argues that the deportation of an already recognized refugee to a place where he might face persecution, pursuant to the statutory exclusion of convicted criminals, is a second punishment, and as such violates the Double Jeopardy Clause...|$|E

40|$|Chapter 6 of Research Handbook on Human Rights and Humanitarian Law In {{the wake}} of the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, the US, with the {{assistance}} of its coalition partners – all parties to various human rights instruments – initiated the so-called ‘war on terror’ by invading Afghanistan, where their armed forces killed or captured hundreds of ‘terrorist suspects’. Some of those detained were taken to the US military facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, while others have languished in US custody in Afghanistan. These actions raise the question whether a State is bound by its human rights obligations when its agents operate outside of national territory. And, if so, how do those obligations interrelate with the State’s other obligations under international humanitarian law when its counter-terrorism operations coincide with situations of armed conflict. This chapter addresses these questions. In particular, it examines the extraterritorial reach of two fundamental human rights during two situations recognized in international law. These rights are the right to life and the right to liberty and the related <b>procedural</b> <b>safeguard</b> of habeas corpus. The two situations examined are: (1) international armed conflicts, including occupation; and (2) non-international armed conflicts. The paper surveys the jurisprudence on the extraterritorial application of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the American Convention on Human Rights (American Convention) and American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man (American Declaration), and the European Convention on Human Rights (European Convention), {{and the extent to which}} rights in these instruments can be derogated from. It also examines how the treaty bodies supervising these instruments view the relationship between international human rights law (HRL) and international humanitarian law (IHL) in situations of armed conflict. Relevant decisions of the International Court of Justice are also referenced in this connection. The chapter also identifies certain gaps in legal protection. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|The classic debate {{surrounding}} the prolific {{role of the}} European Union in defining spheres of competence and power relationships has long divided scholarly opinion. However, in recent years, the long-standing acquiescence to the broad powers of the Union {{has given way to}} the emerging perception of a competence problem in Europe. For a long period it was taken for granted that the European Community could act whenever its action was justified {{on the basis of the}} widely interpreted objectives of the Treaties. However this context has since changed. There is a widespread perception of a competence problem in Europe and the overabundance of provisions limiting the Union's competences is one of the most obvious marks left by the Lisbon Treaty. This book discusses the extent to which the parameters of power throughout the Union and its Member States have been recast by the recent implementation of the Lisbon Treaty and doctrines developed by the European Court of Justice. Comprised of contributions from a vast array of leading practitioners and academics in the field of EU Law, this volume assesses the debate {{surrounding the}} political identity of the European Union, and further illustrates the relevance of the Federal theory of sharing competences for the development of EU Law. Finally, the question of new potential limits to Union's competence is addressed. If anything, this broad reflection on the notion of competence in the EU law context is a way of opening up the question of the nature and contours of the political identity of the European Union.

40|$|Appeal Boards {{serve as}} one {{mechanism}} for promoting administrative or social justice in public assistance. The Canada Assistance Plan (1966) required {{each of the}} provinces to establish welfare review tribunals and consequently each of the provinces and territories have Welfare Appeal Systems. The Canada Assistance Plan is the Federal Act that enables a province to receive reimbursement for one-half its annual expenditure on social welfare by entering into {{an agreement with the}} federal government. [...] This study was undertaken to specifically examine the Appeal process from the following perspectives: (1) the characteristics of the original decisions made by the social service employee that prompted the appeal; (2) the characteristics of the clients that decided to appeal; (3) the characteristics of the appeals and (4) the outcome of the appeals. [...] The review of the literature revealed that appeal systems have developed {{as an integral part of}} income-maintenance programs as a means to ensure that individuals receive their appropriate entitlement. The criticism of local agency practices reached its peak in 1970 with the United States Supreme Court's decision in Goldberg vs. Kelly, that AFDC recipients must be provided an opportunity to evidentiary hearings before termination of their benefits (O'Neil, cited in Hammer & Hartley, 1978). The relationship of legal representation on the outcome of appeals has been examined and while the findings indicate the need for Social Workers to be informed about the appeal procedures, it also found that petitioners without legal counsel were able to use the <b>procedural</b> <b>safeguard</b> of evidence presentation (Hagan, 1983). However, in order to utilize appeal opportunities more effectively, citizens must know that they exist and know the laws and regulations that constrain administrative practice. The need for expertise in pursuing grievances was also evident. [...] This descriptive study involves an examination of appeals for the entire province of Newfoundland and Labrador for the period April 1, 1983, to March 31, 1986. A total of 293 appeals were examined. Case files for each of the 293 cases were examined and the relevant data was coded and transferred to a master list for review and analysis. Interviews were also conducted with the three members who comprise the Appeal Board. [...] The findings revealed that the Appeal Board and employees have considerable discretion within the Social Assistance Act and Regulations and even within policy in making its decisions. The use of advocates to assist with the Appeal did not seem to have a significant overall difference on the outcome of the Appeal, however, the use of family relatives and legal aid lawyers did seem to positively impact upon the outcome of the hearing. [...] According to the members of the Appeal Board, there are a number of barriers to the appeal process for Social Assistance recipients.

40|$|The United States Supreme Court {{decision}} in Payne v. Tennessee, upholding {{the use of}} victim impact statements in capital jury sentencing proceedings, marked {{one of the most}} dramatic reversals of a precedent in the history of United States constitutional jurisprudence. The {{decision in}} Payne expressly overruled Booth v. Maryland decided only four years earlier. The Booth case rejected the use of victim impact statements in capital sentencing cases that involved juries. In Payne, the Supreme Court made it clear that victims were entitled to offer, and juries were permitted to consider, the effect that a 2 ̆ 2 death eligible 2 ̆ 2 homicide had on surviving relatives, even if the defendant was unaware of the impact he would cause at the time of the crime. The understandable desire of surviving relatives to participate in the criminal justice process, coupled with the perceived lack of balance which is said to occur when the victim is not permitted to address the jury, while members of the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s family are permitted to plead for the life of the defendant, contributed to the Court 2 ̆ 7 s abrupt departure from its earlier doctrine. In departing from Booth, however, the Supreme Court created a potential for uncertainty and confusion in capital jury sentencing that is likely to effect decisions by trial courts, prosecutors and defense attorneys for years to come. This article is an attempt to examine what has occurred in the Supreme Court regarding victim impact information. It will also explore what the future holds for courts attempting to set boundaries on the sentencing jury 2 ̆ 7 s consideration of such information. Finally, I will suggest some procedural safeguards that federal and state courts or legislatures concerned with capital cases should consider as they determine when it is appropriate to make this type of information part of its capital sentencing scheme. The Supreme Court has expressed its concern that a capital sentencing process should 2 ̆ 2 facilitate the responsible and reliable exercise of sentencing discretion. 2 ̆ 2 It has ruled that certain procedural safeguards must be put in place to make the procedure constitutional. However, by removing the bright line prohibition against victim impact information that the Supreme Court previously announced in Booth, it has allowed a potentially volatile category of evidence into capital cases without carefully explaining how it should be considered by a sentencing jury. State and federal law remains unclear as to how victim impact evidence is relevant to establish statutorily relevant aggravating circumstances or how it should be considered as a sentencing factor. Not only do uncertainties exist that concern the relevance of such information, but consideration of the confrontation problems presented by victim impact evidence have been largely unaddressed by the courts. Furthermore, legitimate questions arise regarding whether a defendant is entitled to any pre-trial disclosure of who the victims are, what they intend to present and how they intend to present their stories. This article advances the proposition that disclosure of victim impact information should be available at least in time for a capital defendant to consider his election of either a judge or a jury sentencing, where an election of the sentencer is available. I will first examine the short but turbulent reign of Booth 2 ̆ 7 s per se ban of victim impact information and Payne 2 ̆ 7 s dramatic and controversial reversal of Booth. Secondly, I will examine the history of victim participation in sentencing and the rise and influence of the modern 2 ̆ 2 victims rights 2 ̆ 2 movement on sentencing in general and capital sentencing in particular. Thirdly, I will examine the major criticisms of the use of victim impact information in capital sentencing, focusing particularly on the racial disparity that is likely to occur when the emphasis on capital sentencing is focused on the victim. Finally, I will offer some suggestions to improve the fairness in the use of victim impact information in capital cases for both defendants and victims. Hopefully, I will demonstrate why disclosure of victim impact evidence early in the capital case should be adopted as a threshold <b>procedural</b> <b>safeguard</b> if capital sentencing is to retain any integrity at all. The seriousness of capital jury sentencing, and the recognition that victim impact information is going to be a part of such sentencing in the foreseeable future, requires that serious attention be given to those matters left unaddressed by the Supreme Court. Lower courts will be required to resolve such concerns generated by the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s recent pronouncement on victim impact information in Payne and the uncharted course set by that precedent. It is certain that any court involved in the process of administering the death penalty must confront the difficult and recurring issues which are generated when a capital sentencing jury is asked to consider 2 ̆ 2 victim impact 2 ̆ 2 in the calculus of its 2 ̆ 2 life or death decision. 2 ̆...|$|E
