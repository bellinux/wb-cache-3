Still, taken as such, it is not without its luminosity. For a metaphor, by supplying us with a picturable representation, often enables us really to get at the hang of the thing a vast deal better than the most solemn argument. And I fancy communities sometimes pass through just such a chrysalis stage, when it seems to the timid and pessimistic in their midst as if every component element of the State (but especially the one in which they themselves and their friends are particularly interested) were rushing violently down a steep place to eternal perdition. Chaos appears to be swallowing up everything. [...] "The natural relations of classes" [...] disappear. Faiths melt; churches dissolve; morals fade; bonds fail; a universal magma of emancipated opinion seems {{to take the place of}} old-established dogma. The squires and the parsons of the period--call them scribes or augurs--wring their hands in despair, and cry aloud that they don't know what the world is coming to. But, after all, it is only the chrysalis stage of a new system. The old social order must grow disjointed and chaotic before the new social order can begin to evolve from it.

40|$|Vibrothermography is an NDE {{inspection}} {{which uses}} vibration to stimulate surface cracks {{and measure the}} resultant heat generation. For years, the accepted assumption has been that heat generation in Vibrothermography NDE is due to friction between opposing crack surfaces [1 – 3]. A frictional mechanism suggests that crack surfaces in sliding shear would generate heat, whereas crack surfaces coming {{into and out of}} contact in an opening-closing mode would not, or would generate much less. But cracks heat easily in opening/closing mode and experimental evidence [4] is not consistent with the prediction that heat generation for shear vibration should be substantially larger than heat generation for opening-closing mode. Perhaps friction is not the dominant heating mechanism or is not the entire story. Recent experiments [5 – 7] have led to several observations regarding the behavior of heat generation at cracks: i) a linear dependence on excitation frequency, ii) a dependence on excitation amplitude somewhere between linear and quadratic, iii) Crack heating occurs at or near the closure point where the crack transitions from closed (crack faces in contact) to open (crack faces not in contact) We revisit the controversy over the underlying mechanism of vibrothermographic crack heating, evaluating various alternative theories, including linear absorption, irreversible thermoelasticity, friction, adhesion hysteresis, and <b>plastic</b> flow for <b>consistency</b> with the experimental evidence.

40|$|In a {{cellular}} or PCS CDMA handset, power monitoring and gain control {{are provided by}} a Schottky detector diode in the transmit side of the unit. This detector diode must exhibit very good stability or consistency {{over a wide range}} of temperatures. Consistency in a Schottky diode can be defined in two ways: 1. Lot-to-lot consistency in key parameters, and 2. Diode-to-diode parameter match, over a wide temperature range, when two or more diodes are put into a single <b>plastic</b> package. Lot-to-lot <b>consistency</b> is important in order to insure good yields in the manufacture of certain high volume products such as cellular handsets. For example, variation in the junction capacitance or detection sensitivity of the diode used in the handset’s AGC circuit can result in handsets being out of spec when diodes from certain lots are used. Parameter match between two or four diodes in a single package is necessary in many applications.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{strategy}} to perform incremental elastoplastic analysis using the symmetric Galerkin boundary element method for multidomain type problems is shown. The discretization {{of the body is}} performed through substructures, distinguishing the bem-elements characterizing the so-called active macro-zones, where the <b>plastic</b> <b>consistency</b> condition may be violated, and the macro-elements having elastic behaviour only. Incremental analysis uses the well-known concept of self-equilibrium stress field here shown in a discrete form through the introduction of the influence matrix (self-stress matrix). The nonlinear analysis does not use updating of the elastic response inside each plastic loop, {{but at the end of}} the load increment only. This is possible by using the self-stress matrix, both, in the predictor phase, for computing the stress caused by the stored plastic strains, and, in the corrector phase, for solving a nonlinear global system, which provides the elastoplastic solution of the active macro-zones. The use of active macro-zones gives rise to a nonlocal and path-independent approach, which is characterized by a notable reduction of the number of plastic iterations.

40|$|The {{formulation}} of a generalized trapezoidal rule for {{the integration of}} the constitutive equations for a convex elastic-plastic solid is presented. This rule, which is based on an internal variable description, is consistent with a generalized trapezoidal rule for creep. It is shown that by suitable linear extrapolation, the standard backward difference algorithm can lead to this generalized trapezoidal rule or to a generalized midpoint rule. In either case, the generalized rules retain the symmetry of the consistent tangent modulus. It is also shown that the generalized trapezoidal and midpoint rules are fully equivalent {{in the sense that they}} lead to the establishment of the same minimum principle for the increment. The generalized trapezoidal rule thus inherits the notion of B-stability and both rules offer the opportunity to exploit the second order rate of convergence for a = ½. However, in the generalized trapezoidal rule, the equilibrium. and constitutive equations are fully satisfied at the end of the time increment. This may be more convenient than the generalized midpoint rule, in which equilibrium and <b>plastic</b> <b>consistency</b> are satisfied at the generalized midpoint. A backward difference return algorithm for piecewise linear yield surfaces is then formulated, with attention restricted to an associated flow rule and isotropic material behavior. Both the Tresca and Mohr-Coulomb yield surfaces with perfectly plastic and linear hardening rules are considered in detail. The algorithm has the advantage of being fully linked to the governing principles and avoids the inherent problems associated with corners on the yield surface. It is fully consistent in that no heuristic assumptions are made. The algorithm is extended to include the generalized trapezoidal rule in such a way that the general structure of the backward difference algorithm is maintained. This allows both for the computational advantages of the generalized trapezoidal rule to be utilized, and for a basis for comparison between this algorithm and existing backward difference algorithms to be established. Using this fully consistent algorithm, the return paths in stress space for the Tresca and Mohr-Coulomb yield surfaces with perfectly plastic and linear hardening rules are identified. These return paths thus provide a basis against which heuristically developed algorithms can be compared...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} was initiated to obtain some understanding on the behaviour of soil at higher moisture content {{and to explore}} the potential of preparing paddy fields with reduced amounts of water. This investigation comprised of three separate studies. Based on existing information that water could be reduced when soil clods were initially formed prior to flooding, the effects of clod size, clod initial moisture content and confining states on the rate of water uptake were explored. The moisture gradients within clods wetted and dried for different period of times were also studied. The results of the clod wetting experiments show that· the rate of water uptake by capillarity was greatest when clods were initially very dry and smaller clods tended to absorb water faster than bigger clods when under confined conditions. Confining {{had no effect on}} infiltration when the initial condition was very wet. On drying, the smallest clod dried the fastest, reduced greater volume and increased its dry bulk density significantly. Larger clods required,longer drying period to arrive at a uniform moisture profile within as compared to smaller clods. Results from the wetting experiments were tested against the infiltration model of. Jarvis and Leeds-Harrison (1987) and a model developed based on linear flow of heat into a solid (Carslaw and Jaeger, 1959). A second project involved the study of soil deformation at high moisture contents in an attempt to produce clods with minimum draught force using simple relieved tines at various rake angles and depths in a soil tank. The principal. objective of the - ii - study was to utilise soil implement mechanics knowledge to improve the efficiency of soil preparation for wetland crops. Aspects like the nature of soil disturbance, extent of disturbance and draught requirement were investigated. The soil was in a <b>plastic</b> <b>consistency</b> prepared to three specified density states of 940, 1000 and 1250 kg/m 3 • The soil disturbance pattern was monitored using implanted coloured beads and glass sided tank studies. In addition, the extent and height of heave and surface disturbance were noted. Predictive models based upon Mohr-Coulomb soil mechanics theory were developed to predict the interaction between the soil and simple implements at three rake angles. These were based on the lateral failure theory of Godwin and Spoor (1977) and the two dimensional soil failure model of Hettiaratchi and Reece (1974). Results from the single tine study were tested against the models. A sliding resistance component and crescent effect were incorporated to improve the predictions for the 45 ° and 90 ° rake angle tines. The magnitude of each mode of failure is dependent upon the critical aspect ratio which varies with tine rake angles and soil conditions. The mode of failure is considered to be lateral when the tine aspect ratio is larger than the critical aspect ratio and an upward failure when the tine aspect ratio is lower than the critical aspect ratio. The predicted results are in close agreement with the results of the experimental studies. For the backward raked tine, a model was developed based on the formation of an elliptical wedge and bearing capacity type of failure ahead and below the wedge. This failure theory was based on the bearing capacity failure for deep footings. The model - iii - helped identify an additional parameter that influenced the draught force for a backward raked tine. This parameter is the sliding resistance component on both sides and beneath the elliptical soil wedge •. Results from multitine studies showed that draught force increased with tine spacinq but the increase was not significant. In the wet condition the tines merely cut slots and little or no interaction was noted. In an effort to find the optimum water level for soil puddlinq, a laboratory study was conducted to determine the influence of water-soil ratio on the ease of puddling air dry aqqreqates. Soil puddlinq was carried out usinq a·rotary stirrer simulatinq the rotary motion of a rotary cultivator commonly used in wetland preparation •. The results obtained showed that· the fastest dispersion of particles resultinq in a minimum wet bulk density of 1. 23 Mg/m 3, was achieved at a water-soil ratio of 1. 2.

Üretilen betonlarda en büyük agrega boyutu, granülometri ve su/çimento oranı sabit tutularak agrega konsantrasyonu değiştirildi. Yarma deneyleri yardımıyla betonların şekil değiştirme kapasiteleri ölçüldü ve agrega konsantrasyonunun bu dolaylı çekme halindeki şekil değiştirme kapasitesine etkileri incelendi. Üretilen Bazalt serileri, Cebeci Kalkeri serileri, Dolomit serileri ve Beyaz Kalker serileri, % 0, % 20, % 40, % 60, % 75 agrega konsantrasyonularıyla üretildi. Agrega konsantrasyonu % 0 - % 75 arasaında değişirken, su/çimento oranı ve en büyük tane çapı sabit tutuldu. Su/çimento oranı 0, 28, en büyük agrega çapı 20 mm alındı. Bütün testlerde {{standart}} silindir ve küp numuneler kullanıldı. Silindir için yükseklik 300 mm, çap 150 mm; küp için 150 mm x 150 mm boyutlarına üretilen numunelere 28. günde yarma ve basınç deneyleri uygulandı. Yapılan deneylerde taze beton özellikleri, elastik ve elastik olmayan davranış özellikleri, gerilme – şekil değiştirme ilişkisi, ultrasonik ses hızının değişimi ve elastisite modülü araştırıldı.   Deneylerde ulaşılan sonuçlara göre, agrega konsantrasyonu artıkça taze betondaVe-Be değerinin arttığı çökmeninde azaltığı görülmüştür. Su/çimento oranı sabit tutulan deneylerde, agrega konsantrasyonunun artışıyla artan agrega yüzeyini ıslatmak için daha fazla suya ihtiyaç duyuldu.

Kırmataş agregalarının elastisite modülü hamur ve beton fazlarına göre yüksek olduğu için, kırmataş agrega konsantrasyonundaki artışın, betonun elastisite modülünü arttırdığı gözlendi. Agrega konsantrasyonundaki artışın süreksizlik sınırındaki Poisson oranını bir minimumdan geçtikten sonra arttığı görüldü. Aynı şekilde basınç dayanımı, çözülme sınırı ve süreksizlik sınırı değerlerinin de bir minimumdan geçtikten sonra arttığı gözlendi.   Yapılan ultra ses deneylerinde, ultra ses hızının agrega konstrasyonu arttıkça, arttığı görüldü.

I want in {{this study}} to establish the effect of aggregate volume ratio on concrete elastic and unelastic mechanical behavior. I will do so, by using four different types of aggregates and the affects of aggregate. These aggregates are Kırklareli region dolomite aggregates series, Cebeci region limestone aggregate series, white limestone aggregates series and Çorlu region basalt aggregate series. I will also point {{to the influence of}} aggregate concentration on the splitting tensile behavior and the strain capacity of concrete. I used a split tension test to measure the tensile strain capacity, {{due to the fact that}} an uniaxial tension test is difficult to perform. As a final statement, I experimentally measured the modulus of elasticity of concrete. Composite materials are the mixes of minimum two type of materials with different mecanical and chemical properties. These materials are coming together with contact surfaces. Contact surfaces are effecting the properties of concrete. New material has mostly different properties than the initial ones. Concrete is a heterogen and composite material. Also concrete shows elastic and inelastic features. I tried to see experimentals results in this inelastic phases. In the experiments, crack can be starts in contact surfaces, in cement paste or in aggregate. Cracks are phase of micro cracks till 60 % of compression strengt of concrete. Crack spread will start to make stable links till 80 %. Between 80 % - 95 % of compression strengt of concrete, crack spread will make unstable links. The concreates used in the experiments are belonging to five different aggregates volumes as follows: 0 %, 20 %, 40 %, 60 %, 75 % with basalt series (BA 20, BA 40, BA 60, BA 60, BA 75), cebeci limestone series (CE 20, CE 40, CE 60, CE 75), dolomite series (DO 20, DO 40, DO 60, DO 75), and white limestone (BE 00 a, BE 00 b, BE 20, BE 40, BE 60 a, BE 60 b, BE 75) series.   For this study i had to change the aggregate volume concentrations in the range of 0 % - 75 %, but i kept constant the aggregate grading of concrete, water/cement ratio and the maximum particle size for all concrete series. The water/cement ratio and the maximum size of aggregate were 0, 28 and 20 mm, respectively. I used 55 dm 3 concrete mixer. 60 % and 75 % aggregate concentration series prepared in steel formwork. I poured concrete in 3 step and each times I used steel bars 25 times for settle concrete. All concrete series are waited in formworks 24 hours. 28 days I kept them in pool with temperature 20 °C ± 2 °C. I made the experiments in 28 th day of concretes. All mechanical tests were based on the standard cylinder specimens, the height= 300 mm and the diameter= 150 mm and standard cube specimens 150 x 150 mm  at the age of 28 days.   Splitting tensile tests were based on disk specimens which were prepared from the standard cylinder as the height=l 50 mm and the diameter=l 50 mm. In the end, the test results that were made are evaluated in terms of following properties: Fresh concrete properties, elastic properties of concrete, inelastic properties of concrete, fracture energy, under compression, splitting tensile strength, tensile strain capacity, ultrasonic pulse velocity, the modulus of elasticity. I have split the investigations into four chapters: First chapter refers to general information. The second is the objective of the investigation. Third chapter is experimental studies and the results of these experiments. And the last chapter I put the conclusions of study and suggestions for further studies, if given. The results obtained in the experimental studies: Fresh concrete behaviour: Increasing of aggregate concentration is effecting workability of concrete negative. Concrete is passing from to dry concrete consistency. Composite is decreasing with increasing aggrega concentration. Ve-Be values are increasing slowly with increasing aggrega concentration till 60 % concentrate. We used superplasticizer in 60 % ans 75 % series. Because of that Ve-Be values decreasing in 60 % series. 75 % series is passing from <b>plastic</b> <b>consistency</b> to dry concrete consistency and value of Ve-Be is increasing rapidly. Results related to elastic behaviour: Aggregate concentration has an important effect on the modulus of elasticity, as an example when i chosen higher the modulus of elasticity of aggregate, the concrete increases also. Results related to inelastic behavior: The compressive strengths aggregates series decreases till one minimum limit and after that increases, when the aggregate volume concentration increases. The strains of all series at the maximum stress is decreasing as the aggregate volume concentration increases. Increasing of aggrega concentration is effects dislocation point of concrete. It is decreasing till one minimum point after that it is starting increase. Increasing of aggrega concentration is effects yielding point of concrete. It is decreasing till 35 % - 40 % concentration values after that it is starting increase. Compressive strength of concrete in DO, CE and BA series is decreasing till 35 % - 40 % aggregate concentrations, then it is increasing. BE series increasing continuously with increasing of aggrega concentration. The results related to the toughness and the relative toughness are as followed: as the aggregate volume concentrations of all concrete series increase the toughness of concretes decreases. The relative toughness of concrete series does not change much, as the aggregate volume concentration increases. Experimental results related to the splitting tensile strength and the tensile strain capacity: In normal aggregate concretes, as the aggregate volume in the mixes increases the splitting-tensile strength also increases. The tensile strain capacity is independent on the type and texture of aggregates within the limits of this work.   The tensile strain capacity as defined and measured in this work is strongly dependent on the volume of aggregate in the mix and it decreases with the increase of aggregate concentration. The results related to the ultrasonic pulse velocity: In all concrete series, as the aggregate volume concentration increases the ultrasonic pulse velocity also increases. Proposals for further studies: It can be performed with different origin of aggregates, at different ages than those chosen {{in this study}}, and different water/cement ratios other than 0, 28. We can also assume that issue can give more different results using a biaxial loading. By using different types of aggregates, the results obtained may vary in a wide range and line spacing must be set for summaries. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E
