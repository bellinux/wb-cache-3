40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>phyllosilicate</b> <b>minerals</b> on the {{flotation}} performance and froth stability of a copper ore was investigated. It {{was found that}} various <b>phyllosilicate</b> <b>minerals</b> affect the copper recovery differently however they all caused the flotation grade to be reduced. The effect of different <b>phyllosilicate</b> <b>minerals</b> on the froth stability followed the order of talc » montmorillonite > muscovite > kaolinite > illite. The results demonstrated {{that there could be}} a relationship between the deleterious effect of <b>phyllosilicate</b> <b>minerals</b> on the flotation and froth stability. Talc and montmorillonite have both shown the highest effect on the flotation recovery and grade as well as froth stability. On the other hand, illite has the least effect on the both flotation performance and froth stability. Kaolinite and muscovite also affected the copper flotation grade (but not the recovery) while they also affected the froth stability. Therefore it is possible to control the flotation performance when <b>phyllosilicate</b> <b>minerals</b> are present via monitoring and controlling froth stability which needs to be investigated further...|$|R

50|$|Montmorillonite is a {{subclass}} of smectite, a 2:1 <b>phyllosilicate</b> <b>mineral</b> {{characterized as}} having greater than 50% octahedral charge; its {{cation exchange capacity}} is due to isomorphous substitution of Mg for Al in the central alumina plane.
