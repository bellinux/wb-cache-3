50|$|Zincography is {{frequently}} confused with modern zinc-plate lithographic printing. It directly influenced {{the development of}} <b>photozincography,</b> an early form of photogravure.|$|E
50|$|Sir Henry, {{despite being}} {{the person who}} oversaw {{and set up the}} {{photography}} department, was not the actual inventor. The head of the photography department at Southampton, Captain A. de C. Scott, did much of the ground work and basic development on <b>photozincography.</b> Sir Henry did acknowledge the work of Scott in the development and use of the system in the introduction to the photozincographied Domesday Book. Despite this it was Sir Henry who gained most of the public attention through his pamphlet on <b>photozincography.</b> He was knighted in 1861 for services to science.|$|E
50|$|<b>Photozincography,</b> {{sometimes}} referred to as heliozincography but essentially the same process, known commercially as zinco, is the photographic process developed by Sir Henry James FRS (1803 - 1877) in the mid-nineteenth century.|$|E
50|$|In the 1860s {{the first}} {{facsimile}} of Domesday Book {{was created by}} the process of <b>photozincography</b> (later termed zinco), and was executed under the directorship of Henry James at the Southampton offices of the Ordnance Survey.|$|E
50|$|The {{general public}} were {{excited about the}} {{invention}} of <b>photozincography.</b> Newspapers such as the Photographic News reported on the events surrounding the invention and even supplied their readers with {{an example of a}} document which had undergone the process.|$|E
5000|$|Zinco or <b>photozincography</b> {{developed}} at the Ordnance Survey out of a need to reduce large-scale maps more effectively. The original method using a pantograph, was overcomplicated, time consuming and, due {{to the number of}} moving parts, inaccurate. While there was some concern that photography would distort the image, Sir Henry set out to explore the possibility of using photography, setting up a photography department at the Ordnance Survey in 1855 and also securing funds to build the [...] "glasshouse", a photography building with an all glass roof to allow as much natural light in as possible for photography. The development and discovery of <b>photozincography</b> or zinco came about four years later, being first mentioned in Sir Henry's report to Parliament in 1859.|$|E
5000|$|The use of <b>photozincography</b> at the Ordnance Survey {{was a great}} success, with Sir Henry {{claiming}} it saved over £2000 a year, from the invention of photo-zincography; the cost of producing a map of a rural district was reduced from 4 to 1 and maps of towns were reduced from 9 to 1. [...] It was also claimed that up to 2000 or 3000 impressions could be taken from a single plate. Despite this, the process was not perfect: it did not reproduce a full colour picture, and until 1875 boys were employed to colour in the maps produced by this method. The process, while better than the pantagraph, still required {{a large amount of}} labour to prepare the zinc plates for pressing. However, <b>photozincography</b> began to be used fairly rapidly in Europe. Sir Henry was even honoured by the Queen of Spain. Though originally developed to reproduce maps, the process was eventually to be used on a whole series of manuscripts, to preserve them and make them more available to the public. This included a reproduction of Domesday Book in 1861 - 64 and several volumes of historical manuscripts. Whilst the process of photo-zincography was invented mostly for use the Ordnance Survey, The Photographic News stated that the process could also be used in the Patent office and would save vast amounts of time and money. The use of <b>photozincography</b> began to decline in the 1880s as better methods of reproductions were made available and in the 1900s the glasshouse was pulled down to make way for new printing presses.|$|E
50|$|The main {{advantage}} and innovation {{of this process}} over lithography {{was the use of}} zinc plates rather than stone ones. Zinc plates were lighter and easier to transport, could produce more prints, and were far less brittle than the stone plates originally used. The use of zinc plates was also the origin of the name <b>photozincography,</b> which Sir Henry James claims to have invented.|$|E
50|$|A {{process camera}} is a {{specialised}} form of camera used for mass reproduction of graphic materials. The original document was photographed and the negatives (or positive films)produced {{were used to}} produce printing plates or other graphic media - usually via some kind of process where the negative was put in intimate contact with a printing plate in a vacuum frame(the printing plate having a U.V light-sensitive coating) and exposed to U.V. light. See offset lithography, silk screen printing, <b>Photozincography</b> and Heliozincography {{for more information on}} this process.|$|E
50|$|Unsuccessful as miners, Wenderoth and Nahl opened art studios, {{first in}} Sacramento {{and later in}} San Francisco, collaborating as painters, {{engravers}} and photographers. After a trip to South Seas and Australia, Wenderoth married and moved to Philadelphia, where he established a photography studio. In the late 1850s {{he worked for a}} period in South Carolina, going into partnership with Jesse Bolles. There, and later when he returned to Philadelphia, he innovated a number of photographic techniques, such as the ivory-type and <b>photozincography.</b> Wenderoth died in 1884 of tuberculosis.|$|E
5000|$|Major General Sir Henry James FRS MRIA RE (1803 - 1877) was the {{director-general}} of the Ordnance Survey, the British Government mapping agency, from 1854 to 1875. Sir Henry {{was described}} by the agency itself as [...] "perhaps Ordnance Survey's most eccentric and egotistical Director General". Sir Henry {{spent most of his}} life working for the Ordnance Survey and after becoming its head he introduced the new science of photography. He also would later claim to be the inventor of the process known as <b>Photozincography</b> or Zinco. Sir Henry also played a part in the resolving of the battle of the scales.|$|E
5000|$|On {{arrival at}} the Ordnance Survey offices in Southampton, Burtt {{expressed}} his satisfaction with the buildings' [...] "fireproof principles, and…military guard", and was given use of the best room in the building in which Domesday {{was placed in a}} fireproof safe, and the key entrusted to Burtt. Burtt’s description of the preparations extends to the actual photozincographic process, including James’s insistence that all plates should be developed and printed before the folios were returned. Nevertheless, the <b>photozincography</b> of Cornwall was completed in 11 days and Burtt returned to London. The process was carried out in the Ordnance Survey photography building nicknamed the glasshouse.|$|E
5000|$|Record type {{fell out}} of favour because its merits (primarily the fact that, given {{accurate}} transcription, the reader was presented with exactly what appeared on the manuscript page) were increasingly felt to be outweighed by its disadvantages: {{the high costs of}} typesetting and proofreading, and the challenges to the reader presented by a text prepared with minimal editorial intervention. Moreover, technical advances by the late 19th century meant that, in cases where there was a genuine argument for facsimile publication, this could be achieved more satisfactorily, cheaply and accurately by means of <b>photozincography</b> and other photographic printing techniques.|$|E
5000|$|Having {{completed}} Cornwall, James requested {{permission to}} photozincograph {{the rest of}} Domesday. Despite his claim that the public sale of the bound and engraved copies could cover the entire cost of the <b>photozincography</b> of the counties, The Lords of the Treasury wished to consult the Master of the Rolls regarding the comparison of James’s photozincographic reproductions with a rival process employed by Rev. Lambert Larking of Kent. Larking (a local antiquarian) had employed an artist to assist the reproduction of the county of Kent using the lithographic process - a much more expensive means of reproduction than <b>photozincography.</b> However, {{in order to secure}} this permission over Larking's process James had to provide the Treasury with evidence of public interest and a guarantee of low-cost production. Thomas Letts of Letts Son & Co. Limited, London distributed a circular nationally bearing a foreword from James encouraging subscription, and by late October more than fifty subscribers to each county had been amassed. On 28 November 1861 Burtt returned to Southampton once more with Domesday for the aforementioned counties’ photozincographing, and by December James had secured permission from the Treasury to copy the remainder of Great Domesday - but he was explicitly forbidden from reproducing Kent, in defence of Larking’s lithograph. By 1864 the facsimile of the entirety of Great Domesday had been completed, and had been published in 32 county volumes including Kent following Larking's death, who granted James permission to complete the reproduction of the county due to his infirmity {{in the final stages of}} his life.|$|E
50|$|James {{created a}} {{photography}} department to the Ordnance Survey in 1855 {{as a means}} of reducing the scale of maps. He claimed to have invented <b>photozincography,</b> a photographic method of producing printing plates. In fact, the process had been developed by two of his staff. However James was the driving force behind using the process to create and publish a facsimile of the Domesday Book in the 1860s. Sir Henry has been called, by T. Owen, one of the greatest image builders the Ordnance Survey ever had, because Sir Henry made all the advances he and his department made freely available. This was taken up by many foreign governments who were suitably impressed, the Queen of Spain making him a member of the royal order of Isabella the Catholic in 1863; which he added to his knighthood of 1860 for services to science.|$|E
50|$|Smith's {{mistrust of}} Parliament {{led to the}} {{establishment}} of the Parliamentary Remembrancer (1857-1865), a weekly journal which recorded the actions of Parliamentary sessions for the benefit of local authorities and the general public. However, the Remembrancer was also used to instruct. For example, Smith gave much space and enthusiasm to a project in 1861 to reproduce Domesday Book as individual counties using a new photographic process called <b>photozincography</b> under the supervision of Sir Henry James at the Ordnance Survey. In the Remembrancer Smith promoted Domesday Book as being the story of free Englishmen in a free England and expressed a desire that every man who cared about the well-being of his country should possess a copy and be familiar with its content. He actively encouraged subscribers and accused gentlemen who did not subscribe to the photo-zincographic Domesday of being unpatriotic and benighted.|$|E
50|$|After {{the first}} Ireland maps were {{published}} in the mid-1830s, the Tithe Commutation Act 1836 led to calls for a similar six-inch to the mile survey in England and Wales. Official procrastination followed, but the development of the railways added to pressure that resulted in the Ordnance Survey Act 1841. This granted a right to enter property for the purpose of the survey. Following a fire at its headquarters at the Tower of London in 1841 the Ordnance Survey relocated to a site in Southampton and was in disarray for several years, with arguments about which scales to use. Major-General Sir Henry James was by then Director General, and he saw how photography could be used to make maps of various scales cheaply and easily. He developed and exploited <b>photozincography,</b> not only to reduce the costs of map production but also to publish facsimiles of nationally important manuscripts. Between 1861 and 1864, a facsimile of the Domesday Book was issued, county by county; and a facsimile of the Gough Map was issued in 1870.|$|E
50|$|The early 20th century saw the {{development}} of <b>photozincography,</b> which allowed maps to be split into layers, for example one layer for vegetation and another for water. This was particularly used for printing contours - drawing these was a labour-intensive task but having them on a separate layer meant they could be worked on without the other layers to confuse the draughtsman. This work was originally drawn on glass plates but later plastic film was introduced, with the advantages of being lighter, using less storage space and being less brittle, among others. When all the layers were finished, they were combined into one image using a large process camera. Once color printing came in, the layers idea was also used for creating separate printing plates for each color. While the use of layers much later {{became one of the}} main typical features of a contemporary GIS, the photographic process just described is not considered to be a GIS in itself - as the maps were just images with no database to link them to.|$|E
50|$|In May 1866 Waterhouse was {{appointed}} Assistant Surveyor {{in charge of}} the photozincographic operations of the Survey of India and after undergoing training at Dehradun in the use of <b>photozincography</b> for the reproduction of maps and plans, he arrived in Calcutta in December 1866 to take up his new post. The remaining thirty years of his career were to be spent in supervising the photographic operations of the Calcutta headquarters, overseeing a dramatic growth in the department's output and activities, from a minor and ill-housed offshoot of the Survey of India to one of its most important departments, housed in the impressive quarters which survive to the present day in Wood Street. As well as printing maps and plans, the Photolithographic Department of the Survey undertook a wide range of additional photographic activities under Waterhouse's direction, including the copying of the sketches made by Edward Law Durand {{in the course of his}} work with the Afghan Boundary Commission of 1884-87, the producing of presentation albums for the Viceroy relating to the Gilgit Mission of 1888 and the reproduction of photographs made by the Archaeological Survey of India.|$|E
