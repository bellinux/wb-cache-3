40|$|Background: This {{retrospective}} {{study examined the}} effectiveness and safety of <b>polygeline</b> in adult patients with hypovolemia due to traumatic injury. Materials and Methods: <b>Polygeline</b> was administered after evaluating the amount of blood loss and estimating hematological and biochemical parameters. Changes in vital signs, serum electrolytes, arterial pH, and serum lactate were evaluated. The safety was evaluated by recording the adverse events if any. Results: Sixty patients with the mean age 37. 5 ± 11. 26 years {{were included in the}} study. All patients had blood loss < 20 %. The mean total <b>polygeline</b> administered was 1025. 0 ± 464. 18 ml. Blood transfusion was required in 3. 33 % of patients. Diastolic, systolic, and mean arterial blood pressure and pulse rate significantly increased after 1 h of <b>polygeline</b> administration (P < 0. 0001). There was a trend toward increase in urine output (P = 0. 0715) after 1 h. The improvement in vital parameters was consistent at 6, 14, and 18 h after administration of <b>polygeline.</b> Arterial pH significantly increased from 7. 2 ± 0. 12 to 7. 3 ± 0. 11 after 1 h of administration (P < 0. 0001) and was consistent till 24 h (P = 0. 035). Blood lactate decreased after 1 h (P < 0. 0001). Changes in laboratory parameters were not clinically significant. After mean duration hospital stay of 10. 5 ± 4. 63 days all patients were discharged without any clinically significant abnormality or adverse event. Conclusion: <b>Polygeline</b> improved hemodynamic stability in patients with hypovolemia due to traumatic injury. The improvement was seen within 1 h (golden hour) of <b>polygeline</b> administration and maintained consistently. <b>Polygeline</b> can be safely administered to patients with traumatic injury to improve hemodynamic parameters and achieve stability...|$|E
40|$|Post dural {{puncture}} headache (PDPH) {{may cause}} morbidity in women undergoing caesarean section with spinal anesthesia. PDPH {{is caused by}} a reduction of intrathecal pressure due to leakage of cerebrospinal fluid. <b>Polygeline</b> bolus into the epidural space is expected to temporarily increase the pressure of the epidural space therefore reduces cerebrospinal fluid leakage so that it may reduce the incidence of PDPH. The study conducted was a single-blind randomized clinical trial on 90 pregnant women undergoing caesarean section with spinal anesthesia from October until December 2011 in Dr. Hasan Sadikin Hospital Bandung. Samples were randomly divided into the bolus of 7. 5 mL <b>polygeline</b> group and the control group. Evaluation of PDPH was performed until 5 th day post-spinal anesthesia. Statistical analysis using Fisher's Exact Test, showed that the incidence of PDPH in both treatment groups showed a statistically significant difference (p< 0. 05). The conclusion of this study is <b>polygeline</b> bolus into the epidural space may decrease the incidence of PDPH in patients undergoing caesarean section with spinal anesthesia...|$|E

Abstract BACKGROUND &# 38; AIMS: Paracentesis associated with plasma expanders {{is widely used}} {{for the treatment of}} ascites in cirrhosis. This study investigated the clinical importance of paracentesis-induced-circulatory dysfunction and compared the efficacy of albumin, dextran 70, and <b>polygeline</b> in preventing this complication. METHODS: A total of 289 cirrhotic patients with ascites were randomized to treatment by total paracentesis plus intravenous albumin (97 patients), dextran 70 (93 patients), or <b>polygeline</b> (99 patients). Postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction was defined as an increase in plasma renin activity on the sixth day after paracentesis of more than 50...|$|E
40|$|In {{the use of}} {{low-level}} intravenous insulin infusion {{for treating}} diabetic hyperglycaemia and ketoacidosis adsorption of insulin to containers or plastic infusion apparatus results in significant losses of 60 - 80 % of insulin in dilute physiological saline solution (40 U/l). It is therefore necessary to add protein to the carrier solution to minimize losses and maintain a constant delivery rate. Recovery studies showed that 3. 5 % w/v <b>polygeline</b> solution (polymer of degraded gelatin) was a suitable medium for this purpose, offering some advantages over human serum albumin. A minimum concentration of 0. 5 % <b>polygeline</b> was required to ensure adequate delivery of insulin to the patient...|$|E
40|$|To {{demonstrate}} {{the efficacy of}} a premedication with H 1 - + H 2 -receptor antagonists against histamine-release responses in anaesthesia and surgery 3 randomized controlled trials were conducted in patients, volunteers and experimental animals (dogs). Cutaneous anaphylactoid reactions following infusion of <b>polygeline</b> (Haemaccel) in orthopedic patients were successfully abolished by premedication with 0. 1 mg/kg dimethpyrindene (Fenistil) and 5 mg/kg cimetidine (Tagamet). Chlorpheniramine (Piriton) was also useful, but dimethpyrindene was more effective in the doses recommended and used. Side-effects of the premedication were not observed when the 2 drugs were slowly administered (2 min each). Systemic anaphylactoid reactions following infusion of <b>polygeline</b> were completely prevented in volunteers by the same premedication (0. 1 mg/kg dimethpyrindene and 10 mg/kg cimetidine). Life-threatening reactions could not be tested in human subjects, but were elicited in experimental animals (dogs). In this species which resembles man in its sensitivity against histamine, in plasma histamine levels {{and in response to}} <b>polygeline</b> life-threatening reactions were prevented or in especially severe cases diminished to such an extent by the premedication with H 1 - + H 2 -blockers that this premedication was finally judged to be very effective against histamine-release responses of any grade of severity. To confirm this clinically very important hypothesis more clinical trials in patients at risk for anaphylactoid reactions to drugs are urgently needed...|$|E
40|$|Objectives:To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), dextran 70 and their combination on platelet adhesion and fibrinogen uptake in ePTFE grafts in an experimental sheep model. Design:Prospective open study. Setting:Animal Laboratory of a University Hospital. Materials:Early thrombogenicity of ePTFE grafts was studied after interposition in the two common carotid arteries of 40 adult sheep. The animals received one of four different treatment regimens in a double blind randomised way: enoxaparin and <b>polygeline,</b> saline and dextran 70, enoxaparin and dextran 70 or saline and <b>polygeline</b> (control). The substances were administered i. v. with a total dose of 73 antifactor-Xa U/kg for enoxaparin and 1. 0 g/kg for dextran 70. <b>Polygeline</b> and saline were used as placebo substances in equivalent volumes. On one side (random allocation) the carotid blood flow was restricted to 25 ml/min, {{on the other side}} it was left unrestricted. Chief outcome measures:The following variables were studied: 1) fibrinogen uptake; 2) platelet uptake; 3) early graft patency; 4) blood flow in patent grafts; 5) visible presence of graft thrombus; 6) thrombus weight. Main results:The results verified the importance of adequate blood flow as only 30 % of grafts with restricted blood flow in the control group were patent compared with 80 % of those with unrestricted blood flow (p = 0. 038). Dextran 70, enoxaparin and the combination of the two increased early graft patency (p < 0. 05) and reduced thrombus weights (p < 0. 05) in grafts with restricted blood flow. The relative number of grafts with thrombus free surface was increased in the unrestricted blood flow situation. Conclusions:Dextran 70 and enoxaparin appeared to be equally effective in decreasing fibrinogen and platelet uptake in the grafts. Their combination was not significantly more effective although there was a favourable trend...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} whether an impairment of the haemostasis could be observed experimentally when thromboprophylactic substances, which act differently on the haemostatic mechanism, were given single or in combination in prophylactic doses. In 36 rabbits we measured the primary haemostatic plug formation time (PHT), rebleedings and total haemostatic plug formation time (THT) after transection of venules and arterioles using an intravital microscope. We combined unfractionated heparin (UH) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in low dose with either dextran 70 or <b>polygeline</b> (placebo volume expander) in a randomized double-dummy set up. In the placebo group (NaCl and <b>polygeline)</b> the median PHT was 55 and 101 seconds for arterioles and venules respectively, which are well-comparable to earlier results from our group. Most prolonged PHT and THT for arterioles were seen for dextran+NaCl, actually less prolongation was seen for UH+dextran. We did not observe any differences, except for a prolongation of THT for venules in rabbits given dextran+NaCl (p less than 0. 05). Thus, in thromboprophylactic doses used, there does not seem to be an impaired or additive effect between heparins and dextran 70 in primary haemostasis in rabbits...|$|E
40|$|Colloid infusions {{can cause}} {{metabolic}} acidosis. Mechanisms and relative severity with different colloids are incompletely understood. We compared haemodilution acid-base effects of 4 % albumin, 3. 5 % <b>polygeline,</b> 4 % succinylated gelatin (all weak acid colloids, strong ion difference 12 mEq/l, 17. 6 mEq/l and 34 mEq/l respectively), 6 % hetastarch (non-weak acid colloid, strong ion difference zero) and 0. 9 % saline (crystalloid, strong ion difference zero). Gelatin weak acid properties were tracked via the strong ion gap. Four-step ex vivo dilutions of pre-oxygenated human venous blood {{were performed to}} a final [Hb] near 50 % baseline. With each fluid, base excess fell to approximately - 13 mEq/l. Base excess/[Hb] relationships across dilution were linear and direct (R 2 ≥ 0. 96), slopes and intercepts closely resembling saline. Baseline strong ion gap was - 0. 3 (2. 1) mEq/l. Post-dilution increases occurred in three groups: small with saline, hetastarch and albumin (to 3. 5 (02) mEq/l, 4. 3 (0. 3) mEq/l, 3. 3 (1. 4) mEq/l respectively), intermediate with <b>polygeline</b> (to 12. 2 (0. 9) mEq/l) and greatest with succinylated gelatin (to 20. 8 (1. 4) mEq/l). We conclude that, despite colloid weak acid activity ranging from zero (hydroxyethyl starch) to {{greater than that of}} albumin with both gelatin preparations, ex vivo dilution causes a metabolic acidosis of identical severity to saline in each case. This uniformity reflects modifications to the albumin and gelatin saline vehicles, in part aimed at pH correction. By proportionally increasing the strong ion difference, these modifications counter deviations from pure saline effects caused by colloid weak acid activity. Extrapolation in vivo requires further investigation...|$|E
40|$|Eleven open-chest piglets {{were studied}} {{to examine the}} effects of {{vascular}} engorgement on partitioned airway and lung tissue mechanics, and to investigate the role of vagal denervation on lung function during engorgement. Alveolar pressure was measured using alveolar capsules. Pulmonary elastance (EL) and resistance (RL), airway (R(aw)), and tissue (V(ti)) resistance were calculated during mechanical ventilation. Acute fluid administration with <b>polygeline</b> (10 mL/kg boluses up to a total of 30 mL/kg) resulted in an increase of RL with increases in both R(aw) and V(ti). V(ti) rose 2 - 3 -fold in comparison with R(aw). To increase left atrial pressure; a balloon catheter was inserted into the left atrium of the heart and inflated with different volumes. The responses of EL, RL, R(aw) and V(ti) were comparable to those with acute fluid load. Alterations in pulmonary mechanics were closely correlated to mean pulmonary artery blood pressure. In another six animals the effect of vagotomy on vascular engorgement was studied. Vagotomy did not alter baseline airway or tissue mechanics. Furthermore, vagotomy did not influence the change of pulmonary mechanics to fluid load or increase of left atrial pressure. Our data indicate that in young piglets vascular engorgement causes alterations in airway and lung tissue mechanics that are not dependent on vagal influences...|$|E
40|$|Background: Carbon dioxide (CO 2) {{embolism}} is {{a possible}} complication of capnoperitoneum during laparoscopic surgery. Experimentally induced venous CO 2 embolism has been studied in pigs. In this paper we report a case of spontaneous CO 2 embolism. Observations: A 4 -month-old Large White pig weighing 20 kg underwent experimental laparoscopic surgery under general anaesthesia. Monitoring consisted of pulse oximetry, capnography, airway pressure, electrocardiography, invasive arterial and central venous blood pressures, and arterial blood-gas analysis. Shortly {{after the start of}} laparoscopy and onset of CO 2 insufflation, sudden decreases in end-tidal CO 2 (Pe′CO 2), haemoglobin saturation of oxygen (SpO 2), systolic arterial blood pressure and heart rate were observed. Airway pressure increased and pulmonary compliance decreased simultaneously. Insufflation was immediately discontinued and epinephrine (2 mg IV), atropine (0. 5 mg IV) and a 50 mL bolus of a <b>polygeline</b> solution were administered without effect. At this time arterial blood-gas analysis revealed a pH of 7. 29 and a PaCO 2 of 6. 8 kPa (51. 2 mmHg); PaO 2 was 26. 6 kPa (199. 5 mmHg). After 4 minutes asystole occurred. Conclusions: The sudden decrease of Pe′CO 2 and lung compliance combined with the sudden decrease in systolic blood pressure, heart rate and a poor response to resuscitation suggest a case of fatal gaseous venous embolism...|$|E
40|$|Neuropeptide Y, a major {{hypothalamic}} peptide, stimulates feeding, insulin secretion {{and weight}} gain when injected intrahypothalamically. Hypothalamic NPY may be regulated by insulin availability at hypothalamic level, as its activity is apparently inhibited by intrahypothalamic insulin administration and is stimulated under insulin-deficient conditions. To {{determine the effects}} of acute physiological hyperinsulinemia, we measured regional hypothalamic NPY levels in rats during a hyperinsulinemic, euglycemic clamp. Seven male Wistar rats with implanted jugular cannulae, fasted for 24 h, were infused with insulin at 100 mU/h together with variable-rate glucose to maintain euglycemia (3. 9 ± 0. 1 mmmol/l), for 150 min. Controls were infused for the same period with <b>polygeline</b> vehicle alone (n= 8), and had blood glucose concentrations of 4. 0 ± 0. 5 mmol/l. Insulin levels were 80. 2 ± 3. 9 mU/l in insulin-infused rats and 15. 2 ± 1. 4 mU/l in polygeline-treated controls (p< 0. 001). NPY levels, measured by radioimmunoassay, were significantly higher in the arcuate nucleus/median eminence (ARC/ME) of hyperinsulinemic rats than in controls (4. 8 ± 1. 2 vs 2. 5 ± 0. 6 fmol/μg protein; p< 0. 001), but were comparable with controls in 7 other hypothalamic regions. Acute physiological hyperinsulinemia therefore increases NPY levels selectively in the ARC/ME. Insulin could cause NPY accumulation in the ARC by blocking its transport to NPY-sensitive areas. This would be consistent with the suggestions that insulin inhibits hypothalamic NPY activity and also acts as a central satiety factor...|$|E
40|$|Carboxylmethylated {{konjac glucomannan}} (CKGM) is a carboxylmethylated polymer of mannose and glucose that {{is derived from}} the plant Amorphophallus konjac {{cultivated}} in East Asia. The CKGM solution had a high volume-expanding efficacy and was evaluated as a plasma substitute in the present study. Ameliorative hemorrhagic shock rabbits were used as the model animals. The in vivo hemodynamic and hemorheologic properties, including blood pressure, blood viscosity, hematocrit, erythrocyte deformation index and erythrocyte aggregation index, were measured in animals treated in the CKGM solution. The in vitro colloid osmotic pressure (COP) of the CKGM solution was measured to estimate its plasma-expanding efficacy. These parameters of the CKGM-treated group were compared with groups exposed to four other treatments: human serum albumin (HSA), hydroxyethyl starch (HES), <b>polygeline</b> and normal saline. The CKGM solution showed an exceptionally higher COP than other therapy solutions. For example, the COP of 1 % (weight in volume [w/v]) CKGM solution is comparable to those of 6 % (w/v) HES solution and 5 % (w/v) HSA solution. Accordingly, the CKGM solution can be transfused in a much lower dosage while maintaining its plasma-expanding efficacy. The CKGM-treated group showed an improved intravascular persistence and good hemodynamic and hemorheological properties. Biopsy analysis suggested no organ dysfunction in the group treated in CKGM solution. Moreover, the high plasma-expanding efficacy and inexpensive availability of the CKGM solution may facilitate its clinical application as a potential plasma substitute...|$|E
40|$|New tissue {{substitute}} materials {{known as}} Cross-linked Hydrophilic Copolymers {{have been investigated}} {{in order to determine}} their suitability as phantoms for mammography applications. The main requirement of a radiation phantom is that the radiation interactions within the phantom should match those interactions that would take place in the simulated body organ or tissue. The potential of cross-linked hydrophilic copolymers, as tissue substitute materials, in simulating the photon attenuation and scattering responses of human soft tissues has been evaluated. The cross-linked hydrophilic copolymers used in this study, designated as ED IS and ED 4 C, were based upon a combination of polyvinylpyrrolidone: methyl methacrylate and are able to take up a controllable amount of water without being dissolved in it. The hydrophilic materials in dry and hydrated states have been irradiated in order to estimate their mass and linear photon attenuation coefficients. The materials were hydrated in double distilled water and various solutions of sodium hydroxide (NaOH), hydrochloride (HCl) and copper sulphate (CUSO 4) as well as plasma tissue substitute material known as HaemaccelRTM (<b>Polygeline).</b> The effect of the pH value of the absorbent on the linear expansion of the hydrophilic materials was investigated. Moreover, the attenuation properties of the hydrophilic materials were verified at a range of hydration levels where double distilled water was used as an absorbent. The XCOM computer code was used to calculate the mass photon attenuation coefficients of the hydrophilic materials and the results were compared to the measured values. Furthermore, the electron densities of the cross-linked hydrophilic copolymers were determined. Normal and pathological breast tissue samples (adipose, glandular and tumour) excised from nine postmenopausal breast cancer patients undergoing mastectomies were collected from the Histopathology Department at the Royal Surrey County Hospital as fresh and blood free samples. The linear photon attenuation coefficients and the electron densities of the breast tissue samples were independently measured and compared to both the hydrophilic materials and the published data for breast tissues. The breast tissue samples were examined after freeze drying and the results were corrected for the water reduction by the use of the Mixture Rule. The water content of each tissue type was determined as the weight lost during the freeze during process. The technique of Photon Transmission Tomography (PTT) was used to measure the linear attenuation coefficients of the materials and the tissue samples whereas their electron densities were determined by the employment of the technique of Compton Scattering Densitometry (CSD). For both the PTT and CSD techniques, an encapsulated americium- 241 radiation source of photons of energy 59. 50 keV and a high purity germanium (HPGe) detector were used. Chemical substances of known mass and linear photon attenuation coefficients and electron densities were employed in order to investigate the performance of the PTT and CSD systems...|$|E
