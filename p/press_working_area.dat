50|$|Working area: Working {{area is the}} plastically {{deforming}} {{area for}} drawing materials. Length and cone angle are the two factors for the working performance of this <b>area.</b> If the <b>working</b> <b>area</b> is too short, excessive pressure to the <b>working</b> <b>area</b> will be generated by the metal stretched. For the above reason, the tensile stress increased significantly, resulting in the accelerated wear of the mold. The principles for {{the selection of the}} length of the <b>working</b> <b>area</b> are as follows: a. The <b>working</b> <b>area</b> used for stretching soft metal wire is shorter than the <b>working</b> <b>area</b> used for stretching hard metal wire; b. The <b>working</b> <b>area</b> used for stretching metal wire with small diameter is shorter than the <b>working</b> <b>area</b> used for stretching metal wire with a large diameter; c.The <b>working</b> <b>area</b> worked under the condition of wet lubrication is shorter than the <b>working</b> <b>area</b> worked under the condition of dry lubrication. As for the taper angle, the taper angle is smaller when stretching steel, while the cone angle should be larger when stretching non-ferrous metals and its alloys.|$|R

40|$|The {{competition}} in the world market for iron ore has increased lately. Therefore, an improved method of estimating the ore quality in small <b>working</b> <b>areas</b> has become an attractive cost-cutting strategy in short-term mine plans. Estimated grades of different <b>working</b> <b>areas</b> of a mine {{form the basis of}} any short-term mine plan. The generally sparse exploration data obtained during the development phase is not enough to accurately estimate the grades of small <b>working</b> <b>areas.</b> Therefore, additional sample information is often required in any operating mine. The findings of this case study show that better utilization of all available exploration information at this mine would improve estimation of small <b>working</b> <b>areas</b> even without additional face samples. Through the use of kriging variance, this study also determined the optimum face sampling grid, whose spacing turned out to be approximately 100 meters as compared to 50 meters in use today.

40|$|Abstract—Cell {{enumeration}} and diagnosis using {{peripheral blood}} smears are routine tasks in many biological and patho-logical examinations. Not every {{area in the}} smear is appropriate for such tasks due to severe cell clumping or sparsity. Manual <b>working</b> <b>area</b> selection is slow, subjective, inconsistent and statistically biased. Automatic <b>working</b> <b>area</b> classification can reproducibly identify appropriate <b>working</b> smear <b>areas.</b> However, very {{little research has been}} reported in the literature. With the aim of providing a preprocessing step for further detailed cell enumeration and diagnosis for high throughput screening, we propose an integrated algorithm for area classification and quantify both cell spreading and cell clumping in terms of individual clumps and the occurrence probabilities of the group of clumps over the image. Comprehensive comparisons are presented to compare the effect of these quantifications and their combinations. Our experiments using images of Giemsa-stained blood smears show that the method is efficient, accurate (above 88. 9 % hit rates for all areas in the validation set of 140 images) and robust (above 78. 1 % hit rates for a test set of 4878 images). This lays a good foundation for fast <b>working</b> <b>area</b> selection in high throughput screening.
