40|$|The {{thesis on}} the topic Analysis of Faults Found in Fire Inspections Performed within Execution of State Fire Inspection by the Fire Brigade Rescue Corps of Southern Bohemia in 2003 2012 focuses on {{comparison}} of faults selected by gradual elimination from all the 700 fire inspections to final 150 complex fire inspections and classified per years in a ten-year comparison period. Follow-up inspections and thematic fire inspection were not used for the complex evaluation as they did not contain the necessary information. Six parameters were chosen from all the performed complex inspections containing 30 monitored facts of correctness and existence of documents of the inspected object and seven monitored facts from physical examination of the objects. These six parameters were subsequently compared. The aim of my thesis was {{to find out whether}} the numbers of the faults detected within execution of the state fire inspection were increasing in the individual categories. The theoretical part summarizes the basic legal norms applicable to the Fire Brigade Rescue Corps of the CR and to execution of the state fire inspection and some extensive legal norms related to the inspection activities or inspected subjects. Elaboration of the thesis topic required explanation of some terms like legal entity, private entrepreneur, fire inspection, state fire inspection and its integration in the Fire Brigade Rescue Corps of the CR. The chapter contains description of activities including graphs illustrating procedures related to execution of state fire inspection. A separate part is dedicated to fire protection history, formation of awareness of the history and to chronological arrangement of some key legal norms binding for the Fire Brigade Rescue Corps of the CR and execution of state fire inspection. It was for example necessary to present the rules governing execution of state fire inspection like professional competence of Fire Brigade Rescue Corps members and their identification at the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspection,</b> to clarify the terms fire inspection plan and fire inspection programme. The final part of the theoretical base of the thesis contains the rules of behaviour of Fire Brigade Rescue Corps members performing state fire inspection at the inspected site and principles of interaction with people representing the inspected subject. The research methodology was chosen adequately to the topic dealt with. First archive materials from complex fire inspection records were studied and then the individual faults were qualitatively processed and categorized to faults in documentary part and physical defects. After that a selection of closer spectre of examined faults was performed and preparation of data for comparison. The faults of the individual years were compared in the monitored data and the danger index of the individual years was calculated. The concluding part of the thesis focused on presentation of the dependences of the detected faults of the individual years by means of tables and graphs. The results were mutually compared, classified, commented in detail in the discussion and elaborated into the overall image of the society. Dependence of the number of performed complex fire inspections on the number of detected faults was proven from the danger index and from graphic representation of its values...|$|E

40|$|The {{quality of}} many goods and {{services}} may change randomly between the time of shipment and delivery, creating disputes over quality that can result in lemons-market equilibria. We investigate the potential <b>of</b> third-party <b>inspections</b> for such inefficiencies. We consider two types <b>of</b> <b>inspection,</b> ex post verification of quality in consignment contracts and ex ante certification in FOB contracts, which were instituted for fruits and vegetables in the U.

Buyers prefer ex post verification to ex ante certification while sellers prefer the reverse. Government provision <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> services may be necessary for making provision <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> services economically viable, and may be desirable for reducing inefficiencies due to the costliness <b>of</b> <b>inspection.</b> The U.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} novel {{treatment}} of the inspection-system design problem when inspection is unreliable and subject to classification errors. Our approach, based on the theory of Error-Correcting Codes (ECC), leads to the development <b>of</b> a Self-Correcting <b>Inspection</b> (SCI) decision rule that does not require complete knowledge <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> error probabilities. We show that the proposed rule assures correct classification, if the number <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> errors {{is less than a}} certain number. We analyze the performance of the SCI decision rule under different inspection situations, including some situations that are uncommon in the field of error-correcting codes. Then, we show how the underlying mathematical structure can be applied to determine the number <b>of</b> <b>inspections</b> and the level <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> reliability in order to minimize the sum of inspection-related costs. The practical contribution of this work lies in that it expands the ability of the designer <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> systems to deal with cases where there is very little or no information regarding the reliability <b>of</b> the <b>inspection</b> operations. 1.

40|$|Inspection {{has been}} an {{increasingly}} important feature of central monitoring {{of education in the}} 1990 s. This article examines the technical reliability <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> processes in initial teacher training, drawing extensively on methodology and procedures adopted by the Office for Standards in Education (OFSTED) between 1996 and 1998. A definition of reliability is advanced and tested against the procedures <b>of</b> <b>inspection,</b> especially by examining the security of internal and external judgements at the pass/fail borderline and the moderation and training procedures deployed by OFSTED. The methodology <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> is found to be insufficiently reliable for the consequences which flow from it. Tensions are explored between the technicist model <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> underlying OFSTED initial teacher training procedures and the 'informed conoisseurship' model hitherto deployed by members of Her Majesty's Inspectorate. In consequence, there are unresolved tensions between the expressed aspiration for 'improvement through inspection' and the use <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> to police compliance...|$|R

40|$|Failures in FRP-strengthened {{reinforced}} concrete (RC) members may occur by flexural failures of critical sections or by debonding of FRP plate from the RC beams. Debonding in the FRP/adhesive/concrete interface region may cause {{a significant decrease}} in member capacity leading to a premature failure of the system. There is a need for improved knowledge of the debonding processes under mechanical and environmental effects. In addition, it is essential to develop appropriate nondestructive evaluation techniques for the <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> these systems for safe application of strengthening concrete structures using FRP composites. In {{the first part of this}} paper, various debonding modes are discussed and modeling techniques are introduced.
