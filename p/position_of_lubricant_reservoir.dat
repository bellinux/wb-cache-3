40|$|The {{aim of this}} diploma {{thesis is}} to {{describe}} mechanisms involved in a lubricant film formation in textured conformal contacts. For exploring <b>of</b> the <b>lubricant</b> film formation, the method of optical interferometry is implemented on a pin-on-disc tribometer. That allows to study an influence of a texture on lubricant film thickness and coefficient of friction of textured samples. These samples have different parameters of a texture. On {{the basis of these}} effects and the visual image of the contact, the flow <b>of</b> <b>lubricant</b> in the contact area is described. Shallow dimples lead to larger film thickness in elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication regime. They act like a <b>lubricant</b> <b>reservoir.</b> Deep dimples positively affect film thickness in hydrodynamic lubrication regime, where the effect of shallow dimples descend. During experiments, the formation of a cavitation is observed. The cavitation causes a starvation of dimples in many cases. This leads to reducing <b>of</b> the <b>lubricant</b> film thickness. This effect can be eliminated by appropriate parameters of texture in operational conditions of elements...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, we {{describe}} possible solutions for a stationary flow of two superposed fluids between two close surfaces in relative motion. Physically, {{this study is}} within the lubrication framework, {{in which it is}} of interest to predict the relative <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> the <b>lubricant</b> and the air in the device. Mathematically, we observe that this problem corresponds to finding the interface between the two fluids, and we prove that it is equivalent to solve some polynomial equation. We solve this equation using an original method of polynomial resolution. First, we check that our results are consistent with previous work. Next, we use this solution to answer some physically relevant questions related to the lubrication setting. For instance, we obtain theoretical and numerical results enabling to predict the apparition of a full film with respect to physical parameters (fluxes, shear velocity,...). In particular, we present a figure giving the number of stationary solutions depending on the physical parameters.

40|$|Cr-WS 2 {{nanocomposite}} {{solid lubricant}} coatings were prepared on mechanically textured stainless steel substrates. Micron-sized dimples of approximately 10 - 12 µm depth and 100 × 80 µm 2 area with uniform dimple spacing of 300 µm were created on the substrates using a knurling tool. Substrate surface texturing improved the tribological properties of Cr-WS 2 nanocomposite coatings significantly. Cr-WS 2 nanocomposite coatings prepared on textured steel substrates exhibited a friction coefficient of 0. 1 after 28, 800 cycles compared to coatings prepared on non-textured substrates which exhibited a friction coefficient of 0. 45.

However, it was found from past researches that, at the predefined mileage or timeframe, most lubricant is still acceptably usable and efficient. Approach: This research aimed to calculate useful life <b>of</b> <b>lubricant</b> {{in order to reach}} its maximum usefulness. The method of study began by collecting data that indicates deterioration <b>of</b> <b>lubricant</b> by increasing mileage which includes total base number, viscosity, iron and flash point.

40|$|This {{preliminary}} {{study on the}} maintenance <b>of</b> industrial <b>lubricants</b> for chemical plant investigated appropriate maintenance through condition monitoring <b>of</b> the <b>lubricants,</b> in particular autoxidation of base oil as the major degradation process. Changes in chemical and physical properties caused by the autoxidation of hydrocarbons were considered in terms of reaction sequence. The roles of antioxidants for maintaining the quality <b>of</b> <b>lubricants</b> were also considered. The reaction mechanism suggested the importance <b>of</b> antioxidants in <b>lubricants</b> during service. Therefore, a new method to diagnose consumption of antioxidant was required. Organic peroxides are reactive species generated during the autoxidation of hydrocarbons at the initial stage and can be quantitatively analyzed by iodometric titration. The peroxide value (POV) is proposed as a new parameter to monitor conditions <b>of</b> <b>lubricants.</b> The POV trace was examined by a model oxidation test <b>of</b> <b>lubricant</b> in the laboratory.

40|$|A tribologist’s {{dream is}} to predict {{the point at which}} a {{lubricant}} film will fail.

40|$|Wear of {{railroad}} rolling stock and rails costs {{millions of dollars}} annually in all rail systems throughout the world. The rail industry has attempted to address flange wear using rail curve lubricants and presently use a variety <b>of</b> <b>lubricants</b> and lubricant applicators. The choice <b>of</b> <b>lubricant</b> and applicator is currently based on considerations that do not address the wear problem directly. This research quantified rail curve lubricant performance through laboratory simulation. The effects <b>of</b> <b>lubricants</b> in the wheel/rail contact were investigated. Rail curve lubricant performance was measured with a laboratory rail/wheel simulator {{for the purpose of}} optimising the choice <b>of</b> <b>lubricant.</b> New methods for measurement <b>of</b> rail curve <b>lubricant</b> performance have been presented. These performance measurements are total absorbed energy, the energy absorbed in the <b>lubricant</b> film instead <b>of</b> being utilised for wear processes; total distance slid, the sliding distance or accumulated strain achieved prior to development of a set tractive force limit; half life <b>of</b> <b>lubricant,</b> the time taken for a lubricant to lose half of its sliding performance; and apparent viscosity, a measure of the lubricity presented with respect to accumulated strain. The rail/wheel simulator used in this research consists of two dissimilar wheels (disks) rotating in contact with one another simulating a conformal gauge corner contact. The first wheel, a simulated rail, is driven by an electric motor which then drives the second wheel, a simulated railroad wheel, through the contact. Hydraulic braking on the railroad wheel is used to simulate the rolling/sliding conditions. The variables of the simulated contact that are controlled with this equipment are normal force, input wheel speed, slip ratio between samples, sample geometries and material properties, and lubricant types. Rail curve lubricants were laboratory tested to define their properties using the ASTM and other appropriate standards. The performance differences measured using ASTM standards based tests were susceptible to repeatability problems and did not represent the contact as accurately as the rail/wheel simulator. This laboratory simulator was used to gather data in lubricated and unlubricated conditions for the purpose <b>of</b> providing <b>lubricant</b> performance measurements. These measurements were presented and the tested lubricants were ranked conclusively using three industrially relevant performance criteria. Total sliding distance and total absorbed energy measurements of the rail curve lubricants displayed clear differences in lubricant performance for both of these criteria. Total sliding distance is equivalent to the number of axles in the field situation, while total absorbed energy is the energy unavailable for wear processes of rails and wheels. Lubricants designed using these measurements will increase lubricant performance with respect to these performance criteria which in turn will reduce wear to both rails and wheels. Measurement of the apparent viscosity <b>of</b> rail curve <b>lubricants,</b> using the rail/wheel simulator, displayed changes in rheological characteristics with respect to accumulated strain. Apparent viscosity {{is a measure of the}} shear stress transmitted from the wheels to the rails. Designing a rail curve lubricant after analysing measurements taken from the rail/wheel simulator will assist in identifying lubricant properties to reduce the wear producing shear stresses generated in a rail wheel contact. Decay <b>of</b> <b>lubricant</b> performance was measured for three different rail curve lubricants under simulated conditions. The research found appreciable and quantifiable differences between <b>lubricants.</b> Industrial application <b>of</b> the findings will improve <b>positioning</b> <b>of</b> lubrication systems, improve choice <b>of</b> <b>lubricants</b> and predict effective lubrication distance from the lubricant application point.
