Protocols are written whenever it is desirable to standardize a laboratory method to ensure successful replication of results by others in the same laboratory or by other laboratories. Detailed protocols also facilitate the assessment of results through peer review. In addition to detailed procedures and lists of required equipment and instruments, protocols often include information on safety precautions, the calculation of results and reporting standards, including statistical analysis and rules for predefining and documenting excluded data to avoid bias. Protocols are employed {{in a wide range of}} experimental fields, from social science to quantum mechanics. Written protocols are also employed in manufacturing to ensure consistent quality.|$|E

40|$|A {{cost-effective}} method of military training is game-based training, for which custom geo-typical terrain models are often most suitable. However, for training instructors, scenario preparation is seriously slowed {{down by the}} complexity of current terrain modeling tools and methods. They would benefit from a quick {{and easy to use}} automated terrain modeler. The purpose of our declarative modeling framework is to offer an intuitive and fast way for instructors to model geo-typical terrain. We investigated how <b>procedural</b> <b>methods</b> can be developed and applied to quickly generate specific types of geo-typical terrain models. In this case study, we focused on generating terrain models that contain the typical natural and man-made features of southern Afghanistan. By analyzing these features and by developing and integrating <b>procedural</b> <b>methods</b> in our sketch-based terrain modeling framework, we found that one can quickly achieve convincing results. We present new and tailored methods that are fast and effective and that can generate a complete and consistent geo-typical Afghanistan-like terrain model. The results strengthen our belief that the framework is a firm step towards a declarative, automated terrain modeling process. Moreover, these <b>procedural</b> <b>methods</b> can be tailored to generate other types of geo-typical terrain...|$|R

50|$|Problems and Challenges in Survey {{research}} Survey research {{always has}} to make sure to define an adequate sample of interview partners. Finding such an adequate sample may bear some challenges, especially in comparative election campaign communication research. If scholars {{are not familiar with}} the local election network in a country they can deal with the complex task of finding e.g. major professional national campaign consultants by using membership lists of professional organizations or a snowball-sampling-approach. Disadvantageous, if a sample is not carefully selected, results may be biased. Internet survey research, in particular, is problematic with regard to selecting a representative sample.If a study does not document its exact research design and instruments, the results are not transparent, which can lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations. Therefore, the <b>procedural</b> <b>method</b> should explicitly be stated in a study. Further challenges when using survey research refer to the statistical assessment and interpretation of answers to open-ended questions as well as the translation and phrasing of questionnaires. In standardized large-scale surveys the accuracy and veracity of answers cannot be assured, since the research relies on the interview partners’ individual self-assessments of the questions and pre-formulated answers.|$|E
5000|$|Some have {{maintained}} that the most difficult aspect of the narrative to accept as authentic is its treatment of Roman legal proceedings. In fact, Polycarp’s trial is represented as taking place before {{one of the leading}} magistrates of the Empire on a public holiday, {{in the middle of a}} sport stadium, with no use of the tribunal, no formal legal accusation, and no official sentence. Though the trials of Christians, and of all subjects for that matter, were certainly subject to the governor’s <b>procedural</b> <b>method</b> of cognitio extra ordinem, some feel that this still does not explain the lack of a formal legal accusation and sentence. This line of argumentation against historicity could be all the more serious in so far as Roman capital trial procedure would presumably have been well known to the population of the time.Some have proposed that the Martyrdom of Polycarp is in fact a theological composition designed to support a particular understanding of martyrdom in relation to the Christian Gospel, among the elements cited being biblical parallelism, perceived apologia for lack of surviving relics, appearance of the expression 'Catholic church', the behavior of Quintus, the inventio-styled epigrams, and a clear preoccupation with the status of the martyrs. Some have gone so far as to suggest a late date for the composition of the text, perhaps in the first half of third century.|$|E

40|$|This thesis explores {{avenues for}} {{improving}} the quality and detail of game graphics, {{in the context of}} constraints that are common to most game development studios. The research begins by identifying two dominant constraints; limitations in the capacity of target gaming hardware/platforms, and processes that hinder the productivity of game art/content creation. From these constraints, themes were derived which directed the research‟s focus. These include the use of algorithmic or „procedural‟ methods in the creation of graphics content for games, and the use of an „interactive‟ content creation strategy, to better facilitate artist production workflow. Interactive workflow represents an emerging paradigm shift in content creation processes used by the industry, which directly integrates game rendering technology into the content authoring process. The primary motivation for this is to provide „high frequency‟ visual feedback that enables artists to see games content in context, during the authoring process. By merging these themes, this research develops a production strategy that takes advantage of „high frequency feedback‟ in an interactive workflow, to directly expose <b>procedural</b> <b>methods</b> to artists‟, for use in the content creation process. <b>Procedural</b> <b>methods</b> have a characteristically small „memory footprint‟ and are capable of generating massive volumes of data. Their small „size to data volume‟ ratio makes them particularly well suited for use in game rendering situations, where capacity constraints are an issue. In addition, an interactive authoring environment is well suited to the task of setting parameters for <b>procedural</b> <b>methods,</b> reducing a major barrier to their acceptance by artists. An interactive content authoring environment was developed during this research. Two algorithms were designed and implemented. These algorithms provide artists‟ with abstract mechanisms which accelerate common game content development processes; namely object placement in game environments, and the delivery of variation between similar game objects. In keeping with the theme of this research, the core functionality of these algorithms is delivered via <b>procedural</b> <b>methods.</b> Through this, production overhead that is associated with these content development processes is essentially offloaded from artists onto the processing capability of modern gaming hardware. This research shows how procedurally based content authoring algorithms not only harmonize with the issues of hardware capacity constraints, but also make the authoring of larger and more detailed volumes of games content more feasible in the game production process. Algorithms and ideas developed during this research demonstrate the use of procedurally based, interactive content creation, towards improving detail and complexity in the graphics of games...|$|R
