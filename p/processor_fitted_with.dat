50|$|An {{important}} {{distinguishing feature}} of the CS6400 which was not shared by the Sun SPARCcenter and SPARCserver was that each system was invariably equipped with an external System Service <b>Processor</b> (SSP) <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> a JTAG interface to configure the internal bus control card, the other systems have a JTAG interface {{but it is not}} routinely used. While the CS6400 strictly only requires an SSP when the configuration changes, (e.g. a CPU card is pulled for maintenance) some derivative designs, in particular the Sun Enterprise 10000, are useless without their matching SSP.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: A study {{performed}} in the 1990 s with analogue linear hearing aids showed that in patients with mixed hearing loss and an air-bone gap that exceeded 25 to 30 dB, speech perception was better with a bone-anchored hearing aid (Baha) than with a conventional behind-the-ear (BTE) device. The objective {{of the present study}} was to investigate whether this conclusion applies to today's digital BTEs with feedback cancellation and whether the crossover point still occurs at an air-bone gap of 25 to 30 dB. STUDY DESIGN: Case control. METHODS: Experienced unilateral Baha users with the latest digital Baha <b>processors</b> were <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> a powerful BTE with feedback cancellation. After an acclimatization period of 4 weeks, aided thresholds and speech recognition scores were determined and compared to those recorded previously with the Baha. To obtain patients' opinions, a disability-specific questionnaire was used. Participants comprised 16 subjects with bilateral mixed hearing loss participated RESULTS: Audiometric and speech recognition data showed similar trends to those described previously, but the crossover point had shifted to an air-bone gap of 30 to 35 dB. In the questionnaire, the BTE was rated higher than the Baha, except by the patients with an air-bone gap that exceeded an average of 45 dB. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with mixed hearing loss whose air-bone gap exceeded 35 dB, speech recognition is likely to be better with a Baha than with a BTE. Therefore, the Baha should receive greater consideration when mixed hearing loss is combined with a significant air-bone gap, even when there are no contraindications for BTEs...|$|R

50|$|During the 1930s, 5 H type were {{experimentally}} <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> pantographs of 5 different patterns. 376 was <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> a Simens Schukert pantograph, 377 was <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> a Fischer bow collector, 378 was <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> an ASEA pantograph, 379 was <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> a Metropolitan Vickers pantograph and 380 was <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> an English Electric pantograph. The pantographs on 376, 379 and 380 {{were all}} fitted {{on a small}} pantograph tower while 377 and 378 had their pantographs mounted on the roof itself. During the experiments, the pantographs were only used on the reserve track section {{which at the time}} was <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> a railway-like catenary overhead system rather than the traditional tramway-style overhead used {{on the rest of the}} system. Because the overhead at the time was not staggered to suit pantograph operation, the pantographs fitted all suffered from uneven wear and as a result the experiment ceased. Ironically, all the surviving H type trams were <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> pantographs 50 years later in October 1986.|$|R
