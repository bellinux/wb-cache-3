5000|$|Nominal Pipe Size (NPS) is a North American set of {{standard}} sizes for pipes used for {{high or low}} pressures and temperatures. [...] "Nominal" [...] refers to pipe in non-specific terms and identifies {{the diameter of the}} hole with a non-dimensional number (for example - [...] "2-inch nominal steel pipe" [...] consists of many varieties of steel pipe with the only criterion being a 2.375 inch outside diameter). Specific pipe is identified by pipe diameter and another non-dimensional number for wall thickness referred to as the Schedule (Sched. or Sch., for example - [...] "2 inch diameter <b>pipe,</b> <b>Schedule</b> 40"). NPS is often incorrectly called National Pipe Size, due to confusion with national pipe thread (NPT). The European and international designation equivalent to NPS is DN (diamètre nominal/nominal diameter/Durchmesser nach Norm), in which sizes are measured in millimetres, see ISO 6708. The term NB (nominal bore) is also frequently used interchangeably with NPS.|$|E

Replacement planning aims to minimize total costs {{while maintaining a}} satisfactory level of service and is usually conducted for individual <b>pipes.</b> <b>Scheduling</b> replacement in groups is seen {{to be a better}} method and has the potential to provide benefits such as the reduction of maintenance costs and service interruptions. However, developing group replacement schedules is a complex task and often beyond the ability of a human expert, especially when multiple or conflicting objectives need to be catered for, such as minimization of total costs and service interruptions. This paper describes the development of a novel replacement decision optimization model for group scheduling (RDOM-GS), which enables multiple group-scheduling criteria by integrating new cost functions, a service interruption model, and optimization algorithms into a unified procedure.

40|$|Accurate flow {{measurement}} {{is essential for}} the management of any type of fluid system. In order for a meter to accurately measure the flow, some installation requirements must be met. These installation requirements are meant to produce a condition where there are limited flow disturbances as the fluid enters the meter. If flow disturbances do occur, the meter may produce inaccurate measurements. This research investigated the effect on accuracy that different types of 12 -inch flow meters have as a result of being installed in pipelines of differing inside diameter. The types of meters chosen for this research were the portable ultrasonic meter, the magnetic meter, and four types of differential pressure meters: classical Venturi, Halmi Venturi Tube, V-cone, and the wedge meter. Each meter was tested for accuracy with ten different <b>pipe</b> <b>schedules</b> installed upstream forming a pipewall offset varying between + 0. 125 inches and 0. 937 inches. Ten flow rates between 400 gpm and 6, 550 gpm were considered for each test setup. The meters’ accuracy during each test series was compared to the specified accuracy as defined by the manufacturer of the meter. All results were displayed graphically for comparison. In general, most of the meters tested were affected by the disturbances caused by the pipewall offsets, and some meters were more affected than others. The measurement error was found to be as high as 8 % for the ultrasonic meter type. This research demonstrated that for accurate {{flow measurement}}, most flow meters require that the inside diameter of the piping be the same as the inside diameter as the meter. Laboratory tests showed that the wedge meter was not dependent upon the upstream pipe installation.

Both technologies involve transducers that are simply clamped on to the pipe and programmed with the <b>pipe</b> size and <b>schedule</b> and can be used to calculate flow.

The deterioration of these assets and the optimal allocation of limited budget for their maintenance correspond to crucial challenges for water utility managers. Decision makers should be assisted with optimal solutions to select the best maintenance plan concerning available resources and management strategies. Much research effort has been dedicated {{to the development of}} optimal strategies for maintenance of water pipes. Most of the maintenance strategies are intended for <b>scheduling</b> individual water <b>pipe.</b> Consideration of optimal group scheduling replacement jobs for groups of pipes or other linear assets has so far not received much attention in literature. It is a common practice that replacement planners select two or three pipes manually with ambiguous criteria to group into one replacement job. This is obviously not the best solution for job grouping and may not be cost effective, especially when total cost can be up to multiple million dollars. In this paper, an optimal group scheduling scheme with three decision criteria for distributed pipeline assets maintenance decision is proposed. A Maintenance Grouping Optimization (MGO) model with multiple criteria is developed. An immediate challenge of such modeling is to deal with scalability of vast combinatorial solution space. To address this issue, a modified genetic algorithm is developed together with a Judgment Matrix.

Research in explosives analysis for intact and post-blast samples {{continue to be a}} topic in which practitioners are constantly improving and searching for faster methods and techniques to analyze these sample types. The key role crime laboratories play in analyzing these sample types can have limitations, such as increasing turnaround times and backlogs. This concern additionally plays a role in the safety of the public if an unknown individual has not been discovered. Current analytical instrumentation in which explosives are analyzed includes Gas Chromatography – Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), Liquid Chromatography – Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS), and Ion Mobility Spectrometry (IMS). Each instrument has benefits in the analytical results obtained. Direct Analysis in Real Time - Mass Spectrometry (DART-MS) has shown a significant promise as an analytical approach that can help remedy the time an explosive sample is analyzed, while additionally providing discriminating analytical results. Previous research has shown that DART-MS is capable of analyzing explosives, including smokeless powder. A limitation currently in the area of smokeless powder analysis with DART-MS is the application of utilizing this method and technology to realistic casework that may be encountered in forensic laboratories. Intact and post-blast explosive samples encountered in forensic laboratories arrive in various states and conditions. For example, the severity of the blast and environmental factors {{may play a role in}} the detection of smokeless powder on these sample types. To provide objective information and additional research, studies were conducted with mixture samples of smokeless powder and potential matrices that may be encountered in real world case samples. Faster processing time, in addition to the discrimination of smokeless powder, was the ultimate goal of this research. Due to the complexity of the mass spectra that may be generated from sample mixtures, an extraction technique coupled with DART-MS was investigated. A liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) method and dynamic headspace concentration using Carbopack™ X coated wire mesh were tested for the effectiveness of separating the analytes of interest of smokeless powder from various matrix interferences.

40|$|Water {{distribution}} systems (WDS) worldwide face increasing {{challenges as}} population growth strains a limited water supply in many areas. In the United States, existing water infrastructure systems require significant investments to refurbish an aging stock of assets. Much of this investment {{is required in}} drinking water transmission and distribution, where {{a substantial amount of}} material and economic inputs are lost as a result of pipeline leaks. With growing worldwide concern for reducing environmental impacts of the built environment, infrastructure investment on the scale of WDSs must be accurately assessed for potential unintended consequences. U. S. water infrastructure systems have already been identified as a major consumer of energy: it is estimated that 13 % of the total U. S. electricity demand is consumed by water-related energy use. The existing literature on environmental assessment of WDSs does not provide a comprehensive, detailed picture of the total impacts of utilities. The current body of knowledge either omits common WDS elements or focuses on solving theoretical design problems. This research provides a framework for the most comprehensive greenhouse-gas (GHG) emission assessment of U. S. WDSs with the most accurate data available. This research presents opportunities for incorporating environmental metrics into asset management, a popular management strategy used by utility managers worldwide. The major contributors to emissions in WDSs are identified, and cost-effective solutions for reducing GHG emissions are recommended. A major opportunity in cost-effective GHG reduction lies in effectively reducing distribution losses from leaks in pipelines. This dissertation provides a model, tool, and analysis solutions that help communicate the GHG emissions associated with leaks and the related economic costs for reducing these leaks. This dissertation employs life-cycle assessment (LCA) in determining the GHG footprint of a WDS. LCA is a commonly used, holistic environmental assessment method. Products and processes are analyzed from "cradle to grave" which implies that all supply chain entities, both upstream and downstream, are included in the assessment. This research uses hybrid LCA methods to reduce uncertainty in providing the most accurate assessment possible. The study focuses on four major elements of a WDS: water storage, pipes, water wells, and pumping. These entities, namely water storage, water wells, and booster pumps, have never been analyzed at this level of detail in previous research. Each element is separately analyzed for GHG contributions to a drinking water utility's footprint. Whenever possible, the most relevant LCA data are used in creating the overall model. This represents a WDS LCA with better data than have previously been used in any of the existing literature, which often omits infrastructure aspects or reuses inaccurate data from previous work. The scope of work includes material production, construction, operation, and maintenance of a case study U. S. WDS. Material production includes all supply chain entities involved in delivering materials for use in the WDS. Construction involves all equipment use and temporary materials used in the assembly and installation of the WDS elements. Operation and maintenance encompasses all emissions that result from inputs related to the delivery of drinking water to customers after construction is completed. Determining the GHG emissions of leaks in distribution and transmission is a major facet of the operation and maintenance assessment. A tool is developed to calculate <b>pipe</b> replacement <b>scheduling</b> based on GHG emissions from leaks. The LCA results are based on a case study for a distribution system utility located in the Western United States. The case study utility draws all water from a large, pristine aquifer and pumps this water to storage tanks at higher elevations to create a gravity fed system. It has no dedicated transmission lines, and the high pressure spikes from pumping with a small operating budget have created a WDS that loses 40 % of pumped and treated water in distribution. The LCA results show that pumping energy contributes the majority to the case study utility's GHG footprint, accounting for 84 % of the total emissions. Losses, the majority of which are assumed to be leaks by the case study utility, contribute 40 % to this number. Piping materials (6 %) and maintenance (5 %) are the next largest contributors to the total GHG emissions for a 50 -year analysis period. Projections for growth show that decarbonization of the local electricity mix and reducing distribution losses could significantly reduce GHG emissions despite service growth for the case study utility. Assessing water storage options showed that concrete reservoirs had significantly higher impacts than steel tanks on a storage capacity basis. As distribution losses from leaks were found to contribute significantly to the GHG footprint, this research developed a "breakeven" tool to give utilities an environmental perspective on <b>pipe</b> replacement <b>scheduling.</b> The tool's results show that accrued GHG emissions quickly matched the emissions that would result from construction and material inputs from replacing the pipe, even for modest leak increase rates. These results are {{in stark contrast to the}} case study utility's current replacement schedule, which operates on a 300 -year cycle due to economic constraints. To give the breakeven tool results more context, this dissertation uses the utility's reported pipe replacement costs to compare GHG emissions and economic costs for different leak scenarios. This comparison effectively allows utility representatives to visualize the costs of potential GHG emission savings by reducing leaks. For the case study utility's inputs, avoiding GHG emissions through pipe replacement was revealed to be cost effective. Although the case study utility has unique aspects uncommon to many U. S. WDSs, such as the high loss volume and low treatment inputs, the LCA model assesses other materials and processes that can be applied to GHG assessments of other WDSs. The new LCA data sources reduce uncertainty for future applications. This research provides evidence that WDSs can cost-effectively reduce their GHG footprint, and that the entirety of WDS infrastructure can be targeted for GHG reductions by policy makers. The GHG intensities of drinking water and cost effectiveness of GHG savings through leak reduction were estimated for California and Texas. These scenario analyses showed that values vary with different regions based on the treatment and pumping requirements, and that there are diminishing returns for GHG savings in leak reduction. Still, the economic cost of avoiding emissions through leak reduction was determined to be an extremely cost-effective option for carbon abatement when compared to other infrastructure solutions, such as renewable energy options...|$|R
40|$|A water {{distribution}} system {{is composed of}} thousands of pipes of varying materials, sizes, and ages. These pipes experience physical, environmental, and operational factors that cause deterioration and ultimately lead to their failure. Pipe deterioration results in increased break rates, decreased hydraulic capacity, and adverse effects on water quality. Pipe failures result in economic losses to the governing municipality due to loss of service, cost of pipe repair/replacement, damage incurred due to flooding, and disruptions to normal business operations. Inspecting the entire {{water distribution}} system for deterioration is difficult and economically unfeasible; therefore, it benefits municipalities to utilize a risk assessment model to identify the most critical components {{of the system and}} develop an effective rehabilitation or replacement schedule. This study compared two risk assessment models, a statistically complex model and a simplified model. Based on the physical, environmental, and operational conditions of each pipe, these models estimate the probability of failure, quantify the consequences of a failure, and ultimately determine the risk of failure of a pipe. The models differ in their calculation of the probability of failure. The statistically complex model calculates the probability of failure based on pipe material, diameter, length, internal pressure, land use, and age. The simplified model only accounts for pipe material and age in its calculation of probability of failure. Consequences of a pipe failure include the cost to replace the pipe, service interruption, traffic impact, and customer criticality impact. The risk of failure of a pipe is determined as the combination of the probability of failure and the consequences of a failure. Based on the risk of failure of each pipe within the water distribution system, a ranking system is developed, which identifies the pipes with the most critical risk. Utilization of this ranking system allows municipalities to effectively allocate funds for rehabilitation. This study analyzed the 628 -pipe water distribution system in the City of Buellton, California. Four analyses were completed on the system, an original analysis and three sensitivity analyses. The sensitivity analyses displayed the worst-case scenarios for the water distribution system for each assumed variable. The results of the four analyses are provided below. Risk Analysis Simplified Model Complex Model Original Analysis All pipes were low risk All pipes were low risk Sensitivity Analysis: Older Pipe Age Identified 2 medium risk pipes Identified 2 medium risk pipes Sensitivity Analysis: Lower Anticipated Service Life Identified 2 medium risk pipes Identified 9 high risk pipes and 283 medium risk pipes Sensitivity Analysis: Older Pipe Age and Lower Anticipated Service Life Identified 1 high risk pipe and 330 medium risk pipes Identified 111 critical risk pipes, 149 high risk pipes, and 137 medium risk pipes Although the results appeared similar in the original analysis, {{it was clear that the}} statistically complex model incorporated additional deterioration factors into its analysis, which increased the probability of failure and ultimately the risk of failure of each pipe. With sufficient data, it is recommended that the complex model be utilized to more accurately account for the factors that cause pipe failures. This study proved that a risk assessment model is effective in identifying critical components and developing a <b>pipe</b> maintenance <b>schedule.</b> Utilization of a risk assessment model will allow municipalities to effectively allocate funds and optimize their water distribution system.

40|$|The {{expected}} {{increased demand}} in fuel for nuclear power plants, {{combined with the}} fact that {{a significant portion of the}} current supply from the blend down of weapons-source material will soon be coming to an end, has led to the need for new sources of enriched uranium for nuclear fuel. As a result, a number of countries have announced plans, or are currently building, gaseous centrifuge enrichment plants (GCEPs) to supply this material. GCEPs have the potential to produce uranium at enrichments above the level necessary for nuclear fuel purposes-enrichments that make the uranium potentially usable for nuclear weapons. As a result, there is a critical need to monitor these facilities to ensure that nuclear material is not inappropriately enriched or diverted for unintended use. Significant advances have been made in instrument capability since the current International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) monitoring methods were developed. In numerous cases, advances have been made in other fields that have the potential, with modest development, to be applied in safeguards applications at enrichment facilities. A particular example of one of these advances is the flow and enrichment monitor (FEMO). (See Gunning, J. E. et al., 'FEMO: A Flow and Enrichment Monitor for Verifying Compliance with International Safeguards Requirements at a Gas Centrifuge Enrichment Facility,' Proceedings of the 8 th International Conference on Facility Operations - Safeguards Interface. Portland, Oregon, March 30 -April 4 th, 2008.) The FEMO is a conceptual instrument capable of continuously measuring, unattended, the enrichment and mass flow of {sup 235 }U in pipes at a GCEP, and consequently increase the probability that the potential production of HEU and/or diversion of fissile material will be detected. The FEMO requires no piping penetrations and can be installed on pipes containing the flow of uranium hexafluoride (UF{sub 6 }) at a GCEP. This FEMO consists of separate parts, a flow monitor (FM) and an enrichment monitor (EM). Development of the FM is primarily the responsibility of Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and development of the EM is primarily the responsibility of Los Alamos National Laboratory. The FM will measure {sup 235 }U mass flow rate by combining information from measuring the UF{sub 6 } volumetric flow rate and the {sup 235 }U density. The UF{sub 6 } flow rate will be measured using characteristics of the process pumps used in product and tail UF{sub 6 } header process lines of many GCEPs, and the {sup 235 }U density will be measured using commercially available sodium iodide (NaI) gamma ray scintillation detectors. This report describes the calibration of the portion of the FM that measures the {sup 235 }U density. Research has been performed to define a methodology and collect data necessary to perform this calibration without the need for plant declarations. The {sup 235 }U density detector is a commercially available system (GammaRad made by Amptek, www. amptek. com) that contains the NaI crystal, photomultiplier tube, signal conditioning electronics, and a multichannel analyzer (MCA). Measurements were made with the detector system installed near four {sup 235 }U sources. Two of the sources were made of solid uranium, and the other two were in the form of UF{sub 6 } gas in aluminum piping. One of the UF{sub 6 } gas sources was located at ORNL and the other at LANL. The ORNL source consisted of two <b>pipe</b> sections (<b>schedule</b> 40 aluminum <b>pipe</b> of 4 -inch and 8 -inch outside diameter) with 5. 36 % {sup 235 }U enrichment, and the LANL source was a 4 -inch <b>schedule</b> 40 aluminum <b>pipe</b> with 3. 3 % {sup 235 }U enrichment. The configurations of the detector on these test sources, as well as on long straight pipe configurations expected to exist at GCEPs, were modeled using the computer code MCNP. The results of the MCNP calculations were used to define geometric correction factors between the test source and the GCEP application. Using these geometric correction factors, the experimental 186 keV counts in the test geometry were extrapolated to the expected GCEP geometry, and calibration curves were developed. A unique method to analyze the measurement was also developed that separated the detector spectrum into the five detectable decay gamma rays emitted by {sup 235 }U in the 120 to 200 keV energy range. This analysis facilitated the assignment of a consistent value for the detector counts originating from {sup 235 }U decays at 186 keV. This value is also more accurate because it includes the counts from gamma energies other than 186 keV, which results in increased counting statistics for the same measurement time. The 186 keV counts expected as a function of pressure and enrichment are presented in the body of this report. The main result of this research is a calibration factor for 4 -inch and 8 -inch <b>schedule</b> 40 aluminum <b>pipes.</b> For 4 -inch pipes, the {sup 235 }U density is 0. 62 {sup 235 }U g/m{sup 3 } per each measured 186 keV count...|$|R
