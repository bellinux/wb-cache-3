50|$|Terrestrial plant material, seeds, {{and marine}} shells from Champlain Sea core samples {{have been used}} as proxies for paleosalinity. By {{studying}} δ13C (change in carbon-13) of marine mollusks, it can be inferred that when they existed in the Champlain Sea, conditions were brackish (mixture of fresh and salt water) about 10.8 ka BP. The δ13C value of a core sample Melo-1 (see Fig. 3 for location) indicates the amount of light carbon that is present. Biota preferentially intake light carbon, so the more that is present in a sample, the more biota that was present at that time. Additionally, core samples from the Champlain Sea indicate a change in assemblages from those that inhabit marine environments to those that live in much less saline conditions at about 11.4 to 11.2 ka BP (Fig. 4). In the specific core sample (core Melo-5, location noted in Fig. 3) analysis shown in Fig. 4, there is a change in assemblages from almost 100% E. clavata (which inhabits marine environments) to >50% E. albiumbilicatum (which prefers less saline conditions)—both species of Elphidium. This transition seems to be probable, as it has been corroborated by multiple studies. The overall decrease in salinity has been estimated to be from 25 psu to less than 15 psu (<b>practical</b> <b>salinity</b> units). The decrease in salinity starting at Melo-1 and moving to Melo-5 indicates a downstream translation of freshening.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The International Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater – 2010 {{has defined}} the {{thermodynamic}} properties of seawater {{in terms of}} a new salinity variable, Absolute Salinity, which takes into account the spatial variation of the composition of seawater. Absolute Salinity more accu-rately reflects the effects of the dissolved material in seawater on the thermodynamic properties (particularly density) than does <b>Practical</b> <b>Salinity.</b> When a seawater sample has standard composition (i. e. the ratios of the constituents of sea salt are the same as those of surface water of the North Atlantic), <b>Practical</b> <b>Salinity</b> can be used to accurately evaluate the thermodynamic proper-ties of seawater. When seawater is not of standard compo-sition, <b>Practical</b> <b>Salinity</b> alone is not sufficient and the Ab-solute Salinity Anomaly needs to be estimated; this anomaly is as large as 0. 025 g kg− 1 in the northernmost North Pacific. Here we provide an algorithm for estimating Absolute Salin-ity Anomaly for any location (x,y,p) in the world ocean. To develop this algorithm, we used the Absolute Salinity Anomaly that is found by comparing the density calculated from <b>Practical</b> <b>Salinity</b> to the density measured in the labora-tory. These estimates of Absolute Salinity Anomaly however are limited to the number of available observations (namely 811). In order to provide a practical method that can be used at any location in the world ocean, we take advantage of ap-proximate relationships between Absolute Salinity Anomaly and silicate concentrations (which are available globally). ...|$|E

40|$|Salinity {{determination}} in seawater {{has been}} carried out for almost 30 years using the 1978 <b>Practical</b> <b>Salinity</b> Standard. However, the numerical value of so-called <b>practical</b> <b>salinity,</b> computed from electrical conductivity, differs slightly from the true or absolute salinity, defined as the mass of dissolved solids per unit mass of seawater. The difference arises because more recent knowledge about the composition of seawater is not reflected in the definition of <b>practical</b> <b>salinity,</b> which was chosen to maintain historical continuity with previous measures, and because of spatial and temporal variations in the relative composition of seawater. Accounting for these variations in density calculations requires the calculation of a correction factor δSA, which is known to range from 0 to 0. 03 g kg&minus; 1 in the world oceans. Here a mathematical model relating compositional perturbations to δSA is developed, by combining a chemical model for the composition of seawater with a mathematical model for predicting the conductivity of multi-component aqueous solutions. Model calculations generally agree with estimates of δSA based on fits to direct density measurements, and show that biogeochemical perturbations affect conductivity only weakly. However, small systematic differences between model and density-based estimates remain. These may arise for several reasons, including uncertainty about the biogeochemical processes involved in the increase in Total Alkalinity in the North Pacific, uncertainty in the carbon content of IAPSO standard seawater, and uncertainty about the haline contraction coefficient for the constituents involved in biogeochemical processes. This model may then be important in constraining these processes, as well as in future efforts to improve parameterizations for δSA...|$|E
