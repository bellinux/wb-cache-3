5000|$|A {{signal peptide}} (sometimes {{referred}} to as signal sequence, targeting signal, localization signal, localization sequence, transit <b>peptide,</b> <b>leader</b> sequence or leader peptide) is a short peptide (usually 16-30 amino acids long) [...] present at the N-terminus {{of the majority of}} newly synthesized proteins that are destined towards the secretory pathway.These proteins include those that reside either inside certain organelles (the endoplasmic reticulum, golgi or endosomes), secreted from the cell, or inserted into most cellular membranes. Although most type I membrane-bound proteins have signal peptides, the majority of type II and multi-spanning membrane-bound proteins are targeted to the secretory pathway by their first transmembrane domain, which biochemically resembles a signal sequence except that it is not cleaved.|$|E
30|$|Improvement of M 13 display can be {{achieved}} by using engineered helper phages such as the “Phaberge” helper phage that contains an amber mutation on its genome favoring the assembling of phage particles containing the recombinant pIII-fusion protein when non-suppressive E. coli host cells were infected (Soltes et al. 2003). Also, improvement of display of several different proteins on M 13 was achieved by changing the commonly used <b>peptide</b> <b>leader</b> sequence of the fusion protein, that relies on the Sec translocation pathway, for a <b>peptide</b> <b>leader</b> sequence that relies on the signal recognition particle pathway (SRP) (Steiner et al. 2006). The Sec and SPR pathways translocate proteins to the periplasm post-translationally and co-translationally, respectively (Steiner et al. 2006). Contrary to phage display, ribosome display is a free-cell system that does not require in vivo processes to display the proteins; therefore the environment for production, folding and stability of the interest-protein can be manipulated and optimized in vitro. These features have been exploited to select and evolve peptides, proteins and antibody fragments (Wörn and Plückthun 2001; Jermetus et al. 2001; Osada et al. 2009; Mouratou et al. 2007; Correa et al. 2014).|$|E
30|$|We {{show that}} the {{recombinant}} expression of ErL-ASNase in E. coli results in the secretion to the culture medium due {{to the presence of}} its natural <b>peptide</b> <b>leader</b> at the N-terminus. We developed an L-Asp-based affinity adsorbent which allowed the purification of the enzyme in one step, achieving high purity levels. This approach is advantageous over the other conventional tag-based purification methods, which require additional treatment steps for the cleavage and isolation of the affinity tags. Overall, the strategy employed for expression and purification of this protein drug uses green chemistry principles allowing the reduction of processing time and purification steps, making the approach more sustainable and attractive.|$|E

We have also deter-mined that mutacin 1140 <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> contains a novel four amino acid motif compared to related lantibiotics. PTM enzyme recognition of the <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> appears to be evolutionarily distinct from related class I lantibiotics.

Peptide synthesis was directed by self-ligated short restriction fragments containing the trp promoter and leader regions. Synthesis of <b>leader</b> <b>peptides</b> was established by demonstrating that they were labeled in vitro only by those amino acids predicted {{to be present in}} the <b>peptides.</b> <b>Leader</b> <b>peptide</b> synthesis was abolished by the addition of the Escherichia coli trp repressor. The E. coli trp <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> was found to be extremely labile in vitro; it had a half-life of 3 - 4 min. In a highly purified DNA-dependent peptide-synthesizing system, synthesis of the di- and tripeptides predicted from the Salmonella typhimurium trp operon leader sequence, fMet-Ala and fMet-Ala-Ala, also was observed. Using this dipeptide synthesis system, we demonstrated that translation initiation at the ribosome binding site used for trp <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> synthesis was reduced 10 -fold when the transcript contained a segment complementary to the ribosome binding site...|$|R
50|$|The exact {{mechanism}} {{of the association of}} the trimeric enzyme complex with the N-terminal <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> region is not yet understood; however, it is thought that the <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> is cleaved from the core peptide putatively by the peptidase contained in the biosynthetic gene cluster. Following <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> removal, the newly formed N-terminus undergoes methylation to yield an Nα,Nα-dimethylarginine. This final modification results in mature PZN.|$|R
30|$|Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) {{produces}} insecticidal {{proteins that}} have been used worldwide in the control of insect-pests in crops and vectors of human diseases. However, different insect species are poorly controlled by the available Bt toxins or have evolved resistance to these toxins. Evolution of Bt toxicity could provide novel toxins to control insect pests. To this aim, efficient display systems to select toxins with increased binding to insect membranes or midgut proteins involved in toxicity are likely to be helpful. Here we describe two display systems, phage display and ribosome display, that allow the efficient display of two non-structurally related Bt toxins, Cry 1 Ac and Cyt 1 Aa. Improved display of Cry 1 Ac and Cyt 1 Aa on M 13 phages was achieved by changing the commonly used <b>peptide</b> <b>leader</b> sequence of the coat pIII-fusion protein, that relies on the Sec translocation pathway, for a <b>peptide</b> <b>leader</b> sequence that relies on the signal recognition particle pathway (SRP) and by using a modified M 13 helper phage (Phaberge) that has an amber mutation in its pIII genomic sequence and preferentially assembles using the pIII-fusion protein. Also, both Cry 1 Ac and Cyt 1 Aa were efficiently displayed on ribosomes, which could allow the construction of large libraries of variants. Furthermore, Cry 1 Ac or Cyt 1 Aa displayed on M 13 phages or ribosomes were specifically selected from a mixture of both toxins depending on which antigen was immobilized for binding selection. These improved systems may allow the selection of Cry toxin variants with improved insecticidal activities that could counter insect resistances.|$|E
30|$|The {{long-term}} {{usage of}} L-asparaginase leads to life-threatening multiple toxic effects. Among its multiple toxic effects, L-asparaginase induces allergic reactions usually due to low purity enzyme preparations {{and the presence}} of unwanted contaminations by bacterial proteins. Therefore, efficient recombinant expression, coupled with simple, rapid and low cost purification protocol would assist the overall production scheme of such an important enzyme, whose purity is extremely critical due to its use for human treatment. The aim of the present work is to study the optimization of the extracellular expression of ErL-ASNase in E. coli by attaching its natural <b>peptide</b> <b>leader</b> at the N-terminus. The secreted recombinant L-ASNase was ultimately purified by applying an efficient one-step affinity chromatographic protocol.|$|E
30|$|In {{the case}} of phage display we show here that the display of two {{structurally}} non-related Bt toxins could be improved by changing the <b>peptide</b> <b>leader</b> sequence of the fusion protein, that relies on the Sec translocation pathway, for a <b>peptide</b> <b>leader</b> sequence that relies on the signal recognition particle pathway (SRP). Since the Sec pathway translocates proteins post-translationally while the SRP pathway co-translationally, this result suggests that Cry 1 Ac folding in the cytoplasm limits translocation and display efficiencies. Furthermore, we show that by using a helper phage (Phaberge) that assembles phage particle preferring the Cry 1 Ac-pIII fusion protein, display of Cry 1 Ac was further improved (Fig.  1 a). More interestingly we show that Cry 1 Ac is properly folded retaining its receptor binding capacities and toxicity. Using the system described here we have successfully displayed Cry 3 Aa toxin that is toxic to coleopteran insects (Additional file 1 : Figure S 1). The phage display system described here allows great flexibility for panning selection since the different display levels of Cry toxins {{could be used for}} selection of variants with different binding affinities. Enhanced display of Bt toxin libraries using Phaberge and SRP translocation sequence are likely to select binders with moderate affinity due to the selection of binders by avidity since several binding sites are present in one phage particle. Consecutive mutagenesis and selection using display systems that allow moderate (SRP sequence and M 13) or low (Sec sequence and M 13) display efficiencies would select binders with higher binding affinities. We believe that depending on the binding target (receptor vs insect gut membranes) and toxicity of the native Cry toxin used for library construction the phage display systems described here could be useful to put in place a panning procedures to select improved toxins.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTranscription is {{a complex}} process that relies on the {{cooperative}} interaction between sequence-specific factors and the basal transcription machinery. The strength of a promoter depends on upstream or downstream cis-acting DNA elements, which bind transcription factors. In this study, we investigated whether DNA elements located downstream of the JCV late promoter, encompassing the late <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> region, which encodes agnoprotein, play regulatory roles in the JCV lytic cycle. For this purpose, the entire coding region of the <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> was deleted and the functional consequences of this deletion were analyzed. We found that viral gene expression and replication were drastically reduced. Gene expression also decreased from a <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> point mutant but to a lesser extent. This suggested that the <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> region of JCV might contain critical cis-acting DNA elements to which transcription factors bind and regulate viral gene expression and replication. We analyzed the entire coding region of the late <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> by a footprinting assay and identified three major regions (region I, II and III) that were protected by nuclear proteins. Further investigation {{of the first two}} protected regions by band shift assays revealed a new band that appeared in new infection cycles, suggesting that viral infection induces new factors that interact with the late <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> region of JCV. Analysis of the effect of the <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> region on the promoter activity of JCV by transfection assays demonstrated that this region has a positive and negative effect on the large T antigen (LT-Ag) -mediated activation of the viral early and late promoters, respectively. Furthermore, a partial deletion analysis of the <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> region encompassing the protected regions I and II demonstrated a significant down-regulation of viral gene expression and replication. More importantly, these results were similar to that obtained from a complete deletion of the late <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> region, indicating the critical importance of these two protected regions in JCV regulation. Altogether, these findings suggest that the late <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> region contains important regulatory elements to which transcription factors bind and contribute to the JCV gene regulation and replication...|$|R

40|$|The {{structural}} gene of the S- 1 subunit of pertussis toxin (rS- 1) and the catalytic C 180 peptide of the S- 1 subunit (C 180 peptide) were independently subcloned downstream of the tac promoter in Escherichia coli. Both constructions included DNA encoding for the predicted leader {{sequence of the}} S- 1 subunit which was inserted between the tac promoter and the {{structural gene}}. E. coli containing the plasmids encoding for rS- 1 and C 180 peptide produced a peptide that reacted with anti-pertussis toxin antibody and had a molecular weight corresponding {{to that of the}} cloned gene; some degradation of rS- 1 was observed. Extracts of E. coli containing plasmids encoding for rS- 1 and the C 180 peptide possessed ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. Subcellular fractionation showed that both rS- 1 and the C 180 peptide were present in the periplasm, indicating that E. coli recognized the pertussis toxin <b>peptide</b> <b>leader</b> sequence. The protein sequence of the amino terminus of the C 180 peptide was identical to that of authentic S- 1 subunit produced by Bordetella pertussis, which showed that E. coli leader peptidase correctly processed the pertussis toxin <b>peptide</b> <b>leader</b> sequence. Two single amino acid substitutions at residue 26 (C 180 I- 26) and residue 139 (C 180 S- 139) which were previously shown to reduce ADP-ribosyltransferase activity were introduced into the C 180 peptide. C 180 I- 26 possessed approximately 1 % of the NAD-glycohydrolase activity of the C 180 peptide, suggesting that tryptophan 26 functions in the interaction of NAD with the C 180 peptide. In contrast, C 180 S- 139 possessed essentially the same level of NAD-glycohydrolase activity as the C 180 peptide, suggesting that glutamic acid 139 does not function in the interaction of NAD but plays a role in a later step in the ADP-ribosyltransferase reaction...|$|E
30|$|Phage {{display system}} allows {{selection}} of protein variants with improved binding characteristics (Azzazy and Highsmith 2002; Mullen et al. 2006). For this purpose, the foreign protein DNA sequence is fused to a coat protein gene enabling the fusion protein to be {{displayed on the}} surface of the phage that can be then screened by enabling the phage to interact with ligands, a process known as biopanning allowing the molecular evolution of proteins (Dröge et al. 2003; Mullen et al. 2006). To display the fusion protein, it has to be translocated to the host periplasm by a <b>peptide</b> <b>leader</b> sequence while a helper phage provides all the necessary components for phage assembly. In contrast, the ribosome display system involves an in vitro translation of the protein that prevents the synthesized protein and the mRNA from leaving the ribosome and binders with improved affinities are selected by panning (Hanes and Plückthun 1997). Ribosome-display allows construction of libraries with sizes up to 1014 in contrast with phage display where libraries of 109 size are typically obtained due to the limitation in E. coli transformation efficiency (Dreier and Pluckthun 2011).|$|E
40|$|Carnobacterium maltaromaticum UAL 307, {{isolated}} from fresh pork, exhibits potent activity against {{a number of}} gram-positive organisms, including numerous Listeria species. Three bacteriocins were {{isolated from}} culture supernatant, and using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and Edman sequencing, two of these bacteriocins were identified as piscicolin 126 and carnobacteriocin BM 1, {{both of which have}} previously been described. The remaining bacteriocin, with a molecular mass of 5, 862 Da, could not be sequenced by traditional methods, suggesting that the peptide was either cyclic or N-terminally blocked. This bacteriocin showed remarkable stability over a wide temperature and pH range and was unaffected by a variety of proteases. After digestion with trypsin and α-chymotrypsin, the peptide was de novo sequenced by tandem mass spectrometry and a linear sequence deduced, consisting of 60 amino acids. Based on this sequence, the molecular mass was predicted to be 5, 880 Da, 18 units higher than the observed molecular mass, which suggested that the peptide has a cyclic structure. Identification of the genetic sequence revealed that this peptide is circular, formed by a covalent linkage between the N and C termini following cleavage of a 4 -residue <b>peptide</b> <b>leader</b> sequence. The results of structural studies suggest that the peptide is highly structured in aqueous conditions.

The 15 -amino acid <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> {{is processed}} after export to the intermembrane space. <b>Leader</b> <b>peptides</b> are relatively unusual in mitochondrially coded proteins: indeed mammalian Cox 2 p lacks a <b>leader</b> <b>peptide.</b> We generated two deletions in the S. cerevisiae COX 2 gene, removing either the <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> (cox 2 - 20) or the <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> and processing site (cox 2 - 21) without altering either the promoter or the mRNA-specific translational activation site. When inserted into mtDNA, both deletions substantially reduced the steady-state levels of Cox 2 p and caused a tight nonrespiratory phenotype. A respiring pseudorevertant of the cox 2 - 20 mutant was heteroplasmic {{for the original}} mutant mtDNA and a ρ(-) mtDNA whose deletion fused the first 251 codons of the mitochondrial gene encoding cytochrome b to the cox 2 - 20 sequence. The resulting fusion protein was processed to yield functional Cox 2 p. Thus, the presence of amino-terminal cytochrome b sequence bypassed {{the need for the}} pre-Cox 2 p <b>leader</b> <b>peptide.</b> We propose that the pre-Cox 2 p <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> contains a targeting signal necessary for membrane insertion, without which it remains in the matrix and is rapidly degraded...|$|R
40|$|F-pilin {{maturation}} and translocation {{result in}} the cleavage of a 51 -amino-acid leader sequence from propilin and require LepB and TraQ but not the SecA-SecY secretion pathway. The unusual propilin <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> and the dependence of its cleavage on TraQ suggested that TraQ recognition may be specific for the <b>leader</b> <b>peptide.</b> An in vitro propilin cleavage assay yielded propilin (13 kDa), the pilin polypeptide (7 kDa), and a 5. 5 -kDa protein as the traA products. The 5. 5 -kDa protein comigrates with the full-length 51 -amino-acid <b>leader</b> <b>peptide,</b> and [14 C]proline labeling confirmed its identity since the only proline residues of propilin are found within the <b>leader</b> <b>peptide.</b> The in vitro and in vivo propilin-processing reactions proceed similarly in a single polypeptide cleavage step. Furthermore, TraQ dependence is a property of F-pilin maturation specifically rather than a property of the <b>leader</b> <b>peptide.</b> A propilin derivative with an amino-terminal signal sequence generated by deleting codons 2 to 28 required TraQ for processing in vivo. On the other hand, a chimeric protein with the propilin wild-type <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> fused to the mature portion of beta-lactamase was processed in a TraQ-independent manner. Thus, despite its unusual length, the propilin <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> seems to perform a function {{similar to that of}} the typical amino-terminal signal sequence. This work suggests that TraQ is not necessary for the proteolysis of propilin and therefore is likely to act as a chaperone-like protein that promotes the translocation of propilin...|$|R

However, the <b>leader</b> <b>peptides</b> of these two genera are structurally and functionally unrelated. The aphthovirus leader is a protease involved in viral polyprotein processing and host cell translation shutoff. The function of the cardiovirus <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> is still unknown. To gain an insight into {{the function of the}} cardiovirus <b>leader</b> <b>peptide,</b> a mengovirus <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> deletion mutant was constructed. The deletion mutant was able to grow at a reduced rate in baby hamster kidney cells (BHK- 21). Mutant virus production in mouse fibroblasts (L 929 cells), however, could be demonstrated only after inoculation of BHK- 21 cells with the transfected L 929 cells. Analysis of cellular and viral protein synthesis in mutant virus-infected cells showed a delayed inhibition of host cell protein synthesis and a reduced production of viral proteins. In a single-cycle infection, mutant virus produced only 1 % of wild-type virus yield at 8 h postinfection. Host cell translation shutoff in L 929 cells infected with mutant virus was restored by the addition of the kinase inhibitor 2 -aminopurine. Mutant virus production in 2 -aminopurine-treated L 929 cells was increased to 60 % of wild-type virus yield at 8 h postinfection.

The traA reading frame has been located both genetically and {{by comparing the}} primary structure of F pilin (the traA product) predicted by the DNA sequence to the amino acid composition and sequence of N- and C-terminal peptides isolated from purified F pilin. Taken together, these data {{show that there is}} a leader peptide of 51 amino acids and that F pilin contains 70 amino acids, giving molecular weights of 13, 200 for F propilin and 7, 200 for mature F pilin. Secondary structure predictions for F pilin revealed a reverse turn that precedes the sequence Ala-Met-Ala 51, a classic signal peptidase cleavage site. The N-terminal alanine residue is blocked by an acetyl group as determined by 1 H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The traL and traE genes encode proteins of molecular weights 10, 350 and 21, 200, respectively.

Our approach employed recombinant DNA techniques to construct plasmids with various segments of the gD- 1 and gD- 2 coding sequences fused to the lacZ gene. Such hybrid genes were expressed in a regulated manner in E. coli by joining them to the lac promoter-operator region. Efficient translation of these hybrid genes was facilitated by incorporating a coding sequence specifying a short <b>peptide</b> <b>leader</b> (λcro) in the plasmid expression vectors resulting in synthesis of chimeric Cro-gD-β-galactosidase proteins. In addition, insertion of synthetic translation terminators at the junction of gD and lacZ enabled us to produce specific truncated gD polypeptide sequences unfused to β-galactosidase. The gD antigens produced in E. coli were not glycosylated and were generally recovered as dense insoluble aggregates. Proteins containing portions of gD- 1 or gD- 2 were analyzed by immunoprecipitation using anti-HSV rabbit serum {{and a number of}} monoclonal antibodies recognizing different epitopes of gD- 1. Initial animal studies were done with antigens that reacted with neutralizing antisera or monoclonal antibodies. When these bacterially produced proteins were injected into rabbits, antibodies were produced that specifically immunoprecipitated authentic gD polypeptides and neutralized the infectivity of both virus types. These studies suggest that gene fusion techniques can be used to produce immunogenic proteins in large quantity. These polypeptides are not only useful in analyses of gene structure and function, but also can provide novel diagnostic reagents and well-defined pure antigens for vaccine development...|$|E

In this study a region of 5860 nucleotides from a 12 kb BamHl fragment of cosmid pDUB 1905 was sequenced completely in both directions. Homology searches of this sequence with sequence databases and other computer analysis revealed two flagellar-related genes (flhA and fliR), a chemotactic gene (cheL) and four open reading frames (orfX, orfW, orfY and orfZ) with no significant sequence identity to any open reading frame in databases. A putative promoter-like sequence was also found upstream of orfZ. The FlhA and FliR are the inner members of type III flagellum-specific export apparatus which are responsible for delivering the flagellar subunits lacking a signal <b>peptide</b> <b>leader</b> {{to the surface of}} the cell.

Phenotype analysis of the mutant showed no flagella and motility with small swarming pattern comparing to wild type, indicating that fliR is indeed a flagellar gene.

The trpL 29 mutation, which presumably reduces synthesis of the trp <b>leader</b> <b>peptide,</b> is cis dominant. The effect of starvation {{for a number of}} the amino acids in the trp <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> was determined. Only starvation for tryptophan and arginine, amino acids that occur at residues 10, 11, and 12 of the 14 -residue trp <b>leader</b> <b>peptide,</b> elicits relief of transcription termination. Our findings suggest that translation of trp leader RNA is involved in regulation of transcription termination at the attenuator. A model is discussed in which the location of the ribosome synthesizing the <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> is communicated to the RNA polymerase transcribing the leader region...|$|R
40|$|Killer {{strains of}} Kluyveromyces lactis secrete a toxin which presumably is {{processed}} during secretion {{from a larger}} precursor. Analysis of the sequence of the K. lactis killer toxin gene predicts that the first 16 amino acids at the amino terminus of the protein should represent its <b>leader</b> <b>peptide.</b> We have tested the capability of this <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> to direct secretion of a protein fused to it by inserting a synthetic oligonucleotide identical to the sequence of the putative <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> into a yeast expression vector. Subsequently, the cDNA coding for the secreted active portion of the human interleukin 1 beta (IL- 1 beta) was fused to the <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> sequence of the killer toxin. This construction in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is capable of directing synthesis and secretion of correctly processed IL- 1 beta into the culture medium...|$|R
40|$|The {{erythromycin}} resistance gene ermD, which encodes an rRNA methylase protein, has {{an unusually}} long leader region (354 nucleotides). Previously, a single promoter-proximal <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> coding sequence was recognized from the nucleotide sequence, and erythromycin-induced ribosome stalling in this sequence was proposed {{to be required}} for the induction of methylase translation. We characterized spontaneously occurring and in vitro-constructed leader region mutations {{in an effort to}} understand the function of various segments of the long ermD leader region. A second <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> coding sequence was identified, and the location of insertion and point mutations that expressed ermD methylase constitutively suggested that translation of the second <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> is controlled by ribosome stalling in the first <b>leader</b> <b>peptide.</b> From Northern RNA blot analysis of ermD transcription, it appears that regulation of ermD expression is not by transcriptional attenuation...|$|R
40|$|The cytoplasmically {{synthesized}} {{precursor of}} the mitochondrial matrix enzyme, ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), is targeted to mitochondria by its NH 2 -terminal <b>leader</b> <b>peptide.</b> We previously established through mutational analysis that the midportion of the OTC <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> is functionally required. In this article, {{we report that}} study of additional OTC precursors, altered in either a site-directed or random manner, reveals that (a) the midportion, but not the NH 2 -terminal half, is sufficient by itself to direct import, (b) the functional structure in the midportion {{is unlikely to be}} an amphiphilic alpha-helix, (c) the four arginines in the <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> contribute collectively to import function by conferring net positive charge, and (d) surprisingly, proteolytic processing of the <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> does not require the presence of a specific primary structure at the site of cleavage, in order to produce the mature OTC subunit...|$|R
40|$|The {{function}} of serine protease EpiP in epidermin biosynthesis was investigated. Epidermin is synthesized as a 52 -amino-acid precursor peptide, EpiA, which is posttranslationally modified and processed to the mature 22 -amino-acid peptide antibiotic. epiP was expressed in Staphylococcus carnosus with xylose-regulated expression vector pCX 15. The cleavage of the unmodified EpiA precursor <b>peptide</b> to <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> and proepidermin by EpiP-containing culture filtrates of S. carnosus (pCX 15 epiP) {{was followed by}} reversed-phase chromatography and subsequent electrospray mass spectrometry...|$|R

40|$|Nisin A is a pentacyclic peptide {{antibiotic}} {{produced by}} Lactococcus lactis. The <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> of prenisin keeps nisin inactive {{and has a}} role in inducing NisB- and NisC-catalyzed modifications of the propeptide and NisT-mediated export. The highly specific NisP cleaves off the <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> from fully modified and exported prenisin. We present here a detailed mutagenesis analysis of the nisin <b>leader</b> <b>peptide.</b> For alternative cleavage, we successfully introduced a putative NisP autocleavage site and sites for thrombin, enterokinase, Glu-C, and factor Xa in the C-terminal part of the <b>leader</b> <b>peptide.</b> Replacing residue F- 18 with Trp or Thr strongly reduced production. On the other hand, D- 19 A, F- 18 H, F- 18 M, L- 16 D, L- 16 K, and L- 16 A enhanced production. Substitutions {{within and outside the}} FNLD box enhanced or reduced the transport efficiency. None of the above substitutions nor even an internal 6 His tag from positions − 13 to − 8 had any effect on the capacity of the <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> to induce NisB and NisC modifications. Therefore, these data demonstrate a large mutational freedom. However, simultaneous replacement of the FNLD amino acids by four alanines strongly reduced export and even led to a complete loss of the capacity to induce modifications. Reducing the <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> to MSTKDFNLDLR led to 3 - or 4 -fold dehydration. Taken together, the FNLD box is crucial for inducing posttranslational modifications...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} the <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> in modulating secretion from living cells, we injected a synthetic peptide into Xenopus oocytes. The peptide consisted of the NH 2 -terminal leader sequence of mouse immunoglobulin light chain precursor. We found that the <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> has two different roles in regulating secretion from the oocytes. First, it competitively inhibits the synthesis of secretory and membrane proteins but not of cytoplasmic proteins. The inhibition occurs both with oocyte proteins and with proteins directed by coinjected myeloma mRNA. The inhibition reaches a maximum 2 hr after injection and decays within 3 hr. It appears to be mediated through the cell membrane, because 125 I-labeled <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> segregates into the membrane fraction of microinjected oocytes simultaneously with the interference with methionine incorporation. A second role of the microinjected <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> is to induce a rapid acceleration in the rate of export of secretory proteins from the oocyte. The maximal enhancement effect is obtained upon injection of 50 ng of <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> per oocyte. It is not merely due to the small size, negative charge, or hydrophobicity of the peptide, because enhanced secretion does not occur when glucagon, poly-L-glutamic acid, or Triton X- 100 is injected. Furthermore, immunoreaction of the peptide with specific antibodies prior to microinjection prevents the accelerated export. Our observations indicate that in Xenopus oocytes, the <b>leader</b> <b>peptide</b> is involved in both translocation and later step(s) in the secretory pathway...|$|R
