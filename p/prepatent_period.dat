2500|$|The {{life cycle}} of F. magna is {{relatively}} complex and {{is similar to the}} development of the related fluke, F. hepatica. A detailed account of the F. magna life cycle was given by Swales (1935), Erhardová-Kotrlá (1971), and reviewed by Pybus (2001).Adult flukes occur in pairs or groups within a fibrous [...] in the liver parenchyma of the definitive host. Mature flukes release eggs which are collected in the cavity of the capsule. The capsule contains a great mass of eggs and has duct connections to bile ducts. The eggs are passed together with bile into the bile collecting system, enter the small intestine, and leave the definitive host along with the faeces. The eggs which are passed out in the faeces into the environment are undeveloped and undergo embryonation outside the host. Several physical-chemical factors, especially temperature, humidity and oxygen tension, are known to influence embryonation. During the embryonation of the egg, a larva called a miracidium develops from germinal cells. Fully developed miracidium releases the operculum of the egg using several proteases. The embryonation period varies from 27 to 44 days in natural conditions. Ciliated miracidia hatch in water and actively seek suitable intermediate hosts that are freshwater snails from family Lymnaeidae. After attaching to a suitable snail host, the miracidium penetrates into the snail body. After shedding its ciliated cell layer it is called a sporocyst. The sporocysts are found in the foot, the snail body, digestive glands, reproductive organs, and in the pulmonary sac of the snail. The sporocysts contain germinal cells that give rise to 1-6 mother rediae (a trematode larval form with an oral sucker). Developed mother rediae are released from the sporocyst and migrate into digestive glands, renal organ, reproductive organs, and pulmonary sac of the snail body. Each mother redia can asexually produce up to 10 daughter rediae. However, only 3 to 6 daughter rediae complete their development and leave the mother rediae. In turn, each daughter redia may produce 1-6 Trematode lifecycle stages#Typical lifecyle stagescercariae in experimentally infected snails and 16-22 cercariae under natural conditions. Cercariae emerge from the rediae and mature usually in digestive glands of the snail. Mature cercarie spontaneously emerge from the snail host and swim actively in water for up to two hours before encysting on vegetation. After encystment the flukes are called metacercariae. Development within the snail takes 40 to 69 days depending upon the temperature and the species of snail. The definitive host ingests vegetation containing the metacercariae. In the stomach and the intestine, the metacercariae are stimulated to emerge from the cyst (excystation). Newly excysted juvenile flukes penetrate the wall of the intestine and migrate in the abdominal cavity. Juvenile flukes penetrate the Glisson’s capsule of the liver and continue migrating in the liver tissue. Rarely juvenile flukes penetrate other organs, such as lungs or kidneys. In these organs, however, flukes do not survive and not attain maturity. In the liver, flukes migrate within the parenchyma to search another fluke. If the fluke meet another one, they stop moving, and the fibrous capsule is formed around them. In the capsule, the parasite completes its development and starts egg-laying. <b>Prepatent</b> <b>period</b> varies 3–7 months and is dependent on host species. Adult F. magna can survive in the liver of the host up to 7 years.|$|E

It is not known why the disease has not become established in regions of Canada adjacent to the United States where it is endemic. To assess the vector competence of wild-caught ticks in cattle-rearing regions, Dermacentor variabilis and D. andersoni were collected in western Canada and fed on calves experimentally infected with Anaplasma marginale (St. Maries strain). The 2 tick species were equally competent in transmitting A. marginale to splenectomized calves, all 15 tick-exposed calves becoming infected.

40|$|Abstract. Plasmodium coatneyi has adapted well to {{experimental}} studies with Macaca mulatta monkeys and Anopheles dirus mosquitoes. Studies {{were made to}} determine 1) the course of asexual parasitemia, 2) periods when infective gametocytes were produced, 3) the laboratory-reared mosquitoes susceptible to infection, 4) the mosquito most capable of transmitting the infection to monkeys via bite, 5) the pattern of recrudescence, and 6) the <b>prepatent</b> <b>periods</b> following the bites of infected An. dirus mosquitoes. The period when infective gametocytes are produced is concentrated primarily {{in the first week}} when parasitemia exceeds 1, 000 /l. Mosquitoes were more heavily infected on days when the asexual parasite counts were highest. Gametocyte counts were generally low. Mature forms of the parasite markedly sequestered giving a pattern of high-low periodicity. Anopheles dirus and An. freeborni mosquitoes were nearly equal in terms of their ability to support oocyst development. Other species (An. stephensi, An. maculatus, and An. gambiae,) were less supportive. High sporozoite densities in the salivary glands were frequently produced in An. dirus and sporozoite transmission was obtained via the bites of these mosquitoes after 12 – 18 days of extrinsic incubation. <b>Prepatent</b> <b>periods</b> ranged from 10 to 15 days. The presence of frequent parasitic recrudescences suggests mechanisms similar to that seen in human infections with P. falciparum.

50|$|T. solium eggs {{can cause}} {{cysticercosis}} in humans. Intermediate hosts, which harbor the disease {{for a short}} period of time, include: sheep, horses, cattle, pigs, and deer. Definitive hosts, which harbor the parasite until it reaches maturity and during sexual reproduction, include dogs, foxes, and other canids. The cysticercus, the larval form, travels and persists in the liver for 18 - 30 days, then burrows out into the peritoneal cavity and attaches to the viscera. When the sheep viscera is scavenged and the scavenger ingests the cysticercus, the protoscolex attaches to the small intestinal wall and the worm begins to form proglottids.

50|$|O. ostertagi has {{a direct}} life cycle, which {{consists}} of two stages: the free-living stage on pasture (pre-parasitic) and the parasitic stage in the host (e.g. cattle). Eggs from mature females in the abomasum are passed in the faeces. These eggs hatch in the faecal pat to first stage larvae (L1). The L1 larvae grow and moult to second stage larvae (L2). Subsequently, the L2 larvae moult to become infective third stage larvae (L3). The L3s retain the cuticle from the second stage (L2) as a protective sheath, and can survive for long periods within the faecal pat. The time taken to develop into infective larvae is dependent on favourable stimuli such as temperature (approximately 25-27 °C) and humidity. Typically, development takes 10 days to 2 weeks. The parasitic stage {{of the life cycle}} begins when warm moist conditions cause the L3 larvae to migrate onto herbage surrounding the fecal pat, which are ingested during grazing. In the rumen the L3 larvae shed their protective sheath and pass into the abomasum where they penetrate the gastric glands. After exsheathment and penetration into the gastric glands the L3 moult into L4 and subsequently to L5 larvae. The young adult worms then emerge from the gastric glands and continue their maturation on the mucosal surface of the abomasum. Once fully mature sexual reproduction begins and eggs are produced, thus completing the life cycle.The normal <b>prepatent</b> <b>period</b> for O. ostertagi is 21 days. However, under certain circumstances, ingested L3 larvae can suspend their maturation and become dormant as inhibited L4 larvae inside the gastric glands. This arrested development is called hypobiosis, and can last for up to six or seven months. Clearly, when arrested development occurs the <b>prepatent</b> <b>period</b> will be prolonged. Studies suggest that the inhibition process in O. ostertagi depends on the weather conditions to which the infective L3 larvae are exposed on pasture, and the length of time that L3 larvae spend on pasture. In temperate regions of the Northern hemisphere, hypobiosis occurs in autumn and early winter, but in the Southern hemisphere there is evidence that this phenomenon occurs in spring and early summer.|$|E
50|$|The {{life cycle}} of T. suis is direct and does not require any {{intermediate}} host. Eggs are passed in feces from infected animals, but are single-celled and are not initially infectious. Infective J1 stage larvae develop within the shell in 3 weeks to 2 months, depending on environmental temperature. The infective J1 stage within the egg is highly resistant and can remain in this form for several years in favorable conditions. Once the infective J1 egg is ingested, the bipolar plugs are digested and the J1 larvae hatch in the small intestine and cecum. The J1 larvae penetrate the mucosa via the crypts of Lieberkühn in the distal ileum, cecum, and colon. During the next 5 weeks, the larvae undergo four molts (J2, J3, J4) to the adult stage (J5) within the mucosal layers. The adult’s thicker posterior one-third then emerges through the mucosal surface into the lumen while the thin anterior two-thirds remains embedded in the mucosal layers. Adults can be recovered anywhere from the distal ileum to the rectum, but most {{are located in the}} cecum and proximal colon. The <b>prepatent</b> <b>period</b> is 6 to 8 weeks and life span is 4 to 5 months.|$|E
40|$|A {{review of}} the life history of Plasmodium malariae, the quartan malaria {{parasite}} of humans, is presented. Much of the information is based on data obtained from induced infections in humans who were given malaria therapy {{for the treatment of}} neurosyphilis between 1940 and 1963. <b>Prepatent</b> <b>periods</b> (i. e., the time until the first day of parasite detection) fever episodes, and maximum parasitemias as a result of infection with P. malariae were obtained and are presented. Experimental and known vectors of the parasite are also discussed. Splenectomized chimpanzees and New World monkeys are readily infected and serve as sources of parasites and antigens for diagnostic and molecular studies. South American monkeys are naturally infected with a parasite known as Plasmodium brasilianum. This parasite appears to be P. malariae that has adapted from humans to grow in monkeys, probably within the last 500 years. Infection with P. malariae is associated with the production of immune complexes in the kidneys and the associated nephrotic syndrome. The essential lesions are a thickening of the glomerular basement membrane and endocapillary cell proliferation. Studies of monkeys infected with P. malariae indicate the same pathology as that demonstrated in humans...|$|R

50|$|Routine {{anthelmintic}} treatments, {{commonly used}} in intensive pig rearing systems, are not systematic and treatment schemes vary according to farm and animal category. The breeding stock is usually treated with 3-4 month intervals or prior to farrowing. (Roepstorff and Nansen, 1994). Piglets are typically treated upon entering the fattening units and maybe once more halfway the fattening period. However, these treatment schemes seem to be unable to significantly decrease the infection intensity on a farm. Treatment frequency {{must be based on}} the <b>prepatent</b> <b>period</b> of the worm species. For Ascaris this is 42 days. However, when anthelmintic treatment is ineffective i/n killing the migrating larval stages, it is possible that egg shedding occurs earlier as larvae remain in the lung up to 10 days post infection (Roepstorff et al., 1997). Treatment of pigs every 5 weeks would therefore eliminate the worms before they are able to produce millions of eggs and contaminate the environment all over again. When a strict deworming process is applied, the infectivity of the environment will drop, as new hosts will take up eggs from the environment, and eggs will be swept away by cleaning actions or eventually lose their viability. This will ultimately result in a stock of pigs with a reduced or absent parasitic burden. It is important to understand that persistence in the repeated application of the anthelmintic is necessary. If the environmental contamination is high, it will most likely take several fattening rounds to eventually reduce the infection pressure (Bakker, 1984; Jourquin, 2007).Both the fact that infections usually seem to occur in the fattening units and the fact that anthelmintic treatment has limited persistent activity against recurring infectious larvae lead to believe that the common practice of treating pigs prior to, or upon arrival in the fattening units, might be superfluous. In two experiments, {{it has been reported that}} a single anthelmintic treatment of fatteners at the start of the fattening period is not justified on economie grounds. It showed to be ineffective in reducing parasite prevalence and it did not have a positive effect on performance results, nor did it influence the incidence of other lesions like white spots (Boes et al., 2010; Nilsson, 1982; Roepstorff and Jorsal, 1990). More importantly, Roepstorff (1997) showed that, depending on the infection status, it might sometimes be more economically beneficial to switch from a routine anthelmintic treatment program to the conditional usage of anthelmintics, treating only when parasite levels reach an unacceptable level. This should however be supported by routine diagnostic screening of pigs from different age categories and is probably only applicable to farms with moderate to highly intensive management.|$|E
50|$|The {{life cycle}} of F. magna is {{relatively}} complex and {{is similar to the}} development of the related fluke, F. hepatica. A detailed account of the F. magna life cycle was given by Swales (1935), Erhardová-Kotrlá (1971), and reviewed by Pybus (2001).Adult flukes occur in pairs or groups within a fibrous capsule in the liver parenchyma of the definitive host. Mature flukes release eggs which are collected in the cavity of the capsule. The capsule contains a great mass of eggs and has duct connections to bile ducts. The eggs are passed together with bile into the bile collecting system, enter the small intestine, and leave the definitive host along with the faeces. The eggs which are passed out in the faeces into the environment are undeveloped and undergo embryonation outside the host. Several physical-chemical factors, especially temperature, humidity and oxygen tension, are known to influence embryonation. During the embryonation of the egg, a larva called a miracidium develops from germinal cells. Fully developed miracidium releases the operculum of the egg using several proteases. The embryonation period varies from 27 to 44 days in natural conditions. Ciliated miracidia hatch in water and actively seek suitable intermediate hosts that are freshwater snails from family Lymnaeidae. After attaching to a suitable snail host, the miracidium penetrates into the snail body. After shedding its ciliated cell layer it is called a sporocyst. The sporocysts are found in the foot, the snail body, digestive glands, reproductive organs, and in the pulmonary sac of the snail. The sporocysts contain germinal cells that give rise to 1-6 mother rediae (a trematode larval form with an oral sucker). Developed mother rediae are released from the sporocyst and migrate into digestive glands, renal organ, reproductive organs, and pulmonary sac of the snail body. Each mother redia can asexually produce up to 10 daughter rediae. However, only 3 to 6 daughter rediae complete their development and leave the mother rediae. In turn, each daughter redia may produce 1-6 Trematode lifecycle stages#Typical lifecyle stagescercariae in experimentally infected snails and 16-22 cercariae under natural conditions. Cercariae emerge from the rediae and mature usually in digestive glands of the snail. Mature cercarie spontaneously emerge from the snail host and swim actively in water for up to two hours before encysting on vegetation. After encystment the flukes are called metacercariae. Development within the snail takes 40 to 69 days depending upon the temperature and the species of snail. The definitive host ingests vegetation containing the metacercariae. In the stomach and the intestine, the metacercariae are stimulated to emerge from the cyst (excystation). Newly excysted juvenile flukes penetrate the wall of the intestine and migrate in the abdominal cavity. Juvenile flukes penetrate the Glisson’s capsule of the liver and continue migrating in the liver tissue. Rarely juvenile flukes penetrate other organs, such as lungs or kidneys. In these organs, however, flukes do not survive and not attain maturity. In the liver, flukes migrate within the parenchyma to search another fluke. If the fluke meet another one, they stop moving, and the fibrous capsule is formed around them. In the capsule, the parasite completes its development and starts egg-laying. <b>Prepatent</b> <b>period</b> varies 3-7 months and is dependent on host species. Adult F. magna can survive in the liver of the host up to 7 years.|$|E
40|$|Naturally {{acquired}} immunity to Plasmodium falciparum's asexual blood stage reduces parasite multiplication at microscopically detectable densities. The effect of natural immunity on initial prepatent parasite multiplication {{during the period}} following a new infection has been uncertain, contributing to doubt regarding the utility of experimental challenge models for blood-stage vaccine trials. Here we present data revealing that parasite multiplication rates during the initial <b>prepatent</b> <b>period</b> in semi-immune Gambian adults are substantially lower than in malaria-naive participants. This supports the view that a blood-stage vaccine capable of emulating the disease-reducing effect of natural immunity could achieve a detectable effect during the <b>prepatent</b> <b>period...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{method to}} purify trypanosomastigotes of some strains of Trypanosoma cruzi (Y, CL, FL, F, "Berenice", "Colombiana" and "São Felipe") from mouse blood by using DEAE-cellulose columns was standardized. This {{procedure}} is {{a modification of}} the Lanham & Godfrey methods and differs in some aspects from others described to purify T. cruzi bloodstream trypomastigotes, mainly by avoidance of prior purifications of parasites. By this method, the broad trypomastigotes were mainly isolated, accounting for higher recoveries obtained with strains having higher percentages of these forms: processing of infected blood from irradiated mice could be advantageous by increasing the recovery of parasites (percentage and/or total number) and elution of more slender trypomastigotes. Trypomastigotes purified by this method presented normal morphology and motility, remained infective to triatomine bugs and mice, showing in the latter <b>prepatent</b> <b>periods</b> and courses parasitemia {{similar to those of}} control parasites, and also reproducing the polymorphism pattern of each strain. Their virulence and pathogenicity also remained considerably preserved, the latter property being evaluated by LD 50 tests, mortality rates and mean survival time of inoculated mice. Moreover, these parasites presented positive, clear and peripheral immunofluorescence reaction at titres similar to those of control organisms, thus suggesting important preservation of their surface antigens...|$|R
40|$|International audienceExperimental infections of two South American lymnaeid populations with Fascioloides magna {{were carried}} out to {{determine}} whether these snails may sustain larval development of this digenean and, if so, to quantify their potential for cercarial production. The reference group was a French population of Galba truncatula infected and raised according to the same protocol. According to the internal transcribed sequence (ITS) - 1 segment of their genomic rDNA, these South American populations were identified as Lymnaea neotropica (origin, Argentina) and Lymnaea viatrix var. ventricosa (origin, Uruguay). In the snail groups followed for cercarial shedding, longer <b>prepatent</b> <b>periods</b> and lower numbers of shed cercariae were noted in South American lymnaeids. In other snails dissected at day 65 post-exposure, the redial and cercarial burdens of F. magna found in the bodies of L. neotropica and L. v. ventricosa were significantly lower than those noted in G. truncatula. Compared to the total cercarial production noted in the dissected snails, the percentage of cercariae that exited from snails was 51. 3 % for G. truncatula, 32. 2 % for L. neotropica and 46. 8 % for L. v. ventricosa. The two South American species of snails can thus be considered as potential intermediate hosts of F. magna...|$|R
40|$|An age-dependent {{aspect of}} {{resistance}} to Cryptosporidium muris (strain MCR) infection was monitored in Syrian golden hamsters, Mesocricetus auratus, at 1 -, 5 - and 10 -week of age and in ICR mice, Mus musculus, at 3 -, 12 -, and 15 -week of age orally inoculated with a single dose of 2 × 106 oocysts, respectively. The <b>prepatent</b> <b>periods</b> for both animals were similar, independent of age, but the patency was significantly longer in younger hamsters (P< 0. 001) and a long tendency in younger mice. Hamsters infected at 1 -week of age excreted about 10 times higher oocysts than those at 5 - and 10 -week of age. However, the total oocyst output was similar among mice of different ages. There was a good correlation between {{the length of the}} patency and the total oocyst output in hamsters (R= 0. 9646), but not in mice (R= 0. 4561). The immunogenicity of the parasite to homologous challenge infections was very strong in hamsters and relatively strong in mice. These results indicate that acquired resistance to C. muris infection is age-related and the innate resistance is independent of age of hamsters, and that both innate and acquired resistance, on the contrary, are irrespective of age of mice...|$|R
