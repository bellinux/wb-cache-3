40|$|Background Similar to the {{situation}} in other tumour types, it is currently unclear whether fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) is adequate in the detection of bone metastases of thyroid cancer. The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the performance of bone scans in comparison with FDG PET in the detection of bone metastases in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). Materials and methods Twenty-four patients had undergone both FDG PET and bone scans within 6 months because of suspected bone metastases. All scans were re-evaluated using all available additional imaging and clinical data for verification. Scan findings were scored as <b>positive,</b> negative <b>or</b> <b>doubtful.</b> <b>Results</b> Bone metastases were present in eight of 24 (33 %) patients. Only bone scintigraphy but not FDG PET suggested the presence of bone metastases in three patients, all confirmed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) /X-ray. Five patients were identified with bone metastases on both bone scan and FDG PET, which was confirmed by computed tomography (CT) /MRI/X-ray in four. Five patients had doubtful findings on bone scans whereas FDG PET scans were negative. MRI showed degenerative disorders in two of five and was normal in two. Eleven patients had both a negative bone scan and FDG PET scan. Conclusion In three of eight (38 %) thyroid cancer patients bone metastases were only identified on bone scans. Therefore, bone scans are still valuable in detecting bone metastases in patients with DTC and can not be replaced by FDG PET.

40|$|Abstract Objective: This paper, {{conducted}} on 1495 couples in preconceptional period, demonstrates how {{the study of}} Globular resistance of erythrocytes (GRO) is not a first choice test and not useful as other more accurate tests to identify subjects with beta thalassemia trait. Instead, the complete blood count (CBC) and the evaluation of HbA, HbA 2 and HbF by High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) are essential. Methods: Each couple arrived in our laboratory to screen for beta thalassemia. In case of patients with <b>positive</b> (240) <b>or</b> <b>doubtful</b> (112) <b>results,</b> we studied beta globin gene. Results: Of the 2990 subjects examined, we found 280 subjects with beta-thalassemia trait (9, 36 %). During biochemical tests, among 112 subjects <b>resulted</b> <b>doubtful</b> (GRO normal <b>or</b> altered); 40 of them resulted positive for the molecular analysis, while 72 of them didn't show mutations in beta globin genes. The 2710 samples non-carriers of beta thalassemia trait, presented as mean evaluation of HbA 2 2, 6 %, while the 280 subjects with beta thalassemia trait presented as mean evaluation of HbA 2 4, 8 %. Molecular study showed that the β thalassemia phenotype {{is caused by a}} small number of mutation, whose regional distribution is typically. Conclusions: In the presence of thalassemic parameters in the CBC, the accurate and precise quantification of hemoglobin HbA 2 is essential for the diagnosis of β-thalassemia trait. DNA mutation analysis provides the most effective way in which to detect primary gene mutations. The mutations identified in this work can be identified with a simple and inexpensive kit.

40|$|In 1953 the metachromatic {{reaction}} of urine (abbrevi a ted to MR) was discovered and designated by Nagata and Yamamoto. Since then {{studies on the}} MR {{have been carried out}} by their coworkers and the number of their reports has already totalled to dozens. This paper deals with the results of studies which have recently been made on the physiochemical effects on the MR. As material, the uri n e specimens of healthy persons and patients with urogenital disease were used. The urine specimens were subjected to the MR test. The MR test was performed on the same urine specimens after such physio-chemical procedures as heating, cooling, infrared ray irradiation, ultra-violet ray irradiation, x-ray irradiation, centrifugation, desiccation by refrigeration, treatment with absorbents and ion exchange resins and dialysis. The results of the MR test were compared with those obtained before the procedures were performed. The results were interpreted macroscopically after the manner of Nagata and Yamamoto. A part of the results was interpreted colorimetrically according to the method of Yamamoto et al. Results : 1) The effects of intrared ray irradiation. While intrared ray irradiatio n for 60 - 120 minutes produced no special change in the results of the MR test on the urine specimens which developed the negative MR, the urine specimens which showed <b>positive</b> <b>or</b> <b>doubtful</b> <b>positive</b> <b>results</b> to the MR test were negative in 4 out of the. 5 cases and doubtful positive in 1. 2) The effects of ultraviolet ray irradiation. In the case of ultraviolet ray i rradiation there was no change in the results of the MR test on the urine of all the cases, regardless of the time of irradiation. 3) The effects of x-ray irradiation When the urine speci m ens were irradiated with x-rays, there occurred no change in the results of the MR test on all the cases, irrespective of the time and dosage of irradiation. 4) The effects of temperature. The urine speci m ens which showed positive and <b>doubtful</b> positive <b>results</b> to the MR test rendered the MR negative when they were heated to 100 °C for 60 minutes. There was no change in the results of the MR test on the other urine specimens that were negative. On heating at 90 °C for 60 minutes, the MR-positive urine specimens of 3 cases were negative in all the 3 cases; the MR-doubtful positive urine specimens of 2 cases were negative in 1 of the 2 cases; the MR-negative urine specimens of 2 cases were negative in 1 out of the 2 cases. At a low temperature of 0 ° to. 40 °C, there was no change in the results of the MR test, irrespective of the number of cooling days. 5) The effects of centrifugation and desiccation by refrigeration Centrifugation at 3000 - 5000 rpm caused no change in the results of the MR test on the urine specimens of all the cases. There was no change in the results of the MR test on the urine specimens which were allowed to stand at room temperature for 6 months after they were frozen to dryness. 6) The effects of absorbents. The MR-positive urine spe c imens were absorbed in to silica and activated charcoal and showed negative results to the MR test. However, there was no change in the MR test on the negative urine specimens. 7) The effects of ion exchange resins. IRA- 400 and IRC- 50 rendered the MR of the MR-positive urine specimens doubtful positive, while the negative urine specimens were caused by IR- 120 and IRA- 400 to show positive results to the MR test. 8) The effects of dialysis. Positive results were obtained by dialysis in the greater part of 312 healthy persons and patients. Though dialysis brought about a marked decrease in or a disappearance of electrolytes, changes in the electrolytes did not influence the results of the MR test. Colorimetery {{of the results of the}} MR test after dialysis revealed a movement toward the left lower part from the original point of the CIE chromaticity diagram. This was due to a decrease in purity and an increase in luminocity. The MR-positive urine specimens also showed the same tendency, which was particularly remarkable in the MRnegative urine specimens. In such a case the results of the MR test cannot be interpreted macroscopically and therefore a colorimetric method seems to be the only one used for that interpretation...|$|R

From May 1991 to June 1995, 308 arteries have been registered from 136 donors: 122 brain death cases and 14 cadavers (mean age 34 years, male/female ratio 1. 52 / 1); 263 arteries were cryopreserved (113 aortas, 64 aortic bifurcations, and 86 femoral); 19 were discarded for atherosclerosis (6. 7 %); 10 batches of arteries were partially or totally discarded because of persistent contamination and further eight batches for <b>positive</b> <b>or</b> <b>doubtful</b> viral serology. One hundred patients were treated in nine European centers with one (N = 69) or more EHB homografts. Indications were: infected prosthesis 70 (17 with aortoenteric fistula); mycotic aneurysm 19 (four ascending aortas, two with bronchial fistula); neoplastic infiltration of subrenal aorta one; extracardiac reconstructions/shunts 10. Results from homograft reconstructions in infected prosthesis or mycotic aneurysm were available in 90 patients. There were 19 early deaths and 24 early complications, three were directly graft-related and included a fatal case of homograft rupture. Sixty-seven vascular cases were followed up from 1 month onward (mean: 16 months) : 50 were uneventful; there were nine late deaths, of which two resulted from graft-related digestive hemorrhage; there were eight cases of late complications; three arteries were partly explanted {{as a result of}} focal thrombosis. Four patients were lost to follow-up. In the cases of aortoenteric fistula, however, the results were disappointing with only five late survivors of the 16 treated patients. Finally, these results show that cryopreserved arteries seem to perform as well in the midterm as the fresh ones. Both the banking activity of cryopreserved homografts and the short- to mid-term performances of the implants in cases of prosthetic or native arterial infection are very satisfactory, provided no aortoenteric fistula is present. Cryopreserved arteries can also be used for extracardiac shunts and reconstructions. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to ascertain the epidemiology, together with effects of bovine tuberculosis, on certain haematological parameters and serum proteins at two Livestock Experiment Stations in Pakistan. The results on prevalence of tuberculosis in buffaloes on the basis of comparative intradermal tuberculin test revealed it to be from as high as 8. 48 % (14 / 165) to as low as 2. 45 % (4 / 163) on the basis of positive reaction to bovine PPD. However, a doubtful reaction was observed in 8. 58 % (14 / 163) of buffaloes at farm 2 with low prevalence. It was also observed that the reaction to bovine or avian PPD was much stronger in buffaloes compared with indigenous cattle. The result on certain epidemiological factors studies revealed higher positive reactors of greater than 6 years of age and the majority were between 6 - 8 years old (P = 0. 03). Results also revealed that a significantly higher number of animals had a body mass of less than 550 kg (P = 0. 005), had less than three parturitions (P = 0. 001) and milk production of 5 - 7 litres. The number of animals present at the farm, number of species, the nearby village, etc., {{played a significant role in}} the prevalence of the disease, rather than the condition of the farm.

Increasingly, molecular markers in bronchial washings are being investigated to improve the diagnostic yield. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the diagnostic value of the Ras association domain family 1 A gene (RASSF 1 A) methylation analysis in washings in nondiagnostic bronchoscopy in the analysis of patients with suspected lung cancer who had peripheral tumors. Furthermore, the additional diagnostic value of Kirsten rat sarcoma 2 viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutations with RASSF 1 methylation was analyzed. METHODS: From a prospectively collected series, 129 patients with lung cancer and 28 control subjects were analyzed retrospectively regarding the methylation status of the promoter region of the RASSF 1 A gene by quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction and KRAS point mutations by using the sensitive Point-EXACCT method. RESULTS: A total of 40 % of the lung cancer patients had peripheral tumors, and 17 patients had a nondiagnostic bronchoscopy. In these patients, RASSF 1 A methylation was detected in the washings of four patients (24 %), and KRAS mutations were detected in the washings of two patients (12 %). In total, 29 % of the false-negative <b>or</b> <b>doubtful</b> cytology <b>results</b> were accompanied by RASSF 1 A methylation or KRAS mutation results that were highly suggestive of malignancy.

The negative cases were confirmed by pathology in four cases, peroperative ultrasonography in 12 cases, and follow-up in 17 cases. Whole-body FDG PET was compared to CT (n = 53) and US (n = 43). RESULTS: PET demonstrated a 97 % sensitivity, an 88 % specificity and a 92 % accuracy, compared to 93 %, 75 % and 85 %, respectively, for CT (P = NS). Concordant results were obtained in 44 of 64 patients (69 %: 19 TP. 25 TN). PET provided new and accurate information in 15 of 64 patients (23. 4 %). PET demonstrated liver metastases in 11 patients in whom conventional methods yielded negative (two cases) <b>or</b> <b>doubtful</b> (nine cases) <b>results.</b> Four patients free of liver involvement were correctly staged with PET, while CT/US were equivocal. PET was erroneous in five of 64 cases (7. 8 %, four FP, one FN). CONCLUSIONS: FDG PET allows an accurate screening of liver involvement in patients with malignancy. Combined with CT, it provides additional diagnostic information that could directly affect the management of these patients. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|A new {{fragrance}} mix (FM II), with 6 {{frequently used}} chemicals {{not present in}} the currently used fragrance mix (FM I), was evaluated in 6 dermatological centres in Europe, as previously reported. In this publication, test results with the individual constituents and after repeated open application test (ROAT) of FM II are described. Furthermore, cosmetic products which had caused a contact dermatitis in patients were analysed {{for the presence of}} the individual constituents. In 1701 patients, the individual constituents of the medium (14 %) and the highest (28 %) concentration of FM II were simultaneously applied with the new mix at 3 concentrations (break-down testing for the lowest concentration of FM II (2. 8 %) was performed only if the mix was positive). ROAT was performed with the concentration of the FM II which had produced a <b>positive</b> <b>or</b> <b>doubtful</b> (+ <b>or</b> ?+) patch test reaction. Patients' products were analysed for the 6 target compounds by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Results: 50 patients (2. 9 %) showed a positive reaction to 14 % FM II and 70 patients (4. 1 %) to 28 % FM II. 24 / 50 (48 %) produced a positive reaction to 1 or more of the individual constituents of 14 % FM II and 38 / 70 (54. 3 %) to 28 % FM II, respectively. If doubtful reactions to individual constituents are included, the break-down testing was positive in 74 % and 70 %, respectively. Patients with a positive reaction to 14 % FM II showed a higher rate of reactions to the individual constituent of the 28 % FM II: 36 / 50 (72 %). Positive reactions to individual constituents in patients negative to FM II were exceedingly rare. If doubtful reactions are regarded as negative, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for the medium concentration of FM II towards at least 1 individual constituent was 92. 3 % (exact 95 % confidence interval 74. 9 - 99. 1 %), 98. 4 % (97. 7 - 99. 0 %), 48 % (33. 7 - 62. 6 %) and 99. 9 % (99. 6 -" 100. 0 %), respectively. For the high concentration, the figures were very similar. The frequency of positive reactions to the individual constituents in descending order was the same for both FM II concentrations: hydroxyisohexyl 3 -cyclohexene carboxaldehyde (Lyral((R))) > citral > farnesol > citronellol > alpha-hexyl-cinnamic aldehyde (AHCA). No unequivocally positive reaction to coumarin was observed. Lyral((R)) was the dominant individual constituent, with positive reactions in 36 % of patients reacting to 14 % FM II and 37. 1 % to 28 % FM II. 5 / 11 patients developed a positive ROAT after a median of 7 days (range 2 - 10). The 5 patients with a <b>doubtful</b> <b>or</b> negative reaction to 28 % FM II were all ROAT negative except 1. There were 7 patients with a certain fragrance history and a positive reaction to either 28 % or 14 % FM II but a negative reaction to FM I. Analysis with GC-MS in a total of 24 products obtained from 12 patients showed at least 1 - 5 individual constituents per product: Lyral((R)) (79. 2 %), citronellol (87. 5 %), AHCA (58. 3 %), citral (50 %) and coumarin (50 %). The patients were patch test positive to Lyral((R)), citral and AHCA. In conclusion, patients with a certain fragrance history and a negative reaction to FM I can be identified by FM II. Testing with individual constituents is positive in about 50 % of cases reacting to either 14 % or 28 % FM II...|$|R
40|$|URL] The major {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) {{is a set of}} genes found on the short arm of chromosome 6. MHC molecules in human beings are known as human leukocyte antigens (HLA). HLA polymorphism can be determined by serological and molecular typing methods, which may yield discordant results. The present analysis performed HLA typing of samples with discordant results by PCR-SSP and PCR-SSO, so that typing discrepancies could be clarified. The cross-sectional study analyzed 33 samples from individuals included in an HLA-disease association study. Discrepant alleles were observed in 6 of 33 samples. Discordant samples were retyped using One Lambda Micro SSP™, Dynal RELI™ SSO and Luminex™ SSO assays for HLA class I (HLA-A, HLA-B) and class II (HLA-DRB 1) molecules. The three methods produced concordant results after HLA retyping. Human error occurred in interpreting the initial results, which led to discrepancies in the results obtained. The participation of experienced professionals and the availability of at least two different methods to confirm <b>doubtful</b> <b>or</b> inconclusive <b>results</b> are mandatory for effective HLA typing...|$|R
