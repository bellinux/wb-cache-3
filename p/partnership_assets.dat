25|$|John Buchanan (1855–96) {{was first}} apprenticed to a {{gardener}} at Drummond Castle. He {{was one of}} the original employees of the Blantyre Church of Scotland Mission when it was founded in 1876, working as a gardener, and in 1878 moved to open an outstation of the mission on the Mulunguzi River, which became the site of Zomba, the capital of Nyasaland. He was dismissed by the mission in 1881 for brutality, but by this time he had exchanged low-value trade goods for around 170,000 acres of land. This land was acquired in the name of Buchanan Brothers, a partnership of him and his two younger brothers David and Robert, who joined him in Central Africa in 1881. These land deals were probably made in the expectation that, with more settlers, land prices would rise. Buchanan also acted as broker for non-residents wishing to buy land, including Alexander Low Bruce, whose land formed the A L Bruce Estates. Buchanan Brothers experimented with a number of crops starting with coffee, which was being exported by 1891. In early 1890s, they had introduced Virginia-type tobacco, planted an experimental tea garden and built a sugar mill to produce sugar for the local market. From being a disgraced missionary, John Buchanan became Acting British Consul to Central Africa from 1887 to 1891, and in that capacity declared a protectorate over the Shire Highlands in 1889 to pre-empt a Portuguese expedition that intended to claim sovereignty in that region. In 1891, this became part of the British Central Africa Protectorate. In 1892, he helped to form the Nyasaland Planters Association, which mainly represented the interests of Buchanan Brothers and the African Lakes Company. In 1895, this fused with a rival association to form the British Central Africa Chamber of Agriculture and Commerce, a powerful lobby group for settler interests. John Buchanan was the first Chairman, but he died suddenly early in 1896 and was succeeded by his brother Robert, who died a few months later. David Buchanan had already died in 1892. There were other family members, but none were resident in British Central Africa or involved in the business. After the deaths of the three Buchanan brothers, the Buchanan Brothers Company was formed to take over the <b>partnership</b> <b>assets,</b> and it was run by a local manager until 1901.|$|E

50|$|While France, Luxembourg, Norway, the Czech Republic and Sweden also grant {{some degree}} of legal {{personality}} to business partnerships, other countries such as Belgium, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and Poland do not allow partnerships to acquire a separate legal personality, but permit partnerships the rights to sue and be sued, to hold property, and to postpone a creditor's lawsuit against the partners until {{he or she has}} exhausted all remedies against the <b>partnership</b> <b>assets.</b>|$|E
50|$|The UPA and RUPA provide {{rules as}} to {{many aspects of}} a {{partnership}} relationship including formation, the ownership of <b>partnership</b> <b>assets,</b> the assessment of fiduciary duties, the settlement of partnership disputes, and termination.

RUPA is significantly more detailed than is the UPA as to {{the degree to which}} the partnership agreement may modify the default rules set forth in the statute.

5000|$|Aggregate ConceptAn {{aggregate}} concept {{looks at}} a partnership {{as a collection of}} partners and treats each partner as if he owned an undivided interest in the <b>partnership</b> <b>assets</b> and its operations. For tax purposes, under this concept, a partnership is not a person, it cannot be sued or sue. It is merely a conduit passing income through to the partners for reporting on their individual tax returns. [...] "The aggregate approach reflects the underlying notion that the partnership form generally should affect the tax treatment of the partners as little as possible. Thus it is useful to compare the treatment of a similar non-partnership transaction under general income tax principles." ...|$|E
50|$|To {{protect the}} non-debtor {{partners}} from the creditor of the debtor-partner {{it was necessary}} to keep the creditor from seizing <b>partnership</b> <b>assets</b> (which was also in line with the developing perception of partnerships as legal entities and not simple aggregates of partners) and to keep the creditor out of partnership affairs. These objectives could only be accomplished by limiting the collection remedies that creditors previously enjoyed. The rationale behind the charging order applied initially only to general partnerships, where every partner was involved in carrying on the business of the partnership; it did not apply to corporations because of their centralized management structure. However, over the years the charging order protection was extended to limited partners and LLC members.|$|E
5000|$|Before {{the advent}} of the {{charging}} order, a creditor pursuing a partner in a partnership was able to obtain from the court a writ of execution directly against the partnership’s assets, which led to the seizure of such assets by the sheriff. This result was possible because the partnership itself was not treated as a juridical person, but simply as an aggregate of its partners. The seizure of <b>partnership</b> <b>assets</b> was usually carried out by the sheriff, who would go down to the partnership’s place of business and shut it down. That caused the non-debtor partners to suffer financial losses, sometimes on par with the debtor partner, and the process was considered to be entirely “clumsy.” ...|$|E

He explained that Sanborn stock sold for only $45 per share in 1958, but the company's investment portfolio was worth $65 per share. This meant that Sanborn's map business was being valued at [...] "minus $20." [...] Buffett eventually purchased 23% of the company's outstanding shares as an activist investor, obtaining a seat for himself on the Board of Directors, and allied with other dissatisfied shareholders to control 44% of the shares.

5000|$|Distinction between Book and Tax Capital Accounts.Generally, partners' book capital {{accounts}} reflect {{the value of}} each partner's interest in the partnership. Thus, {{capital accounts}} serve to reconcile the entitlements and obligations of the partners upon liquidation. For example, if all <b>partnership</b> <b>assets</b> were sold for a fair market value and all liabilities were paid, the remaining cash, if any, would be equal to the partner's equity in the partnership at fair market value. Tax capital accounts are partners' [...] "Outside Basis" [...] (however, unlike outside basis, the partnership's recourse and nonrecourse liabilities {{are not included in}} partners' tax-basis capital accounts) and under Section 722 are initially determined by reference to the partner's contributed cash amount and the adjusted basis of the contributed property. Thereafter, other allocations that either increase or decrease a partner's basis will be reflected in the account. A partner's 'outside basis' is separate and distinct from the partnership's 'inside basis'. Under Section 723, a partnership's 'inside basis' is the adjusted basis of the contributed property or the value of the contributed cash. [...] "Generally the sum of the partner's outside basis will equal to the partnership's inside basis in its assets".|$|E

50|$|To {{determine}} each partner's {{economic risk}} of loss, a constructive liquidation analysis must be performed. The $100,000 note is deemed to become due. The <b>partnership's</b> <b>assets</b> become worthless and are sold for no consideration. This {{results in a}} $120,000 loss to the partnership, which is split equally between A and B. As a result of each A and B taking a $60,000 distributive share of the loss, their respective capital accounts are decreased by $60,000 from $10,000 to ($50,000). To restore these negative capital account balances to $0.00 in a deemed liquidation of their partnership interests, A and B would have to contribute $50,000 each to the partnership. Hence, each A and B bears the economic risk of loss for $50,000 of the partnership's recourse debt. A and B's outside bases, therefore, are increased by $50,000 from $10,000 when AB becomes obligated on the $100,000 note, giving each partner an outside basis of $60,000.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of taxes on the {{equilibrium}} ownership structure of productive assets. Ownership structure includes the traditional choice between debt and equity financing, but also the larger choice between corporate and partnership forms. A key feature of these alternative forms is that corporations are subject to taxation at both the corporate and investor levels, whereas partnerships are not. At the same time, depreciation and interest tax shields are taken at the corporate tax rate for corporate assets and at investors' tax rates for <b>partnership</b> <b>assets.</b> We find that assets endowed with excess non-interest tax deductions are best held in partnership form by high tax bracket investors. Assets whose allowed deductions are low enough to generate a net tax liability in corporate formare best held as partnerships by low tax bracket investors. All other assets are held in the corporate sector and are financed {{in a manner consistent}} with Miller's(1977) capital structure equilibrium. We argue that our analysis illuminates the tax aspects of such transactionsas mergers and sales or spin-offs of corporate assets to partnerships and royalty trusts.

40|$|JEL No. H 2 This paper {{explores the}} effect of {{discretion}} in estate valuation techniques on the effective estate tax burden on different asset classes. For some assets, such as liquid securities, there is relatively little discretion in valuation. For other assets, such as partial interests in closely-held businesses, family limited partnerships, and real assets or collectibles that are traded in thin markets, estate valuations may {{be more difficult to}} establish. Estate tax filers may therefore be able to select valuations that reduce the reported value of the estate assets, and therefore the effective estate tax burden. In 1998, estates that invoked the doctrine of &quot;minority discounts &quot; in valuing non-controlling interests in limited partnerships claimed an average discount of 36 percent for these assets, relative to their estimated market value. More than half of all limited <b>partnership</b> <b>assets</b> reported on estate tax returns were valued using this doctrine. This suggests that for a given statutory estate tax rate, the effective estate tax burden may be greater on assets that are easily valued than on difficult-to-value assets.

GAO found that FDIC has several internal control weaknesses related to financial reporting, including the execution of transactions. The weaknesses concern its asset valuation process and its allocation and recovery expenses. Specifically, GAO found that (1) errors in valuing receivership assets caused both overstatements and understatements in determining the allowance for loss related to receivables; (2) a calculation error in valuing equity <b>partnership</b> <b>assets</b> caused an overstatement in the allowance for loss related to other assets; and (3) incorrect operating expense amounts were allocated and recovered, which resulted in the incorrect distribution of operating expense charges among FDIC's funds.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{increase}} the knowledge base on the processes through which health promotion partnerships function by testing a newly developed model, The Bergen Model of Collaborative Functioning. The project applied a case study design utilising data from in-depth interviews with nine informants from a Norwegian partnership of NGOs engaged in alcohol policy. The results show that the partners collaborate well and have achieved results in the starting-up phase of the partnership. In collaboration, the partners have created policy platforms, defining common ground, constituting effective tools for effective actions on alcohol policy issues. Input interaction, leadership, good structures and defined roles secure partner independence and integrity, as well as partner values, creating positive cycles of interaction. Sufficient financial resources were found to reduce conflicts, thus affecting partner motivation to invest and find compromises, in addition to finance an effective secretariat. However, resource asymmetry between the partnership and the members, reinforced by ineffective communication encourage the partners to leave partnership work to the professional staff. The Bergen Model of Collaborative Functioning proved a serviceable framework and a guide to analyse this partnership. A partnership with different cultural, ideological, and religious values can avoid conflicts and enhance functioning if partner values are included into the <b>partnership’s</b> <b>assets,</b> and transformed into a partnership culture of respect. An effective staff of professionals can enhance partner equity and participation; however, it may also lead to passive partners, compromising the legitimacy of the partnership...|$|R
