One swallow does not make a summer, nor a handful of aeroplanes, a [...] "Tank" [...] or so, a few acres of shell craters, and a village here and there, pounded out of recognition, do more than foreshadow the spectacle of modernised war on land. War by these developments has become the monopoly of the five great industrial powers; it is their alternative to end or evolve it, and if they continue to disagree, then it must needs become a spectacle of majestic horror such as no man can yet conceive. It has been wise of Mr. Pennell therefore, who has recently been drawing his impressions of the war upon stone, to make his pictures not upon the battlefield, but among the huge industrial apparatus that is thrusting behind and thrusting up through the war of the gentlemen in spurs. He gives us the splendours and immensities of forge and gun <b>pit,</b> <b>furnace</b> and mine shaft. He shows you how great they are and how terrible. Among them go the little figures of men, robbed of all dominance, robbed of all individual quality. He leaves it for you to draw the obvious conclusion that presently, if we cannot contrive {{to put an end to}} war, blacknessess like these, enormities and flares and towering threats, will follow in the track of the Tanks and come trampling over the bickering confusion of mankind.|$|E

40|$|Intensive {{quenching}} (IQ) {{process is}} an alternative way of hardening (quenching) steel parts {{through the use of}} highly agitated water and then still air. It was developed by IQ Technologies, Inc. (IQT) of Akron, Ohio. While conventional quenching is usually performed in environmentally unfriendly oil or water/polymer solutions, the IQ process uses highly agitated environmentally friendly water or low concentration water/mineral salt solutions. The IQ method is characterized by extremely high cooling rates of steel parts. In contrast to conventional quenching, where parts cool down to the quenchant temperature and usually have tensile or neutral residual surface stresses at the end of quenching. The IQ process is interrupted when the part core is still hot and when there are maximum compressive stresses deep into the parts, thereby providing hard, ductile, better wear resistant parts. The project goal was to advance the patented IQ process from feasibility to commercialization in the heat-treating and forging industries to reduce significantly energy consumption and environmental impact, to increase productivity and to enhance economic competitiveness of these industries as well as Steel, Metal Casting and Mining industries. To introduce successfully the IQ technology in the U. S. metal working industry, the project team has completed the following work over the course of this project: A total of 33 manufacturers of steel products provided steel parts for IQ trails. IQT conducted IQ demonstrations for 34 different steel parts. Our customers tested intensively quenched parts in actual field conditions to evaluate the product service life and performance improvement. The data obtained from the field showed the following: Service life (number of holes punched) of cold-work punches (provided by EHT customer and made of S 5 shock-resisting steel) was improved by two to eight times. Aluminum extrusion dies provided by GAM and made of hot work H- 13 steel outperformed the standard dies by at least 50 %. Dies provided by an AST customer, made of plain carbon 1045 steel and used for pellet manufacturing outperformed the standard dies by more than 100 %. Concrete crusher liner wear plates provided by an EHT customer and made of 1045 steel, had the same surface hardness as the plates made of more expensive, pre-hardened high alloy HARDOX- 500 material supplied by a Swedish company and used currently by the EHT customer. The 1045 material intensively quenched wear plates are currently in the field. Concrete block molding machine wear plates provided by an IQT customer and made of 8620 steel were processed at the AST production IQ system using a 40 % reduced carburization cycle. An effective case depth in the intensively quenched wear plates was the same as in the standard, oil quenched parts. Base keys provided by an EHT customer and made of 8620 steel were processed using a 40 % reduced carburization cycle. The intensively quenched parts showed the same performance as standard parts. IQT introduced the IQ process in heat treat practices of three commercial heat-treating shops: Akron Steel Treating Co., Summit Heat Treating Co. and Euclid Heat Treating Co. CWRU conducted a material characterization study for a variety of steels to develop a database to support changing/modification of recognized standards for quenching steel parts. IQT conducted a series of IQ workshops, published seven technical papers and participated in ASM Heat Treating Society conference and exposition and in Furnace North America Show. IQT designed and built a fully automated new IQ system installed at the Center for Intensive Quenching. This system includes the following major components: a stand-alone 1, 900 -gallon IQ water system, a 24 '' x 24 '' atmosphere <b>pit</b> <b>furnace,</b> and an automated load transfer mechanism. IQT established a ''Center for Intensive Quenching'' at the AST facilities. The 4, 000 square feet Center includes the following equipment: High-velocity single part quenching IQ unit developed and built previously under EMTEC CT- 65 project. The unit is equipped with a neutral salt bath furnace and a high-temperature, electric-fired, atmosphere, box furnace. New 1, 900 gallon IQ system with a 24 '' x 24 '' atmosphere <b>pit</b> <b>furnace</b> and a load transfer mechanism.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} iron {{extraction}} sites from the Iron Age and the Medieval period in Rogaland county, Norway. In Southwestern Norway prehistoric and medieval traces of iron production from bog ore have been rather neglected until some 10 years ago. From Rogaland county this paper records 45 iron extraction sites from the Iron Age and the Medieval period and 33 localities with charcoal pits which probably connect with iron {{production in the}} Late Iron Age and the Middle Ages. Five of the iron extraction sites are dated to the Early Iron Age. Iron extraction took place in shaft furnaces with underlying slag <b>pits</b> (slag <b>pit</b> <b>furnaces).</b> Fourteen of the extraction sites cannot be dated any closer than prehistoric-medieval times, while 26 can be dated to the Late Iron Age - the Middle Ages. On the latter iron production took place in shaft furnaces with slag tapping (slag tapping furnaces). There {{seems to be an}} increase in the amount of iron production in Rogaland from the Early Iron Age to the Middle Ages. But as very few extraction sites have been excavated, it is at the moment impossible to decide how big this increase was. It is clear though that both in the Early and the Late Iron Age and in the Medieval period there existed side by side both a small scale iron production for the farmstead and a more big scale production. Both forms of production took part both in the areas around the farmsteads as well as in more remote parts of the county...|$|R
40|$|Operating {{conditions}} of the furnaces has the major effect {{on the quality of}} steel during steel production process. Furnaces also are the biggest energy consumer in the whole production process  which make them a center of concern, {{in order to get to}} the most optimized condition through both energy and quality aspects. Soaking <b>pit</b> <b>furnaces</b> are for heating steel ingots before rolling, in order to provide convenient conditions for ingots for further procedures. These batch furnaces are characterized by heat and temperature conditions that vary in time. The structure permits rapid heating of the metal inside the furnace, since heat is supplied over the entire surface of the ingot. One serious problem that these furnaces might contain is the existence of non-uniform temperature gradient inside the chamber that causes different temperature distribution on the ingots surface which leads to a bad surface quality of them, considering further rolling process. As the first step through obtaining the best temperature gradient inside the chamber, is to ensure the exact temperature condition in the current running procedure. In here as the first step through the problem solving of these furnaces, temperature profile, radiation profile and other effective parameters are investigated with the aid of CFD software. The simulation is done by ICEM and FLUENT programs for geometry and mesh designing, and modeling in respect. Modeling is based on four main steps:         I.             Modeling of the furnace chamber geometry and applying appropriate mesh style with ICEM       II.             Modeling the chamber with fluent, and taking the results (case 0)     III.             Modeling of six cases with different excess air, in order to investigate the best λ magnitude     IV.             Modeling of six cases with different burner capacities in order to investigate its affection on combustion parameter...|$|R

40|$|Jaggery (unrefined sugar) is {{produced}} by evaporating water from sugarcane juice in steel pans situated over <b>pit</b> <b>furnaces.</b> While it delivers a health friendly sweetening agent with medicinal value (Singh et al., 2008; Sahu and Paul, 1998), its performance, {{both in terms of}} technical efficacy and financial sustenance, is being questioned. In India, jaggery {{is produced}} in batch operations, of about 1 ton per day capacity. Bagasse is used as fuel for the process. Improving the efficiency of bagasse utilization is of interest because surplus bagasse could be used elsewhere as a fuel. If all energy in the bagasse were used to heat and evaporate water from the juice, calculations show the rate of bagasse consumption would be 0. 65 kg bagasse per kg jaggery. Heat losses in flue gas at 1000 K with no excess oxygen are calculated to decrease the efficiency to 72 % (0. 90 kg bagasse per kg jaggery). In this study, two single-pan jaggery units were tested wherein, efficiencies varied from 53 - 76 % and 50 - 57 %. The higher efficiencies in each unit were obtained by blocking some of the air inlet holes to decrease the excess air flow. The second unit has a taller chimney than the first, which may contribute to greater air flow due to increased draft. Excess air contributes to lower combustion temperatures, causing a decreased rate of heat transfer to the juice. Minimizing excess air flow into the furnace is a possible strategy for increasing the efficiency of bagasse utilization and might be implemented quite easily by placing dampers at air inlets. This study also included tests of one four-pan jaggery unit Measured efficiencies were about 50 %. Radiative heat transfer to three of the four pans is calculated to be hindered substantially by a low view factor. (C) 2013 International Energy Initiative.

50|$|A small pile of charred reeds {{was found}} {{adjacent}} to furnace 3 in KM2, and since furnace bowls {{tend to be}} cleared out after smelting, this serves as the most direct evidence {{for the use of}} swamp grass in the iron production process. Ethnographic study of the Haya people in Northwestern Tanzania shows that swamp grass is burned in the furnace bowl until the bowl is filled with the charred swamp reeds. When the iron ore melts above the tuyères, it forms a molten slag with carbon inclusions. The slag then interacts with the fibrous, carbonaceous bed provided by the burned swamp grass, which in turn provides an extremely high carbon-slag contact area for the subsequent carburization of the bloom. The charred reeds also allow the draining of slag from the blast zone, as the slag runs down the inside of the grass stalks and through the spaces between the reeds {{to the bottom of the}} <b>furnace</b> <b>pit.</b>|$|R
50|$|Herodotus {{noted that}} cats that died {{anywhere}} in Egypt were often taken to Bubastis to be mummified and {{buried in the}} great cemetery, but this {{may or may not}} have been the case. At the burial site in Bubastis the Swiss Egyptologist Édouard Naville found more than 20 m3 (720 cubic feet) of cat remains but also a great deal of evidence of cremation. Naville found stacks of cat bones in many pits, the walls of which were made up of bricks and clay. Near each <b>pit</b> lay a <b>furnace,</b> its bricks blackened from fire. This discovery causes some problems. The mummification and preservation of the body was intended to make it possible for the deceased's ka to locate its host and subsequently be reborn into the afterlife. As the body would have to be intact for this process to occur, cremation would seem an undesirable way of dealing with the body of a sacred creature with a ka. Nevertheless, many cats were afforded the full embalming ceremony and buried in other great cemeteries along the Nile.|$|R
50|$|The harbour at Borrowstounness (Bo'ness) {{was also}} not far from Causewayend, and a {{connection}} to it was desirable, enabling export and coastwise mineral trade. In addition there were ironstone <b>pits</b> and blast <b>furnaces</b> at Kinneil. The nominally independent Slamannan and Borrowstounness Railway (S&BR) had been promoted by the Slamannan company to connect to Bo'ness Harbour, with {{a link to the}} E&GR west of Bo'ness Junction (later Manuel) so aligned as to allow through running from the Polmont direction to Bo'ness. The unbuilt line was absorbed into the Monkland Railways at the time of formation of that company, but the subscribed capital of £105,000 was to be kept separate. The Act of 26 June 1846 specified that the Union Canal was to be crossed by a drawbridge or swing bridge, and that screens were to be provided to avoid frightening horses drawing barges on the canal. In fact the E&GR made considerable difficulties over the construction of the new bridge to pass the S&BR line under their own main line, and construction was delayed until 1848. With a resumption of friendly relations, it now appeared that some construction could be avoided if Slamannan to Bo'ness trains used the Slamannan Junction line to Bo'ness Junction on the E&GR and then the proposed Bo'ness Junction connection towards Bo'ness, so that trains would join and then immediately leave the E&GR main line.|$|R
25|$|This {{was in part}} {{facilitated}} by improved transportation in the area. The Crane and Thomas Iron Companies wanted a railroad to bring local ore to their furnaces, but faced strong local opposition when attempting to gain a charter. As a compromise, the Catasauqua and Fogelsville Plank Road corporation was chartered on July 2, 1853, to build a plank road from the ore <b>pits</b> to the <b>furnaces.</b> A short section of plank road was constructed, but the exceptional weight of the ore wagons quickly destroyed it. Renewed efforts to palliate the local farmers were successful, and the plank road was renamed and rechartered on April 20, 1854 as the Catasauqua and Fogelsville Railroad. The C began hauling ore from the mines near Fogelsville in 1857. In 1864, it was further extended to a connection with the East Pennsylvania Railroad at Alburtis and in 1865, to the magnetite mines at Rittenhouse Gap. Improvements to the physical plant also occurred, building No. 6 stack in 1868. The company survived the Panic of 1873 and the subsequent poor iron market, and No. 5 stack was rebuilt in 1877, introducing new firebrick heat exchangers (stoves) to heat the blast, rather than the iron pipes heretofore used. No. 3 stack collapsed in 1879 while out of blast, and Nos. 1 and 2 were subsequently demolished. A new No. 1 and 3 were built, and the site of No. 2 used for stoves for the new furnaces, which were built in 1880 and put in service in 1881. Joshua Hunt resigned the superintendency on January 1, 1882, {{six months before the}} death of his father-in-law, David Thomas.|$|R

Na dionici Osijek – Đakovo istražen je lokalitet AN 18, na zemljištu Bentež kod Beketinaca. Tijekom 2007. i 2008. g. otkriveni su ostaci tri naselja: prapovijesnog naselja lasinjske kulture (oko 4 000 g. prije Krista), ranosrednjovjekovnog naselja (od 9. do 11. st.) i kasnosrednjovjekovnog naselja (od 14. do početka 16. st.). The Institute of Archaeolog y in Zagreb {{conducted}} rescue excavations {{along the}} route of the international Budapest–Ploče motorway, which passes through Croatia under the name of Slavonica from Beli Manastir via Osijek to Svilaj. On the Osijek–Đakovo section, the AN 18 site was excavated on a plot of land called Bentež near Beketinci. In 2007 and 2008, the remains of three settlements were discovered: a Prehistoric Lasinja culture settlement (ca 4, 000 BC), an Early Medieval settlement (9 th to 11 th century) and Late Medieval settlement (14 th to early 16 th century). The Bentež plot is situated on the lowest part of the alluvial plain south of Osijek, intersected by the courses of the Karašica, Vučica and Vuka rivers. The excavated plot of the Bentež site lies approximately 3 km north of the present course of the Vuka river and it is the closest to the modern settlement of Beketinci. The oldest part of the site belongs to the Eneolithic Lasinja culture from approximately 6, 000 years before present, i. e. {{to the end of the}} 5 th and the beginning of the 4 th millennium BC or the mid-Eneolithic (Dimitrijević 1979, 137 - 181). Part of a large Copper Age settlement was uncovered which in its western, working part, consisted of numerous clay pits and two larger kilns for baking pottery and other clay artefacts. In the eastern, residential part of the settlement, three very large pit dwellings (20 x 30 m) with wells on their margins and the foundations of fi ve aboveground houses were excavated. The largest above-ground house was 30 m long and 12 m wide, with three rooms and a smaller house (8 x 5 m, with two rooms) on its southern side (Raczky 2006, 379 - 398; Virag and Figler 2007, 345 - 364). A considerable quantity of pottery and spoons was found. According to the shape these are biconical bowls, at times supplemented with a tongue-shaped decorated handle at the biconical belly line, then there are round bowls and terrinae, bowls on a hollow foot with a thickening at the upper section and jugs with sometimes decorated handle reaching up to the brim. Decorations are mostly incised, depressed and stamped. They are composed of interlaced groups of various combinations of diagonal and straight lines and ladder-shaped motifs. Filled triangles also appear as well as curved and pointed stripes, while horizontal and diagonal sequences of dots or incisions sometimes function as trimming of the vessels or motifs (Marković 1983, 251 - 262, P. 1 - 3). In addition to pottery, some lithic objects were uncovered as well: fragments of stone tools, axes with holes for fi tting shafts. The Medieval part of the settlement, of which four fi fths of the entire surface were excavated on the given motorway route, existed during two separate periods. In the northern marginal part of the excavated section of the Prehistoric settlement two pits with early medieval fi nds were discovered and the remaining part of that settlement probably extended below today’s country road leading across the fi elds further north. Among the fi nds from this Early Medieval settlement, there are vessels with simple brims, decorated with combed wavy lines and fragments of a deep biconical vessel – a kettle, 7 dating the settlement from the 9 th to 11 th century. The second part of the medieval settlement is much larger and can be dated to approximately the 14 rh and 15 th century and the very beginning of the 16 th century, when it ceased to exist – most likely due to Ottoman invasions and wars. The settlement covered a surface of approximately 20. 000 m 2 out of which 17. 000 m 2 were explored. In the settlement, roughly 35 pit dwellings were excavated with an above-ground wooden structure and about 15 wooden houses with a rectangular fl oor-plan which contained small cellar pits. In some dwellings hearths were discovered and outside of them the remains of 56 bread ovens, suggesting that there were approximately 50 families living here at that time. Therefore, it is assumed that the settlement had between 700 and 900 inhabitants. Discovery of two forges in the south-western and north-eastern parts of the settlement also confirms the theory of existence of a large settlement for that time. Substantial quantities of dross were discovered in the <b>pits</b> containing large <b>furnaces</b> and in one room of the forge a bovine skeleton (possibly a ritual burial) was found. Besides residential facilities, work pits were uncovered (some of them with slots for wooden beams at opposite sides) in which most likely various crafts proceeded. Furthermore, three wells and the remains of large wooden fences were found. The house inventory consisted of numerous vessels: middle sized and small pots, bowls, lids and several big pots – pithoi (for food reserves) of various sizes in every household. Fine Gothic pottery (also referred to as Hungarian in the literature) – bottles, pots, jugs, cups and glasses – formed a constituent part of the inventory of every household. Among them are pots and jugs with rectangular motifs (nets, diagonal lines), motifs of the sun with sun-beams combined with dots, all painted red on a light ochre background. Besides pottery, a large part of the inventory of the medieval settlement facilities consists of metal artefacts (approximately 320) predominantly iron, of various functions: parts of weapons, military equipment, horse equipment, agricultural tools, leather tools, as well as household artefacts. Among the women’s jewellery, the remains of single-bead bronze earrings, bronze pendants and several fine bronze decorative needles were excavated. Part of the household inventory also included numerous clay balls (their average diameter being approximately 5 cm) that might have served sling ammunition. A big surprise was the discovery of a bull, the papal lead seal used for various charters, found in a collapsed furnace near the only house in the settlement that had wooden foundations, situated in the northern part of the settlement. The preserved half of the lead stamp bears the figure of St. Paul on the averse and above his head there is an inscription SPAS……. – an abbreviation for “St. Peter the Apostle St. (Paul the Apostle) ”. On the reverse there are three rows of letters, rather illegible, but it was possible to identify the letters in the first row – GRE. According to the iconographic presentation of St. Paul’s head and according to the parts of letters and numbers, the inscription Gre(go) rius XI (Ricci 1985, 156), who administered the Catholic Church between 1370 and 1378 (I. Papi 2002, 102), may here be identified. The Holy See with papal seals issued various charters – bulls (ceremonial letters) – appointing bishops and canons, permits to noblemen to build churches and monasteries, privileges to single churches or church altars. The question remains open as to whom a document from the Holy See may have referred to. 8 Historical sources, according to which Pope Gregory XI in 1374 maintained correspondence with Peter, the Bishop of Đakovo, and other canons of the cathedral chapter, may be on the right track (Gulin 2001, 165; Gašić 2000, 84). A year after, Pope Gregory XI confirmed Duke Koloman’s Deed of Gift from 1239 by which he established the Bosnian Church with the support of the Pope Gregory IX and established a source of finances for the Bosnian cathedral chapter (Gašić 2000, 85). The size of the excavated Late Medieval settlement, the existence of two forges, the large quantity of luxury pottery in the houses as well as the find of the papal seal, suggest that the standard of living in the settlement was obviously higher than in neighbouring settlements and that it was probably a central settlement of the Gorjanski estate. In the Late Middle Ages the settlement played an important role among the estates of the powerful noble Gorjanski family, whose centre was in nearby Gorjani. This family attained the peak of their power in the Croato-Hungarian Monarchy precisely in the 14 th and 15 th century. Historical sources indicate that the Bosnian estates (referring to the cathedral chapter estates in Đakovo and its surroundings) were greatly damaged during the Civil War of 1398 - 1421 and completely disappeared after 1463 (Gašić 2000, 85). The settlement was burned down and destroyed in a fire perhaps precisely at the time of feudal conflicts or during one of the Ottoman invasions...|$|R
