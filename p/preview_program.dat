25|$|Bluehole {{planned to}} port {{the game to}} consoles, which will be {{released}} sometime following {{the completion of the}} Windows release, with the company already having a team starting on the Xbox One port. Greene was part of Microsoft's press conference during Electronic Entertainment Expo 2017 to announce that Battlegrounds would be coming to Xbox One as a timed console exclusive sometime by the end of 2017. Kim says they anticipate using the Xbox Game Preview early access approach to roll out and test the game on the Xbox One console. Initially, Greene said that Microsoft was not directly involved in the porting but only providing assistance to make sure the port is good, and that most of the porting responsibilities are being done by Anticto, a Spanish developer. However, at Gamescom that year, Bluehole affirmed that Microsoft Studios would be publishing the Xbox One version of the title, helping to make a planned 2017 release for this version. Greene said that Microsoft's support has helped in several ways, not only for the Xbox One version but improving the performance and security of the Windows version. Further, by being part of the group of studios under the Microsoft banner, {{they have been able to}} talk and incorporate technology from other developers, such as improved water rendering techniques they obtained from Rare that they had developed for Sea of Thieves. The Xbox One release will initially start as an early access title in the Xbox Game <b>Preview</b> <b>program</b> on December 12, 2017, and when finalized, will include a physical release alongside digital availability, and will be released on December 12, 2017.|$|E

2500|$|According to the report, GM {{viewed the}} <b>PrEView</b> <b>program</b> as a failure, {{evidence}} that the electric car was not yet viable, and that the CARB regulations should be withdrawn. Dennis Minano, GM's Vice President for Energy and Environment, questioned whether consumers desired electric vehicles. Robert James Eaton, chairman of Chrysler, also questioned whether the market was ready for electric cars, and said, [...] "... if the law is there, we'll meet it... at this point of time, nobody can forecast {{that we can make}} [...]" [...] The negative positions taken by the automakers was criticized by Thomas C. Jorling, the Commissioner of Environmental Conservation for New York State, which had adopted the California emission program. According to Jorling, consumers had demonstrated tremendous interest in electric cars, but automakers did not want to render obsolete their multibillion-dollar investments in internal combustion engine technology.|$|E

The first-generation, or [...] "Gen I" [...] car, which would be powered by lead-acid batteries and had a stated range of 70 to 100 miles; 660 cars, painted dark green, red, and silver were produced. The cars were made available via a leasing program, with the option to purchase the cars specifically disallowed by a contractual clause (the suggested retail price was quoted as $34,000). In similar fashion to the <b>PrEView</b> <b>program,</b> lessees were pre-screened by GM, with only residents of Southern California and Arizona eligible for participation. Leasing rates for the EV1 ranged from $399 to $549 a month. The car's launch was a media event, accompanied by an $8 million promotional campaign, which included prime-time TV advertising, billboards, a web site, and an appearance at the premiere of the Sylvester Stallone film Daylight. The first lessees included celebrities, executives and politicians. A total of 40 EV1 leases were signed at the release event, with GM estimating that it would lease 100 cars {{by the end of the}} year. Deliveries began on December 5, 1996.|$|E

40|$|I have {{developed}} an X Protocol compression scheme called Higher Bandwidth X (HBX). This paper describes one aspect of HBX: POSTSCRIPT previewing. Using statistical models and arithmetic coding, HBX compresses the X protocol stream resulting from using ghostscript to preview documents by about 20 : 1, roughly 8 times the compression achieved by Xremote on the same stream. This is about 12 bits per source character after compression, implying a transmission time of about 3 seconds per page for normally formatted documents (3600 characters per page) using a standard 14400 bps modem. Introduction Higher Bandwidth X (HBX) is a compressed X protocol intended to provide improved interactive performance across low bandwidth interconnects such as serial lines. This paper describes the techniques used to achieve 20 : 1 lossless compression of the X protocol stream generated by the ghostscript POSTSCRIPT <b>previewing</b> <b>program,</b> when ghostscript is used to preview documents.

50|$|The {{most basic}} {{part of a}} vision mixer is a bus, which is a signal path {{consisting}} of multiple video inputs that feeds a single output. On the panel, a bus is represented by a row of buttons; pressing one of those buttons selects the video signal in that bus. Older video mixers had two equivalent buses (called the A and B bus; such a mixer is known as an A/B mixer), and one of these buses could be selected as the main out (or program) bus. Most modern mixers, however, have one bus that is always the program bus, the second main bus being the preview (sometimes called preset) bus. These mixers are called flip-flop mixers, since the selected source of the <b>preview</b> and <b>program</b> buses can be exchanged. Some switchers allow the operator to switch between these two modes. Both the <b>preview</b> and <b>program</b> bus usually have their own video monitors displaying the video selected in their respective buses.|$|R
