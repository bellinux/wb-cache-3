In terms of planting structure, what farmers from <b>protection</b> <b>areas</b> plant most is food crop, whereas farmers from non-protection areas mostly plant commercial crop. This difference of planting structure leads to imbalance of interests of farmers. In terms of the income level, the proportion of income of farmers in <b>protection</b> <b>areas</b> to the income of farmers in non-protection areas is 1 : 4. 3.
