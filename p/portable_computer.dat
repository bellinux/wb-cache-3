5|$|Apple {{unveiled}} the PowerBook100 on October 21, 1991, at the Comdex computer expo in Las Vegas, {{with two other}} models, the PowerBook 140 and PowerBook 170. The advertisement and the product were both successful. Apple projected US sales of more than 200,000 PowerBooks in the first year, with peak demand {{in the first three}} months of release. By January 1992, Apple had sold more than 100,000 PowerBooks, by which time they were in short supply. Apple soon solved the supply problems, and the proceeds from PowerBook sales reached $1billion in the first year after launch. Apple surpassed Toshiba and Compaq as the market leader in worldwide share of <b>portable</b> <b>computer</b> shipments. The PowerBook100, 140, and 170 contributed greatly to Apple's financial success in 1992. At the end of the financial year, Apple announced its highest figures yet, $7.1billion in revenues and an increase in global market share from 8% to 8.5%, the highest it had been in four years.|$|E
5|$|Aleph {{was created}} to embody the Shin Megami Tensei II world, which is {{reflected}} in his character design: he has a <b>portable</b> <b>computer</b> and a visor that he controls demons with, and carries swords, guns and armor for use in battle. His computer was designed to look compact, and the visor {{was designed to be}} wireless, to show that the game takes place in the future. Kaneko decided to not give Aleph a personality, partially because he is controlled by the player, and partially because he is portrayed as an artificial being, created by the Center's scientists. Beth and Daleth were designed to look similar to the first Shin Megami Tensei Heroine and Hero, using the colors blue and green, respectively. Lucifer was visually portrayed as an elegant gentleman, as Kaneko saw him as someone who tempts and tries the player, rather than being evil. He designed Lucifer in accordance with portrayals of him as a beautiful twelve-winged angel, but gave him six wings instead, for a total of twelve across his appearances in Shin Megami Tensei and Shin Megami Tensei II.|$|E
5|$|Flower, Sun, and Rain {{forms the}} final {{part of an}} {{unofficial}} trilogy with Moonlight Syndrome, a spin-off of the Twilight Syndrome series Suda's final work for Human Entertainment, and The Silver Case. According to Suda, while they use the same setting and have some recurring characters, there is otherwise no connection. Despite acting as a sequel to The Silver Case, and featuring a version of that game's protagonist Sumio Kodai, the story was almost completely unrelated {{to the events of}} The Silver Case. This approach was inspired by the Star System utilized by manga artist Osamu Tezuka. The opening scene, where Mondo drives his car towards the island, was put into the game to both introduce Mondo's character to newcomers, and to throw players of The Silver Case off guard and confirm Mondo's two different identities in the two games. It also helped establish the setting and get the player used to Mondo's point of view. His <b>portable</b> <b>computer</b> Catherine, stored in a suitcase, was a reference to the events of The Silver Case due to earlier events being concentrated within it. Despite this, its silver color was coincidental rather than a deliberate reference to the previous game's title.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: 2 ̆ 2 <b>Portable</b> <b>computers</b> {{including}} laptops, notebooks, sub- notebooks {{and portable}} digital assistants are {{a rapidly growing}} segment of the computer market. Manufacturers of <b>portable</b> <b>computers</b> {{have an opportunity to}} win public praise and to avoid censure and liability by embracing green design and sensible product disposal systems. This paper analyzes the environmental issues associated with disposal, re-use and recycling of these machines, focusing on potential design changes to alleviate environmental burdens. <b>Portable</b> <b>computers</b> can replace larger machines, resulting in lower energy use and lower overall material demand. Since the number of <b>portable</b> <b>computers</b> purchased may be as many as 100 million over the next decade, environmental concerns become increasingly important. <b>Portable</b> <b>computers</b> use batteries with toxic components, so there are disposal or recycling problems. Another significant issue in assessment of disposal and recycling processes is the expected life time of <b>portable</b> <b>computers.</b> Machine design with capability for easy upgrade can be expected to have a longer useful life. The paper uses experience gained in several generations of wearable computer designs at Carnegie Mellon University for illustration. 2 ̆...|$|R

Initially to be ZX Spectrum-compatible with a faster Z80 CPU, a built-in ZX Microdrive and a new 512×192-pixel monochrome video mode. Due to the limited size of flat CRT that could be manufactured, a series of folding lenses and mirrors were necessary to magnify the screen image to a usable size. The project was cancelled after the Amstrad take-over, but the Pandora concept eventually transformed into the Cambridge Computer Z88.|$|E
25|$|Paperless geocaching means hunting a geocache {{without a}} {{physical}} printout of the cache description. Traditionally, {{this means that}} the seeker has an electronic means of viewing the cache information in the field, such as pre-downloading the information to a PDA or other electronic device. Various applications are able to directly upload and read GPX files without further conversion. Newer GPS devices released by Garmin, DeLorme and Magellan have the ability to read GPX files directly, thus eliminating the need for a PDA. Other methods include viewing real-time information on a <b>portable</b> <b>computer</b> with internet access or with a web-enabled smart phone. The latest advancement of this practice involves installing dedicated applications on a smart phone with a built-in GPS receiver. Seekers can search for and download caches in their immediate vicinity directly to the application and use the on-board GPS receiver to find the cache.|$|E

2500|$|It was {{not long}} until Apple {{released}} their first <b>portable</b> <b>computer,</b> the Macintosh Portable in 1989.

They were the first portable computers with the keyboard behind a palm rest and a built-in pointing device (a trackball) in front of the keyboard. The 1993 PowerBook 165c was Apple's first <b>portable</b> <b>computer</b> to feature a color screen, displaying 256 colors with -pixel resolution. The second generation of PowerBooks, the 68040-equipped 500 series, introduced trackpads, integrated stereo speakers, and built-in Ethernet to the laptop form factor in 1994.|$|E

2500|$|The {{public water}} and sewer utility of Quito, EMAAP-Q, was turned around between 2000 and 2008, {{according}} to its general manager, Juan Neira. In this period water coverage in the city increased from 72% to 98% and sanitation coverage from 68% to 93%. A multistakeholder Fund for Water (FONAG) introduced innovative financing mechanisms to help protect watershed supply regions, promote conservation, and encourage public participation in valuing clean water. The company replaced its cumbersome manual billing system with an electronic billing system in 2008 under which an inspector, equipped with a <b>portable</b> <b>computer,</b> visit homes to read water consumption meters and immediately types and delivers the bill to users. Non-revenue water {{is said to have}} been reduced from 47.8% in 2000 to 30% in 2008 through the installation of household meters and the reduction of clandestine water connections. However, the performance indicators on the EMAAP-Q website show that non-revenue water was 38% in 2002 and 37% in 2006, with not data for subsequent years. Investments were financed by the Inter-American Development Bank under a US$170m project that closed in 2002, the Development Bank of Latin America under a US$25m project that was under execution in 2009 [...] and company funds. According to its website, the firm has obtained international awards for administrative excellence and the quality of services, such as the gold medal of excellence by the Corporación Ecuatoriana de Calidad Total in 2007 and the Arch of Europe International Quality Award for Technology in 2008, without specifying the details of the awards. In April 2009 there was, however, no independent confirmation of these awards on the Internet. The company showed an operating loss before interest of US$5.5m in January–February 2009, and needed a government transfer of US$6.3m in the same period to balance its books.|$|E
