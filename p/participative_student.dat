40|$|Most {{students}} see Mathematics {{as one of}} the most challenging and stressful subjects, which if given an option, would rather opt out than undertake it. With low motivation and interest levels, the thought of undertaking a course in Mathematics can be worrying for some. Consequently, teachers are faced with disinterested students, who are passive in class, which makes teaching of the subject even more challenging. At times, with non <b>participative</b> <b>students,</b> Mathematics classrooms appear 'solemn'. Through the years, teachers have been experimenting or 'trying out' various approaches/techniques, in their attempt to develop students' interest and motivation. With the advent of information technology tools, teachers have now attempted to adopt more innovative approaches and incorporate ICT tools into Mathematics classrooms as well. One such tool is the graphing calculator (GC), which is adopted in this study. The incorporation of GCs into Malaysian Mathematics classrooms is at its infant stages. The study examined the students' reactions toward the incorporation of GCs into Probability lessons as well as the subject itself. Findings favor the adoption of GC in learning Probability, particularly in terms of calculator usage, quality of output, understanding of Probability concepts, confidence in solving problems, enhanced communication abilities and positive attitudes towards GC. Recommendations made aimed at assisting educators, policy-makers and researchers in enhancing the quality of the teaching and learning of Probability...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background While {{evaluation}} is, in theory, {{a component}} of training programmes in health planning, training needs in this area remain significant. Improving health systems necessarily calls for having more professionals who are skilled in evaluation. Thus, the Université de Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) and the Université de Montréal (Canada) have partnered to establish, in Burkina Faso, a master's-degree programme in population and health with a course in programme evaluation. This article describes the four-week (150 -hour) course taken by two cohorts (2005 – 2006 / 2006 – 2007) of health professionals from 11 francophone African countries. We discuss how the course came to be, its content, its teaching processes and the master's programme results for students. Methods The conceptual framework was adapted from Kirkpatrick's (1996) four-level evaluation model: reaction, learning, behaviour, results. Reaction was evaluated based on a standardized questionnaire for all the master's courses and lessons. Learning and behaviour competences were assessed {{by means of a}} questionnaire (pretest/post-test, one year after) adapted from the work of Stevahn L, King JA, Ghere G, Minnema J: Establishing Essential Competencies for Program Evaluators. Am J Eval 2005, 26 (1) : 43 – 59. Master's programme effects were tested by comparing the difference in mean scores between times (before, after, one year after) using pretest/post-test designs. Paired sample tests were used to compare mean scores. Results The teaching is skills-based, interactive and <b>participative.</b> <b>Students</b> of the first cohort gave the evaluation course the highest score (4. 4 / 5) for overall satisfaction among the 16 courses (3. 4 – 4. 4) in the master's programme. What they most appreciated was that the forms of evaluation were well adapted to the content and format of the learning activities. By the end of the master's programme, both cohorts of students considered that they had greatly improved their mastery of the 60 competences (p Conclusion This study shows the importance of integrating summative evaluation into the learning process. Skills-based teaching is much appreciated and well-adapted. Creating a master's programme in population and health in Africa and providing training in evaluation to high-level health professionals from many countries augurs well for scaling up the practice of evaluation in African health systems. </p...|$|R

It mines a rich vein of work sustained at Cambridge over many years. Contributors to this work have included Jean Rudduck, Michael Fielding, Donald McIntyre, John MacBeath and Madeleine Arnot. The modes of participation considered include student voice or consultation, <b>students</b> as researchers, <b>participative</b> pedagogy and <b>student</b> leadership. These resonate with {{the values of the}} Leadership for Learning (LfL) endeavour (MacBeath & Dempster, 2009) in which shared leadership is a cornerstone. This article explores the relationship between the key concepts of learning, participation and democracy. It draws its analysis from a series of key projects initiated under the umbrella of LfL in Cambridge in recent years, including the ???Influence and Participation of Young People in their Learning??? project (MacBeath et al., 2008), the ???Evaluation of the Learning to Lead Initiative??? project (Frost & MacBeath, 2010) and the ???Student Leadership for School Improvement??? project (Roberts & Nash, 2010). All of these projects have enabled students at a variety of ages to exercise leadership and become full partners in the enterprise of learning.

40|$|This paper {{reflects}} {{the impact of}} service-learning in the nursing discipline at the University of the Free State (UFS) in South-Africa on students and community. Professional Nurses further their studies {{in the field of}} Nursing Education where service- learning is used as an educational tool to facilitate the implementation of global citizenship skills and mutual beneficial service-learning activities related to educational practice. As a pre-activity to developing a curriculum, nursing education (NE) students must perform a situational needs assessment in the community to ensure that the curriculum is relevant for all stakeholders. Furthermore, NE students design a lesson plan; facilitate a student-centered lesson and perform clinical demonstrations in the community as a learning environment. Sequentially, health care workers is exposed to innovative educational practices and receives an opportunity {{to go back to their}} communities and share their knowledge and skills to facilitate solutions to everyday health challenges. The research in this paper is embedded in a current research project at the UFS, funded by the National Research Foundation. The research question that is dealt with is: “How can Higher Education Institutions (HEI) and the community sector establish long-term, research-based collaborative engagements that will be mutually empowering and enabling through joint, reciprocal knowledge-based activities and capacity building. ” This empirical research investigates the empowering developmental effect of applied knowledge on students and community partners involved in the abovementioned service-learning endeavour. Data gathering took place before, during and after the course implementation. A variety of techniques were used to ensure rigour and triangulation of the data e. g. direct observation embedded in experience, reflective journals, questionnaires, focus group discussions and multimedia.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{development}} of student voice in a Pupil Referral Unit. The research offers a unique perspective since it is situated outside mainstream school settings and reflects strategies which are beyond the conventional <b>participative</b> models of <b>student</b> voice. Previous research within the organisation indicates that excluded students in urban settings lack the skills to communicate effectively, particularly with those in authority. This limits their ability to articulate their opinions and ideas both inside the organisation and in the wider community. The thesis aims to develop strategies that will support excluded students in establishing their voice by exploring {{the idea of a}} specialised curriculum which develops the skills of empowerment and self advocacy so that students become more articulate, confident and able to communicate successfully. The methodology is practitioner research within the wider context of an on-going action research project in the organisation. A series of focus groups involved staff and students in a critical analysis of current practice and identifying the key elements of a specialised curriculum. Three strands of theoretical analysis are used: (1) Theories that place excluded students in the wider social and political context, which provide an insight into the consequences of exclusion and the discourses of difference that emerge. (2) Models of education based on social justice and empowerment, linked to a critical pedagogy. (3) Work on student voice and how this can inform {{the development of}} strategies that support excluded young people in establishing a coherent and articulate voice. Research outcomes indicate the need for a specialist curriculum including key elements that would support excluded students in developing their voice. Essential to this is a critical pedagogy and a range of teaching and learning strategies that are integrated throughout the whole college curriculum.

40|$|O artigo analisa resultados e limites de um projeto de extensão universitária realizado em um serviço público de saúde com atendimento {{integral}} ao adolescente. O projeto foi desenvolvido através de metodologia participativa, envolveu acadêmicos e profissionais das áreas de saúde e humanas, respondendo à necessidade de se realizar trabalhos de prevenção com adolescentes. O projeto justifica-se pelo aumento dos índices de gravidez não planejada entre meninas; pelos índices de infecção de DST e Aids; e pelo uso de drogas. Programas de saúde e o cumprimento dos conteúdos dos Parâmetros Curriculares Nacionais do MEC poderiam atuar para minimizar a vulnerabilidade sociocultural de jovens. Oficinas de prevenção possibilitaram melhor interação entre os profissionais do serviço e os adolescentes, além de representarem um espaço de reflexão sobre assuntos relacionados à sexualidade, temas dificilmente discutidos com a família ou na escola. As oficinas apresentam-se, portanto, como instrumentos eficazes de prevenção e de promoção à saúde, podendo ser operacionalizadas, nos serviços de saúde, por equipes interdisciplinares. This study {{analyzes the}} results and limits of a university extension project carried out in a public health service unit giving assistance to adolescents. The project developed through the <b>participative</b> methodology, involved <b>students</b> and professionals from the fields {{of health and human}} sciences. It is justified by the increase in the indexes of non-planned pregnancy amongst young girls, in the indexes of infection by STD and Aids, and drug use. The low number of programs turned to adolescents and the lack of a national project of sexual orientation in the schools increase the social-cultural vulnerability of young people. The workshops on prevention made it possible for a better interaction between professionals and adolescents, besides representing a space for reflection about sexuality-related subjects, hardly ever discussed within the family or at school. The workshops are presented, therefore, as effective tools in the prevention {{as well as in the}} promotion of health, and may be carried out in the health services by interdisciplinary teams...|$|R
40|$|Leadership {{has been}} {{identified}} as one of the key factors that determine the atmosphere that exists in most organizations. Among the core functions universities are tasked to perform is the training of the people who eventually but not exclusively become leaders, administrators and managers of most organizations all over the world. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine how the concept of student leadership is being used as a model for training and developing leadership skills and abilities in the Ghanaian context, using the University of Education, Winneba, Ghana, as a study setting. As an autonomous and multi-faceted institution with varied interests and stakeholders, decision-making and implementation at the University of Education, Winneba, requires a <b>participative</b> approach where <b>student</b> leaders, who, being the mouth-piece of the general student body are given the opportunity to make inputs into administrative decisions that affect their lives on campus. Various interpretations were given to justify the application of democratic principles in leadership. This includes the fact that leadership has taken a paradigm shift from the influence of an individual to a shared responsibility devoid of intimidation and acrimony. A qualitative approach was used in the study. Interviews and observation were the main tools used in data collection. In addition, relevant documents were analyzed. In all, ten respondents comprising seven student leaders, two faculty and administrative members and a past student leader were used. To maintain a balance of approaches, various methods were used in data collection. The data collected was analyzed using an inductive approach to determine how leadership theories are applied in practice. The findings show that the application of democratic principles in tight bureaucracies is relative since power cannot be effectively shared among university administrators and student leaders. The existence of a bureaucracy in itself is a check on how stakeholders exercise their discretion. However, the existence of a stable academic atmosphere suggests that student leaders are well represented in all decision-making levels of the University of Education, Winneba. It has also been established that on-the-job training is an effective means of developing commitment and capacity for leadership. Similarly, past student leaders seem to be exhibiting good leadership and management abilities, a situation that can partly be attributed to their experiences as student leaders. It is therefore recommended that the University of Education, Winneba, should promote leadership development not only using the student leadership concept but also as an academic discipline in a bid to empower the youth of the country in general. Additionally, interest in women leadership should be given special attention to encourage women participation in decision-making at all levels in the Ghanaian society...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{internationalization}} is {{high on the}} {{agendas of}} national governments, international bodies and institutions of higher education. Huge economic and human resources are involved in internationalization efforts, without real knowledge of what exactly its impact is. The {{purpose of this study}} is to describe, analyze and reflect on different actions of campus-based internationalization and research carried out at two Norwegian colleges (Akershus and Oslo University Colleges) and at a Spanish International Projects Office OFPI (Granada University), as well as to see its impact on the development of intercultural competence among participants. Our study case uses the process and competences development approach to internationalization. It involves a multi-method design: qualitative ethnographic study with retroductive and inductive strategies based on institutional document analysis, informal interviews, participative observation, field notes, internship diary, photograph analysis and is complemented by quantitative study (questionnaire). These research instruments were applied on different levels of the campuses population in order to reach exhaustive comprehension of the subjects being studied: the key people responsible for planning policy and implementation of IHE (Norwegian campuses) and internationalization of research (Spanish campus) on the three campuses, international offices, professors, campus services, domestic and international <b>students.</b> <b>Participative</b> observation (as an international student and member of management of internationalization efforts) was carried out during the academic and internship periods in both countries. A questionnaire was also applied among participants of international research projects (IRP) managed by OFPI. Data collection and analysis were implemented from administrative practitioner (management) and pedagogic point of view. The Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats of each campus internationalization strategy were presented. Comparative perspective of IHE and research internationalization, considering national and organizational culture influence on strategy implementation in our study contexts was also discussed. Our study reveals that campus culture is shaped by a planned internationalization strategy as well as unplanned factors such as the dimension of national and organizational culture. The reflection on strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the internationalization strategy helps in the innovation process. Academic and administrative staff with a well-developed IC is an indispensable pillar of international campuses. A well-planned IaH provides an opportunity for the development of interculturally-aware citizens and professionals and furthermore decreases cultural shock among overseas guests. The ownership of an internationalization initiative shared by the whole campus staff is the most relevant strength of the internationalization strategy. The mix of international and domestic students still is a big challenge for international educators and administrators. The lack of IC among campus staff, domestic and international students, and the repetition of stereotypes interfere in these groups’ interaction. Participation in IRP helps in the development of IC but not in a scale expected. Researcher much more improved their IC through cooperation in IRP than administrators and men more than women. All these factors can influence the performance of IaH and IRP as well as intercultural and international cooperation in HE. In order to innovate university campus through internationalization strategy focus on intercultural training of the campus staff is desir...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Medical {{education}} continually demonstrates {{difficulties in}} {{keeping up with}} and preparing students for the evolving demands of patients, practice, and society. This is not {{due to a lack}} of effort: Change without reform runs rampant. Analyzing these efforts reveals a tendency to fragment and focus on planning and designing solutions, i. e. content. However, content is only one of the three ingredients identified as essential to successful change by the strategic management literature. Attention needs to be paid to the interaction between content, context, and the change process. The conventional approaches to change employed in medical education are mechanistic and based on linear process thinking unsuited to the complexity of the context. The aim of this thesis is to explore how knowledge from change management can be applied to understand and facilitate the process of improving medical curricula. Methods: Study I, a conceptual analysis of peer-reviewed articles of Linköping Health University’s successful change effort, employed a strategic management framework to understand curricular innovation. An abductive action research approach was then used to understand the challenge of change in medical education by participating in the facilitation of change. The experience gained was formulated as a question-driven, facilitator-led planning and implementation process, Adaptive Reflection (AR). AR was subsequently tested and evaluated in Study II, III, and IV. Study II, an explanatory case study, used a complexity framework to explain how AR helped participants develop three undergraduate medical school courses at Karolinska Institutet (KI). Study III, an explanatory multiple case study, used thematic analysis of 17 semi-structured interviews with participants from two AR interventions in four psychiatric residency courses in Sweden. Study IV used content analysis to explore how 13 undergraduate nursing students at KI experienced the process of creating web-based continuing professional development courses with the help of AR. Findings: Knowledge from change management was used to understand how Linköping Health University used the threat of closure as an opportunity to innovate their curriculum (I). They collaborated outside the boundaries of the medical school, created a unique strategic profile, and used it to develop interprofessional training and create exceptional utility for their graduates. When Adaptive Reflection was used to facilitate curriculum change, a complexity framework analysis showed how interaction and reflection were encouraged and power gradients mitigated (III & IV). The juxtaposition of outputs from the different AR steps made explicit contradictions in desired learning outcomes and behaviors (II). This led to self-organization and the emergence of new curricula. In terms of output generated from AR, three courses mobilized an improvement effort, participants took over the facilitator’s role, and the process spread to and triggered another course to start their own (II). A pre/post AR comparison (III) found reductions in lecture time, more learner-centered multimodal activities, which were explicitly aligned with clearly defined learning outcomes that included ethical aspects and addressed patient concerns. In terms of how participants experienced the AR process (III), they described: a) a strict structure that paradoxically felt free; b) ploughing ahead; c) collaborative and creative; d) validating and <b>participative.</b> When nursing <b>students</b> worked with AR (IV), they described their experience as a journey from chaos to confidence which led to the acquisition and development of new ways of working, new competencies, new ways of viewing the group, and increased feelings of self-efficacy. Conclusions: The AR process proved effective in changing medical curricula. The changes occurred through local dialogue as participants answer the AR questions. Instead of focusing on content, the content emerged through a reflective process that respected the complexity of the context...|$|R
