5000|$|The forward-moving {{narrative}} stream {{deals with}} the attempts of Diziet Sma and a drone named Skaffen-Amtiskaw (of Special Circumstances, a division of Contact) to re-enlist Zakalwe for another job. He must make contact with Beychae, an old colleague, in a politically unstable star system to further {{the aims of the}} Culture in the region. The payment that Zakalwe demands is the location of a woman, named Livueta. The backward-moving narrative stream describes earlier jobs that Zakalwe has performed for the Culture, ultimately returning to his <b>pre-Culture</b> childhood with his two sisters (Livueta and Darckense) and a boy his age named Elethiomel whose father has been imprisoned for treason. As the two streams of the narrative conclude, it emerges that Elethiomel and Zakalwe commanded two opposing armies in a bloody civil war. Elethiomel took Darckense hostage before finally having her killed and her bones and skin made into a chair, to be sent to Zakalwe, who attempted suicide upon receiving it. After the successful extraction of Beychae, a severely wounded Zakalwe is taken back to his homeworld to see Livueta. She rejects him and reveals that [...] "Cheradenine Zakalwe" [...] is in fact Elethiomel who had stolen the real Zakalwe's identity after he had killed himself during the civil war. Elethiomel suffers an aneurysm and Skaffen-Amtiskaw performs surgery in an attempt to save him; it is left unspecified whether Elethiomel survives.|$|E

It was then increased to two hundred lines and the myth called cattle and grain by Samuel Noah Kramer in 1959; he called it the [...] "second myth significant for the Sumerian concept of the creation of man". He added the translation of a tablet by Hermann Hilprecht and included translations of museum tablet numbers 7344, 7916, 15161 and 29.15.973.

This study investigated the influence of a range of <b>pre-culture</b> durations for human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) before inducing differentiation into osteoblast-like cells. The aim was to find the conditions that lead to maximal extracellular matrix (ECM) mineralization, in terms of both amount and best distribution. Additionally, the influence of silk fibroin scaffold pore size on mineralization was assessed. The formation of mineralized ECM by hMSCs cultured in osteogenic medium on silk fibroin scaffolds was monitored and quantified for up to 72 days in culture using non-invasive time-lapse micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). ECM mineralization increased linearly 3 weeks after the beginning of the experiment with addition of differentiation medium. Biochemical end-point assays measured the amount of DNA, calcium deposits, alkaline phosphatase activity and cell metabolic activity to corroborate the hypothesis that an initial <b>pre-culture</b> period of hMSCs on silk fibroin scaffolds can accelerate mineralized ECM formation. According to the micro-CT analysis mineralization on silk fibroin scaffolds with pores of 112 - 224 µm diameter was most efficient with an initial cell <b>pre-culture</b> period of 9 days, showing 6. 87 ± 0. 81 × higher mineralization values during the whole cultivation period than without an initial cell <b>pre-culture</b> period. © 2011 Acta Materialia Inc.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine if the maturation stage of engineered cartilage implanted in a goat model of cartilage injury influences the repair outcome. Goat engineered cartilage was generated from autologous chondrocytes cultured in hyaluronic acid scaffolds using 2 d, 2 weeks or 6 weeks of <b>pre-culture</b> and implanted above hydroxyapatite/hyaluronic acid sponges into osteochondral defects. Control defects were left untreated or treated with cell-free scaffolds. The quality of repair tissues was assessed 8 weeks or 8 months post implantation by histological staining, modified O’Driscoll scoring and biochemical analyses. Increasing <b>pre-culture</b> time resulted in progressive maturation of the grafts in vitro. After 8 weeks in vivo, the quality of the repair was not improved by any treatment. After 8 months, O’Driscoll histology scores indicated poor cartilage architecture for untreated (29. 7 ± 1. 6) and cell-free treated groups (24. 3 ± 5. 8). The histology score was improved when cellular grafts were implanted, with best scores observed for grafts pre-cultured for 2 weeks (16. 3 ± 5. 8). As compared to shorter <b>pre-culture</b> times, grafts cultured for 6 weeks (histology score: 22. 3 ± 6. 4) displayed highest type II/I collagen ratios but also inferior architecture of the surface and within the defect, as well as lower integration with native cartilage.

40|$|In this study, we {{aimed at}} {{developing}} and validating a technique for the engineering of osteochondral grafts {{based on the}} biological bonding of a chondral layer with a bony scaffold by cell-laid extracellular matrix. Osteochondral composites were generated by combining collagen-based matrices (Chondro-Gide) containing human chondrocytes with devitalized spongiosa cylinders (Tutobone) using a fibrin gel (Tisseel). We demonstrate that separate <b>pre-culture</b> of the chondral layer for 3 days prior to the generation of the composite allows for (i) more efficient cartilaginous matrix accumulation than no <b>pre-culture,</b> as assessed histologically and biochemically, and (ii) superior biological bonding to the bony scaffold than 14 days of <b>pre-culture,</b> as assessed using a peel-off mechanical test, developed to measure integration of bilayered materials. The presence of the bony scaffold induced an upregulation in the infiltrated cells of the osteoblast-related gene bone sialoprotein, indicative of {{the establishment of a}} gradient of cell phenotypes, but did not affect per se the quality of the cartilaginous matrix in the chondral layer.

40|$|Background aims. Despite the {{availability}} of modern antibiotics/antimycotics and cytokine support, neutropenic infection accounts {{for the majority of}} chemotherapy-associated deaths. While transfusion support with donor neutrophils is possible, cost and complicated logistics make such an option unrealistic on a routine basis. A manufactured neutrophil product could enable routine prophylactic administration of neutrophils, preventing the onset of neutropenia and substantially reducing the risk of infection. We examined the use of <b>pre-culture</b> strategies and various cytokine/modulator combinations to improve neutrophil expansion from umbilical cord blood (UCB) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HPC). Methods. Enriched UCB HPC were cultured using either two-phase <b>pre-culture</b> strategies or a single phase using various cytokine/modulator combinations. Outcome was assessed with respect to numerical expansion, cell morphology, granulation and respiratory burst activity. Results. <b>Pre-culture</b> in the absence of strong differentiation signals (e. g. granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; G-CSF) failed to provide any improvement to final neutrophil yields. Similarly, removal of differentiating cells during <b>pre-culture</b> failed to improve neutrophil yields to an appreciable extent. Of the cytokine/modulator combinations, the addition of granulocyte [...] macrophage (GM) -colony-stimulating factor (CSF) alone gave the greatest increase. In order to avoid production of monocytes, it was necessary to remove GM-CSF on day 5. Using this strategy, neutrophil expansion improved 2. 7 -fold. Conclusions. Although all cytokines and culture strategies employed have been reported previously to enhance HPC expansion, we found that the addition of GM-CSF alone was sufficient to improve total cell yields maximally. The need to remove GM-CSF on day 5 to avoid monocyte differentiation highlights the context and time-dependent complexity of exogenous signaling in hematopoietic cell differentiation and growth...|$|E

The effect of <b>pre-culturing</b> before shipment using electrolyzed seawater on reduction of Vibrio parahaemolyticus and viable bacteria inhabiting the sea urchin viscera was examined. When 3 % salt water suspended with V. parahaemolyticus was electrolyzed, the viable number of V. parahaemolyticus was reduced by more than 99. 99 % after treatment with 0. 23 mg/L chlorine for one minute. In the case of sea urchin reared with electrolyzed seawater containing 0. 76 mg/L chlorine for 2 days, a lot of dejecture was discharged, and the bacteria in the sea urchin viscera were reduced by more than 90 %...|$|R
