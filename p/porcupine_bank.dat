40|$|The Porcupine Basin, {{southwest}} of Ireland, {{was one of}} the earliest sites from where the deep-water corals Lophelia sp. and Madrepora sp. were recovered. These deep-water corals have since been found all along the Atlantic margins of Europe, in water depths ranging from 50 to more than 2000 m. Recent geophysical studies have demonstrated the mound-building potential of deep-water corals. Available data indicate that three major provinces of coral bank occurrences can be identified in the Porcupine Basin: (1) high-relief surface mounds which have a dimension of 1 by 5 km and a height up to 200 m (‘Hovland’ mounds), flanked to the north by (2) a swarm of buried mounds, somewhat smaller (up to 90 m), and with more irregular shapes than those recognised in area 1 (‘Magellan’ mounds), and (3) outcropping or buried, conical mounds (single or in elongated clusters, up to 150 m high) occurring on the southeastern slope of the basin (‘Belgica’ mounds). As far as can be inferred from shallow cores, the surface lithology predominantly consists of an upper layer rich in foraminiferal sand and terrigenous silty clay with intercalations of biogenic rubble. The banks host a remarkable number of colonies of living and dead Lophelia pertusa and Madrepora oculata. The living and dead assemblages are underlain by a significant layer of coral debris in a muddy matrix. Deep-water coral debris together with a living association of the same species covers the surface of the ‘Belgica’ and ‘Hovland’ mounds, which may suggest that these corals have {{played a significant role in}} the development of the mound structures. The capacity for mound formation by scleractinian corals in the aphotic zone has been known for some time. Examples are found at different locations along the shelves and the continental margins of the North Atlantic. The role of the corals in these deep-water build-ups is still a point of debate. Though the genesis and initial control of mound settings in this basin might be related to hydrocarbon seeps, it appears that the major development of the <b>Porcupine</b> coral <b>banks</b> in recent geological times has most likely been controlled by oceanic circulation and dynamics in water masses and nutrient supply...|$|R

40|$|Cold-water coral {{ecosystems}} building cold-water carbonate mounds occur {{worldwide and}} are especially developed along the European margin, from northern Norway to the Gulf of Cadiz. A remarkable mound province is documented southwest of Ireland along the <b>Porcupine</b> and Rockall <b>Banks.</b> In this area carbonate mounds are formed in water depths between 500 and 1200 m {{and are often}} densely settled by cold-water coral ecosystems offering many ecological niches for benthic foraminifera. We investigated total (unstained) benthic foraminiferal assemblages from surface sediments (0 – 1 cm, > 63 µm size fraction) of this region with the aim to trace their distribution patterns and to test {{if they can be}} used as bioindicators for facies characterization in different parts of carbonate mound systems. Our quantitative data were further statistically treated with non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) based on Bray–Curtis similarity matrix to highlight community patterns that were not readily apparent. Our results indicate that different benthic foraminiferal assemblages characterize different facies along cold-water carbonate mounds and are related to the environmental conditions and available substrates. The following facies can be described: (1) the Off-Mound Facies is dominated by uvigerinids and other infaunal species; (2) the Dropstone Facies is characterized by infaunal Globocassidulina subglobosa and attached-epifaunal Cibicidoides sp.; (3) the Dead Coral Facies is characterised by epifaunal species (e. g., Planulina ariminensis, Hanzawaia boueana) and infaunal species (Spiroplectinella wrightii, Angulogerina angulosa, Epistominella vitrea); (4) the Living Coral Facies includes both infaunal and epifaunal species, but is dominated by the epifaunal Discanomalina coronate; and (5) the Sandwave Facies contains high abundances of epifaunal species including D. coronata. Based on this distribution, we propose D. coronata, as an indicator species to identify active mounds and/or living cold-water coral ecosystems. Our results also emphasise the importance of studying the small size fractions that yield many infaunal species. A causal link exists between distribution patterns of benthic foraminifera and cold-water coral facies, thus providing an independent tool to identify and describe the different facies in this setting...|$|R

40|$|The {{seasonal}} {{response of}} two shelf ecosystems in the North Atlantic to fluctuations in climate variability is investigated. The Western Irish Shelf and the Georges Bank/Gulf of Maine are highly productive shelf systems (3 ̆e 300 gC m- 2 y- 1) located at mid-latitudes between the subpolar and subtropical gyres in the North Atlantic, making them interesting oceanographic transition zones where different water masses, {{flora and fauna}} mix. Their boundaries expand, contract and shift position in response to fluctuations in climate variability. In this study, positive and negative NAO scenarios are used {{as a proxy for}} climate variability in these regions. A three-dimensional circulation and ecosystem model is adapted for the Western Irish Shelf, and the Spring circulation and bloom dynamics are diagnosed for idealized NAO scenarios. The flow regime and modeled dynamics of the Winter/Spring bloom for the Western Irish Shelf are compared with previous work for the Georges Bank/Gulf of Maine region. ^ Modeled circulation of the Western Irish Shelf reveals recirculation features over the <b>Porcupine</b> <b>Bank</b> which may be driven by Taylor column physics and are sensitive to variability in mean flow. Analysis of time and length scales for advection highlight that two distinct flow regimes exist over the Porcupine Bank: in the southern <b>Porcupine</b> <b>Bank,</b> advective scales are much larger than Georges Bank, nonlinearity is not important, and the flow can be treated as linear; in the northern <b>Porcupine</b> <b>Bank,</b> advective scales are small and are comparable with Georges Bank, and nonlinearity is important. Taylor column flow formation over the <b>Porcupine</b> <b>Bank</b> in Spring may contribute to isolating nutrient rich water and enabling localized growth of phytoplankton. Variability in physical forcing influences the timing and intensity of the modeled Spring phytoplankton bloom. During a negative NAO period, weaker, variable springtime winds, increased light and warmer water temperatures, contribute to the mixed layer shoaling earlier in the year, and the onset of stratification, supporting favorable conditions for photosynthesis to take place and an earlier Spring bloom. During a positive NAO period, stronger, westerly springtime winds, reduced light and cooler water temperatures, delay shoaling of the mixed layer and the onset of stratification, leading to a later and less intense Spring bloom. ...|$|E

40|$|An {{overview}} of preliminary {{results from a}} series of recent Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) dives on the deep-water coral provinces of the <b>Porcupine</b> <b>Bank,</b> Irish continental margin, NE Atlantic is presented. The <b>Porcupine</b> <b>Bank</b> exhibits numerous giant carbonate mounds (up to 100 s of metres in height) that occur predominantly, although not exclusively, on topographic ridges. The results revealed that, although these ridges have a tectonic origin, contemporaneous activity is typified by erosion due to strong hydrodynamic controls. The carbonate mounds are colonized by a variety of suspension feeders and associated fauna including framework-building corals (e. g., Lophelia pertusa and Madrepora oculata) although dense coral reef-like fauna coverage is not evident at present. The ecology of the carbonate mounds varied widely. Sessile megafauna, such as sponges, gorgonians and framework-building corals (e. g., Lophelia pertusa), were abundant on some of the carbonate mounds. Other mounds were relatively barren and appeared to be undergoing a natural senescence, with a much lower biomass of megafauna than is typical of shallow-water coral reefs.

A strong cohort was manifest in 2001, and it could be tracked over time by age matrices obtained with illicia age–length keys (ALKs) collected during the surveys. However, a mismatch in the cohort analysis suggests that the growth pattern based on illicia underestimates around three of the younger age classes. Using an ALK estimated numerically from a faster growth model, this mismatch disappears, which seems to confirm faster growth. Recruits of the 0 -group and adults of age 4 (with the faster growth: ca. 57 – 65 cm) dominated, whereas the intermediate age groups were scarce on the bank.
