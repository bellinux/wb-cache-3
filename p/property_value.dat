5|$|In April 1950, the State Council of Parks met in Ardsley. Bronxville {{opposed the}} construction, {{claiming}} {{that there would}} be <b>property</b> <b>value</b> depreciation. However, there was no cited opposition for the parkway from any communities further north of Bronxville, and that officials from Westchester County were looking into ideas for an alternate route around Bronxville. At the time, the county had most of the right-of-way in Bronxville claimed, short of one piece. The need for the parkway was helped by the fact that widening of the Bronx River Parkway was not applicable due to land limitations and the prohibitory cost of acquiring land for a widening. The parkway, while creating a needed connection between the Saw Mill River Parkway and the Bronx River Parkway, would not answer the need for diverting traffic off the Hawthorne Circle and the issue {{of what to do with}} truck traffic. The parkway, if started, would take about three years to complete and would be constructed by the Taconic State Park Commission.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} correlation between incivilities, indicators of urban blight, and single-family residential <b>property</b> <b>values</b> in the City of Richmond, Virginia. Through the utilization of a mixed methods research methodology, this dissertation assesses whether specific incivilities, structural characteristics of properties, or community demographics have an adverse influence on <b>property</b> <b>values.</b> Three separate methodologies were utilized in this research including a time series assessment, focus group and individual interviews, and a cross sectional design. The findings from the time series analysis indicate that <b>property</b> <b>values</b> increased every year over a five year period {{and that there were}} variances in <b>property</b> <b>values</b> throughout the City. The qualitative interviews suggested that the location of a property and features of the area heavily influence its value. Higher quality of life amenities tend to have a positive influence on <b>property</b> <b>values</b> and lower quality of life amenities tend to have a negative influence on <b>property</b> <b>values.</b> Incivilities, poverty, and crime were considered attributes of an area that adversely influence <b>property</b> <b>values.</b> The cross sectional analysis suggested that the socio-economics of the area tended to have a stronger correlation to <b>property</b> <b>values</b> than incivilities. Indicators of a high socio-economic status generally had a strong, positive correlation to <b>property</b> <b>values</b> and indicators of a low socio-economic status tended to have a strong, negative correlation to <b>property</b> <b>values.</b> Incivilities, in general, tended to have a moderately weak, negative correlation to <b>property</b> <b>values.</b> The research argues to not overlook but to assess multiple structural and neighborhood factors when examining community conditions. Such an assessment should be conducted at an intimate geographic level rather than a broad, city wide level. From an academic perspective this dissertation fills a hollowness in the empirical literature on the correlation of incivilities to <b>property</b> <b>values.</b> From a practical standpoint, the research provides a renewed lens in which to conceptualize and assess urban conditions and its impressions on communities. Together, this dissertation aids in assessing incivilities and other socio economic conditions {{to one of the most}} pervasive challenges facing municipalities in the 21 st century - the economic stagnation and decline of residential <b>property</b> <b>values...</b>|$|R
