40|$|Simplified {{guidelines}} for the emergency care of children {{have been developed to}} improve the triage and rapid initiation of appropriate emergency treatments for children presenting to hospitals in developing countries. The guidelines are part of the effort to improve referral level paediatric care within the World Health Organisation/Unicef strategy integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI), based on evidence of significant deficiencies in triage and emergency care. Existing emergency guidelines have been modified according to resource limitations and significant differences in the epidemiology of severe <b>paediatric</b> <b>illness</b> and preventable death in developing countries with raised infant and child mortality rates. In these settings, it is important to address the emergency management of diarrhoea with severe dehydration, severe malaria, severe malnutrition, and severe bacterial pneumonia, and to focus attention on sick infants younger than 2 months of age. The triage assessment relies on a few clinical signs, which can be readily taught {{so that it can be}} used by health workers with limited clinical background. The assessment has been designed so that it can be carried out quickly if negative, making it functional for triaging children in queues. ...|$|E

40|$|Background: Many <b>paediatric</b> <b>illnesses</b> {{are caused}} by viral agents, for example, acute gastroenteritis. Electron {{microscopy}} can provide images of viral particles {{and can be used}} to identify the agents. Objectives: The use of electron microscopy as a diagnostic tool is limited by the need for high level of expertise in interpreting these images and the time required. A semi-automated method is proposed in this paper. Study design: The method is based on bispectal features that capture contour and texture information while providing robustness to shift, rotation, changes in size and noise. The magnification or true size of the viral particles need not be known precisely, but if available can be used additionally for improved classification. Viral particles from one or more images are segmented and analyzed to verify whether they belong to a particular class (such as Adenovirus, Rotavirus, etc.) or not. Two experiments were conducted—depending on the populations from which virus particle images were collected for training and testing, respectively. In the first, disjoint subsets from a pooled population of virus particles obtained from several images were used. In the second, separate populations from separate images were used. The performance of the method on viruses of similar size was separately evaluated using Astrovirus, HAV and Poliovirus. A Gaussian Mixture Model was used for the probability density of the features. A threshold on the log-likelihood is varied to study false alarm and false rejection trade-off. Features from many particles and/or likelihoods from independent tests are averaged to yield better performance. Results: An equal error rate (EER) of 2...|$|R

40|$|Bacterial infections of the {{respiratory}} tract remain {{a major cause}} of morbidity and death in both developed and developing countries. Seven microbes are responsible for virtually all bacterial infections: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Corynebacterium diphtheriae and Bordetella pertussis. All of these microbes establish infection at the site of {{the respiratory}} mucosa, however the pathogenesis of disease varies. Some, such as B. pertussis are obligate pathogens whilst others, such as H. influenzae, are commensals of the upper respiratory tract. The burden of disease falls across all age groups - from young children to the elderly. In recent years the widespread use of antibiotics has had a significant impact on limiting serious complications that arise from these infections and in reducing mortality, particularly in developed countries. However, increased bacterial resistance to chemotherapy is evident and a major concern for the long-term application of this therapeutic approach. Effective vaccines have been developed for some pneumococcal and haemophilus infections, diphtheria and whooping cough. In developing countries access to these vaccines presents a problem for their widespread and equitable distribution. In developed countries anti-vaccine lobby groups, controversy over the expense of routine scheduling of the pneumococcal vaccine and complacency in the absence of endemic disease are significant frustrations for national immunisation programs. In a review of this nature it is not possible to address all seven bacteria and their clinical manifestations. Instead, otitis media, the most common <b>paediatric</b> <b>illness</b> for which medical advice is sought in the developed world, is provided as a case study.

Laronidase {{was approved by the}} US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency in 2003 and by the Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency in 2005. Many Brazilian MPS I patients have been receiving laronidase despite the absence of a governmental policy regulating access to the drug. Epidemiological and treatment data concerning MPS I are scarce. This study aims to present a demographic profile of Brazilian patients with MPS I, describe the routes of access to laronidase in Brazil, and discuss associated ethical issues relating to public funding of orphan drugs. Methods In this cross-sectional observational study, data were collected nationwide between January and September 2008 from physicians, public institutions and non-governmental organisations involved with diagnosis and treatment of MPS I, using two data collection instruments specifically designed for this purpose. Results The minimum prevalence of MPS I in Brazil was estimated at 1 / 2   700   000. Most patients (69. 8 %) were younger than 15  years; 60 (88. 2 %) received laronidase. The most common route of access to the drug was through lawsuits (86. 6 %). Conclusions In Brazil, MPS I is predominantly a <b>paediatric</b> <b>illness.</b> Even though the cost of laronidase treatment is not officially covered by the Brazilian government, most MPS I patients receive the drug, usually through litigation.

40|$|The {{connected}} world: Shared Paramedic Learning Across the UK and Gibraltar: Wimba Live Classroom St Georges University of London (SGUL) {{has delivered}} a foundation degree in paramedic science since 2004. Since {{the inception of}} the programme, cohort numbers have grown. Students are now based in a variety of locations across the UK and in Gibraltar. We are seeing an increasing number of students come into the course from a range of backgrounds including nursing, military and care support. The number of ambulance services working in partnership with SGUL is increasing and now includes the Gibraltar ambulance service. Paramedic higher education is a relatively new pathway with very little evidence to support effective profession specific pedagogy. To accommodate for the increasing diversity and distance challenges Wimba Live Classroom has been employed to host a series of shared learning sessions that are open to all cohorts. Above and beyond the core module content the sessions are hosted by a paramedic lecturer with content delivery by both staff and students on a range of themes. Students are able to interact with the presentations using voice, text or a series of visual images to infer feedback during the session. Sessions delivered so far include case examples of <b>paediatric</b> <b>illness,</b> an overview of the Gibraltar ambulance service and an introduction to diving medicine. This has led to increased dialogue between traditionally separated cohorts and a learning community that encourages open, shared learning that takes advantage of the diverse backgrounds of the students. The use of students to present sessions on areas of interest promotes mentorship and leadership principles which have become a core part {{of the role of the}} professional paramedic. An online questionnaire evaluation was distributed to the students and has shown positive response from all cohorts that have been involved. Although the students generally do not feel it should be a replacement for face to face teaching, they do feel it is a valuable addition. Particular strengths were identified to be a platform to share learning and particularly for the Gibraltar students a sense of integration into the UK based programme. Students have demonstrated that the case based approach to the sessions help to promote their clinical understanding of paramedic practice. The success of the Live Classroom sessions has helped to reach beyond the UK borders to assist in delivering teaching and learning to a small cohort of ambulance staff in Gibraltar. Simultaneously it has created a shared lecturer and peer led learning community that plays on the strengths of a diverse student group. With increasing interest in educating paramedics overseas, the Wimba Live Classroom could be an integral part in the teaching and learning strategy of international paramedic education...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate an observation-based, educational intervention program aimed at improving previously acquired knowledge and confidence in managing critical illnesses. Methods A prospective cohort longitudinal study was conducted over a 6 month period. Participants were assessed with a knowledge based questionnaire immediately prior to and after observing 12 fortnightly critical illness scenario demonstrations (CISD). The outcome measure was performance on questionnaires. Regression analysis was used to adjust for potential confounders. Questionnaire practice effect was evaluated on 30 independent HCPs not exposed to the CISDs. Results Fifty-four HCPs (40 doctors and 14 nurses) participated in the study. All participants had previously attended nationally accredited simulation courses with a mean time since last attendance of 1. 8 ± 0. 4 years. The median number of attendances at CISD was 6 [2 - 12]. The mean questionnaire scores at baseline (17. 2 / 25) were significantly lower than the mean post intervention questionnaire scores (20. 3 / 25), p= 0. 003.

40|$|Abstract Aim: The study {{investigated}} whether {{having a child}} with diabetes impacts on family functioning at mealtimes compared to a comparison group. Background: Dietary recommendations are {{an important aspect of}} many <b>paediatric</b> chronic <b>illness</b> treatment regimes (Spieth et al 2001). This is particularly the case for children with Type one Diabetes Mellitus (T 1 DM). Evidence found that parents of young children with T 1 DM commonly report mealtimes and adherence to the diabetes dietary recommendations to be among the most difficult component of their child’s care. It is clear from the previous research that some families perceive mealtimes and nutrition management as challenging (Powers et al 2002). However, the studies were conducted in America and it is hard to generalise the findings to the United Kingdom. Method: This study took a quantitative approach by administering a questionnaire, adapted from the About Your Child’s Eating Revised (AYCE-R) by Davies et al (1993) with additional questions about family eating habits and the possible cause of mealtime concern. Parents were approached to participate in this study over a 3 month period at a paediatric diabetes clinic (diabetes group) and endocrine clinic (comparison group) in a large teaching hospital in the East Midlands. Results: In the families with a diabetic child there was a degree of worse habits and behaviours at mealtimes. However, the results from the Mann Whitney U test revealed {{no significant differences between the}} scores on the AYCE-R measure in those families with a diabetic child and those of the comparison group. Conclusions: The results of this research are inconclusive. A study with a larger sample size is needed as this may provide more evident findings and in turn provide a greater understanding and knowledge of this subject area...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{comprises}} of {{two parts}} aiming to explore family members’ experiences of living with {{a child who has}} a <b>paediatric</b> chronic <b>illness</b> (PCI) and one part that also reflects on the research process. The systematic review utilised a thematic meta-synthesis approach to analyse 12 studies, consulting 373 healthy siblings regarding their experiences of living with a PCI. The synthesis resulted in two themes. The first theme was ‘Changing relationships’ which had two sub-themes: ‘Changing family relationships’ and ‘Changing relationship to self’. The second theme was ‘Managing changes’ which had three sub-themes: ‘Coping and acceptance’, ‘Support from friends peers and support groups’ and ‘Negative reactions from others’. Siblings were found to adopt new roles, new skills and eventually develop a new ‘prosocial’ identity in order to find more socially acceptable ways to meet their needs and the needs of the family. The research paper explored parents’ stories of adjustment to having a son with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Narrative analysis was applied to seven semi-structured interviews of five women and two men. The analysis identified key narrative elements from their stories that were then collated into demographics and contextual data, individual summary stories and three common chapters: ‘Investigating and fighting: “Something’s not right”’; ‘Making meaning of the diagnosis’; and ‘Living a normal life’. Parents explored narratives relating to acute and chronic illness, altering their identity from parent to carer and providing a normal and happy life for their son. Finally, a critical appraisal of the research reflected on the use of qualitative research in health settings and how the associated issues applied to this thesis. Epistemology was used as the lens to view how decisions in the research were made, in particular highlighting the importance of quality, the debate regarding validity and identifying relevant future research...|$|R

Aim {{of this study was to}} assess the effects of social and geographical determinants on the risk of bacteraemia in a rural-urban transition zone in Ghana. Children below 15 years of age with fever were recruited at an outpatient department in the suburban belt of Kumasi, Ghana's second largest city. Blood was taken for bacterial culture and malaria diagnostics. The socio-economic status of participants was calculated using Principle Component Analysis. A scale, based on key urban characteristics, was established to quantify urbanicity for all communities in the hospital catchment area. A case-control analysis was conducted, where children with and without bacteraemia were cases and controls, respectively. Bacteraemia was detected in 72 (3. 1 %) of 2, 306 hospital visits. Non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS; n = 24; 33. 3 %) and Salmonella typhi (n = 18; 25. 0 %) were the most common isolates. Logistic regression analysis showed that bacteraemia was negatively associated with urbanicity (odds ratio [OR] = 0. 8; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 7 - 1. 0) and socio-economic status (OR = 0. 8; 95 % CI: 0. 6 - 0. 9).

This qualitative feasibility study aims to explore: acceptability of the proposed pilot RCT, including the prospect of research without prior consent (RWPC); other potential barriers to conduct of the pilot RCT; participant information; parental decision-making; and patientcentred outcome measures. Methods Qualitative interview study involving 21 parents (18 mothers, 3 fathers, 7 were bereaved) with children admitted to a UK emergency department with presumed septic shock in the last three years. Results All parents would have provided permission for the use of their child’s data in the FiSh pilot RCT. The majority of parents were unfamiliar with RWPC, yet supported its use in FiSh and in other RCTs aiming to help improve treatments for critically ill children. Parents were concerned about the change from currently recommended treatment; yet were reassured by an explanation of the current evidence base, fluid bolus therapy and monitoring procedures. Parents made recommendations about the timing of the discussion regarding permission for use of data and the patient information materials. Bereaved parents stated that recruiters should not attempt to discuss the RCT immediately after a child’s death, but supported a personalised postal ‘opt out’ approach to RWPC for FiSh. Parents prioritised outcome measures such as survival, time in hospital, time spent on machines and time to their child ‘looking or behaving more like themselves’. Conclusion Our qualitative feasibility study findings support the proposed FiSh pilot RCT, including the use of RWPC, amongst parents whose child has experienced septic shock. Our findings will inform the FiSh RCT including selection of a patient centred outcome measure, as well as inform development of participant information materials and site initiation training...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{systematic}} literature review was to gain an in-depth understanding of how {{parents of children with}} an autism spectrum diagnosis experience stigma and in what ways they might manage this. Electronic databases and reference lists of published articles were systematically searched and six qualitative articles were selected for inclusion in the review. Findings from the studies formed the data for a thematic synthesis. Four interconnected themes were identified which capture parents experience of stigma: parent blame/responsibility; hidden disability; diagnosis/label and social isolation/avoidance. A further four themes were identified to highlight ways in which parents may manage this: diagnosis as a weapon; celebrating; increased resilience over time and planning and avoidance. The review suggests that negotiating public spaces may continue to be a challenge for some parents who experience both felt and enacted stigma. The aim {{of the study was to}} explore how parents share an autism spectrum diagnosis with their child and the processes which may be involved in this. Literature regarding parental experiences of autism assessment and diagnosis indicate that this is a highly emotive time for both parent and child and highlights multiple factors which may impact on the sharing process. There is also an indication in the literature that there is often a delay between the autism diagnosis being confirmed and this being shared with the child. In the absence of autism specific research, literature pertaining to diagnosis disclosure in developmental disabilities and in <b>paediatric</b> chronic <b>illness</b> is examined, outlining a range of emotional and social factors which may shape parental decisions of whether to share their child’s diagnosis with them. The researcher adopted a critical realist position and employed a qualitative approach to explore this under-researched area. A total of 10 parents were recruited to the study and participated in a semi-structured interview. Transcribed interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. A secondary thematic analysis was undertaken to produce a leaflet reflecting the accounts shared by the group of parents in the study. It is hoped that this may be useful to other parents who are contemplating sharing an autism spectrum diagnosis with their child and the professionals who support them. Three inter-connected themes were identified, each with further sub-themes: (1) Sharing is a process: naming autism, exploring and meaning-making and acceptance and integration; (2) Parental motivation to share: providing an explanation and protection and (3) Parental management of sharing: parental preparedness, perceived child preparedness and approach and strategies. Sharing is a process and its related sub-themes are discussed in the journal paper, whilst the remaining themes and sub-themes are presented in the extended paper. The findings illustrate that sharing an autism diagnosis with one’s child is a complex and dynamic process involving the balancing of many parent, child and social factors. Commonalities with previous literature are discussed alongside some alternative insights gained. The thesis concludes with personal reflections of aspects of the research process including the nature of autism as a diagnosis and the potential ethical issues raised when considering whether this is shared with children or not...|$|R
40|$|Thalassemia major is a recessively {{inherited}} haematological disorder, {{which involves}} a complete lack or reduction of beta protein in the hemoglobin, causing life-threatening anemia. Management requires patients to have life-long {{access to a}} treatment regimen of fortnightly blood transfusions and daily chelation therapy, imposing major demands on children and their families. Much of the {{research in the area}} of <b>paediatric,</b> chronic <b>illnesses</b> such as thalassemia major has investigated psychosocial impact and adjustment to the illness. However, the lived experiences of children and their families and the meanings assigned to these experiences have received little empirical attention. Additionally, the experiences of specialist healthcare professionals have been particularly neglected. Despite the high prevalence of thalassemia in Pakistan, the majority of existing research has been conducted in Western countries. Therefore, the present research adopted a multi-perspective approach, to explore the experiences of key people involved in thalassemia in Pakistan, namely, children, their mothers and healthcare professionals. Study 1 explored the experiences of 12 children (aged 8 - 12 years) living with thalassemia, viewing them as active agents (Prout & James, 1997). Studies 2 and 3 explored the experiences of their mothers (N= 12) and healthcare professionals (N= 4) as the primary and professional caregivers, respectively. All of the participants were recruited from a treatment centre in Multan, Pakistan. Each of these groups were studied in two phases; in phase 1, five focus groups and two role-plays (with children only) were conducted and analysed using thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006). The purpose of phase 1 was to obtain an understanding of the participants’ core concerns in order to develop the interview guide for phase 2, which aimed to provide an in-depth understanding of these experiences. In phase 2, 28 in-depth individual interviews were conducted with each participant in all three groups and analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). For study 1, the findings consisted of three superordinate themes: ‘Loss of normal childhood’, ‘Minimizing differences’, and ‘Redefining self’. These themes were interrelated and reflected the burden of living with thalassemia and the wide array of coping strategies used by children living with thalassemia. Study 2 (mothers) resulted in four superordinate themes. Across the first two themes; ‘Living with a chronic heartache’ and ‘Child becomes the focal point’, mothers shared the difficulties associated with being a primary caregiver. The remaining two themes; ‘Focus on normalization’ and ‘Vigilant parenting’ were reflective of the coping strategies adopted by mothers to deal with caregiving stress. The findings of study 3 with healthcare professionals were composed of four superordinate themes where the first two themes; ‘Making sense of work-related frustrations’, and ‘Blurring of boundaries’ shed light on the frustrations, helplessness, emotional distress and dilemmas of professional caregiving. In particular, the healthcare professionals related the tension between empathetic behaviour and distress. The latter two themes; ‘Seeking satisfaction’, and ‘Ascertaining and re-ascertaining boundaries’ illustrated the coping efforts of the healthcare professionals to address the stress of professional caregiving. The current research provides unique insights and expands our understanding of the experiences of the main people directly involved with the illness. The findings of all three studies revealed a complex interplay of themes, which highlight the fluctuating and dynamic nature of attempts to manage the condition and caregiving, and which is in contrast to the progressive, linear approaches of adjustment often employed in the chronic illness literature. Participants vacillated between feeling overwhelmed by the burden of illness/caregiving and adaptation. This vacillation was influenced by their personal and social setting; any change in these contexts could potentially disrupt the coping process. The findings also elucidate the paradoxes of coping efforts since, at times, coping itself contributed towards the burden associated with thalassemia major/caregiving. Moreover, the coping strategies of the participants in all three groups remained vulnerable. The multi-perspective account was achieved by comparing the the experiences of children, mothers and the healthcare professionals at the group level. It highlighted various similarities as well as differences in the accounts of the participants in the three groups. It revealed a complex interaction between their experiences and described how coping strategies/stress of one group was sometimes perceived as stress-inducing by the other group. Such insights highlight the importance of a multi-perspective approach, which allowed the identification of areas for improvement in healthcare provision. The theoretical, methodological and practical implications of the current research are discussed...|$|R
