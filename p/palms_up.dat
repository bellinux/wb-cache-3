500|$|The album's title also {{evolves into}} a {{reference}} to the political corruption and general social mistrust pervading contemporary Colombian society. The album cover features a photo of her, soot-covered <b>palms</b> <b>up,</b> caught with her hands dirty. Shakira explained the cover, saying, [...] "rom that point of view, we all have stolen at one time or another, myself included. The dirty hands [...] represent the shared guilt. No one is completely clean, in the end we are all accomplices". In keeping with her increasingly rocker sound, for this album she left her hair loose and messy and filled it up with little colorful braids, looking like a [...] "modern Medusa" [...] according to biographer Ximena Diego. Following the album's commercial success, girls from several countries were copying Shakira's style, colorfully braiding their hair and wearing friendship bracelets.|$|E

2500|$|Plutarch (c. 46–120 CE) {{mentions}} the practice, as do Tertullian, Orosius, Diodorus Siculus and Philo. Livy and Polybius do not. The Bible asserts that children were sacrificed {{at a place}} called the tophet ("roasting place") to the god Moloch. According to Diodorus Siculus' Bibliotheca historica, [...] "There was in their city a bronze image of Cronus extending its hands, <b>palms</b> <b>up</b> and sloping toward the ground, so that each of the children when placed thereon rolled down and fell into a sort of gaping pit filled with fire." ...|$|E
60|$|Stephen {{knelt down}} quickly {{pressing}} his beaten {{hands to his}} sides. To think of them beaten and swollen with pain all in a moment made him feel so sorry for {{them as if they}} were not his own but someone else's that he felt sorry for. And as he knelt, calming the last sobs in his throat and feeling the burning tingling pain pressed into his sides, he thought of the hands which he had held out in the air with the <b>palms</b> <b>up</b> and of the firm touch of the prefect of studies when he had steadied the shaking fingers and of the beaten swollen reddened mass of palm and fingers that shook helplessly in the air.|$|E
60|$|Valrosa well {{deserved}} its name, for in {{that climate}} of perpetual summer roses blossomed everywhere. They overhung the archway, thrust themselves between {{the bars of}} the great gate with a sweet welcome to passers-by, and lined the avenue, winding through lemon trees and feathery <b>palms</b> <b>up</b> to the villa on the hill. Every shadowy nook, where seats invited one to stop and rest, was a mass of bloom, every cool grotto had its marble nymph smiling from a veil of flowers and every fountain reflected crimson, white, or pale pink roses, leaning down to smile at their own beauty. Roses covered the walls of the house, draped the cornices, climbed the pillars, and ran riot over the balustrade of the wide terrace, whence one looked down on the sunny Mediterranean, and the white-walled city on its shore.|$|E

50|$|Technique: Over-rotated {{forearm and}} wrist. Rotation of the forearm in a supinated {{position}} (<b>palm</b> <b>up)</b> and/or wrist flexion increases the fluid {{pressure in the}} carpal tunnel. This increased pressure can result in compression of soft tissues like nerves, tendons and blood vessels, causing numbness in the thumb and fingers.|$|R
5000|$|A {{extends his}} or her hands forward, roughly at arm's length, with the palms down. B's hand, also roughly at arm's length, are placed, <b>palms</b> <b>up,</b> under A's hands.

50|$|In {{subsequent}} Christian traditions, certain physical gestures are emphasized, including medieval gestures such as genuflection {{or making}} {{the sign of}} the cross. Kneeling, bowing and prostrations (see also poklon) are often practiced in more traditional branches of Christianity. Frequently in Western Christianity the hands are placed palms together and forward as in the feudal commendation ceremony. At other times the older orans posture may be used, with <b>palms</b> <b>up</b> and elbows in.|$|E
50|$|Sembah is an Indonesian {{greeting}} and gesture {{as a way}} {{of demonstrating}} respect and reverence. While performing the sembah, the person clasped their palms together solemnly in a prayer-like fashion called suhun or susuhun in Javanese; or menyusun jari sepuluh ("to arrange the ten fingers") in Indonesian, and placed them in front of the chest, and moving the combined <b>palms</b> <b>up</b> to the chin, or all the way up until the thumbs touching the tip of the nose, while bowing slightly.|$|E

40|$|In bimanual {{coordination}} subjects typically show {{a spontaneous}} preference for movement symmetry. While there is experimental {{evidence for the}} principle of muscle homology, recent evidence suggested that bimanual coordination may be mediated as perceptual goals (Mechsner et al., 2001). To explore this controversy we performed a fMRI study in 11 healthy, right-handed subjects using bimanual index finger abductions and adductions in a congruous condition, i. e. both palms down, and incongruous conditions with either {{the left or right}} <b>palm</b> <b>up.</b> Our fMRI data showed a widespread bihemispheric network mediating proprioceptive coordination of the two hands with significant differences mainly for a perceptual dissociation: in the incongruous conditions with the one <b>palm</b> <b>up</b> there was a BOLD signal increase in a bilateral frontoparietal network involving the motor and premotor cortical areas, particularly in the right palm-up condition. These results accord with the notion that perceptual cues {{play an important role in}} the control of bilateral hand movement...|$|R
