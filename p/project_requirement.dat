2500|$|Eagle Scout {{requirements}} {{have evolved}} since the award was conceived. A requirement to earn 11 specific merit badges was added in 1914, which underwent minor changes in 1915. The Life–Star order was reversed in 1924, apparently because the five-pointed {{star of the}} Star Scout insignia could {{be associated with the}} five merit badges required to earn the rank immediately following First Class Scout. In 1927, Eagle Scout began the transition from being a super merit badge to a rank. As a result, the first requirements for tenure were created and Scouts were required to be an active First Class Scout for one year. The initial requirements for what became the service project appeared with a requirement to show satisfactory service and the number of required merit badges increased to 12. In 1936, the ranks of Star and Life became mandatory, and the number of required merit badges rose to 13. It was at this time that Eagle Scout became a full-fledged rank. In 1952, age limits were set so that adults over 18 years of age could no longer earn Eagle Scout and the service <b>project</b> <b>requirement</b> was slightly expanded to [...] "do your best to help in your home, school, church or synagogue, and community." [...] In 1958, the number of required merit badges increased again to 16 of the 21 total merit badges needed to obtain Eagle, along with the first requirements for service and leadership.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Before {{starting}} software projects proper {{cost estimation}} for accu-rate project planning and staffing is required. The <b>project</b> <b>requirements,</b> which are normally not well {{defined in the}} early stage of a project, need to be consid-ered carefully for a comprehensive calculation. In order to discuss and under-stand the <b>project</b> <b>requirements,</b> Mock-Ups or Prototypes are often used, as they provide the possibility of analyzing the potential customer’s requirements. Be-cause they show the way the software works and how they {{get in touch with}} it, Mock-Ups are a suitable approach for visualizing needs. In this paper we pro-pose a method using Mock-Ups not only to understand and discuss the <b>project</b> <b>requirements</b> but for proper cost estimation. For achieving this, we use the se-mantically enriched Mock-Up elements for cost estimation...|$|R

40|$|Greedy and {{optimization}} approaches {{used for}} assigning trainees to software project requirements can {{give rise to}} unstable pairs. The presence of unstable pairs can unnecessarily hamper both trainee and <b>project</b> <b>requirement</b> satisfaction. In this paper, we use the theory of stable matching to remove the unstable pairs. We propose an efficient method to predict preferences for both trainees and project requirements using the utility theory. Our computational experiments suggest that the stable matching approach performs better with average trainee and <b>project</b> <b>requirement</b> satisfaction {{in terms of the}} preference ranks of allocated choices. Compared to cost based optimization model, the proposed approach obtains significantly better trainee project match at the expense of small additional allocation cost. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>project</b> selection and <b>requirements</b> analysis is important, yet {{has not received}} much attention. The decisions made during project selection directly affect and frame a <b>project’s</b> <b>requirements</b> analysis. In current practice, {{it is expected that}} requirements analysis begins after project selection has occurred. Yet, we know little empirically about the procedural {{relationship between}} <b>project</b> selection and <b>requirements</b> analysis. We performed a field study to examine in detail how project selection is performed and what procedural relationship, if any, exists between <b>project</b> selection and <b>requirements</b> analysis. We found, contrary to the common view of requirements engineering practice, that requirements analysis occurred in multiple parallel streams. We observed that requirements analysis helped define the initial project choices. In addition, as the project selection process progressed, each candidate <b>project’s</b> <b>requirements</b> were further refined. We call this process multiple parallel competitive requirements analysis (MPCRA). We argue that MPCRA should be considered as a viable alternative to current requirements engineering practices, especially for determining and designing large-scale complex projects. 1...|$|R
