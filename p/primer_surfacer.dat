40|$|Synchrotron FTIR {{microspectroscopy}} {{was used}} to characterise and assess the chemical diversity of electrocoat primer, <b>primer</b> <b>surfacer</b> and basecoats of automotive paint samples from 75 vehicles representing a range of international car manufacturers. Significant diversity {{was found in the}} synchrotron FTIR data from the <b>primer</b> <b>surfacer</b> coats. Classification using principal component analysis revealed 14 discrete groups, which could be associated with the country of manufacture, the specific manufacturer and manufacturing plant, the year of manufacture of the vehicle and in some instances the number of layers in the paint system. The model generated from the <b>primer</b> <b>surfacer</b> was significantly more discriminating than a previous model generated from FTIR analysis of clear coats of the same vehicles. Analysis of the <b>primer</b> <b>surfacer</b> also avoids issues of possible environmental degradation and component migration seen with FTIR analysis of automotive clear coats. Providing such information concerning vehicle origin would aid in the development of investigative leads from the analysis of questioned automotive paint samples located at the scene of a crime or on the body/clothing of a hit and run victim...|$|E
40|$|Allyl-functionalized triazines, {{especially}} TAICROS® {{were used}} as crosslinking additives in novel UV-curing clear coats. It could be evidenced that TAICROS®, as a key component in the radiation curing formulations, has {{a positive effect on}} important properties like acid- and alkaline resistance, adhesion, hardness and scratch-resistance. The UV-curing clear coats were protected by the addition of hindered amine light stabilizers (HALS), as well as UV-absorbers and applied on state of the art OEM systems, consisting of e-coat, <b>primer</b> <b>surfacer</b> and base coat layers. Finally, UV-curing clear coats, which can be regarded as starting formulations, to adapt the mechanical and adhesion properties to the existing automotive coating systems on the market, were established...|$|E
40|$|Novel UV-curing clear coats with {{outstanding}} properties were developed. As a {{key component}} in the radiation curing formulations, allyl-functionalized triazines, especially TAICROS® in combination with Desmolux® XP 2738 and trimethylolpropane triacrylate TMPTA were used. The UV-curing clearcoats were UV-protected {{by the addition of}} hindered amine light stabilizers (HALS), as well as UV-absorbers and applied as a last layer of an OEM system, consisting of an e-coat, a <b>primer</b> <b>surfacer</b> and a basecoat. It was found that TAICROS® has a positive effect on such important properties of a UV-curing clear coat as chemical resistance, adhesion, hardness and scratch-resistance. Based on these findings, TAICROS® can be regarded as a valuable component for the adjustment of the chemical, mechanical and adhesive properties of both already existing as well as new formulations of UV-curable clearcoats...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} measure the {{thickness}} of paint on graphite/epoxy composite structures directly would be of benefit in the aerospace industry. The weight reduction would increase fuel mileage for the airline customer. An additional reason for reducing the thickness of paint on graphite/epoxy composites is not as obvious as the weight savings. A concern {{in the use of}} composite structures has been the effect of paint chipping after 2 to 3 years of service life. It has been postulated that the primary cause has been the application of <b>surfacer</b> or <b>primer.</b> The primer is less plastic than the top layer of paint and cracks form as the primer goes through temperature cycles. If the <b>primer</b> or <b>surfacer</b> is too thick, the crazing is more likely than with thinner applications of <b>primer</b> or <b>surfacer...</b>|$|R
40|$|Vehicle coating is an {{important}} component of automotive manufacturing. The paint shop constitutes the plurality of initial investment in an automotive assembly plant, consumes the majority of energy used in the plant's operation, and generates significant waste from paint overspray. The coating process also results in the emission of polluting volatile organic compounds (VOCs). New paint technologies based upon powder coatings offer reductions in VOC emissions along with potentially reduced energy usage and the ability to reuse paint overspray. However, quantification of these advantages requires clear understanding of the life cycle costs associated with each paint technology, modeled over the decades-long time horizons within which a paint shop operates. Life cycle cost models go beyond acquisition cost to consider all relevant cost drivers for a given system. This includes obvious candidates such as investment and operating costs, but also may include more subtle factors such as costs associated with variation, disruption, or flexibility, hereafter referred to as hidden costs. (cont.) In this thesis, methods for estimating these costs for a paint shop are explored. First, the development of a life cycle cost modeling tool, capable of quickly forecasting investment and operating costs and testing the sensitivity of life cycle cost to changes in input costs, is discussed. This tool is then used to compare the life cycle cost of three different <b>primer</b> <b>surfacer</b> application technologies. Next, the potential impact of hidden costs on life cycle cost for manufacturing systems are investigated, both through real-world examples and simulations. Finally, this thesis explores the wider implications of a shift to life cycle cost analysis for General Motors, in terms of both internal and external relationships for the Global Paint and Polymers Center at General Motors, and identifies situations in which a focus on life cycle cost can bolster managerial objectives. by Christopher W.
