2500|$|The {{economics}} of a depression were the spur {{for the creation}} of [...] "macroeconomics" [...] as a separate discipline field of study. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, John Maynard Keynes authored a book entitled The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money outlining the key theories of Keynesian economics. Keynes contended that aggregate demand for goods might be insufficient during economic downturns, leading to unnecessarily high unemployment and losses of <b>potential</b> <b>output.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The gain of a {{good quality}} {{full-range}} audio amplifier will be essentially flat between 20Hz to about 20kHz (the range of normal human hearing). In ultra-high-fidelity amplifier design, the amplifier's frequency response should extend considerably beyond this (one or more octaves either side) and might have [...] points < 10nbsp&Hz and > [...] Professional touring amplifiers often have input and/or output filtering to sharply limit frequency response beyond {{too much of the}} amplifier's <b>potential</b> <b>output</b> power would otherwise be wasted on infrasonic and ultrasonic frequencies, and the danger of AM radio interference would increase. Modern switching amplifiers need steep low pass filtering at the output to get rid of high-frequency switching noise and harmonics.|$|E

50|$|In the {{conventional}} Keynesian {{use of the}} AS-AD model, the aggregate supply curve is horizontal at low levels of output and becomes inelastic near the point of <b>potential</b> <b>output,</b> which corresponds with full employment.

50|$|While general {{equilibrium}} {{theory and}} neoclassical economics generally were originally microeconomic theories, new classical macroeconomics builds a macroeconomic theory on these bases. In new classical models, the macroeconomy {{is assumed to}} be at its unique equilibrium, with full employment and <b>potential</b> <b>output,</b> and that this equilibrium is assumed to always have been achieved via price and wage adjustment (market clearing). The best-known such model is Real Business Cycle Theory, in which business cycles are considered to be largely due to changes in the real economy, unemployment is not due to the failure of the market to achieve <b>potential</b> <b>output,</b> but due to equilibrium <b>potential</b> <b>output</b> having fallen and equilibrium unemployment having risen.|$|E
