50|$|<b>Preserving</b> <b>and</b> storing foods reduces {{reliance}} on long-distance transported {{food and the}} market industry. Home-grown foods can be <b>preserved</b> <b>and</b> stored outside of their growing season and continually consumed throughout the year, enhancing self-sufficiency and independence from the supermarket. Food can be <b>preserved</b> <b>and</b> saved by dehydration, freezing, vacuum packing, canning, bottling, pickling and jellying. For more information, see food preservation.|$|R

5|$|Governments and {{conservation}} groups work to protect birds, either by passing laws that <b>preserve</b> <b>and</b> restore bird habitat or by establishing captive populations for reintroductions. Such projects have produced some successes; one study estimated that conservation efforts saved 16 species of bird {{that would otherwise}} have gone extinct between 1994 and 2004, including the California condor and Norfolk parakeet.|$|E

5|$|Canopy Development, a green {{development}} company from Northampton, Massachusetts, owns {{a portion of}} the former rail bed in Rosendale. It has agreed to establish a right-of-way, rerouting the trail to allow public access. Another obstruction between Rosendale and Ulster is a private swimming pool, which will be bypassed. The Mohonk <b>Preserve</b> <b>and</b> Open Space Conservancy were given a $20,000 state grant in March 2011 to maintain the portion of the trail by Kingston. By the end of summer 2013, the last outstanding trail segment along the Rosendale-Kingston extension was opened to the public, completing the entire 23.7 mile rail trail.|$|E

5|$|The Byzantines {{took care}} to codify, <b>preserve</b> <b>and</b> pass on the lessons of warfare at land and sea from past experience, {{through the use of}} {{military}} manuals. Despite their sometimes antiquarian terminology, these texts form the basis of our knowledge on Byzantine naval affairs. The main surviving texts are the chapters on sea combat (peri naumachias) in the Tactica of Leo the Wise and Nikephoros Ouranos (both drawing extensively from the Naumachiai of Syrianos Magistros and other earlier works), complemented by relevant passages in the De Administrando Imperio of Constantine Porphyrogennetos and other works by Byzantine and Arab writers.|$|E

The Trust also introduced workshops for other restoration professionals, academics and eventually opened them to interested members of the public, where all were educated in a hands-on environment in the skills required to repair the building. For this crafts-based training initiative, in 2011 the Trust won a Daily Telegraph sponsored English Heritage Angel Award.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} studies have been carried out on the creek and its watershed. These include the Darby Creek Stream Valley Park Master Plan in 1987 and the Greenway Plan for the Darby Creek Watershed in 2011. A $1047 Pennsylvania Growing Greener grant was given to Delco Anglers and Conservationists for {{riparian}} restoration on Darby Creek. Another Growing Greener grant, this one for $68,225, was given to Marple Township for a streambank stabilization project on the creek. Additionally, a $1000 grant from the Pennsylvania Watershed Restoration Assistance Program was given to Delco Anglers and Conservationists for riparian improvement of the creek and several other creeks. In 1997, a $60,000 grant was given to the Darby Creek Valley Association and DelCo Anglers and Conservationists for developing a conservation plan. The grant was provided by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. The Darby Creek Valley Association is an organization whose purpose is to <b>preserve</b> <b>and</b> improve the creek's watershed. It has approximately 100 members.|$|E
5|$|As {{the highway}} heads north from the {{channels}} surrounding {{the west end}} of South Oyster Bay, it runs along {{the west side of the}} Norman J. Levy Park and <b>Preserve</b> <b>and</b> the Merrick Road Park Golf Course, both of which are separated from the Meadowbrook by a small creek. The golf course leads to nearby exitM9, a cloverleaf interchange with Merrick Road (unsigned County Route27 or CR27) in the Freeport section of Hempstead. Not far to the north is exitM8, another cloverleaf serving NY27 (East Sunrise Highway). After crossing the adjacent Babylon Branch of the Long Island Rail Road, the parkway continues north across East Meadow Park to reach exitM7, a cloverleaf interchange with the Babylon Turnpike (unsigned CR7A). After exitM7, the Meadowbrook makes a slight turn to the northwest as it traverses Roosevelt Preserve County Park.|$|E

Meeting up with Dutch, the two defend an ONI base from the Covenant, destroying the facility to keep it from being captured. They are evacuated by a transport and make contact with Buck, arranging a rendezvous at police headquarters, but are shot down. Buck and Romeo rescue Dutch and Mickey, but Romeo is seriously wounded. The squad hijacks a Covenant dropship, but instead of leaving the city, Buck decides to have them turn back and find Dare.|$|E
5|$|By 1940, the {{outbreak}} of World War II forced the Szigetis to leave Europe for the United States. (Irene remained in Switzerland, having married pianist Nikita Magaloff earlier that year.) They settled in California, where Wanda, always fond of nature, was delighted {{to be able to}} raise her own garden. In a letter to a friend, Szigeti describes their California life: Wanda is happy, doing wonders with her gardening, chicken and rabbit raising, <b>preserve</b> <b>and</b> pâté de foie making. She doesn't budge from our place, doesn't {{want to come back to}} New York even for a visit, which I, for one, can well understand!

5|$|Despite the Italian Heavy Draft's early {{popularity}} as {{a strong}} but fast draft horse, increasing mechanization in the farming and military sectors reduced the need for all draft horses, and population numbers declined. In the 1970s, selection processes were changed {{to focus on the}} production of animals for horse meat, and that has continued to be the primary focus through the present time. In 1976, a breed association was formed in Italy to <b>preserve</b> <b>and</b> promote the Italian Heavy Draft. The association is charged with maintaining the stud book, evaluating breeding stock, granting equine passports, maintaining genetic databases, and exhibiting the breed. The main breeding areas for the Italian Heavy Draft are in the plains and hills around Verona, Padova, Vicenza, Venice, Treviso and Udine. In 2005, it was estimated that there were just under 6,500 Italian Heavy Drafts, about half of which were mares. The registered population at the end of 2010 was 6304, with the largest numbers in Lazio and Umbria; the number of unregistered Heavy Drafts is not reported.|$|E
