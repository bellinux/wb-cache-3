DE1 was assigned to the Milford Bypass and concurrently with DE 14 along the coastal highway south from Milford to the Maryland state line at Fenwick Island in 1973. DE1 was co-signed with DE14 through the Delaware beach communities until 1976, when DE14 was truncated at Milford. The DE1 designation was extended north by 1988 along US113 from Milford to Dover and continuing north along US13 toward Christiana to connect sections of the Relief Route as they were completed. In 1991, DelDOT enacted corridor <b>preservation</b> <b>measures</b> on DE 1, including its concurrency with US 113, from Dover Air Force Base to Nassau to prevent excessive development along the corridor so it can gradually be transformed into a freeway.|$|E
5|$|On local issues, Howard was an {{advocate}} of opening Richmond to gambling facilities, {{which led to the}} River Rock Casino Resort. He was supportive of heritage <b>preservation</b> <b>measures</b> but opposed Richmond's tree preservation bylaw. He was the only one on council who preferred the elevated option for the Canada Line (then known as the Richmond-Airport-Vancouver Line), whereas the other councillors preferred the ground level option or no SkyTrain extension at all. He was {{an advocate}} for building a convention centre and the most ardent supporter of removing a 55-acre piece of land from the Agricultural Land Reserve as a possible location for it, though the removal was refused. When the possibility of the city constructing a speed-skating oval associated with the 2010 Winter Olympics came, Howard was a vocal supporter. He travelled to Lillehammer, Norway, in 2004 as part of a committee to investigate similar facilities built for the 1994 Winter Olympics. He also traveled to Pierrefonds, Quebec and Asia as part of the sister city program. He was not supportive of proposals to build a new soccer facility or financially contributing to tall ships tourism attractions. Because previous councils had made funding commitments {{at the expense of the}} city's reserve funds rather than the tax base, Howard's time on council was marked with consistent property tax increases around 3 to 4% each year. Howard unsuccessfully lobbied other councillors to hire more police officers. He became the subject of a lawsuit, along with other Richmond First councillors, alleging a conflict-of-interest occurred after they approved a rezoning allowing a controversial pub.|$|E

40|$|Image Registration (IR) is {{the process}} of {{transformation}} of different data into the coordinate system and provides the geometric alignment of two images used in the computer vision, medical imaging and remote sensing applications. An image registration is an important stage in multi-temporal image processing since, the recovery of information from cloud shadow is difficult. Traditionally, the Demons, Combined Registration and Segmentation (CRS) approach, Markov Random Field (MRF) and Mutual Information (MI) based approaches offers more computational complexity, minimum edge <b>preservation</b> <b>measure</b> (QAB/F) during image registration process. To maximize the quality of edge <b>preservation</b> <b>measure</b> and MI with minimum computational time, this paper proposes hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) -Affine Transformation (AT) technique for an image registration. An enhanced registration process and the cloud removal technique are proposed for quality improvement of an image. Initially, Gaussian filtering in the preprocessing stage removes the noises present in an image. The proposed PSO extracts the matching points between the reference image and target image in the multi-temporal image dataset. Then, the AT on extracted matching points provides the specific feature points from main features. Finally, the Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) classification forms the cluster of specific feature points. The extracted feature points from PSO-AT maximize the quality of edge preservation and MI with efficient cloud removal. The comparative analysis with the traditional methods of Control Point –Least Square (CP-LS), Multi-Focus Image Fusion (MFIF) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) on the parameters of QAB/F and MI shows the effectiveness of proposed PSO-AT...|$|R

50|$|There are a {{wide variety}} of {{analogue}} photograph, tape and film formats held in the AIATSIS collection, which pose special preservation and future access risks. The age of some of these formats and materials, combined with the varying conditions in which they were stored prior to their acquisition by AIATSIS, heightens the deterioration of the media. Another preservation issue inherent in these analogue materials is the machines that can play back that particular format, as in some cases the material and the playback device are no longer manufactured. To manage these risks and maintain future access to the collection, preservation of the actual content contained in collection items is also achieved through a program of digitisation.Due to the potential issues of long-term archiving and storage of digital items, the opposite process is often employed to ensure access and preservation.
