A standard approach in designing these protocols is to base them upon existing single-server systems having the desired properties.

The experiment suggests that the total frequency of an entity in a retrieved set of documents has less to say on the entity's relevance than the number of retrieved documents it occurs in.

The hierarchy of interactions that influences stability and feedback processes can guide resource allocation for environmental monitoring, investigate alternative management strategies, and help formulate novel research hypotheses. Second, a combined graph-theoretic and probabilistic approach evaluates the potential for long-term changes in equilibrium (Chapter 3).
