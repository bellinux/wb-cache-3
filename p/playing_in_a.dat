5|$|After {{his arrival}} in 2006, Carrick formed an {{effective}} partnership with Paul Scholes, with Carrick <b>playing</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> holding role and Scholes as a deep playmaker.

His unassuming style, however, has also led to a lack of attention from successive England national football team managers in favour of all-action midfielders such as Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard, a fact noted by Carrick's club and national team captain Wayne Rooney.|$|E
