40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to give some {{comments}} on two approximations used to price rein-statements related to excess of loss reinsurance. For the pro rata capita clause, we will study the rate on line method. For the <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> <b>temporis</b> clause, we will study the use of a trivial approximation. The effect of an aggregate deductible is also looked at. KEYWORDS Excess of loss reinsurance, reinstatements, pro rata capita, <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> <b>temporis,</b> rate on line...|$|E

3000|$|The fifth {{equation}} treats principal prioritization. The equation {{requires the}} additional parameters α and β _ΔTS,M. It was constructed {{so that the}} first part of the equation is the same as the equation for the <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> case. Thus, the two additional terms in the equation for principal prioritization versus the equation for the <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> case determine whether the resulting levered equity beta is greater, less than or equal to the levered equity beta for the <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> distribution, when equal inputs are used. As was mentioned earlier, β _ΔTS,M> 0 is a reasonable assumption for principal prioritization. Furthermore, for a positive risk-free rate the term τ×D/S×([...] r^c/R^c - α×r^c - r^f/R^f) is always positive. Assuming that β _U,M>β _D,M, makes the two additional terms positive. This leads to a levered equity beta that is greater than the one under the assumption of a <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> distribution.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Currently, the <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> {{method is}} widely used to price policy {{extensions}} and other changes to policy length. However, {{there are several other}} methods that an actuary can use in pricing policy-length changes, such as option and forward pricing, or modeling. There is little discussion in the literature about the relative merits of these different methods, leaving the pricing actuary potentially unsure of which method to use in a given situation. This paper seeks to resolve some of that ambiguity by identifying the features of a contract that would indicate the need to select a certain method over others. The goal of this discussion is to provide the pricing actuary with a framework {{that can be used to}} select the most appropriate method for the particular contract that is being priced. The paper then provides simple examples of how these methods might be applied in different situations. Finally, it compares the results obtained using the recommended method to the results from the <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> method, and points out the potential for pricing insufficiencies when the <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> method is applied universally. These results should encourage the reader to consider pricing techniques aside from the standard <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> method...|$|R

40|$|Environmental {{contamination}} often causes {{injuries that}} occur {{over long periods}} of time. These “long-tail” injuries, which tend to span periods during which a liable party was covered by multiple insurers, do not map neatly onto standard indemnification insurance policies. As a result, liable parties and their insurers frequently engage in protracted litigation to minimize the portion that they must contribute to environmental remediation projects. In Boston Gas Co. v. Century Indemnity, the U. S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit upheld an application of Massachusetts’s recently announced <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> apportionment rule, which greatly reduced the insurer’s liability. Proponents of <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> apportionment argue that it lessens the burden that indemnification litigation puts on court dockets and that it promotes environmentally conscientious business practices. This Comment challenges those claims and argues that <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> apportionment may actually undermine environmental remediation projects by limiting the amount of private resources available for them...|$|R
