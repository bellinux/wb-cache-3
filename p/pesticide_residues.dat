Toxins derived from pesticides have led to fish kills; six of these events were recorded between 1964 and 1968 alone. The pesticide issue is even greater in streams and water bodies near agricultural lands irrigated by the Imperial Irrigation District with Colorado River water. In the Imperial Valley, Colorado River water used for irrigation overflows into the New and Alamo rivers and into the Salton Sea. Both rivers and the sea {{are among the most}} polluted bodies of water in the United States, posing dangers not only to aquatic life but to contact by humans and migrating birds.

Also in Australia, cattle and sheep in certain areas were often found losing their appetite and dying in the midst of rich pasture; this was at length found to be a result of cobalt deficiency in the soil. Plant toxins are also a risk to grazing animals; for instance, sodium fluoroacetate, found in some African and Australian plants, kills by disrupting the cellular metabolism. Certain man-made pollutants such as methylmercury and some <b>pesticide</b> <b>residues</b> present a particular hazard due to their tendency to bioaccumulate in meat, potentially poisoning consumers.|$|E

Many regulatory and scholarly reviews have evaluated the relative toxicity of glyphosate as an herbicide. The German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment toxicology review in 2013 found that [...] "the available data is contradictory and far from being convincing" [...] with regard to correlations between exposure to glyphosate formulations and risk of various cancers, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). A meta-analysis published in 2014 identified {{an increased risk of}} NHL in workers exposed to glyphosate formulations. In March 2015 the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer classified glyphosate as [...] "probablynbsp&carcinogenicnbsp&in humans" [...] (category 2A) based on epidemiological studies, animal studies, and in vitro studies. In November, 2015, the European Food Safety Authority published an updated assessment report on glyphosate, concluding that [...] "the substance is unlikely to be genotoxic (i.e. damaging to DNA) or to pose a carcinogenic threat to humans." [...] Furthermore, the final report clarified that while other, probably carcinogenic, glyphosate-containing formulations may exist, studies [...] "that look solely at the active substance glyphosate do not show this effect." [...] The WHO and FAO Joint committee on <b>pesticide</b> <b>residues</b> issued a report in 2016 confirming that the use of glyphosate formulations does not constitute a health risk and also gave admissible daily intake limits for chronic toxicity. The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) maintained their current classification of glyphosate as a substance causing serious eye damage and as a substance toxic to aquatic life, but did not find evidence implicating it to be a carcinogen, a mutagen, toxic to reproduction, nor toxic to specific organs.|$|E

Results show that pure carbendazim, polyethylene, and rice powder can be easily distinguished from each other. However, when the weight ratio was low, the absorbance of the mixture was similar with that of pure polyethylene and rice powder. With the help of SVM, carbendazim could be qualitatively detected in low weight ratio mixture successfully. Moreover, PLS and SVR were selected to quantitatively detect carbendazim mixtures.

The response signals of different concentrations cholorpyrifos pesticide were compared with electrochemical workstation to validate the instrument.

It is become basis of economic growth and main contributor in national economy prior to the 1970 s. However, in order to increase the food production such as vegetables and fruits, pesticides is widely used in agriculture industry to prevent, destroying or mitigating any pest that can cause harm to plant. Unfortunately, the <b>pesticide</b> <b>residue</b> level in vegetables is dangerous and can cause harm to human health if excessive consumption of pesticides in vegetables is highly taken. Commonly, people tend to wash the vegetables only by using tap water before cook or eaten raw without knowing kevel of food safety before these commodities been consumed.
