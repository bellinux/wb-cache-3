After the first prayer, he began to give lecture to worshipers who had wrote their questions on the <b>paper.</b> Meanwhile, a <b>tape</b> <b>recorder</b> accompanied with <b>papers</b> was put on the desk in front of Khamenei by a young man who pressed a button. After a minute the loud speaker’s sound become like whistle and suddenly the <b>tape</b> <b>recorder</b> exploded. [...] "A gift of Furqan Group to Islamic republic", it was written on the inner wall of the <b>tape</b> <b>recorder.</b> The treatment duration of [...] Ayatollah [...] Khamenei [...] took several month and his arm, vocal chords and lungs were seriously injured.

50|$|Because {{the output}} was an audio {{alternating}} current {{and not a}} direct current, the detector could only be used with earphones and not with the common recording instrument used in coherer radiotelegraphy receivers, the siphon <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorder.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The coherer is a {{primitive}} form of radio signal detector {{used in the}} first radio receivers during the wireless telegraphy era {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century. Its use in radio was based on the 1890 findings of French physicist Edouard Branly and adapted by other physicists and inventors over the next ten years. The device consists of a tube or capsule containing two electrodes spaced a small distance apart with loose metal filings in the space between. When a radio frequency signal is applied to the device, the metal particles would cling together or [...] "cohere", reducing the initial high resistance of the device, thereby allowing a much greater direct current to flow through it. In a receiver, the current would activate a bell, or a Morse <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorder</b> to make a record of the received signal. The metal filings in the coherer remained conductive after the signal (pulse) ended so that the coherer had to be [...] "decohered" [...] by tapping it with a clapper, such as a doorbell ringer, each time a signal was received, thereby restoring the coherer to its original state. Coherers remained in widespread use until about 1907, when they were replaced by more sensitive electrolytic and crystal detectors.|$|E
50|$|In 1932, {{after six}} years of {{developmental}} work, Merle Duston, a Detroit radio engineer, created a <b>tape</b> <b>recorder</b> that used a low-cost chemically treated <b>paper</b> <b>tape,</b> capable of recording both sounds and voice. During the recording process, the tape moved through a pair of electrodes which immediately imprinted the modulated sound signals as visible black stripes into the <b>paper</b> <b>tape's</b> surface. The sound track could be immediately replayed from the same recorder unit, which also contained photoelectric sensors, somewhat similar to the various motion picture sound-on-film technologies of the era.|$|R

The EDUC-8 also had front panel lights and switches to program the computer.

The articles were collected into a book, where additional information was published detailing how to expand the number of I/O ports to 256, adding up to 32KB of additional memory, and using the computer to control various switches.|$|R
