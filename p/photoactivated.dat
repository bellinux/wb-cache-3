30|$|The {{bleaching}} of one FP can {{be combined}} with the photoactivation of another to improve the visibility of fusion, for instance, using the combination described above of PAGFP and DsRed. Using two-photon excitation for photoactivation at ~ 750  nm effectively simultaneously bleaches DsRed and <b>photoactivates</b> PAGFP. Alternatively, high intensity from the green, DsRed excitation laser (typically 543 or 561  nm) can be used simultaneously with UV illumination to achieve the photoactivation/bleaching effect, which is illustrated in Fig.  1. This technique has helped show that transfer of matrix contents during mitochondrial fusion is un-directed, i.e. occurs by passive diffusion (Liu et al. 2009).|$|R
40|$|Silver {{nanostructures}} {{deposited on}} glass showed luminescent blinking when excited {{at a high}} 442 nm irradiance. The irradiance required to <b>photoactivate</b> the silver, was dependent {{on the nature of}} the silver nanostructures. Silver fractal-like structures were found to be highly emissive, requiring only 30 W/cm 2 for photoactivation as compared to silver island films and spin-coated silver colloids, which required a significantly higher irradiance,> 100 W/cm 2, to observe similar luminescent emission. In contrast to our recent findings for gold colloids, foci with different color blinking were also observed, with an increase in luminescence intensity as a function of time. We place these findings in context with recent work from our laboratory which employs these silver nanostructures for applications in metal-enhanced fluorescence, a relatively new phenomenon in fluorescence, whereby metallic particles, colloids, and fractal-like structures can modify the intrinsic radiative decay rate of close proximity fluorescent species. These effects are a consequence of localized changes in photonic mode density around the fluorophores, and we can now report are typically observed at significantly lower illumination intensities as compared to those required to <b>photoactivate</b> silver. Subsequently, our findings strongly suggest that the enhanced fluorescence emission of fluorophores positioned in close proximity to metallic silver structures is not due to either intrinsic silver blinking, or indeed the silver luminescence pumping the fluorophore. Further, the intrinsic luminescence properties of silver reported here, suggest a new class of luminescence probes and labels...|$|R

We have {{discovered}} several novel features exhibited by microtubules (MTs) in migrating newt lung epithelial cells by time-lapse imaging of fluorescently labeled, microinjected tubulin.

Occasionally “pioneering ” MTs grow into the lamellipodium, where microtubule bending and reorientation parallel to the leading edge is associated with retrograde flow.

40|$|The present {{palette of}} opsin-based optogenetic tools lacks a light-gated {{potassium}} (K+) channel desirable for silencing of excitable cells. Here, {{we describe the}} construction of a blue-light–induced K+ channel 1 (BLINK 1) engineered by fusing the plant LOV 2 -Jα photosensory module to the small viral K+ channel Kcv. BLINK 1 exhibits biophysical features of Kcv, including K+ selectivity and high single-channel conductance but reversibly <b>photoactivates</b> in blue light. Opening of BLINK 1 channels hyperpolarizes the cell to the K+ equilibrium potential. Ectopic expression of BLINK 1 reversibly inhibits the escape response in light-exposed zebrafish larvae.

Time-lapse microscopy allowed us to precisely characterize the kinetics of elementary steps in the signaling cascade and provided insight into adaptive feedback and rate-determining processes in the pathway. Signal transduction pathways use cascades of protein and lipid kinase mediated phosphorylation to elicit specific responses to distinct extracellular stimuli.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the <b>photoactivating</b> effect of hypericin on two cancer cell lines: PC- 3, a prostatic adenocarcinoma non-responsive to androgen therapy and LNCaP, a lymphonodal metastasis of prostate carcinoma responsive to androgen therapy.

The cells are irradiated at 599 nm (fluence = 11 J/cm 2) using a dye laser pumped by an argon laser. Hypericin exerts phototoxic effects on both cell lines, while it does not produce toxic effects {{in the absence of}} irradiation.

40|$|Purpose The poor tissue {{penetration}} of visible light {{has been a}} major barrier for optical imaging, photoactivatable conversions, and photodynamic therapy for in vivo targets with depths beyond 10 mm. In this report, as a proof-of-concept, we demonstrated that a positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer, 2 -deoxy- 2 -[[superscript 18]F]fluoro-d-glucose ([superscript 18]FDG), could be used as an alternative light source for photoactivation. Procedures We utilized [superscript 18]FDG, which is a metabolic activity-based PET probe, as a source of light to <b>photoactivate</b> caged luciferin in a breast cancer animal model expressing luciferase. Results Bioluminescence produced from luciferin allowed for the real-time monitoring of Cherenkov radiation-promoted uncaging of the substrate.

50|$|Alternatively, {{the advent}} of <b>photoactivated</b> {{localization}} microscopy could achieve similar results by relying on blinking or switching of single molecules, where the fraction of fluorescing molecules is very small at each time. This stochastic response of molecules on the applied light corresponds also to a highly nonlinear interaction, leading to subdiffraction resolution.|$|E

Exposure of the electron-beam irradiated polycaprolactone surfaces to an acrylic acid solution {{in the presence of}} Mohr’s salt led to a graft polymerisation of the acrylic acid on to the polymer surface [125]. A three-step peptide immobilisation process was then used to immobilise a cysteine-terminated RGD-containing peptides onto the grafted surface. EBL {{has also been}} exploited to locally crosslink amine-terminated poly(ethylene glycol) films to create hydrogel nanoarrays with ∼ 200 nm features on silicon substrates [126].

40|$|Both photoswitchable {{fluorescent}} nanoparticles and photoactivatable fluorescent proteins {{have been}} used for super-resolution far-field imaging on the nanometer scale, but the <b>photoactivating</b> wavelength for such photochemical events generally falls in the near-UV (NUV) region (< 420 nm), which is not preferred in cellular imaging. However, using two near-IR (NIR) photons that are lower in energy, we can circumvent such problems and replace NUV single-photon excitations (e. g., 390 nm) with NIR two-photon excitations (e. g., 780 nm). Thus, we have demonstrated that alternating 780 nm NIR two-photon and 488 nm single-photon excitations induces reversible on-off fluorescence switching of immunotargeted nanoparticles in the human breast cancer cell line SK-BR- 3. Herein, two-photon absorption not only caused spiropyran-merocyanine photoisomerization within the particles but also imparted red fluorescence. In comparison with single-photon NUV excitations, two-photon NIR laser excitations can potentially reduce absorption-related photodamage to living systems because cellular systems absorb much more weakly in the NIR. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

This simplified system replaces the complex enzymatic system of protein components A 2, A 3 a, A 3 b, and ATP, which previously represented the only available means of reactivating the enzyme. Components necessary for light activation include N-(7 -mercaptoheptanoyl) -L-threonine O 3 -phosphate (HS-HTP), CH 3 -S-CoM, titanium(III) citrate [Ti(III) Cit], and light above 400 nm.

Methanogenesis continued when the light-activated reaction mixture was incubated in the dark.

40|$|Channelrhodopsin- 2 (ChR 2) {{is widely}} used for rapid photodepolarization of neurons, yet, as it {{requires}} high-intensity blue light for activation, it is not suited for long-term in vivo applications, e. g. for manipulations of behavior, or photoactivation of neurons during development. We used "slow" ChR 2 variants with mutations in the C 128 residue, that exhibit delayed off-kinetics and increased light sensitivity in Caenorhabditis elegans. Following a 1 s light pulse, we could photodepolarize neurons and muscles for minutes (and with repeated brief stimulation, up to days) with low-intensity light. Photoactivation of ChR 2 (C 128 S) in command interneurons elicited long-lasting alterations in locomotion. Finally, we could optically induce profound changes in animal development: Long-term photoactivation of ASJ neurons, which regulate larval growth, bypassed the constitutive entry into the "dauer" larval state in daf- 11 mutants. These lack a guanylyl cyclase, which possibly renders ASJ neurons hyperpolarized. Furthermore, photostimulated ASJ neurons could acutely trigger dauer-exit. Thus, slow ChR 2 s can be employed to long-term <b>photoactivate</b> behavior and to trigger alternative animal development...|$|R

Like other family members, this Ca(2 +) -inhibited 67 -kDa protein contains two EF hands followed by two actin-binding sites of the alpha-actinin/beta-spectrin type. Dd plastin interacted selectively with actin isoforms: it bound to D. discoideum actin and to beta/gamma-actin from bovine spleen but not to alpha-actin from rabbit skeletal muscle. Immunofluorescence labeling of growth phase cells showed accumulation of Dd plastin in cortical structures associated with cell surface extensions. In the elongated, streaming cells of the early aggregation stage, Dd plastin was enriched in the front regions. To examine how the bundled actin filaments behave in myosin II-driven motility, complexes of F-actin and Dd plastin were bound to immobilized heavy meromyosin, and motility was started by <b>photoactivating</b> caged ATP.
