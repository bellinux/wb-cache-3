40|$|U- 78608, a new monocarbam antibiotic, was {{evaluated}} for in vitro activity against 312 clinical isolates of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria {{and subjected to}} several in vitro biochemical tests characterizing its interactions with beta-lactamases and penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). The antibacterial activity of the compound was compared directly with those of SQ 83, 360 (<b>pirazmonam)</b> and aztreonam. U- 78608, SQ 83, 360, and aztreonam had generally poor activity against gram-positive aerobic bacteria and anaerobic bacteria. U- 78608 demonstrated activity primarily against gram-negative aerobic bacteria, with potency generally {{comparable to that of}} SQ 83, 360. U- 78608 and SQ 83, 360 were less active than aztreonam for some gram-negative species; however, both compounds were 8 - to 64 -fold more active than aztreonam against Acinetobacter species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Pseudomonas maltophilia. All three compounds resisted inactivation by several different beta-lactamases from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Neither U- 78608 nor SQ 83, 360 exhibited significant inhibition of these enzymes, while aztreonam inhibited beta-lactamases from P. aeurginosa and Klebsiella oxytoca. All three compounds exhibited strong affinity to PBP 3 of Escherichia coli and moderate to negligible affinity to the other E. coli PBPs; quantitative measurements indicated that U- 78608 had greater PBP 3 affinity than either SQ 83, 360 or aztreonam...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{beta-lactam}} agents containing iron-chelating moieties, such as E 0702, {{which contains}} catechol, and <b>pirazmonam</b> and U- 78, 608, which contain 3 -hydroxypyridone, have been developed. By determining the susceptibility to these agents of Escherichia coli mutants lacking various iron-repressible outer membrane proteins, {{we showed that}} two of these proteins with hitherto unknown functions, Fiu and Cir, were apparently involved in the transport of monomeric catechol and its analogs. These results confirm the conclusion of Curtis and co-workers, which was obtained by using {{a different set of}} catechol-containing antibiotics (N. A. C. Curtis, R. L. Eisenstadt, S. J. East, R. J. Cornford, L. A. Walker, and A. J. White, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 32 : 1879 - 1886, 1988). E 0702 was shown to enhance the uptake of radioactive ferric iron into wild-type cells but not into cir fiu double mutants. By combining the influx of E 0702 with its hydrolysis by a periplasmic beta-lactamase, we showed that the wild-type cells transported unliganded E 0702 at a rate comparable to or even higher than the rate of transport of the E 0702 -Fe 3 + complex. We postulate that the main function of Cir and Fiu may be to recapture the hydrolytic products of enterobactin, such as 2, 3 -dihydroxybenzoic acid and 2, 3 -dihydroxybenzoylserine...|$|E
