In waveform tomography, an initial model is required which predicts the first arrival traveltimes to within a half-cycle of the lowest frequency in the data. Because seismic velocity anisotropy can be significant, the initial model must quantify the anisotropy, as well as the velocity, {{in order to meet the}} half-cycle criterion. In our case study, difficulties were encountered in generating an accurate anisotropy model through traveltime tomography, and the starting model for waveform tomography failed the half-cycle criterion.

40|$|Carbon and {{nitrogen}} isotope ratios were measured for various ecogeochemical samples relevant to bat guano ecosystems. In particular, ca. 800 -year-old subfossil guano from Jackson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Bay</b> Cave Compex, Jamaica, yielded ratios {{similar to the}} modern guano from other Jamaican bat caves but quite different from modern guano of the same area. Diagenetic change and differences in bat food habits were unlikely explanations for the observation. Instead, insects that feed on C 4 and CAM plants were the main prey for the bats in present Jackson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Bay</b> area, while the ultimate source of organic matter for bats in other Jamaican caves and for the bats that deposited guano in Jackson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Bay</b> Great Cave ca. 800 years ago were C 3 photosynthesis. We suggest that the isotopic data indicate that the surrounding environment experienced a significant mesic episode in the recent past. This mesic climate would have supported a large population of bats, which in turn would have accumulated significant quantities of guano. The subsequent return to the more xeric conditions prevailing today would have caused a drastic reduction in bat population size and effectively ended significant guano accumulation. Fossil guano from Carlsbad Caverns, New Mexico, U. S. A., suggested that native C 3 plants {{might have been more}} abundant in Wisconsinan than today. Isotope analyses of old guanos from Bat Cave in Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona, U. S.

40|$|Transportation was a prime {{consideration}} in the business policies of the Hudson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Bay</b> Company from its inception. Although the company legally enjoyed the position of monopoly {{by virtue of the}} Royal Charter of 1670, which granted to the Hudson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Bay</b> Company the Canadian territory called Rupert 2 ̆ 7 s Land, this privilege had to be defended from commercial intruders. From the earliest days the company developed its own transportation network in order to maintain a competitive edge over its opponents. During its first century, when business ventured hardly beyond the shores of the Hudson Bay, the company perfected its transatlantic shipping. Later, when competitors from Montreal moved into the western interior, the Hudson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Bay</b> Company countered by opening several inland rivers, developing a unique wooden craft, the Yorkboat, and constructing rollered passage ways around several rapids. The efficiency of its transportation system enabled the company to defeat all challengers, including the Montreal traders, who were absorbed in 1821. Starving the competition by slashing prices, trading liquor, and deploying its best servants to critical areas were other tactics the company employed to preserve its fur empire. The principal means by which the Hudson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Bay</b> Company defended its trade monopoly, nevertheless, was to maintain an efficient transportation system into Rupert 2 ̆ 7 s Land. By the 1850 s the company 2 ̆ 7 s policy of controlling access to its fur preserve faced an entirely new and potentially fatal challenge. Settlement, with technology based on an expanding agricultural-industrial economy, was rapidly approaching the undeveloped plains. The economic activities of this encroaching civilization foretold death for the fur trade. Several fur empires in other parts of North America had already yielded to the relentless advance of settlement; company officials knew that theirs would also eventually succumb. As early as 1849 Peter Skene Ogden, the chief factor in Oregon, wrote George Simpson, the resident governor of the Hudson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Bay</b> Company, 2 ̆ 2 You are I presume fully aware that the fur trade and civilization can never blend together and experience teaches us that the former invariably gives way to the latter. 2 ̆ 2 Understanding that the fall of the fertile portion of Rupert 2 ̆ 7 s Land to agricultural settlement was inevitable, the Hudson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Bay</b> Company developed a strategy to retain its hold over the fur trade wherever possible and to dominate the commercial potential of the new economic order. Accessibility was the key to the survival plan; realizing that transportation was the vanguard of the new civilization, the company once again decided to control this technology within its domain and to develop it to the company 2 ̆ 7 s own advantage. The most obvious legal threat to the company 2 ̆ 7 s charter came from the province of Canada. This British colony could claim historical, imperial, and juridical ties with Rupert 2 ̆ 7 s Land. During the 1850 s, however, the provincial government did not press claims to the territories. The editor of the Toronto Globe, George Brown, tried to rally his readers to the cause of western annexation-for years his strident editorials praised the Northwest as a panacea for the stagnating economy of Upper Canada-but his proposal remained a minor issue even in his own Clear Grit party and was dismissed as unimportant by the Montreal press. In 1857 a legislative committee, established to investigate the worrisome emigration of young Canadians to the United States, completely ignored the prairies as a haven for prospective farmers and urged instead that they be retained in Canada by means of a vigorous industrialization policy. That same year Canada 2 ̆ 7 s position at the British parliamentary inquiry into the Hudson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Bay</b> Company license was timid and noncommittal. Canada simply could not afford to buyout the company 2 ̆ 7 s charter and trading rights nor could it finance the administration of such a vast domain...|$|R

40|$|By royal charter, Charles II in 1670 {{granted to}} a small coterie of London entrepreneurs, united in a joint stock company, {{exclusive}} trading privileges in a vast territory of then unknown dimensions. The group was the 2 ̆ 2 Company of Adventurers of England trading into Hudson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Bay,</b> 2 ̆ 2 the Hudson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Bay</b> Company. The territory was Rupert 2 ̆ 7 s Land, named for Prince Rupert, cousin of the monarch, who graciously consented to act as the first governor of the company. By charter, Rupert 2 ̆ 7 s Land included 2 ̆ 2 all the Landes Countryes and Territoryes upon the Coastes and Confynes of the Seas 2 ̆ 2 lying within Hudson Strait, that is, the area drained by waters flowing into Hudson and James bays and Hudson Strait. The new enterprise erected trading factories at the mouths {{of several of the}} large rivers, Rupert, Moose, Albany, and Nelson-Hayes, and established a trading system based on the annual journeying of Indian customers to these export posts. The executive committee of Hudson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Bay</b> Company urged employees to accompany Indian groups inland from the factories at the bay shore to winter among the tribes and to encourage them at river break-up time to return to the factories with their furs and other trade items. Not only would this policy allow the company winterers to recruit customers, but it would also develop a cadre of experienced travelers. For many years, no one accepted this challenge, except for Henry Kelsey-a young scamp to some, a young hero to others-who undertook a lone journey onto the Saskatchewan plains between 1690 and 1692. Kelsey, who eventually became a senior trader in the company, operating mainly out of the York and Churchill factories, was certainly the company 2 ̆ 7 s first winterer and the first European to journey onto the northern plains of North America. Regrettably, he did not draw a map depicting his route or the extent of his penetration of the plains. Therefore, there is no cartographic memorial to the commencement of the Hudson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Bay</b> Company 2 ̆ 7 s long involvement with the Canadian western interior. After Kelsey 2 ̆ 7 s voyage, the vast region was not intruded upon again by British traders for over sixty years. For some thirty years, the company was deeply embroiled in defending the Hudson and James Bay littoral against incursion by the French, whose forces occupied several of the chief Hudson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Bay</b> Company factories during Anglo-French wars. The company 2 ̆ 7 s explorers struggled to extend their knowledge of the northwest shore of Hudson Bay, investigating inlets for a possible opening to a Northwest Passage. Success in this venture could give the company great advantage in the extension of trade. Forays onto the plains by wintering company employees were not resumed until 1754, when Anthony Henday reached nearly to the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. Perennial occupation of the Great Plains, with the erection of trading houses and the posting of complements of officers and servants, was not initiated until 1774...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – Sir George Simpson, the Governor of the Hudson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Bay</b> Company (HBC) from 1821 to {{his death}} in 1860, {{was the subject of}} {{numerous}} biographical works that described various facets of the man including his managerial abilities, literary prowess, physical stamina, abundant energy, extensive art collection and ethnological specimens. Two related aspects of his outstanding management style have been overlooked: the genesis of his management style and where it can be placed in the evolution of management practices during the 19 th century. Design/methodology/approach – Primary data from the Hudson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Bay</b> Company archives plus secondary sources. Findings – Simpson 2 ̆ 7 s management abilities came from his grammar school education and his apprenticeship to a counting house. More importantly, it can be attributed to his association with his mentor Andrew Wedderburn, his dedication to the HBC, and his high level of physical and intellectual energy. His information intensive management style was also a significant precursor to systematic management, which occurred later in the 19 th century. Research limitations/implications – Future research should examine other examples of the evolution of management during the 19 th century, particularly the transition from sub-unit accountability to systematic management.
