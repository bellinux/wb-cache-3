5|$|In 2004, the University of Chicago claimed 133,155 living alumni.

5|$|Gandhi's London {{lifestyle}} {{incorporated the}} values {{he has grown}} up with. When he returned to India in 1891, his outlook was parochial {{and he could not}} make a living as a lawyer. This challenged his belief that <b>practicality</b> and morality necessarily coincided. By moving in 1893 to South Africa he found a solution to this problem and developed the central concepts of his mature philosophy.|$|E

5|$|Lord Wraxall's widow, Ursula, Lady Wraxall, {{was left}} with two {{children}} under two years of age, little income, and a large estate. Noted for her efficiency and <b>practicality,</b> when the clock tower, {{the focal point of}} the house, needed substantial repairs in 1935 to overcome dry and wet rot, she simply had it disassembled, stored the metal parts for possible later usage and realigned the roof as if the clock tower had never existed.|$|E
5|$|Media {{reports said}} the attack struck {{at the heart}} of American covert {{operations}} in the region, with some characterizing it as the CIA's Pearl Harbor.

5|$|Recognizing the <b>practicality</b> of this solution, Admiral Rodman {{requested}} that the Navy Department send another battleship to operate with his division. Specifically, Rodman requested the ship be New Yorks sister ship , to better match Grand Fleet policy, which encouraged the use of matched pairs to aid in rangefinding. Although there was some grumbling at the Navy Department that a five ship division was counter to U.S. Navy policy, they eventually agreed, and on 11 February 1918, Texas arrived at Scapa Flow.|$|E

5|$|The book {{is noted}} for its <b>practicality,</b> departing from earlier {{practice}} in avoiding plagiarism, consisting instead almost entirely of direct instructions based on Raffald's experience.

5|$|After the Second World War, Moore's bronzes took {{on their}} larger scale, which was {{particularly}} suited for public art commissions. As {{a matter of}} <b>practicality,</b> he largely abandoned direct carving, and took on several assistants to help produce the larger forms based on maquettes. By {{the end of the}} 1940s, he produced sculptures increasingly by modelling, working out the shape in clay or plaster before casting the final work in bronze using the lost wax technique. These maquettes often began as small forms shaped by Moore's hands—a process which gives his work an organic feeling. They are from the body.|$|E
5|$|Before its takeover, the DR {{had carried}} out some joint {{electrification}} experiments with the Metropolitan Railway (MR), the other sub-surface line {{with which the}} DR shared the Inner Circle. A section of track between Earl's Court and High Street Kensington was electrified with a four-rail system and a jointly owned test train operated a shuttle service between February and November 1900. Having proven the <b>practicality</b> of electric traction, the two companies set up a joint committee to select a supplier of equipment for the electrification of their networks.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the advent}} of iron {{reinforced}} plows and other improved methods of crop cultivation, the regional environmental conditions placed limits on the <b>practicality</b> and extend of land tillage, but various grains, beans and peas were grown. The dense forest coverage {{on the other hand}} facilitated gathering and was more amenable to the raising of farm animals, which involved all of the major species, including in particular the small, forest type horses. The horses constituted an important element of the Baltic tribes' culture – men of the upper socioeconomic status were often buried with their horses and even together with their fancy horsemanship gear.|$|E
5|$|In April 1941, the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) asked Arthur Compton, a Nobel-Prize-winning physics {{professor}} at the University of Chicago, {{to report on the}} uranium program. His report, submitted in May 1941, foresaw the prospects of developing radiological weapons, nuclear propulsion for ships, and nuclear weapons using uranium-235 or the recently discovered plutonium. In October he wrote another report on the <b>practicality</b> of an atomic bomb. Niels Bohr and John Wheeler had theorized that heavy isotopes with odd atomic numbers were fissile. If so, then plutonium-239 was likely to be.|$|E

He also discussed the prospects for uranium enrichment with Harold Urey.|$|E

5|$|The Patent Cable Tramway Corporation {{owned the}} rights to the Hallidie {{cable-car}} system first invented and used in San Francisco in 1873; trains were attached to the cable with clamps, which would be opened and closed at stations, allowing the carriages to disconnect and reconnect without needing to stop the cable or to interfere with other trains sharing the cable. There were to be two independent endless cables, one between City station and Elephant and Castle moving at 10mph, and the other between Elephant and Castle and Stockwell, where the gradient was less, at 12mph. However, the additional length of tunnel permitted by the supplementary acts challenged the <b>practicality</b> of the cable system.|$|E
5|$|The <b>practicality</b> of this {{approach}} is questionable with modern material science, but cannot yet be ruled out. A 100% reflective statite deployed around the Sun would have an overall density of 0.78 grams per square meter of sail. To illustrate the low mass of the required materials, consider that the total mass of a bubble of such material 1 AU in radius would be about 2.17 kg, which is about the same mass as the asteroid Pallas. Another illustration: Regular printing paper has a density of around 80 g/m2.|$|E
5|$|The {{project began}} with two aims: {{to prove the}} <b>practicality</b> of the Williams tube, an early form of {{computer}} memory based on standard cathode ray tubes (CRTs); and to construct a machine {{that could be used}} to investigate how computers might be able to assist in the solution of mathematical problems. The first of the series, the Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM), ran its first program on 21 June 1948. As the world's first stored-program computer, the SSEM, and the Manchester Mark 1 developed from it, quickly attracted the attention of the United Kingdom government, who contracted the electrical engineering firm of Ferranti to produce a commercial version. The resulting machine, the Ferranti Mark 1, was the world's first commercially available general-purpose computer.|$|E

5|$|When Stone lectured in {{the dress}} {{in the fall}} of 1851, hers was the first Bloomer most of her audiences had ever seen. But by then, the dress had become controversial. Although {{newspapers}} had initially praised the <b>practicality</b> of the new style, they soon turned to ridicule and condemnation, now viewing the trousers as a usurpation of the symbol of male authority. Many women retreated in the face of criticism, but Stone continued to wear the short dress exclusively for the next three years. She also wore her hair short, cut just below her jaw line. After Stone lectured in New York City in April, 1853, the report of her speeches in the Illustrated News was accompanied by this engraving of Stone in the Bloomer dress.|$|E

In the course of three degrees, new masons will promise to keep the secrets of their degree from lower degrees and outsiders, and to support a fellow Mason in distress (as far as <b>practicality</b> and the law permit). There is instruction as to the duties of a Freemason, but on the whole, Freemasons are left to explore the craft in the manner they find most satisfying. Some will further explore the ritual and symbolism of the craft, others will focus their involvement on the social side of the Lodge, while still others will concentrate on the charitable functions of the lodge.|$|E
5|$|Focusing on the {{cultural}} and political use of the architecture at Framlingham, historian D. Plowman has put forward a revisionist interpretation of the castle's architecture in the late medieval period. Plowman suggests that the castle {{was intended to be}} entered from {{the north end of the}} Lower Court, passing through the ornamental gardens, with travellers then entering through the gate by the Prison Tower – in this interpretation, more of a barbican than a tower – and then up into the Inner Court. This would have provided high status visitors with dramatic views of the castle, reinforcing the political prestige of the owners. Historian Magnus Alexander disputes the <b>practicality</b> of this arrangement, although agrees that the route would have been more practical for hunting parties proceeding to the local parklands.|$|E
