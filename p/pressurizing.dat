5|$|Liquid helium {{is used in}} {{cryogenics}} (its {{largest single}} use, absorbing {{about a quarter of}} production), particularly in the cooling of superconducting magnets, with the main commercial application being in MRI scanners. Helium's other industrial uses—as a <b>pressurizing</b> and purge gas, as a protective atmosphere for arc welding and in processes such as growing crystals to make silicon wafers—account for half of the gas produced. A well-known but minor use is as a lifting gas in balloons and airships. As with any gas whose density differs from that of air, inhaling a small volume of helium temporarily changes the timbre and quality of the human voice. In scientific research, the behavior of the two fluid phases of helium-4 (heliumI and heliumII) is important to researchers studying quantum mechanics (in particular the property of superfluidity) and to those looking at the phenomena, such as superconductivity, produced in matter near absolute zero.|$|E
5|$|While {{balloons}} {{are perhaps}} the best known use of helium, they are a minor part of all helium use. Helium is used for many purposes that require some of its unique properties, such as its low boiling point, low density, low solubility, high thermal conductivity, or inertness. Of the 2014 world helium total production of about 32 million kg (180 million standard cubic meters) helium per year, the largest use (about 32% of the total in 2014) is in cryogenic applications, most of which involves cooling the superconducting magnets in medical MRI scanners and NMR spectrometers. Other major uses were <b>pressurizing</b> and purging systems, welding, maintenance of controlled atmospheres, and leak detection. Other uses by category were relatively minor fractions.|$|E

40|$|Several chiral drugs, promethazine, carteolol, celiprolol, and albuterol, were {{resolved}} with vancomycin as the chiral {{stationary phase}} by <b>pressurized</b> capillary electrochromatography (<b>pressurized</b> CEC) and capillary HPLC. The effects of pressure and electrical field strength on efficiency, resolution, and capacity factor in <b>pressurized</b> CEC were investigated. A mathematical model describing {{the relationship of}} capacity factor in <b>pressurized</b> CEC with voltage, <b>pressurized</b> flow velocity, electroosmotic mobility, and electrophoretic mobility was established, which was in good agreement with the experimental data...|$|R

25|$|The crew enjoyed, for {{the first}} time in a bomber, full-pressurization comfort. This first-ever cabin {{pressure}} system for an Allied production bomber was developed for the B-29 by Garrett AiResearch. The nose and the cockpit were <b>pressurized,</b> but the designers were faced with deciding whether to have bomb bays that were not <b>pressurized,</b> between fore and aft <b>pressurized</b> sections, or a fully <b>pressurized</b> fuselage with the need to de-pressurize to drop their loads. The solution was a long tunnel over the two bomb bays so as not to interrupt pressurization during bombing. Crews could crawl back and forth between the fore and aft sections, with both areas and the tunnel <b>pressurized.</b> The bomb bays were not <b>pressurized.</b>|$|R

25|$|The ALF 502 has {{experienced}} multiple issues. Its internal electronics could overheat, triggering an automatic shutdown of an engine with no option for inflight restart, and certain rare atmospheric conditions {{could cause a}} loss of engine thrust due to internal icing. Additionally, the BAe 146 experienced some issues with its bleed air and cabin pressurization systems, leading {{to a number of}} fume events where irritant fumes were introduced into the cabin via the <b>pressurizing</b> system.|$|E
25|$|Alternatively the acid-catalyzed disproportioning {{of white}} {{phosphorus}} yields phosphoric acid and phosphine. Both routes have industrial significance; the acid route is preferred method if further {{reaction of the}} phosphine to substituted phosphines is needed. The acid route requires purification and <b>pressurizing.</b> It can also be made (as described above) by the hydrolysis of a metal phosphide, such as aluminium phosphide or calcium phosphide. Pure samples of phosphine, free from P2H4, may be prepared using the action of potassium hydroxide on phosphonium iodide (PH4I).|$|E
25|$|In {{conventional}} light-water reactor (LWR) designs, {{the entire}} fissile core {{is placed in}} a large pressure vessel. The amount of heat that can be removed by a unit of a coolant {{is a function of}} the temperature; by <b>pressurizing</b> the core the water can be heated to much greater temperatures before boiling, thereby removing more heat and allowing the core to be smaller and more efficient. Building a pressure vessel of the required size is a challenge. At the time of CANDU's design, Canada lacked the heavy industry to cast and machine the pressure vessels of this size.|$|E
50|$|The Mooney Aircraft Company had {{previously}} produced a single-engine <b>pressurized</b> aircraft in 1964 (the M22 Mustang), {{which had been}} a financial disaster and was probably the largest single factor in the company's 1969 bankruptcy (although the Mustang continued to be produced through 1970).

25|$|In {{the second}} leg, the exact {{opposite}} occurred, with Barcelona constantly <b>pressurizing</b> Lyon in the first half, leaving Barcelona to control the match {{with most of the}} possession occurring in Barça's attack. This showed as Barcelona earned first half goals from Henry twice, Lionel Messi and Samuel Eto'o, which effectively ended Lyon's chances of advancing to the quarter-finals, despite Jean Makoun and Juninho scoring back-to-back goals in the 44th and 48th minutes respectively. The final scoreline eventually was 2–5, eliminating Lyon from the Champion's League for the seventh consecutive season and for the third consecutive season in the Round of 16.|$|E

The rear suspension of the W124 features the Mercedes multi-link axle introduced in 1982 with the Mercedes 190 and which is now standard on many modern cars. Estate cars (and optionally, saloons and coupés) had Citroen-like rear self-leveling suspension with suspension struts rather than shock absorbers, gas-filled suspension spheres to provide damping and an under bonnet <b>pressurizing</b> pump. Unlike the traditional Citroën application Mercedes opted for a fixed ride height and employed rear coil springs to maintain the static ride height when parked.|$|E
25|$|Alternatively, higher {{volumetric}} {{energy density}} liquid hydrogen or slush hydrogen may be used. However, liquid hydrogen is cryogenic and boils at 20.268K (–252.882°C or –423.188°F). Cryogenic storage cuts weight but requires large liquification energies. The liquefaction process, involving <b>pressurizing</b> and cooling steps, is energy intensive. The liquefied hydrogen has lower energy density by volume than gasoline by approximately {{a factor of}} four, because of the low density of liquid hydrogen — there is actually more hydrogen in a liter of gasoline (116grams) than there is in a liter of pure liquid hydrogen (71grams). Liquid hydrogen storage tanks must also be well insulated to minimize boil off. Ice may form around the tank and help corrode it further if the liquid hydrogen tank insulation fails.|$|E
40|$|<b>Pressurized</b> {{ventilation}} acts {{to increase}} the oxygen supply to roots and rhizomes in some species of emergent plants. In a greenhouse experiment, we investigated how <b>pressurized</b> ventilation affected growth, biomass allocation and mineral content of Phragmites australis in two water depths (15 cm or 75 cm) and two substrates (organic sediment or sand). Through perforating each stem above the water surface, <b>pressurized</b> ventilation was inhibited without affecting oxygen diffusion. In controls, 10 - 20 % of the stems were perforated {{to make certain that}} lack of efflux sites would not limit <b>pressurized</b> ventilation. Plants with inhibited <b>pressurized</b> ventilation had lower oxygen concentrations in their stem bases than control plants. Growth was lower in plants with inhibited <b>pressurized</b> ventilation compared to controls except when plants grew in a combination of sand and shallow water. In plants grown in an organic sediment, but not in those grown in sand, inhibition of <b>pressurized</b> ventilation resulted in decreased biomass allocation to soil roots but increased allocation to aquatic roots. Stem perforation affected the tissue concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus, magnesium, manganese and aluminium but not of calcium or iron. We suggest that the lower growth in plants with inhibited <b>pressurized</b> ventilation was caused by decreased mineral uptake, which may have resulted from the decreased proportional allocation to soil root weight, from decreased mineral availability or from impaired root function. In plants grown in sand in shallow water, diffusion seemed to cover the oxygen demand, as <b>pressurized</b> ventilation did not affect growth...|$|R
40|$|AbstractChinese fire {{prevention}} codes provided that <b>pressurized</b> ventilation {{system should be}} used in the staircase which can not exhaust fire smoke naturally. However, the codes only specified the specific parts of <b>pressurized</b> ventilation and ventilation volume, while they did not specify how to make the <b>pressurized</b> ventilation effective in particular cases. As a result, in engineering application, some staircase <b>pressurized</b> ventilation systems can not effectively prevent smoke entering the staircase. For instance, in a staircase where the <b>pressurized</b> ventilation system must be used according to the codes, opened windows were set in the wall of the staircase so as to facilitate lighting and ventilation. Although that conforms to the codes, the effect of preventing smoke invasion is still unknown. This simulation study focused on the influence of opened windows on the <b>pressurized</b> ventilation system. It was found that if there were no open windows in the staircase, the system worked. At the same time, smoke would flow into the staircase in a short time and the high temperature was fatal to the evacuees if there were opened windows on the wall of this space. These results indicated that opened windows in the staircase would lead to uselessness of the <b>pressurized</b> ventilation system. In conclusion, it was suggested there are no windows in the staircase in which a <b>pressurized</b> ventilation system should be used. And if windows are necessary in the <b>pressurized</b> staircase for light, the windows should be fixed casement windows...|$|R

25|$|Modern designs {{have also}} shifted more towards using steel {{containment}} structures. In some cases steel {{is used to}} line {{the inside of the}} concrete, which contributes strength from both materials in the hypothetical case that containment becomes highly pressurized. Yet other newer designs call for both a steel and concrete containment - which is in decades long use in the current German PWR-designs - notably the AP1000 and the European Pressurized Reactor plan to use both; which gives missile protection by the outer concrete and <b>pressurizing</b> ability by the inner steel structure. The AP1000 has planned vents {{at the bottom of the}} concrete structure surrounding the steel structure under the logic that it would help move air over the steel structure and cool containment in the event of a major accident (in a similar way to how a cooling tower works).|$|E
25|$|Early {{engine coolant}} {{antifreeze}} was methanol (methyl alcohol). Methanol was {{widely used in}} windshield fluids, however, in Europe, due to new REACH legislation, the use of methanol in windshield fluids is limited to 5% and {{in the near future}} will be further reduced to 3%. As radiator caps were vented, not sealed, the methanol was lost to evaporation, requiring frequent replenishment to avoid freezing of the coolant. Methanol also accelerates corrosion of the metals, especially aluminum, used in the engine and cooling systems. Ethylene glycol was developed, and soon replaced methanol as an engine cooling system antifreeze. It has a very low volatility compared to methanol and to water. Before the 1950s, coolant systems were unpressurized and the engine was often cooler than modern automotive engines. By <b>pressurizing</b> the coolant system with a radiator cap, the boiling point of the fluid is increased, permitting higher engine temperatures and better fuel efficiency. Pressurized systems do not appreciably change the freezing point. Later propylene glycol was introduced due to its environmental credentials.|$|E
25|$|The last {{problem to}} be solved was how to {{separate}} the Lunar Module a safe distance away from the Command Module just before re-entry. The normal procedure was to use the Service Module's reaction control system (RCS) to pull the CSM away after releasing the LM along with the Command Module's docking ring, but this RCS was inoperative because of the power failure, and the useless SM would be released before the LM. To solve the problem, Grumman called on the engineering expertise of the University of Toronto. A team of six UT engineers, led by senior scientist Bernard Etkin, was formed {{to solve the problem}} within a day. The team concluded that <b>pressurizing</b> the tunnel connecting the Lunar Module to the Command Module just before separation would provide the force necessary to push the two modules a safe distance away from each other just prior to re-entry. The team had 6 hours to compute the pressure required, using slide rules. They needed an accurate calculation, as too high a pressure might damage the hatch and its seal, causing the astronauts to burn up; too low a pressure would not provide enough separation distance of the LM. Grumman relayed their calculation to NASA, and from there in turn to the astronauts, who used it successfully.|$|E

After exiting Orion, the pair drove the lunar rover [...] away from the LM before adjusting their heading to travel [...] to North Ray Crater. The drive was smoother than that of the previous day, as the craters were shallower and boulders were less abundant north of the immediate landing site. After passing Palmetto crater, boulders gradually became larger and more abundant as they approached North Ray in the lunar rover. Upon arriving at the rim of North Ray crater, they were [...] away from the LM. After their arrival, the duo took photographs of the [...] wide and [...] deep crater. They visited a large boulder, taller than a four-story building, which became known as 'House Rock'. Samples obtained from this boulder delivered the final blow to the pre-mission volcanic hypothesis, proving it incorrect. House Rock had numerous bullet hole-like marks where micrometeoroids from space had impacted the rock. About 1 hour and 22 minutes after arriving, they departed for station 13, a large boulder field about [...] from North Ray.
