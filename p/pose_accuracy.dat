50|$|The {{international}} standard ISO 9283 sets different performance criteria for industrial robots and suggests test procedures {{in order to}} obtain appropriate parameter values. The most important criteria, and also the most commonly used, are <b>pose</b> <b>accuracy</b> (AP) and pose repeatability (RP). Repeatability is particularly important when the robot is moved towards the command positions manually ("Teach-In"). If the robot program is generated by a 3D simulation (off-line programming), absolute accuracy is vital, too. Both are generally influenced in a negative way by kinematic factors. Here especially the joint offsets and deviations in lengths and angles between the individual robot links take effect.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – This paper {{presents}} {{an effective and}} robust model-based 3 D object recognition algorithm using line feature correspondences. The algorithm identifies an object and estimates the pose of the object and provides the object recognition information to a home service robot system. The identification of the object and estimation of the poses is done by a three-stage processing: In the first stage, a list of corresponding image line sets that share same properties of mode line sets is generated. In the second stage, the correspondences in the list are evaluated and ranked. Only {{a small number of}} correspondences from the list are selected. Each correspondence contributes a pose hypothesis consisting of a similarity transformation. In the last stage, the approximate model pose hypotheses are estimated based on the selected correspondences.

40|$|Perception of head pose {{is useful}} for many face-related tasks such as face recognition, gaze estimation, and emotion analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel random forest based method for {{estimating}} head pose angles from single face images. In order to improve {{the effectiveness of the}} constructed head pose predictor, we introduce feature weighting and tree screening into the random forest training process. In this way, the features with more discriminative power {{are more likely to be}} chosen for constructing trees, and each of the trees in the obtained random forest usually has high <b>pose</b> estimation <b>accuracy,</b> while the diversity or generalization ability of the forest is not deteriorated. The proposed method has been evaluated on four public databases as well as a surveillance dataset collected by ourselves. The results show that the proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art <b>pose</b> estimation <b>accuracy.</b> Moreover, we investigate the impact of pose angle sampling intervals and heterogeneous face images on the effectiveness of trained head pose predictors...|$|R

40|$|An {{improvement}} {{method for}} the <b>pose</b> <b>accuracy</b> of a robot manipulator {{by using a}} multiple-sensor combination measuring system (MCMS) is presented. It is composed of a visual sensor, an angle sensor and a series robot. The visual sensor is utilized to measure {{the position of the}} manipulator in real time, and the angle sensor is rigidly attached to the manipulator to obtain its orientation. Due to the higher accuracy of the multi-sensor, two efficient data fusion approaches, the Kalman filter (KF) and multi-sensor optimal information fusion algorithm (MOIFA), are used to fuse the position and orientation of the manipulator. The simulation and experimental results show that the <b>pose</b> <b>accuracy</b> of the robot manipulator is improved dramatically by 38 %~ 78 % with the multi-sensor data fusion. Comparing with reported <b>pose</b> <b>accuracy</b> improvement methods, the primary advantage of this method {{is that it does not}} require the complex solution of the kinematics parameter equations, increase of the motion constraints and the complicated procedures of the traditional vision-based methods. It makes the robot processing more autonomous and accurate. To improve the reliability and accuracy of the pose measurements of MCMS, the visual sensor repeatability is experimentally studied.
