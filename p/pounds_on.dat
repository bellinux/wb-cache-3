5|$|The sport enjoyed an {{unprecedented}} surge in popularity during the Regency period {{when it was}} openly patronised by the Prince Regent (later George IV) and his brothers. Championship boxing matches acquired a louche reputation as the places {{to be seen by}} the wealthy upper classes. Thus a match would often be attended by thousands of people, many of whom had wagered money on the outcome. The Duke of Cumberland (an uncle of King George III) was reported to have bet thousands of <b>pounds</b> <b>on</b> Jack Broughton, who was the English champion for 18years.|$|E
5|$|By 1175, Henry was a royal {{official}} {{in charge of}} purchasing cloth and other items for the royal household. He also was given custody of two estates that had escheated to the crown– Rayleigh in 1181 and Boulogne in 1183. Henry often acted as a purchaser for the king, for example in 1188 Cornhill spent 290 <b>pounds</b> <b>on</b> gold, jewels, furs, and cloth for the king. Henry {{was present at the}} deathbed of Henry II in 1189. The new king, Richard I, kept Henry close and put him in charge of assembling the fleet that Richard needed to go on the Third Crusade. His accounts for his efforts in 1190 in assembling the fleet still survive. These show that Henry bought part or all of 40 ships and paid out a year's wages for over a thousand sailors for the expedition. The total expenses for Henry's efforts totalled over 5,000 pounds.|$|E
5|$|In 1102 Robert de Bellême {{rebelled against}} King Henry I of England. Although Pantulf was still {{deprived}} {{of his previous}} holdings, he offered to support Robert, but was rebuffed and instead supported the king. Henry placed Stafford Castle in Pantulf's custody. Besides controlling Stafford Castle, Pantulf mediated between Henry {{and some of the}} Welsh princes, who had previously sided with Robert, and helped secure their support for the king. Later Pantulf again acted as an envoy for the king, being sent to secure the switch of sides of Robert's men who were holding Bridgnorth. Pantulf won their change of sides by offering the men lands worth a 100 <b>pounds</b> <b>on</b> the king's behalf. His services to the king earned Pantulf the restoration of his confiscated estates as well as the grant of further lands—including the fief of Roger de Courcelles.|$|E

5|$|In Autumn La Fleche {{attempted}} {{to win a}} second Manchester Plate, but finished third to the three-year-colts Raeburn, and Isinglass. The race had been expected to lie between La Fleche and Isinglass, and their respective jockeys focused their attentions on each other, allowing Raeburn to emerge almost unseen to take the race in the closing stages. For this race, La Fleche carried a weight of 154 <b>pounds.</b> <b>On</b> 25 October she found a weight of 133 pound too much when finishing unplaced in the Cambridgeshire. She won the Lowther Stakes at Newmarket in October. On 10 November she ran in the Liverpool Autumn Cup, carrying a weight of 132 pounds and won in impressive style by one and a quarter lengths from The Prisoner. Later in November, she was beaten under 137 pounds in the Manchester November Handicap.|$|E
5|$|In October 1936, rebel {{operations}} temporarily ceased {{after the}} Arab Higher Committee (AHC), the revolt's political leadership, accepted calls by the generally pro-British royals of Jordan, Iraq and Saudi Arabia for a cessation of hostilities. In return, the Arab royals would lobby the British Mandatory authorities to address Palestinian Arab concerns about Zionist activity in Palestine. That month, al-Qawuqji left Palestine. Al-Hajj Muhammad followed suit {{and headed for}} Damascus to evade arrest; the British had placed a bounty of 500 <b>pounds</b> <b>on</b> him. While in Damascus, al-Hajj Muhammad raised funds and purchased weapons for the revolt. He also began working with Syrian and Lebanese nationalists to smuggle the arms into Palestine. Al-Hajj Muhammad later left Damascus for the Lebanese mountain village of Qarnayel east of Beirut. From there, he maintained regular communications with his forces.|$|E

His 37 repetitions of 225 <b>pounds</b> <b>on</b> the bench press tied Vernon Gholston for the highest total at the 2008 NFL Combine. In addition to being one of eight {{offensive tackle}}s drafted {{in the first round}} that year, Long was only the third offensive tackle ever to be taken with the first overall pick in the NFL Draft, after Hall of Famer Orlando Pace (1997, a 5-time All-Pro and All-Decade team for the 2000s) and Hall of Famer Ron Yary (1968, an 8-time All-Pro and All-Decade team for the 1970s). The Dolphins drafted Long's college teammate, quarterback Chad Henne, {{in the second round of}} the draft with the 57th overall pick.|$|E

Towards the end of the video, Adam Levine is seen walking through a narrow corridor dragging a guitar with pictures {{on both sides of the}} wall fading in and out. When he reaches the end of the corridor, he is face to face with a wall with a small light coming out of it and then flings his guitar backwards and then <b>pounds</b> <b>on</b> the wall.

When she learns the truth about the shagreen and her role in Raphaël's demise, she is horrified. Raphaël cannot control his desire for her and she rushes into an adjoining room to escape him and so save his life. He <b>pounds</b> <b>on</b> the door and declares both his love and his desire to die in her arms. She, meanwhile, is trying to kill herself to free him from his desire. He breaks down the door, they consummate their love in a fiery moment of passion, and he dies.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial was}} held at the Assizes in the small rural market town of Buckingham. More used to the trials of local poachers and sheep thieves, Buckingham had never before seen such a spectacle. The town was {{inundated}} with journalists and the merely curious. Byrne was charged with manslaughter. Tom Cribb, Reuben Martin, Thomas Reynolds, and George Cooper were charged with aiding and abetting manslaughter. With such illustrious names as Cribb's, Jackson's and Spring's involved, the trial had the potential to turn into a huge establishment scandal. People of all classes had bet hundreds of <b>pounds</b> <b>on</b> the outcome of the boxing match. Despite being banned, prize fighting enjoyed huge public support and patronage from levels up to the younger male members of the Royal family, some of whom Jackson had taught to box. The support received by Byrne at his trial is testimony to the wealth of his backers. The establishment rallied to his support; Byrne was represented by three barristers and five solicitors, and twelve witnesses journeyed from London to give evidence on his behalf.|$|E

5|$|While bishop, Hervey {{ordered the}} {{compilation}} {{of a history}} of the refounding of the abbey of Ely, which later became incorporated into the Liber Eliensis. This was a Latin reworking of an Old English book of grants compiled by Bishop Æthelwold of Winchester. He was energetic in recovering the feudal rights of the bishopric against knights who had intruded themselves on the lands, but were not rendering knight service to the bishop. As bishop, he attended a legatine council, or council held by a papal legate, in 1127, and a royal council in 1129, but otherwise his administrative actions remain obscure. The causeway between the island of Ely and Exning, which made it easier for pilgrims to visit the shrine of Saint Ethelreda, was built under Hervey's orders. Insight into his activities as bishop is given in the Pipe Roll of 1130, the first surviving Pipe Roll. In that record, Hervey is recorded as owing King Henry 45 pounds to provide an office for a nephew, 100 <b>pounds</b> <b>on</b> an old settlement with the king, another 100 pounds for the settlement of a case dealing with Ramsey Abbey, Bury St. Edmunds Abbey and the bishop, 240 pounds for the right to be rid of a surplus of knights, and finally 1000 pounds for the king to allow the bishop's knights to serve castleguard at Ely instead of Norwich.|$|E
5|$|Now in a {{committed}} relationship, Rachel and Adam begin trying for a baby. The storyline was devised because Harries wanted Cold Feet to reflect relevant issues in contemporary society; {{in vitro fertilisation}} featured heavily in the news during 2000, and Harries felt that incorporating it into the series would help {{to raise awareness of}} it, as well as provide fodder for the characters' story arcs. Rachel's intracytoplasmic sperm injection treatment incorporated aspects of the real life IVF treatment experienced by Harries and his wife Rebecca Frayn, and eminent fertility scientist Sammy Lee was consulted extensively throughout the development of the plot. After spending several thousand <b>pounds</b> <b>on</b> IVF treatment, Rachel's doctor informs her that she is infertile due to Asherman's syndrome, most likely caused by her abortion. Despite being unable to have children naturally, Rachel and Adam are determined to continue their relationship; Adam proposes to her and they are married in a civil ceremony in Series 3, Episode 8. In the same episode, she is reunited with her estranged parents, Brian and Mary (Paul Ridley and Sue Holderness). Before the episode, Rachel had not spoken to them for years; her father because of his bigotry and abuse of her mother, and her mother for staying with him. She refuses to allow Paul to give her away, and instead asks David to, despite learning that he has been having an extra-marital affair. At the reception, she inadvertently reveals to her parents that her sister, their other daughter Lucy, has come out as a lesbian.|$|E
