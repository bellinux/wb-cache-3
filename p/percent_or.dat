5|$|The overall case-fatality {{rate for}} ordinary-type {{smallpox}} is about 30 percent, but varies by pock distribution: ordinary type-confluent is fatal about 50–75 {{percent of the}} time, ordinary-type semi-confluent about 25–50 percent of the time, {{in cases where the}} rash is discrete the case-fatality rate is less than 10 percent. The overall fatality rate for children younger than 1 year of age is 40–50 percent. Hemorrhagic and flat types have the highest fatality rates. The fatality rate for flat-type is 90 <b>percent</b> <b>or</b> greater and nearly 100 percent is observed in cases of hemorrhagic smallpox. The case-fatality rate for variola minor is 1 <b>percent</b> <b>or</b> less. There is no evidence of chronic or recurrent infection with variola virus.|$|E

40|$|DXL (Diffuse X-ray {{emission}} {{from the}} Local Galaxy) is a sounding rocket mission designed {{to estimate the}} contribution of solar wind charge eXchange (SWCX) to the diffuse X-ray background and to help determine {{the properties of the}} Local Hot Bubble. The detectors are large area thin-window proportional counters with a spectral response that {{is similar to that of}} the PSPC (Position Sensitive Proportional Counters) used in the ROSAT All Sky Survey (RASS). A direct comparison of DXL and RASS data for the same part of the sky viewed from quite different vantage points in the solar system, and the assumption of approximate isotropy for the solar wind, allowed us to quantify the SWCX contribution to all six RASS bands (R 1 -R 7, excluding R 3). We find that the SWCX contribution at l = 140 degrees, b = 0 degrees, where the DXL path crosses the Galactic plane, is 33 <b>percent</b> plus <b>or</b> minus 6 <b>percent</b> (statistical) plus <b>or</b> minus 12 <b>percent</b> (systematic) for R 1, 44 <b>percent</b> plus <b>or</b> minus 6 <b>percent</b> plus <b>or</b> minus 5 <b>percent</b> for R 2, 18 <b>percent</b> plus <b>or</b> minus 12 <b>percent</b> plus <b>or</b> minus 11 <b>percent</b> for R 4, 14 <b>percent</b> plus <b>or</b> minus 11 <b>percent</b> plus <b>or</b> minus 9 <b>percent</b> for R 5, and negligible for the R 6 and R 7 bands. Reliable models for the distribution of neutral H and He in the solar system permit estimation of the contribution of interplanetary SWCX emission over the the whole sky and correction of the RASS maps. We find that the average SWCX contribution in the whole sky is 26 <b>percent</b> plus <b>or</b> minus 6 <b>percent</b> plus <b>or</b> minus 13 <b>percent</b> for R 1, 30 <b>percent</b> plus <b>or</b> minus 4 <b>percent</b> plus <b>or</b> minus 4 <b>percent</b> for R 2, 8 <b>percent</b> plus <b>or</b> minus 5 <b>percent</b> plus <b>or</b> minus 5 <b>percent</b> for R 4, 6 <b>percent</b> plus <b>or</b> minus 4 <b>percent</b> plus <b>or</b> minus 4 <b>percent</b> for R 5, and negligible for R 6 and R 7...|$|R

The proportion of workers who achieved 100 <b>percent</b> <b>or</b> less of their quota varied from as low as 5.1 percent in iron and steel industries, to 31.4 percent in coal mining.

5|$|Golden and Amber grades {{typically}} have a milder flavour than Dark and Very dark, which are both dark {{and have an}} intense maple flavour. The darker grades of syrup are used primarily for cooking and baking, although some specialty dark syrups are produced for table use. Syrup harvested {{earlier in the season}} tends to yield a lighter colour. With the new grading system, the classification of maple syrup depends ultimately on its internal transmittance at 560 nm wavelength through a 10 mm sample. Golden has to have 75 <b>percent</b> <b>or</b> more transmittance, Amber has to have 50.0 to 74.9 percent transmittance, Dark has to have 25.0 to 49.9 percent transmittance, and Very Dark is any product less than 25.0 percent transmittance.|$|E

Variola minor was a less common presentation, and a much less severe disease, with historical death rates of 1 <b>percent</b> <b>or</b> less. Subclinical (asymptomatic) infections with variola virus were noted but were not common. In addition, a form called variola sine eruptione (smallpox without rash) was seen generally in vaccinated persons. This form was marked by a fever that occurred after the usual incubation period and could be confirmed only by antibody studies or, rarely, by virus isolation.|$|E

Additionally, changes to the Act meant that Militia units were able to serve anywhere south of the Equator in the South West Pacific Area (SWPA), excluding western Java and northern Borneo, {{and as a result of}} this, Militia units saw action against Japanese forces in the Dutch East Indies, at Merauke, later in the war. Despite this, the AIF remained the Australian Army's main combat force during the war and indeed more than 200,000 members of the Militia transferred to the AIF throughout the course of the conflict. Nevertheless, 32 Militia infantry battalions, later organised into three Militia divisions (3rd, 5th and 11th), saw service over much of the South West Pacific and participated in the following campaigns: Salamaua-Lae, Huon Peninsula, Finisterre Range, New Britain and Bougainville.|$|E
