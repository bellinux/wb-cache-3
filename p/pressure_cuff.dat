5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of dengue is typically made clinically, {{on the basis}} of reported symptoms and physical examination; this applies especially in endemic areas. However, early disease can be difficult to differentiate from other viral infections. A probable diagnosis is based on the findings of fever plus two of the following: nausea and vomiting, rash, generalized pains, low white blood cell count, positive tourniquet test, or any warning sign (see table) in someone who lives in an endemic area. Warning signs typically occur before the onset of severe dengue. The tourniquet test, which is particularly useful in settings where no laboratory investigations are readily available, involves the application of a blood <b>pressure</b> <b>cuff</b> at between the diastolic and systolic pressure for five minutes, followed by the counting of any petechial hemorrhages; a higher number makes a {{diagnosis of}} dengue more likely with the cut off being more than 10 to 20 per 1inch2 (6.25cm2).|$|E

40|$|Background: To prevent {{endotracheal tube}} (ETT) -related {{complications}} during mechanical ventilation, ETT <b>cuff</b> <b>pressure</b> {{should be kept}} within proper range. In clinical settings, <b>cuff</b> <b>pressure</b> often decreases from target values. Methods: We performed an experimental study to investigate the effects of measuring devices and endotracheal tubes on change in <b>cuff</b> <b>pressure.</b> We continuously measured <b>cuff</b> <b>pressure</b> by inserting a three-way stopcock {{in the middle of}} an ETT pilot balloon system. After adjusting the <b>cuff</b> <b>pressure</b> to 24 cmH 2 O, we disconnected and reconnected each cuff inflator to the inflation valve of the ETT and measured the changes in the <b>cuff</b> <b>pressure.</b> We measured the change in <b>cuff</b> <b>pressure</b> with different ETT sizes, cuff shapes, brands of cuff inflator, and with and without added extension tubes. Results: The <b>cuff</b> <b>pressure</b> decreased, on average, by 6. 6 cmH 2 O (standard deviation 1. 9), when connecting the cuff inflator to the pilot balloon. The measured <b>cuff</b> <b>pressure</b> was less than 20 cmH 2 O in 67 % of the tests. The <b>cuff</b> <b>pressure</b> decreased more when an extension tube was used. The brand of cuff inflator made no difference to the <b>pressure</b> loss. The <b>cuff</b> <b>pressure</b> decreased more with ETTs of smaller size and with ETTs with pyriform cuffs. Conclusions: Procedures to connect cuff inflators to inflation valves resulted in the loss of <b>cuff</b> <b>pressure</b> by 6. 6 cmH 2 O on average...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{compared}} changes in <b>cuff</b> <b>pressure</b> by {{head and neck}} position between high-volume low-pressure (HVLP) and taper-shaped (taper) cuffs in a prospective randomized clinical trial. Methods. Forty patients were intubated using tracheal tubes with either HVLP (n= 20; HVLP group) or taper-shaped (n= 20; Taper group) <b>cuffs.</b> Initial <b>cuff</b> <b>pressure</b> was adjusted to 15, 20, or 25 [*]cmH 2 O in the neutral position. <b>Cuff</b> <b>pressure</b> was evaluated after changing {{the head and neck}} positions to flexion, extension, and rotation. Results. <b>Cuff</b> <b>pressure</b> significantly increased with flexion in both HVLP and Taper groups at all initial <b>cuff</b> <b>pressures.</b> It significantly increased with extension in the HVLP group, but not in the Taper group. <b>Cuff</b> <b>pressure</b> did not significantly differ with rotation in either group and was significantly smaller in the Taper group during flexion and extension than in the HVLP group, regardless of initial <b>cuff</b> <b>pressure.</b> Conclusion. <b>Cuff</b> <b>pressure</b> changes with head and neck flexion and extension were smaller in the Taper group than in the HVLP group. Our results highlight the potential for taper cuffs to prevent excessive <b>cuff</b> <b>pressure</b> increases with positional changes in the head and neck.

30|$|Conclusion High ETT <b>cuff</b> <b>pressure</b> is {{very common}} on ICU {{admission}} and this can {{set the stage for}} airway complications.

30|$|The {{conventional}} non-invasive {{blood pressure}} monitoring devices {{are designed to}} detect oscillations during deflation. Therefore, they require elevation of the <b>cuff</b> <b>pressure</b> higher than the true systolic <b>pressure.</b> This excessive <b>cuff</b> <b>pressure</b> may cause adverse events such as pain, venous stasis, thrombophlebitis, peripheral neuropathy, and compartment syndrome [4, 5]. Meanwhile, the iNIBP is designed to detect oscillations slowly during inflation and reduce the <b>cuff</b> <b>pressure</b> {{at the time of}} detecting the systolic blood pressure. Thus, it requires lower <b>cuff</b> <b>pressure</b> and shorter time to detect blood pressure as compared to dNIBP [6].|$|R

We found that <b>cuff</b> <b>pressure</b> was decreased by 4. 9 Â± 2. 9 cmH 2 O from the target value. <b>Cuff</b> <b>pressure</b> decreased to less than 20 cmH 2 O in 45 % of measurement occasions 2 h after adjusting it to 24 cmH 2 O...|$|R
50|$|The IVY {{method is}} the {{traditional}} format for this test. While both the IVY and the Duke method {{require the use of}} a sphygmomanometer, or blood <b>pressure</b> <b>cuff,</b> the IVY method is more invasive than the Duke method, utilizing an incision on the ventral side of the forearm, whereas the Duke method involves puncture with a lancet or special needle. In the IVY method, the blood <b>pressure</b> <b>cuff</b> is placed on the upper arm and inflated to 40 mmHg. A lancet or scalpel blade is used to make a shallow incision that is 1 millimeter deep {{on the underside of the}} forearm.|$|E

40|$|In endotracheal intubation, a secured airway {{includes}} an insufflated cuff distal to the vocal cords. High <b>cuff</b> <b>pressures</b> {{may lead to}} major complications occurring after {{a short period of}} time. <b>Cuff</b> <b>pressures</b> are not routinely checked after intubation in the prehospital setting, dealing with a vulnerable group of patients. We reviewed <b>cuff</b> <b>pressures</b> after intubation by Helicopter Emergency Medical Services and paramedics noted in a dispatch database. Initial <b>cuff</b> <b>pressures</b> are almost all too high, needing adjustment to be in the safe zone. Dutch paramedics lack manometers and, therefore, only few paramedic intubations are followed by <b>cuff</b> <b>pressure</b> measurements. We recommend <b>cuff</b> <b>pressure</b> measurements after all (prehospital) intubations and, therefore, all ambulances need to be equipped with cuff manometers...|$|R
40|$|Background: Endotracheal tubes (ETTs) play an {{integral}} part in anaesthesia. ETT <b>cuff</b> <b>pressure</b> commonly exceeds the recommended range of 20 - 30 cm Hâ 0 during anaesthesia. This can lead to serious morbidity. No objective means of ETT <b>cuff</b> <b>pressure</b> monitoring {{is available in the}} operating theatres of Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital (CMJAH) and Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital (CHBAH). The ETT <b>cuff</b> <b>pressure</b> of patients undergoing general anaesthesia is therefore unknown. Aim: The aim {{of this study was to}} determine what the actual ETT <b>cuff</b> <b>pressures</b> were of patients receiving general anaesthesia at CMJAH and CHBAH and to document the cuff inflation techniques that were used to achieve these <b>pressures.</b> Method: ETT <b>cuff</b> <b>pressure</b> of 96 adult patients undergoing general anaesthesia without nitrous oxide at CMJAH and CHBAH were measured. A RUSCH Endotest aneroid manometer was used to measure ETT <b>cuff</b> <b>pressure</b> in size 7. 0 â 8. 5 mm ETTs. The cuff inflation technique that was used by the anaesthetist was also documented. Anaesthetists were blinded to the study. Results: The mean ETT <b>cuff</b> <b>pressure</b> recorded was 47. 5 cm Hâ 0 (range 10 â 120 cm Hâ 0). ETT <b>cuff</b> <b>pressures</b> exceeded 30 cm Hâ 0 in 64. 58...|$|R
30|$|Whilst {{control of}} <b>cuff</b> <b>pressure</b> using a {{manometer}} is not efficient in keeping <b>cuff</b> <b>pressure</b> within {{the zone of}} 20 to 30 cmH 2 O, this measure is probably better than no control at all. Several {{studies have shown that}} the finger method is inaccurate in estimating <b>cuff</b> <b>pressure,</b> and that patients could spend a long period of time with underinflation or overinflation of <b>cuff</b> <b>pressure</b> when no adjustment is performed at all [30]. Further, a recent randomized controlled study performed on a large number of patients scheduled for elective surgery found proper control of <b>cuff</b> <b>pressure</b> using a manometer to be associated with significantly reduced clinical complications such as cough, sore throat, hoarseness, and blood-streaked expectorant, related to cuff overinflation compared with no measurement of <b>cuff</b> <b>pressure</b> [64]. However, to our knowledge, no study has evaluated the impact of discontinuous control of <b>cuff</b> <b>pressure</b> using a manometer on the incidence of complications related to underinflation or overinflation of tracheal cuff in ICU patients.|$|R

5000|$|The {{condition}} of the control loop {{can be described as}} follows: The light-signal PG shall become zero by controlling the alterable <b>pressure</b> in the <b>cuff.</b> During systole, when blood volume increases in the finger, the PID-controller increases the control point. Thus, <b>cuff</b> <b>pressure</b> is increased until the excess blood volume is squeezed out. On the other hand, during diastole, the blood volume in the finger is decreased; as a result the PID-controller decreases the control point. Hence, <b>cuff</b> <b>pressure</b> is lowered and the overall blood volume remains constant. As blood volume and thus PG is held constant over time, the <b>pressure</b> difference between <b>cuff</b> <b>pressure</b> and intra-arterial pressure is zero. Intra-arterial pressure is equal to <b>cuff</b> <b>pressure,</b> which can easily be measured by means of the manometer M.|$|R
50|$|Eventually, as the <b>pressure</b> in the <b>cuff</b> drops further, {{the sounds}} change in quality, then become muted, and finally {{disappear}} altogether.
