At first, the design parameters of piezoelectric actuator are analyzed by finite element method to determine the position of fixed end and minimum voltage to actuate 0. 7 mm displacement and 15 g output force. Then, the optimum design is performed according to the electric displacement 0. 7 mm, output force 15 g, actuator length, position of fixed end and minimum voltage. Finally, Braille display cell is analyzed by dynamic simulation software. It shows that actuators take 0. 0002 sec to upward achieve 0. 7 mm displacement. The result of optimum design is reasonable in this paper which can be the reference for related research...|$|R
40|$|The {{lead-free}} <b>piezoelectric</b> ceramics <b>display</b> good <b>piezoelectric</b> properties {{which are}} comparable with Pb(Zr,Ti) O 3 (PZT) and these materials overcome the hazard {{to the environment}} and human health. The Bi 0. 5 (Na,K) 0. 5 TiO 3 (BNKT) is rapidly developed because of good piezoelectric, ferroelectric, and dielectric properties compared to PZT. The origin of giant strain of BNKT piezoelectric materials was found at morphotropic phase boundary due to crystal change from tetragonal to orthorhombic and/or precipitation of cubic phases, in addition to domain switching mechanism. The dopants or secondary phases with ABO 3 structure as solid solution are expected to change the crystal structure and create the vacancies which results in enhancement of the piezoelectric properties. In this work, we reviewed the current development of BNKT by dopants and secondary phase as solid solution. Our discussion will focus on role of dopants and secondary phase to piezoelectric properties of BNKT. This result will open the direction to control the properties of lead-free piezoelectric materials...|$|R

In applied fields of 1. 85 - 5. 70 x Ec cracks grow to a common limiting length which is approximately 0. 8 times the separation between the electrodes.

40|$|The relaxor-based single {{crystals}} {{of complex}} perovskite solid solutions, Pb(Mg 1 / 3 Nb 2 / 3) O 3 -PbTiO 3 [PMN-PT] and Pb(Zn 1 / 3 Nb 2 / 3) O 3 -PbTiO 3 [PZN-PT], exhibit extraordinary <b>piezoelectric</b> performance: <b>displaying</b> extremely high <b>piezoelectric</b> coefficients, very large electromechanical coupling factors, and exceptionally high strain. These materials outperform the currently used Pb(Zr 1 -x Ti x) O 3 [PZT] ceramics, making them the materials {{of choice for}} the next generation of electromechanical transducers for a broad range of advanced applications. In this article, the PZN-xPT (x= 0. 07 - 0. 11) single crystals near the morphotropic phase boundary were prepared using the top-seeded solution growth technique. Ferro-/dielectric and piezoelectric properties, crystal chemistry, domain structure, and electromechanical coupling properties were systematically characterized. It is showed that the top-seeded solution growth method is an effective alternative technique for preparing the high quality PZN-xPT ferroelectric crystals, which is effective in controlling nucleation/growth of the PZN-xPT single crystals and suppressing the undesired Pb deficient pyrochlore phase by providing a Pb rich environment.

40|$|Metal {{chalcogenides}} (sulfides, selenides and tellurides) are {{materials of}} current interest {{due to their}} peculiar properties such as optoelectronic, magnetooptic, thermoelectric and <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>displays.</b> These semiconducting materials have potential applications in solar cell devices, infrared detectors and ambient thermoelectric generators. Previously, these materials have been deposited by multiple-source precursor route with several problems associated with this technique. This work describes the synthesis of metal complexes (Zn, Cd, Fe, Ni, Pd, Pt) using the imidodichalcogenodiphosphinate ligand (Woollins ligand). Their thermal decomposition together with structural and spectroscopy analysis was carried out. The complexes were used as single source precursors for the deposition of cadmium selenide, cadmium phosphide, cadmium sulfide, zinc selenide, iron selenide and the tellurides of nickel, palladium, platinum and iron as thin films and powders. These were deposited by AACVD and pyrolysis. The deposited thin films and powders were characterised by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive analysis of X-rays (EDAX), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and {{superconducting quantum interference device}} (SQUID). The cadmium complexes [Cd{iPr 2 P(Se) NP(Se) iPr 2 } 2] and [Cd{iPr 2 P(S) NP(Se) iPr 2 } 2] deposited the mixture of hexagonal CdSe and monoclinic Cd 2 P 3 films at the flow rate of 160 sccm at 475 and 500 °C. At the flow rate of 240 sccm, only hexagonal CdSe was deposited from [Cd{iPr 2 P(Se) NP(Se) iPr 2 } 2] at all temperatures. Hexagonal CdS and the mixture of orthorhombic Cd 6 P 7 /cubic Cd 7 P 10 were deposited from [Cd{iPr 2 P(S) NP(S) iPr 2 } 2]. The zinc complexes [Zn{iPr 2 P(Se) NP(Se) iPr 2 } 2] and [Zn{iPr 2 P(S) NP(Se) iPr 2 } 2] both deposited cubic ZnSe at all temperatures with the flow rates of 160 and 240 sccm. The iron complexes [Fe{(SePPh 2) 2 N} 2] and [Fe{(SePPh 2 NPPh 2 S) 2 N} 2] deposited orthorhombic FeSe 2 mixed with monoclinic Fe 3 Se 4 by pyrolysis at 500 and 550 °C. An unresolved pattern was observed from the complex [Fe{(SePPh 2 NPPh 2 S) 2 N} 2] at 550 °C. XPS analysis of the deposited FeSe 2 showed the surface oxidation of the material, while the magnetic measurements on the sample using SQUID confirmed its ferromagnetic properties. The telluride complexes of nickel, palladium, platinum and iron deposited the metal telluride respectively as: hexagonal NiTe, hexagonal PdTe, hexagonal PtTe 2 (mixed with rhombohedral PtTe) and hexagonal FeTe 2. Conductivity studies on NiTe and PdTe revealed them to be insulators, while the magnetic measurements on FeTe 2 indicated its antiferromagnetic behaviour.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{our findings}} {{during the study}} of a novel system that yields multi-colored materials as products. This system is quite unusual as it leads to multi-chromic behavior in single crystals, where {{one would expect that}} only a single color would exist. We have speculated that these novel solids might play a role in materials applications such as non-linear optics, liquid crystal <b>displays,</b> <b>piezoelectric</b> devices, and other similar applications. The system examined consisted of a main-group alkyl compound (a p block element such as gallium or aluminum) complexed with various organic di-imines. The di-imines had substituents of two types [...] either alkyl or aromatic groups attached to the nitrogen atoms. We observed that single crystals, characterized by X-ray crystallography, were obtained in most cases. Our research during January-July, 2006, was geared towards understanding the factors leading to the multi-chromic nature of the complexes. The main possibilities put forth initially considered (a) the chiral nature of the main group metal, (b) possible reduction of the metal to a lower-valent, radical state, (c) the nature of the ligand(s) attached to the main group metal, and (d) possible degradation products of the ligand leading to highly-colored products. The work carried out indicates that the most likely explanation considered involves degradation of the aromatic ligands (a combination of (c) and (d)), as the experiments performed can clearly rule out (a) and (b) ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe whisker to barrel {{system in}} rodents {{has become one}} of the major models for the study of sensory processing. Several tens of {{whiskers}} (or vibrissae) are distributed in a regular manner on both sides of the snout. Many tactile discrimination tasks using this system need multiple contacts with more than one whisker to be solved. With the aim of mimicking those multi-whisker stimuli during electrophysiological recordings, we developed a novel mechanical stimulator composed of 24 independent multi-directional piezoelectric benders adapted to the five rows and the five caudal arcs of the rat whisker pad. The most widely used technology for producing mechanical deflections of the whiskers is based on <b>piezoelectric</b> benders that <b>display</b> a non-linear behavior when driven with high frequency input commands and, if not compensated, show high unwanted ringing at particular resonance frequencies. If not corrected, this non-linear behavior precludes the application of high frequency deflections and the study of cortical responses to behaviorally relevant stimuli. To cope with the ringing problem, a mechanical and a software based solutions have been developed. With these corrections, the upper bound of the linear range of the bender is increased to 1 kHz. This new device allows the controlled delivery of large scale natural patterns of whisker deflections characterized by rapid high frequency vibrations of multiple whiskers...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{floating}} zone method (FZM) {{is used to}} grow large crystal ingots of lead-free (K 0. 5 Na 0. 5) NbO 3 (KNN), (K 0. 5 Na 0. 5) (Nb 0. 95 Mn 0. 05) O 3 (KNN-Mn), and (K 0. 5 Na 0. 5) (Nb 0. 95 Ta 0. 05) O 3 (KNN-Ta). FZM allows {{high quality}} crystal to be obtained without using a crucible. However, the KNN molten zone is instable at high temperature (∼ 1200 °C) due to its incongruent melting and alkali segregation. The challenge of this work is to control the stability and the viscosity of the molten zone which allows long growth {{in order to achieve}} large volume single crystals. Our work reveals that the use of a slight overpressure of gas (O 2 or N 2) and doping KNN with Mn and Ta allows the molten zone to be maintained over 50 h. In such conditions, the as-grown crystals are preferentially oriented along the [011] direction and <b>display</b> <b>piezoelectric</b> properties such as kt of 0. 48, d 33 of 65 – 70 pC/N, ε 33,rS of 123 – 148, δe of 0. 03 – 0. 07, and δm of 0. 11 – 0. 21. The ferroelectric measurements show saturated hysteresis loops with a decrease in EC and Pr when attaining single crystal after several hours of growth. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) investigations show complex domain structures that are mainly attributed to the accommodation of the stresses occurring during the crystal growth in the high thermal gradient and in the phase transition from tetragonal to orthorhombic phases during cooling...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOriginal telomers {{based on}} vinylidene {{fluoride}} (VDF), CnF 2 n+ 1 (VDF) m(CH 2 CH 2) pI, where n¼ 4 or 6, m¼ 5 – 23 and P¼ 0 or 1, were synthesized, and the piezoelectric {{properties of the}} materials were investigated. Low-molecular-weight polyvinylidene fluorides (PVDFs) were prepared in good yields by iodine transfer polymerization of VDF. The polymerization of VDF was conducted {{in the presence of}} 1 -iodoperfluoroalkanes (C 4 F 9 I or C 6 F 13 I) and bis(4 - ert-butylcyclohexyl) peroxydicarbonate, which were used as a chain transfer agent and initiator, respectively. The microstructure of VDF telomers was carefully characterized by 1 H and 19 F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to assess the average molecular weight and the percentage of CH 2 CF 2 I functionality (that ranged from 47 to 86 %). X-ray diffraction patterns of these telomers indicated that PVDFs with o 6 VDF units displayed the a-form. Alternatively, telomers containing a higher amount of VDF possessed both a- and b-forms. Ethylene endcapping of CnF 2 n+ 1 (VDF) mI was also successfully achieved in high yield, and the telomeric precursors were converted quantitatively. Moreover, three VDF telomers were vaporized into films, and the piezoelectric properties of the materials were assessed. The results revealed that C 6 F 13 (VDF) 23 I and C 4 F 9 (VDF) 21 I telomer films <b>displayed</b> <b>piezoelectric</b> responses (d 33 ¼ 268 pCN 1) and high remanent polarizations (Pr¼ 98. 2 and 93. 4 mCm 2, respectively).

40|$|Hydroxyapatite (HA) bioceramics are commercially {{available}} as bone graft substitute materials. The {{aim of the}} current research was to characterise the electrical properties of hydroxyapatite-barium titanate (HABT) composites and to assess in vitro biological responses to the composites in order to investigate their potential use as bone graft substitutes. A range of HABT ceramics of different compositions was manufactured and their electrical properties were measured. The microstructure and piezoelectric properties of the ceramics were both dependent on the proportion of barium titanate (BT) present. Composites containing more than 70 % BT <b>displayed</b> <b>piezoelectric</b> charge coefficients (d 33) of up to 86. 3 ± 7. 9 pCN- 1 (95 % BT). The ferroelectric nature of the 90 and 95 % BT materials was confirmed by assessment of their ferroelectric hysteresis loops. The highest piezoelectric voltage coefficient (g 33) recorded was 14 x 10 - 3 Vm- 1 Pa- 1 (90 % BT). Following {{the assessment of the}} electrical properties, the HABT ceramic containing 90 % BT was selected for the assessment of biological responses to the composites. The proliferation, viability, activity and morphology of human osteoblast-like cells cultured on HABT were comparable to those cultured on hydroxyapatite (HA) up to 7 days after seeding. The remnant polarisation of poled HABT induced an increase in cell attachment. This influence was independent of the nature (positive or negative) of the polarisation. Poling was not found to influence cell morphology, activity or differentiation in the first 7 days of incubation. At 14 days after seeding, results were inconsistent, indicating some variations in cell population and differentiation depending on the composition and poling of the ceramics respectively. This study has substantially defined the electrical properties of a range of HABT ceramics. It indicates their in vitro biocompatibility and thus their potential for use as bone graft substitutes. These results provide a benchmark against which future work investigating the influence of mechanical loading and longer term studies may be measured.
