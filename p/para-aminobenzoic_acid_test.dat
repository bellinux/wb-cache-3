40|$|By {{injection}} into typhus-infected yolk sacs, {{a number}} of agents were tested for possible inhibition or acceleration of rickettsial growth. The previously reported rickettsiostatic activity of penicillin was further confirmed. <b>Para-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid,</b> in single injections of 6. 6 mg. and 3. 3 mg. giving initial concentrations of approximately 1 : 6000 and 1 : 12, 000 {{was found to have}} rickettsiostatic activity approximately equal to that of penicillin. No conclusion could be drawn regarding the possibility of a synergistic action of <b>para-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid</b> and penicillin. <b>Para-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid</b> neutralized with sodium hydroxide was found to be as effective as the acid itself, when given in single injections of 6. 6 mg. Sodium benzoate, as Well as the ortho and meta forms of aminobenzoic acid were found to be ineffective when given in similar amounts. <b>Para-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid,</b> when added to the food in a concentration of 3 per cent, was shown to have a remarkably effective chemotherapeutic action on murine typhus infection in mice. Sodium fluoride was found at times to accelerate the growth of rickettsiae in the yolk sac, and to cause heavy infection under conditions such that the controls showed practically no multiplication of the organism. When rickettsiostatic substances (penicillin and <b>para-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid)</b> were combined with sodium fluoride, their rickettsiostatic activity was not demonstrably changed.

40|$|Abstract Extraintestinal manifestations in {{inflammatory}} bowel disease (IBD) {{have been}} described with varying frequencies. The {{aim of this study}} was to estimate the prevalence of pancreatic duct abnormalities, exocrine and endocrine dysfunction, elevated pancreatic enzymes, hepato-biliary disease, coexisting cholangiographic and pancreatographic duct changes, and elevated serum levels of fibrosis markers in IBD, and to correlate the findings with clinical, endoscopic and histologic variables. From a local patient register, 237 patients were randomly selected and studied. Of these, 170 had ulcerative colitis (UC), 46 had Crohn's disease (CD), and 21 had indeterminate colitis (IC). A detailed history was obtained from medical records and in a face-to-face interview. The patients were screened with a <b>para-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid</b> (PABA) <b>test</b> and, for pancreatic enzymes, liver function tests, serum aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen (PIIINP), and laminin. Further pancreatic evaluation included endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreato-graphy (ERCP), ultrasound (US), secretin test, and glucagon C-peptide test. Further hepatobiliary evaluation consisted of ERCP, US, and liver biopsy. In IBD, the prevalence rates of pancreatic duct abnormalities and exocrine dysfunction were 8 % and 4 %, respectively. Parallel impairment of exocrine and endocrine functions was shown. Acute idiopathic pancreatitis may complicate IBD. About 7 - 17 % presented with elevated pancreatic enzymes. Enzyme elevation was associated with extensive and histologically active disease and, in some cases, with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Abnormal liver test results were commoner in patients with CD than in patients with UC (30 % versus 11 %). The prevalence of PSC in IBD was 11 %, which is higher than previously reported (3. 7 - 7. 5 %). PSC was commoner in patients with CD than in patients with UC (17. 4 % versus 7. 6 %). About half of the PSC patients had concomitant pancreatic duct changes, and the prevalence of concurrent cholangiographic and pancreatographic duct changes in IBD was 4. 6 %. Both serum PIIINP and laminin were increased in IBD patients. This was not only seen in patients with hepatobiliary disease and PSC, but also in patients with pancreatic disease. In conclusion, pancreatic and hepatobiliary complications in IBD occur with high and similar frequencies in all IBD categories and are associated with each other. They are not clearly associated with the clinical course of IBD...|$|R

40|$|The time of {{blending}} the rickettsial inoculum, as {{also the}} strain of hen's egg employed, influenced the degree of infection which developed in fertile eggs after the injection of typhus rickettsiae into the yolk sac. By varying these factors, maximal or minimal infections could be obtained. Eggs incubated at 40 °C. developed only minimal rickettsial infection, whereas control eggs incubated at 37. 5 °C. became heavily infected. Potassium cyanide markedly enhanced rickettsial growth in experiments in which the control eggs developed only minimal infection. Under circumstances such that the control eggs became heavily infected, KCN had no appreciable effect. Toluidin blue and methylene blue delayed the development of rickettsial infection in the yolk sac, but their rickettsiostatic action under the conditions of these experiments was less marked than that of penicillin and <b>para-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid.</b> The rickettsiostatic action resulting from temperature elevation was neutralized by KCN, and hence {{is believed to be}} due to the increased activity of the cyanide-sensitive respiratory enzyme (cytochrome oxidase) in the entodermal cells in which the rickettsiae multiply. The rickettsiostatic action of toluidin blue and methylene blue, though probably also resulting from increased metabolic activity in the entodermal cells, was not neutralized by KCN. This observation is in harmony with the reported observation that dyes of this type furnish an alternative mechanism for intracellular oxidation which is cyanide-insensitive. The rickettsiostatic action of <b>para-aminobenzoic</b> <b>acid</b> was not neutralized by KCN. No conclusions can be reached at present concerning the mechanism of action of this compound.
