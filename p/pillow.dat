5|$|Despite the {{successful}} morning attack, {{access to an}} open escape route, and to the amazement of Floyd and Buckner, <b>Pillow</b> ordered his men back to their trenches by 1:30p.m. Buckner confronted <b>Pillow,</b> and Floyd intended to countermand the order, but <b>Pillow</b> argued that his men needed to regroup and resupply before evacuating the fort. <b>Pillow</b> won the argument. Floyd also believed that C. F. Smith's division was being heavily reinforced, so the entire Confederate force was ordered back inside the lines of Fort Donelson, giving up the ground they gained earlier that day.|$|E
5|$|Late {{that night}} the generals held a council of war in which Floyd and <b>Pillow</b> {{expressed}} satisfaction with {{the events of the}} day, but Buckner convinced them that they had little realistic chance to hold the fort or escape from Grant's army, which was receiving steady reinforcements. General Floyd, concerned he would be tried for treason if captured by the North, sought Buckner's assurance that he would be given time to escape with some of his Virginia regiments before the army surrendered. Buckner agreed and Floyd offered to turn over command to his subordinate, <b>Pillow.</b> <b>Pillow</b> immediately declined and passed command to Buckner, who agreed to stay behind and surrender. Both Generals Floyd and <b>Pillow</b> left to leave General Buckner to surrender to the Union Forces. <b>Pillow</b> and Floyd were able to escape, as did cavalry commander Col. Nathan Bedford Forrest.|$|E

5|$|Seamounts are {{volcanic}} mountains which {{rise from}} the seafloor. The unlimited supply of water surrounding these volcanoes can cause them to behave differently from volcanoes on land. The lava emitted in eruptions at Bowie Seamount is made of basalt, a common gray to black or dark brown volcanic rock low in silica content (the lava is mafic). When basaltic lava makes contact with the cold sea water, it may cool very rapidly to form <b>pillow</b> lava, through which the hot lava breaks to form another <b>pillow.</b> <b>Pillow</b> lava is typically fine-grained, due to rapid cooling, with a glassy crust, and has radial jointing.|$|E
5|$|With Floyd's arrival to take {{command of}} Fort Donelson, <b>Pillow</b> took over leading the Confederate left. Feeling overwhelmed, Floyd left {{most of the}} actual command to <b>Pillow</b> and Buckner.

5|$|On February 11, Buckner relayed {{orders to}} <b>Pillow</b> from Floyd to release Floyd's and Buckner's troops to operate {{south of the}} river, near Cumberland City, {{where they would be}} able to attack the Union supply lines while keeping a clear path back to Nashville. However, this would leave the Confederate forces at Fort Donelson heavily outnumbered. <b>Pillow</b> left early on the morning of February 12 to argue these orders with General Floyd himself leaving Buckner in charge of the fort. After hearing sounds of {{artillery}} fire, <b>Pillow</b> returned to Fort Donelson to resume command. After the events of the day, Buckner remained at Fort Donelson to command the Confederate right. With the arrival of Grant's army, General Johnston ordered Floyd to take any troops remaining in Clarksville to aid in the defense of Fort Donelson.|$|E
5|$|At 1:00a.m. on February 14, Floyd held {{a council}} {{of war in}} his {{headquarters}} at the Dover Hotel. There was general agreement that Fort Donelson was probably untenable. General <b>Pillow</b> was designated to lead a breakout attempt, evacuate the fort, and march to Nashville. Troops were moved behind the lines and the assault readied, {{but at the last}} minute a Union sharpshooter killed one of Pillow's aides. <b>Pillow,</b> normally quite aggressive in battle, was unnerved and announced that since their movement had been detected, the breakout had to be postponed. Floyd was furious at this change of plans, but by then it was too late in the day to proceed.|$|E

5|$|Floyd's Confederate {{force of}} {{approximately}} 17,000 men {{consisted of three}} divisions (Army of Central Kentucky), garrison troops, and attached cavalry. The three divisions were commanded by Floyd (replaced by Colonel Gabriel C. Wharton when Floyd took command of the entire force) and Brig. Gens. Bushrod Johnson and Simon Bolivar Buckner. During the battle, Johnson, the engineering officer who briefly commanded Fort Donelson in late January, was effectively superseded by Brig. Gen. Gideon J. <b>Pillow</b> (Grant's opponent at his first battle at Belmont). <b>Pillow,</b> who arrived at Fort Donelson on February 9, was displaced from overall command of the fort when the more-senior Floyd arrived. The garrison troops were commanded by Col. John W. Head and the cavalry by Col. Nathan Bedford Forrest.|$|E

5|$|Sei Shōnagon, {{author of}} The <b>Pillow</b> Book, {{had been in}} service as lady-in-waiting to Teishi when Shōshi came to court; it is {{possible}} that Murasaki was invited to Shōshi's court as a rival to Shōnagon. Teishi died in 1001, before Murasaki entered service with Shōshi, so the two writers were not there concurrently, but Murasaki, who wrote about Shōnagon in her diary, certainly knew of her, and to an extent was influenced by her. Shōnagon's The <b>Pillow</b> Book may have been commissioned as a type of propaganda to highlight Teishi's court, known for its educated ladies-in-waiting. Japanese literature scholar Joshua Mostow believes Michinaga provided Murasaki to Shōshi as an equally or better educated woman, so as to showcase Shōshi's court in a similar manner.|$|E

5|$|The various {{formations}} of Siletzia {{are characterized}} as marine tholeiitic <b>pillow</b> basalts and volcanic breccia, often interbedded with sedimentary layers of continental origin, lying on oceanic crust. These are usually capped by {{a layer of}} alkalic volcanics deposited subaerially. All this suggests these formations were initially deposited in an oceanic environment, possibly as seamounts or an island arc.|$|E
5|$|This {{life cycle}} {{consists}} of several stages. The first stage is the submarine preshield stage, currently represented solely by Lōʻihi Seamount. During this stage, the volcano builds height through increasingly frequent eruptions. The sea's pressure prevents explosive eruptions. The cold water quickly solidifies the lava, producing the <b>pillow</b> lava that {{is typical of}} underwater volcanic activity.|$|E

5|$|Exposed {{along the}} Cheakamus River {{and its tributaries}} are the Cheakamus Valley basalts. Although not {{necessarily}} mapped {{as part of the}} Cayley field, this sequence of basaltic lava flows is geologically similar and comparable in age to volcanic features that are part of this volcanic field. At least four basaltic flows comprise the sequence and were deposited during periods of volcanic activity from an unknown vent between 0.01and 1.6million years ago. <b>Pillow</b> lava is abundant along the bases the flows, some of which are underlain by hyaloclastite breccia. In 1958, Canadian volcanologist Bill Mathews suggested that the lava flows were erupted during periods of subglacial activity and traveled through trenches or tunnels melted in glacial ice of the Fraser Glaciation. Mathews based this on the age of the underlying till, the existence of <b>pillow</b> lava close to the bottom of some lavas, indicating subaqueous volcanism, the columnar jointing {{at the edges of the}} lavas, indicating rapid cooling, and the absence of apparent palaeogeography.|$|E

40|$|<b>Pillows</b> {{are known}} to contain {{significant}} levels of indoor allergens and endotoxin, that are of importance to house dust mite sensitized asthmatics.

We studied the levels of the house dust mite allergen, Der f 1, and endotoxin on new synthetic and buckwheat <b>pillows</b> and their accumulation over three months. Endotoxin levels were significantly higher on new buckwheat <b>pillows</b> compared to synthetic pillows; geometric mean levels (95 % CI) were 60, 950 EU/g (30, 270 - 122, 700) and 4, 887 EU/g (2, 570 - 9, 311) respectively (p< 0. 001). No Der f 1 was detected on the new <b>pillows.</b> After three months Der f 1 levels were similar on buckwheat and synthetic <b>pillows,</b> geometric mean levels (95 % CI) were 1. 16 g/g (0. 02 - 8. 13) and 1. 08 g/g (0. 19 - 1. 68) respectively.
