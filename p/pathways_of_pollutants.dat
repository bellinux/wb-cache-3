40|$|International audienceOur works {{focused on}} the impact of megacities on oxidating {{pollution}} in Europe, depending on the size, location and possible structural evolution of the cities. By means of anthropogenic emissions sensitivity studies, we showed that the existence of high emitting countries/regions in Europe (BeNeLux in particular) prevails over the existence of large and dense cities for the determination of pollution gradients in Europe. Our results also indicate that the concentration of the urban built (by opposition to city spreading) may reinforce secondary pollution locally (through fast ozone production). However it has limited impact on the total quantity of oxidants produced over Europe. Finally, simulations with passive tracer emissions allowed us to conclude that city spreading over new territories could alter the geographical export <b>pathways</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> from cities towards the rest of the continent...|$|E

40|$|We use carbon {{monoxide}} (CO) measurements from MLS and TES, and cloud water content measurements from CloudSat {{to identify the}} transport <b>pathways</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> generated by tropical biomass burning to the upper troposphere (UT). There appeared to be three pathways that transport CO from its surface sources to the UT: “local convection”, “UT advection ” and “lower troposphere (LT) advection → convection”. The dominant transport pathway varies geographically. The “local-convection ” and “LT advection → convection ” pathways were the main contributors for high CO in the UT over Africa, whereas long-range “UT advection” pathway appeared to transport CO to the UT over tropical South America and Atlantic Ocean. This case study suggests that our method of identifying these pathways through joint use of multiple A-Train satellite sensors can potentially be applied to address the need of characterizing and understanding the climatological variations of the dominant pathways for CO transport to the UT. ...|$|E

For the case with windward pollutant emission at the 3 rd floor within a re-entry, the pollutant migrated downwards due to the downwash created by the wind.

40|$|Preface. Laurent Charlet: Editor of the Journal of Hydrology. International audienceIf {{pollutants}} {{would always}} {{remain in the}} compartments they were deposited in, a lot of environmentalists would have to worry a lot less about. Most environmental pressures, however, develop a dynamic behavior and numerous processes govern the <b>pathway</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> in the environment. They range from complex input functions into soils and surface water to migration processes in soil, groundwater, surface water and sediments to redistribution processes from soil and water into the atmosphere. Most environmental research aims to understand, parameterize, and model these processes that may be of chemical, biological, and physical nature. For this work, various spatial scales need to be considered. These range from pore size studies to basin-wide investigations whereas time scales <b>of</b> <b>pollutant</b> mobility range from hours to centuries {{and in some cases}} thousands of years. In addition, input and spreading behavior <b>of</b> environmental <b>pollutants</b> is often diffuse rather than clearly defined in time and space.

40|$|An {{overview}} of issues with environmental relevance {{that arise from}} the interaction between pollutants and surfaces of the built environment is presented in this paper. Two broad perspectives are considered: decay of materials and recording of pollution characteristics. In relation to the former, we consider the possible implications on human activities restrictions, materials and morphological options, consumption of resources and release of pollutants resulting from the alteration of materials, conservation and restoration procedures. In terms of pollution recording, {{the interest of the}} stony materials as passive monitors of pollution, the question of heterogeneous conditions on buildings and the interest of qualitative and quantitative studies are highlighted. The importance of longitudinal studies on new and cleaned surfaces is considered, both for the understanding of materials decay and for the assessment of pollution conditions. The use of tracers to record the characteristics of pollution sources, interaction with materials and <b>pathways</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> is also discussed. Finally, some recommendations are presented, based on the issues discussed on this paper that might be relevant for environmental management programs, including environmental education.

40|$|Recently, {{combined}} carbon and hydrogen isotope fractionation investigations {{have emerged as}} {{a powerful tool for}} the characterization of reaction mechanisms relevant for the removal of organic pollutants. Here, we applied this approach in order to differentiate benzene biodegradation pathways under oxic and anoxic conditions in laboratory experiments. Carbon and hydrogen isotope fractionation of benzene was studied with four different aerobic strains using a monooxygenase or a dioxygenase for the initial benzene attack, a facultative anaerobic chlorate-reducing strain as well as a sulfate-reducing mixed culture. Carbon and hydrogen enrichment factors (epsilon(C), epsilon(H)) varied for the specific pathways and degradation conditions, respectively, so that from the individual enrichment factors only limited information could be obtained for the identification of benzene biodegradation pathways. However, using the slope derived from hydrogen vs carbon isotope discriminations or the ratio of hydrogen to carbon enrichment factors (lambda = deltaH/ deltaC approximately epsilon(H) /epsilon(C)), benzene degradation mechanisms could be distinguished. Although experimentally determined lambda values partially overlapped, ranges could be determined for different benzene biodegradation pathways. Specific lambda values were 17 for anaerobic degradation. Moreover, variations in lambda values suggest that more than one reaction mechanism exists for monohydroxylation as well as for anaerobic benzene degradation under nitrate-reducing, sulfate-reducing, or methanogenic conditions.

40|$|The {{choice of}} {{stormwater}} procedures {{will affect the}} pathways {{of the water and}} its pollutants, since different stormwater facilities reduce different types of substances and fractions to varying degrees. Traditional stormwater handling has mainly been emphasised to transport the water from the cities. However, during the last year, the interest in environmental aspects has increased. Different ecological solutions, such as infiltration, wetlands, and swales will affect the path of water and its substances. The main objective of this thesis is to characterize and study the <b>pathways</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> (heavy metal and organic substances) in stormwater systems. The main focus has been on gully pot water and sediment after it has been removed from the grit chamber. In order to study the <b>pathways</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutants,</b> a substance flow analysis was done in Hammarby Sjöstad. Since no measurements were possible in the area, theoretical calculations were performed. The results show that, in a separate system with treatment, most of the pollutants will end up in the sediment or soil, depending on which BMP is used. The largest amount of pollutants will be discharged to receiving waters with a separate system without treatment. The samples of gully pot water and sediment were taken during the autumn 2004 in Luleå, Sweden. Three different sites were chosen due to different types of area and traffic loads: a residential area with 500 v/d and two sites in the city with different traffic intensities, 13, 800 v/d and 25, 500 v/d, respectively. The water samples were analysed for particle-size distribution, suspended solids (SS), heavy metals, PAH, phthalate, and nonylphenols, while the sediment samples were analysed for particle-size distribution and heavy metals. The metals in the water phase were analysed for six fractions: truly dissolved (< 1 kD), colloids, < 0. 2 µm, < 0. 45 µm, and two different extracted fractions. The results showed that the gully pot mixture (water and sediment) contained a wide range of substances. For the different fractions in the water phase, the highest concentration of metals varied between the three sampling sites. All analysed metals were found in the mixture and, out of 29 organic substances, 18 were detected. Most of the metals and PAH were attached to particles in the water. The concentration of PAH was highest in the city with 13, 800 v/d. The only phthalates substance detected in all three areas was di-(2 -etylhexyl) phthalate and the highest total concentration was found in the residential area. The concentration of total 4 -nonylphenol was detected only in the residential area. The sediment's smallest fraction (< 63 µm) had the highest concentration of metals. The leaching test indicates that the metals in the sediment are harder bound in the city. However, in the water, the metals are harder bound in the residential area. The water exceeds the guidelines for freshwater for most of the substances, while the sediment only exceeds the guidelines for soil for a few substances. This indicates that the gully pot mixture must undergo treatment before it can be discharged to the environment. Godkänd; 2006; 20070109 (haneit...|$|E

Molecular analysis of predator gut content can, however, rapidly reveal previously unidentified trophic interactions between invertebrates and thereby uncover <b>pathways</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutant</b> spread. Here, we measured concentrations of the toxic metals lead, cadmium and mercury in carabid beetle predators and their prey. Invertebrates were sampled at one control and four heavy metal-polluted sites to reveal the impact of diet composition and seasonal variation in prey availability on metal burden in carabids and metal transfer pathways through forest ecosystems. This is the first report, to our knowledge, of carabid diet composition based on PCR analysis of gut contents at the forest community level, rather than in cultivated fields. Extensive screening using group- and species-specific primers revealed that carabids ate primarily earthworms and slugs, as well as smaller numbers of woodlice and springtails. Metal concentrations in carabids correlated with seasonal changes in diet. Mercury accumulated in beetle predators more than in their slug prey. As earthworms, slugs and carabid beetles are the major prey of many birds and mammals, prey–predator transfer and associated toxicity are major risks at mercury-contaminated sites.

Additionally, we monitored isotope composition of Cu and Zn in vertical and horizontal atmospheric deposition at two sites. We compared δ 65 Cu and δ 66 Zn values in snow and rime, extracted by diluted HNO 3 and concentrated HF. Cu and Zn isotope signatures of industrial pollution sources were also determined. Cu and Zn deposition fluxes at all study sites were minute. The mean δ 65 Cu value of atmospheric deposition (− 0. 07 ‰) was higher than the mean δ 65 Cu value of pollution sources (− 1. 17 ‰). The variability in δ 65 Cu values of atmospheric deposition was lower, compared to the pollution sources. The mean δ 66 Zn value of atmospheric deposition (− 0. 09 ‰) was slightly higher than the mean δ 66 Zn value of pollution sources (− 0. 23 ‰). The variability in δ 66 Zn values of atmospheric deposition was indistinguishable from that of pollution sources. The largest isotope differences (0. 35 ‰) were observed between the insoluble and soluble fractions of atmospheric deposition.

In this work we evaluate model performance of the Weather Research and Forecast model (WRF) according to the choice of two land surface model schemes (Noah and NoahMP) and two reanalyzes data for initialization to create lateral boundary conditions (ERA-interim and ASR) to simulate surface and atmosphere dynamics including the location and displacement of the polar dome and other features characterizing atmospheric circulation associated to sea ice maxima/minima extent within the Eurasian Arctic conformed by the Nordic countries in Northern Europe and part of West Russia. Sensitivity analyses include simulations at 15 km horizontal resolution within a period of five years from 2008 to 2012. The WRF model simulations are evaluated against surface meteorological data from automated weather stations and atmospheric profiles from radiosondes.

40|$|Abstract Background The "European Environment & Health Action Plan 2004 – 2010 " {{originates}} {{from the}} concern of the European Commission on the well-being of individuals and the general population. Through this plan, the Commission has set the objectives to improve the information chain for {{a better understanding of}} the link between sources of pollution and health effects, to better identify existing knowledge gaps, and improve policy making and communication strategies. Human biomonitoring (HBM) has been included as one of the tools to achieve these objectives. As HBM directly measures the amount of a chemical substance in a person's body, taking into account often poorly understood processes such as bioaccumulation, excretion, metabolism and the integrative uptake variability through different exposure pathways, HBM data are much more relevant for risk assessment than extrapolations from chemical concentrations in soil, air, and water alone. However, HBM primarily is a stepping stone between environmental and health data, and the final aim should be an integrated and holistic systematic risk assessment paradigm where HBM serves as a pivotal point between environment and health, on the one hand leaning on environmental data to provide detailed information on the sources and <b>pathways</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> that enter the human body, and on the other hand clarifying new and existing hypotheses on the relationship between environmental pollutants and the prevalence of diseases. With the large amount of data that is being gathered in the different national survey projects, and which is expected to become available in Europe in the near future through the expected European Pilot Project on HBM, a framework to optimize data interpretation from such survey projects may greatly enhance the usefulness of HBM data for risk managers and policy makers. Results This paper outlines an hierarchic approach, based on the stepwise formulation of 4 subsequent steps, that will eventually lead to the formulation of a variety of policy relevant risk reduction options. Conclusion Although the usefulness of this approach still needs to be tested, and potential fine-tuning of the procedure may be necessary, approaching the policy implications of HBM in an objective framework will prove to be essential. </p...|$|E

After testing the model against available data, we used it to address specific questions to understand the factors that control the observed diurnal cycle of air pollution in this urban basin in the Himalayas. We studied {{the dynamics of the}} basin's nocturnal cold air pool, its dissipation in the morning, and the subsequent growth and decay of the mixed layer over the valley. During mornings, we found behavior common to large basins, with upslope flows and basin-center subsidence removing the nocturnal cold air pool. During afternoons the circulation in the Kathmandu Valley exhibited patterns common to plateaus, with cooler denser air originating over lower regions west of Kathmandu arriving through mountain passes and spreading across the basin floor, thereby reducing the mixed layer depth. We also examined the <b>pathways</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutant</b> ventilation out <b>of</b> the valley. The bulk of the pollution ventilation takes place during the afternoon, when strong westerly winds blow in through the western passes of the valley, and the pollutants are rapidly carried out through passes on the east and south sides of the valley. In the evening, pollutants first accumulate near the surface, but then are lifted slightly when katabatic flows converge underneath. The elevated polluted layers are mixed back down in the morning, contributing to the morning pollution peak.

40|$|Recent {{researches}} on {{the effects}} of environmental degradation on food security suggest that {{a better understanding of the}} relationship between agricultural intensification and pollutant transfer is urgently required to support the implementation of sustainable agricultural policies, globally. Poor understanding of the hydrological behaviour of clay-rich soils in intensively managed agricultural regions is highlighted as an important problem. The study therefore evaluated precipitation-soil water chemistry relationships, soil variability and concentration-discharge relationships at the farm-scale based on datasets from the North Wyke Farm Platform between 2011 and 2013. The three main hypothesis were that (1) precipitation and soil water chemistry are significantly related (2) significant relationships exists between the distribution of soil physiochemical characteristics and the managments of the fields, and that (3) hydrological behaviour of fields underlain by certain dominant soils in the study area are different from that of other fields. The basis of this work was to elucidate links between sources of pollutants and water quality, further understanding of the effect that management of the soil may have upon the quality of the water and improve understanding of the <b>pathways</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> within intensively managed landscapes. Precipitation chemistry of the study area was chemically different from that of the other regions in the United Kingdom, and was influenced by contributions from sea salts and terrestrial dusts. The soil chemistry was rich in organic matter which contributed significantly (r 2 > 0. 60; p< 0. 05) to the distribution of total carbon and total nitrogen in the fields. Mean total carbon and nitrogen stocks ranged 32. 4 - 54. 1 t C ha- 1, and 4 - 6. 2 t Na ha- 1, respectively in the entire farm platform while runoff coefficient at four selected fields (Pecketsford, Burrows, Middle and Higher Wyke Moor, and Longlands East) varied between 0. 1 and 0. 28 in January and November, 2013. The study rejected the first and third hypotheses, and concluded that the study area is largely influenced by contributions from the surface runoff mechanisms. The study also noted that sodium and chloride ions were dominant in the precipitation chemistry, and therefore suggests their further investigation as conservative tracers in the soil and runoff chemistry.

40|$|Abstract: Background The "European Environment & Health Action Plan 20042010 " {{originates}} {{from the}} concern of the European Commission on the well-being of individuals and the general population. Through this plan, the Commission has set the objectives to improve the information chain for {{a better understanding of}} the link between sources of pollution and health effects, to better identify existing knowledge gaps, and improve policy making and communication strategies. Human biomonitoring (HBM) has been included as one of the tools to achieve these objectives. As HBM directly measures the amount of a chemical substance in a person's body, taking into account often poorly understood processes such as bioaccumulation, excretion, metabolism and the integrative uptake variability through different exposure pathways, HBM data are much more relevant for risk assessment than extrapolations from chemical concentrations in soil, air, and water alone. However, HBM primarily is a stepping stone between environmental and health data, and the final aim should be an integrated and holistic systematic risk assessment paradigm where HBM serves as a pivotal point between environment and health, on the one hand leaning on environmental data to provide detailed information on the sources and <b>pathways</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> that enter the human body, and on the other hand clarifying new and existing hypotheses on the relationship between environmental pollutants and the prevalence of diseases. With the large amount of data that is being gathered in the different national survey projects, and which is expected to become available in Europe in the near future through the expected European Pilot Project on HBM, a framework to optimize data interpretation from such survey projects may greatly enhance the usefulness of HBM data for risk managers and policy makers. Results This paper outlines an hierarchic approach, based on the stepwise formulation of 4 subsequent steps, that will eventually lead to the formulation of a variety of policy relevant risk reduction options. Conclusion Although the usefulness of this approach still needs to be tested, and potential fine-tuning of the procedure may be necessary, approaching the policy implications of HBM in an objective framework will prove to be essential...|$|E
40|$|Bacterial and {{sediment}} pollution is widespread in US waters, contributing {{to increases in}} human disease as well as aquatic ecosystem degradation. Identifying <b>pathways</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> from source to stream may help improve water quality management. Few {{studies have examined the}} impacts of roadside ditch networks on water resources, though ditches are ubiquitous. The goal {{of this study was to}} determine if roadside ditches are conduits for fecal indicator organisms {{and sediment}} and if land use, specifically manure amendment, affects these concentrations and loadings. Seven roadside ditches were monitored for Escherichia coli (E. coli) using ISCO(TM) automated water samplers and the Idexx Colilert(TM) system, as well as total suspended solids, pH, conductivity and flow for one year in central New York. Ditches were either adjacent to manure amended agricultural fields or predominately forested land. E. coli concentrations in ditch water samples following storms ranged from undetectable to [GREATER THAN] 241, 960 MPN/ 100 mL and frequently exceeded NYS DEC and US EPA recommendations. Overall, ditches adjacent to manure amended fields had significantly higher concentrations and loads of E. coli than forested sites, though this was dependent on the season. The concentrations were also unexpectedly high in the forested sites, with possible sources including wildlife, pets, septic wastes and livestock. Peak concentrations were observed in both summers following manure spreading with declining levels thereafter, but viable organisms were detected throughout the year. Viable E. coli were also present in ditch sediment between storm events and therefore were available for resuspension and transport. Total suspended solids concentrations reached as high as 52. 2 g L- 1 and were overall significantly higher for agricultural sites as compared to forest sites. There was a complex association between total suspended solids and E. coli concentrations. These findings gain significance when placed in the broader framework that roadside drainage networks are acting to rapidly shunt stormwater runoff to downstream drinking water supplies. As a result, recommendations to reduce pathogen transport and improve water quality should focus on reducing farm runoff, using buffer strips or constructed wetlands and improving roadside ditch management...|$|E
40|$|In {{this report}} {{the design and}} first test results are {{presented}} of the EXPECT groundwater module for transport of solutes GRRR (GRoundwater source Receptor Relationships). This model {{is one of the}} abiotic compartment modules of the EXPECT model. The EXPECT model is a tool for scenario development of environmental policy plans. It covers the <b>pathway</b> <b>of</b> environmental <b>pollutants</b> from emissions to effects on biotic and abiotic receptor systems. The GRRR model computes the transport of solutes in the groundwater compartment by means of source-receptor relationships. These relationships are derived with the National Groundwater Model (LGM) developed at LBG, RIVM. This approach results in a fast calculating model which produces results in an aggregated format. Example results illustrate the way the model works. Based on three fictious scenarios, nitrogen contents have been computed in shallow and deep groundwater layers. The conclusion was made that the model is suited to perform scenario analyses, but for extreme scenarios or for detailled calculations a research model like LGM is better suited. ...|$|R

Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) bioconcentrate in planktonic food webs and these exert a biogeochemical control on the regional and global cycling of POPs. Therefore, an important issue is {{to determine whether the}} anthropogenic chemical perturbation of the biosphere introduced by the myriad <b>of</b> organic <b>pollutants</b> present in seawater influences phytoplankton abundance and productivity. The results reported here from five sets of experiments performed in the NE Atlantic Ocean show that there is a toxic effect induced by trace levels of complex mixtures <b>of</b> organic <b>pollutants</b> on phytoplankton oceanic communities. The levels <b>of</b> single <b>pollutant,</b> such as phenanthrene and pyrene, at which lethality of phytoplankton is observed are high in comparison to field levels. Complex mixtures <b>of</b> organic <b>pollutants,</b> however, have an important toxic effect on phytoplankton abundances, viability and concentrations of Chlorophyll a at pollutant concentrations 20 – 40 folds those found in the open ocean. The toxicity of these complex mixtures <b>of</b> organic <b>pollutants</b> exceeds by 103 times the toxicity expected for a single pollutant. Therefore, our results point out the need for a systematic investigation of the influence of complex mixtures <b>of</b> organic hydrophobic <b>pollutants</b> to oceanic phytoplankton communities, a perturbation not accounted for on previous assessments of anthropogenic pressures in the marine environment.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2018 - 08 Rivers play a {{large role}} in the {{transport}} of matter between ecosystems by connecting interior regions with lakes and oceans. River outflows, or plumes, constitute a significant delivery mechanism of pollutants, sediment, and nutrients to the coastal environment. Such plumes are common along the worlds coastlines, but are poorly understood and difficult to sample due to their complexity. The effects of external forcing (such as winds and waves) on river plumes is particularly understudied, but has been shown {{to play a role in}} the behavior of the plume. The Fraser River (the site of proposed and existing oil infrastructure) is a key system to understand, as its mouth is near both a major population center (Vancouver, BC) and unique coastal ecosystems. This study presents observations of plume mixing and stream-normal momentum balances in the Fraser river plume using Lagrangian surface drifters. The Strait of Georgia commonly experiences calm to moderate winds from the Southeast and strong storm winds from the Northwest in the winter, and there are differences in plume behavior between these conditions. Under SE winds, the plume thins, spreads, and turns to the right (North) upon exiting the river mouth, mixing intensely for a short period of time. This process is dominated by a balance between stream-normal pressure gradient, Coriolis, and rotational acceleration, as previous studies have shown. Under NW winds, the plume stays thicker, narrower, and flows directly across the Strait while forming a lateral front on its northern side, mixing at a slower rate for longer. Different momentum terms dominate under this wind condition: the stream- normal balance pits Coriolis and rotational acceleration pressure gradient against interfacial shear stress, wind stress, wave radiation stress gradient, and ambient current body force. The two configurations of the plume show that variable winds can have a substantial impact on the shape of the plume, which can lead to changes in the sea surface anomaly associated with the dome of freshwater exiting the river mouth. Additionally, while spreading causes the plume to mix intensely under SE winds, the net mixing under NW winds is larger due to the longer extent of the plume. This indicates that large spreading is not always necessary for substantial plume mixing. Understanding the conditions that change plume mixing and behavior is a critical step in describing the <b>pathways</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutants,</b> sediment, and nutrients as they enter the coastal ecosystem through a river plume...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} the quality of {{receiving}} waters has been continuously improved by upgrading measures on both industrial and urban waste water treatment plants (WWTP) and sewer systems. However, latest inventories of sources and <b>pathways</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> originating from industrial and domestic use and activities, for example carried out for the river Rhine catchment, {{emphasize the importance of}} diffuse nonpoint pollution on water quality in urbanized river catchments in comparison to the loads of point sources form industrial or urban WWTPs, for which a reduction on about 70 % of the status of 1985 was considered in 1995. In order to obtain detailed information on the fate of heavy metals in river catchments, this study was carried out mainly to collect representative literature about possible diffuse nonpoint pollution sources, to monitor concentration of heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Hg, Ni and Zn) in stormwater overflows and to assess these loads discharged into receiving waters. An extensive literature survey was carried out resulting in a database containing 121 references with more than 2100 values especially about the pollution sources FARMING and URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE. The database was adapted to the register on diffuse nonpoint pollution of the International Commission for the Protection of the Rhine (ICPR). While only a few references on diffuse nonpoint pollution sources were evaluated for Hg, Cr and Ni and the pathways within the urban drainage systems (e. g. effluents of stormwater retention basins, combined sewer overflows) a remarkable number of references could be collected for the other heavy metals and diffuse sources and pathways respectively. Due to the lack of precise data on {{the current state of the}} art of stormwater treatment in Germany a field study was carried out in Herrenberg. Objects of the investigation were two different stormwater retention basins (SRB) at two well defined catchments. In the field study about nine events of stormwater overflows at SRB 1 and eleven events at SRB 2 were sampled. The results (event mean concentration) indicate a high level but match the values of the evaluated references. However, specific heavy metal pollution loads referring to the impervious catchment area show high values in particular SRB 1 with its urbanized hinterland. Based on the evaluated literature database and observed EMCs in stormwater overflows a semi-empirical model has been developed to assess heavy metal loads in receiving waters from considered pollution sources.

40|$|International audienceThe Seine River basin drains {{an area of}} 78 650 km² which {{accomodates}} 25 % of the French {{population and}} 30 % of its industry. Thus, it is highly impacted by anthropic activities. As such, the Seine River basin has been the place of numerous studies, mostly achieved within the PIREN-Seine research programme, aiming to quantify several groups of organic micropollutants in different environmental compartments and urban matrices. Among the monitored organic persistent pollutants, Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers (PBDEs), Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs), Phthalates (PAEs), Alkylphenols (APs) and perfluoroalkylated substances (PFAs) have been considered. These compounds originate from very contrasting sources in the environment. PAHs are mainly emitted during combustion processes such as household heating and road traffic. PBDEs were mainly used as flamme retardants in plastic and textile industries. Although PCBs are forbidden in France since 1987, they have been extensively used as electric insulators and they can still {{be found in the}} environment. Phthalates are still used nowadays as plasticizer. Finally, PFAs can be found in many daily consumers goods as waterproof textiles or non-stick coatings. Along with their diversified sources, differences in their physico-checimal properties strongly impact their environmental fate. This study aims to establish mass balances at the Seine River basin scale for these 6 groups of organic compounds. Mass balances constitute efficient tools for understanding transfer <b>pathways</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> in the environment. Databases collected by several research teams working on the Seine River basin were used for the calculations. Along with stocks in soils, most of major environmental fluxes were quantified including atmospheric fallout, erosion from soils, river exports and wastewater treatment plant discharges. A focus on urban mass balances was also carried out considering wastewater, runoff, and sewage discharges at the Paris City scale. First results show very contrasting dynamics depending on organic contaminant groups. PAHs were found to be the most abundant compounds in the soils of the Seine basin. The other contaminant stocks were smaller (PAHs > PAEs > Aps > PCBs > PBDEs > PFAs), likely due to differences in emission sources. In atmospheric fallout, Aps were found to be the most abundant compounds. AP, PAE and PAH atmospheric fallouts were homogeneous across the basin, but highest PBDE and PCB fluxes were measured on Paris City and on agricultural areas respectively. These results suggest that PBDEs present very specific sources and that agricultural soils may act as secondary sources for PCBs. The largest fluxes in the Seine River downstream Paris City were measured for Aps and PAEs and reached about 10 t. yr- 1. The lowest fluxes were observed for PBDEs and PCBs (ca. 50 kg. yr- 1). Soil erosion seems to be a predominant contributor to PAH and PCB fluxes in the Seine River. For PAEs, wastewater treatment plant discharges appears as a significant contributor. Concerning PBDEs and APs, erosion and urban discharges were approximatively proportionnal to fluxes in the river. However, so far, some sources remain unidentified or poorly quantified and futher treatment of results is required...|$|E

40|$|A {{realistic}} {{simulation of}} physical and dynamical processes in the Arctic atmosphere and its feedbacks with the surface conditions is still a challenge for state-of-the-art Arctic climate models. This is of critical importance because studies of, for example, transport <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> from middle latitudes into the Arctic rely on the skill of the model in correctly representing atmospheric circulation including the key mechanisms and <b>pathways</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutant</b> transport. In this work {{the performance of the}} Weather Research and Forecast model (WRF) with two land surface model schemes (Noah and NoahMP) and two reanalysis data sets for creation of lateral boundary conditions (ERA-interim and ASR) is evaluated focusing on meteorological surface properties and atmospheric dynamics. This includes the position and displacement of the polar dome and other features characterizing atmospheric circulation associated to sea ice maxima/minima extent within the Eurasian Arctic. The model simulations analyzed are carried out at 15 -km horizontal resolution over a period of five years (2008 to 2012). The WRF model simulations are evaluated against surface meteorological data from automated weather stations and vertical profiles from radiosondes. Results show that the model is able to reproduce the main features of the atmospheric dynamics and vertical structure of the Arctic atmosphere reasonably well. The influence of the choice of the reanalyses used as initial and lateral boundary condition and of the LSM on the model results is complex and no combination is found to be clearly superior in all variables analyzed. The model results show that a more sophisticated formulation of land surface processes does not necessarily lead to significant improvements in the model results. This suggests that other factors such as the decline of the Arctic sea ice, stratosphere-troposphere interactions, atmosphere-ocean interaction, and boundary layer processes are also highly important and can have a significant influence on the model results. The “best” configuration for simulating Arctic meteorology and processes most relevant for pollutant transport (ASR + NoahMP) is then used in a simulation with WRF including aerosols and chemistry (WRF-Chem) to simulate black carbon (BC) concentrations in and around the Arctic and to assess the role of the modeled atmospheric circulation in the simulated BC concentrations inside the Arctic domain. Results from simulations with chemistry are evaluated against aerosol optical depth from several Aeronet stations and BC concentrations and particle number concentrations from several stations from the EBAS database. The results with WRF-Chem show a strong dependency of the simulated BC concentration on the modeled meteorology and the transport <b>of</b> the <b>pollutants</b> around our domain. The results also show that biases in the modeled BC concentrations can also be related to the emission data. Significant improvements of the models and of our understanding of the impact of anthropogenic BC emissions on the Arctic strongly depends on the availability of suitable, long-term observational data of concentrations of BC and particulate matter, vertical profiles of temperature and humidity and wind...|$|R
