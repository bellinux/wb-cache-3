5|$|Asch also {{believed}} {{the relationship between}} conformity and non-conformity was {{not as simple as}} one being the opposite of the other. This was Asch's third influential idea, and he suggested that conformity and resistance might be explained by their own unique social psychological processes. Conformity, for instance, could be a function of how aware a person is that they are being influenced by the group (distortion of <b>perception),</b> <b>the</b> degree to which the person believes that the group consensus is correct (distortion of judgement), and how badly the person wants to be accepted by the group (distortion of action). Although these exact terms have not been directly ported over to the literature, researchers such as Moscovici and Nemeth have adopted the perspective that majority and minority influence are moderated by multiple processes (Levine, 1999).|$|E
5|$|Following The Red Sea Sharks (1958) and {{its large}} number of characters, Tintin in Tibet differs from other stories in the series in that it {{features}} only a few familiar characters and is also Hergé's only adventure not to pit Tintin against an antagonist. Themes in Hergé's story include extrasensory <b>perception,</b> <b>the</b> mysticism of Tibetan Buddhism, and friendship. Tintin in Tibet has been translated into 32 languages, is highly regarded by critics, and has been praised by the Dalai Lama, who awarded it the Light of Truth Award. The story was a commercial success and was published in book form by Casterman shortly after its conclusion; the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. Tintin in Tibet was adapted for television, radio, documentary, theatre, and a video game, and {{has been the subject}} of a museum exhibition.|$|E

40|$|Researchers in {{consumer}} {{and social psychology}} have developed various theories to account for shifts in perceptions of targets caused by contextual stimuli. In this previous work, <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> shift of a target stimulus is observed as it reacts to the presentation of contextual stimuli. Attention in the past research has focused entirely on the target. As a result, no one has investigated possible shifts in perceptions of contextual stimuli. The present research proposes and tests a reciprocity hypothesis to explain {{what happens to the}} contextual stimulus and suggests that not only is <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> of <b>the</b> target shifted by the contextual stimulus, but also <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> of <b>the</b> contextual stimulus is shifted in a direction opposite to <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> shift of <b>the</b> target. That is, <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> of <b>the</b> contextual stimulus might be shifted away from the target in a contrast condition, but toward the target in an assimilation condition. ^ Two studies with 390 undergraduates examined the hypothesis that, after priming, <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> of <b>the</b> contextual stimulus might be shifted in a direction opposite to <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> shift of <b>the</b> target. In Study 1, <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> shift of <b>the</b> contextual stimulus was examined when the contextual stimulus was manipulated to produce a contrast effect on <b>the</b> target (<b>the</b> <b>perception</b> of <b>the</b> target was shifted away from the contextual stimulus). The result showed that <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> of <b>the</b> contextual stimulus was shifted away from the target as well. In Study 2, <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> shift of <b>the</b> contextual stimulus was examined when the contextual stimulus was manipulated to produce an assimilation effect on <b>the</b> target (<b>the</b> <b>perception</b> of <b>the</b> target was shifted toward the contextual stimulus). The result showed that <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> of <b>the</b> contextual stimulus was shifted toward the target. That was, results in both studies supported the predictions. Thus, after the priming procedure, <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> of <b>the</b> contextual stimulus might be shifted in a direction opposite to <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> shift of <b>the</b> target (symmetrical <b>perception</b> shift). ...|$|R

5|$|The {{disagreement}} between Jackson and Raw during the Battle of Long Tan had long-term {{effects on the}} structure of the Australian Defence Force. Raw's initial refusal to commit helicopters contributed {{to the development of a}} long-lasting perception among some Army officers that the RAAF was reluctant to support their service in battle. Some members of the Army also wrongly believed that RAAF pilots had refused to conduct the supply mission, and only did so after the squadron was threatened with being withdrawn from South Vietnam and they were spoken to forcefully by Raw. Influenced by this <b>perception,</b> <b>the</b> Army subsequently advocated for the RAAF's battlefield helicopters to be transferred to its control, and this finally occurred in the late 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Within {{minutes of}} systemin <b>perception,</b> <b>the</b> cytosolic Ca2+ {{concentration}} increases, and linolenic acid is released from cell membranes after a phospholipase has been activated. Linolenic acid is then converted to jasmonic acid via the octadecanoid pathway and jasmonic acid activates defensive genes. Production of methyl jasmonate is induced by systemins and also upregulates systemin precursor genes creating a feedback loop, amplifying the defensive signal. Methyl jasmonate is volatile and can therefore activate {{systemic acquired resistance}} in neighbouring plants, preparing their defences for attack. These signalling events are analogous to the cytokine-mediated inflammatory immune response in animals. When the inflammatory response is activated in animals, MAPKs are activated which in turn activate phospholipases. Lipids in the membrane are converted to arachidonic acid and then to prostaglandins, which are analogs of jasmonic acid. Both pathways can be inhibited by suramin.|$|E

5|$|Both sides {{sought the}} decisive engagement, {{for which they}} had amassed, {{according}} to some estimates, between 70 and 90 percent of all galleys in existence in the Mediterranean at the time. The fleets were roughly balanced: the Ottoman fleet was larger with 300 ships to the 200 Christian ones, but the Christian ships were sturdier; both fleets carried some 30,000 troops, and while the Christians had twice as many cannons, the Ottomans compensated by a large and skilled corps of archers. On 7 October, the two fleets engaged in a battle off Lepanto, {{which resulted in a}} crushing victory for the Christian fleet, while the Ottoman fleet was effectively destroyed, losing some 25,000–35,000 men in addition to some 12,000 Christian galley slaves who were freed. In popular <b>perception,</b> <b>the</b> battle itself became {{known as one of the}} decisive turning points in the long Ottoman-Christian struggle, as it ended the Ottoman naval hegemony established after the Battle of Preveza in 1538. Its immediate results however were minimal: the harsh winter that followed precluded any offensive actions on behalf of the Holy League, while the Ottomans used the respite to hurriedly rebuild their naval strength. At the same time, Venice suffered losses in Dalmatia, where the Ottomans attacked Venetian possessions: the island of Hvar was raided by the Ottoman fleet, with the Turkish forces burning down the towns of Hvar, Stari Grad and Vrboska.|$|E

25|$|The direct realist {{theory of}} speech {{perception}} (mostly associated with Carol Fowler) {{is a part}} of the more general theory of direct realism, which postulates that perception allows us to have direct awareness of the world because it involves direct recovery of the distal source of the event that is perceived. For speech <b>perception,</b> <b>the</b> theory asserts that the objects of perception are actual vocal tract movements, or gestures, and not abstract phonemes or (as in the Motor Theory) events that are causally antecedent to these movements, i.e. intended gestures. Listeners perceive gestures not by means of a specialized decoder (as in the Motor Theory) but because information in the acoustic signal specifies the gestures that form it. By claiming that the actual articulatory gestures that produce different speech sounds are themselves the units of speech <b>perception,</b> <b>the</b> theory bypasses the problem of lack of invariance.|$|E
