The revolution was fuelled {{in large part by}} Paris fashions, especially the crinoline, which demanded enormous quantities of silk, satin, velour, cashmere, <b>percale,</b> mohair, ribbons, lace and other fabrics and decorations. Before the Second Empire, clothing and luxury shops were small and catered to a very small clientele; their windows were covered with shutters or curtains. Any who entered had to explain their presence to the clerks, and prices were never posted; customers had to ask for them.|$|E

So complete was his absorption in this task that Janet, although she had resented the insinuating pressure of his former attitude toward her, felt a paradoxical sensation of jealousy. Presently, without looking up, he told her to call up the Boston office and ask for Mr. Fraile, the cotton buyer; and she learned from the talk over the telephone though it was mostly about [...] "futures"--that Ditmar had lingered for a conference in Boston on his way back from New York. Afterwards, having dictated two telegrams which she wrote out on her machine, {{he leaned back in his}} chair; and though the business for the day was ended, showed a desire to detain her.

60|$|It is a grievous heresy that {{aviation}} is {{most romantic}} when the aviator {{is portrayed as}} a young god of noble rank and a collar high and spotless, carelessly driving a transatlantic machine of perfect efficiency. The real romance is that a perfectly ordinary young man, the sort of young man who cleans your car at the garage, a prosaically real young man wearing overalls faded to a thin blue, splitting his infinitives, and frequently having for idol a bouncing ingénue, should, in a rickety structure of wood and <b>percale,</b> be able to soar miles {{in the air and}} fulfil the dream of all the creeping ages.|$|E

He described them as ornamented with a number of tails of the smaller wild beasts, with fringes, ribbons, little bells, and shells and balls, jingling and flirting about the performers' legs and arms. The women, one onlooker reported, wore, each according to her means, the newest fashions in silk, gauze, muslin, and <b>percale</b> dresses. The males covered themselves in oriental and Indian dress and covered themselves only with a sash of the same sort wrapped around the body. Except for that, they went naked.|$|E

Shortly after, and production of <b>percale</b> fabric began (New Bedford is known to be the first city in the United States to make fine cotton). In 1880, the Wamsutta Mills replaced the old Whitin spindles with 20,000 new Rabeth spindles, which were made in Pawtucket, Rhode Island by the Fales and Jenks Machine Company.

50|$|Prior to the Great Depression, in the 1920s, {{the city}} of New Bedford, {{along with many other}} {{northern}} textile towns had their own depression. During this time, four of the city's factories closed down. The following decade almost two dozen closed. Wamsutta, however, increased its sales in 1925 while others were liquidating and closing. By 1935, their sheets were henceforth known as Supercale instead of <b>percale.</b> Additionally, they manufactured a new product called Lustercale, a blend of 60% cotton and 40% high strength Avril rayon. This blend feels like cotton but is somewhat softer. At some point Wamsutta changed the fiber content of Lustercale to 100% cotton. They also created the perfect weave for sails on sailing ships. Furthermore, because of the wars, they created tailored their products for hot air balloons, gas mask fabric, military uniforms, and supplies. Many other fabric types were created for many other purposes and to this day Wamsutta remains a household name for fabrics.|$|E

5000|$|In 1946 Marcel Boussac, a {{successful}} entrepreneur {{known as the}} richest man in France, invited Dior to design for Philippe et Gaston, a Paris fashion house launched in 1925. Dior refused, wishing to make a fresh start under his own name rather than reviving an old brand. On 8 December 1946, with Boussac's backing, Dior founded his fashion house. The actual name of the line of his first collection, presented on 12 February 1947, was Corolle (literally the botanical term corolla or circlet of flower petals in English), but the phrase New Look was coined for it by Carmel Snow, the editor-in-chief of Harper's Bazaar. Dior's designs were more voluptuous than the boxy, fabric-conserving shapes of the recent World War II styles, influenced by the rations on fabric. He was a master at creating shapes and silhouettes; Dior is quoted as saying [...] "I have designed flower women." [...] His look employed fabrics lined predominantly with <b>percale,</b> boned, bustier-style bodices, hip padding, wasp-waisted corsets and petticoats that made his dresses flare out from the waist, giving his models a very curvaceous form.|$|E
5000|$|The {{quality of}} bed sheets is often {{conveyed}} by the thread count—the {{number of threads}} per square inch of material. In general, the higher the thread count, the softer the sheet, but the weave and type of thread may affect the [...] "hand" [...] of the material so that a sheet with a lower thread count may actually be softer than one with a higher count. Yarn quality also plays {{a part in the}} look and feel of sheets, as finer yarns tend to create a finer sheet fabric. The ply also plays a role in how heavy the sheet feels. Ply represents how many fibers are twisted together as the sheet is being created. A 2 ply 300 thread count sheet will feel heavier than a single ply 600 thread count sheet. [...] The most common constructions are muslin, <b>percale,</b> sateen, flannel, and knitted jersey. In a plain weave the warp and weft cross each other one at a time, and sateen, has multiple threads (usually three or four) over, and one under.|$|E
50|$|On 24 May 1774, {{two weeks}} after the death of Louis XV, her husband gave her an estate, the Petit Trianon, and free rein to {{renovate}} it; soon rumours circulated that she plastered the walls with gold and diamonds.The queen spent heavily on fashion, luxuries and gambling, though the country was facing a grave financial crisis and the population was suffering.

5000|$|Thread {{count is}} often used {{as a measure of}} fabric quality, so that [...] "standard" [...] cotton thread counts are around 150 while good-quality sheets start at 180 and a count of 200 or higher is {{considered}} <b>percale.</b> Some, but not all, of the extremely high thread counts (typically over 500) tend to be misleading as they usually count the individual threads in [...] "plied" [...] yarns (a yarn that is made by twisting together multiple finer threads). For marketing purposes, a fabric with 250 two-ply yarns in both the vertical and horizontal direction could have the component threads counted to a 1000 thread count although [...] "according to the National Textile Association (NTA), which cites the international standards group ASTM, accepted industry practice is to count each thread as one, even threads spun as two- or three-ply yarn. The Federal Trade Commission in an August 2005 letter to NTA agreed that consumers 'could be deceived or misled' by inflated thread counts. In 2002, ASTM proposed a definition for [...] "thread count" [...] that has been called [...] "the industry's first formal definition for thread count". A minority on the ASTM committee argued for the higher yarn count number obtained by counting each single yarn in a plied yarn and cited as authority the provision relating to woven fabric in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, which states each ply should be counted as one using the [...] "average yarn number." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Percale</b> was {{originally}} imported from India in the 17th and 18th centuries, then manufactured in France. The word may originate from the Persian pargālah, meaning rag, although the Oxford English Dictionary (as of December 2005) has traced it {{only as far}} as 18th-century French. The dictionary of the Institut d'Estudis Catalans describes pexal and perxal as some kind of silk fabric in the year 1348 in Valencia. The etymological dictionary of Catalan explains perxal as derived from Perche in France. In the year 1322 in Dalmatia, which had trade connections also as the Republic of Venice, Peter de genere Percal was mentioned. This word Percal, which occurred {{the first time in a}} Supreme Court verdict on Latin in 1322 in Dalmatia, derived from the Hebrew word פרקליט (prklyt), which derived from the Ancient Greek word παράκλητος (parákletos), which means lawyer. The relationship between bedding and law in ancient Persia can be guessed, because according to Phanias of Eresus, Artaxerxes I of Persia had given to Themistocles the city of Percote with bedding for his house. Taking into account the different spellings of this [...] "generatio Percal" [...] due to the variations Parkly and Perkly in Dalmatia, the name of a farm near Linlithgow Palace in Scotland, which had been built in the 14th century by a 1st cousin of the grandmother of this Peter de genere Percal, was mentioned in 1431 also as Parkly. This farm was also mentioned as Parkle (1431), Perkley (1432), Parcle (1438), Perkle (1439), Parklye (1440), Parklee (1489), Perklee (1490/91), Parklie (1528), Pairklie (1638), Pairkly (1647) and Parkly (1648) since then and it is mentioned as Parkley since 1671.|$|E

A survey was made and a representative sample of sheets was selected for testing. The sample consisted of white and gold colored cotton and cotton blend sheets in muslin and <b>percale.</b> Physical characteristics were checked. Each sheet was divided and portions subjected to laundry treatment, abrasion on the Taber Abraser, or abrasion in the Accelerator.

40|$|Women of the World War II {{home front}} {{adjusted}} to war related fabric shortages and rationing {{through the use}} of ingenious alternatives. While yard goods were subject to war rationing, and ready to wear garments were redesigned to use less fabric, a segment of the American population took advantage of another option. These families continued to create a number of attractive garments and household items throughout the war from a type of cotton <b>percale</b> which was available for free and classified as an unrestricted industrial good. The cotton commodity bag or cotton feed sack, gained popularity as an alternative to traditional yard goods throughout rural communities. This tradition began {{at the turn of the}} 20 th century and continued to grow with the support of grain manufacturers and the Department of Agriculture, which published a number of pattern booklets designed specifically for commodity bags. Three 100 lbs sacks of grain could make an average sized adult dress and packaging companies hired notable fabric designers from Europe and New York City to create colorful dress prints for their cotton packaging. This tradition continued into the 1960 s, bolstered by the annual industry sponsored Cotton Bag Sewing Queen contest. The contest was held at state fairs nationwide throughout the 1950 s and 1960 s to maintain consumer interest in the cotton bag at a time when the paper commodity bag began to grow in popularity with manufacturers...|$|E

The project interprets Vladimir Nabokov’s famous class taught at Cornell University, New York State, ‘Literature 311 - 312 : Masters of European Fiction’. Wylde focused on Nabokov’s pedagogic approach to Franz Kafka’s The Metamorphosis. The video work highlighted Wylde’s exploratory approaches to ‘processes of performative assemblage(s) ’, Wylde’s term articulating super-disciplinary foci including linguistics, philosophies, gender studies, social theories and art practices. Such approaches draw attention to accumulation, arrangement, movement, and that which is improvisatory, multi-modal or otherwise unpredictable., The work includes live actions for the camera and ‘recycling’ of image, text and audio data through methods of appropriative processes., Following two of Nabokov's questions on Kafka’s work, the project deconstructs, bothers and re-positions any hermetic hermeneutic by appropriating material from Wikipedia factualities and Google image searches. These online operations were disrupted with inappropriate of grammatically incorrect text input generative of aberrant juxtapositions, imagery and sound effects. The machine translation service, Google Translate, was used to dislocate text from one language into another. These ‘incorrect’ activities privilege modes of contingency, multiplicity and overlap to recover online image, sound and text data used to hybridise postproduction filters, transitions & generators.
