25|$|Laurence Krieg, a young fan, {{wrote to}} Lewis, {{asking him to}} {{adjudicate}} between his views of the correct sequence of reading the novels – according to the sequence of events, with The Magician's Nephew being placed first – {{and that of his}} mother, who thought the order of publication was more appropriate. Lewis wrote back, appearing to support the younger Krieg's views, although he did point out that the views of the author {{may not be the best}} guidance, and that <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not matter what order they were read in.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not entirely}} clear why they built the Ogmore Valley as a {{standard}} gauge railway in a broad gauge area, forcing the decision to build a dock at considerable expense. It may have been unavoidable owing to the Gauge Act of 1846. If so then <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have been cheaper to build the line as dual gauge from the start instead of building a dock. Perhaps even this was not permissible. The Llynvi Valley Railway was formed in 1861 by reopening pre-1846 lines. This is probably why it was permitted to use broad gauge. What {{is clear is that}} Brogdens sold off the Ulverston and Lancaster {{at about the same time}} as they started the Ogmore Valley Railway.|$|E
25|$|Such a {{phenomenon}} was observed, but not photographed, in the Owens Valley of California. Early {{in the morning}} with no wind, thin clouds were observed to form above the valley. The distinction was that they were created alternately and moved in opposite directions away from a central location on the valley floor, suggesting the existence of an inaudible free convection whistle. The reason for including this type of whistle is that we tend to think that it is necessary for a forced jet flow to encounter a solid material to create a whistle. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be more correct to generalize the concept to a particular impedance mismatch rather than a solid object. The Hartmann whistle and the jet screech fits into this generalization. The concept also applies to any fluid motion as opposed to a strictly forced flow.|$|E

500|$|While McKellen {{had made}} his sexual {{orientation}} known to fellow actors early on in his stage career, {{it was not until}} 1988 that he came out to the general public, in a programme on BBC Radio. The context that prompted McKellen's decision– overriding any concerns about a possible negative effect on his career– was that the controversial Section 28 of the Local Government Bill, known simply as Section 28, was then under consideration in the British Parliament. Section 28 proposed prohibiting local authorities from promoting homosexuality [...] "... as a kind of pretended family relationship". McKellen became active in fighting the proposed law, and, during a BBC Radio 3 programme where he debated Section 28 with the conservative journalist Peregrine Worsthorne, declared himself gay. McKellen has stated that he was influenced in his decision by the advice and support of his friends, among them noted gay author Armistead Maupin. In a 1998 interview that discusses the 29th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, McKellen commented, I have many regrets about not having come out earlier, but one of them might be that I didn't engage myself in the politicking. He has said of this period: My own participating in that campaign was a focus for people [...] take comfort that if Ian McKellen was on board for this, <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be all right for other people to be as well, gay and straight. Section 28 was, however, enacted and remained on the statute books until 2000 in Scotland and 2003 in England and Wales. Section 28 never applied in Northern Ireland.|$|E

[...] His hope was, as the series started to wind down, that <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be time to actually get to do parts two and three.|$|E

2500|$|Turing {{makes no}} comment about how machine D goes about its work. For sake of argument, we suppose that D would first {{look to see}} if the string of symbols is [...] "well-formed" [...] (i.e. {{in the form of an}} {{algorithm}} and not just a scramble of symbols), and if not then discard it. Then it would go “circle-hunting”. To do this <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> use “heuristics” (tricks: taught or learned). For purposes of the proof, these details are not important.|$|E
2500|$|Apuleius used a Latin {{style that}} {{registered}} as elocutio novella ("new speech") to his literary contemporaries. This style expressed the every day language {{used by the}} educated, along with naturally embedded archaisms. It worked to transform the more formal, classical grammar once favored since Cicero (106–43 BC). To rhetoricians <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be asiatic as opposed to attic style. Also new speech pointed toward the future development of modern Romance languages. Some suggest a style source in Africa, [...] "owing its rich colours to the Punic element... his Madauran origins"; yet, while calling Africa informative, Lindsay declares it insufficient: ...|$|E
2500|$|Critics of Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar differ greatly {{on their}} views of Caesar and Brutus. Many have debated whether Caesar or Brutus is the protagonist of the play, because of the title character's death in Act Three, Scene One. But Caesar compares himself to the Northern Star, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be foolish not to {{consider}} him as the axial character of the play, around whom the entire story turns. Intertwined in this debate is a smattering of philosophical and psychological ideologies on republicanism and monarchism. One author, Robert C. Reynolds, devotes attention to the names or epithets given to both Brutus and Caesar in his essay [...] "Ironic Epithet in Julius Caesar". This author points out that Casca praises Brutus at face value, but then inadvertently compares him to a disreputable joke of a man by calling him an alchemist, [...] "Oh, he sits high in all the people's hearts,/And that which would appear offence in us/ His countenance, like richest alchemy,/ Will change to virtue and to worthiness" [...] (I.iii.158-60). Reynolds also talks about Caesar and his [...] "Colossus" [...] epithet, which he points out has its obvious connotations of power and manliness, but also lesser known connotations of an outward glorious front and inward chaos.|$|E

2500|$|Outside of patch notes, Hello Games had {{effectively}} gone {{silent on}} social media right after the game's release up until {{the announcement of the}} Foundation update in late November 2016. Murray, who used the Hello Games' Twitter account with some frequency before release, had not been visible online for the first two months following the game's release. In the announcement of this update, Hello Games admitted to being [...] "quiet" [...] but have been paying attention to the various criticisms levelled at the game. [...] Schreier from Kotaku and Ben Kuchera of Polygon commented that some of the negative player reaction was {{due to a lack of}} clarification on these apparently missing features from either Hello Games or Sony in the weeks just after release, with Kuchera further stating that with the silence from either company, [...] "the loudest, most negative voices are shouting unopposed" [...] and leading to a strong negative perception of the game. Kuchera later wrote that many of the issues in the lead-up and follow-up to No Man's Skys release, whether by choice or happenstance, provide many lessons on the importance of proper public relations. Kuchera specifically pointed to the decision to withhold review copies and an apparent lack of public relations (PR) to manage statements relating to what features would be in the game. Kuchera also noted that many people had taken the hype generated by the press only to be disappointed by the final game, and that consumers did have ways to evaluate the game following its release before they purchased the title. Sony president Shuhei Yoshida admitted that Hello Games did not have [...] "a great PR strategy" [...] for No Man's Sky, in part for lacking a dedicated PR staff to manage expectations, but still support the developers as they continue to patch and update the game. Jesse Signal, writing for the Boston Globe noted that some of the hype for No Man's Sky may be attributed to game journalists themselves for getting too excited about the game, positing [...] "Had journalists asked certain questions at certain times, <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have been more difficult for Hello Games to make promises it couldn’t deliver on." ...|$|E
