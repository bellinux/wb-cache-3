50|$|In Persia (now Iran) {{they met}} German aviator Elly Beinhorn, who was {{grounded}} by mechanical problems. They assisted {{her and then}} worked out shared itineraries. Later, Halliburton wrote a foreword to her book Flying Girl about these and other of her adventures in the air. Now exhausted, and their <b>plane</b> <b>tiring,</b> Stephens and Halliburton continued their eastward journey. In Persia, Crown Princess Mahin Banu had a ride in the airplane. In neighbouring Iraq, the young Crown Prince Ghazi had a ride; they flew him over his school yard.|$|R
50|$|The P-51s then {{proceeded}} to shoot at the airplane, making the aircraft's crew attempt an emergency landing at El Trompillo Airport. As the plane descended, the crew dived in a final try at getting the P-51's to desist in their chase, causing one pilot, Bolivian Air Force Captain Alberto Peredo Céspedes, to crash to his death. The Constellation itself landed safely at El Trompillo, and the crew members were arrested on site. The <b>plane's</b> <b>tires</b> were blown up and the local military airline, TAM, flew soldiers in from Cochabamba to prevent the airport from being overtaken by guerrillas.|$|R
5000|$|Teng Bunma {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "trigger-happy tycoon" [...] following incidents where he used or brandished hand guns. In the first incident he shot out a $3000 tire of an airplane on the tarmac after complaining that he was frustrated with the airline's service. [...] "I lost my temper and control and had to shoot one of the <b>plane's</b> <b>tires.</b> I wanted to shoot more of them, {{to make sure that all}} were flat, but there were a lot of passengers surrounding the plane.". In the second incident he brandished a gun inside an airplane and demanded the crew delay takeoff until his late friends arrived.|$|R
2500|$|Roberto Escobar {{maintains}} Pablo {{fell into}} the drug business simply because other types of contraband became too dangerous to traffic. As there were no drug cartels then, {{and only a few}} drug barons, Pablo saw it as untapped territory he wished to make his own. In Peru, Pablo would buy the cocaine paste, which would then be refined in a laboratory in a two-story house in Medellín. On his first trip, Pablo bought a paltry [...] of paste in what was noted as the first step towards building his empire. At first, he smuggled the cocaine in old <b>plane</b> <b>tires,</b> and a pilot could return as much as US $500,000 per flight, dependent on the quantity smuggled.|$|R
50|$|The plane stopped {{first in}} Paris to be refuelled by British Air Ministry ground staff, {{but at the}} next stop in Lyons (and later stops), these staff did not appear, forcing Yates and the other airmen to refuel alone. The {{airfield}} at Marseilles was covered with boulders, blowing two of the <b>plane's</b> <b>tires</b> on landing, and during lunch the crew's map was stolen. They next went to Pisa, where Yates was forced to navigate based on the Leaning Tower due to the heavy cloud cover. The crew {{stayed up all night}} to overhaul the plane's engine. Cloud cover also complicated landings at Rome and Taranto, and on several occasions en route the plane nearly struck Italian mountain ranges.|$|R
50|$|The pair of them {{tried to}} repair the <b>plane,</b> its <b>tires</b> had melted to the runway and its engines were filled with sand. The brakes failed after a test flight with both men flying, and the plane crashed into a sand dune.|$|R
50|$|For aircraft, the {{transition}} is happening more slowly - tires are certified along with the airframe. A radial has less material in the sidewall, so it weighs less, runs cooler and lasts longer. For smaller <b>planes,</b> bias <b>tires</b> afford more stability at higher speeds and have stronger sidewalls.|$|R
50|$|The town then rallies, {{and more}} and more people go to work for war industries, go without luxuries to supply more materiel, and buy bonds. The next time that their company goes of to the front, they will have more <b>planes,</b> more <b>tires,</b> and better equipment, and they won't have to surrender.|$|R
5000|$|... 14 December 2005 - KKIA {{was closed}} {{for a few hours}} after an AirAsia <b>plane</b> burst a <b>tire</b> on landing. There were no {{injuries}} in the 10:30pm incident.|$|R
50|$|As {{the last}} pallet of {{ammunition}} was unloaded, {{one of the}} <b>plane's</b> <b>tires</b> was blown by a sniper's bullet, and a mortar attack bracketed the C-130. The plane, which was drawing most of the fire, was towed for a short distance, then taxied to a maintenance area. There the damaged wheel was changed while the plane remained under fire from mortars, rockets, artillery, and heavy machine guns. While the wheel was being changed, Dallman agreed to fly an out-of-commission bulldozer back to Da Nang Air Base. As the aircraft positioned for takeoff, one engine, which had ingested debris from an exploding mortar round, quit. The 20,000-pound bulldozer had to be unloaded. Dallman left the plane to get permission to attempt a three-engine takeoff, but the crew {{managed to get the}} fourth engine started. The plane was hit again as it took off, but without serious damage. Dallman and his crew saved a valuable transport plane, delivered a load of ammunition to the surrounded Marines, and prevented major damage to a battered outpost. For dealing heroically with a series of crises that day, Dallman was awarded the Air Force Cross, the first tactical airlift crewman to be so honored.|$|R
50|$|In (automotive) vehicle dynamics, slip is the {{relative}} motion between a tire {{and the road}} surface it is moving on. This slip can be generated either by the tire's rotational speed being greater or less than the free-rolling speed (usually described as percent slip), or by the <b>tire's</b> <b>plane</b> of rotation being {{at an angle to}} its direction of motion (referred to as slip angle).|$|R
50|$|A tire can {{generate}} horizontal force where it meets the road surface by {{the mechanism of}} slip. That force is represented in the diagram by the vector F. Note that in this example F is perpendicular to the <b>plane</b> of the <b>tire.</b> That is because the tire is rolling freely, with no torque applied to it by the vehicle's brakes or drive train. However, that {{is not always the}} case.|$|R
5000|$|When a <b>plane</b> lands, the <b>tires</b> are not spinning. The time {{it takes}} for the tires to get up to speed is {{referred}} to as [...] "spin up time" [...] (Speidel, 2002). During this time the tires are effectively dragging on the runway as well as being put under pressure by the weight of the airplane. This {{can be seen in the}} slight puff of smoke that comes from a landing aircraft's tires as they first touch the runway surface. The friction built up causes the rubber to polymerize and harden to the runway surface.|$|R
50|$|Camber angle {{alters the}} {{handling}} qualities {{of a particular}} suspension design; in particular, negative camber improves grip when cornering. This is because it places the tire at a better angle to the road, transmitting the forces through the vertical <b>plane</b> of the <b>tire</b> rather than through a shear force across it. Another reason for negative camber is that a rubber tire tends to roll on itself while cornering. The inside edge of the contact patch would begin to lift off of the ground if the tire had zero camber, reducing {{the area of the}} contact patch. This effect is compensated for by applying negative camber, maximizing the contact patch area. Note that this is only true for the outside tire during the turn; the inside tire would benefit most from positive camber.|$|R
40|$|Tire {{properties}} play {{an important}} role in two-wheeled vehicle dynamics. Hence, tire properties have to be measured both to compare objectively the performances of different tires and to develop tire models that are necessary for multi-body simulation. The measurement of motorcycle tires requires particular testing facilities because the camber angle (which is the angle between the symmetry <b>plane</b> of the <b>tire</b> and the <b>plane</b> perpendicular to the road surface) reaches large values (> 50 °) and has a large influence on the forces and torques exerted by the road on the tire. In particular in many actual conditions the lateral force due to camber (camber force) may be larger than the sideslip force. The component of the yaw moment due to camber (twisting torque) does not tend to align and in many conditions may be larger than the self-aligning moment due to tire trail...|$|R
50|$|Eric {{returns to}} the site of the plane crash and has {{frightening}} memories about it. Meanwhile, it is shown that Shannon is now the only one attending the session and she runs into Claire after seeing a mysterious couple outside the building. Eric runs into them and Claire takes them back to her apartment for the night. Eric then becomes convinced that he didn't survive the crash and attempts to commit suicide by standing in front of a train. When it seemingly fails, he angrily tells Claire to leave him alone. Distressed, she returns home only to find that Shannon has disappeared. Her neighbor tells her that she left with a man and woman, shocking Claire. She then goes to see her supervisor who is convinced she is just latched on to some elaborate theory to cover up what really happened during the crash. Frustrated, Claire returns to Emma's house where she meets Mr. Arkin. He tearfully explains the pilot of the <b>plane</b> was <b>tired</b> because he was in the middle of a divorce and he left the co-pilot to handle the plane, which resulted in the crash. However, Claire does not believe him and he leaves. She notices his briefcase has been left behind and is hysterical when she finds a ledger containing the names of the staff- the pilot is revealed to be Mr. Arkin- and passengers on the plane, including hers.|$|R
50|$|Back {{on board}} the Iron Vulture, Kit tries to escape on his airfoil again, only to be {{snatched}} up by Dumptruck and have his airfoil broken by Karnage. Karnage, furious that Kit lied to him and continues to insult him, orders Dumptruck to drop Kit out of the ship to his death, but Baloo comes to the rescue just in time, burning out his overdrive in the process. They hide under a bridge in order to deter Karnage from looking for them. Afterwards, Baloo radios Higher for Hire {{to say that they}} are coming back. In spite of Baloo's suggestions, Rebecca refuses to leave the city, and then states that she knows how to combat Karnage's lightning gun - coat the Sea Duck with an armor of rubber materials. After doing this, she joins Baloo and Kit for the ride, because they have armored the <b>plane</b> with her <b>tires.</b> When Karnage hears Baloo and Kit taunting him on his radio, he orders his men to blow them up, but just as specified, the rubberized Sea Duck is unaffected by the lightning gun. Karnage tries sending his men out in their fighter-planes to chase the Sea Duck, but they all end up getting wrecked along the way. Baloo then reluctantly rams the Sea Duck right into the lightning gun, sending it, and the stone that powers it, crashing into the bay where it explodes due to contact with water, creating a tsunami. With the pirates' primary weapon destroyed, reinforcements of Khan's air force attack them which forces them to retreat from Cape Suzette. Baloo and company wash up on shore and survive, but the Sea Duck is practically destroyed.|$|R
5000|$|Just before midnight, the plane, {{headed for}} Van Nuys, California, was racing {{down the runway}} when the {{occupants}} heard a loud bang. According to the Federal Aviation Administration, the plane was departing the airport when air traffic controllers saw sparks emanating from the plane. The pilots told the control tower that a tire had blown out {{and they would be}} aborting the take-off. Instead, the plane hurtled through the airport's fence, across a highway and crashed into an embankment. [...] "When everything stopped, I tried to get everyone I could," [...] Barker remembered. Barker and Goldstein escaped the plane and ran in circles on the highway. Hearing others yell, [...] "Stop, drop and roll," [...] Barker dropped to the ground and Goldstein helped him put out the ﬁre on his feet. [...] "I was lying next to AM as the plane was exploding, and I was screaming, 'Are we alive?'" [...] Barker and DJ AM were transported to the Joseph M. Still Burn Center in Augusta, Georgia, where they were both listed in critical condition. They were the only survivors of the crash; personal assistant Chris Baker and Che Still, along with the two pilots, had died in the crash. Less than a year later, Goldstein died from an overdose.Barker spent more than 11 weeks in hospitals and burn centers. He had 16 surgeries: blood transfusions that lasted 4-8 hours and numerous skin grafts. [...] "There were times when they were talking about amputating my foot because I didn't have enough skin on my body for my grafts," [...] he said. Barker also developed post-traumatic stress disorder, made worse by the intense guilt he felt knowing Still wasn't supposed to be on the plane. He stopped his vegetarian diet and began eating meat to increase his protein intake and possibly speed up healing of his burns. Barker recovered from the incident, enabling him to return to the recording studio in November 2008. On his first television interview since the crash, he said to MTV, [...] "I'm already playing my drums again, and I'm already back in the studio". He elaborated by stating that the return to the studio [...] "was like riding a bike. It was really exciting to know I still have my chops. It still felt good... I still can make it around the kit. Everything felt right, so I'm thankful to be able to play." [...] Barker sued the <b>plane's</b> owners, Goodyear <b>Tire</b> and Rubber Co., and an airplane maintenance company that month; the court case was settled in December 2009 and the terms of the settlement are confidential.|$|R
