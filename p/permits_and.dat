5|$|Rivers {{introduced}} legislation {{to increase taxes}} on medical marijuana. Washington {{is one of only}} a few states that has legalized marijuana for both medical and recreational use. Recreational marijuana has a 25% tax for consumers. However, medical marijuana does not have any taxes. Rivers' legislation would also force medical marijuana clinics to obtain more <b>permits</b> <b>and</b> waivers.|$|E
5|$|The {{price tag}} of the {{enormous}} structure that is becoming increasingly visible on the hilltop site above the San Diego Freeway totaled $733 million which includes $449 million for construction, $115 million for the land and site work, $30 million for fixtures and equipment, and $139 million for insurance, engineers' and architects' fees, <b>permits</b> <b>and</b> safety measures, according to Stephen D. Rountree, {{former director of the}} Getty's building program and director of operations and planning for the trust.|$|E
5|$|Tiger Woods Design {{has taken}} on two other courses, neither of which has materialized. In August 2007, Woods {{announced}} The Cliffs at High Carolina, a private course in the Blue Ridge Mountains near Asheville, North Carolina. After a groundbreaking in November 2008, the project suffered cash flow problems and suspended construction. A third course, in Punta Brava, Mexico, was announced in October 2008, but incurred delays due to issues with <b>permits</b> <b>and</b> an environmental impact study. Construction on the Punta Brava course has not yet begun.|$|E

5|$|Tubas {{has been}} {{governed by a}} {{municipal}} council since 1953, when it was granted permission {{to do so by}} Jordanian authorities who controlled the West Bank at the time. The council is made up of 15 members including the mayor, and is headquartered in the municipal hall {{in the center of the}} town. The municipality has over 60 employees. Responsibilities of the municipality include civil administration, urban planning and development, social development services, distribution of social services, the issuing of building <b>permits</b> <b>and</b> infrastructural maintenance: water, electricity and solid waste collection.|$|E
5|$|Government in the San Francisco Bay Area {{consists}} of multiple actors, including 101 city and nine county governments, a dozen regional agencies, {{and a large}} number of single-purpose special districts such as municipal utility districts and transit districts. Incorporated cities are responsible for providing police service, zoning, issuing building <b>permits,</b> <b>and</b> maintaining public streets among other duties. County governments are responsible for elections and voter registration, vital records, property assessment and records, tax collection, public health, agricultural regulations, and building inspections, among other duties. Public education is provided by independent school districts, which may be organized as elementary districts, high school districts, unified school districts combining elementary and high school grades, or community college districts, and are managed by an elected school board. A variety of special districts also exist and provide a single purpose, such as delivering public transit {{in the case of the}} Bay Area Rapid Transit District, or monitoring air quality levels in the case of the Bay Area Air Quality Management District.|$|E
5|$|Having recovered, {{the company}} worked to expand {{geographically}} into markets like Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., {{and by the}} end of 1998 reported that revenue had surpassed pre-crisis levels. Growth continued over subsequent years, in part through the $29million acquisition of Fresh Samantha, a large juice company based in Saco, Maine, in 2000. This allowed Odwalla to expand into additional East Coast markets, but incurred high transportation costs as products had to be shipped across the United States from California. To address this problem the company announced plans to build a second production facility in Palm Beach County, Florida. However, facing difficulties in obtaining building <b>permits</b> <b>and</b> allocating sufficient funds, the project was first delayed and eventually cancelled. Odwalla produced and sold products under both its own and the Fresh Samantha brand names for a few years; however, in 2003, the company decided to stop selling juice under the Fresh Samantha name and to only sell Odwalla-brand juice.|$|E

5|$|In September 1940, the Atlantic, Milos, and Pacific, {{picked up}} 3,600 Jews from Vienna, Gda≈Ñsk and Prague in Tulcea, Romania, {{to be sent}} to Palestine. The Jews that arrived in Palestine came without entry <b>permits</b> <b>and</b> were {{subsequently}} denied entry by the British government, specifically Sir Harold MacMichael, who was the High Commissioner. The British decided to deport the immigrants to either Trinidad and Tobago or Mauritius, both British colonies. On 25 November 1940, the first ship carrying the 1,800 Jews to Mauritius, the Patria, was accidentally bombed by the Haganah, who wanted the Jews to stay in Palestine. Their intentions were to cripple the ship. There were 260 fatalities and 172 injuries. There were only enough lifeboats for 805, since the capacity was 805 when the Patria was a French ship. When the British repossessed the boat, they increased the capacity to 1,800 but still had the same number of lifeboats.|$|E
5|$|In September 1968, Barthol {{left the}} band, {{just prior to}} their fourth album. His {{departure}} {{was due to the}} rest of the band's unwillingness to partake in the Festival for Life, an event established by the Youth International Party in Chicago that was intended to have the participation of several well-known musicians attract thousands of spectators for the 1968 Democratic National Convention. However, the city refused to issue any <b>permits,</b> <b>and</b> the band members, by majority vote, decided to withdraw out of fear that their equipment would be damaged. After the festival resulted in riots and violent clashes between demonstrators and the police, Barthol's conviction that Country Joe and the Fish should have held a larger role precipitated his departure from the group and move to England.|$|E
5|$|In the U.S., {{airports}} {{are required to}} obtain stormwater discharge <b>permits</b> <b>and</b> ensure that wastes from deicing operations are properly collected and treated. Large new airports {{may be required to}} collect 60 percent of aircraft deicing fluid after deicing. Airports that discharge the collected aircraft deicing fluid directly to waters of the U.S. must also meet numeric discharge requirements for chemical oxygen demand. A report in 2000 stated that ethylene glycol was becoming less popular for aircraft deicing in the U.S., due to its reporting requirements and adverse environmental impacts (p.213), and noted a shift to the use of propylene glycol (p.I-3).|$|E

5|$|On 7 March 2016 a trailer-preview was {{released}} about the History of Magic in North America {{as it is}} in the Harry Potter universe. On 7 October 2016, Rowling also released on Pottermore four pieces of writing exclusively as an introduction to the film Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, titled History of Magic in North America. It includes information about scourers in North America, brutal and violent magical mercenaries who played a significant role in the historic Salem witch trials of the 1600s, as well as info about various American wand makers; the role magic played in World War I; Native American magic; the foundation of MACUSA; the harsh enforcement No-Maj/Wizarding segregation; and life in 1920s Wizarding America; with info about wand <b>permits</b> <b>and</b> prohibition.|$|E
5|$|On April 20, 2010, an {{explosion}} destroyed an {{offshore drilling rig}} at the Macondo Prospect in the Gulf of Mexico, causing a major sustained oil leak. Obama visited the Gulf, announced a federal investigation, and formed a bipartisan commission to recommend new safety standards, after a review by Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar and concurrent Congressional hearings. He then announced a six-month moratorium on new deepwater drilling <b>permits</b> <b>and</b> leases, pending regulatory review. As multiple efforts by BP failed, some {{in the media and}} public expressed confusion and criticism over various aspects of the incident, and stated a desire for more involvement by Obama and the federal government.|$|E
5|$|On September 20, 2007, federal {{prosecutors}} charged the Jew with {{one count of}} mail fraud in connection with extorting $80,000 from Quickly. Jew denied any wrongdoing. He questioned what influence he could have over the issuing of <b>permits,</b> <b>and</b> reiterated his refusal to resign his position, despite insistence from Mayor Gavin Newsom. On November 7, 2007, {{a federal grand jury}} added five felony charges, including two counts each of bribery and mail fraud and one count of extortion. He was also accused of accepting $4,000 in cash from the owner of another local business, Wonderful Desserts and Cafe. Jew pleaded not guilty to all charges.|$|E

5|$|Originally, {{vegetables}} {{were collected}} from the wild by hunter-gatherers and entered cultivation in several parts of the world, probably during the period 10,000 BC to 7,000 BC, when a new agricultural way of life developed. At first, plants which grew locally would have been cultivated, but as time went on, trade brought exotic crops from elsewhere to add to domestic types. Nowadays, most vegetables are grown {{all over the world}} as climate <b>permits,</b> <b>and</b> crops may be cultivated in protected environments in less suitable locations. China is the largest producer of vegetables and global trade in agricultural products allows consumers to purchase vegetables grown in faraway countries. The scale of production varies from subsistence farmers supplying the needs of their family for food, to agribusinesses with vast acreages of single-product crops. Depending on the type of vegetable concerned, harvesting the crop is followed by grading, storing, processing, and marketing.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after its}} establishment, OCX decided to limit {{construction}} costs to $70million, a figure {{which is in}} addition to approximately $50million of plans, <b>permits,</b> <b>and</b> right-of-way donated by Avatar, who will not be reimbursed. Because of the cost limit, {{the decision was made}} to build a two-lane highway initially, using a design that will easily permit the road to be widened to a four- or six-lane expressway in the future. In July 2013, a design-build contract for the highway was awarded to Jr. Davis Construction Company, based in Kissimmee. The total contract amount was $69,013,443.76, representing $68,788,000.00 for the original contract and $225,443.76 for changes to the project after bidding.|$|E

5|$|When {{the first}} Black Hebrews arrived in Israel in 1969, they claimed {{citizenship}} under the Law of Return, which gives eligible Jews immediate citizenship. The Israeli government ruled in 1973 {{that the group}} did not qualify for automatic citizenship {{because they could not}} prove Jewish descent and had not undergone Orthodox conversion. The Black Hebrews were denied work <b>permits</b> <b>and</b> state benefits. The group accused the Israeli government of racist discrimination. In 1981, a group of American civil rights activists led by Bayard Rustin investigated and concluded that racism was not the cause of the Black Hebrews' situation. No official action was taken to return the Black Hebrews to the United States, but some individual members were deported for working illegally.|$|E
5|$|After {{the events}} of October 2000, the IDF {{prohibited}} Israeli access to the tomb. As a result of Operation Defensive Shield, Nablus was reoccupied by the IDF in April 2002, with severe damage to the historic core of the city, where 64 heritage buildings suffered serious damage or were destroyed. Some Breslov hasidim and others began {{to take advantage of}} the new circumstances to visit the site clandestinely under the cover of darkness, evading army and police checkpoints. Eventually Joseph‚Äôs tomb was once more open to visits. In May 2002, Israeli soldiers mistakenly opened fire on a convoy of settlers taking advantage of an ongoing incursion in Nablus to visit the tomb. Seven settlers were arrested by the army for illegally entering a combat zone. As a result of Operation Defensive Shield, the tomb was retaken by the IDF and shortly afterwards, in response to numerous requests, they renewed guarded tours of the tomb. One day every month at midnight as many as 800 visitors were allowed to pray at the gravesite. These visits were designed to prevent unauthorized and unprotected clandestine visits, mainly by Breslav Hassidim. However, in October, citing security reasons, Israel re-imposed a ban on Jewish pilgrims obtaining special <b>permits</b> <b>and</b> travelling to the tomb.|$|E
5|$|As the {{construction}} was comparatively slow {{due to a}} lack of funding, a motorway concession for the A8 and A9 motorways was granted to BINA Istra for a period of 32 years. The build-operate-transfer concession agreement mandated construction, maintenance and management of the route and its upgrade to motorway standards; this requirement included the building of dual carriageways when the annual average daily traffic (AADT) reached 10,000 vehicles per day or when the average summer daily traffic (ASDT) reached 16,000 vehicles per day. The latter was achieved in 2005 and the motorway upgrade started in 2008, even though the AADT at the time was only 8,500 vehicles. The A8 expansion was commenced by the operator, BINA Istra, immediately following a similar expansion of the A9; on the latter, the entire route was widened except for the two largest bridges, for which the expansion was postponed. The expansion of the A8 was initially limited to the Kanfanar‚ÄìRogoviƒái section because the remainder of the route required additional <b>permits</b> <b>and</b> consequently an extended preparation period. On 29 October 2011, the Kanfanar‚ÄìRogoviƒái section was upgraded to motorway standards, including four traffic lanes, and the route's designation changed from B8 to A8 (as required by legislated standards). The construction performed along the section entailed deep and long cuts requiring temporary traffic stoppages due to explosive blasting.|$|E
