5|$|The {{section of}} US-59 between I-40 and SH-9 was <b>pressed</b> <b>into</b> <b>service</b> as a detour for {{eastbound}} I-40 traffic {{after the collapse}} of its bridge over the Arkansas River on May 26, 2002.|$|E
5|$|Royal Air Force <b>pressed</b> <b>into</b> <b>service</b> two Yugoslav-built Do 17Ks which escaped Yugoslavia {{carrying}} King Peter and gold. The aircraft {{were given}} the serials AX706 and AX707. Both aircraft were destroyed in an air attack on Ismaïlia airfield on 27 August 1941.|$|E
5|$|Enlisting in the U.S. Army in 1910, Middleton {{was first}} {{assigned}} to the 29th Infantry Regiment, where {{he worked as a}} clerk. Here he did not become an infantryman as he had hoped, but he was <b>pressed</b> <b>into</b> <b>service</b> playing football, a sport strongly endorsed by the army. Following two years of enlisted service, Middleton was transferred to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where he was given the opportunity to compete for an officer's commission. Of the 300 individuals who were vying for a commission, 56 were selected, and four of them, including Middleton, would become general officers. As a new second lieutenant, Middleton was {{assigned to the}} 7th Infantry Regiment in Galveston, Texas, which was soon <b>pressed</b> <b>into</b> <b>service,</b> responding to events created by the Mexican Revolution. Middleton spent seven months doing occupation duty in the Mexican port city of Veracruz, and later was assigned to Douglas, Arizona, where his unit skirmished with some of Pancho Villa's fighters.|$|E

5|$|After having {{declined}} in size following the subjugation of the Mediterranean, the Roman navy underwent short-term upgrading and revitalisation {{in the late}} Republic to meet several new demands. Under Caesar, an invasion fleet was assembled in the English Channel to allow the invasion of Britain; under Pompey, a large fleet {{was raised in the}} Mediterranean Sea to clear the sea of Cilician pirates. During the civil war that followed, as many as a thousand ships were either constructed or <b>pressed</b> <b>into</b> <b>service</b> from Greek cities.|$|E
5|$|Ark Royal was <b>pressed</b> <b>into</b> <b>service,</b> {{delivering}} {{aircraft to}} Malta during several supply runs throughout June and July, and escorting the convoys of Operation Substance in July and Operation Halberd in September. Despite some losses, the convoys succeeded in keeping Malta supplied and fighting. The continued Allied presence in Malta was a considerable problem for Rommel in Africa, who was losing {{as much as}} ⅓ of his supplies from Italy to submarines and bombers based there. Adolf Hitler decided to send a flotilla of U-boats into the Mediterranean to attack Allied shipping, {{against the advice of}} Großadmiral Raeder.|$|E
5|$|Before the Orange Bowl, Cincinnati {{was ranked}} 50th (of 119 Division I FBS teams) in total offense. The team was ranked 24th in passing offense, {{with the five}} quarterbacks <b>pressed</b> <b>into</b> <b>service</b> during the season {{averaging}} 254.1 passing yards per game. By {{the end of the}} season, Tony Pike emerged as Cincinnati's sole starting quarterback. He finished the regular season having completed 183 of 291 pass attempts for 2,168 yards, 18 touchdowns, and 7 interceptions. He ranked second in the Big East and 29th nationally in passing efficiency with a passer rating of 141.07.|$|E

50|$|Day by day, Rokossovsky's forces became stronger. As the Smolensk pocket {{deflated}} under German pressure Rokossovsky {{was able}} to <b>press</b> <b>into</b> <b>service</b> retreating soldiers and formations that {{slipped out of the}} pocket and employed them reinforcing the perimeter of the Yartsevo corridor. Eventually, the 38th Rifle Division was handed over to Rokossovsky when Timoshenko rationalized the command of the shrinking formations in the Smolensk pocket by disbanding Ivan Konev's 19th Army.|$|R
5|$|By nightfall on 18 August, the North Korean 4th Division {{had been}} annihilated; {{huge numbers of}} deserters had {{weakened}} its numbers during the fight, but by that time, Obong-ni and Cloverleaf Hill had been retaken by the U.S. forces. Scattered groups of North Korean soldiers fled back across the Naktong, pursued by American planes and artillery fire. The next day, the remains of 4th Division had withdrawn across the river. In their hasty retreat, they left {{a large number of}} artillery pieces and equipment behind which the Americans later <b>pressed</b> <b>into</b> <b>service.</b>|$|E
5|$|Connecticut {{served as}} the {{flagship}} for the Jamestown Exposition in mid-1907, which commemorated the 300th anniversary {{of the founding of}} the Jamestown colony. She later sailed with the Great White Fleet on a circumnavigation of the Earth to showcase the US Navy's growing fleet of blue-water-capable ships. After completing her service with the Great White Fleet, Connecticut participated in several flag-waving exercises intended to protect American citizens abroad until she was <b>pressed</b> <b>into</b> <b>service</b> as a troop transport at the end of World War I to expedite the return of American Expeditionary Forces from France.|$|E
5|$|Debs {{attended}} public school, {{dropping out}} of high school at age 14. He took a job with the Vandalia Railroad cleaning grease from the trucks of freight engines for fifty cents a day. He later became a painter and car cleaner in the railroad shops. In December 1871, when a drunken locomotive fireman failed to report for work, Debs was <b>pressed</b> <b>into</b> <b>service</b> as a night fireman. He decided to remain a fireman on the run between Terre Haute and Indianapolis, earning more than a dollar a night for the next three and half years.|$|E
50|$|The United States Navy {{purchased}} {{three examples}} and designated them RS-1; these {{were joined by}} two Pan Am aircraft <b>pressed</b> <b>into</b> Navy <b>service</b> and designated RS-5.|$|R
2500|$|Many men on {{the troop}} train were killed {{as a result of}} the two collisions, but the {{disaster}} was made much worse by a subsequent fire. The great wartime traffic and a shortage of carriages meant that the railway company had to <b>press</b> <b>into</b> <b>service</b> obsolete Great Central Railway stock. These carriages had wooden bodies and frames, with very little crash resistance compared with steel-framed carriages, and were gas-lit using the Pintsch gas system.|$|R
50|$|In {{countries}} {{engaged in}} warfare, many civilian aircraft were <b>pressed</b> <b>into</b> military <b>service.</b> Some civilian operations were maintained, for example BOAC continued making overseas passenger flights, often camouflaging its aircraft.|$|R
5|$|During the World Wars, {{factories}} {{around the}} bay were <b>pressed</b> <b>into</b> <b>service</b> mass-producing {{a variety of}} products including aviation fuel, synthetic rubber, and ships. The first tin smelter outside of Europe was opened in Texas City {{becoming one of the}} world's main suppliers. The population in the Bay Area grew faster than even Houston as processing plants and factories were built and expanded. Ellington Air Force Base was built to the southeast of Houston (adjacent to modern Clear Lake City) and became a major air field and flight training center during the wars.|$|E
5|$|Men without property, {{who were}} thereby {{excluded}} from the qualifying social classes of the adsidui, were exempted from military service {{on the grounds that}} they were too poor to provide themselves with any arms whatsoever. However, in the most pressing circumstances, even these proletarii were <b>pressed</b> <b>into</b> <b>service,</b> though their military worth was probably questionable. Troops in all of these classes would fight together on the battlefield, with the exception of the most senior troops, who were expected to guard the city.|$|E
5|$|Suevic was {{launched}} on 8 December 1900, and set sail on her maiden voyage to Sydney on 23 March 1901. Shortly thereafter, Suevic and her four sisters were <b>pressed</b> <b>into</b> <b>service</b> carrying troops {{to fight in}} the Boer War in South Africa. In August 1901 she made her one and only voyage from Liverpool to New York City. Once the Boer War was over, White Star was finally able to institute regular monthly service to Australia using the Jubilee-class ships.|$|E

5|$|The Polikarpov I-5 was a single-seat biplane {{which became}} the primary Soviet fighter between its {{introduction}} in 1931 through 1936, after which it became the standard advanced trainer. Following Operation Barbarossa, which destroyed much of the Soviet Air Forces (VVS), surviving I-5s were equipped with four machine guns and bomb racks and <b>pressed</b> <b>into</b> <b>service</b> as light ground-attack aircraft and night bombers in 1941. They were retired in early 1942 as Soviet aircraft production began to recover and modern ground-attack aircraft like the Ilyushin Il-2 became available. A total of 803 built (including 3 prototypes).|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} work on Southampton's defences {{resulted in}} considerable improvements: {{by the late}} 14th century, the town was completely encircled by 2km (1.25 miles) of stone walls. Some existing buildings, including a dovecote, were reinforced and <b>pressed</b> <b>into</b> <b>service</b> {{as part of the}} defences. South Gate was built to protect the southern quays, with a wide archway, complete with parapets and machicolations. The building work proved very expensive, however, and despite the mayor and bailiffs enforcing contributions and assistance from the citizens, Parliament had to be asked several times in the 1370s to assist by remitting arrears of taxes owed by Southampton.|$|E
5|$|With the {{political}} situation in Spain relatively settled, Irving continued to closely monitor {{the development of the}} new government and the fate of Isabella. His official duties as Spanish Minister also involved negotiating American trade interests with Cuba and following the Spanish parliament's debates over slave trade. He was also <b>pressed</b> <b>into</b> <b>service</b> by the American Minister to the Court of St. James's in London, Louis McLane, to assist in negotiating the Anglo-American disagreement over the Oregon border that newly elected president James K. Polk had vowed to resolve.|$|E
50|$|BA-64E: Turretless {{armoured}} {{personnel carrier}} {{variant of the}} BA-64, capable of accommodating six passengers who debarked through a rear door. Nine prototypes were built in 1943 and later <b>pressed</b> <b>into</b> combat <b>service.</b>|$|R
50|$|On 28 August 1942, the Finns {{captured}} two Sh-2s and <b>pressed</b> them <b>into</b> <b>service</b> in {{the liaison}} role, {{as well as}} carrying the Commander of the Finnish Air Force, until 1944.|$|R
50|$|Designation for the {{prototype}} Constellation. One built. The C-69 {{was the original}} military transport version for the USAAF. All aircraft built during World War II were <b>pressed</b> <b>into</b> military <b>service</b> under this designation.|$|R
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of small vessels {{from all over the}} south of England were <b>pressed</b> <b>into</b> <b>service</b> to aid in the Dunkirk evacuation. They {{included}} speedboats, Thames vessels, car ferries, pleasure craft, and many other types of small craft. The most useful proved to be the motor lifeboats, which had a reasonably good capacity and speed. Some boats were requisitioned without the owner's knowledge or consent. Agents of the Ministry of Shipping, accompanied by a naval officer, scoured the Thames for likely looking vessels, had them checked for seaworthiness, and took them downriver to Sheerness, where naval crews were to be placed aboard. Due to shortages of personnel, many small craft crossed the Channel with civilian crews.|$|E
5|$|Another {{reform was}} that Austria, having lost many officers, veteran and elite troops, and regulars, {{and unable to}} call on allies, embraced the Levée en masse used earlier by the French. By this time, the French were moving from the Levée en masse in favour of forming a regular army based on a core of battle-hardened and elite veterans. In a strange {{reversal}} of the earlier Napoleonic Wars, where Frenchmen with little experience and often <b>pressed</b> <b>into</b> <b>service</b> fought against the professional Austrian army, a massive amount of Austrian conscripts, with no experience and only basic training and equipment would be sent into the field against a highly trained, campaign-hardened, and well-equipped French Grande Armée.|$|E
5|$|The Matoika {{had been}} {{in the service of the}} U.S. Army as a {{transport}} ship since September 1919, and, until the time of her selection, had been returning American soldiers from Europe and repatriating the remains of Americans killed during the war. Before World War I, the Matoika had been a passenger liner for North German Lloyd by the name of Princess Alice. After the United States joined the conflict in 1917, the liner had been <b>pressed</b> <b>into</b> <b>service</b> for the U.S. Navy carrying American troops to Europe; she was renamed Princess Matoika, after one of the given names for Pocahontas, as part of an order to replace Germanic names of seized ships with American names.|$|E
