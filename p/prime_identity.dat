40|$|We conduct {{more and}} more of our daily {{interactions}} over electronic media. The EC-funded project PRIME (Privacy and Identity Management for Europe) envisions that individuals will be able to interact in this information society in a secure and safe way while retaining control of their privacy. The project had set out to prove that existing privacy-enhancing technologies allow {{for the construction of a}} user-controlled identity management system that comes surprisingly close to this vision. This paper describes two key elements of the <b>PRIME</b> <b>identity</b> management systems: anonymous credentials and policy languages that fully exploit the advanced functionality offered by anonymous credentials. These two key elements enable the users to carry out transactions, e. g., over the Internet, revealing only the strictly necessary personal information. Apart from presenting for the first time these two key results, this paper also motivates the need for privacy enhancing identity management, gives concrete requirements for such a system and then describes the key principles of the <b>PRIME</b> <b>identity</b> management solution...|$|E
40|$|Priming is {{commonly}} viewed as altered subsequent target processing by preceding prime stimuli. Here, we ask how, if at all, subsequent salient targets modulate memory-trace processing of preceding primes (i. e., backward priming) accomplished {{with and without}} awareness. On a trial, participants saw a prime, a mask, and a target in succession, pressing a respective key to report <b>prime</b> <b>identity</b> (a square with or without gaps in its outline that was either congruent or incongruent with the target). In Experiments 1 and 2, prime identification was above and at chance level, respectively. With prime awareness (Experiment 1), target-prime congruency yielded reduced response times, while without prime awareness (Experiment 2), reduced error rates occurred for the congruent primes. The results show {{for the first time}} the existence of backward (retroactive) priming of the prime’s memory traces by subsequent salient targets. Moreover, the findings suggest an awareness-dependent dissociation of backward priming that engages either response processing or solely sensory representations of stimuli with discriminable and indiscriminable <b>prime</b> <b>identity,</b> respectively. Perceptual priming {{is commonly}} viewed as either enhanced or deteriorated processing o...|$|E
40|$|How does <b>priming</b> <b>identity</b> affect {{charitable}} giving? We {{show that}} individuals {{are more likely}} to donate when a facet of their identity associated with a norm of generosity is primed in an appeal. In large charitable giving field experiments run by a large national charity, appeals that <b>prime</b> an individual’s <b>identity</b> as a previous donor to the charity or {{as a member of a}} local community generate more donations. The primes are more effective when they highlight a facet of the potential donor’s identity that we hypothesize to be more relevant to his sense of self: <b>Priming</b> <b>identity</b> as a previous donor is more effective for more regular donors and <b>priming</b> <b>identity</b> as a local community member is more effective for people in smaller communities. Together, these results elucidate the impact of identity on behavior and demonstrate how <b>identity</b> <b>primes</b> can be implemented in practice to encourage public good provision...|$|R
40|$|Embryonic {{stem cells}} (ESCs) cultured in leukemia {{inhibitory}} factor (LIF) plus {{fetal bovine serum}} (FBS) exhibit heterogeneity in the expression of naive and primed transcription factors. This heterogeneity reflects the dynamic condition of ESCs and their versatility to promptly respond to signaling effectors promoting naive or primed pluripotency. Here, we report that ESCs lacking Nanog or overexpressing Otx 2 exhibit an early <b>primed</b> <b>identity</b> in LIF + FBS and fail to convert into 2 i-induced naive state. Conversely, Otx 2 -null ESCs possess naive identity features in LIF + FBS similar to Nanog-overexpressing ESCs and convert poorly into FGF-induced early primed state. When both Nanog and Otx 2 are inactivated, ESCs cultured in LIF + FBS exhibit <b>primed</b> <b>identity</b> and weakened ability to convert into naive state. These data suggest that, through mutual antagonism, NANOG and OTX 2 specify the heterogeneous identity of ESCs cultured in LIF + FBS and individually predispose them for optimal response to naive or primed inducing factors...|$|R

40|$|Semantic priming {{effects are}} popularly {{explained}} in terms of an automatic spreading activation process, according to which the activation of a node in a semantic network spreads automatically to interconnected nodes, preactivating a semantically related word. It is expected from this account that semantic priming effects should be routinely observed when the <b>prime</b> <b>identity</b> is veiled from conscious awareness, but the extant literature on masked semantic priming effects is notoriously mixed. The authors use the same prime–target pairs in the lexical decision task and the semantic categorization task and show that although masking the prime eliminates the semantic priming effect in lexical decision, reliable semantic priming effects are observed with both masked and unmasked primes in the semantic categorization task. The authors explain this task dependence in terms of their account of semantic priming effects based on notions of evidence accumulation and source confusion and support their account by means of reaction time distribution analyses. 14 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Apartheid's {{lingering}} ghost {{ensures that}} repatriation processes in South Africa are complex. Apartheid ideology not only separated black and white, but also made ethnicity the <b>prime</b> <b>identity</b> for Africans, {{many of whom}} internalised it. South Africa's ethicised past ensured {{that the process of}} repatriating Mapungubwe human remains was framed in ethnic terms. This resulted in quarrels between claimant communities, who tried to authenticate their claims by proving sole ownership of the human remains. In this potentially volatile context archaeologists were not only negotiating responsible repatriation, but also had to consider their role in a divided present, as squabbles over repatriation could harm both the dead and the living. Fluid group membership involved in the negotiation for the return of human remains from Mapungubwe meant that {{it would be difficult to}} exclude any claimants. It was therefore agreed that conflicting oral traditions should be viewed as equal, even when not supported by archaeological data. This acceptance of multivocality resulted in a joint claim by representatives of the Mapungubwe descendants. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|The {{experience}} of controlling one’s own actions, and through them {{events in the}} outside world, is a pervasive feature of human mental life. Two experiments investigated the relation between this sense of control and the internal processes involved in action selection and cognitive control. Action selection was manipulated by subliminally priming left or right keypress actions {{in response to a}} supraliminal visual target. The action caused the display of one of several colours as an action effect. The specific colour shown depended on whether the participant’s action was compatible or incompatible with the preceding subliminal prime, and not on the <b>prime</b> <b>identity</b> alone. Unlike previous studies, therefore, the primes did not predict the to-be-expected action effects. Participants rated how much control they experienced over the different colours. Replicating previous results, compatible primes facilitated responding, whereas incompatible primes interfered with response selection. Crucially, priming also modulated the sense of control over action effects: participants experienced more control over colours produced by actions that were compatible with the preceding prime than over colours associated with prime-incompatible actions. Experiment 2 showed that this effect was not solely due to priming modulating action–effect contingencies. These results suggest that sense of control is linked to processes of selection between alternative actions, being strongest when selection is smooth and uncontested...|$|E

40|$|In the United States, {{a growing}} number of young people are failing to launch into self-sufficiency, a {{characteristic}} of adulthood recognized by most cultural groups. These â??boomerang childrenâ?? return home and interrupt the life course development of their â??empty nestâ?? mothers who must suspend plans for self-development. How mothers from different socioeconomic backgrounds cope with this countertransitional phenomenon while preparing their children for successful relaunch is not well known. Elderâ??s life course paradigm provided the theoretical framework for this phenomenological study. Perceptions were collected from an ethnically diverse group of 23 empty nest mothers with 30 boomerang children and seven boomerang grandchildren from five U. S. states, recruited using criterion-based convenience sample. Data were collected through recorded telephone interviews that were transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using Saldanaâ??s codes-categories-emergent themes model. The findings revealed that boomerang children caused emotional and financial distress, a reassessment of parenting skills, and that boomerang grandchildren reinvigorated the motherâ??s <b>prime</b> <b>identity</b> as a caregiver. These findings were consistent regardless of ethnicity or socioeconomic status. This study contributes to the empirical literature by depicting the boomerang phenomenon as a shift in cultural expectations which represents a new phase in the life course development paradigm.

40|$|This article attends to the {{relationship}} between our ethnic, social and cultural identities, and the creation of the new communal identity embodied in the Christian community. Drawing upon six New Testament texts – Ephesians 2 : 11 – 22; Galatians 3 : 27 – 28, 1 Corinthians 7 : 17 – 24 and 10 : 17, 1 Peter 2 : 9 – 11 and Revelation 21 : 24 – 26 – it is argued that {{the creation of a new}} and <b>prime</b> <b>identity</b> in Christ does not abrogate other creaturely identities, even as it calls for the removal of such as boundary markers. Catholicity, in other words, is intrinsically related to the most radical particularity, and demands an ongoing work of discernment and of judgement vis-à-vis the gospel itself.

40|$|International audiencePrime stimuli {{formed by}} {{inserting}} unrelated letters {{in a given}} target word (called ``superset'' primes) provide a means to modify the relative positions of the letters shared by prime and target Here we examined the time-course of superset priming effects in an ERP study using the sandwich-priming paradigm. We compared the effects of superset primes formed by the insertion of unrelated letters (e. g., maurkdet-MARKET), or by the insertion of hyphens (e. g., ma-rk-et-MARKET), with <b>identity</b> <b>priming</b> (e. g., market-MARKET), all measured relative to unrelated control primes. Behavioral data revealed significantly greater priming in the hyphen-insert condition compared with the letter-insert condition. In the ERP signal, letter-insert priming emerged later than hyphen-insert priming and produced a reversed priming effect in the N 400 time-window compared with the more typical N 400 priming effects seen for both hyphen-insert <b>priming</b> and <b>identity</b> <b>priming.</b> The different pattern of priming effects seen for letter-insert primes and hyphen-insert primes suggests that compared with <b>identity</b> <b>priming,</b> letter superset priming reflects the joint influence of: (1) a disruption in letter position information, and (2) an inhibitory influence of mismatching letters.

Background: Failures of communication and teamwork between airline crew have been implicated in a number of airline crashes. Method: Flight attendants based domestically (n = 254) or overseas (n = 230) received a manipulation designed to prime either their social identity or personal identity and then read a brief outline of an in-flight event before completing a teamwork questionnaire. Results: Flight attendants who received a social <b>identity</b> <b>prime</b> indicated increased willingness to engage in coordinated team action compared with those who received a personal <b>identity</b> <b>prime.</b> Conclusion: <b>Priming</b> social <b>identity</b> can enhance attitudes toward teamwork and communication, potentially leading to increased willingness to engage in intergroup cooperation.

Is this achieved by a unitary all-purpose conflict control system, or do independent subsystems deal with {{different aspects of}} conflicting information? In a fully factorial hybrid prime-Simon task, participants responded to the identity of targets displayed at different nominally irrelevant screen locations, preceded by nominally irrelevant, consciously or nonconsciously perceived primes. The response required by the target's identity could match or mismatch (a) the target's location, and (b) the <b>prime's</b> <b>identity,</b> resulting in potential conflict (a) across and (b) within stimulus domains. Conflict effects were investigated within and across trials. Results suggest that (i) nonconsciously perceived information elicits within-trial control, but-unlike consciously perceived information-no across-trial behavioral modulation; (ii) separate subsystems deal with conflicts arising from different stimulus domains; and (iii) occasional apparent interactions between domains reflect a particular difficulty in reactivating a just-discarded response (reactivation aversion effect, RAE).

We examined the possibility that social identity concerns may also shape the judgment of non-social properties—namely, olfactory judgment.

Furthermore subjects 4 better-than-average bias was assessed during a post-experimental questionnaire. We find that monetary incentives as a reason to honestly self-evaluate reduce cultural differences in overplacement and in overestimation of own performance. Over-precision in probability judgment accuracy on the other hand significantly differed across ethnical groups. To analyze national <b>identity</b> <b>priming</b> effects on overconfidence, a pre-experimental questionnaire made this identity salient to a randomly selected treatment group. Previous studies found that <b>primes</b> of certain <b>identities</b> can trigger behavior that is consistent with the stereotypes associated with that identity, but can also cause psychological reactance leading to counter-stereotypical behavior. We find that in a setting where there are no incentives to provide honest performance self-evaluations the <b>identity</b> <b>prime</b> reinforces behavior consistent with a default strategy which helps adapting to social norms. In incentivized decisions on the other hand the prime causes counter-stereotypical self-perception. Reasons for this phenomenon are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Different {{combinations}} of {{forward and backward}} masking as well as interocular suppression have been used extensively to render stimuli invisible and to study those aspects of visual stimuli that are processed {{in the absence of}} conscious experience. Although the two techniques obviously differ both in their applications and mechanisms, only little effort has been made to compare them systematically. Yet, such a comparison is crucial: existing discrepancies in the extent of unconscious processing inferred from these two techniques must be reconciled, as our understanding of unconscious vision should be independent of the technique used to prevent visibility. Here, we studied similarities and differences between faces rendered invisible by masking versus interocular suppression using a priming paradigm. By carefully equating stimulus strength across the two techniques, we analyzed the effects of face primes with the same viewpoint (repetition priming, Experiment 1) and of face primes with a different viewpoint (<b>identity</b> <b>priming,</b> Experiment 2) on the reaction times for a fame categorization task. Overall, we found that the magnitude of both repetition and <b>identity</b> <b>priming</b> largely depended on stimulus visibility. Moreover, when the primes were subjectively invisible, both repetition and <b>identity</b> <b>priming</b> were found to be qualitatively stronger under masking than under interocular suppression. Taken together, these results help refine our understanding of which level of visual processing each technique disrupts, and illustrate the importance of systematic methodological comparisons in the field of unconscious vision...|$|R
