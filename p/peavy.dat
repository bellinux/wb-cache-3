5|$|On June 24, Jake <b>Peavy</b> {{surrendered}} three earned runs in five innings, {{which caused}} his ERA {{to rise from}} 1.98 to 2.14. This gave Young, who had a 2.08 ERA, the National League-leading average for one day. The next day, Brad Penny allowed only one earned run over eight innings {{to take the lead}} with a 2.04 ERA.|$|E
5|$|He {{was placed}} on the {{disabled}} list after he incurred a strained oblique muscle during the third inning of his July 24 start. On August 9, he was activated off the disabled list to make a scheduled start. He took a 12-start (five-decision) undefeated streak, dating back to a May 12 loss to the Cardinals, into his first start off the disabled list, but he took the loss in a 5–0 defeat, which was again against the Cardinals. Young ended the 2007 season as the major league leader in opponent batting average and hits per nine innings, but also in stolen bases allowed (with 44). He battled injuries late in the season and surrendered the ERA leadership to Jake <b>Peavy</b> in his August 30 start.|$|E
5|$|The score {{remained}} the same through the fourth inning. Fogg was relieved by Taylor Buchholz {{in the top of}} the fifth and, following a double by Tulowitzki, <b>Peavy</b> allowed the game-tying run to score on a Holliday single. Seth Smith, pinch hitting for the pitcher in the bottom of the sixth, hit a triple and then scored on a sacrifice fly by Matsui to give the Rockies a 6–5 lead. The Rockies' Garrett Atkins appeared to homer in the bottom of the seventh, extending the Rockies lead, but umpires ruled that the ball hit padding on the outfield wall, which was still in play, and awarded Atkins a double. Jamey Carroll pinch ran for Atkins, but no runs scored in the inning. The Rockies brought in closer Brian Fuentes {{in the top of the}} 8th, but the Padres re-tied the game when Geoff Blum singled to lead off the inning, advanced to second base on a wild pitch, and scored on a double by Brian Giles. This was Fuentes' seventh blown save of the season.|$|E

5|$|Young {{started the}} season in the second spot in the Padres {{rotation}} between ace <b>Peavy</b> and Maddux. He pitched his first three turns from the second spot in the rotation. On April 18, he missed his turn and Maddux moved into the second spot in the rotation. Young has since been pitching in the third spot in the rotation. The number three spot in the rotation {{is the only one}} that was not scheduled to start during the Padres visit to Wrigley Field May 12–15, 2008. Young, thus, did not make a start against the Cubs with whom he had an altercation in 2007. On May 21, 2008 in a game against the St. Louis Cardinals, Young was hit in the face by a line-drive from Albert Pujols. Young was sitting on the ground for several minutes but was able to leave the field under his own power as he only sustained a nasal fracture and a laceration on his nose. Later in the same inning, Pujols would also sprain the ankle of Padres catcher Josh Bard while sliding into home plate. Young returned to the mound on July 29 with five shutout innings against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Young then did not pitch between August 10 and September 1 due to another disabled list stint and returned to the lineup to take the loss in a game where Greg Maddux, who had become a Los Angeles Dodger, earned his 354th victory to tie Roger Clemens for eighth on the all-time list.|$|E

50|$|In the 2006 season, Harang led the National League in {{complete}} games with six and strikeouts with 216, surpassing Jake <b>Peavy's</b> strikeout total of 215 {{in his final}} regular season game. Harang was also the most consistent pitcher on the 2006 Reds staff. Harang was only the ninth pitcher since 1960 to lead the National League in both wins and strikeouts (it has occurred 12 times in baseball history). However, he did not receive any votes for the National League Cy Young Award (Brandon Webb won the award in 2006). All previous pitchers that led the National League in both categories have won the award.|$|R

He made his Major League Baseball debut on September 7, 2011, pitching 2 scoreless innings in relief of starter John Danks in a game the White Sox lost, 5-4, to the Minnesota Twins. Axelrod made his first Major League start a week later, on September 14 vs. the first-place Detroit Tigers, who were on an 11-game win streak. He exited after six innings with a 5-2 lead, after striking out eight Tigers. Unfortunately for Axelrod, the White Sox bullpen blew the lead in the 9th inning and he did not pick up the win.

25|$|In 2010, DC Comics sued Toberoff, Joanne Siegel, Laura Siegel Larson, and Mark Warren Peary. Jean <b>Peavy,</b> {{incapacitated}} by {{a stroke}} in 2009, was not {{listed as a}} defendant in this case. Her son, Mark Warren Peary, was substitute executor for the Shuster estate. DC {{asked the court to}} invalidate and void the Shusters' termination notice and the agreements between Toberoff's firms and the heirs of Siegel and Shuster.|$|E
25|$|The judge {{agreed with}} DC's {{argument}} that the 1992 agreement with Jean <b>Peavy,</b> the sole heir and executor to Shuster's estate, barred her and all other heirs from pursuing termination.

500|$|The game {{counted as}} a regular season game in {{baseball}} statistics. If Matt Holliday had gone 0 for 5 in the game he would have lost the batting title to Chipper Jones. However, Holliday went 2 for 6 and won the title with a batting average of [...]340. Also, Holliday's triple and run batted in (RBI) in the 13th gave him 137 RBI in total, winning the RBI crown over Ryan Howard by 1. Holliday's teammate Tulowitzki believed Holliday was the league's most valuable player, but he ultimately finished a close second to the Phillies' Jimmy Rollins in the Most Valuable Player Award voting. Also, Padres' starter Jake <b>Peavy</b> increased his earned run average (ERA) from 2.36 to 2.54 {{in the game and}} added six strikeouts to his season total. <b>Peavy</b> ultimately won the National League wins, strikeout, and ERA titles. These titles combined to give <b>Peavy</b> a pitching Triple Crown and he {{went on to win the}} Cy Young Award unanimously.

The pitch nicked Lee's left hand near his surgically repaired wrist. When the [...] Lee began walking towards first base, both he and Young, , exchanged words, and a bench-clearing altercation ensued. Both Young and Lee were ejected from the game, along with Jake <b>Peavy</b> and Cubs bench coach Gerald Perry. On June 18, Young and Lee were suspended five games each for their roles in the brawl, and Perry was suspended three games. All suspended parties were fined, as were <b>Peavy</b> and Brian Giles. Young and Lee appealed their suspensions, which were to begin the following day. At the time of the scuffle in the fourth inning, both pitchers were working on no-hitters. Young was ejected in the game, and he earned a no-decision in the game which the Padres ultimately won 1–0.|$|E
500|$|The {{starting}} pitcher matchup saw eventual Cy Young Award and Major League Baseball Triple Crown winner Jake <b>Peavy</b> against the Rockies Josh Fogg, who teammate Matt Holliday nicknamed [...] "Dragon Slayer" [...] for his strong performances against ace starters throughout the season. The Rockies opened {{the bottom of}} the first inning with a leadoff double by Kaz Matsui, followed by a Troy Tulowitzki single and a walk to Matt Holliday to load the bases. Matsui scored on a sacrifice fly by Todd Helton and Garrett Atkins made the game 2–0 with a single which scored Tulowitzki. Yorvit Torrealba later added to that lead, leading off {{the bottom of the}} second inning with a solo home run. The Padres took the lead {{in the top of the}} third, however, loading the bases via singles from <b>Peavy</b> and Scott Hairston and a walk to Brian Giles. Adrian Gonzalez then hit a grand slam home run, making the score 4–3. This was Gonzalez' first career grand slam. Khalil Greene then singled, advanced to third base on a double by Josh Bard, and scored on a ground out by Brady Clark. Helton homered in the bottom of the inning to close the gap to 5–4 in favor of San Diego.|$|E
500|$|Kershaw {{finished}} the 2011 season by leading the NL with 21 wins, 248 strikeouts and a 2.28 ERA, winning the NL pitching Triple Crown, the first Triple Crown winner since Jake <b>Peavy</b> of the 2007 San Diego Padres {{and the first}} Dodger since Sandy Koufax won it in the 1966 season. Justin Verlander of the Detroit Tigers won the American League Triple Crown the same season, marking the first major-league season since 1924 to feature Triple Crown-winning pitchers in both leagues. Kershaw's 21 wins were the most by a Dodger pitcher since Orel Hershiser won 23 during the 1988 season.

[...] The Giants selected left-hander Madison Bumgarner, who had an 18–10 win–loss record and 2.98 ERA during the season, as their starting pitcher. [...] He was chosen over Jake <b>Peavy,</b> given the southpaw's superior record on the road during the season; Bumgarner compiled an 11–4 win–loss record with a 2.22 ERA on the road, compared to a 7–6 record and 4.03 ERA at AT Park.|$|E

Bonds passed Mays on the career home run list by hitting his 661st off of Ben Ford on April 13, He then hit his 700th off of Jake <b>Peavy</b> on September 17. Bonds hit 45 home runs in 373 at-bats, and struck out just 41 times, putting himself in elite company, as few major leaguers have ever had more home runs than strikeouts in a season. Bonds would win his fourth consecutive MVP award and his seventh overall. His seven MVP awards are four {{more than any other}} player in history. In addition, no other player from either league has been awarded the MVP four times in a row. (The MVP award was first given in 1931). The 40-year-old Bonds also broke Willie Stargell's 25-year record as the oldest player to win a Most Valuable Player Award (Stargell, at 39 years, 8 months, was National League co-MVP with Keith Hernandez in 1979).

In mid-July, the White Sox switched to a six-man rotation. By early August, Humber was in a slump. Humber denies the extra rest affected his pitch command. He spent time on the disabled list with a facial bruise after Kosuke Fukudome lined a baseball into his face above the right eye on August 18. After he was hit, he was very concerned for his wife: [...] "I thought, 'I've got to get up because she's in the stands,'" [...] Humber said. [...] "As soon as I went in , I asked one of the guys to call her to make sure she knew I was OK.", adding [...] "My main concern was cheering up my wife."
