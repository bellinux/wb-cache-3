25|$|The Brussels Loom was {{introduced}} into England towards {{the middle of}} the eighteenth century marked {{the beginning of a new}} era in carpet-weaving. It was the first loom on which a <b>pile</b> <b>carpet</b> could be woven mechanically, the pile consisting of rows of loops, formed over wires inserted weftwise during weaving and subsequently withdrawn. Brussels was the first type of carpet to be woven in a loom incorporating the jacquard pattern selecting mechanism and in 1849 power was applied to the loom by Biglow in the U.S.A.|$|E
25|$|The {{bearers of}} the Pazyryk culture were horse-riding {{pastoral}} nomads of the steppe, and some may have accumulated great wealth through horse trading with merchants in Persia, India and China. This wealth {{is evident in}} the wide array of finds from the Pazyryk tombs, which include many rare examples of organic objects such as felt hangings, Chinese silk, the earliest known <b>pile</b> <b>carpet,</b> horses decked out in elaborate trappings, and wooden furniture and other household goods. These finds were preserved when water seeped into the tombs in antiquity and froze, encasing the burial goods in ice, which remained frozen in the permafrost until the time of their excavation.|$|E
50|$|Carpet {{styles are}} divided into two basic types. These types are loop <b>pile</b> <b>carpets</b> and cut <b>pile</b> <b>carpets.</b> Especially for {{cut-pile}} and its variations (Saxony, shag, frieze) the heat setting process is of highest importance.|$|R

25|$|One of {{the most}} famous finds at Pazyryk is the Pazyryk carpet, which is {{probably}} the oldest surviving <b>pile</b> <b>carpet</b> in the world. It measures 183×200cm and has a knot density of approximately 360,000 knots per square meter, which is higher than most modern carpets. The middle of the carpet consists of a ribbon motif, while in the border there is a procession with elk or deer, and in another border warriors on horses. The Pazyryk carpet was probably manufactured in Armenia or Persia around 400 BC. When it was found it had been deeply frozen in a block of ice, which is why it is so well-preserved. The carpet can be seen at the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia.|$|E

The earliest surviving <b>pile</b> <b>carpet</b> is the [...] "Pazyryk carpet", which dates from the 5th-4th century BC. It was excavated by Sergei Ivanovich Rudenko in 1949 from a Pazyryk burial mound in the Altai Mountains in Siberia. This richly coloured carpet is 200 x 183cm (6'6" [...] x 6'0") and framed by a border of griffins.|$|E
2500|$|The first tomb at Pazyryk, barrow 1, was {{excavated}} by the archaeologist M. P. Gryaznov in 1929; barrows 2-5 were excavated by Sergei Ivanovich Rudenko in 1947-1949. While many of {{the tombs}} had already been looted in earlier times, the excavators unearthed buried horses, and with them immaculately preserved cloth saddles, felt and woven rugs including the world's oldest <b>pile</b> <b>carpet,</b> a [...] from the 5th century BC and other splendid objects that had escaped the ravages of time. These finds are now exhibited at the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg.|$|E

50|$|The {{quality of}} cut <b>pile</b> <b>carpets</b> is {{improved}} significantly by {{a reduction of}} inner tensions in the yarn. This essential benefit results {{from the effects of}} steaming and heatsetting.|$|R
2500|$|On a knotted <b>pile</b> <b>carpet</b> (formally, a [...] "supplementary weft cut-loop pile" [...] carpet), the {{structural}} weft threads alternate with a supplementary weft that rises {{at right angles}} {{to the surface of the}} weave. This supplementary weft is attached to the warp by one of three knot types (see below), such as shag carpet which was popular in the 1970s, to form the pile or nap of the carpet. Knotting by hand is most prevalent in oriental rugs and carpets. Kashmir carpets are also hand-knotted. Pile carpets, like flat carpets, can be woven on a loom. Both vertical and horizontal looms have been used in the production of European and oriental carpets. The warp threads are set up on the frame of the loom before weaving begins. A number of weavers may work together on the same carpet. A row of knots is completed and cut. The knots are secured with (usually one to four) rows of weft. The warp in woven carpet is usually cotton and the weft is jute.|$|E
2500|$|Knotted <b>pile</b> <b>carpet</b> weaving {{technology}} probably came to England in {{the early}} 16th century with Flemish Calvinists fleeing religious persecution. Because many of these weavers settled in South-eastern England in Norwich the 14 extant 16th and 17th century carpets are {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "Norwich carpets." [...] These works are either adaptations of Anatolian or Indo-Persian designs or employ Elizabethan-Jacobean scrolling vines and blossoms. All but one are dated or bear a coat of arms. Like the French, English weavers used the symmetrical knot. There are documented and surviving examples of carpets from three 18th-century manufactories: [...] Exeter (1756–1761, owned by Claude Passavant, 3 extant carpets), Moorfields (1752–1806, owned by Thomas Moore, 5 extant carpets), and Axminster (1755–1835, owned by Thomas Whitty, numerous extant carpets). Exeter and Moorfields were both staffed with renegade weavers from the French Savonnerie and, therefore, employ the weaving structure of that factory and Perrot-inspired designs. Neoclassical designer Robert Adam supplied designs for both Moorfields and Axminster carpets based on Roman floor mosaics and coffered ceilings. Some of the most well-known rugs of his design were made for Syon House, Osterley House, Harewood House, Saltram House, and Newby Hall.|$|E

2500|$|Machine-woven carpets like Axminster and Wilton {{are made}} by massive looms that weave {{together}} ‘bobbins’ of carpet yarn and backing. The finished result, which can be intricately patterned, creates a floor that provides supreme underfoot luxury with high performance. Tufted carpets are also popular in the home. They are relatively speedy to make - a pre-woven backing has yarns tufted into it. Needles push the yarn through the backing and which is then held in place with underlying [...] "loopers". Tufted carpets can be twist pile, velvet, or loop <b>pile.</b> Twist <b>pile</b> <b>carpets</b> are produced when one or more fibres are twisted in the tufting process, {{so that in the}} finished carpet they appear to be bound together. Velvet <b>pile</b> <b>carpets</b> tend to have a shorter pile and a tighter construction, giving the finished article a smooth, velvety appearance. Loop <b>pile</b> <b>carpets</b> are renowned for being hard wearing and lend carpets great texture. The traditional domain of rugs from far away continents, hand knotted squares and rugs use the expertise of weavers to produce work of the finest quality. Traditional rugs often feature a deliberate ‘mistake’ on behalf of the weaver to guarantee their authenticity.|$|R
