5|$|The {{capture of}} Fort San Miguel allowed the Portuguese sappers to {{complete}} the circumvallation works, which consisted of a continuous line of little forts, each able to garrison as many as about 200 soldiers, or perhaps as few as 25 musketeers. The Spanish also continued strengthening their defenses. The Southwestern section of the wall was fortified at Pedraleras, and a ravelin was erected 400 meters {{in front of the}} Gate of Santa Maria. No significant action took place during this period, except for an ambush near San Gabriel by André de Albuquerque, against a Spanish supply convoy sent from La Albuera, and various sorties by the garrison of Badajoz to try to obstruct the Portuguese works. A night attack by the Spanish Duke of Osuna against a <b>Portuguese</b> <b>section</b> cost Mendes de Vasconcelos 200 infantry and 40 horses.|$|E
25|$|The {{party was}} founded in 1921 as the <b>Portuguese</b> <b>section</b> of the Communist International (Comintern). Made illegal after a coup in the late 1920s, the PCP {{played a major role}} in the {{opposition}} to the dictatorial regime of António de Oliveira Salazar. During the five-decades-long dictatorship, the party was constantly suppressed by the political police, the PIDE, which forced its members to live in clandestine status under the threat of arrest, torture, and murder. After the Carnation Revolution in 1974, which overthrew the 48-year regime, the 36 members of party's Central Committee had, in the aggregate, experienced more than 300 years in jail.|$|E

[...] Prior to the 2013 conclave, this tradition was last followed at the 1958 conclave by the newly elected Pope John XXIII, who bestowed his cardinal's skull cap on Alberto di Jorio and created him a cardinal at the consistory on 15 December of that year.

500|$|The {{sight of}} the {{approaching}} Allied line forced Soult's hand—if Cole's division was not stopped, defeat was certain. He sent four regiments of Latour-Maubourg's dragoons to charge the <b>Portuguese</b> <b>section</b> of Cole's line, and committed the whole of Werlé's reserve to protect VCorps' flank. [...] The dragoons swept down on Harvey's Portuguese brigade fully expecting to destroy it as they had Colborne's. The inexperienced Portuguese, however, stood firm and drove away the cavalry without even forming square. Having once been repulsed, Latour-Maubourg's dragoons made no further attack on Cole's division, and the Allied line marched on. The Fusilier brigade and Lusitanian Legion on the division's left soon encountered Werlé's brigade, which outnumbered them two to one. [...] Despite his advantage in numbers, Werlé had formed his nine battalions into three columns of regiments, and could not bring as many muskets to bear as the Allies. Three separate regimental musket duels ensued, as the 23rd Royal Welch Fusiliers and the two battalions of the 7th Fusiliers each took on a column. [...] During the fire-fight the French tried once more to extend into line, but as before the concentrated Allied fire prevented their deployment. After 20–30 minutes of bitter conflict they finally broke and ran. [...] The Fusiliers had lost more than half their numbers, mainly to artillery fire, while Werlé's brigade had suffered 1,800 casualties.|$|E

40|$|Quantitative {{analyses}} {{were made of}} the foraminiferal assemblages in 137 samples from five <b>Portuguese</b> <b>sections</b> (Murtinheira, Brenha, Tojeira 1, Tojeira 2 and Mareta Beach) of Middle and Late Jurassic age. Trends in depositional environment (for example from deep to shallow water sediments) together with R- and Q-mode analyses determined three different groups of foraminifera, each group having its own bathymetric preference. Spirillina tenuissima, Spirillina elongata, Spirillina infima, Ophthalmidium carinatum and Paalzowellalei/eli preferred relatively shallow water, up to about 50 metres. Epistomina mosquensis, Pseudolamarckina rjasanensis, Ophthalmidium strumosum and the agglutinated foraminifera preferred relatively deep water, from about 200 to 250 metres or possibly more. Lenticulina muensteri, Lenticulina spp., Discorbis spp., Eoguttulina spp. and Nodosaria/Dentalina spp. filled the depth niche in between, from about 50 to over 150 metres. Eoguttulina spp. and Nodosaria/Dentalina spp. probably preferred depths closer to 150 than to 50 metres. Coeval foraminiferal assemblages from 18 wells on the Grand Banks off Newfoundland proved to be closely {{similar to those of}} Portugal, allowing for a more precise estimate of the paleowaterdepths of Middle and Upper Jurassic sediments of the Grand Banks. Middle Jurassic representatives of the genera Garantella, Reinholdella and Epistomina occur in three wells on the Grand Banks, but are not known from the coeval parts of any other wells and any of the <b>Portuguese</b> <b>sections.</b> This is explained as being the result of local differences in depositional environment; the epistominids preferring relatively deep water. Two new biostratigraphic zones are defined: (1) Reinholdella spp. Zone of (Late) Bathonian age, and (2) Epistomina regularis Zone of Callovian age. A range chart shows the stratigraphic distribution of taxa known from the Grand Banks and Portugal.

40|$|It is {{intended}} {{that this study}} {{will contribute to the}} growing record of knowledge on the stratigraphic distribution of Jurassic calcareous nannofossils in order to extend their biostratigraphic and correlatory use. Over two hundred samples from six sections in Jurassic sediments from Portugal were examined in light and scanning electron microscopes. The taxonomic aspects of the flora were studied and the stratigraphic ranges of the species and their abundances were recorded. Four of the sections cover the Lower and Middle Jurassic and these are in fully marine facies. One of the Upper Jurassic sections, Torres Vedras, is also in marine sediments but the second, the Alcanede-Carvalhos Road Section reflects part of a regressive phase which culminated in the deposition of brackish water and non-marine sediments in the basin {{to the north of the}} River Tagus during the Upper Jurassic (oýr Lusitanian stage of Portuguese geology). The stratigraphic position of the two Upper Jurassic sections is not well known. It was hoped that the examination of the calcareous nannofossils in fifteen samples from a Callovian to Oxfordian section on the Isle of Skye and in 75 samples from three Upper Jurassic cores in the western North Atlantic. would enable correlation of species and thus resolve the question of the stratigraphic position of the Upper Jurassic <b>Portuguese</b> <b>sections.</b> In fact, it only proved possible to locate the Torres Vedras Section which was of Callovian to Lower Kimmeridgian age. In addition, fourteen samples from a Triassic to lowermost Jurassic (Hettangian) section from Watchet in North Somerset, England were examined in a preliminary investigation of the early calcareous nannofossil record. The group is generally accepted as first appearing in the Lower Jurassic but the Rhaetian. samples from Watchet contained a limited assemblage which showed that a pre-Jurassic record exists. Further evidence for this was found in a reconnaissance survey of Triassic sediment from Italy. finally, a biostratigraphic scheme is developed from the results obtained in this study and from other published data...|$|R

40|$|OBJETIVE: The {{advance of}} {{research}} in child and adolescent psychiatry in Brazil heavily depends {{on the existence of}} instruments for the investigation of psychiatric syndromes adapted to Brazilian Portuguese. METHODS: This article describes a careful process of translation of the Children's Interview for Psychiatric Syndromes for the purpose of use in research in Brazil. The Children's Interview for Psychiatric Syndromes has a version for parents (P-ChIPs) and a version for children (ChIPS). In this article, the sections of P-ChIPS referring to attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional-defiant disorder, conduct disorder, mania/hypomania, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and psychotic disorders were translated to Brazilian <b>Portuguese.</b> The <b>sections</b> of the ChIPS referring to substance use disorders, social anxiety disorder, specific phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety disoder, separation anxiety disorder, post-traumatic disorders and depression/dysthimia were also adapted. Each section was translated by two independent translators and later discussed in a committee composed of experts in the field of Psychiatry and a professional of the field of linguistics. RESULT: A final version containing an interview for the main psychiatric syndromes was defined.
