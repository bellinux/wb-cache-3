40|$|This paper {{describes}} a preliminary work aimed at setting a therapeutic support for autistic teenagers using three humanoid robots NAO shared by ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) subjects. The studied population had attended successfully a first year program, and were observed {{with a second}} year program using the robots. This paper focuses on the content {{and the effects of}} the second year program. The approach is based on a master puppet concept: the subjects program the robots, and use them as an extension for communication. Twenty sessions were organized, alternating ten <b>preparatory</b> <b>sessions</b> and ten robotics programming <b>sessions.</b> During the <b>preparatory</b> <b>sessions,</b> the subjects write a story to be played by the robots. During the robot programming sessions, the subjects program the motions to be realized to make the robot tell the story. The program was concluded by a public performance. The experiment involves five ASD teenagers aged 12 - 15, who had all attended the first year robotics training. As a result, a progress in voluntary and organized communication skills of the five subjects was observed, leading to improvements in social organization, focus, voluntary communication, programming, reading and writing abilities. The changes observed in the subjects general behavior took place in a short time, and could be observed from one robotics session to the next one. The approach allowed the subjects to draw the limits of their body with respect to the environment, and therefore helped them confronting the world with less anxiety...|$|R

When the council met on 16 October 1962, a new slate of commission members was presented and approved by the Council. One important change was a significant increase in membership from Central and Northern Europe, instead of countries such as Spain or Italy. More than 100 bishops from Africa, Asia, and Latin America were Dutch or Belgian and tended to associate with the bishops from those countries. These groups were led by Cardinals Bernardus Johannes Alfrink of the Netherlands and Leo Suenens of Belgium.|$|R

Ottaviani, while opposed to the separation of Church and State and granting equal rights to all religions, supported religious tolerance—suppressing public manifestations of non-Catholic religions when possible. Their confrontation became so intense that Cardinal Ernesto Ruffini had to intervene, noting his disappointment at such a [...] "serious discussion". Ottaviani also argued during the debates on the liturgy and on the sources of Divine Revelation, which are understood as Scripture and Tradition in Catholic theology.|$|R

In this regard, the participants were informed that they would be asked to make a drawing to give to a puppet that the researcher brought with him. In addition, the researcher told the children he would ask them a few questions about some pictures that the puppet had also brought. It is worth noting that the children’s drawings were not the objective of this research. However drawing and colouring is very familiar to young children and an activity which they are fond of (Karniol, 2011). Therefore, this activity was used to start the individual meetings as a means of creating a friendly and comfortable atmosphere that encourages young children to partake in the whole of the activity proposed.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This article explores various {{analytical}} {{issues involved}} in conceptual-izing the interrelationships of gender, class, race and ethnicity and other social divisions. It compares the debate on these issues {{that took place in}} Britain in the 1980 s and around the 2001 UN World Conference Against Racism. It examines issues such as the relative helpfulness of additive or mutually constitutive models of intersectional social divisions; the different analytical levels at which social divisions need to be studied, their ontological base and their relations to each other. The final section of the article attempts critically to assess a specific inter-sectional methodological approach for engaging in aid and human rights work in the South. KEY WORDS identity politics ◆ intersectionality ◆ social divisions ◆ social positionings In the introduction to her book Ain’t I a Woman, bell hooks (1981) poured scorn on the then common analogue many feminists used between the situation of women and the situation of Blacks. ‘This implies’, she argued, ‘that all women are White and all Blacks are men. ’ That was one of the starting points of an analytical and political move by Black and other feminists and social scientists to deconstruct the categories of both ‘women ’ and ‘Blacks ’ and to develop an analysis of the intersectionality of various social divisions, most often – but not exclusively – focusing on gender, race and class (for a more detailed history see, for example, Brah and Phoenix, 2004). The term ‘intersectionality ’ itself was introduced by Kimberlé Crenshaw (1989), when she discussed issues of black women’s employ-ment in the US. She was eventually invited to introduce the notion of intersectionality before a special session on the subject in Geneva during the <b>preparatory</b> <b>session</b> to the World Conference Against Racism (WCAR...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis contributes to the general body of knowledge of research into engineering education. The main scope of the thesis is on enhancing laboratory education. There are three main types of laboratory: virtual, hands-on and remote. The hands-on lab is {{the oldest and most}} commonly used medium for experiential education in undergraduate degrees of science and engineering. The literature review of laboratory education has shown that hands-on labs suffer from many disadvantages, which can be overcome by utilizing hybrid laboratory structures that incorporate virtual and/or remote modes. The investigation into enhanced laboratory education is achieved via implementing new technical and pedagogical models of conducting laboratories. The technical model incorporates three access modes (virtual, hands-on and remote) to the laboratory experience in one software package called the TriLab. The TriLab concept has been applied to the Process Control Lab at the Chemical Engineering Department of Loughborough University and has been implemented using LabVIEW. The Joomla web content management system was used to develop an online portal for disseminating the remote component of the TriLab resulting in the first remote lab portal of Loughborough University {{and one of the few}} available in the UK. A pedagogical model of laboratory education based on Kolb’s experiential learning theory and by the utilization of the TriLab concept is proposed. The model is built on a hypothesis, which states that the poor learning outcomes of hands-on laboratory sessions can be associated with poor activation of the stages of Kolb’s experiential learning cycle. It has been proposed that access to a virtual lab in a <b>preparatory</b> <b>session</b> will play a role in activating the stages of Kolb’s cycle. To verify this, educational experimentation procedures were designed and applied to two groups, control and experimental. Measurements via pre- and post-lab tests, marks for the laboratory report and the final exam of the module have been performed. The statistical analysis of the measurements has supported the stated hypothesis and solution proposal. The proposed pedagogical model is one of the few that provide a way of conducting laboratory education based on constructivist educational theories. (Continues [...] .) ...|$|E

This study examined the relationship between the motivational climate created by the PE teacher and the intrinsic motivation of the <b>preparatory</b> <b>sessions</b> together with self-confidence and anxiety prior to competition and pre- and post-competition mood states. The sample was made up of school children (M age = 11. 7) from a state school (N = 115), who, after an introduction to an athletics course of 12 sessions, took part in a sports competition. During this time, a teacher (trained to this effect) manipulated the motivational climate, adapting the strategies of TARGET (11, 12, 26, 28). The mastery climate was linked to enjoyment, perceived ability, and effort in the PE classes, as well as to pre-competition somatic anxiety and post-competition vigor.
