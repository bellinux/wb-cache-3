5|$|Single cross hybrids {{result from}} the cross between two true-breeding organisms which <b>produces</b> <b>an</b> F1 hybrid (first filial generation). The cross between two {{different}} homozygous lines <b>produces</b> <b>an</b> F1 hybrid that is heterozygous; having two alleles, one contributed by each parent and typically one is dominant and the other recessive. Typically, the F1 generation is also phenotypically homogeneous, producing offspring that are all similar to each other.|$|E

5|$|Clarinet choir, which {{features}} {{a large number of}} clarinets playing together, usually involves a range of different members of the clarinet family (see Extended family of clarinets).

5|$|Over 340species {{of plants}} grow on the rocks, {{including}} approximately 200species of wildflowers. Some {{of the most}} common wildflowers are western buttercups, desert parsley, bicolor lupine, and California goldfields. Camas and death camas also grow on the rocks. Camas <b>produces</b> <b>an</b> edible bulb, while death camas is poisonous and was used by the Takelma as an anesthetic.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{consumer}} of tellurium is metallurgy in iron, stainless steel, copper, and lead alloys. The addition to steel and copper <b>produces</b> <b>an</b> alloy more machinable than otherwise. It is alloyed into cast iron for promoting chill for spectroscopy, where {{the presence of}} electrically conductive free graphite tends to interfere with spark emission testing results. In lead, tellurium improves strength and durability, and decreases the corrosive action of sulfuric acid.|$|E

5|$|The {{rotation}} {{of a star}} <b>produces</b> <b>an</b> equatorial bulge due to centrifugal force. As stars are not solid bodies, they can also undergo differential rotation.

5|$|Although animals {{generally}} express fewer {{variants of}} the dicer enzyme than plants, RNAi in some animals <b>produces</b> <b>an</b> antiviral response. In both juvenile and adult Drosophila, RNA interference {{is important in}} antiviral innate immunity and is active against pathogens such as Drosophila X virus. A similar role in immunity may operate in C. elegans, as argonaute proteins are upregulated in response to viruses and worms that overexpress components of the RNAi pathway are resistant to viral infection.|$|E
5|$|Ape Escape is a {{platform}} video game, developed by SCE Japan Studio {{and published by}} Sony Computer Entertainment. It was released for the PlayStation in May 1999 in North America, and June 1999 in Japan. The first in the Ape Escape series, the game {{tells the story of}} an ape named Specter who gains enhanced intelligence and a malevolent streak through the use of an experimental helmet. Specter <b>produces</b> <b>an</b> army of apes, which he sends through time in an attempt to rewrite history. Spike, the player character, sets out to capture the apes with the aid of special gadgets.|$|E

5|$|Bell {{explained}} that he, Jed Whedon, and Tancharoen supervise {{all of the}} series' creative decisions, often consulting with Loeb. When the showrunners are writing the series, one person can write a script while the other two break stories, so that a story can be broken every few weeks. If the executive producers sign off on a story, {{a member of the}} series' writers room then <b>produces</b> <b>an</b> outline, gets notes on it from the showrunners, writes a full script, gets notes on it from ABC and the production crew, and then goes to set to produce the episode.|$|E

Of these students, 18,892 received a bachelor's degree, 5,386 received a master's degree, and 462 received a first professional degree. This means the state of Oklahoma <b>produces</b> <b>an</b> average of 38,278 degree-holders per completions component (i.e. July 1, 2007 – June 30, 2008). National average is 68,322 total degrees awarded per completions component.|$|E
5|$|No seed is set when pollinators are excluded, {{indicating}} that seed set must be pollinator-limited. About 96% of fertilized follicles mature, and about 82% of seeds mature. These {{are very high}} numbers for Banksia, {{indicating that}} there are no problems with nutrient supply. This species <b>produces</b> <b>an</b> unusually high number of old flowerheads, or cones, per plant—typically more than 500. However, there are an unusually low number of follicles per cone—often only one. Thus the number of follicles per plant ends up roughly average for a Banksia species.|$|E

50|$|Several gas or metal-vapor lamps {{can also}} be used. When {{operated}} at low pressure and current, these lamps generally produce light in various spectral lines, {{with one or two}} lines being most predominant. Because these lines are very narrow, the lamps can be combined with narrow-bandwidth filters to isolate the strongest line. A helium-discharge lamp will <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> line at 587.6 nm (yellow) while <b>a</b> mercury-vapor lamp <b>produces</b> <b>a</b> line at 546.1 (yellowish green). Cadmium vapor <b>produces</b> <b>a</b> line at 643.8 (red), but low pressure sodium <b>produces</b> <b>a</b> line at 589.3 (yellow). Of all the lights, low pressure sodium {{is the only one that}} <b>produces</b> <b>a</b> single line, requiring no filter.|$|R
5|$|Pulveroboletus ravenelii <b>produces</b> <b>an</b> olive-grey to olive-brown spore print. Spores are {{elliptical}} to oval, smooth, {{and measure}} 8–10 by 4–5μm. The hyphal {{tissue in the}} hymenophore is inamyloid and bilateral, meaning it diverges downward from the flesh {{toward the edge of}} the hymenophore, away from a central strand. The tubes have scattered cystidia on the walls (pleurocystidia) and abundant cystidia on the edges (cheilocystidia). The hyphae in the cap cuticle are arranged as an ixotrichodermium–long and typically multi-celled, with erect hyphae embedded in a gelatinous matrix. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{performs}} {{an autopsy}} on McRoberts' body and discovers signs of phobia including {{high levels of}} adrenaline and the same substance found on the elevator killer. She hypothesizes that the substance, when combined with other neurochemicals, <b>produces</b> <b>an</b> LSD-like reaction. While Mulder and Scully build a case, Funsch becomes more psychotic, continuing to see violent messages on electronic gadgets. Blood is associated in some way with each incident; a volunteer asks Ed to donate blood at a department store and seconds later he sees violent images, including a video of the 1993 Waco siege burning, flash across a sales display of TV sets, followed by a message to get a gun from the sporting goods department.|$|E
5|$|Sericulture, the rearing of silkworms, {{was first}} {{adopted by the}} Chinese during the Shang dynasty. The only species farmed commercially is the domesticated silkmoth. When it spins its cocoon, each larva <b>produces</b> <b>an</b> {{exceedingly}} long, slender thread of silk. The larvae feed on mulberry leaves and in Europe, only one generation is normally raised each year as this is a deciduous tree. In China, Korea and Japan however, two generations are normal, and in the tropics, multiple generations are expected. Most production of silk occurs in the Far East, with a synthetic diet being used to rear the silkworms in Japan.|$|E
