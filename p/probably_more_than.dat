5|$|Although the edibility of S.amygdalinus is {{not known}} with certainty, {{authorities}} often recommend to avoid consuming blue-staining, red-pored boletes, as several are poisonous.

5|$|According to Tchernov's 1962 paper, Passer predomesticus {{was found}} in the middle Acheulean (middle Pleistocene, <b>probably</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 400,000 years old) layer E1 of the Oumm-Qatafa cave in Wadi Khareitoun near Bethlehem. In 1984, however, Tchernov wrote that P.predomesticus was about 140,000 years old, from the Yabrudian. Layer E1 {{contained}} remains of about 40bird species, including a premaxilla Tchernov described as a precursor of the Dead Sea sparrow (Passer moabiticus) and a tarsometatarsus and humerus tentatively allied with the house sparrow. An undetermined Acheulean layer of the same cave also contained fossils Tchernov described as precursors of both the house and Spanish sparrows.|$|E

5|$|On September 1, 1857, a joint {{force of}} Mohave and Quechan warriors {{launched}} a major attack {{with hundreds of}} warriors on a Maricopa village close to Maricopa Wells, Arizona, on the Gila river. The Battle of Pima Butte was described {{by a group of}} white mail carriers who witnessed it. They stated that the battle was fought mostly with clubs, as well as bows and arrows, and that <b>probably</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 100 warriors died, most of them from the attacking party. It is unknown whether Irataba participated in the attack, but given his status as kwanami, it is likely that he did. The battle has been described as the last major battle involving only Native American nations. This defeat put the Mohave on the defensive, wary of the possibility that whites would take this moment of weakness as an opportunity to begin settling on tribal lands.|$|E
5|$|Sometime {{during the}} 20th or 21st Dynasty Amenhotep's {{original}} tomb was either robbed or deemed insecure and emptied {{and his body}} was moved for safety, <b>probably</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> once. It {{was found in the}} Deir el-Bahri Cache, hidden with the mummies of numerous New Kingdom kings and nobles in or after the late 22nd dynasty above the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut and is now in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. His mummy had apparently not been looted by the 21st dynasty, and the priests who moved the mummy took care to keep the Cartonnage intact. Because of that exquisite face mask, Amenhotep's is the only royal mummy which has not been unwrapped and examined by modern Egyptologists.|$|E
5|$|The {{final results}} of the Italian {{campaign}} were limited {{in terms of the}} advantages gained by the Empire. The city of Ancona became a Byzantine base in Italy, accepting the Emperor as sovereign. The Normans of Sicily had been damaged and now came to terms with the Empire, ensuring peace for the rest of Manuel's reign. The Empire's ability to get involved in Italian affairs had been demonstrated. However, given the enormous quantities of gold which had been lavished on the project, it also demonstrated the limits of what money and diplomacy alone could achieve. The expense of Manuel's involvement in Italy must have cost the treasury a great deal (<b>probably</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 2,160,000 hyperpyra or 30,000 pounds of gold), and yet it produced only limited solid gains.|$|E

5|$|While the Scottish Enlightenment is {{traditionally}} {{considered to have}} concluded {{toward the end of}} the 18th century, disproportionately large Scottish contributions to British science and letters continued for another 50 years or more, thanks to such figures as the physicists James Clerk Maxwell and Lord Kelvin, and the engineers and inventors James Watt and William Murdoch, whose work was critical to the technological developments of the Industrial Revolution throughout Britain. In literature the most successful figure of the mid-19th century was Walter Scott. His first prose work, Waverley in 1814, is often called the first historical novel. It launched a highly successful career that <b>probably</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> any other helped define and popularise Scottish cultural identity. In the late 19th century, a number of Scottish-born authors achieved international reputations, such as Robert Louis Stevenson, Arthur Conan Doyle, J. M. Barrie and George MacDonald. Scotland also played a major part in the development of art and architecture. The Glasgow School, which developed in the late 19th century, and flourished in the early 20th century, produced a distinctive blend of influences including the Celtic Revival the Arts and Crafts Movement, and Japonisme, which found favour throughout the modern art world of continental Europe and helped define the Art Nouveau style. Proponents included architect and artist Charles Rennie Mackintosh.|$|E

25|$|The {{religion}} {{is one of}} Europe's indigenous religions of unbroken lineage which have survived Christianisation, although it has co-existed with Russian Orthodoxy for generations. Many Mari today are baptized as Christians yet they attend traditional prayers rather than Church services. A sociological survey conducted in 2004 found that about 15 {{percent of the population}} of Mari El consider themselves adherents of the Mari native religion. Since Mari make up just 45 percent of the republic's population of 700,000, this figure means that <b>probably</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a third claim to follow the old religion.|$|E

So, protected from moths and souvenir hunters by his humidity-controlled glass case, Comanche stands patiently, enduring generation after generation of undergraduate jokes. The other horses are gone, and the mysterious yellow bulldog is gone, which means that in a sense the legend is true. Comanche alone survived.|$|E
25|$|Still, {{these first}} bridges {{were in no}} sense {{technically}} complicated or physically impressive, but rather simple wooden bridges, either floating bridges or beam bridges resting on poles or stone caissons, in either case with spans {{of no more than}} a few metres. The width probably corresponded to the directions for public roads, eight ell or 4,8 metres, which was <b>probably</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> enough for many centuries. The long and narrow bridges were easily demolished in case of siege, which besides the drawbridges, also necessary for the passing of ships, was an important defensive strategy. As the accounts of the city tells, spring floods and ice break-ups resulted in the frequent destruction of the bridges.|$|E
25|$|Pain in babies, {{and whether}} babies feel pain, {{has been the}} subject of debate within the medical {{profession}} for centuries. Prior to the late nineteenth century it was generally considered that babies hurt more easily than adults. It was only in the last quarter of the 20th century that scientific techniques finally established babies definitely do experience pain – <b>probably</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> adults – and has developed reliable means of assessing and of treating it. As recently as 1999, it was commonly stated that babies could not feel pain until they were a year old, but today it is believed newborns and likely even fetuses beyond a certain age can experience pain.|$|E

25|$|In 1993, Castles and Coltheart {{describe}} developmental dyslexia as two prevalent {{and distinct}} varieties using the subtypes of Alexia (acquired dyslexia), Surface and Phonological Dyslexia. Understanding these subtypes {{is useful in}} diagnosing learning patterns and developing approaches for overcoming visual perception impairments or speech discrimination deficits. Cestnick and Coltheart (1999) demonstrated what these underlying deficits are in part, through unveiling different profiles of phonological versus surface dyslexics. Surface Dyslexia is characterized by subjects who can read known words but who have trouble reading words that are irregular. Phonological Dyslexia is characterized by subjects who can read aloud both regular and irregular words but have difficulties with non-words and with connecting sounds to symbols, or with sounding out words. Phonological processing tasks predict reading accuracy and comprehension. Cestnick and Jerger (2000) and Cestnick (2001) further demonstrated distinct processing differences between phonological and surface dyslexics. Manis et al. 1996, concluded that there were <b>probably</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> two subtypes of dyslexia, which would be related to multiple underlying deficits.|$|E
25|$|The {{impact of}} the outside world on the {{existence}} of indigenous peoples and their cultures is described as being very dramatic. In Siberia, only 10% of the tribal peoples live a nomadic or semi-nomadic life, compared to 70% 30 years ago. In Brazil – where Survival believes most of the world’s uncontacted tribes, <b>probably</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 50, live – there are about 400 speakers for 110 languages. For authors such as Daniel Everett, this phenomenon represents a fundamental assault on the existence of peoples, as language expresses the way a group of people experience reality in a unique way, and it is a part of our common heritage. Ranka Bjeljac-Babic, lecturer and specialist in the psychology of language, describes an intrinsic and causal link between the threat of biological diversity and cultural diversity. The assault on indigenous customs and traditions is described {{as part of a larger}} assault on life, with its historical roots in colonization. Survival's report Progress can Kill highlights that the invasion of the Americas and Australia by Europeans eliminated 90% of the indigenous population on these continents. The threat of genocide continues.|$|E
