The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the accuracy of this technique for four physiological arm movements using opto-electronic markers mounted on scapular bone pins as a gold standard. Eight subjects had bone pins inserted into their lateral scapular spine. Three points were digitized on the scapula with an optoelectronic probe: the medial root of the scapular spine, the posterolateral corner of the acromion, and the inferior angle of the scapula. The four active movements tested in this study were glenohumeral abduction, glenohumeral horizontal adduction, hand behind back, and forward reaching. The three bony landmarks were digitized six times in three different positions for each movement. Data from one subject were rejected secondary to pin loosening. The overall position-specific r. m. <b>s.</b> <b>errors</b> ranged from 2. 0 u to 12. 5 u. The full abduction position had considerably higher r. m. <b>s.</b> <b>errors</b> than the other positions (posterior tipping, 12. 5 u; upward rotation, 7. 3 u; internal rotation, 12. 0 u). It appears that the digitization of bony landmarks may be a valid method for measuring changes in scapular attitude with the following caveats: the full abduction position has a high r. m. <b>s.</b> <b>error,</b> and small scapular motions have high percen-tage errors...|$|R

40|$|An intercomparison of nine {{chemical}} mechanisms (e. g. ADOM, CBM-IV, EMEP, RADM 2) as used by 12 contributing {{groups was}} conducted. The results for three scenarios are presented covering remote situations {{with a net}} O 3 loss of around 2. 7 ppb (LAND and FREE) and a moderately polluted situation with O 3 formation of around 100 ppb (PLUME 1) over a 5 day simulation period. The overall tendencies (i. e. the total net production/loss over 5 days) for O 3 show a r. m. <b>s.</b> <b>error</b> of 38, 15 and 16 %; for H 2 O 2 the errors are 76, 23 and 30 % (for LAND, FREE, PLUME 1). In terms of ozone production in PLUME 1, the most productive mechanisms are EMEP and IVL, the RADM-type mechanisms lie in the mid-range and the CBM-IV type mechanisms fall {{at the bottom of}} the range. The differences in H 2 O 2 can partly be explained by an incorrect use of the HO 2 + HO 2 rate constant and by differences in the treatment of the peroxy radical interactions. In the PLUME 1 case the r. m. <b>s.</b> <b>error</b> of the PAN tendency was found to be 29 %. Differences between mechanisms for the HO radical are 10, 15 and 19 % and for the NO 3 radical 35, 16 and 40 % (for LAND, FREE, PLUME 1) in terms of the r. m. <b>s.</b> <b>error</b> of the results for a 12 h time period centred around the last noon (HO), respectively, a 8 h time period centred around the last midnight (NO 3) of simulation.

40|$|Occupational {{regulation}} of many professions {{has grown in}} magnitude and complexity in the past fifty years. Statutes relating to occupational regulation are often implemented by state legislatures without sufficient quantitative analysis. Prior studies have analyzed the need for regulation to protect consumers. Some research has been published which addresses {{the differences in the}} quality of services offered by regulated and unregulated professions. Due to lack of data, the effect of state regulation on commercial income tax preparers has not been quantified. Recently data from the 1979 cycle of the Taxpayer Compliance Measurement Program (TCMP) has been made available by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). These data provided the opportunity for analysis relating to questions of quality of services offered by commercial income tax preparers. The analysis evaluated differences in error rates or amounts between returns prepared in a highly regulated state [...] Oregon, a state with minimum regulation [...] California, and the remaining forty-eight unregulated states. Items were chosen from the tax returns to evaluate the integrity and competency of the tax preparer, the effect of continuing education, and the accumulated effect of the totals of income, adjustments, and deductions. Descriptive statistics, cluster analysis, and non-parametric methods were used to test the hypotheses. Descriptive measures indicated that Oregon 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>error</b> rates were among the lowest while California 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>errors</b> were {{among the highest in the}} country. Cluster analysis grouped Oregon with states in the midwest while California grouped with other states in the sunbelt.

When Oregon was compared to the clustered states or to other states in the Northwest, the differences were not significant. When the samples from California were compared to those from the unregulated states, it was evident that the error rates were substantially higher in California. When California 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>errors</b> were considered relative to the states from the sunbelt, the results were similar. The final comparison was made relative to levels of regulation.

40|$|Permafrost and {{seasonally}} {{frozen ground}} are important surface features in high-latitudes. Because of this, a soil-frost parameterization {{was added to}} the Penn State University/NCAR mesoscale meteorological model MM 5 in combination with the well validated hydro-thermodynamic soil vegetation scheme HTSVS, which takes into account among other things soil freezing and thawing. Reanalysis of temperature, wind vector, specific humidity and observations of precipitation were used to evaluate the importance of the soil-frost parameterization on the forecast for an episode in summer. R. m. <b>s.</b> <b>errors</b> for both forecasts are reasonable with the largest errors coming from the precipitation data. Improvements in r. m. <b>s.</b> <b>error</b> for the forecast with the soil-frost parameterization added are mostly in the atmospheric boundary layer. Just as for r. m. <b>s.</b> <b>error,</b> the mean error for the soil-frost forecast is closer to zero than the mean error for the forecast made without the soil-frost parameterization. The consistent negative bias of the mean error is also improved by the inclusion of soil-frost. For precipitation, the wind vector, and in the mid-troposphere for temperature, the improvement index of the forecasts decreases as time increases, meaning that the inclusion of soil-frost makes the model more accurate especially as it is projected farther into the future. However, for the atmospheric boundary layer temperatures and for specific humidity the improvement index actually increases with time, meaning that the addition of a soil-frost parameterization for these variables does not continue to improve the longer range forecast as much as it does for the other variables. Both the bias and threat scores decrease as the precipitation threshold increases and generally increase with time. In addition, according to the threat scores, inclusion of soil-frost processes improves the prediction of moderate precipitation. In general, it is shown that with the inclusion of a soil-frost parameter in the model, forecast errors are decreased. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} of microwave observations over land to determine atmospheric and surface parameters is still limited {{due to the}} complexity of the inverse problem. Neural network techniques have already proved successful as the basis of efficient retrieval methods for non-linear cases, however, first-guess estimates, which are used in variational methods to avoid problems of solution non-uniqueness or other forms of solution irregularity, have up to now not been used with neural network methods. In this study, a neural network approach is developed that uses a first-guess. Conceptual bridges are established between the neural network and variational methods. The new neural method retrieves the surface skin temperature, the integrated water vapor content, the cloud liquid water path and the microwave surface emissivities between 19 and 85 GHz over land from SSM/I observations. The retrieval, in parallel, of all these quantities improves the results for consistency reasons. A data base to train the neural network is calculated with a radiative transfer model and a a global collection of coincident surface and atmospheric parameters extracted from the National Center for Environmental Prediction reanalysis, from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project data and from microwave emissivity atlases previously calculated. The results of the neural network inversion are very encouraging. The r. m. <b>s.</b> <b>error</b> of the surface temperature retrieval over the globe is 1. 3 K in clear sky conditions and 1. 6 K in cloudy scenes. Water vapor is retrieved with a r. m. <b>s.</b> <b>error</b> of 3. 8 kg/sq m in clear conditions and 4. 9 kg/sq m in cloudy situations. The r. m. <b>s.</b> <b>error</b> in cloud liquid water path is 0. 08 kg/sq m.

The necessary algorithm was developed for the purpose. The best results were obtained using the hinge frequency 23. 834 GHz and 30 GHz pair having an r. m. <b>s.</b> <b>error</b> of only 2. 64.

Instead, while measuring the vapor content for separation of vapor and cloud liquid, one of them should be a few GHz left or right from the resonance line i. e., at 23. 834 GHz and the other one should be around 30 GHz.

This is qualitatively expected from mass-dependent post main sequence evolution. We here establish an empirical relation between these quantities by drawing on 1, 475 red giants with asteroseismic mass estimates from Kepler that also have spectroscopic labels from APOGEE DR 12. We assess the accuracy of our model, and find that it predicts stellar masses with fractional r. m. <b>s.</b> <b>errors</b> of about 14 % (typically 0. 2 Msun). From these masses, we derive ages with r. m. <b>s</b> <b>errors</b> of 40 %.

40|$|The {{design of}} {{powertrain}} controllers {{relies on the}} availability of data-driven models of the emissions formation from internal-combustion engines. Typically these are in the form of tables or statistical regression models based on data obtained from stabilised experiments. However, as the complexity of engine systems increases, the number of experiments required to obtain the effects of each actuator becomes large. In addition, the models are only valid under stable operating conditions and do not give any information as to dynamic behaviour. In this paper, the use of the Volterra series (dynamic polynomial models) calculated from dynamic measurements is presented {{as an alternative to the}} steady-state models. Dynamic measurements of gaseous exhaust emissions were taken for a 2. 0 l automotive diesel engine installed on a transient engine dynamometer.
