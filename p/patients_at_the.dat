5|$|The ant is notorious in Tasmania, {{where most}} {{fatalities}} have been recorded. In 2005, {{over a quarter}} of all jack jumper sting incidents were sustained in Tasmania; excessive in comparison to its 2006 population of only 476,000 people. Jack jumper stings are the single most common cause of anaphylaxis in <b>patients</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Royal Hobart Hospital. The ant has also been a major cause of anaphylaxis outside Tasmania, notably around Adelaide and the outskirts of Melbourne, while cases in New South Wales and Western Australia have been more distributed.

5|$|In these diseases, {{antibodies}} {{are mainly}} directed against {{two of the}} proteins of the complex, called PM/Scl-100 (the RNase D like protein) and PM/Scl-75 (one of the RNase PH like proteins from the ring) and antibodies recognizing these proteins are found in approximately 30% of patients with the PM/Scl overlap syndrome. Although these two proteins are the main target of the autoantibodies, other exosome subunits and associated proteins (like C1D) can be targeted in these <b>patients.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> current time, the most sensitive way to detect these antibodies is by using a peptide, derived from the PM/Scl-100 protein, as the antigen in an ELISA, instead of complete proteins. By this method, autoantibodies are found in up to 55% of patients with the PM/Scl overlap syndrome, {{but they can also}} be detected in patients suffering from either scleroderma, polymyositis, or dermatomyositis alone.|$|E
