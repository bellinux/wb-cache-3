However, high-quality counseling supervision {{may not always}} be available to practitioners when they need it most. <b>Peer</b> <b>supervision</b> is a method of counseling supervision which can be a viable alternative to traditional methods of supervision. Through <b>peer</b> <b>supervision,</b> student development professionals can work together to share a supervision arrangement with one or two of their colleagues without benefit of an "expert" supervisor.

The <b>Peer</b> Assisted <b>Supervision</b> and Support (PASS) <b>supervision</b> model uses <b>peer</b> relationships to promote the self-regulatory capacity of practitioners to improve intervention delivery.

A Q-methodology approach was used to generate data and 30 practitioners volunteered to participate in the study. Data were analyzed and interpreted using standard Q-methodology procedures and by-person factor analysis yielded three factors. There was consensus that PASS was acceptable. Participants shared the view that PASS facilitated an environment of support where negative aspects of interpersonal relationships that might develop in supervision were not evident. Two factors represented the viewpoint that PASS was also a feasible model of supervision. However, the third factor was comprised of practitioners who reported that PASS could be time consuming and difficult to fit into existing work demands. There were differences across the three factors in the extent to which practitioners considered PASS impacted on their intervention delivery.

Methods: We costed the peer support intervention, which was offered to 406 breastfeeding mothers in Uganda. The average number of counselling visits was about 6 per woman. Annual financial and economic costs were collected in 2005 - 2008. Estimates were made of total project costs, average costs per mother counselled and average costs per peer counselling visit.

40|$|Background: Implementation of new {{effective}} treatments involves training, {{supervision and}} quality control of therapists, {{who are used}} to utilize other methods. Not much is known about therapists’ views on how new psychotherapy methods should be taught. Objective: The {{purpose of this study is}} to get insight in how experienced therapists experience the training in a new method so that training methods for experienced therapists can be improved. Method: Qualitative research using focus groups. For an RCT on the effectiveness of schema therapy (ST) for six personality disorders more than 80 therapists were trained in ST. They applied the ST-protocol after 4 -day training, with <b>peer</b> <b>supervision</b> and limited expert supervision. Sixteen of these trained ST therapists from seven health institutions participated in the focus groups. The transcripts and records of the focus groups were analyzed on repeating themes and subthemes and in terms of higher order categories. Results: Therapists appreciated didactical learning methods but particularly valued experiential learning. Especially, novice ST therapists missed role plays, feedback to learn required skills and attitudes, and attention to their resistance to new techniques (e. g., empathic confrontation and imagery). <b>Peer</b> <b>supervision</b> gave emotional recognition, but therapists lacked regular advice from an ST-expert. Conclusions: In teaching a new therapeutic method didactic teaching is necessary, but experiential learning is decisive. Experiential learning includes practicing the new therapy and reflecting on one’s experiences, including resistance against new methods. Emphatic confrontation, case conceptualization, role play, <b>peer</b> <b>supervision</b> and opportunities to ask an expert supervisor during <b>peer</b> <b>supervision</b> are found to be helpful...|$|E
40|$|The {{value of}} {{supervision}} {{is such that}} regular professional supervision is required by the Australian Association of Social Workers {{for social workers to}} maintain Accredited Status. Whilst many workplaces provide supervision, in some organizations and particularly in rural and remote locations, social workers may have difficulty accessing professional supervision due to the isolated positions they hold. Two recent Australian state Health Department studies looking at recruitment and retention of professionals in remote areas (Cuss, 2005) and (Symons, 2005) both cite the lack of professional supervision and opportunities for professional development as the main contributing factors to high staff turnover. This paper reports on the findings of a research project that is a qualitative, action research study looking at the experience of social work <b>peer</b> <b>supervision</b> in small groups using technology (phone and video links). Social work volunteers in regional, rural and remote areas of Australia participated in <b>peer</b> <b>supervision</b> groups once a month for 12 months from Jul 2006 - Jul 2007 and evaluated their experiences with monthly evaluations (on-line) and focus groups {{at the conclusion of the}} trial.

Participants included 821 youth from the Longitudinal Cohort Study of the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN) data set. Data include primary caregiver and youth self-report measures of adult <b>supervision,</b> <b>peer</b> associations, and substance use. Data also include community survey and systematic social observation measures of neighborhood social processes such as collective efficacy, social disorder and social capital, neighborhood disadvantage, policing, and perceived danger collected from 1994 - 2001 in the city of Chicago. Latent growth curve modeling analyses were used to answer the research questions. Study results were significant associations between neighborhood social processes and substance use. Contrary to previous findings, more positive neighborhood social processes were related to higher levels of substance use for females. For both the African American/Black and Hispanic/Latino groups, deviant peer associations were related to higher levels of substance use at age 12. For the Hispanic/Latino group, higher neighborhood socioeconomic status was related to greater increases in substance use over time. Study results suggest the continued importance of research to discover sex and ethnic variation in associations among contextual influences and adolescent substance use. The current study makes a significant contribution to extant literature by examining the influence of neighborhood social processes, deviant <b>peer</b> associations, and <b>supervision</b> on substance use trajectories. Including peers, parental, and neighborhood factors&mdashin one model&mdashprovided a more comprehensive examination of how contextual influences impact the development of adolescent substance use.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} was to explore the {{resource}} and management issues in introducing and maintaining a clinical supervision programme for nurses. A number of federal, state and non-governmental agency reports have recently indicted the quality of present-day mental health service provision in Australia.
