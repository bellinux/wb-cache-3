The Missouri Supreme Court held that the trial court had standing to impose security measures if it was necessary. The Supreme Court of Missouri stated that Deck had committed murder and that he would run if he had the chance. Additionally, the court ruled that there was “no record of the extent of the jury’s awareness of the restraints throughout the penalty phase.” [...] The Missouri Supreme Court concluded by stating that it was not claimed that the shackles prevented Deck from participating in the trial and that no evidence has been put forth to prove that it did.|$|E

The book was reviled at the time, with Senator Robert Byrd quoting extensively from it in his speech supporting the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996, an overwhelming, bipartisan rebuke to the marriage movement. Ultimately, many state courts and the U.S. Supreme Court (Obergefell v. Hodges (2015)) adopted these arguments in favor of gay marriage.

The findings show that the positive association between board independence and voluntary disclosure only occurs in those countries with high investor <b>protection</b> <b>rights.</b> The findings emphasize the need to consider the legal and institutional setting explicitly when analysing the effect of corporate governance on voluntary disclosure. ...|$|R

Using balance sheet information for around 500 commercial banks from more than 50 countries averaged over 2005 - 2007, we find that concentrated ownership (proxied by different levels of shareholding) significantly reduces a bank's non-performing loans ratio, conditional on supervisory control and shareholders <b>protection</b> <b>rights.</b> Furthermore, ownership concentration affects the capital adequacy ratio positively conditional on shareholder protection. At low levels of shareholder <b>protection</b> <b>rights</b> and supervisory control, ownership concentration reduces bank riskiness. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|A Research {{proposal}} submitted in partial {{fulfillment of}} the Bachelor of laws degreeThe {{right to be forgotten}} is a data <b>protection</b> <b>right</b> that enables an individual to have personal data concerning themselves removed from the internet. Data Protection laws in Kenya are insufficient. The Data Protection Bill which was first drafted in 2008 is yet to be enacted in 2016. The internet has today become an important tool for many Kenyans that is used everyday yet there are insufficient laws to protect the data that they leave on the internet. In this paper I seek to determine whether Kenya should adopt the right to be forgotten. I examine the data protection laws in other countries to examine what a data <b>protection</b> <b>right</b> should entail. Then I look at the proposed right to be forgotten legislation and why the right to be forgotten is an important right. Finally I examine the situation in Kenya and find {{that there is a need}} for better Data Protection laws; even the right to be forgotten upon examination of the Data Protection Bill is insufficient. Not only do they not provide for the right to be forgotten or the right to erasure, it also fails to establish a regulatory authority to ensure compliance with the legislation. For these reasons I recommend that the Data Protection Bill should be amended to include the right to be forgotten and a proper regulatory authority should be set up under the Act. I also recommend that Data Protection should be a concern for the law makers who should amend the Bill and pass it...|$|E

Therefore, as public policy, cultural policy has an undisputed impact on urban/rural areas/territories, at least according to the authorities’ intention to correct some discrepances as regards the number and location of cultural services in the community area, their equipping, easy access of inhabitants to cultural institutions, the density and representativity of the cultural life itself...|$|E
