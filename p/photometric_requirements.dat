40|$|This {{publication}} gives explanatory {{comments on}} the Dutch standard NEN 3322 "Road traffic control light signals. <b>Photometric</b> <b>requirements</b> and test methods", published in December 1972. After a general introduction in chapter 1, chapter 2 deals with the fundamental aspects that were used as a basis when drawing up the requirements for chromaticity coordinates, luminous intensities and luminous intensity distributions, the limitation of the phantom effect, and optical systems presenting a symbolic appearance e. g. green-red arrows and crosses, pedestrians and bicycles. In chapter 3 some aspects are discussed of the locating and directioning of light signals. Some aspects of the construction and maintenance of light signals are discussed in chapter 4. Finally, chapter 5 deals with the test methods of light signals for luminous intensities, limitation of the phantom effect and the colours of the signals...|$|E
40|$|During this Master’s thesis at the Vision Institute (Paris, France), a noncontact {{optical system}} for in vivo {{combined}} imaging and patterned {{stimulation of the}} rodent eye was developed. The objective {{was to assess the}} efficiency of the optogenetic therapy, currently tested on rodents, whose aim is to heal blind or low-visual-acuity people. To the best of our knowledge, previous systems did not reach the photometric requirement needed for the stimulation of optogenetic channels and were developed for bigger mammals than rodents. The mounted system allowed us to obtain non-contact mouse and rat eye fundi images with a wide field in both near-infrared and visible illumination. The first tests of the patterned stimulation arm allowed projection of simple patterns on the rat eye and showed that the <b>photometric</b> <b>requirements</b> are almost met for the activation of optogenetic channels. Future developments should include stable alignment of the animal’s eye with the optical axis of the system, which would result in an improved quality of eye fundus images and of the patterned stimulation...|$|E

40|$|We {{study in}} detail the <b>photometric</b> {{redshift}} <b>requirements</b> needed for tomographic weak gravitational lensing {{in order to measure}} accurately the Dark Energy equation of state. In particular, we examine how ground-based photometry (u,g,r,i,z,y) can be complemented by space-based near-infrared (IR) photometry (J,H), e. g. on board the planned DUNE satellite. Using realistic photometric redshift simulations and an artificial neural network photo-z method we evaluate the Figure of Merit for the Dark Energy parameters $(w_ 0, w_a) $. We consider a DUNE-like broad optical filter supplemented with ground-based multi-band optical data from surveys like the Dark Energy Survey, Pan-STARRS and LSST. We show that the Dark Energy Figure of Merit would improved by a factor of 1. 3 to 1. 7 if IR filters are added on board DUNE. Furthermore we show that with IR data catastrophic photo-z outliers can be removed effectively. There is an interplay between the choice of filters, the magnitude limits and the removal of outliers. We draw attention to the dependence of the results on the galaxy formation scenarios encoded into the mock galaxies, e. g the galaxy reddening. For example, deep u band data could be as effective as the IR. We also find that about $ 10 ^ 5 - 10 ^ 6 $ spectroscopic redshifts are needed for calibration of the full survey.

40|$|The Kepler {{mission will}} launch in 2007 and {{determine}} the distribution of earth-size planets (0. 5 to 10 earth masses) in the habitable zones (HZs) of solar-like stars. The mission will monitor > 100, 000 dwarf stars simultaneously for at least 4 years. Precision differential photometry {{will be used to}} detect the periodic signals of transiting planets. Kepler will also support asteroseismology by measuring the pressure-mode (p-mode) oscillations of selected stars. Key mission elements include a spacecraft bus and 0. 95 meter, wide-field, CCD-based photometer injected into an earth-trailing heliocentric orbit by a 3 -stage Delta II launch vehicle as well as a distributed Ground Segment and Follow-up Observing Program. The project is currently preparing for Preliminary Design Review (October 2004) and is proceeding with detailed design and procurement of long-lead components. In order to meet the unprecedented <b>photometric</b> precision <b>requirement</b> and to ensure a statistically significant result, the Kepler mission involves technical challenges in the areas of photometric noise and systematic error reduction, stability, and false-positive rejection. Programmatic and logistical challenges include the collaborative design, modeling, integration, test, and operation of a geographically and functionally distributed project. A very rigorous systems engineering program has evolved to address these challenges. This paper provides an overview of the Kepler systems engineering program, including some examples of our processes and techniques in areas such as requirements synthesis, validation & verification, system robustness design, and end-to-end performance modeling...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the issues strictly {{connected with the}} scientific discipline of Transport, concerning the exploitation of lighting devices, reflectors and projectors being the fundamental devices for tram’s head lighting. The factor influencing {{the safety of a}} moving track vehicle is the quality and state of tram’s head lighting. Appropriate light distribution within the area of tram’s foreground plays a decisive role in the perception of luminous sensations by the tram driver. A properly shaped light beam conditions appropriate visibility from the tram driver’s seat and facilitates correct assessment of traffic situations connected with the behaviour of other road traffic participants. The history of development of lighting devices for head lights used for trams has been discussed. The article proposes and discusses application of AFS system in trams particularly accounting for proposals of new lighting requirements for tram’s head lighting devices. Particular {{attention has been paid to}} <b>photometric</b> <b>requirements</b> for projectors and reflectors of tram’s head lights, presenting proposals for these requirements. After conducting a lighting analysis of currently exploited light beams it has been established that justification exists for using symmetrical light beams in the case of head, main and low beam lights.

40|$|Current <b>photometric</b> <b>requirements</b> {{for some}} signal lamps in the U. S. are based om {{the number of}} &quot;ligfited {{sections}} &quot; that comprise the lamp intensity requirements are somewhat higher for lamps with more sections, partially adjusting for the presumably larger lighted area of a lamp with more sections, and thereby establishing some control of luminance. The number of sections {{is used as a}} proxy for area, {{based on the assumption that}} lamps will be constructed with optical units of a certain approximate size, each with a single incandescent bulb of relatively high candle power. However, recently there has been growing interest in, and in some cases use of, a greater variety of sources for signal lamps, including LEDs, neon tubes, miniature halogen bulbs, and distributive light sources. The relationship between number of lighted sections and surface area that could be assumed for lamps with relatively large incandescent bulbs cannot be extended to the new sources. Therefore the way in which photometric standards address the areas or luminances of signal lamps must be reassessed. This document reviews the existing research that is relevant to the roles of lighted sections and area in signal-lamp performance, presents the findings from a new experiment, and offer...|$|E
40|$|Mobile {{technology}} is increasingly {{used to measure}} visual acuity. Standards for chart-based acuity tests specify <b>photometric</b> <b>requirements</b> for luminance, optotype contrast and luminance uniformity. Manufacturers provide some photometric data but {{little is known about}} tablet performance for visual acuity testing. This study photometrically characterised seven tablet computers (iPad, Apple inc.) and three ETDRS (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study) visual acuity charts with room lights on and off, and compared findings with visual acuity measurement standards. Tablet screen luminance and contrast were measured using nine points across a black and white checkerboard test screen at five arbitrary brightness levels. ETDRS optotypes and adjacent white background luminance and contrast were measured. All seven tablets (room lights off) exceeded the most stringent requirement for mean luminance (≥ 120 cd/m 2) providing the nominal brightness setting was above 50 %. All exceeded contrast requirement (Weber ≥ 90 %) regardless of brightness setting, and five were marginally below the required luminance uniformity threshold (Lmin/Lmax ≥ 80 %). Re-assessing three tablets with room lights on made little difference to mean luminance or contrast, and improved luminance uniformity to exceed the threshold. The three EDTRS charts (room lights off) had adequate mean luminance (≥ 120 cd/m 2) and Weber contrast (≥ 90 %), but all three charts failed to meet the luminance uniformity standard (Lmin/Lmax ≥ 80 %). Two charts were operating beyond manufacturer’s recommended lamp replacement schedule. With room lights on, chart mean luminance and Weber contrast increased, but two charts still had inadequate luminance uniformity. Tablet computers showed less inter-device variability, higher contrast, and better luminance uniformity than charts in both lights-on and lights-off environments, providing brightness setting was > 50 %. Overall, iPad tablets matched or marginally out-performed ETDRS charts in terms of photometric compliance with high contrast acuity standards...|$|E
40|$|We {{conduct a}} {{detailed}} analysis of the <b>photometric</b> redshift <b>requirements</b> for the proposed Dark Energy Survey (DES) using two sets of mock galaxy simulations and an artificial neural network code-ANNz. In particular, we examine how optical photometry in the DES grizY bands can be complemented with near infra-red photometry from the planned VISTA Hemisphere Survey (VHS) in the JHK{sub s} bands in order to improve the photometric redshift estimate by a factor of two at z > 1. We draw attention to the effects of galaxy formation scenarios such as reddening on the photo-z estimate and using our neural network code, calculate A{sub v} for these reddened galaxies. We also look at the impact of using different training sets when calculating photometric redshifts. In particular, we find that using the ongoing DEEP 2 and VVDS-Deep spectroscopic surveys to calibrate photometric redshifts for DES, will prove effective. However we {{need to be aware of}} uncertainties in the photometric redshift bias that arise when using different training sets as these will translate into errors in the dark energy equation of state parameter, w. Furthermore, we show that the neural network error estimate on the photometric redshift may be used to remove outliers from our samples before any kind of cosmological analysis, in particular for large-scale structure experiments. By removing all galaxies with a 1 {sigma} photo-z scatter greater than 0. 1 from our DES+VHS sample, we can constrain the galaxy power spectrum out to a redshift of 2 and reduce the fractional error on this power spectrum by {approx} 15 - 20 % compared to using the entire catalogue...|$|R

40|$|Photo-generated {{charge in}} thick, back-illuminated, fully-depleted CCDs is transported by {{electric}} fields from the silicon substrate to the collecting {{well at the}} front gate of the CCDs. However, electric fields transverse {{to the surface of}} the CCD -with diverse origins such as doping gradients, guard rings around the imaging area of the sensor, and physical stresses on the silicon lattice- displace this charge, effectively modifying the pixel area and producing noticeable signals in astrometric and photometric measurements. We use data from the science verification period of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) to characterize these effects in the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) CCDs. The transverse fields mainly manifest as concentric rings ("tree rings") and bright stripes near the boundaries of the detectors ("edge distortions") with relative amplitudes of about 1 % and 10 % in the flat-field images, respectively. Their nature as pixel size variations is confirmed by comparing their photometric and astrometric signatures. Using flat-field images from DECam, we derive templates in the five DES photometric bands (grizY) for the tree rings and the edge distortions as a function of their position in each DECam detector. These templates can be directly incorporated into the derivation of photometric and astrometric solutions, helping to meet the DES <b>photometric</b> and astrometric <b>requirements.</b> Comment: Accepted for publication in the Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific (PASP, issue August 2014...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-Detecting changes between {{images of}} the same scene taken at {{different}} times is of great interest for monitoring and understanding the environment. It is widely used for on-land application but suffers from different constraints. Unfortunately, Change detection algorithms require highly accurate geometric and <b>photometric</b> registration. This <b>requirement</b> has precluded their use in underwater imagery in the past. In this paper, the change detection techniques available nowa-days for on-land application were analyzed and a method to automatically detect the changes in sequences of underwater images is proposed. Target application scenarios are habitat restoration sites, or area monitoring after sudden impacts from hurricanes or ship groundings. The method {{is based on the}} creation of a 3 D terrain model from one image sequence over an area of interest. This model allows for synthesizing textured views that correspond to the same viewpoints of a second image sequence. The generated views are photometrically matched and corrected against the corresponding frames from the second sequence. Standard change detection techniques are then applied to find areas of difference. Additionally, the paper shows {{that it is possible to}} detect false positives, resulting from non-rigid objects, by applying the same change detection method to the first sequence exclusively. The developed method was able to correctly find the changes between two challenging sequences of images from a coral reef taken one year apart and acquired with two different cameras. I...|$|R
