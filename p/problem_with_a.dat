5|$|Apollonius {{problem is}} to {{construct}} one or more circles tangent to three given objects in a plane, which may be circles, points, or lines. This gives rise to ten types of Apollonius' problem, one corresponding to each combination of circles, lines and points, which may be labeled with three letters, either C, L, or P, to denote whether the given elements are a circle, line or point, respectively (Table 1). As an example, the type of Apollonius <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> given circle, line, and point is denoted as CLP.|$|E

5|$|The {{homomorphism}} <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> fixed graph H on {{the right}} side of each instance is also called the H-coloring problem.

In an open-format competition, all climbers compete simultaneously, and are given a fixed {{amount of time to}} complete as many problems as possible.

40|$|Many Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) {{have been}} {{proposed}} in recent years. However, almost all MOEAs have been evaluated on <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> two to four objectives only. It is unclear how well these MOEAs will perform on <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> large number of objectives. Our preliminary study [1] showed that performance of some MOEAs deteriorates significantly {{as the number of}} objectives increases. This paper proposes a new MOEA that performs well on <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> large number of objectives. The new algorithm separates non-dominated solutions into two archives, and is thus called the Two-Archive algorithm. The two archives focused on convergence and diversity, respectively, in optimisation. Computational studies have been carried out to evaluate and compare our new algorithm against the best MOEA for <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> large number of objectives. Our experimental results have shown that the Two-Archive algorithm outperforms existing MOEAs on <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> large number of objectives. ...|$|R

5|$|Other notable {{performances}} {{came from}} Berger, {{who took the}} final podium position despite being delayed {{during one of his}} routine pit stops due to a <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> loose wheel nut; Mika Häkkinen, who finished fourth for the McLaren team despite its new car proving to be uncompetitive in pre-season testing; and Mika Salo, who drove strongly {{in the first half of}} the race to run third in his first Grand Prix for the Tyrrell team, only to suffer from a cramp and drop back to seventh place at the finish. Behind Häkkinen, the other points-scoring finishers were Jean Alesi in the second Ferrari and Mark Blundell, who drove the second McLaren. Blundell was standing in for regular driver Nigel Mansell in the second McLaren until the team could produce a wider chassis in which to accommodate him, as the car's initial cockpit design had proved to be too narrow for him to drive comfortably.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{applications}} of 2-satisfiability {{have been made}} for other geometric placement problems. In graph drawing, if the vertex locations are fixed and each edge must be drawn as a circular arc with one of two possible locations (for instance as an arc diagram), then the problem of choosing which arc to use for each edge {{in order to avoid}} crossings is a 2-satisfiability <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> variable for each edge and a constraint for each pair of placements that would lead to a crossing. However, in this case it is possible to speed up the solution, compared to an algorithm that builds and then searches an explicit representation of the implication graph, by searching the graph implicitly.|$|E
