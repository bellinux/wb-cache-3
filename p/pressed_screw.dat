Due {{to the increase}} in demand for fuel and stringent emission norms, biodiesel is preferred as it meets the emission norms. To meet the exponentially growing demands in developing countries, continuous production is required which can be achieved by mechanical <b>screw</b> <b>presses.</b> Currently, single <b>screw</b> <b>press</b> is being widely used for extraction of oil. The problems associated with the single screw expeller is that, it requires three or more passes to expel oil from seeds, which increases the production time and are also less efficient.

Each machine imparted a different nominal strain rate during the deformation. The final forgings were done at the warm working (low hot working) temperatures of 816 â—¦C, 843 â—¦C, and 871 â—¦C. The objectives {{of the study were}} to characterize and understand the effect of industrial strain rates (i. e. processing equipment), and deformation temperature on the mechanical properties for the final component. Some of the components were produced with an anneal prior to the final forging while others were deformed without the anneal. The results indicate that lower strain rates produced lower strength and higher ductility components, but the lower strain rate processes were more sensitive to deformation temperature variation and resulted in more within-part property variation. The highest strain rate process, HERF, resulted in slightly lower yield strength due to internal heating. Lower processing temperatures increased strength, decreased ductility but decreased within-part property variation. The anneal prior to the final forging produced a decrease in strength, a small increase in ductility, and a small decrease of within-part property variation...|$|R

40|$|This Licentiate thesis {{deals with}} {{small-scale}} extraction of {{rape seed oil}} {{and the use of}} this oil in an Elsbett engine tractor. Small-scale extraction of rape seed oil was studied in practical tests in the laboratory at Ultuna, Uppsala. The influence of the speed of the <b>press</b> <b>screw,</b> nozzle size and nozzle performance, the distance between the <b>press</b> <b>screw</b> and the <b>press</b> chamber head, the ambient temperature, and preheating of the seed with air was studied. At SjÃ¶sa farm a small plant for on-farm extraction of rape seed oil was built. The processing of three bigger batches of oil seed was studied. Data of interest were registered in an operating log. Capacity and oil extraction efficiency were studied. A tractor with an Elsbett engine was operated at SjÃ¶sa farm on the processed rape seed oil. Data of interest were registered in an operating log and with an automatic data collection system. The data obtained on the farm were used to conduct an energy analysis. The oil press has higher capacity with bigger nozzles and higher screw speeds. However, the amount of oil extracted from each seed increased if the nozzles were smaller and/or the <b>press</b> <b>screw</b> speed was lower. Nozzles with a long press nozzle channel gave a more solid meal. It was important that the temperature in the press chamber head reached a temperature of about 70 Â°C. The optimum seed moisture content (wet basis) was 7 - 8 per cent. Preheating with air usually improved the capacity, but there is a risk of over-drying so it must be done with care. Preheated seed involves a risk of getting too high levels of phosphorus in the oil. On the farm, the simplest way of cleaning the oil is settling. This can be done in three series-coupled sedimentation tanks. If the ambient temperature is + 20 Â°C and the settling height is 0. 6 m, about 18 days are needed for the settling. A tractor with an Elsbett engine can be operated almost {{in the same way as}} a conventional tractor. The differences are rape seed oil fuel, separate starting fuel, more frequent fuel filter exchange, electrical heating of the fuel system and about 10 per cent higher fuel consumption. Problems may occur when the rape seed oil stiffens at - 15 Â°C. To obtain a good energy balance it is important to have a high yield and low moisture contents. It is important also to have uses for the meal and straw. Direct seeding also improves the energy balance. The main conclusion of the project is that a system involving rape seed oil and the Elsbett engine works well technically. The system is not, however, competitive as there are cheap fossil fuels on the market, and the Elsbett engine has not yet entered serial production. In addition, the supply of rape seed oil in Sweden is limited, and the oil produced could be used for better purposes than as vehicle fuel...|$|R
