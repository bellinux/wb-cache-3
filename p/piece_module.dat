40|$|By {{combining}} microfluidics and soft-lithographic molding of gels containing mammalian cells, {{a device}} for three-dimensional (3 D) culture of mammalian cells in microchannels was developed. Native {{components of the}} extracellular matrix, including collagen or MatrigelTM, made up the matrix of each molded <b>piece</b> (<b>module)</b> of cell-containing gel. Each module {{had at least one}} dimension below ∼ 300 lm; in modules of these sizes, the flux of oxygen, nutrients, and metabolic products {{into and out of the}} modules was sufficient to allow cells in the modules to proliferate to densities comparable to those of native tissue (108 – 109 cells cm− 3). Packing modules loosely into microfluidic channels and chambers yielded structures permeated with a network of pores through which cell culture medium could flow to feed the encapsulated cells. The order in the packed assemblies increased as the width of the microchannels approached the width of the modules. Multiple cell types could be spatially organized in the small microfluidic channels. Recovery and analysis of modules after 24 h under constant flow of medium (200 lL h− 1) showed that over 99 % of encapsulated cells survived this interval in the microfluidic chamber...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Support for {{modularity}} allows complex ontologies to {{be separated}} into smaller <b>pieces</b> (<b>modules)</b> that are easier to maintain and compute. Instead of considering the entire complex ontology, users may bene t more by starting from a problem-speci c set of concepts (signature of problem) from the ontology and exploring its surrounding logical modules. Additionally, an ontology modularization mechanism allows for the splitting up of ontologies into modules that can be processed by isolated separate instances of the inference engine. The relational algorithm, described in this paper, {{makes it possible to}} construct an inference engine that can run in a highly scalable cloud computing environment, or on a computer grid. ...|$|R

We put emphasis on the <b>piece</b> selection <b>module</b> of server-side, and in this part we cite the RF-IPS algorithm proposed in the past. In the <b>piece</b> selection <b>module,</b> we also proposed a weighting function except the RF-IPS algorithm. Using this function we will find the best server peers effectively and quickly, it will enhance the performance of this system. We carry on experiments on RF-IPS algorithm, and the results show this algorithm is efficient.

40|$|International audienceProgramming large systems {{requires}} to {{cut them}} in smaller <b>pieces</b> (<b>modules,</b> objects, components, agents, [...] .). In all but trivial cases, choices must be made about {{what will be the}} pieces, and some aspects are inevitably spread out over several parts. In Object-Oriented Programming, these have been identified as "Crosscutting Concerns", and Aspect-Oriented Programming is about a reunification of these transversal aspects of the system. In multi-agent programming, one of the crosscutting concerns is interaction. In this paper, we present a multi-agent model that allows to design agents and interation patterns independently, as first-order objects, and combine them at runtime. The result is a two-dimensional, orthogonal approach of multi-agent systems. This model features a very flexible agent architecture due to its componential nature. It is targeted towards independance of agents and of interaction patterns, hence increasing their reusability. The model is formalized in an Object-Z/Statechart mixed formalism, and fully implemented in Java...|$|R
40|$|Arguably, {{the most}} bizarre {{mitochondrial}} DNA (mtDNA) {{is that of the}} euglenozoan eukaryote Diplonema papillatum. The genome consists of numerous small circular chromosomes none of which appears to encode a complete gene. For instance, the cox 1 coding sequence is spread out over nine different chromosomes in non-overlapping <b>pieces</b> (<b>modules),</b> which are transcribed separately and joined to a contiguous mRNA by trans-splicing. Here, we examine how many genes are encoded by Diplonema mtDNA and whether all are fragmented and their transcripts trans-spliced. Module identification is challenging due to the sequence divergence of Diplonema mitochondrial genes. By employing most sensitive protein profile search algorithms and comparing genomic with cDNA sequence, we recognize a total of 11 typical mitochondrial genes. The 10 protein-coding genes are systematically chopped up into three to 12 modules of 60 – 350 [*]bp length. The corresponding mRNAs are all trans-spliced. Identification of ribosomal RNAs is most difficult. So far, we only detect the 3 ′-module of the large subunit ribosomal RNA (rRNA); it does not trans-splice with other pieces. The small subunit rRNA gene remains elusive. Our results open new intriguing questions about the biochemistry and evolution of mitochondrial trans-splicing in Diplonema...|$|R
40|$|Mitochondrial ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) often display reduced {{size and}} deviant {{secondary}} structure, and sometimes are fragmented, as are their correspond-ing genes. Here we report a mitochondrial large subunit rRNA (mt-LSU rRNA) with unprecedented features. In the protist Diplonema, the rnl gene is {{split into two}} <b>pieces</b> (<b>modules</b> 1 and 2, 534 - and 352 -nt long) that are encoded by distinct mitochon-drial chromosomes, yet the rRNA is continuous. To reconstruct the post-transcriptional maturation pathway of this rRNA, we have catalogued transcript intermediates by deep RNA sequencing and RT-PCR. Gene modules are transcribed separately. Subsequently, transcripts are end-processed, the module- 1 transcript is polyuridylated and the module- 2 transcript is polyadenylated. The two modules are joined via trans-splicing that retains at the junction 26 uridines, resulting in an extent of insertion RNA editing not observed before in any system. The A-tail of trans-spliced molecules is shorter than that of mono-module 2, and completely absent from mitoribosome-associated mt-LSU rRNA. We also characterize putative antisense transcripts. Antisense-mono-modules corroborate bi-directional transcription of chromosomes. Antisense-mt-LSU rRNA, if functional, {{has the potential of}} guiding concomitantly trans-splicing and editing of this rRNA. Together, these findings open a window on the investigation of complex regulatory networks that orchestrate multiple and biochemically diverse post-transcriptional events...|$|R

For each operator, we give its syntactic construction rule, define its set-theoretic meaning, and also examine its algebraic properties, all illustrated with examples where appropriate. Our work can shed light on the design of future CSP-based module system...|$|R

Taking the concept further, he introduced “nuclear furniture”—which included occasional tables with interchangeable pedestals, in different shapes and sizes that could, like seating, be clustered in varying configurations. In the 1960s, he extended the idea to case goods, making it possible to offer many variations on one basic design… the same case was available in a choice of finishes, legs, bases, heights, and hardware. Differences that were cosmetic rather than conceptual were economical to produce—evidence that Probber’s business acumen matched his design ability.|$|R
40|$|Interactive {{programming}} is a convenient programming style that supports fast prototyping and debugging but {{often results in}} a loss of modularity and security. This article addresses the problem of supporting reliable and modular interactive programming. A module system designed for interactive use is introduced. This module system supports separate compilation and automatic updating of module interfaces during program development. It also allows the programmer to obtain a fresh program state for reliable testing, eliminating the need to reload an entire program. 1.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the architecture of a shogi processor based on recongurable hardware. For our implementation, we have used Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), which can be recongured dynamically by downloading conguration data from host computers. Because of this reconguration exibility, {{it is possible to}} implement and evaluate new algorithms quickly and to make small subsystems (of very low cost) that can be used on demand. For shogi these two features are especially important, as there are no stable subsystems that can be ported to special purpose hardware. Also, in shogi dierent modules are needed for dierent stages of the game. To test the feasibility of using FPGAs for shogi, we have implemented two modules that are general for all strong shogi programs on one o-the-shelf PCI board with one FPGA.

While flat modules are those modules which leave short exact sequences exact after tensoring, a pure submodule defines a short exact sequence that remains exact after tensoring with any module. Similarly a flat module is a direct limit of projective modules, and a pure submodule defines a short exact sequence which is a direct limit of split exact sequences, each defined by a direct summand.|$|R

40|$|AbstractGiven a (not {{necessarily}} regular) rational {{matrix function}} W and a subset σ {{of the extended}} complex plane, we associate with it a free module lσ(W) over the ring of scalar rational functions which are analytic on σ, called the null-pole subspace of W over σ. In the scalar case, the information encoded in this module {{is equivalent to the}} knowledge of all the poles and zeros, including their multiplicities, at all points of σ; in the general matrix case, the null-pole subspace encodes the more complicated zero-pole structure of a rational matrix function, which is the key tool for the understanding of many factorization problems. In this paper we show how various other modules which have been introduced in the literature in connection with pole-zero structure (e. g. pole module, zero module) can be read off from the null-pole subspace, and how, conversely, the null-pole subspace can be recovered from its various <b>pieces</b> (pole <b>module,</b> null module, a null-pole coupling operator and left annihilator). We give an analytic, coordinate-dependent description of these modules which has connection with realization theory and which is useful for computations.

40|$|Given a graded $E_ 1 $-module over an $E_ 2 $-algebra in spaces, we {{construct}} an augmented semi-simplicial space up to higher coherent homotopy over it, called its canonical resolution, whose graded connectivity yields homological stability for the graded <b>pieces</b> of the <b>module</b> {{with respect to}} constant and abelian coefficients. We furthermore introduce a notion of coefficient systems of finite degree in this context and show that, without further assumptions, the corresponding twisted homology groups stabilize as well. This generalizes a framework of Randal-Williams and Wahl for families of discrete groups. In many examples, the canonical resolution recovers geometric resolutions with known connectivity bounds. As a consequence, we derive new twisted homological stability results for e. g. moduli spaces of high-dimensional manifolds, unordered configuration spaces of manifolds with labels in a fibration, and moduli spaces of manifolds equipped with unordered embedded discs. This in turn implies representation stability for the ordered variants of the latter examples. Comment: 40 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{commentary}} {{deals with}} the two principal areas of my compositional work from 1996 - 2003 : short pieces and modularity. Taking a survey of compositional durations as a starting point, assumptions related to duration {{are discussed in the}} context of extremely long and short pieces by Feldman, Jliat, Webern and Werder. The effect of duration on form, structure, listening and the practicalities of performance is considered in relation to memory and our perception of duration, suggesting a range of possible solutions to the problem of composing short pieces. These issues are examined in the context of my own work in composing short pieces (1996 - 2000), leading to a consideration of an effective performance practice and the transition to the use of short <b>pieces</b> as <b>modules</b> in a larger compositional framework. The consequent development of a fully modular approach to music is contextualised through an examination of modular theory in a manufacturing context, leading to analysis of a range of examples of modular and open form work in literature, visual art and music. Differences between open and closed forms of modularity are explored along with the effect of a modular approach on creative work. These theoretical and practical issues are discussed in relation to my modular composition #[unassigned] (2000 -), surveying its development from groups of short pieces. The compositional method is explained, examining the creation of a modular interface and types of modules and their re-use, through examples of existing versions.

40|$|Project (M. S., Electrical and Electronic Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2012. A {{stethoscope}} is {{a primary}} device used by medical doctors. It is used {{to listen to a}} patient???s heart and lung sounds. Acoustic, electronic, and wireless stethoscopes are commercially available. A problem with the acoustic and electronic stethoscopes is that harmful germs can be spread to other patients as the doctor uses the same stethoscope from patient to patient. Also, the doctors may get infected with the germs as they sit close to the patients they are examining. A wireless stethoscope, consisting of a chest piece and a separate head set, can be used to reduce the spread of germs, because the doctors do not have to sit as close to the patients as when using the acoustic or electronic stethoscopes. But due to their cost, they are rarely used, and patients are still in danger of getting infected as the doctors use the same chest <b>piece</b> (transmitter <b>module)</b> from patient to patient. A lower-cost wireless stethoscope that is more affordable, allows providing a separate transmitter module to each patient, and perhaps allows the chest piece to be disposable, is proposed. The design requirements are that the device has to provide clear sound, have a range of wireless transmission of 10 - 15 feet, and have a cost lower than that of the wireless stethoscopes that are currently available in the market. The design uses a microphone, low voltage amplifiers, analog RF transmitter, analog RF receiver, and earphones. The microphone is a transducer that converts heart/lung sounds to an electrical signal. This converted electrical signal then is amplified and transmitted. The receiver receives the transmitted signal and then amplifies the signal. The amplified signal then is heard through earphones. The signal-to-noise ratio, frequency response, and cost of the design are compared to the existing acoustic, electronic and wireless stethoscopes. The device developed does not provide sound as clear as that of the electronic stethoscope, and the noise increases as the distance increases between the chest piece and the head set. The frequency response of the device is not satisfactory, as it is not flat for heart and lung sounds (30 ??? 1, 000 Hz). Without considering manufacturing costs, the cost of the device is less than the cost of the wireless stethoscope and less than the average cost of the electronic stethoscope but more than the average cost of the acoustic stethoscope.
