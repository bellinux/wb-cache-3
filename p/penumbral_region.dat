This value was higher than the value determined by Chumak and Chumak (1996) who used a similar method but for the <b>penumbral</b> <b>region</b> only for their sample set. There is a positive correlation r = 0. 58 between umbral and the penumbral fractal dimensions for the specific sunspots.

40|$|Multi-leaf penumbral doses {{have been}} {{investigated}} for 6 MV x-rays and a Varian millennium multi-leaf collimator (MLC) using Gafchromic MD- 55 - 2, radiochromic film and X-omat V radiographic film. An advantage of Gafchromic film for multi-leaf penumbral dose measurement is the relatively low energy dependence of the film. A comparison of penumbral dose measurements has also ascertained the effects of energy response on radiographic film in this region. Similar 80 %/ 20 % penumbral doses have been measured with both types of films. Thus there is a relatively low energy effect on penumbral dose measurements in film dosimetry. The 80 %/ 20 % dose penumbral distances for rounded leaf end multi-leafs for a 10 cm × 10 cm field at Dmax {{were found to be}} 4. 6 mm and 4. 3 mm for radiochromic and radiographic film respectively. This is compared to 2. 6 mm and 2. 6 mm for the leaf edge penumbra.

Bis(7) -tacrine administered intraperitoneally 15 min after ischemia dose-dependently improved neurological behavior deficits and reduced both cerebral infarct volume and edema. The TUNEL staining assay showed that bis(7) -tacrine attenuated neuronal apoptosis in the <b>penumbral</b> <b>region.</b> Compared with that for memantine, a moderately effective N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist with a similar affinity and potency to bis(7) -tacrine in blocking NMDA receptors, the therapeutic window for bis(7) -tacrine was wider and lasted up to 6 h after the onset of ischemia. Bis(7) -tacrine did not affect physiological parameters or regional cerebral blood flow during either the occlusion period or the early reperfusion stage.

Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured with laser-Doppler flowmetry in the penumbral cortex. Infarct size was evaluated 24 [*]h after MCA occlusion. The effects of these drugs on infarct size were examined by pretreatment of rats undergoing MCA occlusion. Pretreatment with cilostazol (100 [*]mg/kg) significantly reduced infarct size. In contrast, aspirin (10 [*]mg/kg) and clopidogrel (3 [*]mg/kg) failed to mitigate infarct size, regardless of their apparent inhibitory effects on platelet aggregation. Post-treatment with cilostazol also significantly attenuated the infarct size, associated with improved CBF in the <b>penumbral</b> <b>region.</b> In support of this effect, cilostazol increased nitric oxide (NO) production and prostaglandin-I 2 (PGI 2) release in cultured human brain microvascular endothelial cells.

METHODS: Diffusion-weighted and T 2 -weighted MR imaging were used in a feline global cerebral ischemia/reperfusion model. Single 30 -minute vascular occlusions followed by reperfusion were studied. Global occlusions were used to avoid interpretive complications associated with the temporally unstable hemodynamics of the penumbral zones around focal occlusions and the possible growth of the ischemic and <b>penumbral</b> <b>regions</b> with time. RESULTS: Diffusion-weighted hyperintensity and the associated diffusional slowing were not attributable exclusively to the cessation of blood flow because: 1) it does not appear abruptly at the onset of ischemia; 2) it resolves slowly early in reperfusion; and 3) it reappears after prolonged reperfusion. CONCLUSION: The times during which diffusion-weighted hyperintensity is manifested during ischemia, and recovers with reperfusion, point to a role for energy metabolism failure...|$|R

40|$|Cellular mechanisms, both {{destructive}} and protective, {{that are}} associated with cerebral ischemia are reviewed in this paper. Central to understanding the evolution of stroke are the concepts of ischemic core and surrounding <b>penumbral</b> <b>region</b> damage, delayed neuronal death, and neuronal rescue. The role of spreading depression in the evolution of subsequent ATP depletion, ion shifts, glutamate release, activation of glutamate receptors, intracellular Ca 2 + changes, and generation of reactive oxygen species in the penumbra in relationship to neuronal and glial cell damage are discussed. We conclude that the most fruitful areas for future stroke research include traditional approaches as well as novel approaches. Traditional approaches include stroke prevention and examination of the effects of combinations of proven and promising effective therapeutic interventions. Novel approaches include delineating mechanisms whereby growth factors and compounds such as deprenyl and staurosporine afford neuroprotection, ultimately leading to direct manipulation of the signal transduction pathways that lead to neuronal dysfunction and death. This includes determining which genes are activated and repressed in specific response to hypoxia-ischemia and determining how such alterations in gene expression affect survival and function of neurons. We also suggest that advantage be taken of the blood-brain barrier compromise during stroke in designing neuroprotective therapies.

40|$|Abstract. The {{calculation}} of particle trajectories in the Earth’s magnetic field {{has been a}} subject of interest {{since the time of}} Störmer. The fundamental problem is that the trajectory-tracing process involves using mathematical equations that have ‘no solution in closed form’. This difficulty has forced researchers to use the ‘brute force ’ technique of numerical integration of many individual trajectories to ascertain the behavior of trajectory families or groups. As the power of computers has improved over the decades, the numerical integration procedure has grown more tractable and while the problem is still formidable, thousands of trajectories can be computed without the expenditure of excessive resources. As particle trajectories are computed and the characteristics analyzed we can determine the cutoff rigidity of a specific location and viewing direction and direction and deduce the direction in space of various cosmic ray anisotropies. Unfortunately, cutoff rigidities are not simple parameters due to the chaotic behavior of the cosmic-ray trajectories in the cosmic ray <b>penumbral</b> <b>region.</b> As the computational problem becomes more manageable, there is still the issue of the accuracy of the magnetic field models. Over the decades, magnetic field models of increasing complexity have been developed and utilized.

Sunspots are amongst the most prominent features on the solar surface, but many of their aspects are surprisingly poorly understood. We analyzed a λ= 3 mm (100 GHz) mosaic image obtained by ALMA, which includes a large sunspot within the active region AR 12470 on December 16, 2015. The 3 mm map has a field-of-view and spatial resolution, which is the highest spatial-resolution map of an entire sunspot in this frequency range. We find a gradient of 3 mm brightness from a high value in the outer penumbra to a low value in the inner penumbra/outer umbra. Within the inner umbra, there is a marked increase in 3 mm brightness temperature, which we call an umbral brightness enhancement. This enhanced emission corresponds to a temperature excess of 800 K relative to the surrounding inner <b>penumbral</b> <b>region</b> and coincides with excess brightness in the 1330 and 1400 Å slitjaw images of the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), adjacent to a partial lightbridge.

We find instantaneous horizontal shear of penumbral fibrils, with initial velocities of about 1. 6 km/s, produced when a flare ribbon passes over them. This velocity decreases rapidly at first, then gradually decays, so that about one hour later, the fibrils return to a new equilibrium. During the one hour interval, the total displacement of these fibrils is around 2. 0 Mm, with an average shear velocity of 0. 55 km/s.

The spatial extent of VCAM- 1 expression is considerably greater than the detectable lesion using diffusion-weighted imaging (25 % versus 3 % total brain volume), which is generally taken to reflect the core of the lesion at early time points. Thus, VCAM- 1 imaging seems to reveal both core and <b>penumbral</b> <b>regions,</b> and our data implicate VCAM- 1 upregulation and associated inflammatory processes in the progression of penumbral tissue to infarction. Our findings indicate that such molecular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) approaches could be important clinical tools for patient evaluation, acute monitoring of therapy, and design of specific treatment strategies...|$|R
40|$|The non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor/channel {{antagonist}} dizocilipine maleate (MK- 801) {{has been}} reported to reduce infarct volume in a variety of focal stroke models. We examined the effect of MK- 801 on infarct volume and cerebral blood flow in temporary and permanent focal ischemia in rats. In Wistar rats exposed to permanent right common carotid artery and 2 h of transient right middle cerebral and left common carotid artery occlusion followed by 22 h of reperfusion, MK- 801 reduced infarct volume by 73 % (P less than 0. 05) and significantly increased cerebral blood flow to the ischemic core throughout the 2 -h period of ischemia. In spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) exposed to permanent right common carotid artery occlusion and 2 h of transient right middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by 22 h of reperfusion, MK- 801 decreased infarct volume by 13 % (P greater than 0. 05) and increased cerebral blood flow to the <b>penumbral</b> <b>region.</b> In SHRs subjected to permanent right common carotid and middle cerebral artery occlusion MK- 801 reduced infarct volume by 18 % at 3 h (P greater than 0. 05), by 25 % at 6 h (P less than 0. 01) and by 18 % at 24 h (P less than 0. 05). MK- 801 -treated SHRs had no difference in cerebral blood flow to the ischemic core, but increased cerebral blood flow to penumbral zones as compared with untreated SHRs. These results suggest that the protective effect of MK- 801, at least in part, relates to improved cerebral blood flow...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} spectropolarimetric {{measurements}} of a sunspot {{in the active}} region NOAA 6958 (15 S 03 W), situated near the central meridian disk passage. The follower polarity sunspot was somewhat symmetrically round shaped with an elongated penumbra. There were several opposite polarity magnetic elements at, and beyond the penumbral boundary. The H-alpha images of the sunspot show the bright emission regions near the penumbral boundary towards the sun-center, which was of opposite polarity {{with respect to the}} main spot. The net-circular polarization (NCP) map shows that NCP is negative in the inner part of the spot and positive at the penumbral boundary and near the H-alpha plage. The Doppler velocities were determined by measuring the center-of-gravity (COG) of the Stokes-I profile and zero-crossing (ZC) wavelength of the Stokes-V profiles. The COG velocity map in general agrees with the Evershed flow. In addition, it shows the up flow in the <b>penumbral</b> <b>region.</b> The ZC velocities show the strong down flow at the penumbral boundary. Double-lobed Stokes-V profiles are observed at the locations, where the penumbral fibrils terminate coinciding the H-alpha plage. The Double lobed profiles had an unshifted component similar to the Stokes-V profiles of the sunspot penumbra and a shifted component with a velocity of about 5 km/s. The amplitude of the second component increases along the penumbral fibril {{as a function of the}} distance from the center of the sunspot. In this paper we discuss the role of emerging flux in generating the observed double lobed profiles. Based on our present observations, we propose to observe with the Solar-B Spectropolarimeter for understanding the nature of emerging flux near the sunspots...|$|E
40|$|Cerebral {{microvascular}} disease predominantly affects brain {{white matter}} and deep grey matter, resulting in ischaemic damage {{that ranges from}} lacunar infarcts to white matter hyperintensities seen on magnetic resonance imaging. These lesions are common and result in both clinical stroke syndromes and accumulate over time, resulting in cognitive deficits and dementia. Magnetic resonance imaging studies suggest that these lesions progress over time, accumulate adjacent to prior lesions and have a <b>penumbral</b> <b>region</b> susceptible to further injury. The pathological correlates of this adjacent injury in surviving myelinated axons have not been previously defined. In this study, we sought to determine the molecular organization of axons in tissue adjacent to lacunar infarcts and in the regions surrounding microinfarcts, by determining critical elements in axonal function: the morphology and length of node of Ranvier segments and adjacent paranodal segments. We examined post-mortem brain tissue from six patients with lacunar infarcts and tissue from two patients with autosomal dominant retinal vasculopathy and cerebral leukoencephalopathy (previously known as hereditary endotheliopathy with retinopathy, nephropathy and stroke) who accumulate progressive white matter ischae-mic lesions {{in the form of}} lacunar and microinfarcts. In axons adjacent to lacunar infarcts yet extending up to 150 % of the infarct diameter away, both nodal and paranodal length increase by 20 % and 80 %, respectively, reflecting a loss of normal cell-cell adhesion and signalling between axons and oligodendrocytes. Using premorbid magnetic resonance images, brain regions from patients with retinal vasculopathy and cerebral leukoencephalopathy that harboured periventricular white matter hyperintensities were selected and the molecular organization of axons was determined within these regions. As in regions adjacent to lacuna...|$|E
40|$|Metastasis to {{the brain}} results in {{significant}} impairment of brain function and poor patient survival. Currently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is under-utilised in monitoring brain metastases and their effects on brain function. Here, we sought to establish a model of focal brain metastasis in the rat that enables serial multimodal structural and functional MRI studies, and to assess the sensitivity of these approaches to metastatic growth. Female Berlin-Druckrey-IX rats were injected intracerebrally with metastatic ENU 1564 cells in the ventroposterior medial nucleus (VPM) of the thalamus, a relay node of the whisker-to-barrel cortex pathway. Animals underwent multimodal structural and vascular MRI, as well as functional MRI of the cortical blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) responses to whisker pad stimulation. T 2, diffusion, magnetisation transfer and perfusion weighted MRI enabled differentiation between a central area of more advanced metastatic growth and <b>penumbral</b> <b>regions</b> of co-optive perivascular micrometastatic growth, with magnetisation transfer MRI being the most sensitive to micrometastatic growth. Areas of cortical BOLD activation in response to whisker pad stimulation were significantly reduced in the hemisphere containing metastases in the VPM. The reduction in BOLD response correlated with metastatic burden in the thalamus, and was sensitive {{to the presence of}} smaller metastases than currently detectable clinically. Our findings suggest that multimodal MRI provides greater sensitivity to tumour heterogeneity and micrometastatic growth than single modality contrast-enhanced MRI. Understanding the relationships between these MRI parameters and the underlying pathology may greatly enhance the utility of MRI in diagnosis, staging and monitoring of brain metastasis...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the on-board imager cone beam CT (OBI-CBCT) Hounsfield units (HUs) for treatment planning. Materials and Methods: The HU-electron density (eD) calibration for CBCT, the CATphan 504 phantom was used, and the CBCT HU (HU CBCT) consistency was studied {{by analyzing the}} CBCT images of Rando phantom and compared with planning CT. The latter study was also performed on CBCT images of 10 H&N patients. For comparison, the structures contoured and treatment plans generated on CT were transferred on to the CBCT after registration. The treatment plans were compared using gamma (g) index analysis and the plan comparison dose volume histograms (DVH PlanComp). Results: Although the HU-eD calibration curves of both the planning CT and CBCT {{were found to be}} linear, differences in mean HU values were found in the region of interest (ROI) corresponding to Acrylic, Derlin, and Teflon, viz., 144 ± 11 HU, 193 ± 5 HU, and 257 ± 7 HU respectively. For all the cases, the consistency and reproducibility of HU CBCT values for low density medium agreed the HU CT except at regions of high density. Overall g-evaluation showed more than 94 % pixels pass rate and DVH results showed small difference in the DVH PlanComp, Rando, and large differences in DVH PlanComp, patient for structures contoured at peripheral regions (PV) of CBCT images. Conclusions: We conclude that the pixel-to-pixel HU corrections for entire range of eD are not necessary for OBI-CBCT images. Application of local correction in the high-density and <b>penumbral</b> <b>regions</b> would facilitate the use of CBCT images for routine treatment planning...|$|R
40|$|Objective: We {{describe}} the first clinical application of transient hyperoxia (“oxygen challenge”) during T 2 *-weighted {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI), to detect differences in vascular deoxyhemoglobin between tissue compartments following stroke. Methods: Subjects with acute ischemic stroke were scanned with T 2 *-weighted MRI and oxygen challenge. For regions defined as infarct core (diffusion-weighted imaging lesion) and presumed penumbra (perfusion-diffusion mismatch [threshold = T max &# 8805; 4 seconds], or regions exhibiting diffusion lesion expansion at day 3), T 2 *-weighted signal intensity–time curves corresponding to the duration of oxygen challenge were generated. From these, the area under the curve, gradient of incline of the signal increase, time to maximum signal, and percentage signal change after oxygen challenge were measured. Results: We identified 25 subjects with stroke lesions > 1 ml. Eighteen subjects with good quality T 2 *-weighted signal intensity–time curves in the contralateral hemisphere were analyzed. Curves from the diffusion lesion had a smaller area under the curve, percentage signal change, and gradient of incline, and longer time to maximum signal (p < 0. 05, n = 17) compared to normal tissue, which consistently showed signal increase during oxygen challenge. Curves in the presumed <b>penumbral</b> <b>regions</b> (n = 8) showed varied morphology, but at hyperacute time points (< 8 hours) showed a tendency to greater percentage signal change. Interpretation: Differences in T 2 *-weighted signal intensity–time curves during oxygen challenge in brain regions with different pathophysiological states after stroke are likely to reflect differences in deoxyhemoglobin concentration, and therefore differences in metabolic activity. Despite its underlying complexities, this technique offers a possible novel mode of metabolic imaging in acute stroke. </p...|$|R
