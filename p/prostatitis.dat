5|$|Chronic <b>prostatitis</b> in {{the forms}} of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain {{syndrome}} and chronic bacterial <b>prostatitis</b> (not acute bacterial <b>prostatitis</b> or asymptomatic inflammatory <b>prostatitis)</b> may cause recurrent urinary tract infections in males. Risk of infections increases as males age. While bacteria is commonly present in the urine of older males this {{does not appear to}} affect the risk of urinary tract infections.|$|E
5|$|In {{women with}} {{cervicitis}} (inflammation of the cervix) or vaginitis (inflammation of the vagina) and in {{young men with}} UTI symptoms, a Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrheae infection may be the cause. These infections are typically classified as a urethritis rather than a urinary tract infection. Vaginitis may also {{be due to a}} yeast infection. Interstitial cystitis (chronic pain in the bladder) may be considered for people who experience multiple episodes of UTI symptoms but urine cultures remain negative and not improved with antibiotics. <b>Prostatitis</b> (inflammation of the prostate) may also be considered in the differential diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Prostatitis</b> is {{inflammation}} of the prostate gland. There are primarily four different forms of <b>prostatitis,</b> each with different causes and outcomes. Two relatively uncommon forms, acute <b>prostatitis</b> and chronic bacterial <b>prostatitis,</b> are treated with antibiotics (category I and II, respectively). Chronic non-bacterial <b>prostatitis</b> or male chronic pelvic pain syndrome (category III), which comprises about 95% of <b>prostatitis</b> diagnoses, is treated by a large variety of modalities including alpha blockers, physical therapy, psychotherapy, antihistamines, anxiolytics, nerve modulators, phytotherapy, , surgery, and more. More recently, a combination of trigger point and psychological therapy has proved effective for category III <b>prostatitis</b> as well. Category IV <b>prostatitis,</b> relatively uncommon in the general population, {{is a type of}} leukocytosis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Prostatitis</b> due to Escherichia coli.|$|E
25|$|Prostate disease* in dogs {{includes}} {{benign prostatic hyperplasia}} (BPH), <b>prostatitis</b> (infection of the prostate), cancer, and cysts and abscesses. BPH is {{the most}} common and is found in older intact (not neutered) dogs. Signs include blood in the urine and straining to urinate and defecate. Castration is the treatment of choice. Prostatis can be associated with BPH. Bacteria causing <b>prostatitis</b> include E. coli, Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., and Mycoplasma spp.|$|E
25|$|Nitrofurantoin is not {{recommended}} {{for the treatment of}} pyelonephritis, <b>prostatitis</b> and intra-abdominal abscess, because of extremely poor tissue penetration and low blood levels.|$|E
25|$|T. vaginalis {{infection}} in males {{has been found}} to cause asymptomatic urethritis and <b>prostatitis.</b> In the prostate, it may create chronic inflammation that may eventually lead to prostate cancer.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the general indications for {{all members of the}} tetracycline antibiotics group, doxycycline is frequently used to treat Lyme disease, chronic <b>prostatitis,</b> sinusitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, acne, rosacea, and rickettsial infections.|$|E
25|$|As of 2010 it was {{recommended}} by the IDSA as a first-line treatment option for catheter-associated urinary tract infections in adults. In combination with metronidazole it is recommended as one of several first-line treatment options for adult patients with community-acquired intra-abdominal infections of mild-to-moderate severity. The IDSA also recommends it in combination with rifampicin as a first-line treatment for prosthetic joint infections. The American Urological Association recommends levofloxacin as a first-line treatment to prevent bacterial <b>prostatitis</b> when the prostate is biopsied. and as of 2004 it {{was recommended}} to treat bacterial <b>prostatitis</b> by the NIH research network studying the condition.|$|E
25|$|Levofloxacin is used {{to treat}} infections including: {{respiratory}} tract infections, cellulitis, urinary tract infections, <b>prostatitis,</b> anthrax, endocarditis, meningitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, traveler's diarrhea, tuberculosis, and plague and is available by mouth, intravenously, and in eye drop form.|$|E
25|$|The {{classical}} {{presentation of}} the syndrome starts with urinary symptoms such as burning pain on urination (dysuria) or an increased frequency of urination. Other urogenital problems may arise such as <b>prostatitis</b> in men and cervicitis, salpingitis and/or vulvovaginitis in women.|$|E
25|$|PSA {{levels can}} be also {{increased}} by <b>prostatitis,</b> irritation, {{benign prostatic hyperplasia}} (BPH), and recent ejaculation, producing a false positive result. Digital rectal examination (DRE) {{has been shown in}} several studies to produce an increase in PSA. However, the effect is clinically insignificant, since DRE causes the most substantial increases in patients with PSA levels already elevated over 4.0nbsp&ng/mL.|$|E
25|$|Levofloxacin, {{sold under}} the trade names Levaquin among others, is an antibiotic. It {{is used to}} treat a number of {{bacterial}} infections including acute bacterial sinusitis, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, chronic <b>prostatitis,</b> and some types of gastroenteritis. Along with other antibiotics it {{may be used to}} treat tuberculosis, meningitis, or pelvic inflammatory disease. It is available by mouth, intravenously, and in eye drop form.|$|E
25|$|Fluoroquinolones {{are often}} used for {{genitourinary}} infections and are widely used {{in the treatment of}} hospital-acquired infections associated with urinary catheters. In community-acquired infections, they are recommended only when risk factors for multidrug resistance are present or after other antibiotic regimens have failed. However, for serious acute cases of pyelonephritis or bacterial <b>prostatitis</b> where the patient may need to be hospitalised, fluoroquinolones are recommended as first-line therapy.|$|E
25|$|Infection or {{inflammation}} of the prostate (<b>prostatitis)</b> may increase the chance for prostate cancer while another study shows infection may help prevent prostate cancer by increasing blood to the area. In particular, infection with the sexually transmitted infections chlamydia, gonorrhea, or syphilis seems to increase risk. Finally, obesity and elevated blood levels of testosterone may increase the risk for prostate cancer. There is an association between vasectomy and prostate cancer; however, {{more research is needed}} to determine if this is a causative relationship.|$|E
25|$|Ofloxacin is an {{antibiotic}} {{useful for the}} treatment of a number of bacterial infections. When taken by mouth or injection into a vein this includes pneumonia, cellulitis, urinary tract infections, <b>prostatitis,</b> plague and certain types of infectious diarrhea. Other uses, along with other medications, include multidrug resistant tuberculosis. An eye drop may be used for a superficial bacterial infection of the eye and an ear drop may be used for otitis media when there is a hole in the ear drum.|$|E
25|$|P. aeruginosa {{represents}} a commonly used biofilm model organism {{since it is}} involved in different types of biofilm-associated infections. Examples of such infections include chronic wounds, chronic otitis media, chronic <b>prostatitis</b> and chronic lung infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. About 80% of CF patients have chronic lung infection, caused mainly by P. aeruginosa growing in a non-surface attached biofilms surround by PMN. The infection remains present despite aggressive antibiotic therapy and is a common {{cause of death in}} CF patients due to constant inflammatory damage to the lungs.|$|E
25|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis for LUTS is broad and includes various medical conditions, neurologic disorders, {{and other diseases}} of the bladder, urethra, and prostate such as bladder cancer, urinary tract infection, urethral stricture, urethral calculi (stones), chronic <b>prostatitis,</b> and prostate cancer. Neurogenic bladder can cause urinary retention and cause symptoms {{similar to those of}} BPH. This may occur as a result of uncoordinated contraction of the bladder muscle or impairment in the timing of bladder muscle contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation. Notable causes of neurogenic bladder include disorders of the central nervous system such as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and spinal cord injuries as well as disorders of the peripheral nervous system such as diabetes mellitus, vitamin B12 deficiency, and alcohol-induced nerve damage. Individuals affected by heart failure often experience nighttime awakenings to urinate due to redistribution of fluid accumulated in swollen legs.|$|E

2500|$|Prostate infections or inflammations (<b>prostatitis),</b> bladder infections or inflammations (cystitis), or kidney (renal) infections (nephritis) or inflammations {{which have}} spread to and caused {{swelling}} in the vessels of the testicles or scrotum ...|$|E
2500|$|Brucellosis in dogs {{is caused}} by Brucella canis. [...] It is a sexually {{transmitted}} disease, but can also be spread through contact with aborted fetuses. [...] The most common sign is abortion during the last trimester or stillbirth. [...] Other symptoms include inflammation of the intervertebral disc and eye (uveitis), and inflammation of the testicle (orchitis) and prostate (<b>prostatitis)</b> in males.|$|E
2500|$|Extracts of {{the bark}} have been {{reported}} to reduce contractions of smooth muscle of isolated rat prostate glands. [...] Certain polysaccharide fractions from Phellodendron chinense were reported to increase T cell activity and reduce cell replication of tumors in mice. [...] A group studying Nexrutine, a brand of fractionated extract, found that it reduced the rate of replication of prostate tumor cells. Tests of Nexrutine (300–600mg/kg) in a mouse strain designed to develop prostate cancer found a dramatic reduction in palpable tumors. Another brand, Prostant, has been used for chronic <b>prostatitis</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{was first}} {{approved}} for marketing in Japan in 1985 for oral administration, and Daiichi marketed it there under {{the brand name}} Tarvid. [...] Daiichi, working with Johnson & Johnson, obtained FDA approval in December 1990 under the brand name Floxin, labelled for use in adults with lower respiratory tract infections, skin and skin structure infections, urinary tract infections, <b>prostatitis,</b> and sexually transmitted diseases. [...] By 1991 it was also marketed as Tarvid by Hoechst in the UK, Germany, Belgium and Portugal; as Oflocet in France, Portugal, Tunisia and several African countries by Roussel-Uclafas, as [...] Oflocin by Glaxo in Italy and as Flobacin by Sigma-Tau in Italy.|$|E
2500|$|PSA {{is present}} in small {{quantities}} in the serum of men with healthy prostates, but is often elevated {{in the presence of}} prostate cancer or other prostate disorders. [...] The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF, 2012) does not recommend PSA screening for prostate cancer, noting that the test may result in [...] "overdiagnosis" [...] and [...] "overtreatment" [...] because [...] "most prostate cancer is asymptomatic for life" [...] and treatments involve risks of complications including impotence (erectile dysfunction) and incontinence. The USPSTF concludes [...] "the potential benefit does not outweigh the expected harms". PSA is not a unique indicator of prostate cancer, but may also detect <b>prostatitis</b> or benign prostatic hyperplasia.|$|E
2500|$|Goldberger experimented on 11 prisoners (one was {{dismissed}} because of <b>prostatitis).</b> Before the experiment, {{the prisoners were}} eating the prison fare fed to all inmates at Rankin Prison Farm in Mississippi. Goldberger started feeding them a restricted diet of grits, syrup, mush, biscuits, cabbage, sweet potatoes, rice, collards, and coffee with sugar (no milk). Healthy white male volunteers were selected as the typical skin lesions were easier to see in Caucasians and this population was felt to be those least susceptible to the disease, and thus provide the strongest evidence that the disease {{was caused by a}} nutritional deficiency. Subjects experienced mild, but typical cognitive and gastrointestinal symptoms, and within five months of this cereal-based diet, six of the 11 subjects broke out in the skin lesions that are necessary for a definitive diagnosis of pellagra. The lesions appeared first on the scrotum. [...] Goldberger was not given the opportunity to experimentally reverse the effects of diet-induced pellagra as the prisoners were released shortly after the diagnoses of pellagra were confirmed. In the 1920s he connected pellagra to the diet of rural areas with corn-based diets rather than infection, contrary to the common medical ideas of that time. Despite all his efforts, few physicians took up his ideas due to necessity of social reform, especially in the land system of that time, which led to many avoidable deaths and stereotypes. Goldberger is remembered as the [...] "unsung hero of American clinical epidemiology". However, he failed to identify a specific element whose absence caused pellagra.|$|E

50|$|<b>Prostatitis</b> (less {{commonly}} prostatosis) is {{inflammation of}} the prostate gland. <b>Prostatitis</b> is classified into acute, chronic, asymptomatic inflammatory <b>prostatitis,</b> and chronic pelvic pain syndrome.|$|E
50|$|Chronic {{bacterial}} <b>prostatitis</b> is {{a bacterial}} {{infection of the}} prostate gland. It should be distinguished from other forms of <b>prostatitis</b> such as acute bacterial <b>prostatitis</b> and chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS).|$|E
50|$|Acute <b>prostatitis</b> is {{a serious}} {{bacterial}} infection of the prostate gland. This infection is a medical emergency. It should be distinguished from other forms of <b>prostatitis</b> such as chronic bacterial <b>prostatitis</b> and chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS).|$|E
50|$|Chronic <b>prostatitis</b> in {{the forms}} of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain {{syndrome}} and chronic bacterial <b>prostatitis</b> (not acute bacterial <b>prostatitis</b> or asymptomatic inflammatory <b>prostatitis)</b> may cause recurrent urinary tract infections in males. Risk of infections increases as males age. While bacteria is commonly present in the urine of older males this {{does not appear to}} affect the risk of urinary tract infections.|$|E
5000|$|Asymptomatic {{inflammatory}} <b>prostatitis</b> is a painless {{inflammation of}} the prostate gland {{where there is no}} evidence of infection. [...] It should be distinguished from the other categories of <b>prostatitis</b> characterised by either pelvic pain or evidence of infection, such as chronic bacterial <b>prostatitis,</b> acute bacterial <b>prostatitis</b> and chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS). It is a common finding in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia.|$|E
5000|$|Chronic nonbacterial <b>prostatitis</b> {{or chronic}} prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain {{syndrome}} (CP/CPPS) is a pelvic pain condition in men, {{and should be}} distinguished from other forms of <b>prostatitis</b> such as chronic bacterial <b>prostatitis</b> and acute bacterial <b>prostatitis.</b> This condition was formerly known as prostatodynia (painful prostate). CP/CPPS and interstitial cystitis are sometimes referred to jointly as [...] "UCPPS" [...] (urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome).|$|E
50|$|Acute <b>prostatitis</b> is {{associated}} with a transiently elevated PSA, i.e., the PSA is increased during an episode of acute <b>prostatitis</b> and then decreases again after it has resolved. PSA testing is not indicated in the context of uncomplicated acute <b>prostatitis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Enterococcus {{may also}} cause <b>prostatitis.</b> <b>Prostatitis</b> is the {{swelling}} and {{inflammation of the}} prostate gland that is located below men’s bladders. <b>Prostatitis</b> can cause painful or difficult urination.
