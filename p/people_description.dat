When Rendra was being isolated, Rendra was in jail on May 1, 1978, because his poem has been regarded as protest and it against the government. Beside, Rendra can read realities around him and his personal experience when he went abroad. Because of his background, his creation of the poems by aliensasi theme or self isolation occurs. Isolation theme on the poem is not widely known by literary devotees; by this, the researcher interested in conducting study in alienasi theme of the poems. The problems on this study are (1) theme description of alineasi theme of poems by W. S. Rendra and (2) the use of diction on the poems by W. S. Rendra. The {{purposes of this study}} are to explain and to describe the theme description on poems by W. S. Rendra and identified the use of diction on the poems by W. S. Rendra. The significances are theoretically, expected to be useful to the reader generally and Indonesian Language and Literary Students specifically in increasing knowledge about alienasi theme in pomes. Practically, this study can be the guideline and references for further researcher, especially in correlation with alienasi theme in poems. Method of this study uses descriptive qualitative method. The data {{is in the form of}} row and paragraph. While the data sources are 1). Four anthologies consist of 18 poems; 2). “Blues untuk Bonnie” consists of three poems 3). “Potret Pembangunan” has four poems; and 4). “Disebabkan oleh Angin” consists of two poems. Therefore, in data collection, the researcher does documentation. Research procedure, the researcher has observation on the way of the poems read and it is analyzed repeatedly, note the idea in each poem and translate the meaning of the alienasi in the poems. Based on the result of study in alienasi theme on the poems by WS Rendra, there are four factors that are being the background of alienasi, loneliness, less of solidarity, hopeless and antipathy or unbelief. Then, the diction that is used here is diction of connotative words and the words shows the characteristic of Rendra as the poet by Javanese background that is explored through the esthetic words arrangement, so that emerge the high suggestion energy, like the feeling of love, happiness and anxiety...|$|E

The work definition of religion used in this research was: religion as a cognitive, emotional, valuative-attitudinal, interpersonal-relational and macrosociocultural characteristic of an individual, primary group, subculture or society (textural meaning) that is effective in avoiding or combating a wide variety of stressors and thus preventing tension from being transformed into stress (structural meaning). Eight orthodox Christians regardless age, gender, marital status or educational background, were selected from different laities. The criteria such as age, gender, professional status or church belonging were not used in this research due to the ethical issues. In-depth face-to-face interviews were conducted. Ethical clearance for the study was granted by the Tbilisi State Medical University Biomedical Research Ethics Committee and Norwegian Social Sciences Data Services.

We present evidence from four new time-use data sets for the United States and France on whether workers who are more gregarious, as revealed by their behavior when they are not working, tend to be employed in jobs that involve more social interactions. In each data set we find a significant and sizable relationship between the tendency to interact with others off the job and while working. <b>People’s</b> <b>descriptions</b> of their jobs and their personalities also accord reasonably well with their time use on and off the job. Furthermore, workers in occupations that require social interactions according to the O’Net Dictionary of Occupational Titles tend to spend more of their non-working time with friends.

40|$|This chapter {{reports on}} {{research}} {{carried out with}} boys and girls, aged 12 to 15, participating in Young Lives in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. It focuses on young <b>people’s</b> <b>descriptions,</b> explanations, and experiences of poverty and inequality in two contrasting rural communities and highlights implications for research, policy and practice, and rights. Young people growing up in poor communities are generally alert to inequalities and injustices, and to their own disadvantaged situations (see for example, Chapter 11 by Gillian Mann; Bissell 2009; Camfield 2010; or Witter 2002). The research presented here indicates that children perceive material inequalities as indicative of wider differences in power and position, {{of which they are}} very much a part. Children’s concerns, explanations, and experiences of the effects of poverty may differ from those of adults, and children often have distinct roles and responsibilities within their families for managing hardship and risk related to household poverty (for example, caring for siblings, carrying out essential household chores, working for pay, and going to school). There may also be important differences in patterns of children’s awareness and under-standing of inequality, reflecting their varied positioning in the social hierarchy and the range of social expectations they manage (related, for example, to age, gender, class, and ethnicity, or caste) ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the causes and {{consequences}} of job stress in Malaysia and make a comparison between Western and Eastern perspectives. Design/methodology/approach – A grounded theory approach was used to develop a lay representation of Malay <b>people's</b> <b>descriptions</b> of their experiences at work, including job stress. Interviews were conducted with 48 employees in Malaysia, using six semi-structured interview questions adopted from Kinman and Jones and translated into the Malay language, as a guide. Findings – Although most respondents perceived that individual factors play an important role in work stress, organizational factors seemed to be the dominant factor identified that contributes to work stress. Respondents also perceived the individual as key to stress reduction rather than management interventions. A new concept emerged in this study that was related to external factors impinging on work (such as globalization). Practical implications – Organizations should formulate strategies to prevent job stress among employees. They must also be alert to the impact of external factors that are now common in the Malay workplace. Originality/value – Research of job stress in employees in Eastern cultures is rare. The paper provides in-depth preliminary research which will lead to further investigations of job stress in Eastern workplace settings. Mohd Awang Idris, Maureen F. Dollard and Anthony H.
