25|$|Physical {{dependence}} is {{the physiological}} {{adaptation of the}} body to the presence of a substance, in this case opioid medication. It is defined by the development of withdrawal symptoms when the substance is discontinued, when the dose is reduced abruptly or, specifically in the case of opioids, when an antagonist (e.g., naloxone) or an agonist-antagonist (e.g., <b>pentazocine)</b> is administered. Physical dependence is a normal and expected aspect of certain medications and does not necessarily imply that the patient is addicted.|$|E

2500|$|Schmidt et al. (1985) reviews nalbuphine’s pre-clinical {{pharmacology}} and report comparative data {{relative to other}} types of opioid compounds. [...] The authors {{point out that the}} nalbuphine moiety is approximately ten times more pharmacologically potent than the mixed opioid agonist-antagonist butorphanol on an “antagonist index” scale which quantitates the drug’s ability to act both as an analgesic (via opioid κ-receptor agonism) as well as an μ-receptor antagonist. [...] The opioid antagonist activity of Nalbuphine is one-fourth as potent as nalorphine and 10 times that of <b>pentazocine.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Not {{only are}} tissues from maggots {{used to detect}} toxins, shed casings and insect feces have also been used to detect and {{identify}} toxins present in corpses upon death. [...] An instance of {{this finding was demonstrated}} by Edward McDonough, a medical examiner in Connecticut. [...] A mummified corpse of a middle-aged woman was found inside of her home. [...] Prescription medicine bottles were found with labels identifying the following drugs: ampicillin, Ceclor, doxycyline, erythromycin, Elavil, Lomotil, <b>pentazocine,</b> and Tylenol 3. [...] McDonough performed toxicological analyses on stomach contents and dried sections of brain and found lethal levels of amitriptyline and nortriptyline. [...] Insect feces, shed pupal cases of Megaselia scalaris (Diptera: Phoridae), and shed larval skins of Dermestes maculates (Coleoptera: Dermestidae) were gathered from the corpse at the scene. [...] McDonough sent these to an FBI lab which broke down the complex structures of the samples using strong acids and bases and freed the toxins for analysis. [...] The cast pupal cases and larval skins were also found to contain amitriptyline and nortriptyline. [...] Larger concentrations were discovered in the pupal cases because phorid flies prefer to feed on softer tissues. [...] The hide beetle larval skins revealed lower concentrations of the drugs because these beetles prefer to feed on dry, mummified bodies. [...] The use of pupal cases and larval skins allows for investigators to detect toxins in a body years after death.|$|E

5000|$|In the 1970s, {{recreational}} drug users discovered that combining <b>pentazocine</b> with tripelennamine (a first-generation ethylenediamine antihistamine most commonly dispensed under the brand names Pelamine and Pyribenzamine) produced a euphoric sensation. Since tripelennamine tablets are typically blue {{in color and}} brand-name <b>Pentazocine</b> is known as Talwin (hence [...] "Ts"), the pentazocine/tripelennamine combination acquired the slang name Ts and blues.After health-care professionals and drug-enforcement officials became aware of this scenario, the mu-opioid-antagonist naloxone was added to oral preparations containing <b>pentazocine</b> to prevent perceived [...] "misuse" [...] via injection, and the reported incidence of its recreational use has declined precipitously since.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pentazocine</b> was {{originally}} classified in Schedule V under the Controlled Substances Act but a petition was {{filed with the}} D.E.A. on October 1, 1971, to shift it to Schedule III. The petition was filed by Joseph L. Fink III, a pharmacist and law student at Georgetown University Law Center {{as part of the}} course Lawyering in the Public Interest. That petition was accepted for review on November 10, 1971 D.E.A. published a Final Rule transferring it to schedule IV on January 10, 1979, with an effective date of February 9, 1979 This is understood to be the first instance of a successful petition to reclassify a substance under the relatively recently enacted Controlled Substances Act. <b>Pentazocine</b> is still classified in Schedule IV under the Controlled Substances Act in the United States, even with the addition of Naloxone. although some states classify it in Schedule III. Internationally, <b>pentazocine</b> is a Schedule III drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. [...] <b>Pentazocine</b> has a DEA ACSCN of 9720; being a Schedule IV substance, the DEA does not assign an annual manufacturing quota for <b>pentazocine</b> for the United States.|$|E

50|$|Phenazocine {{appears to}} be a much {{stronger}} analgesic with fewer side effects than <b>pentazocine,</b> probably due to a more favorable μ/κ binding ratio. Phenazocine is a much more potent analgesic than <b>pentazocine</b> and other drugs in the benzomorphan series, most probably due to the presence of an N-phenethyl substitution, which is known to boost μ-opioid activity in many classes of opioid analgesics.|$|E

It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in June 1967 after being favorably reviewed following testing on 12,000 patients in the United States. The analgesic compound was first made at Sterling in 1958. U.S. testing was conducted between 1961 and 1967.

50|$|Dezocine is {{generally}} administered intravenously. It {{can also be}} administered in intramuscular doses, and is given singularly rather than continuously. Dezocine {{has been found to}} be an effective painkiller comparable to meperidine (pethidine), and so is a more effective analgesic than <b>pentazocine,</b> but causes relatively more respiratory depression than <b>pentazocine.</b> It is a useful drug for the treatment of pain, but side effects such as dizziness limit its clinical application, and it can produce opioid withdrawal syndrome in patients already dependent on other opioids.|$|E
5000|$|Phenazocine {{was invented}} in the 1950s. [...] It {{was one of a}} number of benzomorphan opioids (including <b>pentazocine,</b> dezocine, and cyclazocine) {{developed}} in the search for non-addictive strong analgesics.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pentazocine</b> is a synthetically-prepared prototypical mixed agonist-antagonist {{narcotic}} (opioid analgesic) drug of the benzomorphan {{class of}} opioids {{used to treat}} moderate to moderately severe pain. <b>Pentazocine</b> is sold under several brand names, such as Fortral, Sosegon, Talwin NX (with the μ-antagonist naloxone, will cause withdrawal in opioid dependent persons on injection), Talwin, Talwin PX (without naloxone), Fortwin (Lactate injectable form) and Talacen (with acetaminophen). This compound may exist as one of two enantiomers, named (+)-pentazocine and (−)-pentazocine. (−)-pentazocine is a κ-opioid receptor agonist, while (+)-pentazocine is not, instead displaying a ten-fold greater affinity for the σ receptor. Usually, in its oral formulations, it is combined with naloxone so as to prevent people from crushing the tablets, dissolving them in a solvent (like water) and injecting them for a high (as naloxone is not orally bioavailable it produces no effect when the formulation is used orally, but it blocks the opioid effects of <b>pentazocine</b> if injected intravenously for a high). Related drugs include phenazocine, dezocine, cyclazocine and several chemicals used in research on the central nervous system.|$|E

50|$|Cyclazocine {{is a mixed}} opioid agonist/antagonist {{related to}} dezocine, <b>pentazocine</b> and phenazocine. This family of opioid drugs is called the benzomorphans or benzazocines. It is a KOR agonist and MOR partial agonist, and also has high {{affinity}} for the DOR.|$|E
5000|$|Some drugs of the opioid class have psychotomimetic effects. Particularly, mixed kappa {{receptor}} agonist mu receptor antagonist opioid analgesics can cause dose-related psychotomimesis.
