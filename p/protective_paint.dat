It was founded in 1921 by Robert Fergusson (a sea captain, not the famous poet) after he noticed that raw fish oil spilled on rusty metal decks stopped corrosion from spreading. He soon incorporated whale oil into the formula, although many changes have been made over the years. Rust-Oleum products no longer contain whale oil, instead using resins derived from Alkyds, polyurethanes, epoxys, latex, etc.|$|R
30|$|Before their uses as architectural, {{domestic}} and automotive paints, the main applications of PU coatings were clear wood varnishes, leather finishes, maintenance and <b>protective</b> <b>paints.</b> Starting from 1952, {{most of the}} early PU coatings were made of polyester-polyisocyanate polymers. In the 1960 s, the gradual decrease of costs for diisocyanates and other chemical precursors contributed to the market expansion of the PU coatings [14]. At this time, in the US, urethane oils, obtained by reacting diisocyanates with drying oils or their derivatives, were the most widespread type of PU coatings.|$|R

40|$|Five {{corrosion}} protective painls, {{including three}} used as on-rust ones, were tested for their anticorrosive effects at the outdoor exposure test yard of University of the Ryukyus, beginning on September 1, 1988. First, clean JIS SS 41 mild steel plates of 15 x 15 cm x 3. 2 mm each were exposed outdoor for 3 months,then they were removed {{of the resulting}} rust {{by means of a}} wire brush to retain slight rust. These specimens together with new plate specimens which were cleaned by grit blasting to retain no rust, were coated with the same <b>protective</b> <b>paints.</b> In addition, three kinds of uncoated steel sheets (JIS SS 41 mild steel, JIS SPCD cold rolled carbon steel and JIS SPA - H weathering steel), and two kinds of zinc coated steel plates (JIS SGCC hot dip zinc coated steel and zinc hot dip galvanized mild steel) were used as the specimens to obtain the atmospheric corrosion data. The results obtained by this outdoor exposure test are as follows. 1) After 6 month exposure, the three kinds of uncoated steel sheets showed equal corrosion rates of about 10 mg/dm^ 2 /day. Their corroded conditions were also equal to each other. The two kinds of zinc coated steel plates were increased in weight slightly due to oxidation of zinc. 2) Both the specimens coated with <b>protective</b> <b>paints</b> on their surfaces with slight rust and with no rust, respectively, showed no fault and no difference in their appearance. All paints coated on the surfaces with no rust showed good adhesive strength, and onc on-rust paints showed poor adhesive strength. 3) The results of cross cut test were nearly the same as those of pull off test, except when the overcoatability between the undercoat and the top coat was poor. 4) The impact strength of the coated paints in the initial stage was poorer than that after exposure. The longer the exposure period, the more improved this strength...|$|R

30|$|A {{number of}} {{aviation}} engineers have {{been credited with}} the breakthrough of air propulsion from turbo-prop to jet—a revolutionary design. But, Kelly Johnson, the American aeronautics engineer, contributed more greatly {{than any of his}} predecessors because his “Blackbird” supersonic spy plane was a unique outcome of the need for speed, height, and safety. This would become the forerunner of passenger air travel in our age, which is almost exclusively by jet propulsion. Kelly Johnson invented the “skunk work” practice in which technical innovations are constructed in specially equipped laboratories and workplaces with their own budget. He worked during the Cold War between the USA and the then Soviet Union and was commissioned to build a plane that could fly on Mach 3 at an altitude of 80, 000  ft in order to avoid Soviet radar systems. Saeed and Sebastien (2014) noted that flying at such an unprecedented speed and height necessitated the development of new designs in aerodynamics, special fuels that would not freeze or coagulate in severe sub-zero temperatures, new structural materials, and manufacturing tools and techniques, as well as unfamiliar hydraulic fluids, fuel tank sealants, <b>protective</b> <b>paints</b> that had the necessary elasticity when stretched by extraordinary speeds, hard and soft plastics, and new conducting materials in wiring technology.|$|R
