5|$|In 2003, Chia mooted {{the idea}} that Singaporeans {{should be able to}} borrow from their own Central <b>Provident</b> <b>Fund</b> (CPF) savings to tide over periods of {{financial}} difficulty. His rationale was that if individuals could borrow from their own CPF accounts to buy depreciating property and money-losing stocks, there was no reason why they {{should not be allowed to}} do so to pay for bills. Dr. Ong Seh Hong, MP for Aljunied GRC, opposed the view, stating that it was important and for the good of Singapore that Singaporeans were independent individuals who could assume the risks and successes of their investments and be self-sufficient.|$|E
5|$|The Committee to Review Ministerial Salaries {{recommended}} that pensions for political appointment holders be abolished {{in favour of}} Central <b>Provident</b> <b>Fund</b> payments. Appointment holders appointed on and after 21 May 2011 will not receive any pension, while those appointed before that date will only be eligible for pensions accrued up to that date. Such pensions will be paid after they step down or retire from office. If the removal of pensions is taken into account, the Prime Minister's annual salary will be reduced from the 2010 figure by 36%, and that of MR4-grade ministers by 37%.|$|E
30|$|What {{should be}} {{included}} in minimum wage paid to workers may also be different in different provinces. For example, minimum wages in Beijing, Shanghai, and Jiangxi provinces do not include the employee payments to social security or housing <b>provident</b> <b>funds.</b> In China, social security payments and housing <b>provident</b> <b>funds</b> are co-paid by employee and employer. The employer portion of social security payments and housing <b>provident</b> <b>funds</b> are excluded from the wage calculation in all provinces. Minimum wages in Jiangsu province include social security payments by the employee but not housing <b>provident</b> <b>funds.</b>|$|R
50|$|Accordingly, {{close of}} the year 1951 {{witnessed}} the promulgation of the Employees' <b>Provident</b> <b>Funds</b> Ordinance. The Ordinance promulgated on 15 November 1951 {{was replaced by the}} Employees' <b>Provident</b> <b>Funds</b> Act, 1952 which extended to the whole of India except Jammu and Kashmir. The Employees' <b>Provident</b> <b>Funds</b> Scheme, 1952 framed under section 5 of the Act was brought into force by stages and was enforced in its entirety by 1 November 1952.|$|R
30|$|To {{assure that}} we are {{comparing}} minimum wage standards on a comparable basis, the minimum-to-average wage ratios in Table  2 have accounted {{for the fact that}} some provinces include social security payments and housing <b>provident</b> <b>funds</b> as part of the wage when calculating minimum wages. For example, the minimum wages in Beijing, Shanghai and Jiangxi do not include social security payments and housing <b>provident</b> <b>funds,</b> and the minimum wages in Jiangsu began to include only social security payments (but not housing <b>provident</b> <b>funds)</b> on November 1 st, 2005.|$|R
5|$|The lack of {{good public}} housing, poor sanitation, and high {{unemployment}} led to social problems from crime to health issues. The proliferation of squatter settlements resulted in safety hazards and caused the Bukit Ho Swee Fire in 1961 that killed four people and left 16,000 others homeless. The Housing Development Board set up before independence {{continued to be}} largely successful and huge building projects sprung up to provide affordable public housing to resettle the squatters. Within a decade, {{the majority of the}} population had been housed in these apartments. The Central <b>Provident</b> <b>Fund</b> (CPF) Housing Scheme, introduced in 1968, allows residents to use their compulsory savings account to purchase HDB flats and gradually increases home ownership in Singapore.|$|E
5|$|A {{statutory}} {{board is}} an autonomous {{agency of the}} Government that is established by an Act of Parliament and overseen by a government ministry. The Act sets out the purposes, powers and rights of the agency. Unlike ministries and government departments that are subdivisions of ministries, statutory boards may not be staffed by civil servants and have greater independence and flexibility in their operations. They are managed by boards of directors whose members usually include businessmen, professionals, senior civil servants and officials of trade unions. The Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), the Central <b>Provident</b> <b>Fund</b> Board (CPF), the Housing and Development Board (HDB), the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS), the Land Transport Authority (LTA), the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), the National Heritage Board (NHB), and the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) are all statutory boards.|$|E
5|$|Thumboo {{graduated}} with a Bachelor of Arts with honours (B.A. (Hons.)) in English in 1956. Hoping to teach and pursue a further degree, he applied for a position at the university but was rejected as few locals held academic posts at that time. He therefore entered the civil service, working for the Income Tax Department (1957–1961), Central <b>Provident</b> <b>Fund</b> Board (1961–1965), and the Singapore Telephone Board (1965–1966) where he was an assistant secretary. In 1966, the year following Singapore's independence, he joined the University of Singapore as an assistant lecturer. Conducting doctoral research into African poetry in English, he received his Ph.D. from the university in 1970. He became a full professor in the Department of English Language and Literature, heading the department between 1977 and 1993. The University of Singapore and Nanyang University merged in 1980 to form the National University of Singapore (NUS), {{and he was the}} Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences from 1980 to 1991, NUS's longest-serving dean.|$|E

25|$|The Housing Development Board set {{up before}} {{independence}} {{continued to be}} largely successful under Lim Kim San. Huge building projects sprang up to provide cheap, affordable public housing to resettle the squatters, hence removing a serious social problem. 25,000 apartments {{were built in the}} first two years. It was remarkable that, within a decade, {{the majority of the population}} had been housed in HDB apartments. Possible explanations for the otherwise seemingly impossible success was the determination of the government, the large budget allocations, and efforts to eliminate red tape and corruption. In 1968, the Central <b>Provident</b> <b>Fund</b> (CPF) Housing Scheme was introduced to allow residents to use their CPF savings to purchase HDB flats, which gradually increased home ownership in Singapore.|$|E

25|$|In 1991 the Constitution of Singapore was {{amended to}} {{transform}} the office of President, which was previously indirectly elected by Parliament, into an office directly elected by the people. The amendment conferred on the President certain executive functions to block attempts {{by the government of}} the day to draw down past reserves that it did not accumulate. Thus, a guarantee may only be given or a loan raised by the Government if the President concurs, and his approval is also needed for budgets of specified statutory boards and Government companies that draw on their past reserves. The President also possesses personal discretion to withhold assent to any bill in Parliament providing directly or indirectly for the direct or indirect variation, changing or increase in powers of the Central <b>Provident</b> <b>Fund</b> Board to invest moneys belonging to it; and the borrowing of money, the giving of any guarantee or the raising of any loan by the Government if in the President's opinion the bill is likely to draw on reserves not accumulated by the Government during its current term of office. In addition, the President may withhold assent to any Supply Bill, Supplementary Supply Bill or Final Supply Bill for any financial year if in his opinion the estimates of revenue and expenditure, supplementary estimates or statement of excess are likely to lead to a drawing on past reserves.|$|E
25|$|As {{the fiscal}} {{guardian}} for the nation's past reserves (that is, reserves not accumulated by the Government during its current term of office), the President's concurrence {{is required for}} a number of financial transactions that the Government may wish to enter into. A guarantee may only be given or a loan raised by the Government if the President concurs, whether the transaction is authorized by a resolution of Parliament or is made under one of eight specified statutes. The President's approval is also needed for budgets of specified statutory boards and Government companies that draw on their past reserves. The statutory boards that come under the President's purview are the Central <b>Provident</b> <b>Fund</b> Board (CPF Board), the Housing and Development Board, JTC Corporation and the Monetary Authority of Singapore, while the Government companies are the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation Pte. Ltd., MND Holdings Pte. Ltd., and Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd. Before the start of its financial year, every statutory board and {{the board of directors of}} every Government company must present its budget for that financial year to the President, together with a declaration by the statutory board's chairman and chief executive officer (CEO), or the Government company's chairman of the board of directors and the CEO, as to whether the budget is likely to draw upon past reserves. If so, the President may exercise personal discretion to disapprove the budget. If he approves the budget even though he is of the opinion that the budget is likely to draw upon past reserves, the decision and opinion must be published in the Government Gazette. Similarly, statutory boards and Government companies are bound to inform the President of financial transactions that are likely to draw on past reserves, and the President has personal discretion as to whether such transactions should be approved.|$|E

40|$|Pension {{reform has}} been on the social policy agenda in many {{countries}} throughout the world since the mid- 1980 s. The main debate has been whether to transform existing defined benefit pay-as-you-go (PAYG) social insurance programs into private pension plans based on defined contributions or maintains them. While many countries throughout the world especially those in Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe have opted for private pensions involving the partial or full replacement of pay-as-you-go (PAYG) state pensions by systems of privately managed individual retirement accounts, pension reforms in English-speaking Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) countries have focused on converting post-independence defined contributions schemes known as <b>provident</b> <b>funds</b> into defined benefit PAYG social insurance schemes particularly from the 1990 s. This paper analyzes the previous experience of English-speaking SSA countries with <b>provident</b> <b>funds</b> and show that pension plans that are designed on the principles of defined contribution are evidently venerable to several socio-economic and political factors especially in the context of developing countries. The paper provides useful lessons for countries like Ghana and Nigeria that have recently re-introduce defined contribution pension plans.
