50|$|Other {{developments}} {{applied to}} the Engine included plate chain to connect to the arch heads of the beam, rather than the earlier link chains. The Engine's valves were replaced with drop valves, operated by a rack and pinion driven from the arbor, worked by horns and tappets on the moving vertical <b>plug</b> <b>rod.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The term {{is first}} {{recorded}} {{as part of}} the valve gear of Thomas Newcomen's atmospheric beam engine, a precursor to the steam engine. The first Newcomen engines had manually worked valves, but within a few years, by 1715, this repetitive task had been automated. The beam of the engine had a vertical 'plug rod' hung from it, alongside the cylinder. Adjustable blocks or 'tappets' were attached to this rod and as the beam moved up and down, the tappets pressed against long levers or 'horns' attached to the engine's valves, working the cycle of steam and injection water valves to operate the engine. [...] This operation by tappets on a <b>plug</b> <b>rod</b> continued into the early twentieth century with the Cornish engine.|$|E

30|$|There was no {{significant}} difference in fracture rate; there were two fractures in the manual group (5  %) and one fracture in the motorized group (4  %). There were four different mechanical failures in the motorized group: dead batteries, a bent <b>plug,</b> a bent <b>rod</b> and a motor that failed because of torque. The unexpected battery failures were caused by excessively high chlorine levels in the rehabilitation facility swimming pool that dissolved the neoprene seals. All of these problems were diagnosed quickly, the failures were repaired and the lengthening procedures were continued.|$|R
30|$|Few {{experiments}} on samples equilibrated at standard environmental conditions (temperature 20  °C and 65 % relative humidity) were performed by Pizzo et al. [8] for Norway spruce and Iroko to compare αlon and αtrasv of wood {{with those of}} different adhesives. The MC value was kept fairly constant during the measurement, as the sample {{was included in the}} quartz cylinder of the dilatometer <b>plug</b> with a <b>rod</b> that limited the exchanges of moisture. Results for Norway spruce indicated that αtrasv varied between 28 [*]×[*] 10 − 6  K- 1 and 32 [*]×[*] 10 − 6  K- 1, while αlon was not significant. The problem of keeping MC constant was again in evidence as a limit of this kind of research, consequently results could be affected by errors.|$|R
50|$|The {{valve gear}} (or 'working gear') of a Newcomen or Cornish engine {{is based on}} the <b>plug</b> <b>rod.</b> This is a {{vertical}} rod, hung from the beam, and moving in parallel to the piston. Adjustable tappets are attached to this rod. These tappets strike long curved iron levers or 'horns' that are carried on three horizontal shafts or 'arbors'. Each arbor works one of the engine's valves. For the Cornish cycles, these valves are the upper steam inlet {{to the top of the}} cylinder, the equilibrium valve that links upper and lower portions of the cylinder, and the lower exhaust and condensing water injection valves, which share an arbor. Unlike most other steam engines, these engines could be run intermittently: making a single stroke before stopping and waiting for the valves to be restarted again. The speed of each power stroke or 'coming indoors' was a feature of the engine and was not easily varied, but there was no need for the engines to run continuously, stroke after stroke. This was a direct contrast to the rotative beam engine, and the rotary nature of almost all other steam engines. With the original Newcomen cycle, the speed of the return stroke varied according to the boiler pressure, although this still did not affect the strength or speed of the power stroke.|$|E

2500|$|The {{thermonuclear}} burn {{would produce}} (like the fission fuel in the primary) pulsations (generations) of high-energy neutrons {{with an average}} temperature of 14 MeV through Jetter's cycle. The cycle {{is a combination of}} endothermic and exothermic neutronic reactions involving lithium and deuterium/tritium. The reaction's neutronicity was estimated at ~0.885 (for a Lawson criterion of ~1.5). These figures do not count the Li isotope, where the LiD has a neutronicity of ~0.835 and, along with the cross-sections, were given as group averages from about 2.40 to approximately 2.55 MeV and from 14.0 to 14.1 MeV; the small power group is not statistically present (see also Nuclear fusion). As SHRIMP, along with the RUNT I and ALARM CLOCK were to be high-yield shots required to assure the thermonuclear [...] "emergency capability", their fusion fuel may have been spiked with additional tritium, in the form of LiT. All of the high-energy 14 MeV neutrons would cause fission in the uranium fusion tamper wrapped around the secondary and the spark <b>plug's</b> plutonium <b>rod.</b> The ratio of deuterium (and tritium) atoms burned by 14 MeV neutrons spawned by the burning was expected to vary from 5:1 to 3:1, a standardisation derived from Mike, while for these estimations, the ratio of 3:1 was predominantly used in ISRINEX. The neutronicity of the fusion reactions harnessed by the fusion tamper would dramatically increase the yield of the device.|$|R
40|$|AbstractSodium cooled {{fast breeder}} {{reactors}} constitute {{the second stage}} of India's three -stage nuclear energy programme, for effective utilization of the country's limited reserves of natural uranium and exploitation of its large reserves of thorium. The Fast Breeder Test Reactor (FBTR) at Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research (IGCAR), Kalpakkam, is a loop type, sodium cooled fast reactor. Its main aim is to provide experience in fast reactor operation, large scale sodium handling and to serve as a test bed for irradiation of fast reactor fuels & materials. FBTR was built on the lines of the French Rapsodie-Fortissimo reactor, with modifications to make it a generating plant. FBTR went critical on 18 th Oct 1985 with a small core of 22 fuel subassemblies of a unique, high Pu carbide fuel. The core was rated for 10. 5 MWt. The TG was rolled and synchronized to the grid in July 1997. Reactor power was progressively increased by enlarging the core, to reach 18. 6 MWt. Several challenges in reactor operation came on the way, which were successfully overcome. A large number of modifications were carried out to improve the plant performance. The reactor coolant used (Sodium) is highly reactive when exposed to atmosphere and also becomes highly active on exposure to neutron radiation. These properties of sodium make it essential to handle it carefully and safely within a leak tight containment. During course of operation of the reactor, a number of sodium laden components viz. pumps, valves, cold traps, Rupture discs, level probes, shielding <b>plugs,</b> control <b>rod</b> drive mechanisms, experimental assemblies, piping etc. are required to be removed for various maintenance, modification and replacement jobs. This paper details the experience with operation and maintenance of India's only one fast reactor power station...|$|R
40|$|The {{balancing}} of a {{wind turbine}} rotor {{is a crucial}} step affecting the machine’s performance, reliability, and safety, as it directly impacts the dynamic loads on the entire structure. A rotor can be balanced either statically or dynamically. A method of rotor balancing was developed that achieves both the simplicity of static balancing and the accuracy of dynamic balancing. This method is best suited, but not limited, to hollow composite blades of any size. The method starts by quantifying the mass and center of gravity of each blade. A dynamic calculation is performed to determine the theoretical shaking force on the rotor shaft at the design operating speed. This force is converted to a net counterbalance mass required for each blade. Despite the most careful methodology, there may still be large errors associated with these measurements and calculations. Therefore, this new method includes a physical verification of each blade’s individual balance against all other blades on the rotor, {{with the ability to}} quantify the discrepancy between blades, and make all balance adjustments in situ. The balance weights are aluminum plugs of varying lengths inserted into the root of each blade with a threaded steel rod running through the middle. The balance adjustment is thus not visible from outside. The weight of the <b>plug</b> and <b>rod</b> represent the coarse counterbalance of each blade, based on the dynamic calculations. The threaded steel rod acts as a fine adjustment on the blades’ mass moment when traveled along the plug. A dedicated blade-balance apparatus, designed and constructed in-house, is used to verify and fine-tune each individual blade and compare it to all other blades on the rotor. The resulting blade assembly is verified on a full rotor static balancing apparatus. The full rotor apparatus measures the steady state tilt of the rotor when balanced on a point. Next, the rotors 2 ̆ 7 tilt is related to its overall level of imbalance with quantifiable error. Most error {{comes from the fact that}} the hub, comparable in mass to the blades, creates a false righting moment of the assembly not present in operation. The fully assembled rotor is tested, pre and post balance, in operation on the turbine at a series of predetermined speeds. This is accomplished with a 3 -axis accelerometer mounted on the main turbine shaft bearing and a control system which regulates and records turbine speed at 100 H...|$|R

The {{ceramic composite}} material used, contains {{three or more}} ceramic components. The base compound is silicon nitride, SiAlON or aluminum nitride. Electrical conductivity is modified using two or more ceramics. The first comprises one or more electrically-conducting metal silicide(s) selected from Mo, W, Ta, Nb, Ti, Zr, Hf, V and Cr. The second is of lesser electrical conductivity. The proportions of these components, determine electrical conductivity. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The second ceramic component is silicon carbide or B 4 C. At least one sintering additive is included. The proportions of silicide in the electrically-conducting and electrically-insulating ceramic composite materials, differ by at most 10 wt% and lie below the percolation threshold. The element is formed using silicon nitride, molybdenum silicide, silicon carbide and a sintering additive. The electrically-conductive ceramic components form an electrically-conducting network structure within {{the volume of the}} ceramic basic component. Electrical conductivity is determined by the proportion of the second component. None of the components in the composition is formed reactively, during sintering. USE - A ceramic electrical heating element used in e. g. glow <b>plugs</b> or heating <b>rods.</b> ADVANTAGE - It is possible to pre-determine and adjust the electrical conductivity of the heating element over a wide range. During sintering at high temperatures, and during use for heating, virtually no internal stressing is induced. The ceramic materials SiC, B 4 C, are selected for the similarity of their thermo-physical properties to those of silicon nitride. Manufacture is facilitated. Because of the absence of damaging internal stresses, product reliability and life are increased...|$|R
40|$|International audienceResistance {{butt welding}} (RBW) {{is the main}} process used by AREVA to weld end <b>plugs</b> to fuel <b>rod</b> cladding. The {{combination}} of current, electrical resistivity of the plug–cladding contact, and applied pressure is set so as to weld the parts without fusion of the materials. Because this is a solid state welding process, one of its main advantages is that the corrosion behavior of the welds is very good, {{because it is not}} affected by any potential contamination from the welding atmosphere or other components. The RBW welds are geometrically characterized by plastic deformation of the welded interface that depends on process parameters such as applied current and pressure, welding time, and initial geometry of the parts. Microstructural evolutions and extension of the heat-affected zones are also consequences of these parameters. In order to better understand the multiphysical phenomena involved during the very short welding time of this process, numerical modeling of RBW was developed. The model is also very useful for investigating new configurations and further optimizing weld quality with a reduced number of welding samples. The RBW numerical model was implemented within the finite element code FORGE, and electrical phenomena were coupled with thermal and mechanical ones. Mechanical properties of the tube and the plug were described as a function of strain, strain rate, and temperature. The temperature and pressure dependence of the electrical contact resistance were also determined and taken into account. Thanks to a good description of the thermal and mechanical history of the weld, numerical results, such as weld geometry, plastic strain, and heat-affected zones, were in good agreement with experimental ones. The model was primarily used to understand the effects of process parameters on geometry and temperature, but it was also used to optimize welding conditions...|$|R
40|$|A Generation IV Sodium cooled Fast Reactor (SFR) {{is being}} {{researched}} and developed at CEA, Cadarache France under the project named ASTRID. Monitoring gas presence in SFR is important {{with respect to}} its safe operation. In accordance {{with the principles of}} diversity, techniques based on different measurement principles have been proposed. This thesis concerns the detection and characterization of void using magnetic flux perturbation principle. An Eddy Current Flow Meter (ECFM) device is used for this purpose. From the technological point of view, the objective is to evaluate the feasibility of ECFM as a flow and/or void monitoring/characterizing device; and to determine which parameters are of interest and what are the precision of these measurements; and whether it is possible to measure the flow rate and void fraction simultaneously with the same ECFM device. From the physics point of view, the ECFM system involves the magnetic flux perturbation due to voids in the presence of Faraday induction and Lorentz force effects. Therefore ECFM integrated signal contains informations about the void, Faraday induction and Lorentz force effects based perturbation in magnetic flux and their couplings. Our objective is to understand {{the nature and extent of}} these couplings. Specific experiments have been developed to study the effects of flow velocity, void fraction and magnetic flux pulsations on the response of an ECFM. It consists in modeling the two-phase flow by a moving aluminium <b>rod</b> (<b>plug</b> flow) with holes and grooves to simulate voids. Flow velocity range of variation was 0 <U< 1 m/s, void fraction 0 << 6. 9 % and pulsation 1500 << 12000 rad/s (for this range of pulsations the electromagnetic skin depth is of order but smaller than the aluminium rod radius). An ellipse fitting method was proposed to analyze the output signal of the secondary coils. The results show that ECFM is sensitive to void fractions between 0. 3 % and 6. 9 %. Furthermore, the response to void fraction is insensitive to the mean velocity of the twophase medium. A second approach based on demodulation analyses of the secondary coils output signal has been developed. We have proposed a theoretical model based on a first order expansion of magnetic flux in U and a. With this model it was possible to interpret the experimental results in terms of contributions of U and a. Despite the strong coupling between Faraday induction and Lorentz force effects, the results show that the contributions of U and a. can be well separated at low magnetic Reynolds number (Rem < 0. 12) and low a values (< 6. 9 %). A very important result is that the contribution of _ on magnetic flux is insensitive to variations of velocity in this range of Rem. Moreover, different geometries of void have been studied: grooves and holes. It was observed that the geometry of void do not change the variation of magnetic flux with a. This second approach revealed to be more sensitive to void fraction variations than ellipse fitting method. Finally, preliminary experiments with liquid metal galinstan with glass beads were done, which showed sensitivity of ECFM signal with velocity and void. In conclusion, this work has shown that ECFM can measure simultaneously void and velocity in the range of parameters studied, in particular 0. 06 %< < 6. 9 %...|$|R
