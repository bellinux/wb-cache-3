5|$|The plot of Sherlock Holmes Baffled is {{unrelated}} to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's canonical Sherlock Holmes stories; {{it is likely}} that the character's name was used purely for its familiarity with the public. Shot from a single <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>on</b> a stage set, the intention of Sherlock Holmes Baffled was probably to act as a showcase for basic film trickery and film editing effects, particularly the stop trick first developed four years earlier in 1896 by French director Georges Méliès.|$|E
5|$|Petre Vasiliu-Năsturel {{observes that}} from a heraldic <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> <b>on</b> the French {{as well as the}} revolutionary Wallachian flag, the middle stripe {{represents}} a heraldic metal (argent and or respectively). Other writers believe that the tricolor was not an imitation of the French flag, instead embodying an old Romanian tradition. This theory is supported by a note from the revolutionary foreign minister to Emin Pasha: “the colors of the band that we the leaders wear, as well as all our followers, are not of modern origin. We have had our flags since an earlier time. When we received the tricolor insignia and bands we did not follow the spirit of imitation or fashion”.|$|E
5|$|While design {{management}} had {{its origins in}} business schools, it has increasingly become embedded in the curriculum in design schools, particularly at the postgraduate level. Teaching design to managers was pioneered at the London Business School in 1976, and the first programme of {{design management}} at a design school was started in the 1980s at the Royal College of Art (RCA), DeMontfort, Middlesex, Staffordshire. Although, in the UK, some design management courses have not been sustainable, including those at the RCA, Westminster and Middlesex, other postgraduate courses have flourished including ones at Brunel, Lancaster and more recently the University of the Arts with each providing a specific <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>on</b> design management.|$|E

5|$|The {{debate among}} monks unfolds in the {{presence}} of their teachers, with a very well set rules of procedure for the defender and the questioners. The tradition of such debates is traced to the ancient ‘Hindu Orthodoxy’ in India and this practice permeated into Buddhist orthodoxy in Tibet in the eighth century. Such debates usually take place within the monastery’s precincts. The defender has the onus to prove his <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>on</b> the subject proposed for debate. The debate opens with an invocation to Manjushri recited in a loud and high pitched tone. The roles of the debater and the questioner are well defined; the questioner has to succinctly present his case (all on Buddhism related topics) and the defender has to answer within a fixed time frame. The finality of the debate is with specific answers like: “I accept (do), the reason is not established (ta madrup) or there is no pervasion (Kyappa majung)”. Many a time, the questions mooted are meant to mislead the defender. If the defender does not reply within a time frame, an expression of derision is witnessed. In the Tibetan debating sessions, there is no role for a witness and there is normally no adjudicator. This leads to “conflicting opinions of participants and listeners.” When there is direct contradiction on the defenders part, the outcome is, however, formally decided.|$|E

25|$|What we call {{religious}} {{experiences can}} differ greatly. Some reports exist of supernatural happenings {{that it would}} be difficult to explain from a rational, scientific <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, there also exist the sort of testimonies that simply seem to convey a feeling of peace or oneness – something which most of us, religious or not, may possibly relate to. In categorizing religious experiences it is perhaps helpful to look at them as explicable through one of two theories: the Objectivist thesis or the Subjectivist thesis.|$|E
25|$|If one adopts the {{classical}} <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>on</b> categories, {{that there is}} a set of morphisms from one object to another (not just a class), then one has to give an additional argument to prove this. If, for example, the abelian category A is small, i.e. has only a set of objects, then this issue will be no problem. Also, if A is a Grothendieck abelian category, then the derived category D(A) is equivalent to a full subcategory of the homotopy category K(A), and hence has only a set of morphisms from one object to another. Grothendieck abelian categories include the category of modules over a ring, the category of sheaves of abelian groups on a topological space, and many other examples.|$|E
25|$|This {{story told}} by Llandovery Castle {{survivors}} was extensively publicized as World War I propaganda throughout the United Kingdom, Canada, and the U.S.A. during the remaining {{months of the}} war. The victorious Allies believed Patzig was a war criminal, but left the task of prosecution to the former commander's fellow citizens. By returning, in 1921, to his place of birth in the Free City of Danzig, Brümmer-Patzig evaded {{the jurisdiction of the}} German courts, and pre-empted court proceedings against him. The indictment against Patzig was quashed in absentia in 1931 as an acknowledgment by the German courts of the enactment, by the Reichstag, of two laws of amnesty that applied to his case. Thus, no testimony was taken {{in a court of law}} to set forth Patzig's <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>on</b> the atrocity.|$|E

25|$|Clara Barton {{became an}} {{educator}} in 1838 for 12 years in schools in Canada and West Georgia. Barton fared {{well as a}} teacher and knew how to handle rambunctious children, particularly the boys, since as a child she enjoyed her male cousins' and brothers' company. She learned how to act like them, making it easier for her to relate to and control the boys in her classroom since they respected her. After her mother's death in 1851, the family home closed down. Barton decided to further her education by pursuing writing and languages at the Clinton Liberal Institute in New York. In this college town, she developed many friendships that broadened her <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>on</b> many issues concurring at the time. The principal of the institute recognized her tremendous abilities and admired her work. This friendship lasted for many years, eventually turning into a romance. As a writer, her terminology was pristine and easy to understand. Her writings and bodies of work could instruct the local statesmen. No one could exceed her outstanding service to humanity in war and in peace.|$|E

500|$|In 2011, the French {{conservative}} media Nouvelles de France {{revealed that}} Jonathan Krohn was not conservative anymore. In 2012, he confirmed to Politico {{that he no}} longer considers himself a conservative, and in fact takes a liberal <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>on</b> many issues, including same-sex marriage and the Affordable Care Act. He also said that if he were old enough to vote in the 2012 presidential election, he would vote for Barack Obama. However, he refused to describe himself as liberal, instead rejecting ideological labels entirely. Krohn attributes his change to reading works of philosophers such as Nietzsche and Wittgenstein. He said that he rejected social conservatism first, before rejecting other conservative viewpoints. Krohn stated that he had matured and described his 13-year-old self as [...] "naive".|$|E

Caine describes Cutter as [...] "a teacher, a father and a guide to Angier". Caine, in trying to create Cutter's nuanced portrait, altered his voice and posture. Nolan later said that [...] "Michael Caine’s character really becomes something of the heart of the film.

500|$|In a 2012 interview, Vladimir Kramnik {{stated that}} Carlsen's [...] "excellent {{physical}} shape" [...] was {{a contributing factor}} to his success against other top players as it prevents [...] "psychological lapses", which enables Carlsen to maintain a high standard of play over long games {{and at the end}} of tournaments, when the energy levels of others have dropped. Tyler Cowen gave a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>on</b> Carlsen's playing style: [...] "Carlsen is demonstrating one of his most feared qualities, namely his 'nettlesomeness,' to use a term coined for this purpose by Ken Regan. Using computer analysis, you can measure which players do the most to cause their opponents to make mistakes. Carlsen has the highest nettlesomeness score by this metric, because his creative moves pressure the other player and open up a lot of room for mistakes. In contrast, a player such as Kramnik plays a high percentage of very accurate moves, and of course he is very strong, but those moves are in some way calmer and they are less likely to induce mistakes in response." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike Stewart, who {{essentially}} hosted The Daily Show as himself, Colbert {{developed a}} correspondent character for his {{pieces on the}} series. Colbert has described his correspondent character as [...] "a fool who has {{spent a lot of}} his life playing not the fool– one who is able to cover it at least well enough to deal with the subjects that he deals with". Colbert was frequently pitted against knowledgeable interview subjects, or against Stewart in scripted exchanges, with the resultant dialogue demonstrating the character's lack of knowledge of whatever subject he is discussing. Colbert also made generous use of humorous fallacies of logic in explaining his <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>on</b> any topic. Other Daily Show correspondents have adopted a similar style; former correspondent Rob Corddry recalls that when he and Ed Helms first joined the show's cast in 2002, they [...] "just imitated Stephen Colbert for a year or two". Correspondent Aasif Mandvi has stated [...] "I just decided I was going to do my best Stephen Colbert impression".|$|E
