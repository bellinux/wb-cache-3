40|$|We {{describe}} {{a very sensitive}} method to detect as antigens the presence of specific proteins within phage plaques or bacterial colonies. We <b>coat</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>sheets</b> with antibody molecules, expose the sheet to lysed bacteria so that a released antigen can bind, and then label the immobilized antigen with radioiodinated antibodies. Thus, the antigen is sandwiched between the antibodies attached to the plastic sheet and those carrying the radioactive label. Autoradiography then shows the positions of antigen-containing colonies or phage plaques. A few molecules of antigen released from each bacterial cell generatean adequate signal...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{the effect of}} various substrata on the {{settlement}} of a pearl oyster, Pinctada martensii, was evaluated. The settlement of the larvae in the experiments with four different color substrata was compared and showed that deep color plastic sheets (red and blue) attracted significantly more larvae (P < 0. 05) than light color (green and yellow). In addition, the influence of biofilm substrata was {{compared with that of}} non-film substrata of smooth or rough texture. Number of settled larvae was highest on biofilmed plastic sheets, either rough or smooth, then rough plastic sheets without film, the least recorded was on smooth plastic sheets without biofilm. Substrates of <b>plastic</b> <b>sheets</b> <b>coated</b> with tissue extracts of the same species appeared to attract larval settlement. The number of settled larvae on substrates with tissue extracts was significantly greater (P < 0. 05) than that on the control. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
5000|$|The {{speakers}} use a thin flat diaphragm usually {{consisting of}} a <b>plastic</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>coated</b> with a conductive material such as graphite sandwiched between two electrically conductive grids, with a small air gap between the diaphragm and grids. For low distortion operation, the diaphragm must operate with a constant charge on its surface, rather than with a constant voltage (charge and voltage {{are not the same}} thing). This is accomplished by either or both of two techniques: the diaphragm's conductive coating is chosen and applied in a manner to give it a very high surface resistivity, and/or a large value resistor is placed in series between the EHT (Extra High Tension or Voltage) power supply and the diaphragm (resistor not shown in the diagram here). However, the latter technique will still allow distortion as the charge will migrate across the diaphragm to the point closest to the [...] "grid" [...] or electrode thereby increasing the force moving the diaphragm, this will occur at audio frequency so the diaphragm requires a high resistance (megohms) to slow the movement of charge for a practical speaker.|$|R
40|$|The memristor (a memory-resistor) is a {{fundamental}} two-terminal circuit element with a nonlinear relationship between the integral of the voltage and the charge. In the literature, the research interest {{in the development of}} new memristive systems is growing, due to the potential applications as analog memories or as synapses in neuromorphic systems. In this paper, the possibility of using an electrostatic loudspeaker as a memristor-based system is explored. This kind of loudspeakers use a thin flat polarized diaphragm, usually consisting of a <b>plastic</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>coated</b> with a conductive material, between two electrically conductive plates, with a small air gap between them. When an electrostatic field is applied to the plates, a force is exerted on the charged diaphragm, and its resulting movement drives the air on either side of it. To get a memristor, the deformation of the diaphragm is here converted in a resistance value using a strain gauge attached over it. A mathematical model of the system is developed. Simulation results show that the device based on the combination of an electrostatic loudspeaker and a strain gauge has all the properties of the memristive system...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to study the effect of pigment volume {{concentration}} on enzyme activity by using two different kinds of pigments (kaolin clay and calcium carbonate) in various concentrations. The coating colors were coated on various kinds of substrates for the different methods including flexible paper, board and <b>plastic</b> film. All <b>coating</b> colors contained a latex of standard grade, starch, pigment and the chemical compound used by enzyme, in this case β-D-glucose. The paper substrate used was a white top kraft liner with a grammage of 140 g/m 2, while the board had a grammage of 244 g/m 2. The plastic film used was a standard Mylar film. All coating colors with various amounts of the two pigments (without enzyme) were coated on the paper and board substrates. The resulting coat weight and the thermal conductivity were measured. The Cobb-Unger oil absorbency was evaluated using double <b>coated</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>sheets</b> for different pigment volume concentrations of the two pigments. The oxygen scavenging ability of the enzyme in the various coating colors coated on the barrier board was also evaluated. For the determination of enzyme activity, glucose oxidase, catalase and glucose were added to latex dispersions {{in the preparation of}} the coating colors. The enzymes were entrapped in the coating layers after coating and drying. The activity of enzyme incorporated in the coating dispersions was compared for the two different pigments. The results indicated that the pigment concentration had a significant effect on the enzyme activity...|$|R
40|$|Polymer <b>coated</b> <b>sheet</b> metal {{components}} find diverse applications in many industries. The manufacturing {{of the components}} generally involves forming of sheet metal into the desired shape and coating of the formed part with organic coating. An alternative manufacturing route is to <b>coat</b> the <b>sheet</b> metal first before forming. The change in the manufacturing sequence can potentially improve cost and reduce environmental impact. This approach, however, requires the coating to survive the deformation process. Thus, the effect of <b>plastic</b> deformation on <b>coating</b> adhesion is of primary interest to many engineers and researchers. This research aims at developing a methodology to predict the adhesion of coating after metal forming processes. A pull-off apparatus that measures the coating pull-off stress was used to indicate the coating adhesion strength. Several types of specimen were designed to obtain uniaxial tension, biaxial tension, and tension-compression deformation modes on pre-coated sheet by using a uniaxial tensile tester. Experimental results from two selected polymer <b>coated</b> <b>sheet</b> metals show that coating adhesion was affected by plastic deformation. An analytical model based on a virtual interface crack concept was developed to indicate the adhesion potential of the coating-substrate interface. From interfacial fracture mechanics, the initial adhesion potential {{is defined as the}} energy release rate characterized by the virtual interface crack and the initial pull-off stress. The analytical model was used to predict coating adhesion loss after deformation in uniaxial tension mode. The analytical model predictions agreed well with experimental results. Finite element analysis tool was applied to simulate more complex deformation modes in stamping of <b>coated</b> <b>sheet</b> meals. The stress field near the interface crack tip was used to calculate the energy release rate and predict the adhesion loss under different deformation modes. The predictions obtained from numerical method are also in good agreements with the experimental results in biaxial tension and tension-compression modes. The research has led {{to a better understanding of}} the effects of <b>plastic</b> deformation on <b>coating</b> adhesion. The developed adhesion test methods can be used to generate useful information on coating durability for diverse practical use. It is also expected that the results of the research will facilitate the development of better polymer <b>coated</b> <b>sheet</b> metal to be used in sheet metal forming processes...|$|R
