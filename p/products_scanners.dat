Such proceeding allows e. g. for optimizing product placements or in-store advertising and guidance.

50|$|In {{addition}} to complaints that DFC {{may be a}} <b>product</b> of <b>scanner</b> noise, observed DFC could be criticized based on the indirect nature of fMRI {{which is used to}} observe it. fMRI data is collected by quickly acquiring a sequence of MRI images in time using echo planar imaging. The contrast in these images is heavily influenced by the ratio of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. Since active neurons require more energy than resting neurons, changes in this contrast is traditionally interpreted an indirect measure of neural activity. Because of its indirect nature, fMRI data in DFC studies could be criticized as potentially being a reflection of non neural information. This concern has been alleviated recently by the observed correlation between fMRI DFC and simultaneously acquired electrophysiology data.|$|R

40|$|Sales {{of organic}} milk in {{mainstream}} supermarkets have grown {{over the last}} 8 years, reaching $ 75. 7 million in 1999, as more organic milk processors enter the market and more mainstream supermarkets sell organic <b>products.</b> National-level <b>scanner</b> data for mainstream supermarkets are employed to assess market shares and price premiums, {{as well as to}} estimate key demand elasticities. Container size is important in analyzing market shares for organics. Half-gallon containers are the principle organic market with volume shares ranging from 1. 6 % to 2. 8 % in 1999. Market shares for quarts and gallons of organic milk are considerably below 0. 5 %. Price premiums for organic milk averaged 60 % of branded prices and 75 % of private-label prices during the study period (November 1996 -December 1999). Own-price elasticities suggest considerable response to lower organic prices, although the magnitude of this response declines as expenditure shares increase in later months. Cross-price elasticities indicate that organic and branded milks are usually substitutes but with considerable asymmetry in responses; branded prices affect organic purchases much more than the converse. Expenditure elasticities for organic milk imply that as milk expenditures decline, quantities purchased of organic milk will increase. Jointly, the elasticities suggest considerable response to changing retail prices. organic foods, beverage milk, almost ideal demand system, Demand and Price Analysis,...|$|R

We first present several facts about price and quantity changes over the <b>product</b> cycle employing <b>scanner</b> data for Japan for the years 1988 - 2013, which cover the deflationary period that started in the mid 1990 s. We then develop a new method to decompose price changes {{at the time of}} product turnover into those due to the quality effect and those due to the fashion effect (i. e., the higher demand for products that are new). Our main findings are as follows: (i) the price and quantity of a new product tend to be higher than those of its predecessor at its exit from the market, implying that Japanese firms use new products as an opportunity to take back the price decline that occurred during the life of its predecessor under deflation; (ii) a considerable fashion effect exists, while the quality effect is slightly declining; and (iii) the discrepancy between the cost-of- living index estimated based on our methodology and the price index constructed only from a matched sample is not large. Our study provides a plausible story to explain why Japan's deflation during the lost decades was mild. 2012 ～ 2016 年度科学研究費補助金[基盤研究(S) ]「長期デフレの解明」(研究代表者 東京大学経済学研究科・渡辺努, 課題番号： 24223003...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine how}} {{precisely}} one can reproduce the CPI constructed based on price surveys using scanner data. Specifically, we closely follow the procedure {{adopted by the}} Statistics Bureau of Japan when we sample outlets, products, and prices from our scanner data and aggregate them to construct a scanner data-based price index. We show that the following holds the key to precise replication of the CPI. First, the scanner databased index crucially depends on how often one replaces the <b>products</b> sampled. The <b>scanner</b> data index shows a substantial deviation from the actual CPI when one chooses a value for the parameter associated with product replacement such that replacement occurs frequently, but the deviation becomes much smaller if one picks a parameter value such that product replacement occurs only infrequently. Second, even when products are replaced only infrequently, the scanner data index differs significantly from the actual CPI in terms of volatility. The standard deviation of the scanner data-based monthly inflation rate is 1. 54 percent, {{which is more than}} three times as large as that for actual CPI inflation. We decompose the difference in volatility between the two indexes into various factors, showing that it mainly stems from the difference in price rigidity for individual products. We propose a filtering technique to make individual prices in the scanner data stickier, thereby making scanner data-based inflation less volatile. 2012 ～ 2016 年度科学研究費補助金[基盤研究(S) ]「長期デフレの解明」(研究代表者 東京大学経済学研究科・渡辺努, 課題番号： 24223003...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{one-dimensional}} differential {{pulse code}} modulation, the coder is multiplication-free, codes each pixel {{as soon as}} it is available, and outputs a fixed number of bits for each pixel. Hence, {{there is no need for}} any buffering of the input image or coder output bitstream. The compression scheme is visually lossless and yields a modest compression ratio of 3 to 4. Because of its simplicity, it is useful when hardware is limited and coding delays cannot be tolerated. There is often a need for some level of data compression in many imaging devices and <b>products,</b> such as <b>scanners</b> and facsimile machines. The reason can be the limited bandwidth of the data bus connecting the scanner to the host computer or the size of the memory available in the product. In addition, strict hardware limitations can preclude the use of compression schemes that are computationally intensive. A desirable feature of a compression scheme is that it be a fixed-rate coder. Specifically, it is desirable for the compression scheme to produce the same number of bits in compressing an 8. 5 -by- 11 -inch sheet of paper regardless of its content. This guarantees that the memory of the device will never overflow and that the data is always transmitted to the host in a fixed time. Many popular compression schemes, such as the lossy JPEG and its newly adopted lossless JPEG-LS algorithms, are variable-rate coders. They have the advantage that they yield higher compression ratios than fixed-rate coders of comparable complexity. However, their variable-rate nature implies that in compressing a sheet of paper, there can be a large variation in the number of bits they generate, depending on the content of the sheet. In this paper we present a very simple compression scheme that adequately addresses all the issues raised above. It compresses a given sheet of pape...|$|R
