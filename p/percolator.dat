25|$|The type of grind {{is often}} {{named after the}} brewing method {{for which it is}} {{generally}} used. Turkish grind is the finest grind, while coffee <b>percolator</b> or French press are the coarsest grinds. The most common grinds are between these two extremes: a medium grind is used in most home coffee-brewing machines.|$|E
25|$|A coffee <b>percolator</b> {{is a type}} of pot used to brew coffee. In {{the case}} of coffee-brewing the solvent is water, the {{permeable}} substance is the coffee grounds, and the soluble constituents are the chemical compounds that give coffee its color, taste, and aroma. In 1806, Benjamin Thompson Rumford invented the percolating coffee pot with a metal sieve to strain away the grounds.|$|E

50|$|Once ideal yield {{has been}} reached, the grounds {{must be removed}} from the liquid, {{otherwise}} extraction continues and the coffee will grow increasingly over-extracted.

60|$|The Babbitts' {{house was}} five years old. It was all as {{competent}} and glossy as this bedroom. It had the best of taste, the best of inexpensive rugs, a simple and laudable architecture, and the latest conveniences. Throughout, electricity took the place of candles and slatternly hearth-fires. Along the bedroom baseboard were three plugs for electric lamps, concealed by little brass doors. In the halls were plugs for the vacuum cleaner, and in the living-room plugs for the piano lamp, for the electric fan. The trim dining-room (with its admirable oak buffet, its leaded-glass cupboard, its creamy plaster walls, its modest scene of a salmon expiring upon a pile of oysters) had plugs which supplied the electric <b>percolator</b> and the electric toaster.|$|E
60|$|On {{his next}} call {{there was a}} lively Ruth who invited {{him up to the}} library, read {{extracts}} from Stephen Leacock's Nonsense Novels; turned companionably serious, and told him how divided were her sympathies between her father--the conscientiously worried employer--and a group of strikers in his factory. She made coffee in a fantastic <b>percolator,</b> and played Débussy and ragtime. At ten-thirty, the hour at which he had vehemently resolved to go, they were curled in two big chairs eating chocolate peppermints and talking of themselves apropos of astronomy and the Touricar and Lincoln Beachey's daring and Mason Winslow and patriotism and Joralemon. Ruth's father drifted in from his club at a quarter to eleven. Carl now met him for the first time. He was a large-stomached, bald, sober, friendly man, with a Gladstone collar, a huge watch-chain, kindly trousers and painfully smart tan boots, a father of the kind who gives cigars and non-committal encouragement to daughter's suitors.|$|E

50|$|Coffee can be brewed {{in several}} {{different}} ways, but these methods fall into four main groups {{depending on how the}} water is introduced to the coffee grounds: decoction (through boiling), infusion (through steeping), gravitational feed (used with <b>percolators</b> and in drip brewing), or pressurized percolation (as with espresso).|$|R

40|$|Anelastic light {{scattering}} is computed numerically for model disordered systems (linear chains and 2 -dimensional site and bond <b>percolators),</b> {{with and without}} electrical disorder. A {{detailed analysis of the}} vibrational modes and of their Raman activity evidences that two extreme mechanisms for scattering may be singled out. One of these resembles scattering from finite size systems, while the other mechanisms originates from spatial fluctuations of the polarizability and is such that modes in even small frequency intervals may have very different Raman activities. As a consequence, the average coupling coefficient C(ω) is the variance of a zero-average quantity. Our analysis shows that for both linear chains and 2 -dimensional <b>percolators</b> the second mechanism dominates over the first, and therefore Raman scattering from disordered systems is essentially due to spatial fluctuations.

5000|$|The {{method for}} making coffee in a <b>percolator</b> had changed very little since the {{introduction}} of the electric <b>percolator</b> {{in the early part of}} the 20th century. However, in 1970 commercially available [...] "ground coffee filter rings” were introduced to the market. The coffee filter rings were designed for use in percolators, and each ring contained a pre-measured amount of coffee grounds that were sealed in a self-contained paper filter. The sealed rings resembled the shape of a doughnut, and the small hole in the middle of the ring enabled the coffee filter ring to be placed in the metal <b>percolator</b> basket around the protruding convection (<b>percolator)</b> tube.|$|E
50|$|A {{distinction}} must be {{made between}} the chemical process of percolation and the coffee <b>percolator</b> as a device. In 1880, Hanson Goodrich invented the coffee <b>percolator.</b> His <b>percolator</b> {{was one of the}} earliest coffee brewing devices to use percolation rather than infusion or decoction as its mode of extraction, and he named it accordingly. Other brewing methods based on percolation followed, and this early naming convention can cause confusion with other percolation methods.|$|E
50|$|A coffee <b>percolator</b> {{consists}} of a pot with a small chamber at the bottom which is placed closest to the heat source. A vertical tube leads from this chamber {{to the top of}} the <b>percolator.</b> Just below the upper end of this tube is a perforated chamber.|$|E

50|$|These mills offer a {{wide range}} of grind settings, making them {{suitable}} to grind coffee for various brewing systems such as espresso, drip, <b>percolators,</b> French press, and others. Many burr grinders, including almost all domestic versions, are unable to achieve the extremely fine grind required for the preparation of Turkish coffee; traditional Turkish hand grinders are an exception.|$|R

50|$|He {{wanted to}} design a ceramic coffee <b>percolator</b> which was {{electrically}} heated, and consulted Bill Russell.

25|$|Coffee <b>percolators</b> and {{automatic}} coffeemakers brew coffee using gravity. In an automatic coffeemaker, hot water drips onto coffee grounds that {{are held in}} a paper, plastic, or perforated metal coffee filter, allowing the water to seep through the ground coffee while extracting its oils and essences. The liquid drips through the coffee and the filter into a carafe or pot, and the spent grounds are retained in the filter.|$|R
