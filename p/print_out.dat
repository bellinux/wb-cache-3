With {{the help of a}} Game Link Cable, two players can link together and compete in four different types of deathmatch modes, ranging from the standard kill-the-other-person on a pre-set time to the Counter Force mode, where the first player must rescue two hostages while the second player has to guard them. Various multiplayer maps are unlocked as the player progresses through the single player mode. Additionally, {{with the use of the}} optional Transfer Pak, players can use the game's cartridge to alternatively unlock some cheats in its Nintendo 64 counterpart. Players may also use the Game Boy Printer to <b>print</b> <b>out</b> character profiles.|$|E

Instead, Kindles {{at the end of}} their useful life should be recycled.

25|$|Dealing {{with data}} of {{different}} endianness is sometimes termed the NUXI problem. This terminology {{alludes to the}} byte order conflicts encountered while adapting UNIX, which ran on the mixed-endian PDP-11, to a big-endian IBM Series/1 computer. Unix {{was one of the}} first systems to allow the same code to be compiled for platforms with different internal representations. One of the first programs converted was supposed to <b>print</b> <b>out</b> Unix, but on the Series/1 it printed nUxi instead.|$|E

In 1985, a primitive IBM computer and a daisy-wheel printer were acquired, which allowed text to be <b>printed</b> <b>out</b> in justified columns. These columns, <b>printed</b> <b>out</b> in strips, were then pasted up by hand in the old-fashion way.|$|R
25|$|As a {{prescription}} {{is nothing more}} than information among a prescriber, pharmacist and patient, information technology can be applied to it. Existing information technology is adequate to <b>print</b> <b>out</b> prescriptions. Medical information systems in some hospitals do away with prescriptions within the hospital. There are proposals to securely transmit the prescription from the prescriber to the pharmacist using smartcard or the internet. In the United Kingdom a project called the Electronic Transfer of Prescriptions (ETP) within the National Programme for IT (NPfIT) is currently piloting such a scheme between prescribers and pharmacies.|$|E

Since the existing library building can not be expanded due to limited area, an additional library buildings have been developed around the main campus in Shah Alam. Currently, there are thirteen faculty libraries and satellite libraries located {{in the vicinity of}} Shah Alam, Puncak Alam, Puncak Perdana and Sungai Buloh. In 2003, UiTM established electronic distance education, called Virtual Faculty. The faculty can be accessed through the Internet from cyber cafe, office or home. The learner is able to <b>print</b> <b>out</b> the notes, communicate with other students, e-mail, chat and so forth.|$|E
25|$|In Buenos Aires and Salta {{electronic}} voting machines {{were used to}} <b>print</b> <b>out</b> a single unified ballot, with voters able to select different candidates and parties on a touch screen. Other municipalities such as Bariloche opted for a non-electronic single unified ballot. Opposition candidates, including Sergio Massa, Mauricio Macri and Margarita Stolbizer called for the nationwide implementation of a unified ballot and/or {{electronic voting}}, though Massa in particular was more cautious, saying it was more realistic for such a system to be implemented by 2017. The authority in charge of regulating elections rejected changing the system within 2015 since they claimed {{it would be too}} short term to implement the changes and explain to the public how the new system works.|$|E

In the parlance of Perl culture, Perl programmers are known as Perl hackers, and from this derives the practice of writing short programs to <b>print</b> <b>out</b> the phrase [...] "Just another Perl hacker".

500|$|Five {{days before}} the first PS2 release for Kanon, a PS2 printer called Tapis MPR-505 went on sale which enabled the user to <b>print</b> <b>out</b> game screens. Kanon {{was one of the}} three games {{supported}} at launch, the other two being America Ōden Ultra Quiz from DigiCube and Marle de Jigsaw from Nippon Ichi Software. The first PS2 release in 2002 was reviewed by the Japanese video game magazine Famitsu where the game received an overall score of 29/40 (out of the four individual review scores of 7, 8, 7, and 7). Yūichi Suzumoto commented in an interview in March 2001 that he felt the end of Kanons story could be summed up as [...] "the prince and princess live happily ever after. The end," [...] resulting in an ending that does not expand on what could possibly happen afterwards. In the October 2007 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine, poll results for the 50 best bishōjo games were released. Out of 249 titles, Kanon ranked fifth with 71 votes.|$|E
500|$|In 1991, Sackett {{discovered}} a partly-completed manuscript while she researched documents for her book Inside Trek. This prompted her to suggest {{sending it to}} Pocket Books, which held the rights to Star Trek novels at the time, despite the prior agreement with Bantam. Roddenberry was not enthusiastic about the idea, but editor David Stern at Pocket Books was interested {{and wanted to know}} whether Sackett and fellow writer Fred Bronson would be able to expand and complete it. Contract negotiations for the work began in April 1991, during which time Sackett had a version re-typed because no electronic versions were available and the type on the existing <b>print</b> <b>out</b> was faint in places. The writers were dealing with Roddenberry's lawyer Leonard Maizlish, but discussions lasted over six months. Two days after Roddenberry's death on October 24, they were informed that work on the novel would not continue. Sackett said this may have been linked to her dismissal from the [...] television series following Roddenberry's death. Pocket Books brought in Michael Jan Friedman to finish the work, but it was never published.|$|E
500|$|Einstein's {{scientific}} publications {{are listed}} below in four tables: journal articles, book chapters, books and authorized translations. [...] Each publication is {{indexed in the}} first column by its number in the Schilpp bibliography (Albert Einstein: Philosopher–Scientist, pp.694–730) and by its article number in Einstein's Collected Papers. [...] Complete references for these two bibliographies may be found below in the Bibliography section. [...] The Schilpp numbers are used for cross-referencing in the Notes (the final column of each table), since they cover a greater time period of Einstein's life at present. [...] The English translations of titles are generally taken from the published volumes of the Collected Papers. [...] For some publications, however, such official translations are not available; unofficial translations are indicated with a § superscript. Although the tables are presented in chronological order by default, each table can be re-arranged in alphabetical order for any column by the reader clicking on the arrows {{at the top of}} that column. [...] For illustration, to re-order a table by subject—e.g., to group together articles that pertain to [...] "General relativity" [...] or [...] "Specific heats"—one need only click on the arrows in the [...] "Classification and Notes" [...] columns. [...] To <b>print</b> <b>out</b> the re-sorted table, one may print it directly by using the web-browser Print option; the [...] "Printable version" [...] link at the left gives only the default sorting.
