2500|$|Pogor {{was also}} {{a factor in the}} {{rapprochement}} between the Maiorescu Junimists, who had again divorced the Catargiu Conservatives, and the moderate core of the PNL. Although Maiorescu himself rejected a ministerial appointment in the Ion Brătianu administration, he and the other self-styled [...] "moderate conservatives" [...] backed Brătianu's practical foreign policy. In February 1884, he promised that Pogor and other disgruntled Conservatives (Menelas Ghermani, Gheorghe Manu, Anastasie Triandafil etc.) would follow him in proclaiming conditional support for Brătianu. Maiorescu thus saved the government from a likely recall, and was embraced by an enthusiastic Brătianu while the Assembly looked on. The Junimist realignment gave the club a <b>permanent</b> <b>representation</b> at the epicenter of Romanian politics. Maiorescu received accolades from the cabinet and, in the November 1884 election, his men received nine seats in the Assembly, negotiated upon with the PNL, and three more for [...] "independent" [...] members; Pogor, Iacob Negruzzi, Ioan Mire Melik and Ioan Ianov were the Junimist deputies from Iași. As noted by Maiorescu, Pogor was somewhat harder to win over by the PNL's cartel: [...] "Even Pogor, who had favored the reunified opposition, has grown tired of their parties and feels that he should stand with us".|$|E

50|$|For {{the upper}} class of the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, {{diplomatic}} immunity was an easy concept to understand.

As <b>permanent</b> <b>representations</b> evolved, usually on a treaty basis between two powers, they were frequently staffed by relatives of the sovereign or high-ranking nobles.|$|R
