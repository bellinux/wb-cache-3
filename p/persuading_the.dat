5|$|Around {{the turn}} of the 20th century, Newton Heath pulled off a {{significant}} coup by <b>persuading</b> <b>the</b> Manchester Evening News to set up an office at Bank Street. In response to Manchester City's relationship with the Manchester Evening Chronicle, the Heathens' believed that their partnership with the Evening News would cultivate interest in the club, while the newspaper would benefit from increased coverage of football.|$|E
5|$|The Romans and the Pergamese {{arrived at}} the city of Gordium and found it deserted. As they camped there they were met by a {{messenger}} sent by Eposognatus. The messenger reported that Eposognatus had failed in <b>persuading</b> <b>the</b> Galatians not to attack {{and that they were}} mustering nearby in the mountains.|$|E
5|$|Aristagoras {{was also}} {{successful}} in <b>persuading</b> <b>the</b> city of Eretria to send {{assistance to the}} Ionians {{for reasons that are}} not completely clear. Possibly commercial reasons were a factor; Eretria was a mercantile city, whose trade was threatened by Persian dominance of the Aegean. Herodotus suggests that the Eretrians supported the revolt in order to repay the support the Milesians had given Eretria some time previously, possibly referring to the Lelantine War.|$|E
50|$|She also <b>persuaded</b> <b>the</b> Mexican {{government}} {{to set aside}} 10,000 acres for cactus preservation. In 1936, her efforts <b>persuaded</b> <b>the</b> administration of President Roosevelt to designate more than 800,000 acres in the area as the Joshua Tree National Monument.|$|R
50|$|After Brockie's death, a fan {{petition}} {{was started}} to <b>persuade</b> <b>the</b> developers of Mortal Kombat X to include Oderus {{into the game}} {{as a tribute to}} Brockie. In addition, a second petition was made to <b>persuade</b> <b>the</b> developers of Killer Instinct to include Oderus.|$|R
50|$|It was {{probably}} the same Argaeus who thirty-five years later in 359 BC again appeared as a pretender to the throne. He had <b>persuaded</b> <b>the</b> Athenians to support his claim to the Macedonian throne, but Philip II, who had just succeeded to the regency of <b>the</b> kingdom, <b>persuaded</b> <b>the</b> Athenians to remain inactive.|$|R
5|$|Bush {{played a}} {{critical}} role in <b>persuading</b> <b>the</b> United States government to undertake a crash program to create an atomic bomb. When the NDRC was formed, the Committee on Uranium was placed under it, reporting directly to Bush as the Uranium Committee. Bush reorganized the committee, strengthening its scientific component by adding Tuve, George B. Pegram, Jesse W. Beams, Ross Gunn and Harold Urey. When the OSRD was formed in June 1941, the Uranium Committee was again placed directly under Bush. For security reasons, its name was changed to the S-1 Section.|$|E
5|$|Clark left Cambridge {{at the age}} of 18 to {{join the}} Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve as an officer. During initial {{training}} at HMS Collingwood, near Portsmouth, Clark discovered that he was colour blind and only passed the medical examination by <b>persuading</b> <b>the</b> man sitting behind him to whisper the answers to him. Clark served aboard HMS Fleetwood on convoy escort operations in the Atlantic and Mediterranean before attending HMS King Alfred at Hove. Whilst there his colour blindness was discovered and he was banned from seagoing postings.|$|E
5|$|During his term, Marshall focused {{primarily}} on advancing the progressive agenda. He successfully advocated {{the passage of a}} child labor law and anti-corruption legislation. He supported popular election of U.S. Senators, and the constitutional amendment to allow it was ratified by the Indiana General Assembly during his term. He also overhauled the state auditing agencies and claimed to have saved the government millions of dollars. He was unsuccessful in passing the rest of the progressive platform agenda items or <b>persuading</b> <b>the</b> legislature to call a convention to rewrite the state constitution to expand the government's regulatory powers.|$|E
5000|$|For instance, in September 1807, Lewis <b>persuaded</b> <b>the</b> Potawatomie and Sac and Fox {{to attack}} an Osage village; three Osage warriors were killed.

5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath, many people assumed Jack Fingleton, the only full-time journalist on either team, was responsible. This belief {{may have affected}} {{the course of his}} subsequent career. Fingleton later wrote that Donald Bradman, Australia's star batsman and the primary target of Bodyline, was the person who disclosed the story. Bradman always denied this, and continued to blame Fingleton; animosity between the pair continued {{for the rest of their}} lives. Woodfull's earlier public silence on the tactics had been interpreted as approval; the leak was significant in <b>persuading</b> <b>the</b> Australian public that Bodyline was unacceptable.|$|E
5|$|Other translators {{have placed}} much greater weight {{on trying to}} {{convey a sense of}} the poetic forms used by Du Fu. Vikram Seth in Three Chinese Poets uses English-style rhyme schemes, whereas Keith Holyoak in Facing the Moon approximates the Chinese rhyme scheme; both use end-stopped lines and {{preserve}} some degree of parallelism. In The Selected Poems of Du Fu, Burton Watson follows the parallelisms quite strictly, <b>persuading</b> <b>the</b> western reader to adapt to the poems rather than vice versa. Similarly, he deals with the allusion of the later works by combining literal translation with extensive annotation.|$|E
5|$|The reformers' {{propaganda}} {{claimed that}} England had been unified {{as a result}} of the wide acceptance of Benedictinism, and that the movement's greatest benefactor, King Edgar, had played a major role in the unification by his demands for adherence to the Benedictine Rule. Æthelwold probably tutored Edgar as a boy, and was very close to him; it is likely that Æthelwold was influential in <b>persuading</b> <b>the</b> king to carry through his reforms and support Benedictine monasticism. Monks became dominant on the bishops' bench during his reign.|$|E

50|$|Lysander {{still had}} {{influence}} in Sparta despite his setbacks in Athens. He {{was able to}} <b>persuade</b> <b>the</b> Spartans to select Agesilaus II as the new Eurypontid Spartan king {{following the death of}} Agis II, and to <b>persuade</b> <b>the</b> Spartans to support Cyrus the Younger in his unsuccessful rebellion against his older brother, Artaxerxes II of Persia.|$|R
50|$|GNC President Nouri Abusahmain visited Zeidan and his kidnappers {{for some}} 20 minutes, {{attempting}} to <b>persuade</b> <b>the</b> kidnappers to release him.

5|$|A {{series of}} air raids were mounted against Bardia in December, {{in the hope}} of <b>persuading</b> <b>the</b> {{garrison}} to withdraw. Once {{it became clear that the}} Italians intended to stand and fight, bombing priorities shifted to the Italian airbases around Tobruk, Derna and Benina. Air raids on Bardia resumed in the lead-up to the ground assault, with 100 bombing sorties flown against Bardia between 31 December 1940 and 2 January 1941, climaxing with a particularly heavy raid by Vickers Wellington bombers of No. 70 Squadron RAF and Bristol Bombay bombers of No. 216 Squadron RAF on the night of 2/3 January 1941. Lysanders of No. 208 Squadron RAF directed the artillery fire. Fighters from No. 33 Squadron RAF, No. 73 Squadron RAF and No. 274 Squadron RAF patrolled between Bardia and Tobruk.|$|E
5|$|After {{conducting}} a criminal investigation, verifying that Germany would honor its military alliance, and <b>persuading</b> <b>the</b> skeptical Hungarian Count Tisza, Austria-Hungary issued a formal {{letter to the}} government of Serbia. The letter reminded Serbia of its commitment to respect the Great Powers' decision regarding Bosnia-Herzegovina, and to maintain good neighborly relations with Austria-Hungary. The letter contained specific demands aimed at preventing the publication of propaganda advocating the violent destruction of Austria-Hungary, removing the people behind this propaganda from the Serbian Military, arresting the people on Serbian soil {{who were involved in the}} assassination plot and preventing the clandestine shipment of arms and explosives from Serbia to Austria-Hungary.|$|E
5|$|Alcibiades, however, did {{not succeed}} in <b>persuading</b> <b>the</b> satrap to ally with the Athenians, and, to hide this fact, demanded (claiming to be {{speaking}} for Tissaphernes) greater and greater concessions of them until they finally refused to comply. Disenchanted with Alcibiades but still determined to overthrow the democracy, Peisander and his companions returned to Samos, where the conspirators worked to secure their control over the army and encouraged a group of native Samian oligarchs to begin planning the overthrow of their own city's democracy. In Athens, meanwhile, a party of young oligarchic revolutionaries succeeded in gaining de facto control of the government through assassination and intimidation.|$|E

5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century common {{concepts}} of what should be protected in national parks invariably included formidable geologic features like mountains, geysers, or canyons. As Florida's population began to grow significantly and urban areas near the Everglades were developed, proponents of the park's establishment faced difficulty in <b>persuading</b> <b>the</b> federal government and the people of Florida that the subtle and constantly shifting ecosystems in the Everglades were just as worthy of protection. When the park was established in 1947, it became the first area within the U.S. to protect flora and fauna native to a region as opposed to geologic scenery. The National Park Service recognizes nine distinct interdependent ecosystems within the park that constantly shift in size owing to the amount of water present and other environmental factors.|$|E
5|$|At this conference, {{which was}} {{organised}} by Britain with American support, Van der Byl {{rejected the idea}} of an interim British presence in Rhodesia during a transition to majority rule, which was identified {{as one of the few}} ways of <b>persuading</b> <b>the</b> Patriotic Front to endorse a settlement. The conference was adjourned by the British foreign minister, Anthony Crosland, on 14 December 1976, and ultimately never reconvened. The nationalist leaders said they would not return to Geneva or take part in any further talks unless immediate black rule were made the only topic for discussion. Soon after, on 7 January 1977, Van der Byl announced the Rhodesian government's rejection of every proposal made in Geneva.|$|E
5|$|Besides his {{collected}} music criticism, Shaw {{has left}} a varied musical legacy, {{not all of it}} of his choosing. Despite his dislike of having his work adapted for the musical theatre ("my plays set themselves to a verbal music of their own") two of his plays were turned into musical comedies: Arms and the Man was the basis of The Chocolate Soldier in 1908, with music by Oscar Straus, and Pygmalion was adapted in 1956 as My Fair Lady with book and lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner and music by Frederick Loewe. Although he had a high regard for Elgar, Shaw turned down the composer's request for an opera libretto, but played a major part in <b>persuading</b> <b>the</b> BBC to commission Elgar's Third Symphony, and was the dedicatee of The Severn Suite (1930).|$|E

5|$|In 1695, the Parliament of Scotland {{granted a}} charter to the Company of Scotland, which {{established}} {{a settlement in}} 1698 on the Isthmus of Panama. Besieged by neighbouring Spanish colonists of New Granada, and afflicted by malaria, the colony was abandoned two years later. The Darien scheme was a financial disaster for Scotland — a quarter of Scottish capital {{was lost in the}} enterprise — and ended Scottish hopes of establishing its own overseas empire. The episode also had major political consequences, <b>persuading</b> <b>the</b> governments of both England and Scotland of the merits of a union of countries, rather than just crowns. This occurred in 1707 with the Treaty of Union, establishing the Kingdom of Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|In the finale, {{the main}} {{characters}} spend the longest {{amount of time in}} the parallel universe to date. The writers sought to emphasize {{the differences between the two}} worlds: Anna Torv created a unique personality and physical demeanor for her character's doppelgänger, Fauxlivia; DC Comics designed special covers based upon some of their classic editions to display in the Other Side. These and other popular culture differences were noted and appreciated by critics, <b>persuading</b> <b>the</b> writers to add more in the third season. The episodes mark the first appearance of recurring character Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel), as well as the return of actors Leonard Nimoy and Kirk Acevedo as William Bell and Agent Charlie Francis, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Saruman {{makes his}} final {{appearance}} {{at the end of}} the last volume, The Return of the King (1955), after Sauron's defeat. After <b>persuading</b> <b>the</b> Ents to release him from Orthanc, he travels north on foot, apparently reduced to begging. He is accompanied by Wormtongue, whom he beats and curses. When they reach the Shire, Saruman's agents—both Hobbits and Men—have already taken it over and started a destructive process of industrialization. Saruman governs the Shire in secret under the name of Sharkey until the events of chapter 8 ("The Scouring of the Shire") in which Frodo and his companions return and lead a rebellion, defeating the intruders and exposing Saruman's role. Even after Saruman attempts to stab Frodo, Frodo lets him go. When Saruman blames Wormtongue for the damage done to the Shire and curses him, Wormtongue finally snaps and slits his master's throat.|$|E
