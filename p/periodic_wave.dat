25|$|Near {{the end of}} the 20th century, it {{was shown}} that for finite-amplitude waves the {{convergence}} of the Stokes expansion depends strongly on the formulation of the <b>periodic</b> <b>wave</b> problem. For instance, an inverse formulation of the <b>periodic</b> <b>wave</b> problem as used by Stokes – with the spatial coordinates as a function of velocity potential and stream function – does not converge for high-amplitude waves. While other formulations converge much more rapidly, e.g. in the Eulerian frame of reference (with the velocity potential or stream function {{as a function of the}} spatial coordinates).|$|E
