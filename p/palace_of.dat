5|$|Both Buddhism and the Lingbao School {{share the}} idea of the Five Paths of Rebirth (Gati). People were reborn into earth prisons, as a hungry ghost, as an animal, as a man, or as a {{celestial}} being. After death, the body would be alchemically refined in the <b>Palace</b> <b>of</b> Supreme Darkness located in the north, and the Southern Palace in the south. The transmutation of the body consisted of two steps; the yin components of the person were refined in the <b>Palace</b> <b>of</b> Supreme Darkness, followed by the yang components in the Southern Palace. The Lingbao concept of rebirth is a Chinese adaptation of Buddhism, mixing traditional Chinese concepts with newly arrived Buddhist ideas.|$|E
