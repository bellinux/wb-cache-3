5|$|American {{astronomer}} Edwin Hubble categorized M87 {{as one of}} {{the brighter}} globular nebulae, as it lacked any spiral structure, but appeared to belong to the same family of non-galactic nebulae as spiral nebulae. In 1926 he produced a new categorization of nebulae, with M87 being classified as a type of elliptical extra-galactic nebula with no apparent elongation (class E0). By 1931, Hubble had identified M87 {{as a member of the}} Virgo Cluster, for which he gave a <b>provisional</b> <b>estimate</b> of 1.8 million parsecs from Earth.

60|$|The {{journey from}} Liverpool to London, {{like all other}} English journeys, is short. This {{is due to the}} fact that England is a small country: it {{contains}} only 50,000 square miles, whereas the United States, as every one knows, contains three and a half billion. I mentioned this fact to an English fellow passenger on the train, together with a <b>provisional</b> <b>estimate</b> of the American corn crop for 1922: but he only drew his rug about his knees, took a sip of brandy from his travelling flask, and sank into a state resembling death. I contented myself with jotting down an impression of incivility and paid no further attention to my fellow traveller other than to read the labels on his lug gage and to peruse the headings of his newspaper by peeping over his shoulder.|$|E
60|$|If {{the reader}} will refer to Plate 14, {{in which there are}} eight much {{enlarged}} photographs of portions of different finger prints, he will observe that the length of each of the portions exceeds the breadth in the proportion of 3 to 2. Consequently, by drawing one line down the middle and two lines across, each portion may be divided into six squares. Moreover, it will be noticed that the side of each of these squares has a length of about six ridge-intervals. I cut out squares of paper of this size, and throwing one of them at random on any one of the eight portions, succeeded almost as frequently as not in drawing lines on its back which comparison afterwards showed to have followed the true course of the ridges. The <b>provisional</b> <b>estimate</b> that a length of six ridge-intervals approximated to but exceeded that of the side of the desired square, proved to be correct by the following more exact observations, and by three different methods.|$|E

40|$|Struckmeyer, and Joyce Zickler for helpful comments. The views {{expressed}} here are our own Initial estimates of aggregate output and its components {{are based on}} very incomplete source data, so they may not fully capture shifts in economic conditions. In particular, if those estimates are based partly on trends in preceding quarters, {{one would expect to}} see <b>provisional</b> <b>estimates</b> overstating activity when actual output is decelerating and understating it when actual output is accelerating. We examine this issue using the Real Time Data Set for Macroeconomists, which contains contemporaneous estimates of output and its components beginning in the late 1960 s, as well as financial-market information and other data. Our results indicate that <b>provisional</b> <b>estimates</b> do not fully capture accelerations and decelerations, suggesting some tendency for <b>provisional</b> <b>estimates</b> to miss economic turning points. We also consider the related question of whether better use of contemporaneous data could improve the quality of <b>provisional</b> <b>estimates.</b> We find that <b>provisional</b> <b>estimates</b> do not represent optimal forecasts of the current estimates, but that the improvement in forecast quality from including additional data appears to be quite small...|$|R

We use an analytically continued partition function |Z(β +it) |^ 2 as well as correlation functions as diagnostics. Using numerical techniques we establish random matrix behavior at late times. We determine the early time behavior exactly in a double scaling limit, giving us a plausible estimate for the crossover time to random matrix behavior.
