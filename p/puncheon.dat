5|$|The <b>Puncheon</b> Run Connector is an {{unnumbered}} four-lane freeway in Dover, Delaware. It {{is named}} after <b>Puncheon</b> Run, a stream it follows. It provides a connection between U.S. Route 13 (US 13) and the northbound direction of the Delaware Route 1 (DE 1) toll road, with an intermediate interchange at Bay Road. The road {{is part of the}} National Highway System and serves as part of a north-south route for traffic crossing the Delmarva Peninsula. Planning for the <b>Puncheon</b> Run Connector began in the 1980s and originally included a freeway upgrade for US 13 south to Woodside. The connector was scaled back to its current routing in 1992. The freeway was built between 1998 and 2000 at a cost of $25 million.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Puncheon</b> Run Connector {{begins at}} an {{at-grade}} intersection with US 13 in Dover, {{heading to the}} northeast as a four-lane freeway. After passing over State Street, the freeway curves {{to the east and}} passes between woods to the south and residential and commercial development to the north. The road crosses over the marshy St. Jones River and continues east-northeast, passing between a residential neighborhood to the south and the Delaware Department of Transportation (DelDOT) headquarters to the north before coming to an eastbound exit and westbound entrance at Bay Road. Immediately after the Bay Road interchange, the <b>Puncheon</b> Run Connector merges into northbound DE 1 a short distance to the north of Dover Air Force Base.|$|E

5|$|US113Alternate {{continued}} north across Isaac Branch at Moores Lake {{and entered}} the city of Dover just south of its underpass of <b>Puncheon</b> Run Connector and crossing of <b>Puncheon</b> Run. Just north of the stream and highway, the alternate route intersected US13 (DuPont Highway). While South State Street continued north toward the Dover Green Historic District and the Delaware State Capitol, US113Alternate turned east to run concurrently with US13. The two highways crossed the St. Jones River and intersected Court Street (named Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard since 2013), which headed west toward the state capitol and east {{to provide access to}} US 113 (Bay Road). Immediately to the north of Court Street, US113Alternate and US113 reached their joint termini at US 13's directional intersection with Bay Road; US 13 continued north along DuPont Highway. There was no direct access between US 113 Alt. and US 113 at the terminal intersection.|$|E
5|$|The final {{piece of}} the Relief Route {{associated}} with US 113 was the <b>Puncheon</b> Run Connector, which would provide a direct connection between US 13 and DE 1 and US 113. The connector and its partial interchange with US 113 were built between 1998 and 2000. In 2003, the same year the last portion of the Relief Route was completed, DelDOT requested US 113 be eliminated from Milford to Dover {{in favor of the}} sole designation of DE 1 from Milford to Dover. AASHTO denied DelDOT's application at their spring 2003 meeting because the state did not address the status of US 113 Alternate. The organization approved DelDOT's application to also eliminate US 113 Alternate in addition to the MilfordDover portion of US 113 at their annual meeting later in 2003. Bay Road became an unnumbered highway between Exit 95 at Dover Air Force Base and the old northern terminus of US113 at US13 in Dover.|$|E
5|$|Until 2003, US 113 {{continued}} {{north from}} Milford concurrently with DE 1 along four-lane divided Bay Road to Dover. The U.S. Highway crossed the Murderkill River while passing {{to the east}} of Frederica. At the north end of Frederica, the highway met the eastern end of DE 12 (Frederica Road). US 113 passed by historic Barratt's Chapel, the birthplace of Methodism in the United States. The highway met the southern end of US 113 Alternate (Clapham Road) at a Y intersection in the village of Little Heaven. US 113 crossed the St. Jones River and curved northwest at its intersections with the southern end of DE 9 (Bayside Drive) and the western end of Kitts Hummock Road. The highway became a freeway along the edge of Dover Air Force Base. US 113 had a diamond interchange with Old Lebanon Road, which served the main gate of the air force base to the northeast and base housing to the southwest. At the next interchange, a partial cloverleaf interchange with the eastern end of DE 10 (Lebanon Road) next to the military base's north gate, US 113 exited onto Bay Road while DE 1 continued on the Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway. The U.S. Highway had ramps from northbound US 113 to northbound DE 1, from southbound US 113 to southbound DE 1, and from southbound DE 1 to US 113 just south of its partial interchange with the <b>Puncheon</b> Run Connector, which connected DE 1 and US 113 with US 13 {{on the south side of}} Dover. US 113 entered the city of Dover and passed between the DelDOT headquarters and the Blue Hen Corporate Center, which was transformed into a corporate center from the defunct Blue Hen Mall in 1995. The route intersected Court Street (named Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard since 2013), which headed west into the Dover Green Historic District and by the Delaware State Capitol, before reaching its northern terminus at a Y intersection with US 13 and the northern end of US 113 Alternate (DuPont Highway).|$|E

25|$|On Sunday 25 November Southampton hosted Newcastle United in a match {{which saw}} the first return of former Saints manager Alan Pardew since his {{dismissal}} in August 2010. After {{half an hour of}} chances either way, including a Rickie Lambert free kick which hit the crossbar and a strong Jason <b>Puncheon</b> chance, the hosts went ahead in the 35th minute when captain Adam Lallana took advantage of a mistake by Newcastle goalkeeper Tim Krul to put Southampton 1–0 up. After the break the visitors increased their attacking presence, but it was Southampton who scored next when Gastón Ramírez took advantage of another mistake by Krul from a Jason <b>Puncheon</b> cross to put the home side 2–0 up in the 60th minute. The Southampton side were frustrated by a number of decisions by the officials in the match, with Ramírez being denied two penalties following his goal. <b>Puncheon</b> also hit the post again, and José Fonte missed out on his third goal of the season thanks to the crossbar. Jay Rodriguez scored late in the game, but was offside when the ball was played to him, and 2–0 it remained for the Saints to pick up their third win of the season, including their first clean sheet, {{to move out of the}} relegation zone for the first time in over a month.|$|E

25|$|Southampton {{returned}} to St Mary's {{the following week}} to face Reading, who sat just three points behind 18th-placed Southampton in 19th position in the table. The game started relatively evenly {{with a number of}} chances for each side, with the home side's best chance coming after half an hour when Jason <b>Puncheon</b> turned in a corner to score a goal then disallowed for pushing in the penalty area. Just before half time team captain Adam Lallana received an injury, and was replaced by Gastón Ramírez who had not started the match. After the break the Saints continued to pressure the visitors, and in the 61st minute Jason <b>Puncheon</b> finally broke the deadlock to put Southampton one up. More chances went the way of the Saints, including late chances for Guly do Prado and Jack Cork, and ultimately the side held on to pick up the three points and move out of the relegation zone once again.|$|E
25|$|Back at St Mary's the {{following}} week, the Saints hosted current champions Manchester City in the return {{game of the}} opening match of the season. The game began relatively quickly, and within seven minutes the hosts had scored as Jason <b>Puncheon</b> took advantage of a mistake by Gareth Barry to cross in for Jay Rodriguez; the effort was saved, but <b>Puncheon</b> followed it up {{from the edge of}} the area to put Southampton 1–0 up. The home side continued the pressure on the visitors, and in the 22nd minute Steven Davis made it two when Joe Hart failed to catch a shot from Rickie Lambert with the midfielder running into the box for the tap-in. Rodriguez almost scored a third for Southampton, volleying narrowly wide, but City replied before the break with a counter-attack goal from Edin Džeko set up by Pablo Zabaleta. The half ended with a strong penalty call for Southampton, and after the break the Saints continued to play for a third goal; it came quickly, as Barry's bad fortunes continued when he turned Lambert's cross into his own net despite very little pressure on the ball to make it 3–1 to the 16th-placed side. Despite a change in personnel and tactics, City were unable to get back into the game in a meaningful way, giving Southampton their first win since 12 January to move up to 15th.|$|E

Billy Sharp, who provided the assist for the first goal, got on the scoresheet himself 20 minutes later with Southampton's second, before winger Jason <b>Puncheon</b> scored a third two minutes later from outside the penalty area. Among a number of young players coming on as substitutes late in the game, Ben Reeves scored on his season debut in the third minute of injury time to seal the win for the Saints, with the home side picking up a consolation goal to leave the score at 4–1.|$|E
25|$|On 5 January 2013, Southampton hosted FA Cup holders Chelsea in the Third Round of the tournament.

Shortly after the break the hosts conceded again when Branislav Ivanović headed in a Juan Mata cross, and Ba made it 4–1 for the reigning champions on the hour mark. In the last ten minutes Chelsea were awarded a penalty for a handball by Steven Davis, and substitute captain Frank Lampard converted confidently to seal a 5–1 win at St Mary's, knocking Southampton out of the competition.|$|E

25|$|On 23 November 2013, Pulis was {{appointed}} manager of Crystal Palace on a two-and-half-year contract, taking over from Ian Holloway.

He signed Tom Ince on loan from Blackpool, while permanently signing Joe Ledley from Celtic, Scott Dann from Blackburn Rovers, Jason <b>Puncheon</b> from Southampton and Wayne Hennessey from Wolverhampton Wanderers. The new arrivals helped Palace to become a more solid team defensively and they went on a run of five consecutive victories, which included wins over Chelsea, Cardiff City, Aston Villa, Everton and West Ham. This run of form earned Palace mathematical safety and saw Pulis named as Manager of the Month for April 2014. Palace finished the 2013–14 Premier League season in 11th position with 45 points, which saw Pulis named as the Premier League Manager of the Year.|$|E
25|$|With {{the club}} in 11th place in the league table, Southampton hosted West Ham United just a {{position}} below them on equal points on 13 April. The game was a largely scrappy affair in difficult weather conditions, and both the home side and the away side enjoyed early chances – a shot by Rickie Lambert from a corner was deflected onto the post by United goalkeeper Jussi Jääskeläinen, and winger Ricardo Vaz Tê was denied by the crossbar. Just before the hour mark, however, the Saints finally broke the deadlock when Gastón Ramírez found himself free of the West Ham defence and, on the second attempt, slotted {{the ball into the}} visitors' net. The lead was sacrificed just seven minutes later, as a Jos Hooiveld-conceded free kick was scored scrappily by Andy Carroll to put the Hammers in with a chance of points. Jay Rodriguez and Jason <b>Puncheon</b> were introduced later in the match, which helped the home side, but it was not enough to overcome a resilient West Ham side and obtain all three points.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} week Southampton travelled to Loftus Road to face Queens Park Rangers, {{the only team}} lower in the table than the Saints. The game started well for the visitors, who dominated possession {{for the first half}} and enjoyed the majority of the goal-scoring opportunities and attacking play. The positive start led to a goal for Rickie Lambert in the 23rd minute, putting Southampton 1–0 up and on the way to only their second win of the season. Just before the half time break, Jason <b>Puncheon</b> made it 2–0 for the Saints with a solo strike beating QPR goalkeeper Júlio César. Early into the second half however, Southampton conceded a goal when Canadian winger Junior Hoilett took advantage of individual mistakes to bring the home side back into the game. The remainder of the second half was relatively even, with both sides having a number of chances to score, but it was Southampton who eventually scored another when Morgan Schneiderlin took a shot in the 83rd minute which was deflected in by defender Anton Ferdinand.|$|E
