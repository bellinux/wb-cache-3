5|$|Niobium, {{formerly}} columbium, is {{a chemical}} element with symbol Nb (formerly Cb) and atomic number 41. It is a soft, grey, ductile transition metal, {{often found in}} the minerals <b>pyrochlore</b> (the main commercial source for niobium) and columbite. Its name comes from Greek mythology, specifically Niobe, who {{was the daughter of}} Tantalus, the namesake of tantalum. The name reflects the great similarity between the two elements in their physical and chemical properties, making them difficult to distinguish.|$|E
5|$|The three largest {{currently}} mined {{deposits of}} <b>pyrochlore,</b> two in Brazil {{and one in}} Canada, {{were found in the}} 1950s, and are still the major producers of niobium mineral concentrates. The largest deposit is hosted within a carbonatite intrusion in Araxá, state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, owned by CBMM (Companhia Brasileira de Metalurgia e Mineração); the other active Brazilian deposit is located near Catalão, state of Goiás, and owned by China Molybdenum, also hosted within a carbonatite intrusion. Together, those two mines produce about 88% of the world's supply. Brazil also has a large but still unexploited deposit near São Gabriel da Cachoeira, state of Amazonas, as well as a few smaller deposits, notably in the state of Roraima.|$|E
25|$|The Australian Synroc (synthetic rock) {{is a more}} {{sophisticated}} way to immobilize such waste, and this process may eventually come into commercial use for civil wastes (it is currently being developed for US military wastes). Synroc was invented by Prof Ted Ringwood (a geochemist) at the Australian National University. The Synroc contains <b>pyrochlore</b> and cryptomelane type minerals. The original form of Synroc (Synroc C) was designed for the liquid high level waste (PUREX raffinate) from a light water reactor. The main minerals in this Synroc are hollandite (BaAl2Ti6O16), zirconolite (CaZrTi2O7) and perovskite (CaTiO3). The zirconolite and perovskite are hosts for the actinides. The strontium and barium will be fixed in the perovskite. The caesium will be fixed in the hollandite.|$|E
40|$|The final {{publication}} {{is available}} at Springer via [URL] formation energy of cation antisites in <b>pyrochlores</b> (A 2 B 2 O 7) has been correlated with the susceptibility to amorphize under irradiation, and thus, density functional theory calculations of antisite energetics can provide insights into the radiation tolerance of <b>pyrochlores.</b> Here, we show that {{the formation energy of}} antisite pairs in titanate <b>pyrochlores,</b> as opposed to other families of <b>pyrochlores</b> (B = Zr, Hf, or Sn), exhibits a strong dependence on the separation distance between the antisites. Classical molecular dynamics simulations of collision cascades in Er 2 Ti 2 O 7 show that the average separation of antisite pairs {{is a function of the}} primary knock-on atom energy that creates the collision cascades. Together, these results suggest that the radiation tolerance of titanate <b>pyrochlores</b> may be sensitive to the irradiation conditions and might be controllable via the appropriate selection of ion beam parameters...|$|R

X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy show a transformation from the ordered <b>pyrochlores</b> (Fd 3 m) to the anion deficient fluorite (Fm 3 m) structure in Gd 2 Zr 2 O 7 or amorphization in Nd 2 Zr 2 O 7. The track diameter, crystallite size and progression in structural modifications have been monitored. It is found that radiation stability of these <b>pyrochlores</b> depends on the energy to form cation antisites and delocalized anion vacancies.

500|$|Niobium is {{estimated}} to be the 34th most common element in the Earth’s crust, with 20ppm. Some think that the abundance on Earth is much greater, and that the element's high density has concentrated it in the Earth’s core. The free element is not found in nature, but niobium occurs in combination with other elements in minerals. Minerals that contain niobium often also contain tantalum. [...] Examples include columbite ((Fe,Mn)(Nb,Ta)2O6) and columbite–tantalite (or coltan, (Fe,Mn)(Ta,Nb)2O6). Columbite–tantalite minerals are most usually found as accessory minerals in pegmatite intrusions, and in alkaline intrusive rocks. Less common are the niobates of calcium, uranium, thorium and the rare earth elements. [...] Examples of such niobates are <b>pyrochlore</b> ((Na,Ca)2Nb2O6(OH,F)) and euxenite ((Y,Ca,Ce,U,Th)(Nb,Ta,Ti)2O6). These large deposits of niobium have been found associated with carbonatites (carbonate-silicate igneous rocks) and as a constituent of <b>pyrochlore.</b>|$|E

The evolution of the oxygen sub-lattice identifies specific features (extra 17 O NMR signals and Raman bands) which undoubtedly reveal local oxygen order and disorder in these stoichiometric long range ordered crystalline <b>pyrochlores.</b> These results complete the understanding of the atomic scale in these stoichiometric <b>pyrochlores</b> necessitating the need for new microscopic structural models.

40|$|The {{response}} of titanate <b>pyrochlores</b> (A 2 Ti 2 O 7, A = Y, Gd and Sm) to electronic excitation is investigated utilizing an ab initio molecular dynamics method. All the titanate <b>pyrochlores</b> {{are found to}} undergo a crystalline-to-amorphous structural transition under a low concentration of electronic excitations. The transition temperature at which structural amorphization starts to occur depends on the concentration of electronic excitations. During the structural transition, O 2 -like molecules are formed, and this anion disorder further drives cation disorder that leads to an amorphous state.

However the structural origin underlying their low thermal conductivities remain unclear. In the present study, we investigated the phonon properties of {{two groups of}} RE <b>pyrochlores,</b> Ln 2 Zr 2 O 7 (Ln = La, Nd, Sm, Gd) and Gd 2 T 2 O 7 (T = Zr, Hf, Sn, Pb) employing density functional theory and quasi harmonic approximation. Through the relaxation time approximation (RTA) with Debye model, the thermal conductivities of those RE <b>pyrochlores</b> were predicted, showing good agreement with experimental measurements. The low thermal conductivities of RE <b>pyrochlores</b> were shown to largely come from the interference between the low-lying optical branches and acoustic branches.

30|$|The most {{preferred}} metal for the DRM {{reaction is}} Ni {{due to its}} low cost and availability [8, 10, 17, 18, 19]; however, this metal undergoes severe deactivation due to carbon deposition. Noble metals like Ru, Rh, and Pt have greater resistance to carbon deposition, but are not economical [4, 7, 9, 21, 22]. In our previous work, we have studied Ru (on B-site) and Sr (on A-site) substituted <b>pyrochlores</b> for DRM [12]. In the present work, we report a study of Ru and Pt substituted (at the B-site) lanthanum zirconate <b>pyrochlores.</b> Despite their well-known thermal stability and reports of their use for other purposes such as thermal barrier coatings, {{we are aware of}} only one study of these materials for DRM, i.e., by Ashcroft et.al [1]. In that paper, Ashcroft et al. studied Eu 2 Ir 2 O 7 <b>pyrochlores</b> and observed that above 342  °C under DRM conditions, these materials completely decompose to Eu 2 O 3 and Ir metal.

30|$|The TPO of the LRuZ <b>pyrochlores</b> after CH 4 TPR {{suggests}} that the carbon formed was qualitatively different from that observed over LZ and LPtZ <b>pyrochlores.</b> The peak at 516  °C {{could be due to}} the oxidation of the same dehydrogenated polymeric carbon found on the LPtZ deposited away from the active metal [16, 23]. A high temperature peak was observed at 776  °C, which was not observed over LZ or LPtZ. This carbon could be graphitic in nature and is extremely stable, requiring a high temperature for oxidation. In one of our earlier studies with Ru and Sr substituted <b>pyrochlores,</b> we observed similar graphitic carbon oxidizing at 790  °C [12].

On top of this, {{the positions of the}} Weyl points in reciprocal space can be tuned widely by an external magnetic field: rotated within the surface plane, the Weyl points and magnon arcs are rotated as well; tilting the magnetic field out-of-plane shifts the Weyl points toward the center Γ̅ of the surface Brillouin zone.
