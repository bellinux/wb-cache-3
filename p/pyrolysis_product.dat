25|$|Acrolein is a <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>product</b> that is {{abundant}} in cigarette smoke. It gives smoke an acrid smell and an irritating, lachrymatory effect {{and is a}} major contributor to its carcinogenicity. Like PAH metabolites, acrolein is also an electrophilic alkylating agent and permanently binds to the DNA base guanine, by a conjugate addition followed by cyclization into a hemiaminal. The acrolein-guanine adduct induces mutations during DNA copying and thus causes cancers {{in a manner similar to}} PAHs. However, acrolein is 1000 times more abundant than PAHs in cigarette smoke and is able to react as is, without metabolic activation. Acrolein has been shown to be a mutagen and carcinogen in human cells. The carcinogenicity of acrolein has been difficult to study by animal experimentation, because it has such a toxicity that it tends to kill the animals before they develop cancer. Generally, compounds able to react by conjugate addition as electrophiles (so-called Michael acceptors after Michael reaction) are toxic and carcinogenic, because they can permanently alkylate DNA, similarly to mustard gas or aflatoxin. Acrolein is only one of them present in cigarette smoke; for example, crotonaldehyde has been found in cigarette smoke. Michael acceptors also contribute to the chronic inflammation present in tobacco disease.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} the delta(13) C values of <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>products</b> from cellulose and lignin, {{the main components}} of wood, to prove that in the pyrolysis process no isotope exchange between different <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>products</b> appears and that hence <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>products</b> represent the isotope content of their precursors. Two cellulose samples and a lignin sample with delta(13) C values of - 23, - 12 and - 28 parts per thousand, respectively, were pyrolysed using Curie point pyrolysis simultaneously coupled to GC/MS and GC/IRMS. All samples were pyrolysed individually and in mixtures of lignin with both isotopically different celluloses in two mixing ratios, e. g. 1 : 1 and 4 : 1; the latter is representative for wood. No intermolecular isotope exchange between <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>products</b> from cellulose and lignin was observed. This proves that Curie point pyrolysis is suitable for investigating the isotope content of <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>products</b> in complex mixtures like wood. <b>Pyrolysis</b> <b>products</b> from both celluloses and lignin have delta(13) C values similar to the bulk delta(13) C value of the respective sample. In mixtures of cellulose and lignin delta(13) C values of some <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>products</b> change slightly due to peak overlap and higher background signals. However, detected changes were independent from the isotopic difference between the mixing partners. <b>Pyrolysis</b> <b>products</b> such as 2, 6 -dimethoxyphenol, 4 -methyl- 2, 6 -dimethoxyphenol and trans- 4 -(2 -propenyl) - 2, 6 -dimethoxyphenol for lignin and 2 -hydroxymethyl- 5 -hydroxy- 2, 3 -dihydro-(4 H) -pyrane- 4 -one and levoglucosane for cellulose were found to represent the isotopic signature from cellulose and lignin in mixtures regardless of the composition of the mixture.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of enzymatic/mild acidolysis lignin (EMAL) isolated from moso bamboo were investigated using pyrolysis-gas chromato-graphy/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS).

Pyrolysis temperature had a distinct impact on yields of <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>products.</b> As <b>pyrolysis</b> temperature increased, the yield of 2, 3 -dihydrobenzofuran rapidly decreased; however, yields of phenols increased smoothly.

50|$|Methylecgonidine is a <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>product</b> {{formed when}} crack cocaine is smoked, making this {{substance}} a useful biomarker to specifically test {{for use of}} crack cocaine, as opposed to powder cocaine which does not form methylecgonidine as a metabolite. Methylecgonidine has a relatively short half-life of 18-21 minutes, after which it is metabolised to ecgonidine, meaning that the relative concentrations of the two compounds {{can be used to}} estimate how recently crack cocaine has been smoked. Methylecgonidine {{has been shown to be}} specifically more harmful to the body than other byproducts of cocaine; for example to the heart, lungs & liver. The toxicity is due to a partial agonist effect at M1 and M3 muscarinic receptors, leading to DNA fragmentation and neuronal death by apoptosis.|$|E

The analysed soils were cultivated, either continuously with a C 3 plant (wheat delta(13) C-value = - 25. 2 parts per thousand), or transferred to a C 4 plant (maize delta(13) C-value = - 11. 4 parts per thousand) cropping 23 years ago. Most <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>products</b> identified were related to carbohydrates (furans), lipids (hydrocarbons and derivatives of benzene), proteins (nitriles and pyrrole) and lignins (phenols), The relative yield of all individual <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>products</b> was similar in the samples from the maize and control wheat soil. The isotopic enrichment between identical <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>products</b> from the two soils varied from 1 to 12 delta (delta) units, indicating that after 23 years of cultivation 7 to 90 % of their C was derived from maize. This suggests a slow mean turnover time varying from 9 to 220 years. Based on the differences in isotopic enrichment of chemical structures after vegetation change the <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>products</b> could be divided into three groups: (i) <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>products</b> with a nearly complete C 4 signal, e. g. phenol, derived from lignin degradation <b>products,</b> (ii) <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>products</b> with an intermediate isotopic enrichment of 6 - 8 parts per thousand, most likely to be a composite of remaining (possibly physically protected) fragments derived from both maize and native wheat, and (iii) <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>products</b> showing only low enrichments in C- 13 of 1 - 3 parts per thousand. Most of their precursors were found to be proteinaceaous materials.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of soil organic carbon {{are included in}} global carbon (C) cycle scenarios using different, but generally arbitrary defined, kinetic pools. To improve global C models, better relationships between the chemical structure of soil organic matter (SOM) and its kinetic pools are needed. To assess the molecular residence time of SOM and the relation with plant inputs, pyrolysis-GC/MS-C-IRMS was performed on maize plants and on two samples from the same soil that had undergone a vegetation change from the C 3 plant wheat to the C 4 plant maize. This vegetation change has added naturally C- 13 - enriched material to the soil. Most <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>products</b> from the maize were derived from polysaccharides and lignins, and were not detected in soils. However, polysaccharide-derived products were also major <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>products</b> in soils, N-containing or unspecific <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>products</b> were also detected. The residence times (based on C- 13 natural labelling) revealed a continuum of values, that was independent of chemical structure, with only two <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>products</b> presenting a relatively long residence time (ca. 100 years). An unexpected long life-time for N- containing (similar to 49 years) and polysaccharide-derived (similar to 54 years) <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>products</b> was found.
