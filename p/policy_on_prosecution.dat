40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a comparative}} study of environmental law and policy in India and the UK. The study uses research methodology based on comparative law method, concepts of lesson drawing and policy transfer from political science, and socio-legal approaches. This study concludes that India should take measures to improve enforcement of various environmental laws, including adopting a revised policy on pollution prevention, developing an integrated approach to pollution abatement, developing a <b>policy</b> <b>on</b> <b>prosecution</b> and enforcement, restructuring various environmental laws to meet treaty obligations, introducing incentive based instruments for pollution abatement and adopting a cooperative approach to enforcement of the environmental laws. India may positively draw lessons from the UK in these areas. The UK may draw inspiration from the novel environmental jurisprudence developed by the Indian Supreme Court. This study also favours establishment of an environmental court in each jurisdiction. ...|$|E
40|$|The optimal accomplice-witnesses {{regulation}} is characterized {{in a model}} with hi-erarchical criminal organizations and corruption. We identify the determinants of the optimal amnesty rate and show that such a policy sties incentives for crime as well as corruption. We argue that rewarding informants is sometimes necessary to 8 ̆ 5 ght organized crime and show how the optimal amnesty rate varies with the e¤ectiveness of the witnesses-protection program, {{the reliability of the}} informantstestimonies and the degree of trust and cohesion between the members of the organizations. The im-plications of our analysis are tested by exploiting a quasi-experimental panel data set, relative to 95 Italian provinces. The evidence allows to identify the positive e¤ect of the <b>policy</b> <b>on</b> <b>prosecution</b> as well as its deterrence e¤ect on crimes. Moreover, by using data on the number of accomplices we also underscore the positive impact of the policy on corruption prosecution...|$|E

50|$|Proposition 57 was a California ballot proposition, {{approved}} on the November 8, 2016 ballot.

Due to the approval of the proposition, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation will begin to implement these new parole and sentencing provisions.|$|R

Manhattan District Attorney Thomas E. Dewey would successfully get Hines convicted on 13 counts of racketeering. Hines provided protection for the policy racket in Harlem and other sections of New York. Hines was charged with influencing Magistrates Capshaw and Erwin to throw out policy cases in which the other conspirators had an interest and to influence former District Attorney William C. Dodge to 'go easy' <b>on</b> <b>policy</b> <b>prosecutions.</b> Hines was alleged to have received a cut in the proceeds of the policy racket.|$|R
40|$|The {{estimation}} of cartel overcharges {{lies at the}} heart of antitrust <b>policy</b> <b>on</b> cartel <b>prosecution</b> as it constitutes a key element in the determination of fines. Connor and Lande (2008) conducted a survey of cartels and found a mean overcharge estimate in the range of 31 % to 49 %. By examining more sources, Connor (2010) finds a mean of 50. 4 % for successful cartels. However, the data used in those studies are estimates obtained from different methodologies, sources and contexts rather than by direct observations. Therefore, these data are subject to model error, estimation error and publication bias. A quick examination of the Connor database reveals that the universe of overcharge estimate is asymmetric, heterogenous and contains a number of influential observations. Beside the fact that overcharge estimate are potentially biased, fitting a linear regression model to the data without providing a carefull treatment of the problems raised above may produce distorted results. We conduct a meta-analysis of cartel overcharge estimate in the spirit of Connor and Bolotova (2006) while providing a sound treatment of these matters. We find a bias-corrected mean and median overcharge estimate of 15. 76 % and 16. 43 %. Clearly, our results have significant antitrust policy implications...|$|R
50|$|The Liberian TRC {{has faced}} much {{criticism}} {{for a variety}} of reasons. Critics have claimed that the TRC lacked adequate funding, competent staff, and sufficient infrastructure. The government's failure to follow through on the recommendations made by the TRC has reflected poorly on the Liberian Truth Commission's image. In 2008, Amnesty International criticized the TRC's inability to publicize its <b>policies</b> <b>on</b> reparation and <b>prosecution,</b> as well as the commission's <b>policies</b> <b>on</b> protection for victims, lack of general amnesty for those that provide information, and inability to provide individual reparations. The TRC also ran past its indicated period of activity, which caused the final hearings and the report to be rushed to meet the mandated deadline. This hurriedness caused a disconnect between the names recommended for prosecution or to be barred from office and their specific crimes along with a general lack of evidence to support the claims made by the TRC. The Liberian TRC's lack of power has been pointed out and further demonstrated by the Liberian government failing to enact any of their recommendations. Beyond having its recommendations ignored, the list of individuals recommended to be barred from office was found unconstitutional by the Liberian government. This ruling allowed President Sirleaf, who was recommended to be barred from office, to remain in power, garnering much international criticism.|$|R

5000|$|The then Director of Public Prosecutions (the DPP), Sir Theobald Mathew, made {{submission}} to the Bill's Commons Select Committee on 27 May 1957 that his office would [...] "take {{into account the}} existing reputation of the author, the publisher, the printer" [...] before deciding <b>on</b> <b>prosecution.</b> Roy Jenkins wrote to The Spectator on 26 August 1960 that the DPP's decision to indict Penguin was a misapplication of the law.|$|R
50|$|The federal {{kidnapping}} statute doesn't {{specify a}} time limit <b>on</b> <b>prosecutions,</b> so the general limits of 18 U.S.C. §§ 3281 and3282 supply the time limit <b>on</b> <b>prosecution,</b> if there is any. There is no time limit on a capital crime (section 3281), but non-capital crimes are subject to a five-year statute of limitations (section 3282). Seale moved to dismiss the indictment {{on the theory that}} the latter applied to him. Although kidnapping was a capital offense in 1964, Congress detached the death penalty from it in the mid-1970s in response to United States v. Jackson, 390 U.S. 570 (1968), and Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238 (1972). This should be given retroactive effect, Seale contended, making his offense subject to section 3282's five year limit, and the indictment accordingly untimely. The district court rejected this argument. The case proceeded to trial, the jury found Seale guilty on all counts (helped, no doubt, by an FBI agent's testimony that Seale had admitted the crime after his arrest), and three life sentences ensued.|$|R
