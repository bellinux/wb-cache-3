40|$|Abstract:-With {{a surface}} area of 400, 000 km 2, the Triassic Province in Algeria {{represents}} a vast Saharan territory, in which significant hydrocarbon layers are exploited on the Triassic and Cambrian–Ordovician levels. The Saharan Triassic consisted of varied continental environments, namely, fluvial, flood plain, lake, Sebkha, and wind. At the top of Formation I, the lower series of strata of the Triassic, there are intercalations of volcanic rocks represented by dolerites.

In such a context, and during the periods of no deposition, physicochemical phenomena related to the climate and type of bedrock occur, leading to the formation of a more or less advanced ground related to the elapsed time between two phases of sedimentation; this phenomenon is known as <b>paedogenesis.</b> Formation II is characterized by the eruptive on the level of the lower member IIa at the bas...|$|E
40|$|Parallel {{alterations}} in {{the timing of}} ovarian Ecdysone Receptor and Ultraspiracle expression characterize the independent evolution of larval reproduction in two species of gall midges (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) Received: 30 July 1999 / Accepted: 23 Feburary 2000 Abstract Although most insects reproduce in the adult stage, facultative larval or pupal reproduction (<b>paedogenesis)</b> has evolved at least six times indepently in insects, twice in gall midges of the family Cecidomyiidae (Diptera). <b>Paedogenesis</b> in gall midges involves the precocious growth and differentiation of the ovary in an otherwise larval form. We have previously shown that the timing of expression of the Ecdysone Receptor (EcR) and Ultraspiracle (USP), the two proteins that constitute the functional receptor for the steroid hormone 20 -hydroxyecdysone, regulates the timing and progression of ovarian differentiation in Drosophila melanogaster (Diptera: Drosophilidae). Here we test the hypothesis that precocious activation of EcR and USP in the ovaries of paedogenetic gall midges allows for precocious ovarian differentiation. Using monoclonal antibodies directed against insect EcR and USP proteins, we first show that when these gall midges are reared under conditions that promote typical, metamorphic development, upregulation of EcR and USP occurs in the final larval stage. By contrast, in the paedogenetic life cycle, EcR and USP are up-regulated early in the first larval stage. A similar pattern is seen for two independently-evolved paedogenetic gall midges, Heteropeza pygmaea and Mycophila speyeri. We discuss our results {{in the context of}} developmental constraints on the evolution of <b>paedogenesis</b> in dipteran insects...|$|E
40|$|Genetic {{and sexual}} {{systems can be}} {{evolutionarily}} dynamic within and among clades. However, identifying the processes responsible for switches between, for instance, sexual and asexual reproduction, or cyclic and non-cyclic life histories remains challenging. When animals evolve parthenogenetic reproduction, information about the sexual mating system becomes lost. Here we report an extraordinary case where {{we have been able}} to resurrect sexual adults in a species of beetle that reproduces by parthenogenetic <b>paedogenesis,</b> without the production of adults. Via heat treatment, we were able to artificially induce adult beetles of Micromalthus debilis in order to describe its pre-paedogenetic mating system. Adults showed a highly female biased sex ratio, out-breeding behaviour, and sex-role reversal. Paedogenetic larvae of Micromalthus are infected with the endosymbiotic bacteria Rickettsia and Wolbachia. Clear signs of vestigialization in adults are concurrent with the loss of adults. Our data suggest an ancient female sex ratio bias that predated the loss of adults, perhaps associated with endosymbionts. We propose a model for the transition from a haplodiploid cyclical parthenogenetic life history to parthenogenetic <b>paedogenesis.</b> Paedogenetic development induces a new mechanism of sex ratio bias in midges, wasps and beetles...|$|E
40|$|Most organisms {{reproduce}} sexually, but {{the evolution}} of sexual reproduction is not yet well understood. Sexual reproduction leads to new variation and adaptations to the environment, but sex is also costly. Some insects reproduce without sex through parthenogenesis or <b>paedogenesis.</b> Almost all sexual insects have two separate sexes, male and female. There are many mechanisms of sex determination. Most insects have male heterogamety (males XY, females XX). Female heterogamety and haplodiploidy (males haploid, females diploid) are less abundant. Proportions males and females in populations are typically equal, but deviations are known to occur by driving sex chromosomes and other sex ratio distorters. ...|$|E

Experiments revealed that the larvae were reproductively active. Egg production and anticipated mortality rates suggest a self-sustaining population. This is the first account of a ctenophore population entirely recruiting through larval reproduction (<b>paedogenesis).</b> We hypothesize that early reproduction is favoured over growth to compensate for high predation pressure...|$|E

Our observations demonstrated that casting activity was synchronous with plant growth. More casts were also found in the row intercepts compared to the interrow ones. Both the spatial and temporal variations are thought to be caused by the microclimate found under the plant canopy, verifying results from controlled laboratory studies that show casting activity to be controlled by soil temperature and moisture.

Two of these tadpoles show an unusual group of black roundish spots in the abdominal region, and a third similar group of spots is present in another slab but {{we were unable to}} state if it was associated with a tadpole or not. Several hypotheses can be proposed to account for these structures: artefacts; intestinal content (seeds; inert, bacterial or fungal aggregations; eggs); internal or external parasites; diseases; eggs produced by the tadpole. The latter hypothesis is discussed in detail and is shown to be unlikely for several reasons. However, in the improbable case where these spots would correspond to eggs, this would be the first reported case of natural <b>paedogenesis</b> in anurans, a phenomenon which has been so far considered impossible mostly for anatomical reasons (e. g., absence of space in the abdominal cavity) ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe Miradouro da Lua cliffs, {{which are}} 60 km south of Luanda, record the {{building}} and uplift of the late Neogene Palaeo-Cuanza delta. The detailed study of the sedimentary architecture and stacking pattern permitted separation of the pile into five depositional units bounded by erosional surfaces and characterised by separate facies associations (genetic sequences = units in this paper). At {{the base of the}} series, aeolian deposits (Unit 1) mark the development of a possible coastal desert during the late Miocene aridification. The major Pliocene sea-level rise (Transgressive Systems Tract) led to the drowning of the continental platform into a discrete shoreface-foreshore sequence (Unit 2), followed by an expanded deltaic sequence (Unit 3) that represents the main outcrop of the area. The sedimentary fabric of this prograding wedge during the Highstand Systems Tract reveals laterally stacked pluri-hectometic mouth bars built by the abrupt switching of a bird-foot delta during the Pliocene highstand. The clinoforms are deeply incised by submarine gullies filled both by periodic river-driven turbidite and tidal currents (Unit 4) during the coeval growing of the delta. The topset of the prograding wedge and associated gullies infill is truncated by an overall erosional unconformity that marks the widespread development of an extensive braid-delta system (Unit 5) during the lower Pleistocene sea-level drop (Lowstand Systems Tract). The last 6 m of the Braid-delta unit is overprinted by a ferallitic profile, forming the surface of the plateau and indicating long-term subaerial exposure and weathering processes consistent with the maximum warming of the middle to late Pleistocene interglacial periods. The successive abrupt shifts of the depositional systems through the sedimentary pile indicate a high-amplitude sea level amplified by major coastal uplifts and the reorganisation of the fluvial network. In this context, the palaeo-Cuanza prograding wedge signals the westward tilting and 60 m total uplift of the coastal plain during the Pliocene. A new uplift pulse by differential tilt and slope increase is deduced from the widespread development of the braid-delta complex during the early Pleistocene. The last tectonic event corresponds to the 80 - to 100 -m uplift and ferallitic <b>paedogenesis</b> during the middle to late Pleistocene interglacial stages...|$|E
40|$|In the {{viviparous}} gyrodactylids, embryos develop one inside another {{within the}} parental uterus, a phenomenon with major {{implications for the}} biology of this species-rich group. Development occurs via two routes: first-born daughters develop at the centre of an embryo cluster in utero, whereas all other daughters develop from oocytes. The resulting offspring are, however, morphologically indistinguishable. We review here the history of gyrodactylid embryology {{in the context of}} current knowledge and, present additional cytogenetic and ultrastructural observations of embryonic development. These progenetic parasites are highly modified for viviparity; oocyte maturation and sperm storage occur in a single chamber, the Egg Cell Forming Region, and a mature oocyte passes into the uterus after the birth of the preceding, fully developed offspring. The uterus has a syncytial lining derived from anterior and posterior cap cells. These cells are the first to differentiate in the female reproductive system and may be involved in controlling development. Embryos receive nutrients via the uterus rather than from vitelline cells. Traditionally, development of the first-born daughter has been considered a form of polyembryony, although <b>paedogenesis</b> has also been suggested. In contrast to previous studies, we could not trace lineage of the first-born daughter to a single quiescent macromere. However, only mitotic divisions have been conclusively observed in the intraembryonic generation, indicating an asexual origin. All other daughters are formed from meiotically derived oocytes by sexual reproduction or automictic parthenogenesis. The latter may involve pre-meiotic doubling of chromosomes, but the precise mechanism and the relative proportion of sexual and parthenogenetic offspring are unknown. Exceptionally, cleavage in Gyrodactylus spp. occurs by duets rather than quartets (a pattern previously only recorded in acoels) and is characterised by extensive cell rearrangements. Blastomeres may be connected by fine cytoplasmic processes or completely disassociated and are readily redistributed by the muscular actions of the parental uterus. This process resembles ‘Blastomeren-Anarchie’ of rhabdocoels but without the structural support of vitelline cells. It prevents generation of early cell fate maps and indicates regulative, rather than mosaic, development. Structures such as the gut and excretory system differentiate late, and are highlighted, together with the attachment apparatus, as examples of post-embryonic differentiation. Molecular and cellular techniques are now essential to further elucidate mechanisms of gyrodactylid reproduction, which will in turn contribute to current debates with animal embryology...|$|E
