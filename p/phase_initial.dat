50|$|<b>Initial</b> <b>phase</b> {{females and}} <b>initial</b> <b>phase</b> males both can change into {{terminal}} phase males. However, {{this change in}} sex is permanent: once an <b>initial</b> <b>phase</b> female or male changes into a terminal phase male, it cannot change back. An experiment removing terminal phase males from a population showed that more females changed into terminal phase males, and even aggression levels increased and coloration changes occurred to signify the female's change to terminal <b>phase</b> male. The <b>initial</b> <b>phase</b> males have comparatively larger testes than the larger, terminal phase males. This enables the <b>initial</b> <b>phase</b> males to produce more sperm for the snatched opportunities they must take when trying to fertilize the eggs of the females in the guarded harem. <b>Initial</b> <b>phase</b> (IP) males also achieve fertilizations through participating in group spawns. These groups consist of 20-50 or more IP males that congregate at specific sites during the daily spawning period on medium and larger sized reefs. Females visit these groups to spawn and release eggs in a 'spawning rush'. IP males attempt to position themselves next to a female when she releases her eggs, as this maximizes their probability of fertilizing these eggs. Releasing large numbers of sperm also increases this probability and this is thought to also help explain the large testis size observed in IP males. This type of mating competition {{is referred to as}} 'sperm competition' and is seen in many species.|$|R

40|$|We {{measure the}} {{three-dimensional}} topology of large-scale {{structure in the}} Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). This allows the genus statistic to be measured with unprecedented statistical accuracy. The sample size is now sufficiently large to allow the topology {{to be an important}} tool for testing galaxy formation models. For comparison, we make mock SDSS samples using several state-of-the-art N-body simulations: the Millennium run of Springel et al. (2005) (10 billion particles), Kim & Park (2006) CDM models (1. 1 billion particles), and Cen & Ostriker (2006) hydrodynamic code models (8. 6 billion cell hydro mesh). Each of these simulations uses a different method for modeling galaxy formation. The SDSS data show a genus curve that is broadly characteristic of that produced by Gaussian random <b>phase</b> <b>initial</b> conditions. Thus the data strongly support the standard model of inflation where Gaussian random <b>phase</b> <b>initial</b> conditions are produced by random quantum fluctuations in the early universe. But on top of this general shape there are measurable differences produced by non-linear gravitational effects (cf. Matsubara 1994), and biasing connected with galaxy formation. The N-body simulations have been tuned to reproduce the power spectrum and multiplicity function but not topology, so topology is an acid test for these models. The data show a "meatball" shift (only partly due to the Sloan Great Wall of Galaxies; this shift also appears in a sub-sample not containing the Wall) which differs at the 2. 5 σ level from the results of the Millennium run and the Kim & Park dark halo models, even including the effects of cosmic variance.
