40|$|A {{low-cost}} paper-based {{microfluidic device}} (PAD) for the multiplex electrochemical determination of glucose, uric acid, and dopamine in biological fluids was developed. Using wax <b>printing,</b> <b>PAD</b> containing a central zone, six channels, and six detection zones was fabricated, and the electrodes were printed on detection zones using pre-made electrodes template. For each analyte, two detection zones were used. The carbon working electrode was coated with chitosan-BSA (and enzymes for glucose and uric acid). To detect glucose and uric acid, enzymatic reactions were employed. These reactions involve enzyme-catalyzed redox {{reactions of the}} analytes and produce free electrons for electrochemical measurement. Calibration curves were linear (R² > 0. 980) {{in the range of}} 0 - 80 mM for glucose, 0. 09 – 0. 9 mM for dopamine, and 0 – 50 mM for uric acid, respectively.

40|$|Micropatterning of polymer {{substrates}} {{has been}} shown to be effective methodology for the manufacture of capacitive transducers. The method involves creating a positive mask of sessile liquid droplets on a polymer substrate. The droplets define the cavity dimensions and spatial distribution, a subsequent processing stage independently defines the cavity depth. Droplets can be defined in a variety of ways – this paper explores the patterning the droplets, and hence cavities, on the polymer substrate via a pad-printing technique. The <b>printing</b> <b>pad</b> is manufactured using 3 D printing technique, an example pad is illustrated in Figure 1 – essentially the pad comprises an array of styli. The lateral dimensions and spatial distribution of the styli are replicated via the pattern of deposited droplets on the polymer substrate. The morphology of the styli tips has been explored - planar tips were found to droplet patterns with the highest fidelity. Single element air coupled devices operating with a nominal centre frequency of 500 kHz have been constructed and evaluated experimentally. Transducer bandwidths in excess of 100 % were observed with two-way insertion loss of 60 dB being typical...|$|E

40|$|Solar energy {{delivered}} by organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices {{has the potential}} to be a widely adopted source of sustainable electricity for a range of applications. Printing and coating technologies are being investigated as a means of quickly and cost effectively mass-producing OPV devices. This paper uses an analysis framework to review and assess the suitability of printing and coating technologies for delivering marketable OPV products. The analysis framework was developed by linking the OPV materials and fabrication method to the consumer requirements. The consumer requirements were {{delivered by}} the performance characteristics resulting from the device properties. These device properties were produced by the materials and fabrication method, including the printing/coating method. Specific criteria were developed for each of the stages and the interconnections were mapped to allow pathways between the fabrication technique and consumer requirements to be followed. The benefits and limitations of printing and coating processes were reviewed using the analysis framework for inkjet printing, roller printing, screen <b>printing,</b> <b>pad</b> printing, spin coating and spray coating, amongst others. Suitable processes were those that could meet the performance characteristics by the ability to produce nanoscale films, create set patterning and produce a variety of device sizes. The compatibility of the polymer physical properties with the printing/coating method was also important to achieve consistent products. The most suitable process for a particular application was dependent on the target device size and intended use. Identification of effective printing/coating techniques is necessary for rapid scale-up and commercially viable mass-manufacture of OPV products...|$|E

40|$|Transfer <b>pad</b> <b>printing</b> is a {{promising}} technique that allows to overcome restrictions of conventional screen printing regarding front side metallisation of c-Si solar cells. Within this work a <b>pad</b> <b>printed</b> front grid {{in an industrial}} process scenario is evaluated. Technological {{as well as economical}} aspects are addressed. Regarding technological evaluation, contact lines of 45 #mu#m printed on 10 x 10 cm" 2 wafers demonstrate the fine line <b>printing</b> ability of <b>pad</b> <b>printing</b> on large areas. The ability to print on uneven and fragile substrates like EFG material is proven. However, low paste transfer limits the line resistance and, thus, fill factor. Nevertheless, based on an extensive optimization of printing parameters including different pad types, values > 75 % are achieved for double printing.

40|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} in mass printing is repeatability and stability of the ink transfer from the printing plate onto the <b>printing</b> substrate. The <b>pad</b> <b>printing</b> is characterised by indirect ink transfer from a gravure printing plate. Beside area of the printing elements, on the <b>pad</b> <b>printing</b> plate one should take into account their depth as it is a factor which directly influences the printing ink quantity, i. e. overall quality of the printed product. The photopolymer <b>pad</b> <b>printing</b> plate production includes two exposures with UV irradiation, first to make difference between printing and nonprinting areas and second to form partitions (walls) in the printing elements. The duration of the second exposure directly influences the final depth of the printing elements. The aim {{of this paper is to}} determine influence of the second exposure on the depth of the printing elements, consequently on the reproduction of the <b>pad</b> <b>printing</b> plate elements. For this purpose four <b>pad</b> <b>printing</b> plate samples with various coverage tone value fields will be made by variation of the second exposure duration. Results have shown that second exposure duration significantly influences the printing elements size and therefore should be defined precisely in order to form printing elements of desired depth...|$|R

The thesis deals primarily with the research of a printer control system including machine vision. At present printing is manually controlled. Operator knowledge was gathered for use by an expert system to control the process. A novel local corner- matching algorithm was conceived to effect image segmentation, and neuro-fuzzy techniques were used to recognise patterns in printing errors. Non-linear Finite Element Analysis of the rubber printing-pad led to a method for pre-distorting artwork so that it would print undistorted on a curved product. A flexible, more automated printer was developed that achieves a higher printing rate. Ultraviolet-cured inks with improved printability were developed.

40|$|Electrical {{interconnection}} of crystalline silicon {{solar cells}} within a photovoltaic module must reach very {{low levels of}} electrical energy dissipation in conjunction with long-term stability. To meet those demands usually connectors are soldered to screen <b>printed</b> <b>pads</b> on solar cells. This technology requires a solderable electrically conducting grid as well as thermal and mechanical robustness of the cell. Especially thin solar cells could be damaged using the soldering technology. Therefore we investigate the adhesive technology for substitution of the conventional solder process. Commonly available adhesives are tested and evaluated. For the most suitable adhesive the process parameters are optimised with regard to curing temperature, curing time and pressure. The settled process parameters are used for contacting and laminating solar cells. For determination of electrical and mechanical properties resistivity measurements and peeling tests are carried out. The long-term behaviour of the adhesive joints is analysed due to temperature cycling.

The obtained analytical dependencies were used to confirm the explanation of the processes that occur during the fabrication of nanophotonic coverings by <b>pad</b> <b>printing</b> with photopolymer and metal printing plates. As a result of experimental studies, it was determined that the different character of the dependency of integrated luminescence intensity of nanophotonic elements from the percentage of a pad is explained by the use of different types of <b>pad</b> <b>printing</b> plates, where the size of raster points remains constant in one case, and changes in the other case, while the depth of the printing elements accordingly changes or remains constant.
