25|$|Rosenstock-Huessy {{encountered}} {{strong opposition}} at Harvard University to {{the presentation of}} his ideas in social history and other topics, {{all of which were}} based on his Christian faith. Reportedly, Rosenstock-Huessy frequently mentioned God in class. He also often attacked non-religious academic thinking, a teaching tradition assumed by the Harvard faculty to be a prerequisite for high scholarship. Profound differences of opinion ensued and led, in 1935, to his accepting an appointment as <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> philosophy at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. He made his home in nearby Norwich, Vermont. He taught at Dartmouth until his retirement in 1957.|$|E
25|$|Labor spies may be {{referred}} to as spies, operatives, agents, agents provocateurs, saboteurs, infiltrators, informants, spotters, plants, special police, or detectives. However, Dr. Richard C. Cabot, <b>Professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Social</b> Ethics at Harvard, observed that labor spies are different from our normal view of detectives. While detectives investigate people suspected of crimes, the labor spy shadows and spies upon people who are not suspected of having committed any crime, nor are they suspected of planning any crime. During the mid-to-late-19th century, a period during which there was intense distaste for the detective profession, the Pinkerton and Thiel detective agencies referred to their field agents as operatives or testers. The Pinkerton logo inspired the expression private eye.|$|E
25|$|Michael Shepherd {{was born}} on 30 July 1923 in Cardiff of a Jewish family with its roots in Odessa and Poland. He {{attended}} Cardiff High School and pursued his medical studies at the Medical School of Oxford University and the Radcliffe Infirmary. He was there influenced by the teaching of John Ryle, <b>Professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Social</b> Medicine. Whilst under his tutorage, Shepherd was asked to visit a patient {{in her own home}} in Cowley in order to learn about the socio-medical significance of cardiac invalidism. Through such examples, Shepherd discerned the potential value to psychiatry of systematic research into the social causes of mental disorder. After qualifying he went on to complete his house appointments, and also his National Service in the Royal Air Force.|$|E

500|$|Just {{before his}} death in 1946, Keynes told Henry Clay, a <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> {{economics}} and advisor to the Bank of England, of his hopes that Adam Smith's [...] "invisible hand" [...] could help Britain out of the economic hole it was in: [...] "I find myself more and more relying for a solution of our problems on the invisible hand which I tried to eject from economic thinking twenty years ago." ...|$|E
500|$|The Laming {{report was}} criticised by Caroline Abrahams and Deborah Lightfoot of NCH as too narrow, {{focusing}} {{too much on}} the particular case of Victoria Climbié and not on general child protection. According to Harry Ferguson, a <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> work at the University of the West of England, [...] "Laming's report focuses too heavily on the implementation of new structures and fails to understand the keen intuition that child protection work demands". He criticised the approach to child protection of focusing {{too much on the}} worst cases and trying too much to prevent them, rather than having an approach that also celebrates success; and said that focusing too much on any individual case and basing reforms on that was [...] "deeply problematic". Laming responded to criticism by the Association of Directors of Social Services that his recommendations would require much more funding by saying that these arguments lacked [...] "intellectual rigour", and he dismissed claims that his reforms would be too bureaucratic. The Guardian said that the report does not address the issues of frontline staff. Deryk Mead of NCH said, [...] "I do believe that inquiry reports have made a positive difference to the child protection system, and I have every confidence that Lord Laming's report will do so too".|$|E

500|$|On {{the basis}} of such assessments, {{researchers}} such as Cheryl Glenn, Professor at the Pennsylvania State University, argue that Aspasia {{seems to have been}} the only woman in classical Greece to have distinguished herself in the public sphere and must have influenced Pericles in the composition of his speeches. Some scholars believe that Aspasia opened an academy for young women of good families or even invented the Socratic method. However, Robert W. Wallace, Professor of classics at Northwestern University, underscores that [...] "we cannot accept as historical the joke that Aspasia taught Pericles how to speak and hence was a master rhetorician or philosopher". According to Wallace, the intellectual role Aspasia was given by Plato may have derived from comedy. Kagan describes Aspasia as [...] "a beautiful, independent, brilliantly witty young woman capable of holding her own in conversation with the best minds in Greece and of discussing and illuminating any kind of question with her husband". Roger Just, a classicist and <b>Professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> anthropology at the University of Kent, believes that Aspasia was an exceptional figure, but her example alone is enough to underline the fact that any woman who was to become the intellectual and social equal of a man {{would have to be a}} hetaera. According to Sr. Prudence Allen, a philosopher and seminary professor, Aspasia moved the potential of women to become philosophers one step forward from the poetic inspirations of Sappho.|$|E
