5000|$|Labor {{in silver}} mines was paid labor of free workers. There {{was a brief}} period of mining in central and {{southern}} Mexico that mobilized indigenous men's involuntary labor by the repartimiento, but Mexico's mines developed in the north outside of the zone of dense indigenous settlement. They were ethnically mixed and mobile, becoming culturally part of the Hispanic sphere even if their origins were indigenous. Mine workers were generally well paid with a daily wage of 4 reales per day plus a share of the ore produced, the partido. In some cases, the partido was worth more than the daily wage. Mine owners sought to terminate the <b>practice.</b> <b>Mine</b> workers pushed back against mine owners, particularly in a 1766 strike at the Real del Monte mine, owned by the Conde de Regla, in which they closed down the mine and murdered a royal official.

40|$|The {{camera is}} usually {{considered}} to be a passive tool {{under the control of the}} operator. This definition implicitly constrains how we use the medium, as well as how we look at – and what we see in – its interpretations of scenes, objects, events and ‘moments’. This text will suggest another way of thinking about – and using – the photographic medium. Based on the evidence of photographic <b>practice</b> (<b>mine</b> and others’), I will suggest that, as a result of the ways in which the medium interprets, juxtaposes and renders the elements in front of the lens, the camera is capable of depicting scenes, events and moments that did not exist and could not have existed until brought into being by the act of photographing them. Accordingly, I will propose that the affective power of many photographs is inseparable from their ‘photographicness’ – and that the photographic medium should therefore be considered as an active collaborator in the creation of uniquely photographic images...|$|E
40|$|Best <b>practice</b> <b>mine</b> closure {{planning}} and {{environmental impact assessment}} (EIA) principles share many common features. This research examined how mine closure planning relates to, and can be integrated with EIA by comparing practice in eight African and Australian jurisdictions. Emphasis was placed on key challenges and opportunities associated with: institutional arrangements for mine closure planning; financial mechanisms for mine site closure and rehabilitation including abandoned/legacy mine sites; transparency of mine closure {{planning and}} financing provisions; and regulation of artisanal and small-scale mining activity. Data were gathered through document analysis, interviews and interactions with practitioners from Western Australia, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Mozambique, South Africa, Tanzania and Zambia. Issues associated with mine closure planning and rehabilitation under existing arrangements and opportunities for improvement through existing EIA processes already in place in each jurisdiction are explored. All eight jurisdictions have appropriate regulatory provisions in place already, but implementation capacity remains a challenge. Opportunities for effective practice lie in using mine closure planning and EIA measures in an integrated fashion, avoiding duplication and enabling synergies in management to be realised...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Sustainable mining {{concepts}} are being applied to current mining practices; however, assessment tools or criterion for best available <b>mining</b> and reclamation <b>practices</b> are needed.

This paper uses an {{environmental management system}} methodology to evaluate the sustainability of pollution prevention practices, such as in-situ mining and mineral processing circuits that produce desulfured tails, and ameliorative <b>practices</b> that employ <b>mine</b> waste covers and reclamation.

However, there are some common shortcomings of existing <b>mining</b> closure planning <b>practice</b> in Canada and Australia. These include inadequate social impact assessment, community consultation, inadequate analysis of alternative options, and the monitoring of post-closure activities.
