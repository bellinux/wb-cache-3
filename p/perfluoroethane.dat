40|$|Although {{the potency}} of {{conventional}} anesthetics correlates with lipophilicity, an affinity to water also is essential. It was recently found that compounds with very low affinities to water do not produce anesthesia regardless of their lipophilicity. This finding implies that clinical anesthesia might arise because of interactions at molecular sites near the interface of neuronal membranes with the aqueous environment and, therefore, might require increased concentrations of anesthetic molecules at membrane interfaces. As an initial test of this hypothesis, we calculated in molecular dynamics simulations the free energy profiles for the transfer of anesthetic 1, 1, 2 -trifluoroethane and nonanesthetic <b>perfluoroethane</b> across water-membrane and water-hexane interfaces. Consistent with the hypothesis, {{it was found that}} trifluoroethane, but not <b>perfluoroethane,</b> exhibits a free energy minimum and, therefore, increased concentrations at both interfaces. The transfer of trifluoroethane from water to the nonpolar hexane or interior of the membrane is accompanied by a considerable, solvent-induced shift in the conformational equilibrium around the C-C bond...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} {{relationship}} between day one post-operative intra-ocular pressure and patient demographic information, lens status, tamponade medium (air, <b>perfluoroethane,</b> sulfur hexafluoride) and laser treatment. Methods: A prospective observational study of all patients undergoing pars plana vitrectomy by a single surgeon within one case study.

40|$|Application of gas-solid {{chromatography}} techiques to {{the separation of}} low molecular weight fluorocarbons incorporates a number of advantages over previous analysis techniques. These advantages include isothermal operation up to 200 [deg], elimination of substrate bleed, stability of the base line, minimum retention times and convenience. The relative retention volumes with respect to <b>perfluoroethane</b> {{of a number of}} low molecular weight fluorocarbons as a function of column support material and operating conditios are reported.

40|$|PURPOSE. To {{report a}} case of {{symptomatic}} myopic retinoschisis with foveolar detachment and lamellar macular hole, treated with expansible gas. METHODS. Interventional case report. A myopic patient presented {{with a history of}} decreased vision and metamorphopsia in his right eye. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) revealed an increased macular thickness, thinning and separation of the inner and external retina (retinoschisis or foveoschisis), foveolar detachment, lamellar hole, and foveolar vitreous traction. We treated the patient with a single dose of 0. 2 mL of <b>perfluoroethane</b> (C(2) F(6)), performed under retrobulbar anesthesia, followed by prone posturing for 15 days. RESULTS. OCT showed reattachment of the foveolar retina, disappearance of the retinoschisis, and visual acuity improvement. CONCLUSIONS. Intraocular expansible gas and prone posturing, without vitrectomy, could be an alternative treatment in selected cases of symptomatic macular foveoschisis with foveolar detachment, in the absence of dense epiretinal membranes.

40|$|Sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6), {{perfluoromethane}} (CF 4) and <b>perfluoroethane</b> (C 2 F 6) {{are strong}} greenhouse gases with long (> 1000 year) atmospheric residence times. We derive emission factors {{for the major}} anthropogenic sources and project future emissions for 5 regions and the world. Although firms in many industrialized countries are already limiting emissions, without further policy intervention global emissions will rise 150 % (CF 4 and C 2 F 6) and 210 % (SF 6) between 1990 and 2050; radiative forcing will increase 0. 026 W m- 2. Full application of available low-cost and costless policies in industrialized nations would cut that radiative forcing by one-quarter. Increased forcing due to these gases is small (< 2 %) relative to other gases but permanent on the timescale of human civilization. We also quantify plausible manipulations to governmental data {{that will be used}} to determine compliance with the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which includes commitments for industrialized countries to regulate these and other greenhouse gases. More complete and transparent data are urgently needed. West European nations, for example, can ‘cut’ their emissions of these gases by half by 2010 simply by manipulating emission factors within the current bounds of uncertainty...|$|E
40|$|Sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6), {{perfluoromethane}} (CF 4) and <b>perfluoroethane</b> (C 2 F 6) {{are strong}} greenhouse gases with long atmospheric residence times. Under the Kyoto Protocol to the Framework Convention on Climate Change adopted in December 1997, industrialized nations agreed to regulate their emissions of these gases. Here {{we present a}} simple spreadsheet model that is useful for projecting future emissions and analyzing compliance with regulatory commitments. We use atmospheric measurements of these gases and engineering studies to derive emission factors and scenarios {{for each of the}} major anthropogenic sources (leakage from electrical equipment, magnesium casting, aluminum smelting and semiconductor fabrication). Our model is useful for policy analysis because it divides the world into regions of nations that correspond with the political coalitions that dominate the international negotiations through which regulatory commitments are adopted. We show that although firms in many industrialized countries are already limiting emissions, without further policy intervention global emissions will rise 150 % (CF 4 and C 2 F 6) and 210 % (SF 6) between 1990 to 2050; radiative forcing will increase 0. 026 W m- 2. Full application of available low- and negative-cost policies in industrialized nations would cut that radiative forcing by one-quarter. We also quantify plausible future manipulations to governmental data and show their possible effect on compliance with the targets of the Kyoto Protocol. West European nations can "cut" their emissions of these gases by half by 2010 simply by manipulating emission factors within the current bounds of uncertainty. The need for more complete and transparent data on these gases is urgent. ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} postoperative prone posturing for a single night {{in the outcome of}} trans pars plana vitrectomy (TPPV) with internal limiting membrane (ILM) peel and 20 % <b>perfluoroethane</b> (C 2 F 6) internal tamponade for idiopathic macular hole. Methods. This prospective trial enrolled 14 eyes in 14 consecutive patients with idiopathic macular hole. All eyes underwent TPPV with vision blue assisted ILM peeling with and without phacoemulsification and intraocular lens (IOL) for macular hole. Intraocular gas tamponade (20 % C 2 F 6) was used in all cases with postoperative face-down posturing overnight and without specific posturing afterwards. LogMAR visual acuity, appearance by slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and ocular coherence tomography (OCT) scans were compared preoperatively and postoperatively to assess outcome. Results. Among 14 eyes recruited, all eyes were phakic; 50 % of patients underwent concurrent phacoemulsification with IOL. The macular holes were categorized preoperatively by OCT appearance, 4 (28. 57 %) were stage 2, 7 (50 %) were stage 3, and 3 (21. 43 %) were stage 4. Mean macular hole size was 0. 35 disk diameters. Symptoms of macular hole had been present for an average of 6. 5 months. All holes (100 %) were closed 3 and 6 months postoperatively. Mean visual acuity (logMAR) was improved to 0. 61 at 3 months and was stable at 6 months after the surgery. None of the eyes had worse vision postoperatively. Conclusions. Vitrectomy with ILM peeling and 20 % C 2 F 6 gas with a brief postoperative 1 night prone posturing regimen is a reasonable approach to achieve anatomic closure in idiopathic macular hole. Concurrent cataract extraction did not alter outcomes and was not associated with any additional complications...|$|E
40|$|In this work, the {{analytical}} SAFT-γ Mie {{equation of state}} (EoS) {{is used in the}} efficient development of intermolecular force field parameters which can be used in direct molecular simulation for a range of fused dimer molecules. In its original formulation, the SAFT-γ Mie EoS only provides a direct link to the force field parameters for tangent models. A novel development here is to extend the application of the equation of state to obtain intermolecular potentials for fused models which more faithfully mimic realistic molecules. The proposed methodology consists of a two stage process: - An empirical mapping between the parameters of the theory and parameters used in simulation is first obtained by performing molecular dynamics simulations of the vapour-liquid equilibria {{for a wide range of}} homonuclear model dimer molecules with different bond lengths and Mie repulsive exponents. The simulation results are matched with those obtained using the theory for corresponding systems in order to determine the relationship between the parameters of the theory and the potential model. A methodology for obtaining unlike interaction parameters in heteronuclear dimer molecules is also developed and validated. - The mapping obtained is then used to translate the equation of state parameters of real molecules into a simulation force field with an explicit bond length. Force fields are obtained for a range of molecules with different levels of molecular resolution including atomistic models for molecular oxygen and nitrogen, united-atom models for ethane and <b>perfluoroethane</b> and more coarse-grained dimer models of propylbenzene and carbon dioxide. The properties obtained by simulation include vapour pressures, saturated liquid densities and interfacial tensions. This top-down methodology of obtaining force field parameters for computer simulation of fluids is much less computer and time intensive than the traditional methods. In the concluding chapter, a preliminary extension of the approach to trimers molecules is presented. Open Acces...|$|E
