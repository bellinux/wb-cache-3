30|$|Patients and methods: Twenty-one {{patients}} ventilated for duration {{more than}} 5  days suspected of VAP were included.

40|$|As <b>pulmonary</b> <b>CT</b> {{has a lot}} {{of noise}} {{produced}} by thoracic imaging and partial volume effect, it is difficult that the computer segments out the correct blood vessels for plain thoracic CT. Therefore, after a deep investigation into the enhancement, segmentation methods and the upgrading ability of fractional differential operation, the paper proposes an automatic segmentation method for pulmonary vessel in the plain thoracic CT scans. The method steps are: <b>pulmonary</b> <b>CT</b> images have been enhanced with fractional differential operator firstly, and the image regions have been divided into sub-regions based on two control indexes, then a local optimal threshold is used for the vessels segmentation in each sub-region.

40|$|The overall aim of my PhD {{research}} {{work is to}} design, develop, and evaluate a new practical environment to generate separated representations of arterial and venous trees in non-contrast <b>pulmonary</b> <b>CT</b> imaging of human subjects and to extract quantitative measures at different tree-levels. Artery/vein (A/V) separation is of substantial importance contributing {{to our understanding of}} pulmonary structure and function, and immediate clinical applications exist, e. g., for assessment of pulmonary emboli. Separated A/V trees may also significantly boost performance of airway segmentation methods for higher tree generations. Although, non-contrast <b>pulmonary</b> <b>CT</b> imaging successfully captures higher tree generations of vasculature, A/V are indistinguishable by their intensity values, and often, there is no trace of intensity variation at locations of fused arteries and veins. Patient-specific structural abnormalities of vascular trees further complicate the task. We developed a novel multi-scale topo-morphologic opening algorithm to separate A/V trees in non-contrast CT images. The algorithm combines fuzzy distance transform, a morphologic feature, with a topologic connectivity and a new morphological reconstruction step to iteratively open multi-scale fusions starting at large scales and progressing towards smaller scales. The algorithm has been successfully applied on fuzzy vessel segmentation results using interactive seed selection via an efficient graphical user interface developed as a part of my PhD project. Accuracy, reproducibility and efficiency of the system are quantitatively evaluated using computer-generated and physical phantoms along with in vivo animal and human data sets and the experimental results formed are quite encouraging. Also, we developed an arc-skeleton based volumetric tree generation algorithm to generate multi-level volumetric tree representation of isolated arterial/venous tree and to extract vascular measurements at different tree levels. The method has been applied on several computer generated phantoms and CT images of pulmonary vessel cast and in vivo <b>pulmonary</b> <b>CT</b> images of a pig at different airway pressure. Experimental results have shown that the method is quite accurate and reproducible. Finally, we developed a new pulmonary vessel segmentation algorithm, i. e., a new anisotropic constrained region growing method that encourages axial region growing while arresting cross-structure leaking. The region growing is locally controlled by tensor scale and structure scale and anisotropy. The method has been successfully applied on several non-contrast <b>pulmonary</b> <b>CT</b> images of human subjects. The accuracy of the new method has been evaluated using manually selection of vascular and non-vascular voxels and the results found are very promising...|$|E

40|$|Computed tomographic (<b>CT)</b> <b>pulmonary</b> {{angiography}} {{has been}} established as a first-line diagnostic technique in patients suspected of having pulmonary embolism. Risk stratification is important in patients with pulmonary embolism because optimal management, monitoring, and therapeutic strategies depend on the prognosis. Acute right-sided heart failure {{is known to be}} responsible for circulatory collapse and death in patients with severe pulmonary embolism. Acute right-sided heart failure can be assessed at <b>CT</b> <b>pulmonary</b> angiography by measuring the dimensions of right-sided heart cavities or upstream venous structures, such as the superior vena cava or azygos vein. The magnitude of pulmonary embolism can be calculated at <b>CT</b> <b>pulmonary</b> angiography by applying angiographic scores adapted for CT (Miller and Walsh scores) or dedicated CT scores (Qanadli and Mastora scores). The advent of <b>CT</b> <b>pulmonary</b> angiography performed with electrocardiographic gating permits new advances in assessment of acute right-sided heart failure, such as measurement of the ventricular ejection fraction.

CT examinations were quantified for coronary artery calcium volume, pulmonary emphysema (perc 15) and bronchial wall thickness (pi 10). Data were analysed via a Cox proportional hazard analysis, net reclassification improvement (NRI) and C-indices. 184 participants experienced a cardiovascular event during a median follow-up of 2. 9 years.

40|$|PURPOSE: To compare {{radiation}} dose delivered at four- and 16 -detector row computed tomography (CT) with a dose-modulation program and that delivered at digital angiography {{for evaluation of}} pulmonary embolism (PE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The {{part of the study}} involving patients (seven women, four men; mean age, 62 years +/- 16 [standard deviation]; range, 41 - 85 years) was approved by the institutional review board. Patients gave written informed consent. Exposure was performed with an anthropomorphic phantom with thermoluminescent dosimeters for four-detector row CT without the dose-modulation program and 16 -detector row CT without and with the dose-modulation program with standard protocols for <b>pulmonary</b> <b>CT</b> angiography (120 kV, 144 mAs, four and 16 detector rows with 1. 00 - and 0. 75 -mm section thickness, respectively). Digital angiograms were acquired with four standard projections at 80 kV. For digital angiography, {{radiation dose}} was calculated according to phantom measurements and adapted to acquisition and fluoroscopy times. Distribution of dose was compared for CT and digital angiography. RESULTS: During <b>pulmonary</b> <b>CT</b> angiography, mean radiation dose delivered at middle of chest was 21. 5, 19. 5, and 18. 2 mGy for four-detector row CT and for 16 -detector row CT without and with dose-modulation program, respectively. At the same level, a mean dose of 91 mGy was delivered with digital angiography. The dose adjusted to clinical conditions was 139. 0 mGy for digital angiography and could be reduced after technical adjustment. Ratios of maximum dose to mean dose were 1. 15 and 2. 96 for CT and digital angiography, respectively. With application of the dose-modulation program at 16 -detector row CT, radiation dose was reduced 15 %- 20 % at the upper chest.

MethodsA retrospective study of patients admitted with pulmonary embolism confirmed by <b>CT</b> <b>pulmonary</b> angiogram to three teaching hospitals in East Scotland between January 2005 and July 2007. Two radiologists judged presence of right ventricular dilation on <b>CT</b> <b>pulmonary</b> angiogram independently. The outcome of interest was 30 day mortality. Multivariable logistic regression was used to compare this outcome in patients with right ventricular dilation compared to those without right ventricular dilation, adjusting for Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index score. ResultsThere were 585 patients included and 30. 4 % had right ventricular dilation on <b>CT</b> <b>pulmonary</b> angiogram. Patients with right ventricular dilation had increased 30 day mortality rates compared to patients without right ventricular dilation (12. 4 % vs. 5. 4 %; p= 0. 006). Survival analysis showed that a significantly greater proportion of deaths in the right ventricular dilation group occurred within the first 48 h after admission compared to the group without right ventricular dilation (45. 5 % deaths vs. 9. 1 %; p= 0. 016). On multivariable analysis, adjusting for Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index score, right ventricular dilation was independently associated with increased 30 day mortality (OR 2. 98; 95 % CI 1. 54 – 5. 75; p= 0. 001).
