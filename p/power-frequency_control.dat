The one machine infinite bus system model with <b>power-frequency</b> <b>control</b> system was established and the corresponding root-locus equation was deduced. The parameter stability region of <b>power-frequency</b> <b>control</b> system to ensure the power system dynamic stability was achieved through drawing root locus graphs of different system running modes. If the gain value of <b>power-frequency</b> <b>control</b> system {{is higher than the}} critical value, power system low frequency oscillation will occur. The above conclusion was validated by time domain simulation results...|$|E

30|$|Hierarchical {{architectures}} {{are used}} to solve problems with different time scales in power-frequency and var-voltage control systems. In <b>power-frequency</b> <b>control</b> systems, unit commitment (UC) and economic dispatch (ED) {{are used to}} determine the generation schedules over the next day. The schedules are also updated approximately every 15 min according to a tertiary frequency control (TFC) algorithm that solves real-time ED problems for ultra-short-term load forecasts. The secondary frequency control (SFC) and primary frequency control (PFC) methods are, respectively, responsible for making and executing commands over shorter time scales. Var-voltage control is similar to <b>power-frequency</b> <b>control</b> in most situations. For instance, tertiary voltage control (TVC) sets the reference pilot bus voltage curves with the same frequency as TFC. However, as multi-timescale coupling is considered insignificant in var-voltage control, longer time scales, such as those relevant to scheduling an entire day, have been considered in only a few studies. This rarely causes problems because, in general, these systems have an abundance of reactive power, and the state of the system is not dominated by time-coupled behaviors.|$|E

40|$|Abstractâ€”In this paper, an {{improved}} droop control strategy {{is presented to}} restrict the maximum power of inverters and to enhance the accuracy of reactive power sharing for parallel inverters in low voltage microgrid. The improved method can decouple active and reactive power through rotating orthogonal transformation, and extend traditional droop control to low voltage microgrid. The presented sine virtual active <b>power-frequency</b> droop <b>control</b> can restrict the maximum power of inverters without adding droop controlling unit of amplitude limits, and can enhance the accuracy of reactive power sharing. A microgrid simulation model is built in Matlab/Simulink simulation platform, and simulation analyses verify the validity and feasibility of the proposed strategy.

40|$|Abstract- in {{transmission}} line, {{there are}} large quantities of distributed generators in micro-grid, which are all connected with PCC (Point of Common Coupling) through inverters. The droop control method is widely used to distribute active and reactive power among parallel inverters because its properties of low cost, high stability and no need of communication channel. In a micro-grid, the inductance values of transmission lines connecting to respective inverters are different due to the low density of distributed generators. In addition the settling time of the traditional droop control is high. In that situation, the reactive power cannot be equally shared even if all the inverters are using the same droop control method. With regards to this problem, a modification, called virtual impedance loop, is put forward for the droop control strategy to share reactive power equally in this paper. To improve the system response and settling time the arctan function also implement in <b>power-frequency</b> droop <b>control</b> strategy. The feasibility of the design is validated by simulation...|$|R
30|$|In {{the case}} of <b>power-frequency</b> <b>control</b> systems, {{uncertainties}} {{are taken into account}} by UC and ED problems. Four methods for managing uncertainties in system operation are discussed in [7]. Many studies have focused on the fourth method, robust optimization, because it uses a modest amount of knowledge and is universally applicable. In particular, researchers use a two-stage version of this method, where the decision variables are divided into two types and are input into different stages of the optimization algorithm. In the first stage, only the on/off states of units that cannot be corrected frequently are considered. This ensures that when another decision variable modifies the state of the system, the system maintains the best performance, even under the worst conditions [8, 9, 10, 11].|$|E
30|$|The {{ability of}} {{communication}} (and therefore coordination) between grid components {{can be seen}} as the defining aspect of smart grids in contrast to conventional power grids. Therefore, communications play a major role. As outlined in Section 2, the primary reason why communications are needed is the more decentralised structure of power grids that results from a wide application of renewable energy resources. Conventional communication strategies in the grid, such as <b>power-frequency</b> <b>control,</b> are designed for a low number of active nodes (adjustable generators) in the grid [12]. More distributed systems require a higher level of coordination in order to maintain stability [13]. However, not only power balancing requires communication. Besides today's Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), there are three major application domains for communications in smart grids.|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{wind power}} {{penetration}} in power systems {{has resulted in}} an urgent need {{for the assessment of}} their impact on grid security. Besides the participation in voltage control, there also exists a growing interest in the delivering of other ancillary services like <b>power-frequency</b> <b>control.</b> This paper investigates further the technical feasibility of delivering frequency support with wind turbines in a small power system. Different control mechanisms are elaborated in Matlab/Simulink to deliver frequency support in the case where the turbines have a power reserve available and in the case where they are operating at maximum available power. Also the influence of the generation mix is examined. Results reveal that the displacement of conventional generation with wind power results in a deterioration of the frequency response. However, due to the implementation of the different control mechanisms presented in this paper for delivering inertial response and primary control, the frequency stability is improved. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{power quality}} of a low voltage {{distributed}} network is vulnerable to the plunge {{of a large number}} of distributed power sources, which could be at serious risk due to high circulating current. In order to overcome this problem, this paper proposes an active power-magnitude and reactive <b>power-frequency</b> droop <b>control</b> scheme for distributed voltage source inverters without a communication line. A novel dynamic virtual resistance control solution is demonstrated to minimize dynamic circulating current based on satisfied output voltage accuracy and stability. Differential and integral terms are added to the droop formulas to enhance the dynamic performance of the inverter and improve the stability for voltage magnitude and frequency. MATLAB simulations show that stable output voltage and small circulating current can be achieved in both grid connected mode and islanding mode by using the proposed scheme. This result is further verified by an experimental testing with two parallel voltage source inverters. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract â€” This paper {{presents}} an online controller for tracking power-budgets in multicore processors using dynamic voltage-frequency scaling. The proposed control law comprises an integral controller whose gain is adjusted online {{based on the}} derivative of the <b>power-frequency</b> relationship. The <b>control</b> law is designed to achieve rapid settling time, and its tracking property is formally proven. Importantly, the controller design does not require off-line analysis of application workloads making it feasible for emerging heterogeneous and asymmetric multicore processors. Simulation results are presented for controlling power dissipation in multiple cores of an asymmetric multicore processor. Each core is i) equipped with the controller, ii) assigned a power budget, and iii) operates independently in tracking to its power budget. We use a cycle-level multicore simulator driven by traces from SPEC 2006 benchmarks demonstrating that the proposed algorithm achieves a faster settling time than examples of a static setting of the controller gain.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the <b>power-frequency</b> <b>control</b> of {{hydropower}} plants with long penstocks is addressed. In such configuration {{the effects of}} pressure waves cannot be neglected and therefore commonly used criteria for adjustment of PID governors would not be appropriate. A second-order Î  model of the turbine-penstock based on a lumped parameter approach is considered. A correction factor is introduced in order to approximate the model frequency response to the continuous case in the frequency interval of interest. Using this model, several criteria are analysed for adjusting the PI governor of a hydropower plant operating in an isolated system. Practical criteria for adjusting the PI governor are given. The results are applied to a real case of a small island where {{the objective is to}} achieve a generation 100 % renewable (wind and hydro). Frequency control is supposed to be provided exclusively by the hydropower plant. It is verified that the usual criterion for tuning the PI controller of isolated hydro plants gives poor results. However, with the new proposed adjustment, the time response is considerably improve...|$|E

40|$|Microgrids are a {{group of}} {{distributed}} generation systems that enable the support of local loads and {{have the ability to}} connect and disconnect to the main electrical utility grid. To respond to the increase in electrical power requirements from the customer base, Microgrids are a useful method of achieving network expansion, but have a number of protection issues related to reliability of supply, which is why the need of some form of microgrid control is required. This thesis report includes an analysis of droop control methods for control of a microgrid when connected to the distributed network, and when operating in islanded mode. The microgrid control strategies investigated as part of this report included an initial analysis of the various methods, and a more detailed analysis of synchronous generator control, including cooperative droop. This method has an improved response in regards to voltage regulation, frequency regulations and active power sharing. The use of droop control including primary and secondary control, to ensure the reliability of the network supply in the event of minor disruption includes events such as a load increase or decrease and larger disruptions that occur such as the loss of a generator, or the main electricity grid. It was found through the investigation of the governor control and the use of <b>power-frequency</b> droop <b>control,</b> that active power and frequency remained within the defined parameters of as set by the standard. Voltage regulation did have some events that caused the Distributed Generation (DG) voltage to exceed the limits, which is attributed to the grid-restoration event and would benefit from further investigation into control methods that would better support these types of events...|$|R

40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{approach to}} the development of the startup mode design for the Advanced Lead Fast Reactor European Demonstrator (ALFRED) currently under development within the European FP 7 LEADER (Lead-cooled European Advanced Demonstration Reactor) Project has been undertaken. The reactor startup is the operational mode in which all the operating systems of the plant are brought from the cold shutdown condition to the full power operating status, close to <b>power-frequency</b> <b>control.</b> In this phase, the working conditions radically change and it is fundamental that the several control actions are properly coordinated. These aspects deserve a particular attention in a new generation reactor, whose management is not fully defined and for which the control strategy has to be finalized. In the developing of the ALFRED reactor control system, it is then necessary to provide an adequate formalization of the sequence of the several control actions to be performed. For this purpose, Petri net approach has been employed in this work, since it represents a useful formalism for the modelling and the analysis of discrete event systems and it allows to identify the events coming from the plant, which enable the switches among the several feedback controllers. In the first part of the paper, the issues characterizing the startup mode are described and some solutions to bring the reactor to full power mode (fulfilling the technological constraints) are provided. Then, the results of the simulations related to the ALFRED output variables and control variables are discussed...|$|E
