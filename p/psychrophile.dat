5000|$|In 1940, ZoBell and Conn {{stated that}} they have never {{encountered}} [...] "true psychrophiles" [...] or organisms that grow best at relatively low temperatures. In 1958, J. L. Ingraham supported this by concluding that {{there are very few}} or possibly no bacteria that fit the textbook definitions of <b>psychrophiles.</b> Richard Y. Morita emphasizes this by using the term psychrotrophoc to describe organisms that do not meet the definition of <b>psychrophiles.</b> The confusion between the terms psychrotrophs and <b>psychrophiles</b> was started because investigators were unaware of the thermolability of psychrophilic organisms at the laboratory temperatures. Due to this, early investigators did not determine the cardinal temperatures for their isolates.The similarity between these two is that they are both capable of growing at zero, but optimum and upper temperature limits for the growth are lower for <b>psychrophiles</b> compared to psychrotrophs. <b>Psychrophiles</b> are also more often isolated from permanently cold habitats compared to psychrotrophs. Although psychrophilic enzymes remain under-used because the cost of production and processing at low temperatures is higher than for the commercial enzymes that are presently in use, the attention and resurgence of research interest in <b>psychrophiles</b> and psychrotrophs will be a contributor to the betterment of the environment and the desire to conserve energy.|$|R

Some groups of psychrophilic fungi live in oxygen-poor areas under alpine snowfields. A further group of eukaryotic cold-adapted organisms are snow algae, which can cause watermelon snow. Some multicellular eukaryotes can also be metabolically active at negative temperatures, such as some conifers that can still photosynthesize when it is several degrees under 0 °C (conifers are often more cold-resistant than broadleaf trees). <b>Psychrophiles</b> are interesting enzymes that are very useful models in the research of proteins. <b>Psychrophiles</b> are characterized by lipid cell membranes chemically resistant to the stiffening caused by extreme cold, and often create protein 'antifreezes' to keep their internal space liquid and protect their DNA even in temperatures below water's freezing point. A commonly accepted hypothesis for this cold adaptation is the activity-stability-flexibility relationship, suggesting that psychrophilic enzymes increase the flexibility of their structure to compensate for the 'freezing effect' of cold habitats.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Cold adapted or psychrophilic organisms grow at low temperatures, {{where most}} of other organisms cannot grow. This {{adaptation}} requires {{a vast array of}} sequence, structural and physiological adjustments. To understand the molecular basis of cold adaptation of proteins, we analyzed proteomes of psychrophilic and mesophilic bacterial species and compared the differences in amino acid composition and substitution patterns to investigate their likely association with growth temperatures. Results In psychrophilic bacteria, serine, aspartic acid, threonine and alanine are overrepresented in the coil regions of secondary structures, whilst glutamic acid and leucine are underrepresented in the helical regions. Compared to mesophiles, <b>psychrophiles</b> comprise a significantly higher proportion of amino acids that contribute to higher protein flexibility in the coil regions of proteins, such as those with tiny/small or neutral side chains. Amino acids with aliphatic, basic, aromatic and hydrophilic side chains are underrepresented in the helical regions of proteins of <b>psychrophiles.</b> The patterns of amino acid substitutions between the orthologous proteins of <b>psychrophiles</b> versus mesophiles are significantly different for several amino acids when compared to their substitutions in orthologous proteins of within the mesophiles or <b>psychrophiles.</b> Conclusion Current results provide quantitative substitution preferences (or avoidance) of amino acids that lead to the adaptation of proteins to cold temperatures. These finding would help future efforts in selecting mutations for rational design of proteins with enhanced psychrophilic properties. </p...|$|R

At all stations, lower temperature incubations generated significantly higher most probable number (MPN) estimates.

40|$|Analysis of {{deoxyribonucleic acid}} (DNA) from four species of Clostridium, {{including}} two thermophiles, a mesophile, and a <b>psychrophile,</b> revealed no obvious relationship between growth temperature and DNA base composition. The melting temperatures (Tm) of the DNA {{from the four}} species varied no more among the thermophilic, mesophilic, and psychrophilic species than among many related mesophilic species. Characterization of ribosomes from the clostridia by means of optical rotatory dispersion yielded similar spectra in common with other unrelated organisms. Only small differences were noted in the base composition of ribosomal ribonucleic acid (RNA) and in the amino acid composition of ribosomal proteins, including half-cystine content, as determined by cysteic acid analysis, and accessible sulfhydryl groups, as determined by titration with dithiobis (2 -nitrobenzoic acid). Except for the two thermophiles, the ribosomal protein electrophoretic patterns were dissimilar. No unusual thermal stability was manifested in the Tm values of thermophile ribosomal RNA. However, thermophile ribosome Tm values (69 C) were higher than were mesophile and <b>psychrophile</b> Tm values (64 C). Ribosomes from the four clostridial species were also examined {{in regard to the}} effect of heat on their functional integrity, measured by their activity in poly U-directed 14 C-phenylaline incorporation, and their gross physical integrity, measured by sucrose gradient analysis. The Td, 5 values (temperature which produces 50 % inactivation after 5 min) was found to be 70 and 72 C for the two thermophiles C. tartarivorum and C. thermosaccharolyticum, respectively; 57 C for a mesophile, C. pasteurianum; and 53 C for a <b>psychrophile,</b> Clostridium sp. strain 69. At 55 C, little effect was seen on the thermophile ribosomes, but the mesophile ribosomes lost 90 % of their activity in 1 hr, and <b>psychrophile</b> ribosomes lost 100 % of their activity within 10 min. According to sucrose gradient profiles, heating at 55 C results in dissociation of mesophile ribosomes and aggregation of <b>psychrophile</b> ribosomes.

Production of ω- 3 and ω- 6 polyunsaturated fatty acids by fermentative way. Obligate psychrophilic, facultative psychrophilic and mesophilic yeasts were cultured in a carbon rich medium at different temperatures to investigate if growth parameters, lipid accumulation and fatty acid composition were adaptive and/or acclimatory responses. Acclimation of facultative <b>psychrophiles</b> and mesophiles to lower temperature negatively affected their specific growth rate. Obligate <b>psychrophiles</b> exhibited the highest biomass yield (YX/S), followed by facultative <b>psychrophiles,</b> then by mesophiles. The growth temperature did not influence the YX/S of facultative <b>psychrophiles</b> and mesophiles. Acclimation to lower temperature caused {{the increase in}} lipid yield (YL/X) in mesophilic yeasts, but did not affect YL/X in facultative <b>psychrophiles.</b> Similar YL/X were found in both facultative and obligated <b>psychrophiles,</b> suggesting that lipid accumulation is not a distinctive character of adaptation to permanently cold environments. The extent of unsaturation of fatty acids was one major adaptive feature of the yeasts which colonize permanently cold ecosystems. Remarkable amounts of α-linolenic acid were found in obligate <b>psychrophiles</b> at the expenses of linoleic acid, whereas it was generally scarce or absent in all the others strains. Increased unsaturation of fatty acids was also an acclimatory response of mesophiles and facultative <b>psychrophiles</b> to lower temperature. It’s well known that omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) display a variety of beneficial effects on various organ systems and diseases, therefore a process for the microbial production of omega- 3 PUFAs would be of great interest. This work sought also to investigate {{if one of the}} better psychrophilic yeast, Rhodotorula glacialis DBVPG 4785, stimulated by acclamatory responses, produced omega- 3 PUFAs. In fact, the adaptation of psychrophilic yeasts to cold niches is related to the production of higher amounts of lipids and to increased unsaturation degree of fatty acids, presumably to maintain membrane fluidity and functionality at low temperatures. Bioreactor fermentations of Rhodotorula glacialis DBVPG 4785 were carried out at 25, 20, 15, 10, 5, 0, and - 3 °C in a complex medium with high C:N ratio for 15 days. High biomass production was attained at all the temperatures with a similar biomass/glucose yield (YXS), between 0. 40 and 0. 45, but the specific growth rate of the strain decreased as the temperature diminished. The coefficients YL/X have been measured between a minimum of 0. 50 to a maximum of 0. 67, but {{it was not possible to}} show a clear effect of temperature. Similarly, the coefficient YL/S ranges from a minimum of 0. 22 to a maximum of 0. 28 : again, it does not appear to be any significant changes due to temperature. Among omega- 3 PUFAs, only α-linolenic acid (ALA, 18 : 3 n- 3) was found at temperatures below to 0 °C, while, it’s remarkable, that the worthy arachidonic acid (C 20 : 4,n- 6), stearidonic acid (C 20 : 4,n- 3) C 22 : 0 and docosahexaenoic acid (C 22 : 6 n- 3) were produced only at the late exponential phase and the stationary phase of batch fermentations at 0 and - 3 °C. The docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is a beneficial omega- 3 PUFA that is usually found in fatty fish and fish oils.
