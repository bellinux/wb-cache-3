40|$|Abstract. The main {{patterns}} of the proton precipitation in the atmosphere were described already in the 1970 s. The blue-shifted Doppler profiles of hydrogen lines are associated with proton precipitations. It is accepted that these profiles contain information about distribution in the <b>precipitated</b> <b>particle</b> flux. However, some peculiarities of these profiles, namely, the red-shifted wing are not well understood. This red wing is usually explained by large angle scattering at the collision energies less than 1 keV. However, this assumption contradicts with available information about cross sections. Here we analyze the forming of the hydrogen Doppler profile by detailing individual scattering reactions and electronic states. Theoretical estimations are tested by {{a new version of}} a transport code modeling penetration of the proton-hydrogen atom flux in the Earth’s atmosphere.

For ionic conductivity- and ITC-measurements we additionally used crystals with low doping concentrations to check our methods; the resulting values for activation enthalpies were in good accordance {{with those in the}} literature. From the ionic conductivity- and ITC-measurements we conclude that the precipitated particles in the heavily doped crystals may inject Ag+-vacancies into the matrix thus ionizing themselves. In this way, the particles act as sinks or traps for Ag+-vacancies. From small angle X-ray measurements, confirmed by light scattering experiments a model is deduced for the mechanism of precipitation in the supersaturated crystal.

40|$|A {{model of}} the {{precipitation}} process in reverse micelles has been developed to calculate the size of fine particles obtained therein. While the method shares several features of particle nucleation and growth common to precipitation in large systems, complexities arise in describing the processes of nucleation, due to the extremely small size of a micelle and of particle growth caused by fusion among the micelles. Occupancy of micelles by solubilized molecules is governed by Poisson statistics, implying {{most of them are}} empty and cannot nucleate of its own. The model therefore specifies the minimum number of solubilized molecules required to form a nucleus which is used to calculate the homogeneous nucleation rate. Simultaneously, interaction between micelles is assumed to occur by Brownian collision and instantaneous fusion. Analysis of time scales of various events shows growth of particles to be very fast compared to other phenomena occurring. This implies that nonempty micelles either are supersaturated or contain a single <b>precipitated</b> <b>particle</b> and allows application of deterministic population balance equations to describe the evolution of the system with time.

These lattice distortions result when the <b>precipitate</b> <b>particles</b> differ {{in size and}} crystallographic structure from the host atoms. Smaller <b>precipitate</b> <b>particles</b> in a host lattice leads to a tensile stress, whereas larger <b>precipitate</b> <b>particles</b> leads to a compressive stress. Dislocation defects also create a stress field. Above the dislocation there is a compressive stress and below there is a tensile stress. Consequently, there is a negative interaction energy between a dislocation and a precipitate that each respectively cause a compressive and a tensile stress or vice versa. In other words, the dislocation will be attracted to the precipitate. In addition, {{there is a positive}} interaction energy between a dislocation and a precipitate that have the same type of stress field.

Zirconyl chloride solutions at industrially relevant concentrations of 0. 81 and 1. 62 M were studied by small angle X-ray scattering, and the particle radii {{were found to be}} unchanged within experimental error. Yttrium–zirconium mixed solutions relevant to the Solid Oxide Fuel Cell market (containing 3, 5, 8 and 10 mole% yttrium) were also investigated, and {{it was found that the}} added yttrium did not significantly change the particle radii or particle-particle distances. Solutions at the same concentrations were then precipitated using a continuous double jet precipitation apparatus with aqueous ammonia as the base. Using DLS it was found that the zirconyl chloride solution at higher concentration yielded a larger <b>precipitated</b> <b>particle</b> size (1. 0 ± 0. 1 μm, 4. 2 ± 0. 1 μm).

To investigate if the growth effect was most influenced by the cations or the increasing chloride concentrations, sample solutions containing mixtures of caesium chloride/zirconyl chloride and calcium chloride/zirconyl chloride with the same concentration of added chloride anions as that of the 8 mole% yttrium–zirconium sample were precipitated.

40|$|Laser Shock Peening (LSP) {{has been}} {{successfully}} used to improve component fatigue performance by bringing beneficial compressive residual stress to material surface since the 1990 s. However, {{it has been found}} that the compressive residual stress generated by room temperature LSP (RT-LSP) is not stable during cyclic loading. Thus, it is necessary to improve the stability of the compressive residual stress generated by RT-LSP. ^ In this study, Warm Laser Shock Peening (WLSP) is proposed as a potential approach to improve the stability of the compressive residual stress. WLSP is to laser peen a component that is being heated to elevated temperatures. As a thermomechanical treatment (TMT) technique, WLSP integrates the advantages of LSP, dynamic strain aging (DSA) and dynamic precipitation (DP). Through DSA, more uniform and high density dislocations are generated. Through DP, highly dense nanoscale precipitates are generated. Experimentally, WLSP has been evaluated by AISI 4140 steel in terms of the microstructure, residual stress stability and fatigue performance. To investigate the effect of the <b>precipitate</b> <b>particles</b> generated by WLSP to crack propagation, an extended finite element method (XFEM) model was employed. To investigate the effect of temperature to the residual stress distribution, WLSP simulation of copper, a pure metal not applicable to dynamic strain aging, was carried out by finite element model (FEM) and validated by experiments. ^ Through these studies, it has been found that: (1) WLSP can generate high density nanoscale <b>precipitate</b> <b>particles</b> in alloy materials applicable to dynamic strain aging and precipitate hardening; (2) the highly dense <b>precipitate</b> <b>particles</b> generated by WLSP leads to higher material strength than RT-LSP; (3) the pinning force exerted by the <b>precipitate</b> <b>particles</b> to the dislocations leads to higher stability of the compressive residual stress; (4) the highly dense nanoscale <b>precipitate</b> <b>particles</b> generated by WLSP can dissipate the stress concentration near the crack tip and thus decrease the crack propagation speed and improve component fatigue performance. ...|$|R
