30|$|For {{regulatory}} testing, {{the decision}} on waiving of testing can be proposed by the registrant {{and has to be}} justified. The final decision on acceptance of the waiving is decided by the regulatory body. For chemical substances under REACH information requirement is triggered by their <b>production</b> <b>volume.</b> Four different ranges of <b>production</b> <b>volumes</b> per year are agreed on for which ecotoxicity data are required: 1 to < 10 t/a; 10 to < 100 t/a; 100 to < 1000 t/a; 1000 t/a and more). Chemicals with a high <b>production</b> <b>volume</b> have to be tested more comprehensively than chemicals with a lower <b>production</b> <b>volume.</b> For chemicals with low <b>production</b> <b>volumes,</b> only aquatic tests are requested whereas for chemicals with high <b>production</b> <b>volume</b> additionally terrestrial and sediment tests are required. In the presented test strategy for ENMs, only one threshold value based on one, rather low <b>production</b> <b>volume</b> is intended. This value still has to be defined. ENMs with <b>production</b> <b>volumes</b> exceeding this threshold value have to be comprehensively tested addressing endpoints in the three compartments: water, sediment and soil. Also ENMs with a lower <b>production</b> <b>volume</b> than the threshold can be toxic to the environment. Therefore, two scenarios have to be considered. For low volume ENMs with bulk material of known ecotoxicity, comprehensive investigation has to be performed. For low volume ENMs where no bulk material is available, the bulk material shows no ecotoxicity, or ecotoxicity of the ENMs is expected due to their physico-chemical properties, a screening test has to be performed. If toxic effects are detected in the screening test, comprehensive testing has to be performed.|$|R

40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} the {{mathematical}} logic behind a hierarchical planning procedure is discussed. The planning procedure {{is used to}} derive <b>production</b> <b>volumes</b> of consumer products. The essence of the planning procedure is that first a commitment is made concerning the <b>production</b> <b>volume</b> {{for a family of}} similar products and in a second stage the committed <b>production</b> <b>volume</b> is allocated among the products within the product family. A computationally attractive procedure is developed to compute the aggregate <b>production</b> <b>volume</b> and the allocated quantities, such that some target customer service level is achieved. The procedure is based on a combination of exact reasoning, approximation schemes and empirical findings. Numerical results showing the excellent performance of the procedure are included...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Decision making under {{risk and}} {{decision}} making under uncertainty are applied to cellular manufacturing specifically in machine cell formation step. The application works with part demand which can be either expressed in a probability distribution (probab listic <b>production</b> <b>volume)</b> or can not expressed in probability distribution, where only the different possible values for volume that can occur are known (uncertain <b>production</b> <b>volume).</b> Decision making under risk is used to help the designer select the best cell arrangement in case of prob bilistic <b>production</b> <b>volume</b> whereas decision making under uncertainty is used to help the designer select the best cell arrangement in case of uncertain <b>production</b> <b>volume.</b> The objective of the design methodology has been to maximize the profit, imposed by the resource capacities constraints...|$|R
50|$|We {{note that}} the {{productivity}} model reports a 1.4% productivity growth from the same production data. The difference (1.4% versus 1.5%) {{is caused by the}} different <b>production</b> <b>volume</b> used in the models. In the productivity model the input volume is used as a <b>production</b> <b>volume</b> measure giving the growth rate 1.063. In this case productivity is defined as follows: output volume per one unit of input volume. In the growth accounting model the output volume is used as a <b>production</b> <b>volume</b> measure giving the growth rate 1.078. In this case productivity is defined as follows: input consumption per one unit of output volume. The case can be verified easily with the aid of productivity model using output as a <b>production</b> <b>volume.</b>|$|R

40|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} {{has been}} widely used for wastewater treatment for decades. Several Anaerobic Toxicity tests {{have been developed to}} screen wastewater for toxicity and assess the treatability of such toxicants. However, past research and reviews on Biochemical Methane Potential (BMP) test and Anaerobic Toxicity Assay (ATA) were considered in this study. The experimental tests included ammonium-nitrogen and sodium chloride toxicity tests with varied concentration and solid retention time. These tests were designed to demonstrate the impact of ammonia- nitrogen and sodium chloride on the biological degradation process. The anaerobic test set-up includes bench-scale test reactors and respirometers used for measuring gas <b>production</b> <b>volume</b> and rate. The experimental data using the gas <b>production</b> <b>volumes</b> and rates were plotted and analyzed. The hourly rate of gas production significantly decreases before the daily <b>production</b> <b>volume</b> decreases. Also, the gas <b>production</b> <b>volume</b> curves showed little or no toxicity when the gas production rates showed toxicity and acclimation. In conclusion, the hourly production rate curves will indicate toxicity faster and extensively than the cumulative daily <b>production</b> <b>volume</b> curves, thereby reducing testing time...|$|R
