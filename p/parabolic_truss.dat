50|$|The Douglas & Jarvis Patent <b>Parabolic</b> <b>Truss</b> Iron Bridge is a {{historic}} bridge across the Missisquoi River in Highgate, Vermont. Located {{at the end of}} Mill Hill Road, it is at 215 ft one of the longest bridges of its type in the northeastern United States. It was built in 1887, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is the {{conversion}} and alternative proposal to the existing steel structure roofing the winter stadium in Jindrichuv Hradec. The building has a rectangular plan with dimensions of 80 x 52 m. The roof structure consists of lattice trusses and purlins, plotted using lattice steel columns. The other possibilities are <b>parabolic</b> lattice <b>trusses</b> and purlin with fly bracing that were designed and evaluated in accordance with applicable standards. The solution using <b>parabolic</b> <b>trusses</b> is designed on the original footprint of the structure. The distance of each bond is 8 m...|$|R
40|$|Bachelor thesis {{deals with}} the roof structure, its static {{assessment}} and analysis phases of construction. It is a roofing tennis hall <b>parabolic</b> <b>trusses,</b> which are formed from steel. In the hall there are three tennis courts and space for an auditorium for spectators. The entire structure and calculations are processed in a static software RFEM by the Dlubal. Only the load cases are calculated manually...|$|R
50|$|The {{reasons for}} the use of this design at Hadley are not recorded, but it is likely due to a problem with truss bridges which the design and setting could address. The longer the truss bridge, the deeper the truss itself is {{required}} to be, often with lateral bracing to prevent buckling. A medium-length span such as Hadley's is particularly problematic because while it may require bracing as well, the clearance below may not be adequate enough for it to be included. In Hadley's case the bridge is high enough that the <b>parabolic</b> <b>trusses</b> may well have been the least expensive solution.|$|R
50|$|The Douglas & Jarvis Patent <b>Parabolic</b> <b>Truss</b> Iron Bridge stands {{south of}} Highgate Falls village, {{at the end}} of Mill Hill Road, where it {{formerly}} crossed the Missisquoi River to meet Highgate Road (Vermont Route 207). The bridge is oriented east-west across the river, just downstream (north of) the dam at Highgate Falls, and is open to pedestrian use. It is 215 ft long and is set on stone abutments. It is of a parabolic or lenticular truss design, with a secondary lenticular pony truss span at its southern end. The main trusses are supported by iron I-beam portal posts topped by decorative finials, and are joined to each other by a web of overhead iron rods.|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{research}} is to assemble numerical tools that allows realistic dynamic study of structures under wind loading. The availability of such numerical tools is becoming more important for the industry, following previous experiences in structural damages after extreme wind events. The methodology of the present study involves two main steps: (i) preparing the wind loading according to its spatial and temporal correlations by using digitally generated wind or real measured wind; (ii) preparing the numerical model that captures the characteristics of the real structures and respects all the necessary numerical requirements to pursue transient dynamic analyses. The thesis is presented as an ensemble of four articles written for refereed journals and conferences that showcase the contributions of the present study to the advancement of transient dynamic study of structures under wind loading, on the wind model itself (the first article) and on the application of the wind study on complex structures (the next three articles). The articles presented are as follows: (a) the evaluation of three-dimensional correlations of wind, an important issue for more precise prediction of wind loading for flexible and line-like structures, the results presented in this first article helps design engineers to choose a more suitable models to define three-dimensional wind loading; (b) the refinement of design for solar photovoltaic concentrator-tracker structure developed for utility scale, this study addressed concerns related strict operational criteria and fatigue under wind load for a large <b>parabolic</b> <b>truss</b> structure; (c) the study of guyed towers for TLs, the applicability of the static-equivalent method from the current industry documents for the design of this type of flexible TL support was questioned, a simplified method to improve the wind design was proposed; (d) the fundamental issue of nonlinear behaviour under extreme wind loading for single-degree-of-freedom systems is evaluated here, the use of real measured hurricane and winter storm have highlighted the possible interest of taking into account the ductility in the extreme wind loading design. The present research project has shown the versatility of the use of the developed wind study methodology to solve concerns related to different type of complex structures. In addition, this study proposes simplified methods that are useful for practical engineers when there is the need to solve similar problems...|$|E

5000|$|A bridge near Krasnoyarsk {{carries the}} Trans-Siberian Railway across the Yenisei. This structure, {{one of the}} longest at the time, was {{constructed}} between 1893 and 1896 to an award-winning design by Lavr Proskuryakov. When approved for the inscription on the World Heritage List in 2003, the bridge was described by the UNESCO as [...] "an early representation of a typical <b>parabolic</b> polygonal <b>truss</b> bridge in Russia" [...] which became [...] "a testing ground for the application of engineering theories and the development of new innovative solutions, which had numerous successors" [...] (http://whc.unesco.org/p_dynamic/document/document_download.cfm?id_document=1441).|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} procedure {{for analysis of}} shadowed space heating of sparse structures, SSQ, is discussed. The SSQ program avoids inordinate computational complexity by confining attention to a single elemental location on a structural member of interest throughout an entire orbital period, proceeding then to similar treatment of individual alternate locations. The procedure considers a spacecraft in circular orbit and assumes fixed-Earth orientation of the spacecraft. Shadow orientation and interval duration, merged shadows, and computation of solar heat flux and thermal response are addressed. The output options of the SSQ FORTRAN 5 program and its efficiency are discussed. Application of the system {{to the analysis of}} a <b>parabolic</b> expandable <b>truss</b> antenna is considered...|$|R

The assessment of state-of-the-art deployable antenna technology is discussed, and the approach taken by the NASA Large Space Systems Technology (LSST) Program to the development of technology for large space antenna systems is outlined. Finally, the further development of the wrap-rib antenna and the maypole (hoop/column) concept, which meet mission model requirements, to satisfy LSST size and frequency requirements is discussed...|$|R
50|$|The {{design was}} {{conceived}} by Frederick Furkert, the inspecting engineer of the Public Works Department, {{and is a}} <b>parabolic</b> rib arch <b>truss</b> design. This was the second bridge of this type in New Zealand, the first being the Grafton Bridge in Auckland. It was built from concrete and steel between 1 November 1917 and 13 February 1919 by Steve Aburn and cost over £8,000. In April 2016, the rock wall of the bridge {{was struck by a}} driver who lost control while braking, causing significant damage.|$|R
5000|$|The {{majority}} (eighty eight) of {{the bridges}} were of plate girder construction with usually three plate sides (one central) supporting cross-beams {{on which the}} track was supported. For longer spans a girder [...] "N" [...] truss design was used These larger bridges incorporate rollers on one end {{to allow for the}} thermal expansion of the bridge. For other long spans, and for the two swing bridges on the line (Ouse and Hull bridges), open girder <b>truss</b> of approximately <b>parabolic</b> shape (open <b>truss</b> bowstring) were used. Both swing bridges were manufactured by Messrs. Handyside of Derby.|$|R
50|$|The Quechee Gorge Bridge {{is located}} on US 4, roughly midway between Woodstock and White River Junction, Vermont. It is set high above the Ottauquechee River near the {{southern}} end of Quechee Gorge, a major local tourist attraction that is part of Quechee State Park. It is a three-span steel deck truss structure, 285 ft long, 41 ft wide, and 163 ft high carrying two lanes of traffic (one in each direction) and sidewalks on both sides. Its main span is a <b>parabolic</b> spandrel-braced Pratt <b>truss,</b> forming a span of 188 ft. The arch is mounted on concrete footings, which are located near the stone abutments of the previous bridge. The bridge structure is built out of a series of panels and other steel elements, joined by rivets, and its deck consists of I-beam stringers covered by a concrete base.|$|R
