5|$|Despite these successes, {{the number}} of {{innovations}} introduced {{at the same time}} made the class unreliable and difficult to maintain. A great deal of money was wasted on resolving the <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> class designed for duties that could have been undertaken by cheaper 2-6-2 or 4-6-0 mixed-traffic locomotives. Likewise, more Light Pacifics were built than were needed, frequently undertaking tasks that would usually befit a much smaller locomotive. A curious but common sight west of Exeter during the winter months was a Light Pacific hauling a local stopping service with a single carriage to destinations as diverse as Padstow and Wadebridge. Finally, too much money was spent on the expensive rebuilding programme when dieselisation and modernisation meant the locomotives would have very limited lives in their new guise.|$|E

30|$|By {{means of}} the Green function, the {{boundary}} value <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fractional differential equation {{can be reduced to}} the equivalent integral equation. Recently, this method has been used successfully to discuss the existence of the solution to the boundary value <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nonlinear fractional differential equation. By applying the nonlinear alternative of the Leray-Schauder type and the Krasnoselskii fixed point theorem, we investigate the boundary value <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nonlinear impulsive fractional differential equation, and we obtain two existence results for the solution.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to reduce the {{eigenvalue}} <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> diagonalizable matrix to the eigenvalue <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> equivalent normal matrix.

25|$|The {{problems}} with the Chinese were never satisfactorily resolved. However, after the dissolution of ABDA, India retained control of operations in Burma until the formation of South East Asia Command in late 1943.

A skeleton force known as Burcorps was formed under Lieutenant General Sir William Slim, later to gain fame as {{the commander of the}} Fourteenth Army.|$|E

He examined the different processes by which they were obtaining isotopes. By {{the end of the summer}} in 1940, Peierls preferred gaseous diffusion to thermal diffusion.|$|E

25|$|PD {{is often}} {{characterized}} by a difficulty in regulating and controlling one’s stream of thought, and how memories are utilized in guiding future behaviour. Also, persons affected by PD often demonstrate perseverative behaviours such as continuing to pursue a goal after it is completed, or an inability to adopt a new strategy {{that may be more}} appropriate in achieving a goal. However, some recent research suggests that PD patients may actually be less persistent in pursuing goals than typical persons and may abandon tasks sooner when they encounter <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> higher level of difficulty.|$|E
25|$|Darrow {{opened his}} first little law office in Andover, Ohio, a small farming town just ten miles from Kinsman. Having {{little to no}} experience, he started off slowly and {{gradually}} built up his career by dealing with the everyday complaints and <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> farming community. After two years Darrow felt {{he was ready to}} take on new and different cases and moved his practice to Ashtabula, Ohio, which had a population of 5,000 people and was the largest city in the county. There he became involved in Democratic Party politics and served as the town counsel.|$|E
25|$|In {{the postwar}} years, {{she became a}} famous public figure, {{crippled}} by arthritis and cared for by Goudeket who supervised the preparation of her collected works, or Oeuvres completes (1948–1950). She continued to write during these years, bringing out L'Etoile vesper (1944) and Le fanal bleu (1949), in which she reflected on the <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> writer whose inspiration is primarily autobiographical. On her death on August 3, 1954, she was refused a religious funeral by the Catholic Church on account of her divorces, but was given a state funeral, the first French woman of letters to be granted this honour, and interred in Père-Lachaise cemetery.|$|E

25|$|Already an {{established}} writer (The Vagabond had received three {{votes for the}} prestigious Prix Goncourt), the decades of the 1920s and 1930s were Colette's most productive and innovative period. Set mostly in Burgundy or Paris during the Belle Époque, her work treated married life, sexuality, and the <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> woman's struggle for independence. It was frequently quasi-autobiographical: Chéri (1920) and Le Blé en herbe (1923) both deal with love between an aging woman and a very young man, a situation reflecting her relationship with Bertrand de Jouvenel and even Goudeket, who was sixteen years her junior. La Naissance du Jour (1928) is her explicit criticism of the conventional lives of women, expressed in a meditation on age and the renunciation of love through the character of her mother, Sido.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{relatively}} limited developments in recent empirical research, theoretical debates in sociology of law {{have been important}} in British literature during recent decades, with contributions from David Nelken exploring the <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> comparative sociology of law and {{the potential of the}} idea of legal cultures, Roger Cotterrell seeking to develop a new view of the relations of law and community to replace what he sees as outdated 'law and society' paradigms, and other scholars, such as David Schiff and Richard Nobles, examining the potential of Luhmannian systems theory {{and the extent to which}} law can be seen as an autonomous social field rather than as intimately interrelated with other aspects of the social. Also significant has been the burgeoning field of socio-legal research on regulation and government, to which British scholars have been prominent contributors.|$|E
25|$|The {{fourth and}} final season begins five months after Marissa's death in the car accident. Ryan starts the season in {{isolation}} as a broken, grieving man, seeking revenge on Volchok. With the help of Julie, both she and Ryan are able to track Volchok down in Mexico, and turn him into federal officials. The continued love of the Cohen family and {{the company of the}} eccentric Taylor Townsend guide him back to the light. Meanwhile, Seth and Summer face the <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> long distance relationship as Summer leaves to attend college. The first half of the season focuses on the characters accepting the reality of Marissa's death. The second half focuses on the characters 'finding themselves' while facing a myriad of identity crises. This final season contains multiple surprises, such as a new addition to the Cohen family, a visit to an alternate universe in which Sandy becomes mayor, and a natural disaster that leaves Newport devastated.|$|E

25|$|Similar to the <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{restricted}} educational background, {{the subjects}} of the first studies on the social sharing of emotions were limited to Belgian and French populations. While later studies conducted in Netherlands, Italy, and Spain produced similar results to the first studies, {{the question of whether}} social sharing exists in non-Western cultures. The first intercultural study compared Dutch subjects to Turkish and Surinamese immigrants, and the findings showed that social sharing was a prominent behavior in each group, although slightly less so for the Surinamese subjects. Other studies comparing Western and Eastern cultures produced similar results, finding that Eastern cultures had slightly lower rates of social sharing. Furthermore, several general qualitative differences were found between Western and Eastern populations. On average, Western subjects shared an emotional event more often (5–6 times) than Asian subjects (2–3 times). There was also a longer delay between the emotional event and the social sharing for Asian groups than for Western ones.|$|E
25|$|Throughout Lullaby, Streator is the reader's only narrator. True to his {{journalist}} occupation, he is {{detailed in}} many of his descriptions of the events going on around him. At the same time, Streator tends to be philosophical and cynical about {{the world around him}} and the people he meets, probably because of the tragedies that have haunted him for many years. In regards to the actual sequence and happenings of events, he seems to be a reliable narrator. But often his philosophical asides seem to overshadow his duty as a balanced narrator. At times, it is frustrating not knowing the true motives of Helen, Mona, or Oyster and, by the end, it is apparent that Streator could not always be trusted. But the nature of the story insists that we only get one perspective; one man retelling the past that has resulted in the present. Streator himself knows the issues with how he is telling the story, but in his recognition of the potential <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> first person perspective, he becomes a more reliable narrator.|$|E
500|$|Disraeli wrote {{two novels}} in the {{aftermath}} of the tour. Contarini Fleming (1832) was avowedly a self-portrait. It is subtitled [...] "a psychological autobiography", and depicts the conflicting elements of its hero's character: the duality of northern and Mediterranean ancestry, the dreaming artist and the bold man of action. As Parry observes, the book ends on a political note, setting out Europe's progress [...] "from feudal to federal principles". The Wondrous Tale of Alroy the following year portrayed the <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> medieval Jew in deciding between a small, exclusively Jewish state and a large empire embracing all.|$|E

500|$|Adler {{managed to}} {{leverage}} a recommendation from Prince Meshersky and another from Avrom Markovich Brodsky—a businessman so successful {{as to have}} earned the nickname [...] "the Jewish Tsar"—to get {{a job as a}} marketplace inspector for the Department of Weights and Measures, rather unusual for a Jew at that time. His mildly corrupt tenure there gave him good contacts with the police. These would soon come in handy for smoothing over certain <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> young and unlicensed theater troupe when Rosenberg and Spivakofsky returned from Romania, penniless because {{the end of the war}} had meant the collapse of Yiddish theater in the provinces, and ready to start a troupe in Odessa.|$|E
500|$|Kubrick {{credited}} {{the ease}} with which he photographed scenes to his early years as a photographer. He rarely added camera instructions in the script, preferring to handle that after a scene is created, as the visual part of film-making came easiest to him. Even in deciding which props and settings would be used, Kubrick paid meticulous attention to detail and tried to collect as much background material as possible, functioning rather like what he described as [...] "a detective". Cinematographer John Alcott, who worked closely with Kubrick on four of his films, and won an Oscar for Best Cinematography on Barry Lyndon, remarked that Kubrick [...] "questions everything", and was involved in the technical aspects of film-making including camera placement, scene composition, choice of lens, and even operating the camera which would usually be left to the cinematographer. Alcott considered Kubrick to be the [...] "nearest thing to genius I've ever worked with, with all the <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> genius".|$|E
500|$|The novelist Evelyn Waugh {{had been}} {{familiar}} with the Diary since his childhood. It was a great favourite of his parents—Arthur Waugh used to read passages aloud to his family, and Evelyn's biographer Selena Hastings has drawn attention to the distinctly Pooterish elements in the Waugh household. Evelyn Waugh was initially contemptuous of the book, but grew to admire it, {{to the extent of}} writing in his 1930 essay [...] "One Way to Immortality" [...] that it was [...] "the funniest book in the world". He added: [...] "Nobody wants to read other people's reflections on life and religion and politics, but the routine of their day, properly recorded, is always interesting, and will become more so as conditions change with the years". [...] Morton posits that several of the leading characters in Waugh's early novels, though socially far removed from the Pooters, share the bafflement of Charles and Carrie with the <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> changing world. In his 1945 novel Brideshead Revisited, Waugh has Lady Marchmain comforting her family by reading aloud from the Diary [...] "with her beautiful voice and great humour of expression". Morton suggests that one of the work's attractions to Waugh was his personal identification with Lupin, {{and the way in which}} the disapproved son (as Waugh saw himself) repeatedly manages to turn adverse circumstances to his ultimate advantage.|$|E
