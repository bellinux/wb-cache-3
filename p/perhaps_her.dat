5|$|In the {{wilderness}} {{of the dance}} floor, Gaga recognizes the wolf-woman she has become and refuses to misrepresent herself any longer. She notes that in the quiet of the night, despite falsehoods and tears, she can feel satisfaction by touching herself. By stroking herself and <b>perhaps</b> <b>her</b> metaphorical wolf-pelt, Gaga is engaging {{in a moment of}} self-acceptance and self-soothing. Lady Gaga realizes that {{it will be difficult to}} maintain her dualistic nature, and alludes to upcoming death when she tells audiences that she is so content that she would welcome death. These words appear to foreshadow the end of , as the singer alludes to a calm acceptance of her spiritual/ghostly side.|$|E
5|$|Benedicte Wrensted (1859–1949) was {{a notable}} Danish female photographer, who {{emigrated to the}} USA in 1894. Wrensted learned her craft from her {{maternal}} aunt, Charlotte Borgen, {{and for a time}} in the 1880s operated a studio on Torvet 8, in Horsens, Denmark. Much of her photographic career is anchored to her studio in Pocatello, a small town in southeastern Idaho, where she took photographs of the local inhabitants and recorded the growth of the town. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>her</b> most famous work remains her documentary photographs of the Shoshone Great Basin Native Americans which are considered of great anthropological importance. Wrensted became a U.S. citizen in 1912, at age 53, and in the same year ended her career as a photographer. Many of her Native American images are preserved at the Smithsonian Institution and National Archives.|$|E
25|$|If {{fertility}} is not {{the primary}} aim, then menstruation can usually be regulated with a contraceptive pill. The purpose of regulating menstruation, in essence, is for the woman's convenience, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>her</b> sense of well-being; there is no medical requirement for regular periods, {{as long as they}} occur sufficiently often.|$|E

25|$|HMS Talbot was a British Royal Navy 18-gun sloop-of-war {{built by}} James Heath & Sons, of East Teignmouth and {{launched}} in 1807. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>her</b> greatest accomplishment was {{the reversal of}} the liberation of Iceland that the colorful, erratic, former Royal Navy seaman and privateer Jørgen Jørgensen had carried out. Talbot was sold in 1815 for mercantile service.|$|E
25|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>her</b> last {{work as an}} {{individual}} was the writing and production of the film Bambule in 1970, where she put focus {{on a group of}} borstal girls in West Berlin; {{by the time it was}} scheduled to be aired, she had become wanted for the breakout of Andreas Baader, and its broadcast was delayed until 1994.|$|E
25|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>her</b> {{crowning}} achievement was that album's follow-up, When Fallen Angels Fly. That album won the Country Music Association's Album of the Year award {{and gave her}} four Top 10 singles. She followed it up with The Trouble with the Truth in 1996 which gave her Female Vocalist of the Year awards from both the Academy of Country Music and the Country Music Association.|$|E

25|$|She {{made her}} film {{debut in the}} 1944 musical comedy Up in Arms, co-starring Danny Kaye and Dinah Shore. This movie also {{happened}} to be Danny Kaye's own first film. This film was followed by Holiday in Mexico (1946), Green Dolphin Street (1947), and what was <b>perhaps</b> <b>her</b> best-known film, Tarzan and the Mermaids (1948). She {{was the subject of}} a well-known photograph published in the January 1, 1949, issue of Vogue.|$|E
25|$|Dee's last {{role in a}} theatrically {{released}} {{film was}} in the Eddie Murphy comedy A Thousand Words, in which she portrayed the mother of Murphy's protagonist. <b>Perhaps,</b> <b>her</b> penultimate film role is in 1982, which premiered at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival and was released on home video on March 1, 2016. It is unknown whether her final role will ever be seen, as King Dog was in production {{at the time of}} her death, and no release date has ever been announced.|$|E
25|$|In 1926, {{she sang}} on stage to Lecuona's piano in his 7th Concert of Cuban {{music at the}} Teatro Nacional. On {{vacation}} in New York she needed an appendix operation; after recovering she performed at a benefit concert for the blind. Then she auditioned for the Schubert brothers, impresarios, who offered her a contract. Significantly, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>her</b> husband returned to Cuba. She made her debut in the Schubert Follies together with Xavier Cugat at the Apollo Theater. Later she had a great hit with a review entitled A night in Spain.|$|E

25|$|House, <b>perhaps</b> <b>her</b> {{best known}} work, was a {{concrete}} {{cast of the}} inside of an entire Victorian terraced house completed in autumn 1993, exhibited {{at the location of}} the original house – 193 Grove Road – in East London (all the houses in the street had earlier been knocked down by the council). It drew mixed responses, winning her both the Turner Prize for best young British artist in 1993 and the K Foundation art award for worst British artist. She was the first woman to win a Turner Prize. Tower Hamlets London Borough Council demolished House on 11 January 1994, a decision which caused some controversy itself.|$|E
25|$|In 1944 she {{published}} {{what became}} <b>perhaps</b> <b>her</b> most famous work, Gigi, {{telling the story}} of sixteen year old Gilberte ("Gigi") Alvar. Born into a family of demimondaines, Gigi is being trained as a courtesan to captivate a wealthy lover, but breaks with tradition by marrying him instead. In 1949 it was made into a French film starring Danièle Delorme and Gaby Morlay, then in 1951 adapted for the stage with the then-unknown Audrey Hepburn in the title role, picked by Colette personally; the 1958 Hollywood musical, starring Leslie Caron and Louis Jourdan, with a screenplay by Alan Jay Lerner and a score by Lerner and Frederick Loewe, won the Academy Award for Best Picture.|$|E
25|$|Farren's Gaiety {{pieces in}} the 1880s {{included}} Lutz and Robert Reece's burlesques of The Forty Thieves (1880), as Ganem; the title roles in Aladdin (1881) and Little Robin Hood (1882); Ariel (1883, by F. C. Burnand, based on The Tempest); Blue Beard (1882); Camaralzaman and Mazeppa (1884); <b>perhaps</b> <b>her</b> most famous role as Little Jack Sheppard (1885); Richard Henry's Monte Cristo Jr., as Edmond Dantes (1886); Dr. Frankenstein in Frankenstein, or The Vampire's Victim (1887); Miss Esmeralda, or The Maid and the Monkey (1887); Fra Diavolo, Gulliver, Rip Van Winkle, Sonnambula; the title role in Cinder Ellen up too Late (1891); and dozens of others. Perhaps the most successful of her later roles was the title role in Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué (1889, by Fred Leslie and H. F. Clarke, a take-off of Victor Hugo's play Ruy Blas), which she and Fred Leslie toured in Australia (with Sidney Jones) and elsewhere in 1891. In 1888–89, she, Leslie, Letty Lind, Sylvia Grey, Marion Hood and the Gaiety company had toured the US and Australia with Monte Christo, Jr. and Miss Esmeralda.|$|E

25|$|From {{the mid-1960s}} onwards, {{she began to}} publish a series of volumes of Ananse stories, retold for children, which became widely known in Africa, England and America and {{throughout}} the English-speaking world. Beginning with Ananse the Spider: Tales from an Ashanti Village in 1966, and followed by Tales of an Ashanti Father, {{she went on to}} publish the Children of Ananse in 1968, The Pineapple Child and Other Tales from Asante in 1969, Why There are So Many Roads in 1972, and Why the Hyena Does Not Care for Fish and Other Tales from the Ashanti Gold Weights in 1977. She also published a series of readers to help Ghanaian children learn English: The Lost Earring, Yao and the Python, Abena and the Python, Afua and the Mouse and Kofi and the Crow, as well as a series of novels for children and adults, including Gift of the Mmoatia and Ring of Gold, and two volumes of poetry. Some of her works are used as set texts in primary and secondary schools in West Africa. <b>Perhaps,</b> <b>her</b> most important publication, however, which was the result of nearly five decades of work, was Bu Me Bé: Proverbs of the Akan, a collection of more than 7,000 Twi proverbs that was launched in Accra in 2001.|$|E
25|$|Sackville-West was {{a writer}} and author of novels. The Edwardians (1930) and All Passion Spent (1931) are <b>perhaps</b> <b>her</b> best-known novels today. In the latter, the elderly Lady Slane courageously embraces a long {{suppressed}} sense of freedom and whimsy {{after a lifetime of}} convention. This novel was dramatised by the BBC in 1986 starring Dame Wendy Hiller. All Passion Spent appears to reflect Woolf's influence, as Lady Slane, who has only existed while married to her late husband, a former prime minister, finally begins to live after his death, and becomes friends with the servants on her estate, discovering that the lives of people she had ignored until then are also interesting. At the end of the novel, Lady Slane persuades her granddaughter to break off an arranged marriage to pursue her career as a musician. Sackville-West took up writing again in 1930 after a six-year break {{for a variety of reasons}} as she needed money to pay for the Sissinghurst Castle which had just been purchased; Nicolson having left the Foreign Office no longer had a diplomat's salary to draw upon; she had to pay tuition for her two sons to attend Eton, one of the most expensive public schools in England; and it because she felt she had become a better writer thanks to the mentorship of Woolf who had taught her how to write better.|$|E
500|$|One of Molly's Mohawk names, <b>perhaps</b> <b>her</b> birth name, was Konwatsi'tsiaienni, {{which means}} [...] "Someone Lends Her a Flower". Her other Mohawk name, {{given to her}} at {{adulthood}} as was customary, was Degonwadonti, meaning [...] "Two Against One". Her Mohawk names have been spelled {{in a variety of}} ways in historical records.|$|E

500|$|To be a {{child of}} Kāli, Rāmprasād asserts, is to be denied of earthly delights and pleasures. Kāli is said to refrain from giving that which is expected. [...] To the devotee, it is <b>perhaps</b> <b>her</b> very refusal to do so that enables her devotees to reflect on {{dimensions}} of themselves and of reality that go beyond the material world.|$|E
500|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>her</b> best-known role {{to date is}} {{the part}} of human rebel Niobe in the films The Matrix Reloaded (2003) and The Matrix Revolutions (2003), sequels to 1999's The Matrix, and the related video game Enter The Matrix (2003). [...] The {{character}} was written specifically with Pinkett Smith in mind. Directly after she filmed her scenes for Ali, Pinkett Smith flew to Australia to work on the Matrix sequels. The sequels earned over $91 million and $48 million during opening weekends, respectively.|$|E
500|$|Marley Marl's first {{production}} was an [...] "answer record" [...] to [...] "Sucker MCs" [...] in 1983 entitled [...] "Sucker DJs" [...] by Dimples D. Soon after came 14-year-old Roxanne Shanté's answer to UTFO's [...] "Roxanne Roxanne", [...] "Roxanne's Revenge" [...] (1985), sparking off the huge wave of answer records {{known as the}} Roxanne Wars. More disses (insults intended to show disrespect) from Shanté followed: [...] "Bite This" [...] (1985), [...] "Queen of Rox" [...] (1985), introducing Biz Markie on [...] "Def Fresh Crew" [...] (1986), [...] "Payback" [...] (1987), and <b>perhaps</b> <b>her</b> greatest record, [...] "Have a Nice Day" [...] (1987).|$|E
60|$|It {{was curious}} how she seized the {{occasion}} to argue with some invisible opponent. <b>Perhaps</b> with <b>her</b> own better sense, always turning upon herself and her own deception.|$|R
