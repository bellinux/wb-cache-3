25|$|Recently, {{researchers}} have been locating tumors using arsenic-74 (a positron emitter). This isotope produces clearer <b>PET</b> <b>scan</b> images than the previous radioactive agent, iodine-124, because the body tends to transport iodine to the thyroid gland producing signal noise.|$|E
25|$|Using a <b>PET</b> <b>scan,</b> {{researchers}} found that activity in the left medial and lateral prefrontal cortex was reciprocally associated with decrease activity in the amygdala. These findings imply that the prefrontal cortex modulates the amygdala activity. The left prefronatal cortex {{plays a role in}} approach behaviors (positively valenced emotions), while the amygdala plays a role in withdrawal behaviors (negatively valenced emotions).|$|E
50|$|Two {{clinical}} trials were conducted for flutemetamol (18F). The first compared <b>PET</b> <b>scans</b> of {{terminally ill patients}} with flutemetamol to post mortem standard-of-truth assessments of cerebral cortical neuritic plaque density. The second trial assessed intra-reader reproducibility of <b>PET</b> <b>scans</b> using flutemetamol.|$|R
50|$|Positron {{emission}} tomography (PET) is another imaging technology that aids researchers. Instead of using magnetic resonance or X-rays, <b>PET</b> <b>scans</b> rely on positron emitting markers that {{are bound to}} a biologically relevant marker such as glucose. The more activation in the brain the more that region requires nutrients, so higher activation appears more brightly on {{an image of the}} brain. <b>PET</b> <b>scans</b> are becoming more frequently used by researchers because <b>PET</b> <b>scans</b> are activated due to metabolism whereas MRI is activated on a more physiological basis (sugar activation versus oxygen activation).|$|R
40|$|This {{activity}} {{is intended for}} radiologists, nuclear medicine specialists, and neurologists {{who are interested in}} improving the early diagnosis and clinical management of dementias such as Alzheimer's disease. Goal The objective of this {{activity is}} to spotlight the clinical utility of positron emission tomographic (<b>PET)</b> <b>scanning</b> in the early detection and clinical management of dementias such as Alzheimer's disease; to define appropriate settings for the use of this technology; and to offer a forum for a key opinion leader in nuclear medicine and emergent <b>PET</b> <b>scanning</b> applications to highlight the value of this technology for radiologists, nuclear medicine specialists, and neurologists who are members of the Medscape audience. Learning Objectives Upon completion of this activity, participants will be able to: 1. Describe how <b>PET</b> <b>scanning</b> can detect subtle metabolic changes in the brain associated with Alzheimer's disease prior to the onset of symptoms. 2. Detail how <b>PET</b> <b>scanning</b> can differentiate the metabolic signs of Alzheimer's disease from other dementias, such as Lewy body dementia. 3. Discuss ways in which <b>PET</b> <b>scanning</b> is more cost-effective than clinical evaluation alone in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. 4. Outline the role of <b>PET</b> <b>scanning</b> in the detection of metabolic changes in the brain linked to frontotemporal dementia. 5. Highlight the effectiveness of PET in delineating metabolic changes in the brain that may precede the development of Parkinson's disease...|$|R
25|$|While some imaging scans such as CT and MRI isolate organic {{anatomic}} {{changes in}} the body, PET and SPECT are capable of detecting areas of molecular biology detail (even prior to anatomic change). PET scanning does this using radiolabelled molecular probes that have different rates of uptake {{depending on the type}} and function of tissue involved. Changing of regional blood flow in various anatomic structures (as a measure of the injected positron emitter) can be visualized and relatively quantified with a <b>PET</b> <b>scan.</b>|$|E
25|$|Prostate {{cancer is}} another disease where carbon-11 choline PET imaging has found success. As with the brain, {{there is too}} much signal from the {{surrounding}} tissue, especially the bladder, to accurately measure tumor uptake with fluorine-18 FDG. While it was shown carbon-11 choline could be used to detect the initiation of prostate cancer, its value was found in detecting prostate cancer recurrence when it is the most deadly. In 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved carbon-11 choline as an imaging agent to be used during a <b>PET</b> <b>scan</b> to detect recurrent prostate cancer.|$|E
25|$|If the biologically active {{molecule}} {{chosen for}} PET is fludeoxyglucose (FDG), an analogue of glucose, {{the concentrations of}} tracer imaged will indicate tissue metabolic activity as it corresponds to the regional glucose uptake. Use of this tracer to explore the possibility of cancer metastasis (i.e., spreading to other sites) {{is the most common}} type of <b>PET</b> <b>scan</b> in standard medical care (90% of current scans). However, although on a minority basis, many other radioactive tracers are used in PET to image the tissue concentration of other types of molecules of interest. One of the disadvantages of PET scanners is their operating cost.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study is to give an {{overview}} of studies investigating the role of fludeoxyglucose F 18 ((18) F-FDG) positron emission tomography (<b>PET)</b> <b>scanning</b> in patients with aortic aneurysms with a focus on molecular characteristics of the aneurysm wall. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane database were searched for relevant articles. After inclusion and exclusion, we selected 18 relevant articles reporting on (18) F-FDG <b>PET</b> <b>scanning</b> of aortic aneurysms. RESULTS: The sample size of studies is limited, and there are no standardized imaging protocols and quantification methods. (18) F-FDG <b>PET</b> <b>scanning</b> was shown to display molecular characteristics of the aortic wall. Different studies showed contradictory findings of aortic (18) F-FDG uptake in aneurysm patients compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: Non-invasively determining molecular characteristics of aortic wall weakening might lead to better rupture and growth prediction. This might influence the decision of the surgeon between conservative and surgical treatment of aneurysms. To date, there is conflicted evidence regarding the use of (18) F-FDG <b>PET</b> <b>scanning</b> to predict aneurysm rupture and growth. The role of (18) F-FDG <b>PET</b> <b>scanning</b> in rupture risk prediction needs to be further investigated, and standardized imaging protocols and quantification methods need to be implemented...|$|R
25|$|<b>PET</b> <b>scanning</b> is non-invasive, {{but it does}} involve {{exposure}} to ionizing radiation.|$|R
50|$|Before {{the use of}} Functional {{magnetic}} resonance imaging became widespread, <b>PET</b> <b>scanning</b> was the preferred method of functional (as opposed to structural) brain imaging, and it still continues to make large contributions to neuroscience. <b>PET</b> <b>scanning</b> is also useful in PET-guided stereotactic surgery and radiosurgery for treatment of intracranial tumors, arteriovenous malformations and other surgically treatable conditions.|$|R
25|$|Although {{in theory}} all 18F-FDG is metabolized as above with a {{radioactivity}} elimination half-life of 110 minutes (the {{same as that}} of fluorine-18), clinical {{studies have shown that the}} radioactivity of 18F-FDG partitions into two major fractions. About 75% of the fluorine-18 activity remains in tissues and is eliminated with a half-life of 110 minutes, presumably by decaying in place to O-18 to form 18O-glucose-6-phosphate, which is non-radioactive (this molecule can soon be metabolized to carbon dioxide and water, after nuclear transmutation of the fluorine to oxygen ceases to prevent metabolism). Another fraction of 18F-FDG, representing about 20% of the total fluorine-18 activity of an injection, is eliminated renally by two hours after a dose of 18F-FDG, with a rapid half-life of about 16 minutes (this portion makes the renal-collecting system and bladder prominent in a normal <b>PET</b> <b>scan).</b> This short biological half-life indicates that this 20% portion of the total fluorine-18 tracer activity is eliminated pharmacokinetically (through the renal system) much more quickly than the isotope itself can decay. The rapidity also suggests that some of this 18F is no longer attached to glucose, since low concentrations of glucose in the blood are retained by the normal kidney and not passed into the urine. Because of this rapidly excreted urine 18F, the urine of a patient undergoing a <b>PET</b> <b>scan</b> may therefore be especially radioactive for several hours after administration of the isotope.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, a sixty-five-year-old {{advertising}} executive with no prior history of crime or violence after an argument strangled his wife, {{opened the window}} and threw her out of their 12th-floor apartment. His defense team had a structural brain scan done using MRI and <b>PET</b> <b>scan.</b> The images showed a big piece missing from the prefrontal cortex of the brain, i.e., a subarachnoid cyst was growing in his left frontal lobe. The defense team used these images to argue that Weinstein had an impaired ability to regulate his emotions and make rational decisions. The team went with an insanity defense, and the prosecution and defense agreed to a plea of manslaughter. As a result, Weinstein was given a seven-year sentence {{in contrast to the}} twenty-five-year sentence he would have served if he had been convicted of second-degree murder.|$|E
25|$|Gamma {{rays are}} also used for {{diagnostic}} purposes in nuclear medicine in imaging techniques. A number of different gamma-emitting radioisotopes are used. For example, in a <b>PET</b> <b>scan</b> a radiolabeled sugar called fludeoxyglucose emits positrons that are annihilated by electrons, producing pairs of gamma rays that highlight cancer as the cancer often has a higher metabolic rate than the surrounding tissues. The most common gamma emitter used in medical applications is the nuclear isomer technetium-99m which emits gamma rays in the same energy range as diagnostic X-rays. When this radionuclide tracer is administered to a patient, a gamma camera {{can be used to}} form an image of the radioisotope's distribution by detecting the gamma radiation emitted (see also SPECT). Depending on which molecule has been labeled with the tracer, such techniques can be employed to diagnose a wide range of conditions (for example, the spread of cancer to the bones via bone scan).|$|E

On June 26, 2008, Pausch indicated that he was considering stopping further chemotherapy because of the potential adverse side effects. He was, however, considering some immuno-therapy-based approaches.

500|$|Mulder sees Diabra, {{a diplomat}} from Burkina Faso. Diabra tells him an old folk {{tale of the}} Bambara people about the Teliko, which were nocturnal [...] "spirits of the air".

Aboah escapes the hospital and meets Duff in a car; he paralyses Duff {{in the same manner as}} his other victims and inserts a long metal object up his nose. A policeman finds Duff and requests an ambulance, and the police tell Mulder and Scully that they are sweeping the area for Aboah. Driving around, Mulder tells Scully that he thinks Aboah is the mythical Teliko. He stops at a demolition site, remembering that Pendrell found asbestos fibers on Sanders' body. Mulder and Scully split up at the site; Mulder is pierced as Kittel was and is taken into a duct by Aboah. Meanwhile, Scully, having heard Mulder's shouts for help, tracks him in the duct and is able to get him out of it, finding then the missing men dead, all of them with their skins depigmented. While calling for medical assistance by phone, Aboah is about to jump on her but Mulder's look alerts her and she quickly turns around and shoots at him. In her field journal, Scully writes that Aboah will stand trial if he lives long enough. She muses that Aboah's condition and survival may be discovered by science, but humans have a fear of an alien among them which causes them to [...] "deceive, inveigle, and obfuscate".|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} {{accuracy}} of 18 F-fluoro-L-dihydroxyphenylalanine ([18 F]-DOPA) <b>PET</b> <b>scans</b> to diagnose focal versus diffuse disease and to localize focal lesions in infants with congenital hyperinsulinism. STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-four infants with hyperinsulinism unresponsive to medical therapy were studied. Patients were injected intravenously with [18 F]-DOPA, and <b>PET</b> <b>scans</b> were obtained for 1 hour. Images were coregistered with abdominal CT scans. RESULTS: The diagnosis of focal or diffuse hyperinsulinism was correct in 23 of the 24 cases (96 %) and equivocal in 1 case. [18 F]-DOPA PET identified focal areas of high uptake of radiopharmaceutical in 11 patients.

2500|$|The {{amygdala}} plays a {{key role}} in emotional processing especially fear, and amygdala function appears to be emotionally lateralized. When people are shown fearful faces the left amygdala and left periamygdaloid cortex increase in activation.

Recordings from single-unit electrodes in monkeys have shown similar activation in the left amygdala. A man with confined damage in the right amygdala could not produce a startle response.
