5|$|Ward LeRoy Churchill (born 1947) is {{an author}} and {{political}} activist. He was a professor of ethnic studies at the University of Colorado Boulder from 1990 until 2007. The <b>primary</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> his work is on the historical treatment of political dissenters and Native Americans by the United States government. His work features controversial and provocative views, written in a direct, often confrontational style.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, {{construction}} resumed on roadways throughout Ontario. The expressway between Highland Creek and Oshawa {{was completed}} in December 1947, while other sections languished. The Toronto–Barrie Highway was the <b>primary</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> the Department of Highways at the time, and {{the onset of the}} Korean War in 1950 stalled construction again. Despite the delays, highway minister George Doucett officially announced the plans for construction of the new trans-provincial expressway that year, with the Toronto to Oshawa expressway serving {{as a model for the}} design. Work on the most important link, the Toronto Bypass, began in 1951, but it would not open with that name.|$|E

40|$|<b>Primary</b> <b>foci</b> <b>of</b> phytophthora. {{could be}} found in potato fields {{originating}} from diseased tubers and on refuse heaps. In De Streek (North Holland) the very susceptible variety Eersteling had I <b>primary</b> <b>focus</b> per 80 ha of potatoes. Infection from refuse heaps was there of minor importance. Only a small proportion of diseased tubers planted gave a <b>primary</b> <b>focus.</b> Spread from the <b>primary</b> <b>foci</b> was studied. Epidemics of phytophthora. under the prevailing weather conditions could be easily explained by spread from the <b>primary</b> <b>foci.</b> 'Field resistance' <b>of</b> the varieties plays a main role in epidemics. A method for testing it in the greenhouse was worked out. The disease could be controlled not only by spraying but also by careful inspection of seed potatoes and by eradication <b>of</b> <b>primary</b> <b>foci</b> in field and on refuse heaps. Heat treatment of tubers killed the fungus, but would hardly be applicable in practice. <p/...|$|R
5|$|For {{the first}} half of the 20th century, due to a {{widespread}} distrust of permanent military forces in Australia, the reserve military forces were the <b>primary</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> Australian military planning. Following the end of World War II, however, this focus gradually shifted due to the changing strategic environment, and the requirement for a higher readiness force available to support collective security goals. Since then, Australian defence policy has been focused more upon the Regular Army, and there has been considerable debate about the role of the Army Reserve within defence planning circles. As the strategic situation has evolved in the post Cold War era, the organisation, structure, training and role of the Army Reserve has undergone considerable changes, and members of the Army Reserve are increasingly being used on overseas deployments, not only within Regular Army units, but also in units drawn almost entirely from Reserve units.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{was also}} positively received; for example, Hendrix from GamePro shared his {{opinion that the}} game did well with management of the games time. Nelson and Hendrix from IGN and GamePro both emphasized their enjoyment of the games action elements. GameSpot, while feeling that the action elements were the <b>primary</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> the game, still liked {{the wide variety of}} role-playing elements present. Nelson from IGN, however, wished that the role-playing elements had been reduced even further in favor of the action parts of the game. All three reviewers compared the game to The Legend of Zelda, such as Mielke from GameSpot who had discussed the game to release as a direct competitor to that series. Both GameSpot and IGN felt that the comparison was invalid, as Musashi focused much more on action than role-playing, resulting in a game that was not a direct competitor at all.|$|E
5|$|The {{images and}} media reports of {{children}} dying terrorized many children who, {{as demonstrated by}} later research, showed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Children became a <b>primary</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> concern {{in the mental health}} response to bombing and many bomb related services were delivered to the community, young and old alike. These services were delivered to public schools of Oklahoma and reached approximately 40,000 students. One of the first organized mental health activities in Oklahoma City was a clinical study of {{middle and high school students}} conducted 7 weeks after the bombing. The study focused on middle and high school students that had no connection or relation to the victims of the bombing. This study showed that these students, although deeply moved by the event and showing a sense of vulnerability on the matter, had no difficulty with the demands of school or home life, contrasting those who were connected to the bombing and its victims, who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.|$|E

5|$|The <b>primary</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> {{the society}} {{at this time}} was simple subsistence. To {{continue}} as a group, they had to focus all of their energies on producing food. This was problematic {{because many of the}} members were becoming old and several suffered illnesses. Since the beginning, Beilhart and the other members had not actively sought out new members, believing that a small group was more viable. This proved to be their undoing as there were no younger members to sustain the farm. The original members, who had stayed with the group since its inception, began to leave and by 1928, only six were left. Financial strains forced them to relinquish the ranch and move to a house in the village of Soquel.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships were}} turned into {{floating}} AA batteries {{over the next}} several months although it availed them little when they were attacked again by American carrier aircraft in July. On the 24th Ise was struck by five bombs and near missed multiple times; all told she lost 50 crewmen killed and many others wounded. The bombs started numerous leaks and Ise began to settle by the bow, although she was returned to an even keel after three days pumping. Hyūga was a <b>primary</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> the attack and she received 10 direct hits and up to 30 near misses. She was badly damaged with some 200-odd crewmen killed and 600 wounded during the attack. She slowly foundered over the next two days and was not attacked when the Americans returned four days later. This time it was Ises turn and she was struck 11 or more times with many near misses that put her on the bottom in shallow water with a 15 degree list. The sisters were struck off the Navy List in November and their wrecks were scrapped after the war.|$|E

40|$|Ten new-born lambs were necropsied {{at various}} {{intervals}} after artificial infection with Rift Valley fever virus {{for the study}} of the sequential development of the hepatic lesions. During the late stage of the disease, the livers were slightly to moderately swollen and mottled yellow, orange-brown and red. Greyish-white foci, approximately 0, 25 - 0, 5 mm in diameter, were also scattered throughout the parenchyma. Microscopically, the liver lesions progressed from sparsely distributed acidophilic bodies and hepatocytes, revealing acidophilic degeneration and necrosis 6 - 12 h post-inoculation, to small randomly scattered <b>primary</b> <b>foci</b> <b>of</b> necrosis 12 - 24 h after infection. At 30 - 36 h, these <b>primary</b> <b>foci</b> were larger and more circumscribed. In addition, numerous acidophilic bodies and necrotic hepatocytes were dispersed throughout the markedly degenerated parenchyma. The terminal stage of the disease (48 - 53 h after inoculation), was characterized by massive hepatic necrosis in which <b>primary</b> <b>foci</b> <b>of</b> necrosis could still be recognized as dense aggregates of cytoplasmic and nuclear debris.

25|$|While some transhumanists take an {{abstract}} and theoretical {{approach to the}} perceived benefits of emerging technologies, others have offered specific proposals for modifications to the human body, including heritable ones. Transhumanists are often concerned with methods of enhancing the human nervous system.
