40|$|To {{investigate}} the possible mechanisms of high-altitude native animals in adapting to high altitude, we cloned hemoglobin alpha-chain (alpha-chain Hb) gene from <b>Pantholops</b> <b>hodgsonii,</b> an animal species that indigenously lives at elevations of 3700 - 5500 m on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau. Using reverse transcription {{polymerase chain reaction}} (RT-PCR) technique, the alpha-chain Hb gene was amplified from total RNA in the liver of the <b>Pantholops</b> <b>hodgsonii.</b> TA cloning technique was used and the PCR product was cloned into pGEM-T vector. The DNA sequence of the gene was highly homologous with sheep (99. 1 %), goat (98. 6 %), cattle (95. 6 %) and human (86. 5 %). The alpha-chain Hb gene encoded a 142 -amino acid protein that could be identified with the homology of alpha-chain Hb protein in sheep (98 %), goat (96 %), cattle (91 %) and human (87 %). However, 18 alternations were detected {{when compared with the}} alpha-chain Hb gene in human, and 2 in sheep. Moreover, the alterations of á 117 GluAsp and α 132 AsnSer in important regions were noted in human and sheep, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the structure of alpha-chain Hb was highly similar to that in sheep. This study provided essential information for elucidating the possible roles of hemoglobin in adapting to extremely high altitude in <b>Pantholops</b> <b>hodgsonii...</b>|$|R

[...] The area is also an important habitat for the endangered Kozlov's Pika, and the relatively common Ladak pika. [...] There are also small populations of dholes (Wild Asiatic dogs).|$|R
5000|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} saiga is Saiga tatarica. It is the sole extant member of its genus and is classified under the family Bovidae. This species was first described by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus in the 12th edition of Systema Naturae (1766). Linnaeus gave it the name Capra tatarica. The relation between the saiga and the Tibetan antelope (<b>Pantholops</b> <b>hodgsonii)</b> have long been debated. English zoologist Reginald Innes Pocock classified them under different subfamilies in 1910.|$|R
5000|$|The Tibetan {{antelope}} or chiru (<b>Pantholops</b> <b>hodgsonii)</b> ( [...] , pronounced [...] ) is {{a medium-sized}} bovid {{native to the}} Tibetan plateau. Fewer than 75,000 individuals are left in the wild. [...] In recent years, they have become endangered due to poaching. They are hunted for their soft and warm wool which is usually obtained after death. This wool is known as shahtoosh and is used to weave shawls [...] At present, international trade in their products is strictly prohibited.|$|R
50|$|Here {{are some}} of the last {{remaining}} herds of wild ungulates: wild yak (Bos grunniens), Tibetan wild ass or kiang (Equus kiang), Himalayan blue sheep or Bharal (Pseudois nayaur), Argali (Ovis ammon), Mongolian gazelle (Procapra gutturosa) and Tibetan antelope or chiru (<b>Pantholops</b> <b>hodgsonii).</b> Chiru wool is considered the finest known, and is smuggled, especially to Kashmir, India where it is woven into shahtoosh shawls. Predators include snow leopards (Panthera uncia or Uncia uncia), Tibetan wolves (Canis lupus chanco), Turkestan lynx (Lynx lynx isabellinus) and Tibetan blue bears (Ursus arctos pruinosus). At the bottom end of the food chain are large numbers of pika (Ochotona spp.).|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Land bridges once assured transcontinental connectivity, but climate-induced {{habitat loss}} {{resulted}} in the extinc-tion of numerous North American large mammals. Using GPS technology on the formerly widespread but now endan-gered saiga in Mongolia, we identified a fine-scaled 5 -km wide critical corridor, whose protection is critical for maintain-ing migration and meta-population structure. The world’s great overland migrations are disappearing, truncating fundamental processes that have contributed to ecosystem functioning for millennia. With more people reli-ant on lands that were once remote, intact habitats are now replaced by livestock, fences, and people [1]. Nevertheless, expansive grasslands and deserts in China, Mongolia, Ka-zakhstan, and Russia still sustain extraordinary movements between winter and summer ranges, including those of chiru (<b>Pantholops</b> <b>hodgsonii),</b> white-(Procapra gutturosa) and black-tailed (Gazella subgutturosa) gazelles, khulan (Equus hemionus), saiga (Saiga tatarica), and Bactrian camel...|$|R

He amassed a large collection of birds and mammal skins which he later donated to the British Museum. He described a species of antelope which was named after him, the Tibetan Antelope <b>Pantholops</b> <b>hodgsonii.</b> He also described the pygmy hog which he gave the scientific name of Porcula salvania, the species name derived from the Sal forest ("van" [...] in Sanskrit) habitat where it was found. He also discovered 39 species of mammals and 124 species of birds which had not been described previously, 79 of the bird species were described himself. The zoological collections presented to the British Museum by Hodgson in 1843 and 1858 contained 10,499 specimens. In addition to these, the collection also included {{an enormous number of}} drawings and coloured sketches of Indian animals by three native artists under his supervision. One of them was Raj Man Singh, but many of the paintings are unsigned. Most of them were subsequently transferred to the Zoological Society of London and the Natural History Museum.|$|R

50|$|Its closest living {{relative}} {{is probably}} the lappet-faced vulture, which takes live prey on occasion. Occasionally, the cinereous vulture has been recorded as preying on live prey as well. Live animals reportedly taken by cinereous vultures include calves of yak and domestic cattle (Bos primigenius taurus), piglets, domestic lambs and puppies (Canis lupus familiaris), fox, lambs of wild sheep, together with nestling and fledglings of large birds such as goose, swan and pheasant, various rodents and rarely amphibians and reptiles. This species has hunted tortoises, which the vultures are likely to kill by carrying in flight and dropping on rocks to penetrate the shell, and lizards. Although rarely observed {{in the act of}} killing ungulates, cinereous vultures have been recorded as flying low around herds and feeding on recently killed wild ungulates they are believed to have killed. Mainly neonatal lambs or calves are hunted, especially sickly ones. Although not normally thought to be a threat to healthy domestic lambs, rare predation on apparently healthy lambs has been confirmed. Species believed to be hunted by cinereous vultures have including argali, saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica), Mongolian gazelle (Procapra gutturosa) and Tibetan antelope (<b>Pantholops</b> <b>hodgsonii).</b>|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} genetic {{mechanisms of}} high altitude adaptations of native mammals on the Tibetan Plateau, we compared mitochondrial sequences {{of the endangered}} <b>Pantholops</b> <b>hodgsonii</b> with its lowland distant relatives Ovis aries and Capra hir-cus, {{as well as other}} mammals. The complete mitochondrial genome of P. hodgsonii (16, 498 bp) revealed a similar gene order as of other mammals. Because of tandem duplications, the control region of P. hodgsonii mitochondrial genome is shorter than those of O. aries and C. hircus, but longer than those of Bos species. Phy-logenetic analysis based on alignments of the entire cytochrome b genes suggested that P. hodgsonii is more closely related to O. aries and C. hircus, rather than to species of the Antilopinae subfamily. The estimated divergence time between P. hodgsonii and O. aries is about 2. 25 million years ago. Further analysis on natu-ral selection indicated that the COXI (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I) gene was under positive selection in P. hodgsonii and Bos grunniens. Considering the same climates and environments shared by these two mammalian species, we proposed that the mitochondrial COXI gene is probably relevant for these native mammals to adapt the high altitude environment unique to the Tibetan Plateau.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 110 (5), 1785 - 1790. One of {{the most}} difficult problems in modern genomics is the assembly of full-length chromosomes using next generation sequencing (NGS) data. To address this problem, we developed "reference-assisted chromosome assembly" (RACA), an algorithm to reliably order and orient sequence scaffolds generated by NGS and assemblers into longer chromosomal fragments using comparative genome information and paired-end reads. Evaluation of results using simulated and real genome assemblies indicates that our approach can substantially improve genomes generated by a wide variety of de novo assemblers if a good reference assembly of a closely related species and outgroup genomes are available. We used RACA to reconstruct 60 Tibetan antelope (<b>Pantholops</b> <b>hodgsonii)</b> chromosome fragments from 1, 434 SOAPdenovo sequence scaffolds, of which 16 chromosome fragments were homologous to complete cattle chromosomes. Experimental validation by PCR showed that predictions made by RACA are highly accurate. Our results indicate that RACA will significantly facilitate the study of chromosome evolution and genome rearrangements for the large number of genomes being sequenced by NGS that do not have a genetic or physical map.

40|$|Understanding how {{population}} density relates to habitat underlies basic ecological theory and is pertinent to conservation issues. Chiru (<b>Pantholops</b> <b>hodgsonii)</b> are an endangered steppe-dwelling ungulate endemic to the Tibetan plateau. To prepare effective {{conservation and management}} strategies for this species, we require detailed knowledge {{of the relationship between}} group size and habitat conditions. We surveyed the Chang Tang region of Tibet and used data collected along vehicular line transects to record the presence and group size of chiru. Using ecological niche factor analysis, we inferred the ecological requirements of chiru in relation to a large number of topographic, vegetation, and anthropogenic variables. We used these analyses to estimate habitat suitability models and describe their optimum range. Areas favored by chiru had moderate grazing by domestic animals, gentle slopes, and villages present only at lower altitudes. Chiru showed a high level of specialization regarding the presence of villages and gentle slopes, and were negatively associated with areas of those easily accessed by people. We suggest new management measures for the long-term conservation of chiru. Specifically, we focus on the rehabilitation of natural plains for grazing by chiru, recognizing that conservation of large groups may require special efforts. For smaller groups and solitary chiru, the large tracts of unsuitable or marginal areas may expose them to different threats that could pose greater challenges for conservation management.

40|$|The {{population}} of the Tibetan Antelope (<b>Pantholops</b> <b>hodgsonii)</b> has recently declined dramatically due to the illegal trade in its wool. The animal lives at high altitude and is protected from the extremely cold climate due to a coat of very fine wool. These hairs are highly sought for weaving a shawl called shahtoosh. The large-scale poaching of the antelope {{has resulted in the}} species being placed on CITES Appendix I. We report on a method of DNA profiling on a confiscated shahtoosh using the cytochrome b (cyt b) gene to produce a test that will identify unambiguously the presence of P. hodgsonii. Two shahtoosh samples were provided by the Council of Agriculture, Taiwan, and ten shawl samples of sheep wool (Ovis aries), cashmere from the Kashmir goat (Capra hircus), and pashmina from the Himalayan goat (C. hircus) were collected from local stores for comparison. Two primer pairs were used to amplify a 271 [*]bp fragment of cyt b gene which would distinguish these three species. The resulting amplification products were directly sequenced. When the DNA sequences were compared with the sequences registered in GenBank and EMBL databases, the sequences with the highest homology were the cyt b genes of P. hodgsonii, C. hircus, and O. aries. This study demonstrates that there is still sufficient DNA present in the finished wool of a shahtoosh shawl to allow DNA typing and the method established was highly plausible to identify the CITES protected species...|$|R
40|$|The {{extent to}} which a species {{responds}} to environmental changes is mediated not only by extrinsic processes such as time and space, but also by species-specific ecology. The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau uplifted approximately 3000 m and experienced at least four major glaciations during the Pleistocene epoch in the Quaternary Period. Consequently, the area experienced concurrent changes in geomorphological structure and climate. Two species, the Tibetan antelope (<b>Pantholops</b> <b>hodgsonii,</b> chiru) and Tibetan gazelle (Procapra picticaudata), both are endemic on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, where their habitats overlap, but have different migratory behaviors: the chiru is inclined to have female-biased dispersal with a breeding migration during the calving season; in contrast, Tibetan gazelles are year-round residents and never migrate distantly. By using coalescence methods we compared mitochondrial control region DNA sequences and variation at nine microsatellite loci in these two species. Coalescent simulations indicate that the chiru and Tibetan gazelle do not share concordant patterns in their genealogies. The non-migratory Tibetan gazelle, that is more vulnerable to the impact of drastic geographic changes such as the elevation of the plateau, glaciations and so on, appears to have a strong population genetic structure with complicated demographic history. Specifically, the Tibetan gazelle population appears to have experienced isolation and divergence with population fluctuations since the Middle Pleistocene (0. 781 Ma). However, it showed continued decline since the Upper Pleistocene (0. 126 Ma), which may be attributed to the irreversible impact o...|$|R
5000|$|The {{second part}} of a {{binomial}} may be a noun in the genitive (possessive) case. The genitive case is constructed {{in a number of}} ways in Latin, depending on the declension of the noun. Common endings for masculine and neuter nouns are -ii or -i in the singular and -orum in the plural, and for feminine nouns -ae in the singular and -arum in the plural. The noun may be part of a person's name, often the surname, as in the Tibetan antelope <b>Pantholops</b> <b>hodgsonii,</b> the shrub Magnolia hodgsonii, or the olive-backed pipit Anthus hodgsoni. The meaning is [...] "of the person named", so that Magnolia hodgsonii means [...] "Hodgson's magnolia". The -ii or -i endings show that in each case Hodgson was a man (not the same one); had Hodgson been a woman, hodgsonae would have been used. The person commemorated in the binomial name is not usually (if ever) the person who created the name; for example Anthus hodgsoni was named by Charles Wallace Richmond, in honour of Hodgson. Rather than a person, the noun may be related to a place, as with Latimeria chalumnae, meaning [...] "of the Chalumna River". Another use of genitive nouns is in, for example, the name of the bacterium Escherichia coli, where coli means [...] "of the colon". This formation is common in parasites, as in Xenos vesparum, where vesparum means [...] "of the wasps", since Xenos vesparum is a parasite of wasps.|$|R
30|$|The Tibetan Plateau covers {{one-quarter of}} China's land area. It is the highest, most {{extensive}} mountain {{region in the}} world and comprises the headwaters of Asia's major rivers (the Yellow, Yangtze, Mekong, Salween and Brahmaputra rivers). The Tibetan Plateau is therefore known as the ‘water tower of Asia’ as well as ‘the third pole’ of the world (Foggin 2005 a; Qiu 2008; Wang and Fu 2004; Yao et al. 2011). The traditional livelihood has been nomadic pastoralism, with seasonal movements between known pastures, and with societal structures (e.g. tribal and clan arrangements) that allowed for landscape-level natural resource management decisions (Foggin 2005 b; Goldstein and Beall 1990; Miller 2000; Sheehy et al. 2006). Management flexibility and other risk-averse responses, for example in the face of natural disasters, also developed within the pastoral system of resource use (Næss 2004; Xu et al. 2008). With extensive and remote grassland, wetland and mountain landscapes, this high-altitude region is home not only to Tibetan pastoralists and their livestock, but also to a wide array of rare and endangered mammals including the Tibetan wild yak (Bos grunniens), Tibetan antelope (<b>Pantholops</b> <b>hodgsonii),</b> white-lipped deer (Przewalskium albirostris), wild ass (Equus kiang), argali (Ovis ammon), blue sheep (Pseudois nayaur), snow leopard (Uncia uncia), Pallas' cat (Felis manul), Tibetan fox (Vulpes ferrilata), brown bear (Ursus arctos), etc. Endangered and endemic birds of the plateau include black-necked crane (Grus nigricollis), bar-headed goose (Anser indicus), golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), lammergeier (Gypaetus barbatus), saker falcon (Falco cherrug), blue eared pheasant (Crossoptilon auritum), Tibetan rosefinch (Carpodacus roborowskii) and others.|$|R
30|$|Over {{the course}} of the last five decades, {{pastoralist}} lifestyles around the world have been influenced by changes in socio-political circumstances leading to changes in pastoralist rangeland use practices (Behnke and Scoones 1993; Robinson and Milner-Gulland 2003; Namgail et al. 2007 a). Commonly observed impacts of such changes are reductions in pasture turnover, sedentarization of nomadic pastoralists, increased livestock populations and conflicts with wildlife sharing similar resources. For instance, changes in government in the former Soviet Central Asian republics have been traumatic not only for the pastoralists but also for the pastures and wild herbivores such as the highly endangered saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica) (Milner-Gulland et al. 2001; Kerven 2003; Robinson and Milner-Gulland 2003). The curtailment of pastoralists’ movements after the end of the USSR, following the previous Soviet collectivization of livestock to increase the livestock production, ended in a near disaster, ecologically and economically for Central Asia rangelands (Ellis and Lee 2003; Kerven 2003). Similarly, official pasture use policies in Chinese Tibet have seen dramatic changes in the recent past, with the fencing of winter pastures for livestock and changes in rangeland management goals, leading to sedentarization of pastoralists and endangering local flora and fauna, such as the emblematic migratory Tibetan antelope (<b>Pantholops</b> <b>hodgsonii)</b> and wild yak (Bos grunniens) (Bauer 2005; Xu et al. 2009; Fox et al. 2009). In parts of Central Asia and Himalaya, studies have demonstrated that intense livestock grazing may pose a serious threat to wildlife resulting in their decimation or even local extinction (Mishra et al. 2002, 2004; Bhatnagar et al. 2006 a).|$|R
40|$|Estimating the {{potential}} of species to cope with rapid environmental climatic modifications is of vital importance for determining their future viability and conservation. The variation between existing populations along a climatic gradient may predict how a species will respond to future climate change. Stipa purpurea is a dominant grass species in the alpine steppe and meadow of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). Ecological niche modelling was applied to S. purpurea, and its distribution {{was found to be}} most strongly correlated with the annual precipitation and the mean temperature of the warmest quarter. We established a north-to-south transect over 2000 km long on the QTP reflecting the gradients of temperature and precipitation, and then we estimated the morphological by sampling fruited tussocks and genetic divergence by using 11 microsatellite markers between 20 populations along the transect. Reproductive traits (the number of seeds and reproductive shoots), the reproductive-vegetative growth ratio and the length of roots in the S. purpurea populations varied significantly with climate variables. S. purpurea has high genetic diversity (He = 0. 585), a large effective population size (Ne > 1, 000), and a considerable level of gene flow between populations. The S. purpurea populations have a mosaic genetic structure: some distant populations (over 1000 km apart) clustered genetically, whereas closer populations (< 100 km apart) had diverged significantly, suggesting local adaptation. Asymmetrical long-distance inter-population gene flow occurs along the sampling transect and might be mediated by seed dispersal via migratory herbivores, such as the chiru (<b>Pantholops</b> <b>hodgsonii).</b> These findings suggest that population performance variation and gene flow both facilitate the response of S. purpurea to climate change...|$|R
40|$|Microsatellites {{or simple}} {{sequence}} repeats (SSRs) {{have become the}} most popular source of genetic markers, which are ubiquitously distributed in many eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes. This is the first study examining and comparing SSRs in completely sequenced genomes of the Bovidae. We analyzed and compared the number of SSRs, relative abundance, relative density, guanine-cytosine (GC) content and proportion of SSRs in six taxonomically different bovid species: Bos taurus, Bubalus bubalis, Bos mutus, Ovis aries, Capra hircus, and <b>Pantholops</b> <b>hodgsonii.</b> Our analysis revealed that, based on our search criteria, {{the total number of}} perfect SSRs found ranged from 663, 079 to 806, 907 and covered from 0. 44 % to 0. 48 % of the bovid genomes. Relative abundance and density of SSRs in these Bovinae genomes were non-significantly correlated with genome size (Pearson, r 0. 05). Perfect mononucleotide SSRs were the most abundant, followed by the pattern: perfect di- > tri- > penta- > tetra- > hexanucleotide SSRs. Generally, the number of SSRs, relative abundance, and relative density of SSRs decreased as the motif repeat length increased in each species of Bovidae. The most GC-content was in trinucleotide SSRs and the least was in the mononucleotide SSRs in the six bovid genomes. The GC-contents of tri- and pentanucleotide SSRs showed a great deal of similarity among different chromosomes of B. taurus, O. aries, and C. hircus. SSR number of all chromosomes in the B. taurus, O. aries, and C. hircus is closely positively correlated with chromosome sequence size (Pearson, r > 0. 980, p 0. 05). Relative abundances of the same nucleotide SSR type showed great similarity among different chromosomes of B. taurus, O. aries, and C. hircus...|$|R
