5000|$|On August 2, 1992, a {{heavy water}} leak at Pickering reactor 1 heat {{exchanger}} released 2.3 <b>petabecquerel</b> (PBq) of radioactive tritium into Lake Ontario, resulting in {{increased levels of}} tritium in drinking water along the lake shoreline; ...|$|E
5000|$|Like any SI unit, Bq can be prefixed; {{commonly}} used multiples are kBq (kilobecquerel, 103 Bq), MBq (megabecquerel, 106 Bq, equivalent to 1 rutherford), GBq (gigabecquerel, 109 Bq), TBq (terabecquerel, 1012 Bq), and PBq (<b>petabecquerel,</b> 1015 Bq). For practical applications, 1 Bq {{is a small}} unit; therefore, the prefixes are common. For example, the roughly 0.0169 g of potassium-40 present in a typical human body produces approximately 4,400 disintegrations per second or 4.4 kBq of activity. The global inventory of carbon-14 {{is estimated to be}} [...] (8.5 EBq, 8.5 exabecquerel). The nuclear explosion in Hiroshima (An explosion of [...] ) is estimated to have produced [...] (8 YBq, 8 yottabecquerel).|$|E
50|$|According to NISA, the {{accident}} released up to 10 <b>petabecquerels</b> of radioactiveiodine-131 per {{hour in the}} initial days, and up to 630 PBq total, about one eighth the 5200 PBq released at Chernobyl.However, {{in view of the}} later scandals, NISA's data should perhaps be treated with caution.|$|R
25|$|On 24 August 2011, the Nuclear Safety Commission (NSC) of Japan {{published}} {{the results of}} the recalculation of the total amount of radioactive materials released into the air during the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station. The total amounts released between 11March and 5April were revised downwards to 130PBq (<b>petabecquerels,</b> 3.5 megacuries) for iodine-131 and 11PBq for caesium-137, which is about 11% of Chernobyl emissions. Earlier estimations were 150PBq and 12PBq.|$|R
