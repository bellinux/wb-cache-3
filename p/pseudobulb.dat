2500|$|Leptotes bicolor is {{the species}} with more flowers per {{inflorescence}} {{and with a}} wider distribution. It is [...] a variable species, {{even though it is}} easily identified because of its bicolored flowers, white sepals and petals and purple lip; occasionally it will bear two leaves per <b>pseudobulb.</b> There are some records of this species living as a lithophyte.|$|E
2500|$|Species {{assigned}} to the genus Leptotes have a short cylindrical rhizome. They have small pseudobulbs that almost imperceptibly prolongate in one, rarely two, terete fleshy leaves. They have variable characteristics and can be short or long, erect or hanging, dark green or purple, and often have a wrinkly surface and a deeper ridge in the face. The inflorescence is apical, generally short, and grows from {{the apex of the}} <b>pseudobulb</b> without a protecting spathe and bears up to seven flowers, although fewer are more common. The flowers are relatively large when compared to the overall plant dimensions, normally partially bent and in some species forming groups with a very showy aspect. They are fragrant and this perfume can last from ten to twenty days.: Serra dos Órgãos sua história e suas orquídeas, p. 240. Rio de Janeiro, 2006.|$|E
50|$|With ageing, the <b>pseudobulb</b> sheds {{its leaves}} and becomes dormant. At this stage, {{it is often}} called a backbulb. Backbulbs still hold {{nutrition}} for the plant, but then a <b>pseudobulb</b> usually takes over, exploiting the last reserves accumulated in the backbulb, which eventually dies off, too. A <b>pseudobulb</b> typically lives for about five years. Orchids without noticeable pseudobulbs are also said to have growths, an individual component of a sympodial plant.|$|E
50|$|They have thick, cigar-shaped <b>pseudobulbs</b> {{which are}} clustered. The leaves are pleated {{in the upper}} part and deciduous. The <b>pseudobulbs</b> become spiny after the leaves have dropped.|$|R
50|$|Description: Epiphyte or epilith (a {{plant that}} grows on stone or stone-like material) with {{rhizomes}} prostrate, 2-4 mm between <b>pseudobulbs.</b> The plant forms a dense mat; <b>pseudobulbs</b> flattened-globose, 2-3 mm diam., smooth.|$|R
50|$|The plants {{grow from}} a {{creeping}} rhizome with inter-spaced <b>pseudobulbs</b> with one apical, usually pleated leaf. These plants bloom {{from the base}} of the <b>pseudobulbs,</b> and produce a raceme of up to 10 flowers.|$|R

40|$|Cryptocentrum beckendorfii is {{described}} and illustrated {{from a single}} cultivated plant reputedly from the Amazonian slopes in the Cuzco region of Andean Peru. This species is similar to C. pseudobulbosum, also from the Amazonian slopes of the Andes, with which it shares sympodial habit with <b>pseudobulbs</b> unlike most species of the genus, which are monopodial and lack <b>pseudobulbs.</b> It differs from C. pseudobulbosum in its larger <b>pseudobulbs,</b> which are totally naked upon maturity, thinly coriaceous, conduplicate foliar blades, sheaths enveloping the <b>pseudobulbs</b> lacking foliar blades and the much longer inflorescences with thin peduncles, among other characters.

50|$|Their <b>pseudobulbs</b> are round or oblong {{and each}} carry {{one or two}} {{lanceolate}} leaves.

Every <b>pseudobulb</b> is only active {{for one year}} and carries one or two pleated parallel-veined leaves, with a length of 15 - 30 cm. These drop off before winter. The <b>pseudobulb</b> stays dormant, till a new one starts to develop. This one produces new roots and a short pedicel. This <b>pseudobulb</b> remains active {{till the end of}} the bloom.
