25|$|CIR-ELKE is an {{improvement}} {{on the basic}} LZB system. It uses the same <b>physical</b> <b>interface</b> and packets as standard LZB but upgrades its software, adding capabilities and modifying some procedures. It is designed to increase line capacity by up to 40% and to further shorten travel times. The name is an abbreviation of the English/German project title Computer Integrated Railroading - Erhöhung der Leistungsfähigkeit im Kernnetz der Eisenbahn (Computer Integrated Railroading - Increase Capacity in the Core Railway Network). Being an extension of LZB it is also called LZB-CIR-ELKE further abbreviated into LZB-CE.|$|E

25|$|Composition on the Table (1998/99) {{comprises}} {{four white}} tables bearing <b>physical</b> <b>interface</b> components: switches, dials, and turntables. Computer graphics images are projected onto the tables from ceiling-mounted video projectors, and loudspeakers are present. As the audience manipulates the interface elements, graphical and audio changes {{take place in}} a way that is intimately connected to the audience's input. The objective of this work was to create a mixed reality environment where multiple participants could create visuals and music together. Elements of this work are recognizable in Iwai's Nintendo DS videogame Electroplankton. The piece was presented as part of the Art Gallery at SIGGRAPH'99, Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|Sasha began DJing with Ableton Live in his live act as well, {{using it}} in tandem with turntables. Having {{explored}} its functionality, Sasha found that he could perform entirely through Ableton Live. He then co-developed the Maven controller, which he uses as a <b>physical</b> <b>interface</b> to the Live software. [...] (DJing with a mouse alone, he has said, is [...] "not going to look right or feel right".) [...] Fundacion NYC was the first album on which he regularly used the Maven controller. [...] During DJ sets, clubbers often believe Sasha is playing new, unheard remixes; in fact, he is often playing modifications of tracks created in Ableton. [...] Sasha most often uses the built-in Ableton plugins, preferring their superior stability and performance over third party plugins. [...] For the first public performance of Involver material, he used a PowerBook running Ableton, but has since shifted to a setup that includes an iMac G5 and Ableton Live. [...] Despite Sasha's insistence that Ableton Live allows for greater creativity and spontaneity, [...] "vinyl purists" [...] have accused him of taking much of the challenge and mystique out of DJing by using software in performances.|$|E

If such a link were created, the network would become equivalent to Reality as the general consensus of all perceptions and knowledge.
