5|$|M. nigriceps {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to M. vindex, but several morphological characters distinguish these two species from each other. For example, M. nigriceps is generally larger than M. vindex, and its head is either black or dark brown; the head is broader and more rectangular in workers. The thorax and <b>pedicel</b> are noticeably darker and brownish red. The nests and behaviour, however, of both ants are similar to each other.|$|E
5|$|Most {{worker and}} soldier {{termites}} are completely blind {{as they do}} not have a pair of eyes. However, some species, such as Hodotermes mossambicus, have compound eyes which they use for orientation and to distinguish sunlight from moonlight. The alates have eyes along with lateral ocelli. Lateral ocelli, however, are not found in all termites. Like other insects, termites have a small tongue-shaped labrum and a clypeus; the clypeus is divided into a postclypeus and anteclypeus. Termite antennae have a number of functions such as the sensing of touch, taste, odours (including pheromones), heat and vibration. The three basic segments of a termite antenna include a scape, a <b>pedicel</b> (typically shorter than the scape), and the flagellum (all segments beyond the scape and <b>pedicel).</b> The mouth parts contain a maxillae, a labium, and a set of mandibles. The maxillae and labium have palps that help termites sense food and handling.|$|E
5|$|Anatomically, spiders {{differ from}} other {{arthropods}} {{in that the}} usual body segments are fused into two tagmata, the cephalothorax and abdomen, and joined by a small, cylindrical <b>pedicel.</b> Unlike insects, spiders do not have antennae. In all except the most primitive group, the Mesothelae, spiders have the most centralized nervous systems of all arthropods, as all their ganglia are fused into one mass in the cephalothorax. Unlike most arthropods, spiders have no extensor muscles in their limbs and instead extend them by hydraulic pressure.|$|E
50|$|The Bowman's capsule has {{an outer}} parietal layer {{composed}} of simple squamous epithelium. The visceral layer, composed of modified simple squamous epithelium, is lined by podocytes. Podocytes have foot processes, <b>pedicels,</b> that wrap around glomerular capillaries. These <b>pedicels</b> interdigitate with <b>pedicels</b> of adjacent podocytes forming filtration slits.|$|R
50|$|The spikelets {{themselves}} are ovate and are 7 - 8 mm long while rhachilla internodes is 2 mm long. Fertile spikelets are <b>pediceled,</b> the <b>pedicels</b> {{of which are}} filiform and puberulous. Florets are diminished at the apex.|$|R
5000|$|Spikelets are obovate, solitary, 4 - 6 mm {{long and}} are <b>pediceled.</b> The <b>pedicels</b> are filiform. Besides the <b>pedicels,</b> the spikelets have 2 fertile florets which are diminished at the apex. The sterile florets are also present and are barren, cuneate and clumped. Both {{the upper and}} lower glumes are keelless, {{membranous}} and oblong with acute apexes. The size is different though; Lower glume is 3.5 mm while the upper one is 4 mm long.|$|R
5|$|Spiders are chelicerates, which {{differ from}} other {{arthropods}} {{in that the}} usual body segments are fused into only two tagmata, the cephalothorax and abdomen. Jumping spiders have a distinctive rectangular carapace. All spiders' abdomens bear appendages that have been modified into spinnerets that extrude silk from up to six types of silk glands within their abdomen. The cephalothorax and abdomen are joined by a small, cylindrical <b>pedicel,</b> which allows the abdomen to move while spinning silk. While most jumping spiders do not build webs to catch prey, they use silk for other purposes, including moulting and laying eggs.|$|E
5|$|Spores are spherical, hyaline (translucent), {{and measure}} 2.5–3.4μm in diameter. They are {{thick-walled}} {{with a short}} <b>pedicel</b> (a tubelike extension), and are ornamented with tiny spines (verrucae) that are roughly equidistant from each other. Capillitial threads are long, hyaline, and branched, measuring 2.4–4μm thick. They are septate and occasionally have pits on their walls. The exoperidium comprises thick-walled, inflated hyphae mixed with sphaerocysts (spherical cells), while the endoperidium is made of tightly interwoven, thick-walled hyphae. In the rhizomorphs, the hyphae in the central core are several times as thick {{as those in the}} surrounding subcortex.|$|E
5|$|The spherical spores measure 3–5μm, {{including}} an outer covering (an epispore) of about 0.5μm. Their surface texture ranges from smooth to faintly warted. They have an oil droplet, and a translucent <b>pedicel</b> (a small stalk) up to 2.5μm long. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 10–12.5μm long by 5–7.5μm wide. The capillitium comprises short, highly branched (resembling antlers) and entangled threads measuring 5–10μm wide with walls up to 2.5μm thick. Capillitial threads {{do not have}} septa.|$|E
50|$|The {{specimen}} {{recorded by}} {{me from the}} Malay Peninsula deviates more N. alata, especially by the long, narrow inflorescence and 2-flowered <b>pedicels,</b> {{but also in the}} Philippines and Sumatra forms with 2-flowered <b>pedicels</b> have been found (Ramos 14650, Lörzing 11603).|$|R
40|$|Our {{recent work}} {{describing}} Cucumis zambianus Widrlechner, J. H. Kirkbr., Ghebretinsae 2 ̆ 6 K. R. Reitsma, {{a new species}} from Zambia, led us to spend considerable time documenting inflorescence characteristics in this new species and comparing them to other, similar Cucumis taxa (10). Cucumis zambianus and C. anguria share a trait that is rather unusual, <b>pedicels</b> that are often considerably longer than the fruits they subtend. However, in C. zambianus, the <b>pedicels</b> are of considerable length (65 - 120 mm) {{at the time that}} female flowers open (10), while C. anguria is reported by some authors (but not others) to have much shorter <b>pedicels</b> at that developmental stage, with elongation evidently occurring rapidly (8) during the course of fruit maturity. Kirkbride (7) indicated that the <b>pedicels</b> of female flowers of C. anguria are initially quite short, ranging from 1. 5 to 7 mm, but other authors, including Howard (3) and Jeffrey (4 - 6) reported much longer <b>pedicels,</b> from 13 to 105 mm...|$|R
5000|$|Flowers: May, June, when {{leaves are}} half-grown; diœcious or rarely polygamous. Staminate flowers borne {{in two to}} three-flowered cymes; the <b>pedicels</b> downy and bearing two minute bracts. Pistillate flowers solitary, usually on {{separate}} trees, their <b>pedicels</b> short, recurved, and bearing two bractlets.|$|R
5|$|Although {{there is}} great {{diversity}} in scale form, they all share a similar structure. Scales, like other macrochaetes, arise from special trichogenic (hair-producing) cells and have a socket which is enclosed in a special 'tormogen' cell; this arrangement provides a stalk or <b>pedicel</b> by which scales {{are attached to the}} substrate. Scales may be piliform (hairlike) or flattened. The body or 'blade' of a typical flattened scale consists of an upper and lower lamella with an air-space in between. The surface towards the body is smooth and known as the inferior lamella. The upper surface, or superior lamella, has transverse and longitudinal ridges and ribs. The lamellae are held apart by struts called trabaculae and contain pigments which give colour. The scales cling somewhat loosely to the wing and come off easily without harming the butterfly.|$|E
5|$|As a vespid wasp, P. exclamans nests are {{typically}} {{made up of}} paper with a single layer of cells with open combs. Although nest size varies, the upper limit is around 500 cells. Although many vespid wasp nests have an outer envelope of paper, P. exclamans nests do not. As indicated by Strassmann and Orgren, “Nests are approximately circular, and have a single off-center <b>pedicel</b> usually located towards {{the top of the}} nest. Cells near the pedicle are the oldest.” P. exclamans are particularly able to colonize new sites as foundresses often disperse into new territories. P. exclamans have often been found to have nests located near man-made structures and tend to more readily build nests in and near these man-made structures. Out of six wasp species, P. exclamans {{was the only one that}} occupied artificial nesting sites. It prefers well-lit, open sites.|$|E
5|$|Characteristics {{typically}} {{used to identify}} Bovista pila in the field include its relatively small size, the metallic lustre of the endoperidium, {{and the presence of}} rhizomorphs. B.plumbea is similar in appearance, but can be distinguished by its typically smaller fruit body and the blue-gray color of its inner coat. Unlike B.pila, B.plumbea is attached to the ground by a mass of mycelial fibers known as a sterile base. Microscopically, B.plumbea has larger spores (5–7 by 4.5–6.0μm); with long pedicels (9–14μm). Another lookalike is the European B.nigrescens, which can most reliably be distinguished from B.pila by its microscopic characteristics. The spores of B.nigrescens are oval rather than spherical, rougher than those of B.pila, and have a hyaline (translucent) <b>pedicel</b> about equal in length to the spore diameter (5μm). The puffball Disciseda pila was named for its external resemblance to B.pila. Found in Texas and Argentina, it has much larger, warted spores that measure 7.9–9.4μm.|$|E

2500|$|Flowers: May, June, when {{leaves are}} half-grown; diœcious or rarely polygamous. [...] Staminate flowers borne {{in two to}} three-flowered cymes; the <b>pedicels</b> downy and bearing two minute bracts. [...] Pistillate flowers solitary, usually on {{separate}} trees, their <b>pedicels</b> short, recurved, and bearing two bractlets.|$|R
50|$|Fruit: A shiny dark purple berry held in racemose {{clusters}} on pink <b>pedicels</b> {{with a pink}} peduncle. <b>Pedicels</b> without berries have {{a distinctive}} rounded five part calyx. Fruits are round with a flat indented top and bottom. Immature berries are green, turning white and then blackish purple.|$|R
5|$|Occurring {{in spring}} (August to October), {{the bright red}} or orange-red inflorescences are {{terminal}} and well displayed, and consist of anywhere from 10 to 52 individual flowers split into smaller groups of 2 to 20 flowers, arranged in a corymb. The flowers sit atop stalks (known as pedicels) up to 3.5cm (1.6in) in length, which arise in pairs off main horizontal stalks within the inflorescence. Each flower consists of a tubular perianth up to 4cm (1.8in) long, which partly splits along one side at anthesis to release the thick style. The stigma is contained within a slanting disc-like structure {{at the tip of}} the style. The tubular perianth splits into four segments at its tip, and the anther lies in the concave parts within each of these segments. The <b>pedicel</b> and the outer surface of the perianth are pubescent (covered in short fine fur). Flowers are followed by woody rectangular seed pods that sit on long stalks, and are 7–10cm (2.8–4in) long. Each pod contains 8 to 10seeds, and is ripe in February and March. Each seed is separated from the others by a membranous separator, and has a long rectangular wing, which is much longer than the seed itself. The seedlings have obovate cotyledons that are 0.8–1cm (0.3–0.4in) wide by 1cm (0.4in) long.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pedicel</b> – stems {{that serve}} as the stalk of an {{individual}} flower in an inflorescence or infrutescence.|$|E

25|$|Gastonia is a genus {{of small}} to large trees. It shares with related genera, {{the lack of}} an {{articulation}} on the <b>pedicel,</b> below the flower. It is distinguished from Reynoldsia, Munroidendron, and Tetraplasandra by the radiating style arms that persist on the fruit.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} {{segments}} in an antenna varies considerably amongst insects, with higher flies having only 3-6 segments, while adult cockroaches can have over 140. The general {{shape of the}} antennae is also quite variable, but the first segment (the one attached to the head) is always called the scape, and the second segment is called the <b>pedicel.</b> The remaining antennal segments or flagellomeres are called the flagellum.|$|E
25|$|The nests {{created by}} P. snelleni are made vertically. They {{typically}} {{consist of a}} single comb. The comb is fan-shaped and the <b>pedicel</b> {{is attached to the}} basal cell. This set up allows new cells to be added distally. The founding queen uses twigs or the surface of rock overhangs as horizontal supports for the nest. The nest petioles (stem) are perpendicular to these supports. These wasps occupy a vertical zone of 200–400 meters.|$|E

25|$|Schizomida is {{an order}} of arachnids that tend {{to live in the}} top layer of soils. Schizomids present the prosoma covered by a large protopeltidium and smaller, paired, mesopeltidia and metapeltidia. There are no eyes. The opisthosoma is a smooth oval of 12 {{recognisable}} somites. The first is reduced and forms the <b>pedicel.</b> The last three are much constricted, forming the pygidium. The last somite bears the flagellum, which in this order is short and consists of not more than four segments.|$|E
500|$|Darwin {{described}} [...] "the {{most remarkable}} of all Orchids", Catasetum, and showed how in these flowers, [...] "as throughout nature, pre-existing structures and capacities [...] utilised for new purposes". He explained the mechanism {{in which the}} pollen masses of the pollinium were connected by a bent stalk or <b>pedicel</b> to a sticky disc kept moist {{at the back of}} the flower. When an insect touched an [...] "antenna" [...] projecting from the back of the flower, this released the bent <b>pedicel</b> which sprang straight and fired the pollinium, sticky disc first, at the insect. In experiments, Darwin had imitated this action using a whalebone spring. He vividly illustrated how the flower ejected the pollinium with considerable force: [...] "I touched the antennæ of C. callosum whilst holding the flower at about a yard's distance from the window, and the pollinium hit the pane of glass, and adhered to the smooth vertical surface by its adhesive disc." ...|$|E
500|$|In spiders, the {{cephalothorax}} and abdomen {{are joined}} by a small, cylindrical <b>pedicel,</b> which enables the abdomen to move independently when producing silk. The upper surface of the cephalothorax is covered by a single, [...] carapace, while the underside is covered by two rather flat plates. The abdomen is soft and egg-shaped. It {{shows no sign of}} segmentation, except that the primitive Mesothelae, whose living members are the Liphistiidae, have segmented plates on the upper surface.|$|E
