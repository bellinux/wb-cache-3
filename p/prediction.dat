40|$|Background Traditional null {{hypothesis}} significance testing suffers many limitations and is poorly adapted to theory testing. Purpose A proposed alternative approach, called Testing Theory-based Quantitative <b>Predictions,</b> uses effect size estimates and confidence intervals to directly test <b>predictions</b> based on theory. Method This paper replicates findings from previous smoking studies and extends {{the approach to}} diet and sun protection behaviors using baseline data from a Transtheoretical Model behavioral intervention (N[*]=[*] 5407). Effect size <b>predictions</b> were developed using two methods: (1) applying refined effect size estimates from previous smoking research or (2) using <b>predictions</b> developed by an expert panel. Results Thirteen of 15 <b>predictions</b> were confirmed for smoking. For diet, 7 of 14 <b>predictions</b> were confirmed using smoking <b>predictions</b> and 6 of 16 using expert panel <b>predictions.</b> For sun protection, 3 of 11 <b>predictions</b> were confirmed using smoking <b>predictions</b> and 5 of 19 using expert panel <b>predictions.</b> Conclusion Expert panel <b>predictions</b> and smoking-based <b>predictions</b> poorly predicted effect sizes for diet and sun protection constructs. Future studies should aim to use previous empirical data to generate <b>predictions</b> whenever possible. The best results occur when {{there have been several}} iterations of <b>predictions</b> for a behavior, such as with smoking, demonstrating that expected values begin to converge on the population effect size. Overall, the study supports necessity in strengthening and revising theory with empirical data...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{exchangeable}} analogical <b>predictions,</b> and proposes a Bayesian model for such <b>predictions.</b> The paper first discerns {{two kinds of}} analogical <b>predictions,</b> based on similarity of individuals and of types respectively.

Exchangeable <b>predictions</b> based on type similarity are determined by prior probabilities over the partition, but the partition obstructs the control over the similarity relations. Finally the paper develops a model for exchangeable <b>predictions</b> based on type similarity, which employs hypotheses on similarity between individuals, thereby offering a better control over the similarity relations. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Tasks such as forecasting, diagnosis, and {{planning}} frequently require quantitative <b>predictions.</b> Typically, quantitative <b>predictions</b> are obtained by characterizing {{a system in}} terms of algebraic relationships and then using these relationships to compute quantitative <b>predictions</b> from numerical data. For real-life systems, such as mainframe operating systems, an algebraic characterization is often difficult, if not intractable. This paper proposes a statistical approach to obtaining quantitative <b>predictions</b> from monotone relationships [...] non-parametric interpolative-prediction for monotone functions (NIMF). NIMF uses monotone relationships to search historical data for bounds that provide a desired level of statistical confidence. We evaluate NIMF by comparing its <b>predictions</b> to those of linear least-squares regression (a widely-used statistical technique that requires specifying algebraic relationships) for memory contention in an IBM computer system. We find that NIMF consistently produces better <b>predictions,</b> which we attribute (in part) to using an accurate monotone relationship instead of an approximate algebraic relationship. We also show that using monotone relationships to produce quantitative <b>predictions</b> greatly facilitates explaining the resulting <b>predictions.</b> 1...|$|R
