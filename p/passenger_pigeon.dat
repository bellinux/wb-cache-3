5|$|The {{mourning}} dove is a related species to the <b>passenger</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Ectopistes migratorius), which was hunted to extinction {{in the early}} 1900s. For this reason, {{the possibility of using}} {{mourning dove}}s for cloning the <b>passenger</b> <b>pigeon</b> has been discussed.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{the wood}} pigeon is {{commonly}} shot {{as a game}} bird, while rock pigeons were originally domesticated as a food species, and many breeds were developed for their meat-bearing qualities. The extinction of the <b>passenger</b> <b>pigeon</b> in North America was at least partly due to shooting for use as food. Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management contains recipes for roast pigeon and pigeon pie, a popular, inexpensive food in Victorian industrial Britain.|$|E
5|$|Populations {{of large}} land mammals such as caribou, moose, deer, elk, have been declining {{dramatically}} since the reintroduction of wolves. Species almost entirely gone {{that were once}} common in the area include the white-tailed jackrabbit, pygmy short-horned lizard, band-tailed pigeon and <b>passenger</b> <b>pigeon.</b> After exploitation of the Kootenay basin by fur trappers, the beaver population was nearly exterminated as well.|$|E

5|$|While {{many species}} of pigeons and doves have benefited from human {{activities}} and have increased their ranges, many other species have declined in numbers and some have become threatened or even succumbed to extinction. Among the ten species to have become extinct since 1600 (the conventional date for estimating modern extinctions) {{are two of the}} most famous extinct species, the dodo and the <b>passenger</b> <b>pigeon.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>passenger</b> <b>pigeon</b> was {{exceptional}} for {{a number}} of reasons. In modern times, it is the only pigeon species that was not an island species to have become extinct even though it was once the most numerous species of bird on Earth. Its former numbers are difficult to estimate, but one ornithologist, Alexander Wilson, estimated one flock he observed contained over two billion birds. The decline of the species was abrupt; in 1871, a breeding colony was estimated to contain over a hundred million birds, yet the last individual in the species was dead by 1914. Although habitat loss was a contributing factor, the species is thought to have been massively over-hunted, being used as food for slaves and, later, the poor, in the United States throughout the 19thcentury.|$|E
25|$|Many species {{breed in}} colonies or large communities, known as {{communal}} breeding. It {{is common to}} see large congregations of these species in particularly favorable locations during their breeding seasons. These breeding colonies and their locations are generally protected by wildlife conservation laws to keep the species from going extinct. Some species have evolved for communal breeding in large breeding colonies and cannot breed in smaller numbers or pairs alone. These species can be threatened by imminent extinction if they are hunted on their breeding grounds or if their breeding colonies are destroyed. The <b>passenger</b> <b>pigeon</b> is a famous example of probably the most numerous land bird on the American continent which had evolved for communal breeding. Due to large scale hunting in its communal breeding grounds during the breeding season and its inability to breed in smaller numbers, the <b>passenger</b> <b>pigeon</b> went extinct.|$|E

25|$|Paleoindian {{sites with}} {{preserved}} faunal and floral records, such as Stanfield-Worley Bluff Shelter, {{are important to}} understanding cultural development during the period. The faunal remains of the site contain bones of modern animals including deer, squirrel, turkey, and porcupine. The shelter is located below the southern extent of the current range of porcupines. In addition, remains of the extinct <b>passenger</b> <b>pigeon</b> have been found. Although the animals which the Dalton occupants hunted {{are similar to those}} hunted by Archaic peoples, there is no evidence in the zone of shellfish collection or seed processing, traits of established Archaic societies.|$|E
25|$|The egg collection, {{consisting}} of 10,400 sets representing 733 species, is 11th largest in North America {{in number of}} sets and 15th largest in number of species. It represents approximately 90% of the species and subspecies of North American birds. The egg collection has grown by 1% {{in the last five}} years. It is cataloged in a card file that includes original collectors' data slips or page references to the collector's field notes. Especially well represented are sets from New England and Florida. The collection is rich in sets of raptor eggs, including bald eagles, ospreys, broad-winged hawks, red-shouldered hawks, northern caracaras, American kestrels, the Florida races of seaside sparrows and clapper rails. Rarities include sets of <b>passenger</b> <b>pigeon,</b> Carolina parakeet, and Bachman's warbler eggs.|$|E
25|$|The first {{settlers}} {{in what would}} be Newburgh Township were David Bryant and his son, Whitman, who arrived in June 1797. East of the Portage Escarpment, they found dense forests of American sycamore, beech, black walnut, eastern hemlock, eastern redcedar, northern red oak, Ohio buckeye, shagbark hickory, sugar maple, and white oak. West of the escarpment were American elm, ash, beech, and black cherry. In some places, settlers would have seen artificial meadows, created by Native Americans using controlled fire. On the flats which formed {{the valley of the}} Cuyahoga River bluegrass, white clover, and wild rye grew in profusion. American bison, eastern elk, and the extremely plentiful white-tailed deer were the most common game animals inhabiting the area. Canada geese, ducks, grouse, <b>passenger</b> <b>pigeon,</b> quail, and wild turkey were the most common game fowl.|$|E

25|$|The Mediterranean {{and other}} seas present a major {{obstacle}} to soaring birds, which must cross at the narrowest points. Massive numbers of large raptors and storks pass through areas such as Gibraltar, Falsterbo, and the Bosphorus at migration times. More common species, such as the European honey buzzard, can be counted in hundreds of thousands in autumn. Other barriers, such as mountain ranges, can also cause funnelling, particularly of large diurnal migrants. This is a notable factor in the Central American migratory bottleneck. This concentration of birds during migration can put species at risk. Some spectacular migrants have already gone extinct, the most notable being the <b>passenger</b> <b>pigeon.</b> During migration the flocks were a mile (1.6km) wide and 300 miles (500km) long, taking several days to pass and containing up to a billion birds.|$|E
25|$|The <b>passenger</b> <b>pigeon</b> was hunted in Northern Michigan as {{a source}} of food, but by the 1870s, a {{combination}} of increased population and economic scarcity led to over-hunting and eventual extinction. The massive flocks of passenger pigeons stopped darkening the skies of Northern Michigan, especially after the last large scale nestings and subsequent slaughters of millions of birds in 1874 and 1878. By this time, large nestings only took place in the north, around the Great Lakes. The last large nesting was in Petoskey, Michigan, in 1878 (following one in Pennsylvania a few days earlier), where 50,000 birds were killed each day for nearly five months. The surviving adults attempted a second nesting at new sites, but were killed by professional hunters before they had a chance to raise any young. Scattered nestings were reported into the 1880s, but the birds were now weary, and commonly abandoned their nests if persecuted.|$|E
25|$|Historical {{records show}} that this beetle once lived in 35 states of the United States, the District of Columbia, and three Canadian provinces: Ontario, Quebec, and Nova Scotia. Now, natural populations are known to occur in only five states {{and at least one}} province: on Block Island in Rhode Island, Oklahoma, Arkansas, South Dakota, Nebraska and Ontario. They have also been reintroduced to Ohio. In Oklahoma, {{petitions}} were made in 2015 and 2016 to delist the species from endangered status as it came {{in the way of the}} oil and gas industry in the region. N. americanus was listed as an endangered species in 1989; the IUCN lists the species as critically endangered. Biologists have determined conclusively why N. americanus has disappeared from so many areas. Widespread use of pesticides may have caused local populations to disappear. The dramatic disappearance of this insect from many areas, however, took place before widespread use of DDT. Lack of small carcasses to bury would prevent the species from reproducing, and changes in land use has reduced the quantity of small- to medium-sized birds and mammals preferred by N. americanus. Even the extinction of the once ubiquitous <b>passenger</b> <b>pigeon</b> may have had a ripple effect on carrion feeders like this beetle.|$|E

2500|$|In culinary terminology, squab {{is a young}} {{domestic}} pigeon, typically under {{four weeks}} old, or its meat. The meat is widely described as tasting like dark chicken. The term is probably of Scandinavian origin; the Swedish word skvabb means [...] "loose, fat flesh". It formerly applied to all dove and pigeon species, such as the wood pigeon, the mourning dove, the extinct-in-the-wild socorro dove, and the now-extinct <b>passenger</b> <b>pigeon,</b> and their meat. More recently, squab meat comes almost entirely from domesticated pigeons. The meat of dove and pigeon gamebirds hunted primarily for sport is rarely called squab.|$|E

2500|$|In 1691 {{the buffalo}} (bison bison) roamed the prairies by the thousands. [...] "The Buffalo (were) so {{numerous}} (that the riders were) obliged {{to make them}} sheer out of our way." [...] -Henday Bone beds have been uncovered showing mass kills of bison herds {{at the base of}} buffalo jumps and within wood and stone corrals. Habitat destruction from homesteaders breaking the land combined with hunting practices brought the huge population to near extinction. Similarly, vast flights of passenger pigeons (Ectopistes migratorius) were reported by Peter Fidler in the early 19th century. The sky darkened for hours as flocks of migrating pigeons passed. Forest habitat destruction and wholesale hunting brought the <b>passenger</b> <b>pigeon</b> to extinction. The eskimo curlew (Numenius borealis), a shorebird who was also seen historically in great numbers met a similar extinction due to changing habitats and diminishing numbers from hunting.|$|E
2500|$|Chipped flint {{points and}} {{charcoal}} from campfires {{provide evidence that}} occupation of Russell Cave began nearly 10,000 years ago by southeastern Archaic period Native Americans. The charcoal remains of the first fires in the cavern date to between 6550 and 6145 BCE based on radiocarbon dating. As they maintained their existence as hunter-gatherers, {{it is likely that}} the cave was only occupied during the autumn and winter seasons. According to John Griffin, the issue of seasonality (during what season or seasons the cave was utilized) remains to be determined. Evidence indicating inhabitance in autumn and winter include deer bones and <b>passenger</b> <b>pigeon</b> remains. The presence of shellfish artifacts clouds the determination somewhat since shellfish would have been easier to procure during periods of dry weather in mid-spring and late summer. However, William J. Clench has suggested that the occupants may have brought mussels and snails to nearby bodies of water (Dry Creek and/or Crownover Springs) for use as needed including in autumn or winter. Based on the existing information, Griffin is [...] "strongly inclined" [...] to view Russell Cave as a place of winter occupancy.|$|E
60|$|But {{perfection}} of structure and adaptation to purpose, are not universal characteristics of birds' nests, {{since there are}} decided imperfections in the nesting of many birds which are quite compatible with our present theory, but are hardly so with that of instinct, {{which is supposed to}} be infallible. The <b>Passenger</b> <b>pigeon</b> of America often crowds the branches with its nests till they break, and the ground is strewn with shattered nests, eggs, and young birds. Rooks' nests are often so imperfect that during high winds the eggs fall out; but the Window-Swallow is the most unfortunate in this respect, for White, of Selborne, informs us that he has seen them build, year after year, in places where their nests are liable to be washed away by a heavy rain and their young ones destroyed.|$|E
