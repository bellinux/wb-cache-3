25|$|In 1985, Stevens stepped down, {{and handed}} the nation’s preeminent {{position}} to Major General Joseph Momoh, a notoriously inept leader who maintained the status quo. During his seven-year tenure, Momoh welcomed the spread of unchecked corruption and complete economic collapse. With the state unable to pay its civil servants, those desperate enough ransacked and looted government offices and property. Even in Freetown, important commodities like gasoline were scarce. But the government hit rock bottom when it could no longer pay schoolteachers and the education system collapsed. Since only wealthy families could afford to pay private tutors, the bulk of Sierra Leone’s youth during the late 1980s roamed the streets aimlessly. As infrastructure and <b>public</b> <b>ethics</b> deteriorated in tandem, much of Sierra Leone’s professional class fled the country. By 1991, Sierra Leone was ranked {{as one of the}} poorest countries in the world, even though it benefited from ample natural resources including diamonds, gold, bauxite, rutile, iron ore, fish, coffee, and cocoa.|$|E

40|$|The article {{starts with}} a brief and concise {{definition}} of <b>public</b> sector <b>ethics.</b> It traces the origin of <b>public</b> sector <b>ethics</b> in the United Kingdom (UK). Also, corruption and unethical conduct amongst others are in focus too.

The mechanisms include codes of conduct and the use of regulatory bodies. To remedy the defects inherent in the extant <b>public</b> sector <b>ethics</b> in the UK, some recommendations will be made.

40|$|The {{last decade}} has {{witnessed}} {{development of the}} new field of <b>public</b> health <b>ethics,</b> as well as growing emphasis {{on the importance of}} ethics education to both students and graduates of the health care professions. Using a topic-based interpretation of <b>public</b> health <b>ethics</b> this paper presents a questionnaire survey of the nature and content of teaching of <b>public</b> health <b>ethics</b> to medical undergraduates and public health postgraduate students in the United Kingdom. Completed questionnaires were returned by 76. 9 % (20 / 26) of medical schools and 76. 7 % (23 / 30) of institutions teaching postgraduate public health courses. <b>Public</b> health <b>ethics</b> was described as being taught in 75 % of medical schools and 52 % of institutions providing postgraduate education. However, in both types of location the content and nature of teaching was patchy and often minimal. If medical schools and postgraduate institutions are serious about improving the discussion and teaching of ethical issues in public health, there will need to be considerable investment and commitment, accompanied by creativity and imagination. In parallel, the debate about the meaning of, and approaches to, <b>public</b> health <b>ethics</b> needs to be broadened and enriched.

60|$|But if in {{any case}} it should happen that a class or a {{generation}} lose {{the sense of the}} peculiar kind of joy which is being celebrated, they immediately begin to call the enjoyers of that joy gloomy and self-destroying. The most formidable liberal philosophers have called the monks melancholy because they denied themselves the pleasures of liberty and marriage. They might as well call the trippers on a Bank Holiday melancholy because they deny themselves, as a rule, the pleasures of silence and meditation. A simpler and stronger example is, however, to hand. If ever it should happen that the system of English athletics should vanish from the public schools and the universities, if science should supply some new and non-competitive manner of perfecting the physique, if <b>public</b> <b>ethics</b> swung round to an attitude of absolute contempt and indifference towards the feeling called sport, then {{it is easy to see}} what would happen. Future historians would simply state that in the dark days of Queen Victoria young men at Oxford and Cambridge were subjected to a horrible sort of religious torture. They were forbidden, by fantastic monastic rules, to indulge in wine or tobacco during certain arbitrarily fixed periods of time, before certain brutal fights and festivals. Bigots insisted on their rising at unearthly hours and running violently around fields for no object. Many men ruined their health in these dens of superstition, many died there. All this is perfectly true and irrefutable. Athleticism in England is an asceticism, as much as the monastic rules. Men have over-strained themselves and killed themselves through English athleticism. There is one difference and one only: we do feel the love of sport; we do not feel the love of religious offices. We see only the price in the one case and only the purchase in the other.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{fields of}} human rights and <b>public</b> health <b>ethics</b> are each {{concerned}} with promoting health and elucidating norms for action. To date, however, little {{has been written about the}} contribution that these two justificatory frameworks can make together. This article explores how a combined approach may make a more comprehensive contribution to resolving normative health issues and to advancing a normative framework for global health action than either approach made alone. We explore this synergy by first providing overviews of <b>public</b> health <b>ethics</b> and of international human rights law relevant to health and, second, by articulating complementarities between human rights and <b>public</b> health <b>ethics.</b> Discussion We argue that <b>public</b> health <b>ethics</b> can contribute to human rights by: (a) reinforcing the normative claims of international human rights law, (b) strengthening advocacy for human rights, and (c) bridging the divide between public health practitioners and human rights advocates in certain contemporary health domains. We then discuss how human rights can contribute to <b>public</b> health <b>ethics</b> by contributing to discourses on the determinants of health through: (a) definitions of the right to health and the notion of the indivisibility of rights, (b) emphasis on the duties of states to progressively realize the health of citizens, and (c) recognition of the protection {{of human rights}} as itself a determinant of health. We also discuss the role that human rights can play for the emergent field of <b>public</b> health <b>ethics</b> by refocusing attention on the health and illness on marginalized individuals and populations. Summary Actors within the fields of <b>public</b> health, <b>ethics</b> and human rights can gain analytic tools by embracing the untapped potential for collaboration inherent in such a combined approach. </p...|$|R
