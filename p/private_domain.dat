25|$|An {{interesting}} {{aspect of}} cultural capital that sometimes {{comes into play}} in immigrant families is familiarity with American laws. Parents may find that U.S. law is in conflict with their traditional means of disciplining their children. While parents may be accustomed to certain parental rights in their home country, these rights may not be protected in American society. There may be cases in which outside agents—either school officials, police officers, or government officials—become involved in conflicts between parents and children. This is particularly true in cases of alleged physical abuse. Children, who may be more familiar with American laws, can use this knowledge to gain assistance from individuals outside of the family. The involvement of outside agents may tip the traditional power balance within the family and affords family members who are {{more familiar with the}} rules and norms of the United States a certain degree of power over family members who are not as familiar with these laws. Among immigrants who come from cultures with strict hierarchies based on age, such interventions can be devastating to parents who may feel that their authority has been undermined. Family members who are better assimilated into American culture are more able, and probably more likely, to utilize their knowledge of American laws to change the dynamics of family relations. This generates inequality based on degree of assimilation since those who are less assimilated are more likely to lose face {{as the result of the}} penetration of such laws into the traditionally <b>private</b> <b>domain</b> of the family.|$|E
500|$|None of the {{charters}} are original, and Stevenson dismissed {{all of them}} as fraudulent {{apart from}} the Kentish one of 855. Stevenson saw the decimation as a donation of royal demesne to churches and laymen, with those grants which were made to laymen being on the understanding {{that there would be}} reversion to a religious institution. Up to the 1990s, his view on the authenticity of the charters was generally accepted by scholars, {{with the exception of the}} historian H. P. R. Finberg, who argued in 1964 that most are based on authentic diplomas. Finberg coined the terms the 'First Decimation' of 844, which he saw as the removal of public dues on a tenth of all bookland, and the 'Second Decimation' of 854, the donation of a tenth of [...] "the <b>private</b> <b>domain</b> of the royal house" [...] to the churches. He considered it unlikely that the First Decimation had been carried into effect, probably due to the threat from the Vikings. Finberg's terminology has been adopted, but his defence of the First Decimation generally rejected. In 1994 Keynes defended the Wilton charters in group 2, and his arguments have been widely accepted.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} {{facilitate}} economic extraction from the colony, land was divided up under the so-called Domain System (régime domanial) in 1891. All vacant land, including forests and areas not under cultivation, was decreed to be [...] "uninhabited" [...] and thus the possession of the state, leaving many of the Congo's resources (especially rubber and ivory) under direct colonial ownership. Concessions were allocated to private companies. In the north, the Société Anversoise was given , while the Anglo-Belgian India Rubber Company (ABIR) was given a comparable territory in the south. The Compagnie du Katanga and Compagnie des Grands Lacs were given smaller concessions {{in the south and}} east respectively. Leopold kept a large proportion of territory under personal rule, known as the Crown Domain (Domaine de la Couronne), of [...] which was added to the territory he already controlled under the <b>Private</b> <b>Domain</b> (Domaine privé). [...] "The major economic exploitation of the Congolese interior, therefore, lay {{in the hands of the}} king and a few privileged concessionaries." [...] The system was extremely profitable and ABIR made a turnover of over 100 per cent on its initial stake in a single year. The King made 70 million Belgian francs' profit from the system between 1896 and 1905. The Free State's concession system was soon copied by other colonial regimes, notably those in the neighbouring French Congo.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Satisfaction {{with life}} domains is more highly {{correlated}} with interpersonal than with intrapersonal comparisons (Emmons and Diener, 1985). The hypothesis of the present studies is that the high correlations reflect inferences of social comparison from global satisfaction. Paradoxically, such inferences are most likely in <b>private</b> <b>domains</b> (love life, friends), where social information is scarce and relatively unimportant as a determinant of satisfaction. Study I replicates the Emmons-Diener findings, but also finds that subjects judge recent changes more important than social standing as a determinant of life satisfaction, especially in <b>private</b> <b>domains.</b> Study 1 I examines an order effect in judgments of satisfaction. As hypothesized the correlation between social comparison and global satisfaction is higher (in <b>private</b> <b>domains</b> only) when global satisfaction is judged first than when the order of judgment is reversed. The main goal {{of the study of}} subjective well-being is to understand the causes of human happiness and misery.

500|$|Manning's {{books are}} not easily {{classified}} {{as a part of}} the feminist canon. While Manning supported the rights of women, particularly equal literary fees, she had no sympathy for the Women's Movement, writing that [...] "hey make such an exhibition of themselves. None can be said to be beauties. Most have faces like porridge." [...] In Manning's books, the word [...] "feminine" [...] is used in a derogatory sense, and tends to be associated with female complacency, foolishness, artifice and deviousness, and fulfilment for women comes in fairly conventional roles of wife, mother and the <b>private</b> <b>domain.</b> Elizabeth Bowen remarked that Manning had [...] "an almost masculine outfit in the way of experience" [...] that influenced her writing about women and the war. Manning viewed herself not as a female writer, but as a writer who happened to be a woman, and early in her career she obscured her gender using a pseudonym and initials. Manning found it easier to create male characters, and in general her novels tend to minimise differences in gender, writing about people rather than women in particular. Harriet Pringle, for example, moves through processes of self-discovery and empowerment as an individual rather than in feminist solidarity with her sex. In Manning's The Doves of Venus (1960), based on Manning's friendship with Stevie Smith, female characters display [...] "the 1950s anger more often associated... with young men." [...] Treglown comments on how Manning's early books generally took a forthright approach to sex, often initiated by female characters. Her approach became more nuanced in later volumes, with a subtler depiction of sex, sensuality and sexual frustration in Fortunes of War. The Jungian critic Richard Sugg interpreted Manning's female characters as punishing themselves for breaching society's gender norms, including for having erotic feelings. In contrast, Treglown hypothesised that it reflected Manning's ongoing grieving for her stillborn child.|$|E
