Also {{available}} at [URL] September 2006, graduate {{students at the}} University of Maryland have {{had the option of}} restricting access to their ETD in the university’s digital repository (DRUM) for either a one- or six-year period. Embargo requests must be approved by the student’s faculty advisor and submitted to the Graduate School prior to uploading the ETD. Since the beginning of the program, an average of 32 % of the ETDs that have been submitted each semester have been embargoed. While Engineering has the largest number <b>of</b> <b>embargoes</b> (150), Chemical and Life Sciences has the greatest percentage (54 %), followed closely by Agriculture and Natural Resources (51 %) and Business (47 %). The College of Arts and Humanities, specifically the English Department, has the largest number <b>of</b> six-year <b>embargoes</b> (75). Faculty advisors who had approved at least one embargo request since 2006 were surveyed to gain insight into their perspectives on publicly available ETDs and ascertain their reasons for approving embargo requests. In general, faculty advisors indicated that they approve ETDs without attempting to change the students’ choice <b>of</b> <b>embargo</b> <b>period,</b> indicating that the student {{plays a major role in}} deciding whether or not to embargo their ETD. In addition, faculty stated that the primary reason for approving embargoes was to protect opportunities for future publication.

40|$|THE 1977 UNITED STATES ARMS EMBARGO AGAINST SOUTH AFRICA: INSTITUTION AND IMPLEMENTATION TO 1997 The {{institution}} {{and implementation of}} the 1977 mandatory United States arms embargo against South Africa and the impact thereof on relations between the United States and South Africa is investigated in this study. The investigation centers around the objectives of the United States in instituting the arms embargo, whether these objectives were met through the implementation and enforcement <b>of</b> the arms <b>embargo,</b> and whether the South African reaction to the embargo indicates the failure <b>of</b> the <b>embargo</b> to meet its objectives. The relation <b>of</b> the arms <b>embargo</b> to the foreign policy of the United States Government of the day, as well as the impact <b>of</b> the <b>embargo</b> on the South African military industry is discussed. The basis on which the problem statement is built is that close scrutiny of the implementation <b>of</b> the arms <b>embargo</b> would allow one to judge the seriousness that the United States assigned to the objectives <b>of</b> the arms <b>embargo.</b> The main objective <b>of</b> the <b>embargo</b> was to force the South African Government to abandon apartheid. Full compliance with the embargo would demonstrate the commitment of the United States to this objective, while non-compliance would be regarded by critics as a retreat from that objective. The United States’ implementation <b>of</b> the arms <b>embargo</b> would furthermore demonstrate the ability of major arms producers like the United States to reduce the threat of global violence by putting measures in place to successfully block arms and related items from being exported to potential belligerents. In conclusion to the study, {{it was found that the}} implementation <b>of</b> the <b>embargo</b> was linked to external objectives of the United States Government of the day. Thus, the strengthening or weakening <b>of</b> arms <b>embargo</b> regulations occurred according to the objectives that the Government of the day wanted to achieve. Nonetheless, the United States’ implementation <b>of</b> the arms <b>embargo</b> was generally very effective. It was also concluded that the arms embargo indeed acted as the main stimulant for the development of the world-renowned South African arms industry. This industry developed out of the determination of the white South African minority Government to remain in power, which in turn resulted in a defiant disregard for the arms embargo. Clandestine activities became the order of the day. These activities later had a major impact on the first democratically elected black government in South Africa. This government inherited a legacy <b>of</b> <b>embargo</b> violations, which led to much tension in relations with the United States in the first few years after the 1994 South African elections. The research therefore also paints a picture of the inherited struggles that the new South African Government had to face as a result <b>of</b> the arms <b>embargo,</b> and the resultant difficulties in normalizing relations with the United States.

The version of record is available online at doi: 10. 1016 /j. irfa. 2015. 03. 007 This paper investigates the degree of global versus regional financial integration in Southeast Asia during the period 2004 - 2012. We examine integration in the money and bond markets in Asia by employing a covered-interest-parity-based measure of financial integration. The impact of the 2008 financial crisis {{as well as the}} recent regional bond initiatives on the integration process of Asian money and bond markets respectively are specifically investigated. Empirically, we adopt the Phillips and Sul (2007) convergence methodology that has not been previously employed to examine the integration process in Asian money and bond markets. We find evidence of both global and regional integration in the money market pre 2008 but once the crisis hit, the process of global integration comes to an abrupt halt. However, regional integration, albeit at a slower pace, is still clearly evident in the post-crisis period. As for the Asian bond market, evidence of both global and regional integration is found but, in comparison, the latter is more convergent post 2008. Regional integration is stronger when interest rates with longer maturity are considered. In addition, we identify some convergent sub-groups of countries and this suggests that a multi-tiered style of convergence is present...|$|R
40|$|The {{division}} {{was formed in}} 1946 {{at the suggestion of}} Dr. Eugene P.

It was called the Metallurgy Division and assembled the metallurgical and solid state physics activities of the time which were not directly related to nuclear weapons production. William A. Johnson, a Westinghouse employee, was named Division Director in 1946. In 1949 he was replaced by John H Frye Jr. when the Division consisted of 45 people. He was director during most of what is called the Reactor Project Years until 1973 and his retirement. During this period the Division evolved into three organizational areas: basic research, applied research in nuclear reactor materials, and reactor programs directly related to a specific reactor(s) being designed or built. The Division (Metals and Ceramics) consisted of 204 staff members in 1973 when James R. Weir, Jr., became Director.
