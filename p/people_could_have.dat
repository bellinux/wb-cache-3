5|$|Because Armero's {{hospital}} {{was destroyed in}} the eruption, helicopters moved survivors to nearby hospitals. Six local towns set up makeshift emergency relief clinics, consisting of treatment areas and shelters for the homeless. To help with the treatment, physicians and rescue teams came {{from all over the}} country. Of the 1244 patients spread over the clinics, 150 died from infection or associated complications. Had antibiotics been readily available and all of their lacerations been thoroughly cleaned, many of these <b>people</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been saved.|$|E
5|$|Critics of Plantinga's argument, such as {{philosophers}} Antony Flew, {{have responded}} that it presupposes a libertarian, incompatibilist view {{of free will}} (free will and determinism are metaphysically incompatible), while their view is a compatibilist view of free will (free will and determinism, whether physical or divine, are metaphysically compatible). The view of compatibilists is that God could have created a world containing moral good but no moral evil. In such a world <b>people</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> chosen to only perform good deeds, even though all their choices were predestined.|$|E

25|$|Particularly in the {{province}} of Henan, tens of thousands of farmers and peasants were infected with HIV through participation in these programs.

25|$|The war {{has been}} {{described}} as the largest conflict in Oceania since the end of World War II. PNGDF casualties during the fighting were believed to include more than 300 killed. Meanwhile, the Australian government estimated that anywhere between 15,000–20,000 <b>people</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> died in the Bougainville conflict. However, more conservative estimates put the number of combat deaths as 1,000–2,000. Other sources estimated that around 10,000 Bougainvilleans died of violence or disease during this period, while over 60,000 Bougainvilleans were living in internally displaced persons' camps by the mid-1990s and thousands more had fled to the nearby Solomon Islands.|$|E
25|$|This was {{the last}} {{execution}} conducted in Palmiry in 1940 for which circumstances are at least partially known. However, during the postwar exhumation, three mass graves filled with 74, 28, and 24 corpses respectively, were found at the forest glade. It is certain that first {{two of them were}} filled and buried in the winter of 1940, while the third one was probably dug in the winter of 1940 or 1939. Polish historians were not able to determine the circumstances of those massacres. According to Regina Domańska, about 27 prisoners of Pawiak were executed in Palmiry on 4 December 1940. According to Maria Wardzyńska, up to 260 <b>people</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been murdered in Palmiry in the winter of 1940.|$|E
25|$|Compared to Aristotle and his strictest medieval followers, these Roman {{authors were}} not so strict about the {{boundary}} between animal-like common sense and specially human reasoning. As discussed above, Aristotle had attempted to make a clear distinction between, on the one hand, imagination and the sense perception which both use the sensible koina, and which animals also have; and, on the other hand, nous (intellect) and reason, which perceives another type of koina, the intelligible forms, which (according to Aristotle) only humans have. In other words, these Romans allowed that <b>people</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> animal-like shared understandings of reality, not {{just in terms of}} memories of sense perceptions, {{but in terms of the}} way they would tend to explain things, and in the language they use.|$|E

25|$|The bridge {{question}} has again been revived {{after many years}} of slumber, and business men in Quebec seem hopeful that something will come of it, though the placing of a subsidy on the statute book is but {{a small part of the}} work to be accomplished, as some of its enthusiastic promoters will, ere long, discover. Both Federal and Provincial Governments seem disposed to contribute towards the cost, and the City of Quebec will also be expected to do its share. Many of our people have objected to any contribution being given by the city unless the bridge is built opposite the town, and the CHRONICLE like every other good citizen of Quebec would prefer to see it constructed at Diamond Harbor, and has contended in the interests of the city for this site as long as there seemed to be any possibility of securing it there. It would still do so if it appeared that our <b>people</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> it at that site. A bridge at Diamond Harbor would, it estimated, cost at least eight millions. It would be very nice to have, with its double track, electric car track, and roads for vehicles and pedestrians, and would no doubt create a goodly traffic between the two towns, and be one of the show works of the continent.|$|E
500|$|In Coughlan {{the view}} was {{expressed}} that the court will assess whether it is unfair for an authority to frustrate a legitimate expectation when the expectation is [...] "confined to one person or a few people, giving the promise or representation {{the character of a}} contract". In R. (Bancoult) v. Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (No. 2) (2007), it was accepted that members of a group of close to a thousand or even up to several thousand <b>people</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> a legitimate expectation of a substantive benefit following the government's announcement of its intentions.|$|E
500|$|Because of {{the vast}} scope of the damage, {{initially}} Windsor town officials feared many, possibly even hundreds, of <b>people</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been killed. While there were many serious injuries, only three people {{were killed by the}} storm. Two victims, construction workers working in a bank parking lot, took shelter in a work truck when they saw the storm approach. [...] The first victim was killed immediately by a piece of flying lumber, the other died a few weeks later from his injuries becoming the 3rd victim. The second victim was found the next day across the street from her obliterated house. Over 400 people were hospitalized, mostly for injuries from flying glass or the victims' having been thrown by winds.|$|E

500|$|In {{defending}} his conservatism, Brownlee emphasized that [...] "history {{has yet to}} record a single instance of the revolutionary method that has not resulted in a welter of discord and misery" [...] and mused that [...] "if the results were not so tragical, I {{would like to see}} Canada put under the most extreme form of socialistic or communistic Government in order that our <b>people</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> the actual experience of what would happen and learn for themselves the lesson that in our present day world situation, one nation cannot fashion for itself any level of prosperity regardless of the position {{of the rest of the}} world". [...] Even as he rejected the radical solutions posed by others, Brownlee had no solutions of his own to offer but government thrift and moderate debt adjustment.|$|E
500|$|Guests were {{expected}} to dress to high standards, with men wearing evening suits and the women wearing [...] "gowns with silk gloves reaching the elbow". All women in full evening dress received an orchid or gardenia corsage, compliments of the Stork Club. A requirement for all men was a necktie; {{those who were not}} wearing one were either lent one or had to buy one to gain admittance. Although African Americans were not explicitly barred from entry, there was a mutual understanding that they were not welcome. Billingsley insisted on orderly conduct for all of his Stork Club guests; fighting, drunkenness, or rowdiness were prohibited. He ran the club on the principle of it being a place where <b>people</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> a good time and that it was somewhere he could bring his own family without worrying that they would see or hear something he did not want them to. Billingsley closely controlled the seating placement system in the club. Unescorted women were not allowed to enter the club after 6:00 p.m; this was a protective measure for men who may have been out with someone other than their wives.|$|E
500|$|Ticket {{prices for}} both the Harris Theater and the Pritzker Pavilion have been controversial. John von Rhein, {{classical}} music critic for the Chicago Tribune, notes that the theater's size poses a challenge to performers attempting to fill its seats, and feels that it overemphasizes high-priced events. [...] In 2009–2010, the theater introduced two discounted ticket programs: a $5 lunchtime series of 45-minute dance performances, and a $10 ticket program for in-person, cash-only purchases in the last 90minutes before performances. [...] Once the pavilion was built, the initial plan was that the lawn seating would be free for all events. An early brochure for the Grant Park Music Festival said [...] "You never need a ticket to attend a concert! The lawn and the general seating section are always admission free." [...] However, when parking garage revenue fell short of estimates during the first year, the city charged $10 for lawn seating at the August 31, 2005, concert by Tori Amos. Amos, a classically trained musician who chose only piano and organ accompaniment for her concert, earned positive reviews as the inaugural rock and roll performer in a venue that regularly hosts classical music. The city justified the charge by contending that since the pavilion is an open-air venue, there were many places in Millennium Park where <b>people</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> enjoyed the music or {{the atmosphere of the}} park without having to pay.|$|E

500|$|By about 00:20, 40minutes {{after the}} collision, the loading of the {{lifeboats}} was under way. Second Officer Lightoller recalled afterwards that he noticed Smith {{standing near the}} bridge {{looking out at the}} ocean in a trance-like daze. According to Lightoller, [...] "I yelled {{at the top of my}} voice, 'Hadn't we better get the women and children into the boats, sir?' He heard me and nodded reply." [...] Smith then ordered Lightoller and Murdoch to [...] "put the women and children in and lower away". Lightoller took charge of the boats on the port side and Murdoch took charge of those on the starboard side. The two officers interpreted the [...] "women and children" [...] evacuation order differently; Murdoch took it to mean women and children first, while Lightoller took it to mean women and children only. Lightoller lowered lifeboats with empty seats if there were no women and children waiting to board, while Murdoch allowed a limited number of men to board if all the nearby women and children had embarked. Neither officer knew how many people could safely be carried in the boats as they were lowered and they both erred on the side of caution by not filling them. They could have been lowered quite safely with their full complement of 68 people, especially with the highly favourable weather and sea conditions. Had this been done, an extra 500 <b>people</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been saved; instead, hundreds of people, predominantly men, were left on board as lifeboats were launched with many seats vacant.|$|E
500|$|Paramount gave Bennett {{the green}} light to write Star Trek III the day after The Wrath of Khan opened, the fastest go-ahead the {{producer}} had received. He began writing the screenplay, noting that [...] "seventeen other <b>people</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> written [...] " [...] after the hints at Spock's resurrection in the previous film. Bennett and Nimoy used the open thread of Spock mind melding with McCoy at the end of The Wrath of Khan as a way to explain Spock's restoration. The idea and name of the Vulcan [...] "katra" [...] came from Bennett's discussions with Nimoy. The actor referred the producer to an episode of the television series, [...] "Amok Time", that suggested to Bennett a high level of [...] "spiritual transference" [...] among the Vulcans. Bennett admitted that the idea of Kirk and company going back to the Genesis planet to recover Kirk's [...] "noble self" [...] stemmed from a poem he read in a Star Trek fan magazine. The film's production acknowledged certain expectations from fans—Nimoy remarked that if Spock had not been resurrected and, instead, [...] "Captain Kirk turn to the camera and [...] 'Sorry, we didn't find him,' people would throw rocks at the screen." [...] A major issue Bennett wrestled with was how to introduce the story for people who had not seen The Wrath of Khan. Bennett said that his television producer mentality [...] "won out"; he added a [...] "previously in Star Trek..." [...] film device, and had Kirk narrate a captain's log, describing his feelings and sense of loss. Aware of the story's predictability, Bennett decided to have the USS Enterprise destroyed, and intended this plot element be kept a secret.|$|E
