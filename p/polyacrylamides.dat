40|$|ABSTRACT. Erosion from furrow {{irrigated}} land {{is a serious}} problem in southern Idaho and elsewhere in the western United States.

In the present work, sediment movement and infiltration were measured in a recirculating furrow infiltrometer with two <b>polyacrylamide</b> treatments.

It is associated with tobacco either as natural component, pyrolysis product in tobacco smoke or additive for one or more types of tobacco products. Glycidamide is formed from acrylamide. Acrylamide is an industrial chemical which is used in several ways, such as production of <b>polyacrylamides</b> for (waste)water treatment, textile, paper processing and cosmetics. It is also a product formed in certain foods prepared at high temperature frying, baking or roasting, such as fried potatoes, bakery products and coffee.

30|$|High {{molecular}} weight <b>polyacrylamides</b> {{are commonly used}} friction reducers in hydraulic fracturing of shale formations. The large volumes of friction reducers (liquid volumes can {{be as high as}} four million gallons for one well), especially synthetic polymers such as <b>polyacrylamides,</b> are difficult to break and are proven to form membranes over shales and are associated with causing fracture and formation damage (Carman and Cawiezel 2007).

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of <b>polyacrylamides,</b> gypsum, and their combination on improving {{the physical and}} chemical properties of a sodic soil was assessed in relation to the response of soybeans to such amelioration procedures. The results of a glasshouse study conducted in the 2002 - 03 summer season, clearly demonstrated that the <b>polyacrylamides</b> used either alone, or combined with gypsum, were effective in the amelioration of a sodic soil. It was also found that there was a significant beneficial effect on grain yield of soybeans when <b>polyacrylamides</b> and gypsum applications were combined. Soybean plants responded positively to such amelioration procedures. The application of <b>polyacrylamides</b> alone (10 kg/ha) increased the grain yield by 15 %, but when combined with gypsum (25 - 100 kg/ha), <b>polyacrylamides</b> increased the grain yield by 22 %. On the other hand, gypsum application alone (25 - 100 kg/ha) increased the grain yield by only 3 %. These findings suggest that sodic soils could be ameliorated with the application of a low quantity of gypsum (25 - 100 kg/ha) combined with <b>polyacrylamides</b> (10 kg/ha). This may have great impact on large-scale reclamation of sodic soils in Australia, and consequently could significantly increase crop production in these soils...|$|E

30|$|Interaction of polymer-containing {{injected}} fluids with shale is {{a widely}} studied phenomenon, but much is still unknown about the interaction of charged <b>polyacrylamides</b> such as anionic and cationic <b>polyacrylamides</b> with shale. The nature of interaction of charged <b>polyacrylamides</b> with shale is not well understood, especially {{from the perspective of}} assessing the potential for <b>polyacrylamides</b> to cause formation damage. Zeta potential and rheological measurements were made for Chattanooga and Pride Mountain shales suspended in polyacrylamide solutions with and without inorganic salts and tetramethyl ammonium chloride (TMAC). The change in zeta potential and viscosity with time was recorded. The magnitude of decrease in the absolute value of zeta potential with time is indicative of adsorption of polymer on the surface of shale and serves as a measure of the extent of polymer interaction with shale. The salts that were used in this study are potassium chloride (KCl), sodium chloride (NaCl). This study quantified the interaction of anionic and cationic polyacrylamide with different North American shales. From the experimental results, it was determined that the <b>polyacrylamides</b> can interact strongly with shale, particularly the cationic polyacrylamide.

40|$|The {{adsorption}} of modified <b>polyacrylamides</b> (PAM) at {{the silica}} surface {{has been studied}} by ellipsometry. To study {{the influence of the}} type of modification of the polyacrylamide on the adsorption behaviour, we have used cationic, anionic and hydrophobically modified <b>polyacrylamides</b> with varying charge density and degree of hydrophobisation. The adsorbed amount and adsorbed layer thickness were obtained at a neutral pH and at a constant ionic strength (C-KCl = 0. 1 M). The effect of surfactant present during the polymerisation process has also been investigated. Cationic modified <b>polyacrylamides</b> have been found to adsorb most strongly onto the silica surface and a large overcompensation of the surface charge has been observed in all cases. For cationic modified <b>polyacrylamides</b> having additional hydrophobic groups the adsorbed amount decreases with density of hy rophobic groups, and the adsorbed layer thickness is larger. Anionic modified <b>polyacrylamides</b> also adsorb onto the negative silica surface, though the adsorbed amounts are small. The presence of the surfactant Tween 80 leads to an increase in the adsorbed amount for the polymers which adsorb weakly {{in the absence of the}} surfactant. However, for the polymers, which have already shown a good ability to adsorb on silica, the addition of surfactant has no significant effect on the adsorbed amount. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V.
