5|$|After the ASTP {{mission was}} completed, Lunney became {{manager of the}} Shuttle Payload Integration and Development Program. During this period, it was {{anticipated}} that NASA's space shuttle fleet would be flying very frequent missions, and carrying commercial <b>payloads</b> as well as flying missions for government {{organizations such as the}} Department of Defense and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The payload integration program was responsible for determining how the various demands of these customers could be satisfied, and how mixed <b>payloads</b> could best be physically accommodated within the cargo bay of the shuttle. During these years Lunney also spent time working at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C., as Deputy Associate Administrator for Space Flight and later as Acting Associate Administrator for Space Transportation Operations.|$|E
5|$|The Shuttle is {{the first}} orbital {{spacecraft}} designed for partial reusability.

40|$|Partitioned <b>Payload</b> system, we call as AnPDPP. AnPDPP is an {{improvement}} to PAYL system {{which is considered}} one of the complete systems for <b>payload</b> based anomaly detection. PAYL takes into consideration the entire <b>payload</b> for profile calculation and effectively for anomaly detection. <b>Payload</b> length is very high on port numbers like 21 and 80.

We use CPP (Content based <b>Payload</b> Partitioning) technique which divides the <b>payload</b> into different partitions depending on content of <b>payload.</b> AnPDPP does <b>payload</b> based anomaly detection using a few CPP partitions. We demonstrate usefulness of the AnPDPP on the 1999 DARPA IDS data set. We observed 97. 06 % accuracy on port 80 using only 62. 64 % packet <b>payload</b> length with small false positive rate.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to experimentally investigate the <b>payload</b> sensitivity of model-based control algorithms for the class of vertically articulated industrial manipulators with high torque amplification drive systems. Once the pay-load sensitivity was established, the minimum subset of <b>payload</b> parameters required to permit <b>payload</b> invariant tracking performance was determined. Analysis of open-loop feedforward compensation torques correctly predicted the experimental PUMA results. High amplification drive sys-tems reduce, but do not eliminate, the <b>payload</b> sensitivity of industrial manipulator dynamics. Model-based controllers must adapt to <b>payload</b> variation in order to maintain high speed tracking accuracy. For a wide range of end-effector <b>payload,</b> the <b>payload</b> estimation/adaptation algorithm for the large positioning links need only compensate for variation in <b>payload</b> mass. To accurately adapt to changes in small link dynamics, the algorithm must estimate both the <b>payload</b> mass and centroid. Knowledge of <b>payload</b> sensitivity can re-duce the complexity of all model-based adaptation schemes and bring them a step closer to routine implementation. 1...|$|R
5|$|In service, Skylon could {{potentially}} {{lower the cost}} of launching satellites which, according to evidence submitted to the UK parliament by REL, is forecast to be around £650/kg; as of 2011, the average launch cost using conventional methods was estimated to be roughly £15,000/kg. Amongst other prospective operations, Skylon would be capable of transporting <b>payloads</b> of up to 10-tonnes to the International Space Station. REL has also completed internal studies into the use of Skylon as a launch platform for a network of space-based solar power satellites, which have been historically unfeasible due to high launch costs.

5|$|Two prototypes {{were lost}} in accidents, both {{of which had been}} {{primarily}} caused by poor piloting decisions and errors leading to two ground collision incidents; a third Tornado prototype was seriously damaged by an incident involving pilot-induced pitch oscillation. During the type's development, aircraft designers of the era were beginning to incorporate features such as more sophisticated stability augmentation systems and autopilots. Aircraft such as the Tornado and the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon made use of these new technologies. Failure testing of the Tornado's triplex analogue command and stability augmentation system (CSAS) was conducted on a series of realistic flight control rigs; the variable-sweep wings in combination with varying, and frequently very heavy, <b>payloads</b> complicated the clearance process.|$|E

5|$|The Skylon is a fully {{reusable}} {{single stage}} to orbit (SSTO) vehicle, {{able to achieve}} orbit without staging, which {{is intended to be}} used principally as a reusable launch system. Proponents of the SSTO approach have often claimed that staging involves a number of inherent complications and problems due to complexity, such as being difficult or typically impossible to recover and reuse most elements, thus unavoidably incurring great expense to produce entirely new launch vehicles instead; therefore, they believe that SSTO designs hold the promise of providing a reduction to the high cost of space flights. Operationally, it is envisioned for the non-crewed Skylon to take off from a specially strengthened runway, gain altitude in a fashion akin to a conventional aeroplane and perform an ascent at very high speeds, in excess of five times the speed of sound (3,800 miles per hour), to attain a peak altitude of roughly 92,000 feet, on the edge of low earth orbit (LEO), where <b>payloads</b> would typically be launched prior to the vehicle's re-entry into the atmosphere, upon which it will conduct a relatively gentle descent before performing a traditional landing upon a runway.|$|E
5|$|The {{historical}} region {{now known}} as China experienced a history involving mechanics, hydraulics and mathematics applied to horology, metallurgy, astronomy, agriculture, engineering, music theory, craftsmanship, naval architecture and warfare. By the Warring States period (403–221 BC), inhabitants of the Warring States had advanced metallurgic technology, including the blast furnace and cupola furnace, while the finery forge and puddling process were known by the Han Dynasty (202 BC–AD 220). A sophisticated economic system in imperial China gave birth to inventions such as paper money during the Song Dynasty (960–1279). The invention of gunpowder during the mid 9th century led to an array of inventions such as the fire lance, land mine, naval mine, hand cannon, exploding cannonballs, multistage rocket and rocket bombs with aerodynamic wings and explosive <b>payloads.</b> With the navigational aid of the 11th century compass and ability to steer at high sea with the 1st century sternpost rudder, premodern Chinese sailors sailed as far as East Africa. In water-powered clockworks, the premodern Chinese had used the escapement mechanism since the 8th century and the endless power-transmitting chain drive in the 11th century. They also made large mechanical puppet theaters driven by waterwheels and carriage wheels and wine-serving automatons driven by paddle wheel boats.|$|E
