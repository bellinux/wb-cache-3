5|$|In 1989, the {{government}} of the Socialist Republic of Croatia decided to tolerate <b>political</b> parties in response to growing demands to allow <b>political</b> activities outside the Communist party. The first <b>political</b> party founded in Croatia {{since the beginning of the}} Communist rule was the Croatian Social Liberal Party (HSLS), established on 20 May 1989, followed by the Croatian Democratic Union on 17 June 1989. In December 1989, Ivica Račan became the head of the reformed Communist party. At the same time, the party cancelled <b>political</b> trials, released <b>political</b> prisoners and endorsed a multi-party <b>political</b> system. The Civil Organisations Act was formally amended to allow <b>political</b> parties on 11 January 1990, legalising the parties that were already founded.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{all members}} of the European Council are members of a <b>political</b> party at {{national}} level, and most of these are members of a European-level <b>political</b> party. These frequently hold pre-meetings of their European Council members, prior to its meetings. However, the European Council is composed to represent the EU's states rather than <b>political</b> parties and decisions are generally made on these lines, though ideological alignment can colour their <b>political</b> agreements and their choice of appointments (such as their president).|$|E
5|$|An Introduction to Animals and <b>Political</b> Theory {{begins by}} {{discussing}} {{the history of}} animals in <b>political</b> theory before considering the approaches taken {{to the status of}} animals by five schools of <b>political</b> theory: utilitarianism, liberalism, communitarianism, Marxism and feminism. The final chapter outlines Cochrane's own approach, which he situates between liberalism and utilitarianism.|$|E
5|$|During {{the campaigns}} of the June 2015 Turkish elections, Agar.io {{was used in}} Turkey as a medium of <b>political</b> advocacy; many players were naming their cells after Turkish <b>political</b> parties and references, with alliances formed between players with similar <b>political</b> views, battling against other players with {{opposing}} views. Some <b>political</b> parties have used Agar.io in campaign posters {{as a symbol of}} support.|$|E

5|$|In part, <b>Political</b> Animals and Animal Politics {{arose from}} a {{workshop}} Wissenburg and Schlosberg organised at the 2012 European Consortium for <b>Political</b> Research Joint Sessions conference, {{though not all}} attendees contributed to the volume and not all contributors presented at the workshop. <b>Political</b> Animals and Animal Politics was published {{as part of the}} Palgrave Macmillan Animal Ethics Series, edited by Andrew Linzey and Priscilla Cohn.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} chapter Cochrane argues that each school has an {{important}} contribution to make to animal justice, particularly liberalism and utilitarianism. He then outlines his own approach. He writes that, while talk of our <b>political</b> and moral obligations to animals is today more prominent than ever, it remains on the periphery of mainstream dialogue in <b>political</b> theory. He closes by arguing that this neglect is a problem for <b>political</b> theory, and that animals are owed justice. If the book's claims are correct, Cochrane concludes, questions concerning the treatment of animals should be considered some of the most pressing <b>political</b> issues today.|$|E

5|$|Pussy Riot's {{performances}} {{can either}} be called dissident art or <b>political</b> action that engages art forms.

5|$|Subsequent <b>political</b> {{developments}} made {{it difficult}} to hold large organised rallies at the site. Catalan <b>political</b> gatherings were banned during the 1923–1930 dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera, travel was difficult during the 1936–1939 Spanish Civil War, and <b>political</b> gatherings were again banned during (and for some time after) the Franco dictatorship of 1939–1975.|$|E

5|$|The {{principle}} of the liberum veto preserved the feudal features of Poland's <b>political</b> system, weakened {{the role of the}} monarchy, led to anarchy in <b>political</b> life, and contributed to the economic and <b>political</b> decline of the Polish state. Such a situation made the country vulnerable to foreign invasions and ultimately led to its collapse.|$|E
5|$|The whole {{trial was}} seen {{by some as a}} <b>political</b> trial, {{inspired}} by the Belgian establishment. The federal parliament had notably amended the Constitution in order to create legal possibilities to condemn the party.

25|$|Easton’s {{principal}} research {{interest is}} in elaborating a systems analytical approach as a central means of understanding how <b>political</b> systems operate.

This study concentrates on <b>political</b> changes regarding casual <b>political</b> changes, for example, changes in <b>political</b> talks, and changes in the <b>political</b> procedures of the decision administration. Formal <b>political</b> changes, for example, the democratization of organized <b>political</b> framework, are yet to have critical effect on social developments, {{in spite of the fact}} that measures are presently being taken, for example, the abolishment of the Internal Security Act (ISA), beginning on 16 September 2011, and the foundation of an extraordinary board of trustees on appointive change.|$|E

25|$|Easton’s book The <b>Political</b> System {{drove home}} {{the failure of}} 1950s <b>political</b> science to build {{anything}} resembling coherent theories of politics or to develop systematic techniques for gathering and analyzing data, with which such theories might be constructed. The most widely known and used definition of politics was provided by Easton in his identification of the <b>political</b> system with the “authoritative allocation of values for a society.” This provided many <b>political</b> scientists with a useful guideline for delimiting the content of <b>political</b> science.|$|E
25|$|In the 20th century, {{the study}} of ideology, behaviouralism and {{international}} relations led to a multitude of 'pol-sci' subdisciplines including rational choice theory, voting theory, game theory (also used in economics), psephology, <b>political</b> geography/geopolitics, <b>political</b> psychology/political sociology, <b>political</b> economy, policy analysis, public administration, comparative <b>political</b> analysis and peace studies/conflict analysis.|$|E
25|$|A <b>political</b> {{commander}} (zampolit) {{served as}} a <b>political</b> commissar of the armed forces. A zampolit supervised party organizations and conducted party <b>political</b> work within a military unit. He lectured troops on Marxism–Leninism, the Soviet view of international affairs, and the party's tasks for the armed forces. During World War II the zampolit lost veto authority over the commander's decisions but retained the power {{to report to the}} next highest <b>political</b> officer or organization on the <b>political</b> attitudes and performance of the unit's commander.|$|E
25|$|Acemoglu and Robinson {{counter that}} their theory distinguishes between <b>political</b> and {{economic}} institutions {{and that it}} is not <b>political</b> institutions that contribute to growth directly but economic institutions shaped by the <b>political</b> institutions. In the case of China, even though the <b>political</b> institutions on a higher level are far from inclusive, the incentive to reform Chinese economy does come from <b>political</b> institutions; in 1978 from Deng Xiaoping's Opening up policy {{at the end of the}} internal <b>political</b> feud during the Cultural Revolution. This exactly fits into the theory that the change in <b>political</b> institutions has shaped economic institutions and thus has influenced economic performance. This economic growth is further expected to shape the <b>political</b> institutions in China in the future. One can only say that China is an outlier to the theory when in the future China becomes as wealthy as U.S. or Germany but still remains an authoritarian regime.|$|E

25|$|In 1974, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions {{was ranked}} {{as the second}} most {{frequently}} used book in <b>political</b> science courses focused on scope and methods.

The book also proved popular with <b>political</b> scientists embroiled in debates about whether a set of formulations put forth by a <b>political</b> scientists constituted a theory, or something else.|$|E
