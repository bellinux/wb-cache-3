40|$|Algorithms {{currently}} have direct implications in our democracies and societies, {{but they also}} define mostly all our daily activities as users, defining our decisions and promoting different behaviors. In this context, {{it is necessary to}} define and think about how to design the different implications that these algorithms have from a user centered perspective, particularly in social media platforms that have such relevance in our information sources and flow. Therefore, the current thesis provides an introduction to the concept of algorithmic experience, trying to study how to implement it for social media services in cellphone devices. Using a Research through Design methodology supported by interface analysis, document analysis and user design workshops, the present paper provides results grouped in five different areas: algorithmic <b>profiling</b> <b>transparency,</b> algorithmic <b>profiling</b> management, algorithmic awareness, algorithmic user-control and selective algorithmic remembering. These five areas provide a framework capable of promoting requirements and guide the evaluation of algorithmic experience in social media contexts...|$|R

The main {{contribution}} {{of this work}} 1 is the comparison of dif-ferent techniques for representing user preferences extracted by analyzing data gathered from social networks, {{with the aim of}} constructing more transparent (human-readable) and serendipitous user profiles. We com-pared two different user models representations: one based on keywords and one exploiting encyclopedic knowledge extracted from Wikipedia. A preliminary evaluation involving 51 Facebook and Twitter users has shown that the use of an encyclopedic-based representation better re-flects user preferences, and helps to introduce new interesting topics. 1 Motivation and Research Problem In this work we investigate whether a Wikipedia-based representation of user interests allows to produce more transparent and serendipitous user <b>profiles.</b> <b>Transparency</b> is related to the readability of profiles, while serendipity to the ability to suggest surprisingly interesting items that users might not have oth-erwise discovered. The main motivation for this reseach is that a system that adopts a more understandable representation can lead towards a more trans-parent personalization process. For example, a recommender system that uses a human-understandable profile could easily explain the reason for a sugges-tion. Furthermore, serendipitous profiles help to overcome the overspecialization problem, that leads to accurate but obvious (and so unuseful) suggestions. We address the following two research questions: – Are Wikipedia concepts (i. e., titles of Wikipedia articles) more representative than keywords for modeling user interests? – Is it possible to leverage encyclopedic knowledge to enrich user profiles with novel topics of interest...|$|R

Excess of nutrients inflow have contributed to the eutrophic conditions and the internal recycling of nutrients from sediments during water circulation has resulted in luxurious growth of phytoplankton. The lake is thus anoxic and has reduced hypolimnion, winter circulation, large phytoplankton and relatively lower animal population.|$|R

40|$|We {{present an}} imaging {{technique}} {{that allows the}} recovery of the <b>transparency</b> <b>profile</b> of wavelength-scale objects with deep subwavelength resolution based on far-field intensity measurements. The approach, interscale mixing microscopy (IMM), relies on diffractive element positioned in the near-field proximity to the object, to scatter information carried by evanescent waves into propagating part of the spectrum. A combination of numerical solutions of Maxwell equations and nonlinear fitting is then used to recover the information about the object based on far-field intensity measurements. The potential of the developed formalism to recover wavelength/ 20 features of wavelength-scale objects in presence of up to 10 % noise is demonstrated. Comment: 9 pages 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|Aimed at {{protection}} {{of the market and}} consumers, the control of solvency is very important for insurer’s business activities. Regarding the fact that insurer’s insolvency causes a chain of problems, the state regulation is needed that forces insurers to keep their solvency at the necessary level. Insurance companies in the European Union work on the implementation of a new regulatory framework defined by the Solvency II Directive, which demands a better risk management as well as a better connection of capital and risk <b>profile,</b> increased <b>transparency,</b> and higher flexibility of insurance companies’ business. In the period to come, this would present a huge challenge for the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) as well, which would need to prepare their resources for the introduction of the Solvency II concept. For this purpose, the analysis of the current condition of the insurance market in BiH was made. By using the primary research and applying the survey as a questioning technique, the attitudes were gathered on the current conditions and possibilities for the implementation of the Solvency II Directive into the business activities of insurance companies in BiH...|$|R

40|$|An {{understanding}} of how software is employed in the field can yield many opportunities for quality improvements. Profiling released software can provide such an understanding. However, profiling released software is di#cult due to the potentially large number of deployed sites that must be <b>profiled,</b> the extreme <b>transparency</b> expectations, and the remote data collection and deployment management process. Researchers have recently proposed various approaches {{to tap into the}} opportunities and overcome those challenges. Initial studies have illustrated the application of these approaches and have shown their feasibility. Still, the promising proposed approaches, and the tradeo#s between overhead, accuracy, and potential benefits for the testing activity have been barely quantified. This paper aims to overcome those limitations. Our analysis of 1200 user sessions on a 155 KLOC system substantiates the ability of field data to support test suite improvements, quantifies di#erent approaches previously introduced in isolation, and assesses the e#ciency of profiling techniques for released software and the e#ectiveness of their associated testing e#orts...|$|R
40|$|The Oregon Lake Watch (OLW) {{volunteer}} {{monitoring program}} was resurrected after {{over a decade}} in hibernation. The new program was designed {{to educate the public}} about threats of aquatic invasive species (AIS), provide early detection of AIS invasions, and provide long term water quality data for the better management of Oregon’s lakes and reservoirs. Protocols were created for citizen scientists to survey for AIS, collect temperature and water clarity data, and record the data through an online data entry portal. An OLW website was developed to educate about AIS and provide survey protocols and identification materials to volunteers. AIS surveys were focused on Watch List Species which are selected AIS that {{have a negative impact on}} the beneficial uses of our waterbodies. Eighteen volunteers were trained during five sessions conducted in western and central Oregon. Fourteen of the trained volunteers collected data from sixteen waterbodies. Six Watch List species and one other AIS species were observed in four of the waterbodies. The three Watch List Species observed in Salish Pond and one in Olallie Lake were new observations.

40|$|Data {{aggregators}} collect {{large amount}} of information about individual users and create detailed online behavioral profiles of individuals. Behavioral profiles benefit users by improving products and services. However, they have also raised concerns regarding user privacy, transparency of collection practices and accuracy of data in the <b>profiles.</b> To improve <b>transparency,</b> some companies are allowing users to access their behavioral profiles. In this work, we investigated behavioral profiles of users by utilizing these access mechanisms. Using in-person interviews (n= 8), we analyzed the data shown in the profiles, elicited user concerns, and estimated accuracy of profiles. We confirmed our interview findings via an online survey (n= 100). To assess the claim of improving transparency, we compared data shown in profiles with the data that companies have about users. More than 70 % of the participants expressed concerns about collection of sensitive data such as credit and health information, level of detail and how their data may be used. We found a large gap between the data shown in profiles and the data possessed by companies. A large number of profiles were inaccurate with as much as 80 % inaccuracy. We discuss implications for public policy management. Comment: in Ashwini Rao, Florian Schaub, and Norman Sadeh What do they know about me?

40|$|Using {{an active}} grid in a wind tunnel, we {{generate}} homogeneous shear turbulence and initiate turbulent boundary layers with adjustable properties. Homogeneous shear turbulence {{is characterized by}} a constant gradient of the mean velocity and a constant turbulence intensity. It is the simplest anisotropic turbulent flow thinkable, and it is generated traditionally by equipping a wind tunnel with screens which have a varying transparency and flow straighteners. This is not done easily, and the reachable turbulence levels are modest. We describe a new technique for generating homogeneous shear turbulence using an active grid only. Our active grid consists of a grid of rods with attached vanes which can be rotated by servo motors. We control the grid by prescribing the time-dependent angle of each axis. We tune the vertical <b>transparency</b> <b>profile</b> of the grid by setting appropriate angles of each rod such as to generate a uniform velocity gradient, and set the rods in flapping motion around these angles to tailor the turbulence intensity. The Taylor Reynolds number reached was R ¿ = 870, the shear rate S = ¿U/¿y = 9. 2 s- 1, the nondimensional shear parameter S *= Sq 2 /e = 12 and u = 1. 4 ms- 1. As a further application of this idea we demonstrate the generation of a simulated atmospheric boundary layer in a wind tunnel which has tunable properties. This method offers a great advantage over the traditional one, in which vortex-generating structures need to be placed in the wind tunnel to initiate a fat boundary layer...|$|R
40|$|International audienceHomodimers {{of noble}} metal nanocubes form model {{plasmonic}} systems where the localized plasmon resonances sustained by each particle not only hybridize but also coexist with excitations {{of a different}} nature: surface plasmon polaritons confined within the Fabry−Perot cavity delimited by facing cube surfaces (i. e., gap plasmons). Destructive interference in the strong coupling between one of these highly localized modes and the highly radiating longitudinal dipolar plasmon of the dimer {{is responsible for the}} formation of a Fano resonance profile and the opening of a spectral window of anomalous transparency for the exciting light. We report on the clear experimental evidence of this effect in the case of 50 nm silver and 160 nm gold nanocube dimers studied by spatial modulation spectroscopy at the single particle level. A numerical study based on a plasmon mode analysis leads us to unambiguously identify the main cavity mode involved in this process and especially the major role played by its symmetry. The Fano depletion dip is red-shifted when the gap size is decreasing. It is also blue-shifted and all the more pronounced that the cube edge rounding is large. Combining nanopatch antenna and plasmon hybridization descriptions, we quantify the key role of the face-to-face distance and the cube edge morphology on the spectral <b>profile</b> of the <b>transparency</b> dip. T he optical excitation of localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPR) in single metallic nanoparticles or multicomponent nanostructures is responsible for efficient resonant far-field scattering and near-field concentration of light. 1, 2 Such nanoantennas offer the opportunity to manipulate light at scales much shorter than the wavelength by making the best use of the LSPR sensitivity to variations in particle shape, size, chemical composition, and dielectric environment. 3, 4 The electrostatic coupling between several plasmonic subunits is an additional tool for tailoring the optical response over a wide spectral range. 5, 6 In this respect, much attention is paid to analogues of Fano resonances in classical electrostatics and especially those arising from the coupling between a " dark " plasmonic mode (weak dipole moment and narrow line width) and a degenerate mode that is highly radiative over a much broader spectral range (" bright " mode, large dipole moment). On either side of the resonance, the rapid phase shift of the " dark " mode polarizability relative to that of the bright mode and the exciting field may induce constructive or destructive interference in the net far field scattering process. They result in the formation of a dip in the broad spectral band of the far field scattered light with a typical dissymmetric profile and a narrow width related to the " dark " resonance lifetime. 7 − 11 Fano resonances open sharp and transparent windows in the plasmonic response of metallic nanostructures. 12 − 14 Their high sensitivity to relative changes in the nanostructure dielectric environment can be efficiently exploited for chemical and biological sensing. 15, 16 Most of the studies in this field deal with noble metal nanoantennas built from the assembly and coupling of subunits of various size, shape, and orientation: oligomers of colloidal particles (DNA assembled, 17, 18 heterodimers 19) and predominantly objects engraved by electron-beam lithography. 20 − 22 This method offers considerable flexibility for designing the spectral response of intricate structures with an advantageous symmetry breaking. 13, 23 In the far field, they act as wide ban...|$|R
