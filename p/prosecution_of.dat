5|$|An Army report {{released}} in 2001 blamed {{the breakdown of}} the 65th on the following factors: a shortage of officers and noncommissioned officers, a rotation policy that removed combat-experienced leaders and soldiers, tactics that led to high casualties, an ammunition shortage, communication problems between largely white, English-speaking officers and Spanish-speaking Puerto Rican enlisted men, and declining morale. The report also found bias in the <b>prosecution</b> <b>of</b> the Puerto Ricans, citing instances of continental soldiers who were not charged after refusing to fight in similar circumstances, before and after Jackson Heights.|$|E

On 21 August, at Van Wyk's Vlei, Sergeant Hampton and Corporal Knight held their positions and evacuated wounded mounted Kingsmen under heavy fire, {{for which they}} received the Victoria Cross. Two days later, Boer forces attacked the 1st Battalion while {{it was at the}} forefront of an advance south of Dalmanutha.

5|$|During the 1906 {{legislative}} session, Beckham urged {{investigation and}} <b>prosecution</b> <b>of</b> corrupt insurance companies, {{following the lead}} of New York attorney Charles Evans Hughes. In particular, he recommended reducing the practice of deferred dividends, which allowed the insurance companies to keep large stores of cash on-hand for illegal purposes. He further advocated that insurance companies doing business in the state be required to invest a certain percentage of their earnings in Kentucky, bolstering the its economy and providing policyholders some protection against fraud.|$|E

5|$|Generally, {{time was}} {{on the side of}} the defenders; most armies could not afford to wait out the <b>prosecution</b> <b>of</b> a siege, {{especially}} of a well-fortified, well-provisioned city. Until the invention of gunpowder-based weapons (and the resulting higher-velocity projectiles), the balance of power and logistics definitely favored the defender. With the introduction of large-caliber mortars and howitzers (in modern times), the traditional methods of defense became less effective against a determined siege, although many of the trace italienne fortresses presented a formidable challenge well into the twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|Several {{times in}} 1912, amidst an {{outbreak}} of bubonic plague in the Caribbean, Havana operated in violation of Cuban and U.S. quarantine rules. In July 1912, the liner prepared to depart Cuba without an inspection and fumigation, but faced the prospect of seven days quarantine in Havana before the ship {{would be allowed to}} depart. However, a compromise was worked out by the United States Marine Hospital Service which allowed Havana to depart after a one-day delay. In September of the same year, another inspection gaffe resulted in government <b>prosecution</b> <b>of</b> the Ward Line.|$|E

Rajneesh's personal secretary and second-in-command, Ma Anand Sheela (Sheela Silverman), assembled the group after Turner was appointed to investigate illegal activity at Rajneeshpuram.

5|$|The Allies {{established}} occupation administrations in Austria and Germany. The former {{became a}} neutral state, non-aligned with any political bloc. The latter {{was divided into}} western and eastern occupation zones controlled by the Western Allies and the USSR, accordingly.

The two California affiliates, in particular, felt the national ACLU headquarters was not supporting civil liberties strongly enough, and they initiated more cold war cases than the national headquarters did.|$|E
