Tais compostos são amplamente distribuídos no meio ambiente e associados a partículas atmosféricas. O objetivo do presente estudo foi identificar os grupos funcionais dos NPAHs associados ao PM 1. 0 por espectroscopia de infravermelho termal com transformada de Fourier (FTIR – Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy), determinar a concentração de tais compostos e avaliar a sazonalidade em uma área de influência veicular na região Metropolitana de Porto Alegre (MAPA – Metropolitan Area of Porto Alegre). Além disso, estudaram-se variáveis meteorológicas e outros poluentes (NO, NO 2, NOx, O 3) com a finalidade de relacioná-los com os NPAHs. Partículas atmosféricas (PM 1. 0) foram coletadas usando filtros de <b>PTFE</b> (<b>polytetrafluorethylene)</b> no amostrador automático PM 162 M. Após, o espectrorradiômetro FTIR portátil, da Designs & Prototypes, modelo 102, foi utilizado para realizar medidas espectrais de transmitância e emissividade dos padrões sólidos dos NPAHs: 1 -NP e 2 -NF e das amostras de partículas atmosféricas. As análises por cromatografia gasosa com detecção por captura de elétrons (GC-ECD - {{gas chromatography}} with electron capture detector) foram precedidas por isolamento/derivação, sendo essas as técnicas de determinação e extração, respectivamente, de NHPAs (1 -NNa, 2 -NF, 3 -NFl, 1 -NP e 6 -NChr) associados a PM 1. 0. Para validar o método analítico foi usado o Material de Referência Padrão – SRM 1649 b – do National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, USA). As análises espectrais resultantes de transmitância e emissividade apresentaram bons resultados, possibilitando identificar as ligações C-N e grupo NO 2, assim como alguns grupos funcionais orgânicos característicos dos padrões 1 -NP e 2 -NF, indicando que este método pode ser aplicado no material particulado atmosférico. Com o método empregado foi possível identificar o 1 -NP em todas as amostras, enquanto que 2 -NF foi identificado apenas em Canoas 1 e Sapucaia do Sul 1 e 2. As concentrações de NPAHs foram mais elevadas no inverno e Sapucaia do Sul foi o local que apresentou maiores níveis destes compostos, exceto o 6 -NChr. Os NPAHs associados a PM 1. 0 mostraram correlações com os poluentes óxidos de nitrogênio (NO e NOx), assim como NPAHs com as variáveis meteorológicas: temperatura e velocidade do vento. Os resultados indicaram a contribuição dos veículos com motores a diesel. Isto foi confirmado pelo estudo das razões NPAHs/PAHs, 1 -NP/Py, 6 -NChr/Chr. The nitro-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (NPAHs) are organic compounds that {{consisting of two}} or more benzene rings linked by a nitro group (NO 2). These compounds are widely distributed in the environment and are mainly found associated with atmospheric particles. The objective {{of this study was to}} identify the functional groups of NPAHs associated with PM 1. 0 by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), determine the concentration of these compounds and evaluate the seasonality in an area of vehicular influence in the Metropolitan area of Porto Alegre (MAPA). Summed to that, meteorological variables and other pollutants (NO, NO 2, NOx, O 3) were studied in order to relate them with the NPAHs. Atmospheric particles (PM 1. 0) were collected using <b>PTFE</b> (<b>polytetrafluorethylene)</b> filters in autosampler PM 162 M. After that, the portable spectroradiometer FTIR, model 102 of Designs & Prototypes, was used for spectral measurements of transmittance and emissivity of solid standards of NPAHs: 1 -NP and 2 -NF and the atmospheric particles samples. Analyses by gas chromatography with electron capture detector (GC-ECD) were preceded by isolation / derivation, those being the determination and extraction techniques, respectively, of NHPAs (1 -NNa, 2 -NF, 3 -NFl, 1 -NP and 6 -NChr) associated with PM 1. 0. To validate the analytical method it was used the Standard Reference Material - SRM 1649 b - of National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, USA). The spectral analysis resulting of transmittance and emissivity showed good results, allowing to identify the CN bands and NO 2 group, as well as some characteristic organic functional groups of 1 -NP and 2 -NF standards, indicating that this method can be applied in atmospheric particulate matter. With the employed method it was possible to identify the 1 -NP in all samples, while the 2 -NF was identified only in Canoas 1 and Sapucaia do Sul 1 and 2. The NPAHs concentrations were higher in winter and Sapucaia do Sul was the place that had the highest levels of these compounds, except to 6 -NChr. The NPAHs associated with the PM 1. 0 showed correlations with the nitrogen oxides (NO and NOx) pollutants, as the NPAHs with the meteorological variables: temperature and wind speed.

50|$|Hernia {{surgery is}} one of the most common current {{applications}} of surgical mesh. Hernias occur when organs or fatty tissue bulge through openings or debilitated areas of muscle, usually in the abdominal wall. Surgical mesh is implanted to strengthen tissue repair and minimize the rate of recurrence.

Materials:Thirty-one patients presented with 33 episodes of graft thrombosis. Chief outcome measures:Successful thrombolysis in terms of total clearance or sufficient clearance to reveal an underlying factor responsible for graft failure. Main results:Thrombolysis was successful in seven of 10 suprainguinal grafts (4 of 5 rtPA; 3 of 5 SK). One patient had failed lysis requiring an ilio-femoral graft. Of the seven patients with successful lysis, one required revision of a proximal anastomosis, two required distal anastomotic revisions, and one rethrombosed. Twenty-three thrombosed infrainguinal grafts were managed initially with intraarterial thrombolysis (9 rtPA, 14 SK). Of 27 patients surviving at 30 days, seven required major amputation despite aggressive intervention.

Initial clean solution fluxes 5 – 6 L/m 2 /h declined to less than half during short 40 % water recovery tests for all stick water samples. Fish stick water uniquely showed reduced fouling and up to 78 % water recovery. Lost flux was easily restored by rinsing the membrane with clean water. MMF prior to MD removed 92 % of fats, facilitating superior MD performance. Differences in fouling between stick waters were attributed to temperature polarisation from higher melt temperature fats and relative proportions to proteins.

40|$|Gas {{diffusion}} electrodes for electrochemical devices frequently {{consist of}} <b>polytetrafluorethylene</b> (<b>PTFE)</b> and are carbon black supported catalysts. The hydrophilic and hydrophobic character determines the moisturewetting wetting behavior, {{which is important}} for the media transports in the gas diffusion electrodes. The main components of gas diffusion electrodes are an organic binder, typical PTFE, and a catalyst, for applications with acid electrolyte a noble metal catalyst, which frequently is supported by carbon black. The chemical surface composition of electrodes prepared in different ways from a mixture of carbon black and PTFE and mechanically and thermally modified were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS measurements show differences between electrodes wet prepared from a suspension and electrodes prepared with the dry preparation technique of the DLR (Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt). During the preparation of the electrodes by the dry preparation technique the carbon black is enriched on the surface. Due to the mechanical stressing the enrichment of the carbon black is reduced. By tempering the PTFE concentration on the surface can be increased. The results of the XPS measurements were related to the wetting behavior; a concentration of approximately 20 weight% (wt%) PTFE is the limit between hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-two {{high-density}} polyethylene sockets from Charnley low-friction arthroplasties have been studied. Acrylic casts and shadowgraph techniques {{were used to}} measure both the real and radiographic rates of wear; these rates showed a significant correlation. In the sagittal plane, nine of the sockets had worn lateral to a line drawn vertically from the centre of curvature of the socket, 12 had worn medial to that line and only one was worn exactly in the line. In the coronal plane, nine sockets had worn {{in front of a}} similar vertical line, two behind that line and 1 1 had worn exactly in the line. Evidence of impingement of the neck of the stem onto the rim of the socket was found in 14 patients; this is considered {{to be one of the}} causes of socket loosening. The obvious solution is to reduce the diameter of the neck of the stem from 12. 5 mmto 10 mm;provided that it is made of cold-formed, high nitrogen-content stainless steel, this narrower neck is strong enough not to fracture. <b>Polytetrafluorethylene</b> (<b>PTFE),</b> the first plastic used for the socket in total hip arthroplasty, was abandoned because of rapid wear and adverse tissue reaction (Charnley 1963). A later study ofPTFE sockets removed at revision surgery established that the wear did not tak...|$|E
