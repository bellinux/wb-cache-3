40|$|M. Sc. Thesis {{discusses}} the tolling {{system in the}} free-flow <b>for</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> vehicles in the Republic of Slovenia. From activities taken we can conclude {{that in the next}} years electronic toll collection system will become functional, initially only <b>for</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> vehicles and in the next phase also for passenger cars. Introduction of electronic toll collection system in the free-flow will from technical point of view open way to many possibilities that such a system can provide in addition to its primary purpose - the tolling of vehicles. M. Sc. Thesis focuses on logistics in freight transport by road, on improvement of the supply chain management and on freight optimization which this technology will enable. Road safety is also important issue. In addition to the activities on electronic toll collection in free-flow exercised by the Republic of Slovenia, the important fact is that on the international level the European Union is building a global satellite navigation system Galileo. One of the objectives of this M. Sc. Thesis is to consider the interests of all actors involved to determine what options may be used to upgrade the electronic toll system <b>for</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> vehicles and what possibilities the system's technical characteristics will allow. In this context the M. Sc. Thesis also presents the planned applications of the European satellite navigation system Galileo...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAn {{introduction}} of a kilometer tax <b>for</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> vehicles can be constrained by the risk of that higher production costs than competitors in other countries will negatively affect regions and industries of policy concern. We estimate factor demand elasticities in the Swedish manufacturing industry using firm level data for the 1990 - 2001 period on input prices and quantities. The {{results show that the}} {{introduction of}} a kilometer tax <b>for</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> vehicles decreases transport demand and increases labor demand. The effects are less pronounced in terms of changes in output, though some industries (e. g. wood, and pulp- and paper) can be expected to be affected more than others due to their dependence on road freight transport. The regional dimension regarding the consequences of a kilometer tax seems to be small or even non-existing...|$|R

50|$|Due to the {{hilly terrain}} and {{passing through the}} {{constrained}} streets through Cleobury Mortimer and Clee Hill Village, it is sometimes quicker (and more fuel efficient, especially <b>for</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> vehicles) to take the A456 and A49 (i.e. via Woofferton) instead, if travelling between Bewdley and Ludlow; these two A roads are designated primary routes, whilst the A4117 is not.|$|R

50|$|Each tube {{of the old}} tunnel {{was only}} wide enough to {{accommodate}} two lanes of traffic (with no hard shoulder). As traffic volumes rose, the tunnel became a bottleneck, especially <b>for</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> vehicles. Traffic jams were not so much caused by the restriction to two lanes as the steep approach to the tunnel. Vehicles approaching from the north had to overcome a 6 per cent ascent. Lorries slowed significantly before reaching the tunnel causing long tailbacks.|$|R

50|$|The {{interior}} of British Columbia around the upper Fraser River was called New Caledonia (Canada). Goods were carried from Fort Chipewyan up the Peace River (1,500 foot elevation gain {{and only one}} significant portage at Hudson Hope, British Columbia) to Fort McLeod and carried over the mountains. It normally took two years <b>for</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> to cross the continent, goods being stored at Fort Chipewyan over the winter.

25|$|Transport to {{the island}} is {{provided}} by C-130 Hercules military transport planes operated by the Royal Norwegian Air Force that land at Jan Mayensfield's gravel runway. The planes fly in from Bodø Main Air Station eight times a year.

50|$|Fickleshole {{is mainly}} used for farming, with stables home to over eighty horses. Fickleshole was {{established}} in the early sixteenth century. As nearby New Addington to the northeast has been served by Tramlink, Fickleshole is relatively close to a good public transport system. Roads leading to the hamlet are very narrow with passing places, based on the old roads as used by horse and carts. Many of the roads are unsuitable <b>for</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> vehicles. The White Bear public house, with its white bear sculpture outside, is the main landmark of the hamlet.|$|R
50|$|Gölsdorf became {{especially}} {{well known as}} a result of his inventing the radially-sliding coupled axle for steam locomotives, the so-called Gölsdorf axle. The first engine to be equipped with this was an eight-coupled steam locomotive in 1897, the Class 170. The ten-coupled Class 180, whose first, third and fifth axles were able to slide sideways in the frame, demonstrated that, in almost all cases, locomotives with multi-part frames and complicated articulated designs would be superfluous. From that time forward this type of construction became the standard <b>for</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> locomotives.|$|R

40|$|Implementing {{the road}} {{transport}} directive <b>for</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> vehicle drivers in March 2005 could jeopardise sustainable road delivery systems if less productive drivers and rolling equipment ensue. An {{investigation of the}} impact perceived by the Dutch road haulage industry tested eight hypotheses in an instrument distributed electronically. The current driver shortage was expected to worsen, and additional drivers will incur additional operating costs. Where few customers will fund cost increases, historically low returns on investment will demand fundamental changes in transport operating systems. Small firms, international operators and the physical environment are at risk. ...|$|R
