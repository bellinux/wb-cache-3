We formulate their credit risk in a reduced form model and the dynamics of the spot price in a completely random generalized jump-diffusion model, which nests a number of important models in finance. We obtain a closed-form price for the vulnerable option by (1) determining an equivalent martingale measure, using the Esscher transform and (2) manipulating the <b>pay-off</b> <b>structure</b> of the option four further times, by using the Esscher-Girsanov transform...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{points to}} a deeper {{understanding}} of reciprocity as the outcome of social learning which takes place between two players of the Centipede. The experimental design consists of a Trust Game followed by a Centipede Game, as this latter's environment of strategic interaction is a sort of multi-stage Trust Game and the former a one-stage Trust Game. Results indicate that the level of cooperation is sensitive to the <b>pay-off</b> <b>structure</b> (this effect being stronger when players are aware of the opponents' social preferences), that heterogeneous pairs are more cooperative, and that sefish subjects modify their behavior whenever they perceive that to trust their partners is both possible and worthwhile...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} {{increased}} interest in the effects of internal communication on decision processes. A number of hypotheses relating the bias in information to the final decision have been proposed. In this paper we discuss two laboratory experiments which were designed to test two such hypotheses. The first experiment tests the hypothesis that cost and sales estimations are made with the implicit assumption that a biased <b>pay-off</b> <b>structure</b> exists. The second experiment tests explicitly the effects of biased and unbiased pay-off structures on estimation within an organization. An analysis of the data for the two experiments is made and some implications for further research are drawn from the results. ...|$|E
40|$|The credit {{crisis of}} 2007 - 2009 can be partly {{explained}} by the perverse incentives provided by both income and tax policies. Income policies {{have been designed to}} address the principal-agent problem but have ended up giving a strong incentive to maximize short term profits. Combined with asymetric <b>pay-off</b> <b>structures,</b> it led to risk-lover behaviors that turned to be detrimental to the organizations and their stakeholders. Tax policies have promoted indebtness through the tax deductibility of interest charges for coroporations and of mortgage for households. Differences in tax treatment have also led to the substitution of more lightly taxed stock options and capital gains to regular remunerations. A side effect of this arbitrage has been to reinforce risk-taking behaviors. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} {{reveals that}} hedge fund returns exhibit {{a range of}} different,possibly non-linear pay-off patterns. It is difficult to qualify all these patternssimultaneously as being rational in a traditional framework for optimal financial decisionmaking. In this paper we present a simple model based on loss aversion that can accommodatefor all of these <b>pay-off</b> <b>structures</b> in one unifying framework. We provide evidence thatloss-aversion is a likely assumption for management as well as investor preferences. Following the current empirical literature, we solve a static asset allocation problem thatincludes a nonlinear instrument. We show analytically that four different pay-off functionsmay be rationally optimal. The key parameter in determining which of these four to choosein a specific setting, is the financial planner's surplus. The notion of surplus connectshedge fund manager's incentive schemes {{with the idea of}} mental accounting as proposed inrecent behavioral finance research. hedge funds; performance measurement; loss aversion; behavioral finance...|$|R
40|$|Altruistic {{punishment}} {{has been}} shown to invade when rare if individuals are allowed to opt out of cooperative ventures. Individuals that opt out do not contribute to the common enterprise or derive benefits from it. This result is potentially significant because it offers an explanation for the origin of large-scale cooperation in one-shot interactions among unrelated individuals. Here, we show that this result is not a general consequence of optional participation in cooperative activities, but depends on special assumptions about cooperative pay-offs. We extend the <b>pay-off</b> <b>structure</b> of optional participation models to consider the effects of economies and diseconomies of scale in public-goods production, rival and non-rival consumption of goods, and different orderings of the pay-offs of freeriding and opting out. This more general model highlights the kinds of pay-offs for which optional participation favours cooperation, and those in which it does not...|$|E
40|$|Wild Atlantic salmon are {{traditionally}} harvested {{from both the}} sea and spawning rivers during spawning runs. From an economic point of view, the return from sport fishing in rivers is several times higher than marine ‘for meat only’ harvests. This situation calls for a side payment regime where river owners pay marine fishermen not to fish, and where both parties gain. This paper argues that the reason why such side payment regimes are rarely seen, despite the obvious mutual gain, {{is due to the}} potential free-riding incentives among river owners. Although it is shown that the decision each river owner faces can be described as a game of chicken, taking the stochastic ecology into account may reveal a different <b>pay-off</b> <b>structure.</b> It is also demonstrated that the stochastic ecology of salmon, combined with price rigidities in the rivers, may explain the lack of side payment regimes. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{efficient}} energymanagement framework in {{wireless sensor networks}} (WSNs) to address the fundamental research challenge imposed by both {{the maintenance of the}} energy supply and the support of the quality-of-information (QoI) requirements. By quantifying the QoI benefit the tasks receive in relation to the level of QoI they request as the QoI satisfaction index), we propose a QoIaware energy-management scheme to distributedly decide the participating state of each sensor. Specifically, by using the mathematical framework of the Gur Game, we propose a novel <b>pay-off</b> <b>structure</b> taking into account the QoI and the energy consumption. We finally evaluate the proposed scheme under an event occurrence detection scenario, where the proposed scheme successfully guarantees less than 7 % QoI outage, saves 80 % of the energy reserve if compared with the lower bound solution, and achieves the suboptimum with only 4 % gap if compared with optimal solution.

40|$|I {{construct}} index-based weather {{insurance contracts}} with optimal hedging effectiveness for the insured or maximal {{profits for the}} insurer. In contrast to earlier work, I refrain from imposing functional form assumptions on the stochastic relationship between weather and yield and from restricting attention to (piecewise) linear contracts. Instead, I derive {{the shape of the}} optimal weather insurance contracts empirically by non-parametrically estimating yield distributions conditional on weather. I find that the optimal <b>pay-off</b> <b>structure</b> is non-linear for the entire range of weather realizations. I measure risk reduction of optimal weather insurance contracts for different weather indices and levels of risk aversion. Considering profit-maximizing contracts, I find that at modest levels of risk aversion (coefficient of relative risk aversion around 2), a loading factor of 10 % of the fair premium is possible such that the insurance contract remains attractive for the insured. With higher levels of risk aversion, loading of more than 50 % becomes possible. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{study the}} {{derivatives}} {{use by the}} most popular unit trusts among domestic equity and fixed interest categories in the UK between July 2004 and June 2007. As investors love winning trusts that have good performance, {{the objective of this}} paper is to investigate whether winning trusts employ derivatives more and what determine their derivatives usage. Moreover, due to the non-linear <b>pay-off</b> <b>structure</b> of derivatives and their theoretical functions in cost efficient and risk hedging, the research question whether derivatives usage has impact on risk profile of unit trusts as well as their performances is also examined. By applying one Logit regression model, the size and age are found significantly related to the decision to use derivatives. Also it is found that one third of the popular unit trusts use derivatives, which is higher than the results from prior papers that use normal sample. Through traditional risk-adjusted performance measure, Jensen's alpha and Sharpe Ratio, the whole sample show superior performance significantly. However, there is no evidence to exhibit that it is the use of derivatives that improve the performance of these popular unit trusts...|$|E
40|$|Animal {{research}} and computational modeling have indicated {{an important role}} for the neuromodulatory locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system in the control of behavior. According to the adaptive gain theory, the LC-NE system is critical for optimizing behavioral performance by regulating the balance between exploitative and exploratory control states. However, crucial direct empirical tests of this theory in human subjects have been lacking. We used a pharmacological manipulation of the LC-NE system to test predictions of this theory in humans. In a double-blind parallel-groups design (N = 52), participants received 4 mg reboxetine (a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor), 30 mg citalopram (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) or placebo. The adaptive gain theory predicted that the increased tonic NE levels induced by reboxetine would promote task disengagement and exploratory behavior. We assessed the effects of reboxetine on performance in two cognitive tasks designed to examine task (dis) engagement and exploitative versus exploratory behavior: a diminishing-utility task and a gambling task with a non-stationary <b>pay-off</b> <b>structure.</b> In contrast to predictions of the adaptive gain theory, {{we did not find}} differences in task (dis) engagement or exploratory behavior between the three experimental groups, despite demonstrable effects of the two drugs on non-specific central and autonomic nervous system parameters. Our findings suggest that the LC-NE system may not be involved in the regulation of the exploration-exploitation trade-off in humans, at least not {{within the context of a}} single task. It remains to be examined whether the LC-NE system is involved in random exploration exceeding the current task context...|$|E
40|$|This article {{reviews and}} evaluates the {{effectiveness}} of interventions aiming to encourage households to reduce energy consumption. Thirty-eight studies performed {{within the field of}} (applied) social and environmental psychology are reviewed, and categorized as involving either antecedent strategies (i. e. commitment, goal setting, information, modeling) or consequence strategies (i. e. feedback, rewards). Particular attention is given to the following evaluation criteria: (1) to what extent did the intervention result in behavioral changes and/or reductions in energy use, (2) were underlying behavioral determinants examined (e. g. knowledge, attitudes), (3) to what extent could effects be attributed to the interventions and, (4) were effects maintained over longer periods of time? Interestingly, most studies focus on voluntary behavior change, by changing individual knowledge and/or perceptions rather than changing contextual factors (i. e. <b>pay-off</b> <b>structure)</b> which may determine households ’ behavioral decisions. Interventions have been employed with varying degrees of success. Information tends to result in higher knowledge levels, but not necessarily in behavioral changes or energy savings. Rewards have effectively encouraged energy conservation, but with rather short-lived effects. Feedback has also proven its merits, in particular when given frequently. Some important issues cloud these conclusions, such as methodological problems. Also, little attention is given to actual environmental impact of energy savings. Often, an intervention’s effectiveness is studied without examining underlying psychological determinants of energy use and energy savings. Also, it is not always clear whether effects were maintained {{over a longer period of}} time. Recommendations are given to further improve intervention planning and to enhance {{the effectiveness of}} interventions...|$|E
40|$|Ports form an {{essential}} part of a country's infrastructure by facilitating trade and ultimately helping to reduce the cost of goods for consumers. They are characterised by solidity in physical infrastructure and legislative frameworks – or high levels of “asset specificity” – but also face the dynamics of constantly changing global market conditions requiring flexible responsiveness. Through a New Institutional Economics lens, the ports of Port Hedland (Australia), Prince Rupert (Canada), and Tauranga (New Zealand) are analysed. This dissertation undertakes a cross-country comparative analysis, but also extends the empirical framework into an historical analysis using archival data for each case study from 1860 – 2012. How each port's unique institutional environment – the constraints, or “rules of the game” – affected their development and organisational structure is then investigated. This enables the research to avoid the problem where long periods of economic and political stability in core institutions can become the key explanatory variables. The study demonstrates how the institutional <b>pay-off</b> <b>structure</b> determines what organisational forms come into existence at each port and where, why and how they direct their resources. Sometimes, even immense political will and capital investment will see a port flounder (Prince Rupert); or great resource booms will never be captured (Port Hedland); other times, the port may be the victim of special interest pressure from afar (Tauranga). All of these failures, and eventual successes, are traced to changes in each port's institutional environment over time. This work is particularly relevant to those involved in port planning of all forms, whether dealing with higher-level governance issues or everyday allocation problems. The thesis concludes that for ports, institutions do matter: without understanding the institutional constraints a particular port faces at a particular point in time, even the best laid plans may go awry...|$|E
