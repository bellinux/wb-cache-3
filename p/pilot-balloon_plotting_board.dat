50|$|Although several {{different}} types of <b>plotting</b> <b>boards</b> were used by the Coast Artillery over the years, the example described here is the Whistler-Hearn <b>Plotting</b> <b>Board,</b> Model of 1904 which was widely employed by the Coast Artillery between about 1905 and 1925. This description is primarily derived from two manuals of the period, each of which leaves {{certain aspects of the}} board's design and use unexplained. A 1940 manual also describes the Whistler-Hearn board.|$|R

Another helpful diagram is shown on the base end station page—the cutaway diagram of a battery's plotting room (with its <b>plotting</b> <b>board),</b> shown next to the two base end stations, and behind the directing point of the battery, between its two guns.|$|R
50|$|A <b>plotting</b> <b>board</b> was a {{mechanical}} device {{used by the}} U.S. Coast Artillery to track the observed course of a target (typically a moving ship), project its future position, and derive the uncorrected data on azimuth (or direction) and range needed to direct the fire of the guns of a battery to hit that target. <b>Plotting</b> <b>boards</b> of this sort were first employed by the Coast Artillery around 1905, and were the primary means of calculating firing data until WW2.|$|R

50|$|Between the American Civil War and 1905, {{numerous}} small improvements, such as telescopic {{sights and}} optical rangefinders, {{were made in}} fire control. There were also procedural improvements, like the use of <b>plotting</b> <b>boards</b> to manually predict {{the position of a}} ship during an engagement.|$|R
50|$|The {{uncorrected}} firing data, {{to which}} such corrections were applied, were those derived, for instance, from using a <b>plotting</b> <b>board</b> {{to track the}} position of an observed target (e.g., a ship) and the range and azimuth to that target from the guns of a battery.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A {{series of}} {{observed}} positions (blue circles) established the likely {{track of the}} target. Using the <b>plotting</b> <b>board,</b> the set forward point was determined, based upon the target's observed course and speed and an assumption about when the gun was to be fired.|$|R
5000|$|Using the <b>plotting</b> <b>board</b> {{required}} {{a team of}} five or six soldiers to handle the board itself, five or six more to handle equipment used to correct and adjust the resulting target coordinates and a minimum of four more in the two distant base end stations. Many of the <b>plotting</b> <b>board</b> functions described below were performed repeatedly, during several successive observation/firing intervals (see Figure 1 below, left) that were indicated throughout the harbor defense system by the ringing of time interval bells [...]The process began when a target (e.g., an enemy ship) was identified by the harbor command and assigned to a given gun battery. Observers in the two widely separated base end stations for the chosen battery tracked the target, using either azimuth scopes or more sophisticated depression position finders (DPFs).|$|R

50|$|A {{plotting}} {{room was}} connected by telephone lines (and sometimes by radio) to base end stations (at left, top) that observed {{the locations of}} enemy ships and sent data to plotting room soldiers who used equipment like a <b>plotting</b> <b>board</b> to calculate where the guns should be pointed and {{when they should be}} fired.|$|R

50|$|The images here show another {{feature of}} the mortar pits—the data booth.

50|$|Early systems {{made use}} of {{multiple}} observation or base end stations (see Figure 1) to find and track targets attacking American harbors. Data from these stations were then passed to plotting rooms, where analog mechanical devices, such as the <b>plotting</b> <b>board,</b> were used to estimate targets' positions and derive firing data for batteries of coastal guns assigned to interdict them.|$|R
50|$|The <b>{{plotting}}</b> <b>board</b> {{for a given}} gun battery {{was located}} in the plotting room for that battery (shown at right, bottom), a space often attached to an observation post or protected within a reinforced concrete bunker or casemate. It was served by a large crew (often {{more than a dozen}} soldiers) who were part of the Range Section of the battery personnel.|$|R
5000|$|To {{locate a}} target, <b>plotting</b> <b>board</b> {{operators}} used two radial arms (called {{the primary and}} auxiliary arms), and [...] "locked-in" [...] the ends of these arms along on the notched azimuth scale that ran around the circumference of the board at the azimuths of the sightings that were telephoned in {{to them by the}} two base end stations. These locked arms and the baseline arm (along the base of the arc) then formed a triangle whose vertices were the two observation stations and the target. This located the target on the board, and its position was then marked by punching a hole in the paper placed over the <b>plotting</b> <b>board.</b> Next, another radial arm, called the gun arm, was swung over the plotted position of the target, and the resulting range and azimuth for firing were read off the gun arm and an azimuth scale on the gun arm center. These data were corrected or adjusted for some other variables, and telephoned to the gun/s.|$|R

Finally, fire was adjusted for observations of the actual fall of the shells (3), and new firing data were sent to the guns.|$|R

50|$|The Whistler-Hearn <b>plotting</b> <b>board</b> (see Plate XXV at right, top) was a semicircular {{wooden table}} about 7.5 feet in {{diameter}} with a mechanism on top that could be configured to represent the geography of the harbor area {{in which it was}} used, including the locations of the base end stations that observed targets for the gun battery it controlled and the location of the gun/s of that battery.|$|R

50|$|Proper {{alignment}} and {{rotation of}} the inter-related scales and arms enabled corrections to be read off the three different scales that ran horizontally {{across the bottom of}} the board (the travel scale, the deflection scale, and the azimuth correction scale). Even then, however, the use of the device was complicated, since it yielded reference numbers that had to be fed back to the operators of the <b>plotting</b> <b>board</b> before being fed to the guns.|$|R
