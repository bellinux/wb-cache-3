The windborne debris usually imposes high speed localized {{impact on the}} building envelope, which may harm people inside the building and create dominant openings. A dominant opening in the building envelope might cause internal pressure increasing and result in substantial damage to the building structures, such as roof lifting up or even collapse. To withstand the impact of such extreme event, the <b>penetration</b> <b>resistant</b> capacity of wall or roof panels to windborne debris impact should meet the requirements specified in the wind loading codes, e. g., the Australian Wind Loading Code (AS/NZS 1170. 2 : 2011). In this study, a composite Structural Insulated Panel (SIP) with Extended Polystyrene (EPS) core sandwiched by flat metal skins that is commonly used in building industry was investigated. To study the structural response and <b>penetration</b> <b>resistant</b> capacity of the composite panel against windborne debris impacts, a series of laboratory tests were carried out by using a pneumatic cannon testing system. The effects of various specimen configurations, impact locations and debris impact velocities on their performance were investigated. The failure modes under various projectile impact scenarios were observed and compared by using two high-speed cameras. The dynamic responses were examined quantitatively {{in terms of the}} opening size, residual velocity of projectile, deformation and strain time histories on the back skin measured in the tests. The penetration resistance capacity of the panels subjected to windborne debris impact were examined and analyzed. In addition, numerical models were developed in LS-DYNA to simulate the response and damage of the composite SIP under windborne debris impact. Laboratory tested panels were first modeled. The test data was used to calibrate the accuracy of the numerical model. The validated numerical model was then used to conduct more numerical simulations to obtain more results such as energy absorption, impact force and vulnerability curve of the SIP against windborne debris impact...|$|E
40|$|For a {{long time}} it has been {{believed}} that lignification has {{an important role in}} host defense against pathogen invasion. Recently, by using an RNAi gene-silencing assay we showed that monolignol biosynthesis plays a critical role in cell wall apposition (CWA) -mediated defense against powdery mildew fungus penetration into diploid wheat. Silencing monolignol genes led to super-susceptibility of wheat leaf tissues to an appropriate pathogen, Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt), and compromised penetration resistance to a non-appropriate pathogen, B. graminis f. sp. hordei. Autofluorescence of CWA regions was reduced significantly at the fungal penetration sites in silenced cells. Our work indicates an important role for monolignol biosynthetic genes in effective CWA formation against pathogen penetration. In this addendum, we show that silencing of monolignol genes also compromised <b>penetration</b> <b>resistant</b> to Bgt in a resistant wheat line.

40|$|Four {{strains of}} Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{obtained}} from clinical isolates which are carbenicillin resistant were studied {{to find the}} cause(s) of resistance to this beta-lactam antibiotic. The electrophoresis patterns of the four strains (PH 20610, PH 20815, PH 4011, and PH 4301) {{were found to be}} different from those of a wild-type strain, P. aeruginosa NCTC 10662, and appeared to lack penicillin-binding protein 2. Affinity of other penicillin-binding proteins from strains PH 20610 and PH 20815 for carbenicillin seemed to be normal or slightly diminished. Electrophoretic patterns of penicillin-binding proteins from strains PH 4011 and PH 4301 had more profound differences, since the affinities of their penicillin-binding proteins 1 a, 1 b, and 4 for carbenicillin were decreased by nearly two orders of magnitude relative to the preparations from the wild-type strain. Kinetic studies on binding of carbenicillin to penicillin-binding proteins both in isolated membrane preparations and in intact cells revealed that carbenicillin <b>penetration</b> into <b>resistant</b> cells was a much slower process than in susceptible cells, suggesting that the outer envelope structures serve as an efficient barrier against carbenicillin entry into our P. aeruginosa strains from clinical isolates...|$|R
40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) invades {{the central nervous}} system (CNS) shortly after systemic infection and can result in the subsequent development of HIV- 1 –associated dementia (HAD) in a subset of infected individuals. Genetically compartmentalized virus in the CNS is associated with HAD, suggesting autonomous viral replication as a factor in the disease process. We examined the source of compartmentalized HIV- 1 in the CNS of subjects with HIV- 1 –associated neurological disease and in asymptomatic subjects who were initiating antiretroviral therapy. The heteroduplex tracking assay (HTA), targeting the variable regions of env, was used to determine which HIV- 1 genetic variants in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were compartmentalized and which variants were shared with the blood plasma. We then measured the viral decay kinetics of individual variants after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. Compartmentalized HIV- 1 variants in the CSF of asymptomatic subjects decayed rapidly after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy, with a mean half-life of 1. 57 days. Rapid viral decay was also measured for CSF-compartmentalized variants in four HAD subjects (t 1 / 2 mean = 2. 27 days). However, slow viral decay was measured for CSF-compartmentalized variants from an additional four subjects with neurological disease (t 1 / 2 range = 9. 85 days to no initial decay). The slow decay detected for CSF-compartmentalized variants was not associated with poor CNS drug <b>penetration,</b> drug <b>resistant</b> virus in the CSF, or the presence of X 4 virus genotypes...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of transfection by Rous sarcoma virus DNA was investigated by assaying DNA-mediated transformation under conditions which restricted secondary virus infection. Chicken embryo fibroblasts which were genetically resistant to virus infection {{as a result}} of the absence of receptors for virus <b>penetration</b> were also <b>resistant</b> to transformation by integrated or unintegrated Rous sarcoma virus DNA. In addition, DNA of replication-defective Bryan hightiter Rous sarcoma virus was noninfectious, and transformation by DNA of a temperature-sensitive DNA polymerase mutant was temperature sensitive. These results indicated that secondary virus infection was necessary for transformation by Rous sarcoma virus DNA. Since transformation was assayed by colony formation in soft agar, as well as by focus formation, the requirement for secondary virus infection was not an artifact of potential difficulty in detection of foci formed by division of single transformed cells. Therefore, it appeared that donor DNA did not stably transform recipient cells by direct integration. Instead, the results were consistent with the hypothesis that transfection of chicken embryo fibroblasts by Rous sarcoma virus DNA proceeded by transcription of donor DNA, formation of extracellular progeny virus, and secondary virus infection of sensitive cells...|$|R

40|$|Performance {{evaluation}} of electric motors {{is a major}} function of the Power Electronics and Electric Machinery Research Center (PEEMRC). Normally these motors have a fixed wire-wound stator and a rotating rotor, which may have conductors embedded in a ferromagnetic core (induction motors), magnets mounted {{on the surface of}} the ferromagnetic core with a thin metal or composite cylinder or ring to hold them in place, or magnets embedded in the ferromagnetic core. Most of the work currently involves the last two permanent magnet (PM) configurations. Although the stator of a radial-gap motor can absorb energy from many of the fragments ejected from the rotor during operation, the stator of an axial-gap motor is not positioned to provide significant protection. The housing of each motor can also absorb some of the energy. The most conservative approach, however, is to assume that all fragments from the rotor must be contained by a protective enclosure. An ideal enclosure is transparent. Manufacturers of such plastics as Lexan, Tuffak, and Cyrolon sell different variations of transparent enclosure material. Lexan is a polycarbonate sheet. Lexgard{reg_sign} is a <b>penetration</b> <b>resistant</b> material made by layering polycarbonate material between pieces of ordinary glass. A fragment striking a sheet of enclosure material will pierce the surface layer, but the layered polycarbonate-glass material is able to absorb the fragment's energy before it completes penetration. Tuffak{reg_sign} is Lexan polycarbonate. Cyrolon{reg_sign} bullet resistant material is acrylic sheet. The ability of the enclosure to stop a fragment depends on its thickness as well as the penetration capability of the fragment; for example, a lead fragment has much less penetrating capability than a steel fragment. Enclosure thicknesses are commercially available to provide several levels of protection. These levels depend on the momentum of the fragments and have been evaluated for some common types of ammunition. This summary quantifies four typical worst-case fragments which have maximum translational kinetic energy when ejected from a rotating annulus. (1) The first fragment is released from a rotating annular titanium ring. (2) The second fragment is a magnet released from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory's (ORNL's) 30 -kW axial-gap PM motor. Analysis of the second fragment which is like a segment of half-angle, {alpha}, from a thin annular ring is similar to that of the titanium ring segment except that the angle is 10 {sup o} instead of 133 {sup o}. (3) The third fragment is a magnet from the radial-gap 6 -kW fractional-slot surface-mounted PM (SPM) motor with concentrated windings. Analysis of the third fragment is similar to the analysis of the second fragment. (4) The fourth fragment is a 133 {sup o} segment of an entire rotor which assumes that the laminates and magnets in the rotor fail as a single fragment, truly a worst case assumption...|$|E
40|$|In two {{organically}} cultivated field trials, {{located in}} Germany and Greece, effects of reduced primary tillage systems on root and shoot growth of cereals were investigated. The field trial in Rommersheim near Mainz, Germany, {{was established in}} 1994. A similar experiment was established in 1995 located in Athens, Greece. Mouldboard plough, two-layer plough and layer cultivator were used in Germany. Mouldboard plough, rotary hoe and zero tillage were applied in Greece. The field experiment in Germany was performed on a clay loam soil with a 5 -year crop rotation (green fallow, winter wheat/catch crop, peas, winter rye/catch crop, spring barley) in a split-plot design. The investigated crop was spring barley and winter rye. Tillage systems were implemented after cereal harvests only. The field experiment in Greece was performed on a clay loam soil with a 3 -year crop rotation (cereal, green manure, cotton) and a split-plot design. The test crop was winter wheat. The parameters measured in both field trials were soil physical and chemical parameters, as well as root and shoot parameters of the cereals. In Germany higher tillage intensity implemented on spring barley on one hand reduced aggregate stability and decreased the <b>penetration</b> <b>resistant,</b> especially in lower depths. On the other hand, it increased rooting density, nutrient uptake and crop development. Dry matter production of weeds was significantly lower in the ploughed fields compared with those treated with the cultivator. Correspondingly, higher grain yields were positively correlated with tillage intensity. Positive effects of the cultivator on soil properties (e. g. significant higher aggregate stability compared to ploughing) became less significant. The two-layer plough used in Germany combines the effects of turning and mixing the soil in the upper plough depth, while loosening the soil in the deeper plough layer, resulting in a good soil structure. The differences between the tillage systems in the parameters measured became less when they were releated to the winter rye. This fact {{was due to the}} lack of tillage before the seeding of the crop. In the experiment field of Athens, under minimum and zero tillage, it was found that root and shoot parameters were significantly higher than those of ploughed plots. Physical and chemical soil properties were also improved compared to those of ploughed soil. Yields were found to be significantly correlated to the root parameters and the soil properties, and this was confirmed by the significant yield increase observed under minimum tillage. Concluding the results show that under conditions of temperate humid climate sufficient control of weed and optimized nutrient management in organic farming can only be ensured by turning and mixing the soil. Thus, a general renunciation of ploughing cannot be suggested. Under conditions of primary tillage becomes more important for the main soil properties and more Mediterranean climate and limited soil water availability, reduced profitable in the long term...|$|E
40|$|In Egypt, Biomphalaria alexandrina is the {{intermediate}} host for Schistosoma mansoni. The fates of Schistosoma miracidia in the snails varies between {{different species of}} Biomphalaria. The internal defense system {{is one of the}} factors that influence the susceptibility pattern of the snails. The interaction between Biomphalaria snails and S. mansoni needs to be identified for each species, and even between the members of the same species with different degrees of susceptibility. In the present study, the first generation of susceptible and resistant parents of B. alexandrina was examined histologically at the 30 th day post exposure. The study includes the characterization of the immune response, as expressed by tissue reactions, of susceptible and resistant B. alexandrina snails against S. mansoni. It was also designed to determine the impact of the resistance increase in parent snails, on the mechanisms of interaction of their offspring against infection. The results showed that the infection rate of the offspring from the susceptible parents was 92 %. No susceptible offspring was produced from the resistant parents. When the parents were of equal number of susceptible and resistant snails, they gave an offspring with an infection rate of 20 %. Susceptible snails that had susceptible parents showed a higher degree of susceptibility than those that had both susceptible and resistant parents. A common feature of the resistant snails was the absence of any viable parasites. The tissue reactions of the resistant snails having only resistant parents occurred at the site of miracidial <b>penetration.</b> In <b>resistant</b> snails for which susceptible ones were included in their parents, the reactions occurred in the deep tissues. These results characterized the immune response of B. alexandrina snails against Schistosoma infection which was found to occur by two different mechanisms. One type of defense occurs in highly resistant snails, and employs direct miracidial destruction soon after parasite penetration. The other type occurs in less resistant snails where a delayed resistance development occurs after the dissemination of the sporocysts in the snail tissues. It seems that B. alexandrina snails respond more or less similar to B. glabrata. The results also proved that the immune response of the internal defense system increased with increasing the number of the inherited resistant genes...|$|R

The sequence of events that took place from post inoculation up to penetration was surveyed by scanning electron microscopy. Germination of allantoid secondary sporidia occurred normally on various spike parts in all three inoculation methods. Directional growth toward the stomata or the bulliform cells of glumes, lemma and rachis was not seen. Direct penetration through the epidermal cells of rachis, lemma and glumes, but not through ovarian walls was sporadically seen only in the susceptible cultivar. Hyphal anastomoses on the glumes and rachis surface of all cultivars were occasionally observed. Penetration of sporidial germ tubes and hyphae through stomata was observed. Entrance of germ tube and hyphae to the bulliform cells was also seen. In most cases, hyphae that tended to penetrate the stomata, actually extruded out instead and frequently true penetration was not observed. This indicates that infection development may take place only when two compatible hyphae are anastomosed {{in the early stages}} of <b>penetration.</b> In physiologically <b>resistant</b> lines examined in this study, disease did not develop, even after penetration of the spike by the fungus. This indicates that resistance mechanism to N. indica in wheat might become operative only after penetration...|$|R
40|$|Root knot (Meloidogyne spp.) and cyst (Heterodera and Globodera spp.) {{nematodes}} infect {{all important}} crop species, {{and the annual}} economic loss due to these pathogens exceeds $ 90 billion. We screened the worldwide accession collection with the root-knot nematodes Meloidogyne incognita, M. arenaria and M. hapla, soybean cyst nematode (SCN-Heterodera glycines), sugar beet cyst nematode (SBCN-Heterodera schachtii) and clover cyst nematode (CLCN-Heterodera trifolii), revealing resistant and susceptible accessions. In the over 100 accessions evaluated, we observed a range of responses to the root-knot nematode species, and a non-host response was observed for SCN and SBCN infection. However, variation was observed with respect to infection by CLCN. While many cultivars including Jemalong A 17 were resistant to H. trifolii, cultivar Paraggio was highly susceptible. Identification of M. truncatula as a host for root-knot nematodes and H. trifolii and the differential host response to both RKN and CLCN provide the opportunity to genetically and molecularly characterize genes involved in plant-nematode interaction. Accession DZA 045, obtained from an Algerian population, was resistant to all three root-knot nematode species and was used for further studies. The mechanism of resistance in DZA 045 appears different from Mi-mediated root-knot nematode resistance in tomato. Temporal analysis of nematode infection showed {{that there is no}} difference in nematode <b>penetration</b> between the <b>resistant</b> and susceptible accessions, and no hypersensitive response was observed in the resistant accession even several days after infection. However, less than 5 % of the nematode population completed the life cycle as females in the resistant accession. The remainder emigrated from the roots, developed as males, or died inside the roots as undeveloped larvae. Genetic analyses carried out by crossing DZA 045 with a susceptible French accession, F 83005, suggest that one gene controls resistance in DZA 045...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{degradation}} in {{crop production}} {{is becoming increasingly}} important because of the growing concern it poses on soil functions. Prominent among the degradation factors is soil compaction. It impairs soil productivity by impeding the soil conductivity potential and moisture retention ability, thereby preventing root penetrability and nutrients uptake among other things. This paper is concerned with identifying and characterizing the degree of compaction that may result in deleterious effects on soil physical properties, and the interaction that exists between crop growth and productivity. The above shall be achieved through field and laboratory determination of soil measurements from samples collected on a silty clay loam, and a silty loam soil at the University of Life Sciences (UMB / NMBU) experiment field Three land preparation practices (Autumn ploughing at 20 – 22 cm depth; Spring ploughing at 12 – 15 cm depth and Spring harrowing at 4 - 6 cm depth i. e. without ploughing), stubble cultivation and compaction were the treatments used in a three factorial field trials on a silty clay loam and a silty loam soil to conduct the investigation at the UMB / NMBU experiment field. The three main grain crops produced for the last 20 years were: wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), oats (Avena sativa L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Field data collection and standard laboratory procedures were performed using different equipments and gadgets to process the data. These were calculated and statistically analyzed by the ANOVA methods (GLM procedure), (SAS Institute, 1990). The various treatments did not show much diversity in densification save few tillage applications with stubble cultivation, compaction, and a combined tillage and compaction treatments that were significant S* (i. e. Pr > F) than the others as shown in Tables 2, 4, 8 and 9 in results. Tillage in depths 5 - 10 cm and 15 – 20 cm showed significant <b>penetration</b> <b>resistant</b> (PR) (Pr > F), and stubble cultivation in depths 10 – 15 cm and 25 – 30 cm also gave significant PR (Pr > F). Fraction 6 – 20 mm exhibited significant aggregate size distribution with tillage application (Pr > F) in Tab. 4. Volume % was significant (Pr > F) with compaction application for pF 4. 2 in depth 25 - 30 cm, while weight % was equally significant for pF 4. 2 in the same depth with the same treatment. The same trend occurred for both pF 4. 2 weight % and volume % for combined tillage times compaction application in the same depths. There was minimal difference in dry matter (DM) % between treatments, as well as water content in grain yield at harvest. However, both grain yield and dry matter % showed significant level (Pr > F) with tillage treatment, but only grain yield gave significant level with compaction treatment. The maximum bulk density (BD) observed in this trial was 1. 60 g / cm³, which is just slightly above the minimum critical limit of 1. 55 g / cm³ that may restrict root penetration. In this case, any hindrance to root piercing may eminate from the presence of clay minerals, ions bonding and particle density. This implies that a minimum level of compaction resulted from the treatments. M-P...|$|E
40|$|Edge wicking, i. e. {{in-plane}} wetting, is {{an important}} parameter for liquid packaging board products. Before filling of the products at the dairy the web is being sterilised with hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2). A tube is shaped and cut into packages which mean that new surfaces are created. If a short stop occurs in the sterilising bath the raw edges exposed to H 2 O 2 could absorb the liquid and when the package later is being filled this absorption could lead to tube burst. For the end products {{it is also important}} to prevent the liquid from penetrating the raw edges of the board in order to maintain the functionality and fresh look of the package. To control edge wicking different kinds of internal hydrophobic sizing agents are used. Alkyl ketene dimer (AKD) is the most common size in neutral sizing and rosin in conjunction with alum is the traditional acidic sizing agent. AKD and rosin size are often used in combination (dual sizing) to make the board hydrophobic. The objective of this work was to examine the effects of the sizing agents on different pulps in different dosages. The pulps used in the sheet preparation were unbleached kraft pulp as well as bleached and unbleached CTMP refined to different levels. Apart from varying the size dosages, the wet sheets were also pressed at different levels to vary the density. The major part of the study included dual sizing but a minor part also concerned mono sized sheets. The parameters investigated on the laboratory sheets were STFI-Density, hydrogen peroxide edge wicking, pressurised edge wicking, lactic acid edge wicking (LA) and AKD and rosin size content. In hydrogen peroxide edge wicking the amount of size was the central source of improved wick index. The retention was therefore of great significance for the results. The dual sized sheets were found to give least edge wicking, due to the synergy effect between AKD and alum rosin size. The kraft pulps gave sheets with satisfactory edge wicking even at the lowest size dosage (1 kg/t) while CTMP required a dosage of 4 kg/t to reach the same wick index. To achieve acceptable pressurised edge wicking values the most important parameter was found to be the density of the sheets. The kraft pulp sheets gave the lowest edge penetration while the high freeness CTMP sheets did not give satisfactory <b>penetration</b> <b>resistant</b> even at the highest size dosage. The edge wicking of lactic acid could be prevented by sizing with AKD only. Sheets made from mono sized sheets containing rosin size did not manage to avoid a large in-plane wetting of the board structure. Hence, dual sizing to improve the edge wicking of lactic acid is not necessary. The density was found not to be an important parameter in lactic acid edge wicking, all the pulps got equal edge wicking regardless of density. Retention above 1 kg/t AKD in sheets was enough to prevent penetration. Retention above 1. 5 kg/t AKD in sheet did not improve the edge wicking any further. No significant difference in sizeability between unbleached and bleached CTMP was observed...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1965 The incitant of Verticillium wilt of {{peppermint}} (Verticillium dahliae Kleb.) causes disease symptoms {{only in the}} genera Mentha (the mints) and Monarda. This fungus {{is unable}} to grow saprophytically through natural soil. V. dahliae survives in soil by colonizing and forming microsclerotia in susceptible plants, living root tissue of many resistant plants, and, to a limited extent, non-living plant residues. Fluctuations in populations of V. dahliae in the rhizosphere and penetration of the roots of host and non-host plants were studied in the greenhouse. Rhizosphere soil was collected from plants and diluted into ethanol-streptomycin agar (ESA) by standard soil dilution techniques. Rhizosphere soils from all plants tested had significantly higher populations of V. dahliae than did non-rhizosphere soils. V. dahliae populations in non-rhizosphere soil always remained relatively stable over an eight week period. Resistant and susceptible mint species supported in the rhizosphere, indicating that similar populations of V. dahliae susceptible mint species do not selectively stimulate the pathogen near the root surface. Tomato, a symptomless host of the mint strain of V. dahliae, also supported large populations of V. dahliae in the rhizosphere, but plants such as wheat, corn, and beans (non-hosts) tended to support fewer numbers of Verticillium propagules in the rhizosphere than host plants. Roots from the rhizosphere test plants were thoroughly washed, coarsely chopped, placed in petri dishes, and covered with ESA to determine relative numbers of root penetrations. There were {{no statistically significant differences}} in numbers of root <b>penetrations</b> between <b>resistant</b> and susceptible mint species, but if roots were finely fragmented to release the contents of the vascular system, many more V. dahliae propagules were recovered from susceptible mint roots than from resistant mint roots. of susceptible mints were invaded to a much those of resistant mints. Symptomless host fewer penetration sites on roots than either mint species. The vascular systems greater extent than and non-host plants had resistant or susceptible Three mint species of low, medium, and high resistance were grown in field soil infested with 10, 100, and 1000 V. dahliae microsclerotia per gram of soil. Susceptible Mentha piperita L. exhibited severe disease symptoms at all inoculum density levels. Symptoms on moderately resistant Hybrid 88 - 148 increased from mild to moderate to severe with each increase in inoculum density. Resistant M. crispa L. showed only mild to moderate symptoms at all inoculum density levels. However, yields were drastically reduced in all species at the lowest inoculum density compared to non-infested controls. Higher levels of inoculum density reduced yields still more, {{but not as much as}} the low inoculum density, which was the most critical level of infestation for yield reduction. Soil assays after two years' cropping showed that V. dahliae populations increased over the original level of infestation only at the low inoculum density, regardless of the mint species grown. The amount of increase in V. dahliae populations was correlated with susceptibility. Soil assays after a six month fallow period showed that increases in V, dahliae populations at the low inoculum density were temporary; all plots had populations lower than the original level of infestation. Susceptible indicator plants were grown in all plots after the fallow period to measure inoculum potential. Disease symptoms and reductions in yields were unusually severe in low inoculum density plots on which susceptible M. piperita was originally grown. The susceptible mint apparently maintained a higher inoculum potential at the low inoculum density than did resistant species...|$|R
