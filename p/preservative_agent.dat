40|$|A multicentric study {{concerning}} {{the frequency of}} positive allergic patch test reactions to mercury and to thiomersal has been conducted in France and in Belgium among 2, 000 adult patients submitted to routine patch testing. 73 (3. 6 p. 100) patients had a positive patch test to mercury and 47 (2. 3 p. 100) to thiomersal, 22 (1. 1 p. 100) reacted positively to both mercurials. These high figures are most probably in relation with a broad use of mercurials in both countries, as antiseptics as well as <b>preservative</b> <b>agents</b> in topical drugs. They lead to a careful use of mercurials, which have to be avoided when they can be advantageously replaced by other antiseptics or <b>preservative</b> <b>agents.</b> As far as cosmetics are concerned, the use of mercurials (chemical nature and concentration) is restricted by a Recommendation of the European Council...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. CD 59 {{is one of}} the {{complement}} regulatory proteins (CRPs) which exert inhibitory function {{by blocking}} the formation of C 5 b- 9 complex or Membrane Attacks complex (MAC). Regarding the therapeutic role of CD 59 in treatment of pathological effects in uncontrolled activation of complements system and its efficiency to overcome the hyper-acute rejection, CD 59 was suggested for maintenance of transplanted organ. In this study We determined and isolated CD 59 from seminal plasma. &# 13; Methods. Six normospermic sample according to WHO standards were chosen. Plasma of samples was separated and to remove the postasomes, the seminal plama was ultra centrifuged. CD 59 was detected by Dot-Blot using CD 59 mAb (MEM 43). The molecular weight and purity of protein was detected by SOS-PAGE method follwed by Westerm Blot. &# 13; Results. Protein was present in the 6. 5 ml and 15 ml of gel fitration fractions. Molecular weight based on marker size in these two fractions was 65 and 21 KD respectively. Discussion. CD 59 had previously beem purified by lysis of erythrocyte cell membrane.

5000|$|Hops are {{the female}} flower {{clusters}} or seed cones of the hop vine Humulus lupulus, {{which are used}} as a flavouring and <b>preservative</b> <b>agent</b> in nearly all beer made today. [...] Hops had been used for medicinal and food flavouring purposes since Roman times; by the 7th century in Carolingian monasteries {{in what is now}} Germany, beer was being made with hops, though it isn't until the thirteenth century that widespread cultivation of hops for use in beer is recorded. Before the thirteenth century, beer was flavoured with plants such as yarrow, wild rosemary, and bog myrtle, and other ingredients such as juniper berries, aniseed and ginger, which would be combined into a mixture known as gruit and used as hops are now used; between the thirteenth and the sixteenth century, during which hops took over as the dominant flavouring, beer flavoured with gruit was known as ale, while beer flavoured with hops was known as beer. Some beers today, such as Fraoch by the Scottish Heather Ales company and Cervoise Lancelot by the French Brasserie-Lancelot company, use plants other than hops for flavouring.|$|E
5000|$|Worthing {{developed}} in the pre-medieval era as a small southern outpost of the parish and larger village of Broadwater, based on farming and fishing. Teville Stream and its estuary, upon which a harbour was situated by the 14th century, separated the hamlet from Broadwater. The early farmers reclaimed land from the sea, but it was lost again to flooding during the Middle Ages. Soon after this, a bar of shingle began to form in the sea, affecting the current and also the tidal flow of the stream. This protected the coastline and allowed salt marshes to form. [...] Usually called the [...] "saltgreen", [...] "Worthing Common" [...] or, most often, the [...] "saltgrass", this fertile soil contained large amounts of saltâ€”the most important <b>preservative</b> <b>agent</b> of the pre-refrigeration era. Salt and other minerals were extracted, and the land was used for farming. [...] Instead of being enclosed, as much land was at the time, it was left as common land; Worthing's inhabitants were granted leases to graze their animals on it. [...] Some buildings also stood there: an early courthouse, and some buildings called [...] "shops" [...] which {{were likely to be}} fishing-related.

40|$|Collection {{of human}} whole blood for genomic DNA {{extraction}} is part of numerous clinical studies. Since DNA extraction cannot always be performed {{at the time of}} sample collection, whole blood samples may be stored for years before being processed. The use of appropriate storage conditions is then critical to obtain DNA in sufficient quantity and of adequate quality in order to obtain reliable results from the subsequent molecular biological analyses. In this study, EDTA whole blood samples were collected from 8 healthy volunteers, and different durations (up to 1 year) and temperatures (room temperature, 4 Â°C, - 20 Â°C, and - 80 Â°C) of storage were compared. The effect of the addition of a DNA <b>preservative</b> <b>agent</b> was also assessed before and after storage. DNA concentrations measured by UV spectrophotometry and spectrofluorometry were used to calculate DNA extraction yields and double-strand DNA ratios. DNA integrity was controlled by agarose gel electrophoresis and long-range polymerase chain reaction. The impact of storage conditions on DNA methylation was also evaluated. Results showed that certain storage conditions {{have a significant impact on}} the DNA extraction yield but little or no effect on DNA integrity and methylation. Storage of EDTA blood at - 80 Â°C guarantees high-quality DNA with a good yield. Higher DNA extraction yields were obtained with the addition of a DNA <b>preservative</b> <b>agent</b> before thawing EDTA blood stored at - 20 Â°C or - 80 Â°C.

40|$|Abstract: Ocular Surface Disease (OSD) is {{prevalent}} among medically treated patients with glaucoma. This is basically related to three key-points: OSD and glaucoma are both prevalent in elderly and are common comorbidities {{in the same}} patient; {{the role of the}} active ingredient of the medical antiglaucomatous therapy; the role of the <b>preservative</b> <b>agent</b> of this medical therapy. Considering the actual state of literature we can state that the active glaucoma agent have a role in OSD, but the main cause seems to be the <b>preservative</b> <b>agent,</b> in particular referring to benzalkonium chloride, BAK. In the clinical evaluation of dry eye patients there is no actually established gold standard. Since the ocular surface injury not only causes dry eye, red eye, eye itching, photophobia and other discomforts, but also increases the risk of failure of glaucoma surgery in patients, it becomes fundamental a complete and good clinical evaluation of OSD (considering Schirmerâ€™s test, tear breakup time, corneal and conjunctival staining) together with a good evaluation of patients â€™ quality of life (with validated questionnaires).

By 1 H NMR spectroscopy, para-hydroxymercuribenzoate and para-hydroxymercuriphenylsulphonate were shown to react with aurothiomalate by complexing only with the terminal thiomalate of aurothiomalate oligomers, thereby converting them to ring complexes. The reaction was also detected by UV spectroscopy. The arylmercury complexes produced no change in the bulk of the thiomalate residues of aurothiomalate indicating considerable stability of the polymeric structure of aurothiomalate in which each gold is bound to two thiolate residues. The potent inhibition of the mercurial induced collagenase activity may be due either to aurothiomalate or to a complex formed between the terminal thiomalate residues with the arylmercurial.
