Agreement between observed and computed brightness perturbations is shown to be within 10 percent over the radiometrically opaque, mature regions of the cell. Transparent-channel cell top reflectivities of up to 50 percent in the convective core region and 6 percent in the anvil region are determined, using perturbed and nonscattering weighting functions. A parameterized rain cell model is used in a content analysis of 118 GHz <b>precipitation</b> <b>cell</b> spectra.

40|$|A {{nonlinear}} statistical-retrieval operator for precipitation cell-top altitude using high-spatial-resolution passive 118 -GHz O 2 brightness spectra is demonstrated. The retrieval operator {{consists of}} a Karhunen-Loeve transformation followed by a rank reduction, a linearization, and a linear minimum mean-square-error estimator. Information from the 118 -GHz data on the ambient atmospheric-temperature profile and the <b>precipitation</b> <b>cell</b> size is also incorporated into the linear stage of the retrieval operator. The rms retrieval error is 1. 5 km for cumulus-stage cells with tops ranging from 1. 5 to 16 km. The sensitivity of nadiral 118 -GHz spectra to the cell-top altitude is predominantly due to the scattering and absorption of radiation originating from low, warm atmospheric levels by colder liquid and frozen precipitation This effect causes cold perturbations in the brightness spectrum, which typically become stronger with increasing cell-top altitude...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} a methodology to analyse orographic enhancement of precipitation using sequences of radar images and a digital elevation model. Image processing techniques {{are applied to}} extract <b>precipitation</b> <b>cells</b> from radar imagery. DEM is used to derive the topographic indices potentially relevant to orographic precipitation enhancement at different spatial scales, e. g. terrain convexity and slope exposure to mesoscale flows. Two recently developed machine learning algorithms are then used to analyse {{the relationship between the}} repeatability of precipitation patterns and the underlying topography. Spectral clustering is first used to characterize stratification of the <b>precipitation</b> <b>cells</b> according to different mesoscale flows and exposure to the crest of the Alps. At a second step, support vector machine classifiers are applied to build a computational model which discriminates persistent <b>precipitation</b> <b>cells</b> from all the others (not showing a relationship to topography) in the space of topographic conditioning factors. Upwind slopes and hill tops were found to be the topographic features leading to precipitation repeatability and persistence. Maps of orographic enhancement susceptibility can be computed for a given flow, topography and forecasted smooth precipitation fields and used to improve nowcasting models or correct windward and leeward biases in numerical weather prediction models...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. An algorithm {{has been developed}} for real-time forecasting of <b>precipitation</b> storm <b>cell</b> movement over water. The key to the algorithm is the Kalman filter tracking model which is continually updating the mean value and error covariance matrix of a cell's centroid position from past measurements. The algorithm was developed and applied to <b>precipitation</b> <b>cells</b> to evaluate the advantages of utilizing an optimal recursive processing program to assist in making short term tactical forecasts. This tracking algorithm was designed for use-in a stand alone desktop computer. All of the real-time tracking data was detected by a land-based radar system. The thesis results suggest that for short term forecasting the Kalman filter can produce some improvements over other tracking models, but further refinement in identifying the storm cell center and mathematically identifying the area of extent of each individual cell is needed.

40|$|A {{study of}} the effect of the aging {{atmosphere}} on the activity of co-precipitated copper zinc oxide catalysts for the ambient temperature oxidation of carbon monoxide is described and discussed. Four aging atmospheres are reported: air, N 2, H 2 and CO 2, and both the precipitation and the aging of the precipitate were carried out by flowing these gases through the <b>precipitation</b> <b>cell</b> at constant pH and temperature. For all atmospheres, the surface area of the final CuO-ZnO catalyst increases with aging time and, consequently, the specific activity (mol CO converted/g catalyst/h) also increases. However, the intrinsic activity (mol CO converted/m 2 /h) initially decreases with aging time before attaining a steady level. The highest activity catalysts were obtained using air as the aging atmosphere and TPR studies indicate that this catalyst is less readily reduced. Catalysts prepared using CO 2 as the aging atmosphere have lower activity, although the surface areas of these catalysts are not markedly lower.

40|$|Abstract Objectives It is {{essential}} to understand the molecular basis of ovarian cancer etiology and tumor development to provide more effective preventive and therapeutic approaches to reduce mortality. Particularly, the molecular targets and pathways involved in early malignant transformation are still not clear. Pro-inflammatory lipids and pathways {{have been reported to}} play significant roles in ovarian cancer progression and metastasis. The major objective {{of this study was to}} explore and determine whether platelet activating factor (PAF) and receptor associated networking pathways might significantly induce malignant potential in BRCA 1 -mutant at-risk epithelial cells. Methods BRCA 1 -mutant ovarian epithelial cell lines including (HOSE- 636, HOSE- 642), BRCA 1 -mutant ovarian cancer cell (UWB 1. 289), wild type normal ovarian epithelial cell (HOSE-E 6 E 7) and cancerous cell line (OVCA 429), and the non-malignant BRCA 1 -mutant distal fallopian tube (fimbria) tissue specimens were used in this study. Mutation analysis, kinase microarray, western blot, immune staining, co-immune <b>precipitation,</b> <b>cell</b> cycle, apoptosis, proliferation and bioinformatic pathway analysis were applied. Results We found that PAF, as a potent pro-inflammatory mediator, induced significant anti-apoptotic effect in BRCA 1 - mutant ovarian surface epithelial cells, but not in wild type HOSE cells. With kinase microarray technology and the specific immune approaches, we found that phosphor-STAT 1 was activated by 100 nM PAF treatment only in BRCA 1 -mutant associated at-risk ovarian epithelial cells and ovarian cancer cells, but not in BRCA 1 -wild type normal (HOSE-E 6 E 7) or malignant (OVCA 429) ovarian epithelial cells. Co-immune precipitation revealed that elevated PAFR expression is associated with protein-protein interactions of PAFR-FAK and FAK-STAT 1 in BRCA 1 -mutant ovarian epithelial cells, but not in the wild-type control cells. Conclusion Previous studies showed that potent inflammatory lipid mediators such as PAF and its receptor (PAFR) significantly contribute to cancer progression and metastasis. Our findings suggest that these potent inflammatory lipids and receptor pathways are significantly involved in the early malignant transformation through PAFR-FAK-STAT 1 networking and to block apoptosis pathway in BRCA 1 dysfunctional at-risk ovarian epithelium. </p...|$|E

40|$|Weather {{and climate}} models {{requires}} global precipitation measurements because their performance {{are affected by}} the release of latent heating. Such kind of measurements is also required to facilitate management strategies for hydrology, transportation and agriculture. In the last three decades most of our understanding of global precipitation has been provided by the measurements of spaceborne passive microwaves radiometers and Ku-band radars, such as the Precipitation Radar (PR) aboard the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) satellite. Unfortunately microwave radiometers are very sensitive to the scattering of ice in the upper regions of precipitating clouds which is poorly related to surface rainfall rates, and have a reduced resolution of several kilometers. Also PR has a resolution of a few kilometers so it can miss relative small <b>precipitation</b> <b>cells.</b> A new opportunity to investigate the structure of precipitating clouds is offered by Synthetic Aperture Radars (SARs) operating at X band. Their nominal spatial resolutions is of the order of meters even if it is degraded to the order of hundreds of meters when observing precipitating clouds, due to the turbulent motion of the storm hydrometeors. X-band SAR are traditionally considered all-weather sensors but since many years spaceborne platforms has provided experimental evidences that this kind of sensor is sensitive to rainfall. The interest towards X-band SARs is witnessed by several new platforms that are currently or will soon be placed in orbit, such as COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) and the TerraSAR-X (TSX). To the purpose of characterize spaceborne X-SAR precipitation response, we have developed a theoretical and numerical model accounting for the side-looking SAR geometry in which <b>precipitation</b> <b>cells</b> are produced by simulations of the System for Atmospheric Modeling (SAM) model.

40|$|In a dry {{convective}} boundary layer, convective {{patterns of}} typical scales spontaneously develop, qualitatively {{similar to those}} in a fluid which is placed between two horizontal plates and sufficiently heated from below. As soon as precipitating cumulus clouds form, this pattern is disturbed and a transition to a different state occurs. Here we use idealized large-eddy simulations to explore how the horizontal scale of convection is modified during this transition {{in the course of a}} diurnal cycle. Before onset of <b>precipitation,</b> <b>cells</b> with relatively constant diameter self-organize, with diameters roughly on the scale of the atmospheric boundary layer height. We find that the onset of precipitation then signals an approximately linear increase in horizontal scale with time. For our transient simulations, this scale increase progresses at a speed which is relatively insensitive to modifications in mean surface temperature, modifications in the rate at which surface temperature changes, or the initial lapse rate. When exploring the strength of the spatial correlations, we find that precipitation onset causes a sudden disruption of order and a subsequent decline of organization-until precipitation eventually ceases.

Joint and conditional probabilities of precipitation at two or more stations are also examined. An extension of the model is presented in which uncertainty regarding the density of cells is expressed as an elementary probability density, and the effects of this on the expected point and area precipitation probabilities are shown.

40|$|A {{methodology}} of exploratory data analysis investigating {{the phenomenon of}} orographic precipitation enhancement is proposed. The precipitation observations obtained from three Swiss Doppler weather radars are analysed for the major precipitation event of August 2005 in the Alps. Image processing techniques are used to detect significant precipitation cells/pixels from radar images while filtering out spurious effects due to ground clutter. The contribution of topography to precipitation patterns is described by an extensive set of topographical descriptors computed from the digital elevation model at multiple spatial scales. Additionally, the motion vector field is derived from subsequent radar images and integrated into a set of topographic features to highlight the slopes exposed to main flows. Following the exploratory data analysis with a recent algorithm of spectral clustering, it is shown that orographic <b>precipitation</b> <b>cells</b> are generated under specific flow and topographic conditions.

Geographical locations with topographic characteristics favorable to enforce repeatable and persistent orographic precipitation such as stationary cells, upslope rainfall enhancement, and repeated convective initiation are detected by analyzing the spatial distribution {{of a set of}} <b>precipitation</b> <b>cells</b> extracted from radar imagery. Topographic features such as terrain convexity and gradients computed from the DEM at multiple spatial scales as well as velocity fields estimated from sequences of weather radar images are used as explanatory factors to describe the occurrence of localized precipitation enhancement.

Both two-class and one-class support vector machine classifiers are tested to separate the presumed orographic cells from the nonorographic ones in the space of contributing topographic and flow features. Site-based validation is carried out to estimate realistic generalization skills of the obtained spatial prediction models.

The precipitation events are mainly located in areas where coastal mountain ranges and rivers enhance convergence though the interaction of nocturnal mesoscale and local flows (land breeze, katabatic and drainages winds) with prevailing synoptic wind or with other mesoscale and local flows. The methodology used here to study this phenomenon consists of three stages. First, the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) radar satellite database is used to detect nocturnal precipitation near the coastline, from 18 to 09 UTC. An event {{is included in the}} study if the 3 hours accumulated precipitation detected by TRMM is stationary near the coast, or has moved slightly onshore or offshore, and has lasted no more than six consecutive hours. Second, the NCEP reanalysis database is used to describe the synoptic conditions and to discard precipitation associated with synoptic events (large low pressure areas, dynamic polar fronts, or troughs, for example). In the final step by using the version 3 of the Weather Research Forecast model, we simulate and analyse some of the selected events to determine the role of the land sea temperature differences, the curvature of the coastline and the sea surface temperature. The simulations confirm that the nocturnal precipitation studied in the Mediterranean basin near the coastline is formed from the interaction between relatively warm and wet sea-air with the cold air mass from drainage winds, {{as well as from the}} convergence of several drainage winds offshore.

In {{an attempt to}} improve their longitudinal shear strength, several directionally solidified eutectic alloy compositions with minor element modifications were pact, carburized, and heat treated to provide selective carbide <b>precipitation</b> at the <b>cell</b> and grain boundaries. The directionally solidified Ni- 17. 8 Nb- 6 Cr- 2. 5 Al- 3 Ta (weight percent) alloy was selected for the shear strength evaluation because it showed the shallowest delta-denuded zone at the carburized surface. The carburization-carbide precipitation treatment, however, did not appear to improve the longitudinal shear strength of the alloy.

40|$|The {{constitutive}} {{proliferation and}} resistance to differentiation and apoptosis of neoplastic cervical cells depend on sustained expression of human papillomavirus oncogenes. Inhibition of these oncogenes is a goal {{for the prevention of}} progression of HPV-induced neoplasias to cervical cancer. SiHa cervical cancer cells were transfected with an HPV- 16 promoter reporter construct and treated with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a human cytokine of the interleukin 6 superfamily. SiHa and CaSki cervical cancer cells were also assessed for proliferation by MTT <b>precipitation,</b> programmed <b>cell</b> death by flow cytometry, and HPV E 6 and E 7 expression by real-time PCR. LIF-treated cervical cancer cells showed significantly reduced HPV LCR activation, reduced levels of E 6 and E 7 mRNA, and reduced proliferation. We report the novel use of LIF to inhibit viral oncogene expression in cervical cancer cells, with concomitant reduction in proliferation suggesting re-engagement of cell-cycle regulation...|$|R
40|$|A {{fluorescent}} pseudomonad (strain CW- 96 - 1) {{isolated from}} a deep-sea vent sample grew at 30 degrees C under aerobic conditions in an artificial seawater medium and tolerated cadmium concentrations up to 5 mM. After 140 h, strain CW- 96 - 1 removed > 99 % of the cadmium from solution. Energy dispersive microanalysis {{revealed that the}} cadmium was removed by <b>precipitation</b> on the <b>cell</b> wall; sulfide production was confirmed by growth on Kligler's agar. Based on 16 S ribosomal DNA sequencing and fatty acid analysis, the microorganism {{is closely related to}} Pseudomonas aeruginosa...|$|R
