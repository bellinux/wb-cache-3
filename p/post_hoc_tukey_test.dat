40|$|Background. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to compare the viability of autogenous bone grafts, harvested using different methods, {{in order to determine the}} best harvesting technique with respect to more viable cells. Methods. In this animal experimental study, three harvesting methods, including manual instrument (chisel), rotary device and piezosurgery, were used for harvesting bone grafts from the lateral body of the mandible on the left and right sides of 10 rabbits. In each group, 20 bone samples were collected and their viability was assessed using MTS kit. Statistical analyses, including ANOVA and <b>post</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>Tukey</b> <b>tests,</b> were used for evaluating significant differences between the groups. Results. One-way ANOVA showed significant differences between all the groups (P= 0. 000). Data analysis using <b>post</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>Tukey</b> <b>tests</b> indicated that manual instrument and piezosurgery had no significant differences with regard to cell viability (P= 0. 749) and the cell viability in both groups was higher than that with the use of a rotary instrument (P= 0. 000).

30|$|All {{statistical}} analyses {{were carried out}} using R (Core Team 2016). We used the cor.test function to investigate Pearson’s product moment correlations between variables. We tested for differences in match scores between perspectives using ANOVA with pair-wise <b>post</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>Tukey’s</b> <b>tests</b> using the TukeyHSD function. Effect sizes, reflected by Hedge’s g, were estimated using the cohen.d and hedges.correction functions in the effsize package (Torchiano 2015). We tested for relationships between instructor and course characteristics with match scores using t tests and ANOVAs.|$|R
30|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, these metrics can {{be analyzed}} like other social science data. As {{we were interested in}} comparisons among groups (i.e., leaders and non-leaders), we used ANOVAs to determine if there were any statistically significant difference among groups. ANOVAs were used instead of t tests because as we will discuss in the next section, we had three categories. We used <b>post</b> <b>hoc</b> tests to determine which two groups had statistically significant differences. <b>Post</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>Tukey</b> <b>tests</b> were used when variance was equal and Games-Howell when it was not.|$|R
30|$|In {{the case}} of the in vitro {{assessment}} of enzyme activity, ANOVA and <b>post</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>Tukey</b> <b>test</b> were used to determine statistical differences between different concentrations.

40|$|Land cover type is an {{important}} signature that is usually used to understand {{the interaction between the}} ground surfaces with the local temperature. Various land cover types such as high density built up areas, vegetation, bare land and water bodies are areas where heat signature are measured using remote sensing image. The aim {{of this study is to}} analyse the impact of land surface temperature on land cover types. The objectives are 1) to analyse the mean temperature for each land cover types and 2) to analyse the relationship of temperature variation within land cover types: built up area, green area, forest, water bodies and bare land. The method used in this research was supervised classification for land cover map and mono window algorithm for land surface temperature (LST) extraction. The statistical analysis of <b>post</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>Tukey</b> <b>test</b> was used on an image captured on five available images. A pixel-based change detection was applied to the temperature and land cover images. The result of <b>post</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>Tukey</b> <b>test</b> for the images showed that these land cover types: built up-green, built up-forest, built up-water bodies have caused significant difference in the temperature variation. However, built up-bare land did not show significant impact at p 2 = 0. 53.

To analyse the relative expressions of RAGE, take-off points and PCR reaction efficiencies of each sample were imported from ‘Comparative Quantitation’ feature of Rotor-Gene Q into the REST-RG© Version 3 where the expression ratios of target (treatment group) to calibrator (control group) were calculated.
