5|$|Jean-Marie Le Pen {{announced}} in September 2008 {{that he would}} retire as FN president in 2010. Le Pen's daughter Marine Le <b>Pen</b> <b>and</b> FN executive vice-president Bruno Gollnisch campaigned for the presidency to succeed Le Pen, with Marine's candidacy backed by her father. On 15 January 2011, {{it was announced that}} Marine Le Pen had received the two-thirds vote needed to become the new leader of the FN. She sought to transform the FN into a mainstream party by softening its xenophobic image. Opinion polls showed the party's popularity increase under Marine Le <b>Pen,</b> <b>and</b> in the 2011 cantonal elections the party won 15% of the overall vote (up from 4.5% in 2008). However, due to the French electoral system, the party only won 2 of the 2,026 seats up for election.|$|E
5|$|By 1472, {{at the age}} of twenty, Leonardo {{qualified}} as a master in the Guild of Saint Luke, the guild of artists and doctors of medicine, but even after his father set him up in his own workshop, his attachment to Verrocchio was such that he continued to collaborate with him. Leonardo's earliest known dated work is a drawing in <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> ink of the Arno valley, drawn on 5 August 1473.|$|E

5|$|By March 1905, Potter {{was anxious}} to begin work on the tale. She thought the 1903 version too thin and rewrote the entire story, {{retaining}} Ribby the cat and Duchess the dog as the central characters while elaborating the setting and developing a stronger plot line. It was decided the tale would be published in a format slightly larger than her previous productions with ten full-colour illustrations and other illustrations in <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> sepia ink.|$|E
5|$|Cott's {{account of}} all this (illustrated by his own <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> ink drawings) is the 550-page book Adaptive Coloration in Animals (1940).

Without this step, the tip of the needle better retains its sharpness and lubrication for a more comfortable injection.|$|R
5|$|According to Filitti, the war {{spelled out}} {{the end of}} Romania's aristocratic order, leaving the country prey to the nouveaux riches and the neo-Jacobins. As the Conservative Party itself {{collapsed}} into obscurity, he remained largely {{cut off from the}} outside world, and rejected many of the recent innovations. Reportedly, he wrote all his books and articles in dip <b>pen,</b> <b>and</b> never watched a motion picture. After 1919, he had to recover from financial ruin, having entrusted the bulk of his assets (what had not been lost in the war) to a broker, who gambled it away and then committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|Around 1925, {{having had}} little success in Batavia, Andjar moved to Padang, {{where he was}} a {{reporter}} for the daily Sinar Soematera. At the same time, he worked with the city's Padangsche Opera, writing stage plays. In contrast to the standard musical theatre of the time, bangsawan, he promoted a more natural style, using dialogue instead of song to convey the story; he referred to this as toneel, based on the Dutch word for theatre. Among the works he wrote for the Padangsche Opera were adaptations of Melati van Agam, a 1923 work by Swan <b>Pen,</b> <b>and</b> Sitti Nurbaya, a 1922 novel by Marah Roesli. These works were well received.|$|E
5|$|At {{a conference}} in 2011, the two new leaders of the FN and the FPÖ, Marine Le <b>Pen</b> <b>and</b> Heinz-Christian Strache, {{announced}} deeper cooperation between their parties. Pursuing her de-demonization policy, in October 2011, Marine Le Pen, as new president of the National Front, joined the European Alliance for Freedom (EAF). The EAF is a pan-European sovereigntist platform founded late 2010 that is recognized by the European Parliament. The EAF has individual members linked to the Austrian Freedom Party of Heinz-Christian Strache, the UK Independence Party, and other movements such as the Sweden Democrats, Vlaams Belang (Belgian Flanders), Germany (Bürger in Wut), and Slovakia (Slovak National Party).|$|E

5|$|Following {{the murder}} of Jon Snow, his dire-wolf Ghost begins to howl as the sun rises above Castle Black, {{attracting}} the attention of Davos Seaworth, Eddison Tollett, {{and a few other}} loyalists. They release Ghost from his nearby <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> take Jon's body into a store-room, whereupon Melisandre briefly visits and is troubled, as she had experienced a vision in the flames where Jon was fighting at Winterfell. The loyalists become fearful and also lock themselves in from the mutineers, with the exception of Edd, who sneaks out of Castle Black to get assistance from the Wildlings against the mutineers.|$|E
5|$|Hunter focused {{for much}} of his life on landscapes and on still lifes, working in both <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> ink and oil on canvas. His still lifes of fruit are {{particularly}} distinctive, but he also painted a variety of landscapes, especially of Scotland and France. In his earlier paintings, Hunter was influenced by Cézanne to produce domestic landscapes. Later, however, in common with {{the other members of the}} Scottish colourists movement, he was heavily influenced by contemporary French artists like Monet and Matisse, and his paintings began to make bolder and more energetic use of colour.|$|E
5|$|In 1900, Potter revised a {{tale about}} a rabbit named Peter {{she had written}} for a child in 1893, and {{prepared}} a dummy book of it in imitation of Helen Bannerman's 1889 best-seller The Story of Little Black Sambo. Unable to find a buyer, she published the book {{for family and friends}} at her own expense in December 1901. Frederick Warne & Co. had earlier rejected the tale, but, anxious to compete in the booming small format children's book market, reconsidered and accepted it following the recommendation of their prominent children's book artist L. Leslie Brooke. Potter agreed to colour the <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> ink illustrations of the private edition, and chose the then-new Hentschel three-colour process for reproducing her watercolours. On 2 October 1902 The Tale of Peter Rabbit was released.|$|E

Two of his early, {{abstract}} <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> ink drawings are in the Guggenheim collection. The first recorded exhibition of Koppelman's work {{was held in the}} Lounge Gallery of the Eighth Street Playhouse in 1942, and included drawings, paintings, and sculpture. The following year, he had a solo exhibition at the Outlines Gallery in Pittsburgh.|$|E
5|$|June Kim, {{the author}} and {{illustrator}} for 12 Days, primarily drew the artwork in the realism style, although she occasionally rendered characters as super-deformed versions of themselves. While the cover art incorporates red and silver coloring, the artwork primarily appears in black and white, with occasional gray shading. Kim used <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> ink as the artistic medium, then toned her art with the software application ComicStudio. For the narrative, she explores the characters' pasts through dreams, and periodic, nonlinear flashbacks. Several character traits, such as Jackie's chocolate allergy, are presented to the reader through inference rather than exposition. Additionally, Kim uses a brief, untranslated Korean song alongside the predominantly English text.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Steinitz stands {{high as a}} {{theoretician}} and as a writer; he has {{a powerful}} <b>pen,</b> <b>and</b> when he chooses can use expressive English.

Possessed of a fine intellect, and extremely fond of the game, he is apt to lose sight of all other considerations, people and business alike. Chess is his very life and soul, the one thing for which he lives.|$|E
