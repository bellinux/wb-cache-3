Meanwhile, contrary to an implied goal of GARA, average general aviation aircraft prices continued to rise. This was largely attributable to the shift of GA manufacturers towards building high-end turbine (turboprop and jet) business and luxury aircraft, while keeping piston aircraft productions at {{a small fraction of}} their 1970s levels. The manufacturers were able to get increased income with smaller numbers of far-more-expensive airplanes (see graph).|$|E

40|$|In nonequilibrium steady states, the {{probabilities of}} the time-reversed paths differ in general {{from the path}} probabilities and they {{decrease}} at different rates given, respectively, by the time-reversed and standard entropies per unit time. These quantities characterize temporal disorder in the time-reversed paths and the paths themselves. The difference between these quantities gives the thermodynamic entropy <b>production</b> <b>in</b> <b>units</b> of Boltzmann's constant. Out of equilibrium, the temporal disorder of the time-reversed paths {{turns out to be}} larger than the temporal disorder of the paths themselves. In this way, a theorem is obtained according to which the temporal order of the paths is greater than for the time-reversed paths. The temporal disorder or dynamical randomness of the paths and their time-reversal have large-deviation properties directly connected to the thermodynamic entropy production. To cite this article: P.

40|$|It is {{necessary}} to know the production variability of experimental units in a protected environment, {{both in terms of}} space and throughout different harvests. This knowledge helps reduce experimental error and increases result reliability in combination with the adoption of appropriate experimental techniques and cultural management. The objective {{of this study was to}} characterize the spatial and temporal independence of Italian Zucchini fruit production as cultivated in a protected environment. The study used production data from exploratory experiments under protected cultivation in the Department of Plant Sciences of the Federal University of Santa Maria. Different units sizes were simulated on the basis of known production values for the number of plants per row. To verify the independence or randomness of fruit production, a test run was applied to the units within the rows of individual and grouped harvests and in the same unit between individual and grouped harvests. There was a greater randomness of <b>production</b> <b>in</b> <b>units</b> with a higher number of plants. Using a lower number of harvests randomizes the production of units as the harvests are carried out. Groupings of harvests and units formed by four and five basic units are the most efficient combination for reducing non-randomness in the production of Italian Zucchinis. ...|$|E

40|$|Azokh Cave is a Middle Pleistocene to Holocene site {{located in}} Nagorno Karabagh (Lesser Caucasus). The main entrance, Azokh 1, {{is a large}} cave that has two {{geological}} sequences (lower and upper) with nine geo-archaeological units of which only the upper ones (Units I to V) have a significant archaeological record.   The faunal remains and lithic artefacts <b>in</b> these <b>units</b> indicate aspects of human occupation, and exploitation of, and association with animals.      The lithic artefacts presented here were recovered from Units V, III and II during the 2002 – 2009 excavation seasons. The available chronological data indicates an age between 293 – 100 Ka for these units. The operational chain is incomplete and artefacts found in the cave are primarily end-products dominated by flake-tools. The assemblage of Unit V is composed primarily of simple, unretouched flakes with a minimal presence of retouched flakes and cores. The Unit II lithic assemblage includes a substantial Levallois component, although with fewer cores and retouched flakes. There are very few flake tools <b>in</b> <b>Unit</b> III. While it is still difficult to assign the Unit V assemblage to a techno-typological group or complex (i. e. Acheulean, Mousterian or other local techno-complexes such as the Kudarian), the Unit II assemblage is clearly associated with Mode 3 or the Mousterian techno-complex. Different local and non-local raw materials were exploited <b>in</b> all <b>units</b> {{for the production of}} lithic artefacts, although the range of raw materials is more varied <b>in</b> <b>Unit</b> II. Local chert, flint and basalt were used most commonly, probably due to their easy accessibility. Limestone, jasper and sandstone, from local and non-local sources, are present in small quantities <b>in</b> <b>Units</b> V and II. Obsidian is the only raw material that possibly originates from more distant sources. Flint and chert appear to have been preferentially exploited for flake tool <b>production</b> <b>in</b> all <b>units,</b> but the toolmakers show a preference for better quality raw material (flint, basalt, obsidian) for retouched pieces <b>in</b> <b>Units</b> V and II, and for Levallois <b>production</b> <b>in</b> <b>Unit</b> II. </p...|$|R

The impact of Technical and Vocational Education and the way skills training and competences are learnt in developing countries can improve polytechnic education of which Fashion is one.
