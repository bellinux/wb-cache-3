50|$|<b>Pan</b> <b>Head</b> (born Anthony Johnson, 1966, Saint Mary Parish, Jamaica, died October 10th, 1993, Marverly, St. Andrew) was a ragga/dancehall deejay.|$|E
5000|$|For example, when specifying a screw, it {{is easier}} to refer to [...] "HSC0424PP" [...] than saying [...] "Hardware, screw, machine, 4-40, 3/4" [...] long, <b>pan</b> <b>head,</b> Phillips". In this example, [...] "HSC0424PP" [...] is the part number, and it may be prefixed in {{database}} fields as [...] "PN HSC0424PP" [...] or [...] "P/N HSC0424PP".|$|E
50|$|Some {{specialist}} <b>pan</b> <b>heads,</b> {{such as the}} Induro PHQ series, {{offer up}} to five axes of rotation, {{two of them in}} parallel with the other axes.|$|R
50|$|A geared <b>head</b> takes a <b>pan</b> and tilt <b>head</b> {{and adds}} gears {{to each of}} the axes. They {{typically}} have a release on each axis to allow for rough positioning the camera, and geared controls then allow small adjustments to finesse composition. They are typically heavier than ball or <b>pan</b> <b>heads</b> due to the weight of the mechanisms.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pan</b> <b>heads</b> can be {{used for}} panoramas, but suffer from the {{deficiency}} that the axes of rotation normally do not go through the entrance pupil of the lens and thus can give rise to problems with parallax. A better choice for panoramas is a custom-built panoramic tripod head.|$|R
50|$|A <b>pan</b> <b>head,</b> {{also called}} pan and tilt head, allows {{independent}} {{rotation of the}} camera {{about two or three}} perpendicular axes, which normally do not intersect. Typical pan heads have lockable levers for each axis, a scale marked in degrees at least for the vertical axis, and one or more spirit levels. This construction is significantly more complicated than that of a ball head.|$|E

50|$|David Young and Rick Michaels formed their tag team Bad Attitude in National Championship Wrestling (NCW) in 1999. They won the NCW Tag Team Championship on October 30, {{defeating}} Boogaloo Crew (J.C. Dazz and Scottie Wrenn). On November 20, Bad Attitude {{lost the}} tag title to Road Hoggs (Joe Harley and <b>Pan</b> <b>Head</b> Nelson) in a unification {{match for the}} NCW Tag Team Championship and the NWA Georgia Tag Team Championship. NCW became NWA Wildside and Bad Attitude continued to team in the promotion.|$|E
50|$|Rivets need to {{be harder}} than the {{materials}} being joined, they are heat treated to various levels of hardness depending on the materials ductility and hardness. Rivets come {{in a range of}} diameters and lengths depending on the materials being joined; head styles are either flush countersunk or <b>pan</b> <b>heads.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Pan</b> <b>Head's</b> death {{shocked the}} music {{community}} in Kingston, and prompted several performers to record tributes; Capleton recorded [...] "Cold Blooded Murderer", Buju Banton released the single [...] "Murderer", and Beenie Man and Luciano collaborated on [...] "No Mama No Cry", which went to {{number one in}} Jamaica in 1994.|$|R
50|$|In 1994 he {{was elected}} Senator of Chihuahua in {{conjunction}} with Martha Lara Alatorre, beating the formula postulated by the National Action Party (<b>PAN),</b> <b>headed</b> by Luis H. Alvarez. In 2004 he beat the PAN candidate, Cruz Perez Cuellar, {{in the race for}} mayor, making him the first PRI winning candidate in 12 years.|$|R
5000|$|Season 1, Episodes 8&9 Original Airdates 06/16/03 06/30/03Based {{around a}} Harley Davidson replica frame, the Old School Chopper has an [...] <b>pan</b> <b>head</b> motor that {{delivers}} [...] through a chain {{drive to the}} back wheel. It also features a springer front end, sportster style tank, old style ape hanger handlebars and Jockey shift/Suicide clutch. Detailing includes a deep maroon paint job and gold-leaf accenting. Most of the fabrication on this bike was done by OCC's former student intern, Cody Connelly, as a joint project with Paul Sr. Despite the bike being presented to Connelly {{at the end of}} the episode, it was later returned to OCC and became the subject of a lawsuit claim by Connelly.|$|E
50|$|They {{are almost}} always {{provided}} with a #2 Phillips drive. Sometimes a Torx drive is used instead. Both Phillips and Torx patterns may also be combined with a slot for a flat-blade screwdriver. Usually they are provided with a 1/4 in (0.25 in) flanged hex head. Non-standard metricized 5.5 mm flanged hex heads can also be encountered. Also common are <b>pan</b> <b>head</b> screws - a low disk with a chamfered outer edge. Because they are used in places where high torque is not required and easy removal and replacement may be desirable (such as on the side panels of the PC case), they are frequently available as thumbscrews with larger, knurled heads that can be removed with one's fingers or tools.|$|E
5000|$|The {{international}} backlash to Banton's violently anti-homosexual [...] "Boom Bye-Bye", and {{the reality}} of Kingston's violence which saw the deaths of deejays <b>Pan</b> <b>Head</b> and Dirtsman saw another shift, this time back towards Rastafari and cultural themes, with several of the hardcore slack ragga artists finding religion, and the [...] "conscious ragga" [...] scene becoming an increasingly popular movement. A new generation of singers and deejays emerged that harked back to the roots reggae era, notably Garnett Silk, Tony Rebel, Sanchez, Luciano, Anthony B and Sizzla. Some popular deejays, most prominently Buju Banton and Capleton, began to cite Rastafari and turn their lyrics and music in a more conscious, rootsy direction. Many modern dancehall Rasta artists identify with Bobo Ashanti.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Pan</b> <b>Head</b> {{emerged in}} 1985, and after working {{for several years}} with the Love Vibration and Scorpio sound systems, he {{released}} his first single, [...] "Gimme Lickle Lovin'" [...] in 1988. Early releases such as [...] "Respect Gunman", [...] "Punny Printer", and [...] "Gunman Tune" [...] were immediately popular in Jamaica. As his popularity grew, he performed {{with the likes of}} Buju Banton, Beenie Man, and Capleton. Earlier themes of violence and homophobia gave way in 1993 to more mature subject matter with [...] "African Princess", [...] "Under Bondage", and [...] "Teaser". Although he was predicted to be a major star, his career was cut short when he was shot dead as he left a dance in Spanish Town in October 1993, leaving a widow and two children. The crime has never been solved.|$|E
5000|$|Banton's lyrics often {{dealt with}} violence, which he {{explained}} as reflecting {{the images that}} young Jamaicans were presented with by the news media, but the reality of Kingston's violence was brought home in 1993 by the murders in separate incidents of three {{of his friends and}} fellow recording artists, the deejays <b>Pan</b> <b>Head</b> and Dirtsman and singer Mickey Simpson. His response was the single [...] "Murderer", which condemned gun violence, going against the flow of the prevailing lyrical content in dancehall. The song inspired several clubs to stop playing songs with excessively violent subject matter. Late in 1994, Buju was also affected by the death of his friend Garnett Silk. Buju's transformation continued, embracing the Rastafari movement and growing dreadlocks. He joined [...] "conscious" [...] deejay Tony Rebel, Papa San, and General Degree in the Yardcore Collective. His performances and musical releases took on a more spiritual tone. Banton toured Europe and Japan, playing sold out shows.|$|E
5000|$|Young, dubbed [...] "The Messiah of the Spinebuster", {{spent his}} early career in National Championship Wrestling as a singles wrestler {{before joining the}} team Body Count with [...] "Heavy Metal" [...] Ric Savage. Young and Savage feuded with Rusty Riddle and Kid Kash for the National Championship Wrestling world tag-team titles. Young stayed with NCW as it grew into NWA Wildside where Young became known as a tag team specialist, teaming with Shane Austin as [...] "The Sex Pistols". On August 19, 1999 The Sex Pistols {{defeated}} Bart Sawyer and Terry Lawler in Loganville, Georgia for the NWA Wildside (Georgia) Tag Team Championship. On November 4, Austin was replaced by Rick Michaels, with Young and Michaels naming themselves Bad Attitude. On November 20, 1999 in Cornelia, Georgia, Young and Michaels lost the Tag Team Championships to The Road Hoggs (Joe Harley and <b>Pan</b> <b>Head</b> Nelson). Bad Attitude continued to pursue the Wildside Tag Team Championships, and on January 11, 2000 they defeated The Underdogs (Mark E. Mark and Big Eddie Cool) for the NWA Wildside Tag Team Championship, which they held until February 19, when they were defeated by The Rock 'n' Roll Express. Bad Attitude reclaimed the Tag Team Titles on June 17 in a {{two out of three}} falls match, making Young a three time NWA Wildside Tag Team Champion.|$|E

40|$|This paper details {{experiments}} in which neural network controllers were evolved in simulation that allowed a simple <b>panning</b> camera <b>head</b> to track patterned objects moving against similarly patterned backgrounds in reality. It {{begins with a}} discussion of minimal simulations: fast-running, easy-to-build simulations for the evolution of real robot controllers (Jakobi, 1998 a; Jakobi, 1998 b). The minimal simulation with which the motion-tracking controllers were evolved (along {{with the rest of the}} evolutionary machinery) is then described. Experimental results are offered in which an evolved controller was downloaded onto a simple <b>panning</b> camera <b>head</b> and satisfactorily tracked two very differently patterned objects as they moved against similarly patterned backgrounds in a random fashion. 1.
