25|$|Undernourishment is {{most often}} due to not enough {{high-quality}} food being available to eat. This is often related to high food prices and poverty. A lack of breastfeeding may contribute, as may a number of infectious diseases such as: gastroenteritis, pneumonia, malaria, and measles, which increase nutrient requirements. There are two main types of undernutrition: <b>protein-energy</b> <b>malnutrition</b> and dietary deficiencies. <b>Protein-energy</b> <b>malnutrition</b> has two severe forms: marasmus (a lack of protein and calories) and kwashiorkor (a lack of just protein). Common micronutrient deficiencies include: a lack of iron, iodine, and vitamin A. During pregnancy, due to the body's increased need, deficiencies may become more common. In some developing countries, overnutrition {{in the form of}} obesity is beginning to present within the same communities as undernutrition. Other causes of malnutrition include anorexia nervosa and bariatric surgery.|$|E
25|$|In {{emergency}} situations {{where there is}} a lack of nutritious food, but not to the level of a true famine, <b>protein-energy</b> <b>malnutrition</b> is most common among young children. Marasmus, a form of calorie deficiency, is the most common form of childhood malnutrition and is characterised by severe wasting and often fatal weakening of the immune system. Kwashiorkor, a form of calorie and protein deficiency, is a more serious type of malnutrition in young children, and can negatively affect physical and mental development. Both types of malnutrition can make opportunistic infections fatal. In these situations, MSF sets up Therapeutic Feeding Centres for monitoring the children and any other malnourished individuals.|$|E
25|$|Helminthiasis {{may cause}} chronic illness through {{malnutrition}} including vitamin deficiencies, stunted growth, anemia, and <b>protein-energy</b> <b>malnutrition.</b> Worms compete directly with their hosts for nutrients, but {{the magnitude of}} this effect is likely minimal as the nutritional requirements of worms is relatively small. In pigs and humans, Ascaris has been linked to lactose intolerance and vitamin A, amino acid, and fat malabsorption. Impaired nutrient uptake may result from direct damage to the intestinal mucosal wall or from more subtle changes such as chemical imbalances and changes in gut flora. Alternatively, the worms’ release of protease inhibitors to defend against the body’s digestive processes may impair the breakdown of other nutrients. In addition, worm induced diarrhoea may shorten gut transit time, thus reducing absorption of nutrients.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: <b>Protein-energy</b> and {{micronutrient}} <b>malnutrition</b> are global {{public health}} problems which, when not prevented and severe, require medical management by clinicians with nutrition expertise, preferably as a collectively skilled team, especially when disease-related. This study aimed to investigate barriers and facilitators of clinical nutrition services (CNS), especially {{the use of}} oral, enteral (EN) and parenteral (PN) nutrition in institutional and home settings. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: An international survey was performed between January and December 2014 in twenty-six countries from all continents. Electronic questionnaires were distributed to 28 representatives of clinical nutrition (PEN) societies, 27 of whom responded. The questionnaire comprised questions regarding a country's economy, reimbursement for CNS, education about {{and the use of}} EN and PN.

40|$|Abstract Background No {{studies on}} {{continuous}} renal replacement therapy (CRRT) have analyzed nutritional status in children. The {{objective of this}} study was to assess the association between mortality and nutritional status of children receiving CRRT. Methods Prospective observational study to analyze the nutritional status of children receiving CRRT and its association with mortality. The variables recorded were age, weight, sex, diagnosis, albumin, creatinine, urea, uric acid, severity of illness scores, CRRT-related complications, duration of admission to the pediatric intensive care unit, and mortality. Results The sample comprised 174 critically ill children on CRRT. The median weight of the patients was 10 kg, 35 % were under percentile (P) 3, and 56 % had a weight/P 50 ratio of less than 0. 85. Only two patients were above P 95. The mean age for patients under P 3 was significantly lower than that of the other patients (p = 0. 03). The incidence of weight under P 3 was greater in younger children (p = 0. 007) and in cardiac patients and in those who had previous chronic renal insufficiency (p = 0. 047). The mortality analysis did not include patients with pre-existing renal disease. Mortality was 38. 9 %. Mortality for patients with weight P 3 (51 % vs 33 %; p = 0. 037). In the univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, the only factor associated with mortality was <b>protein-energy</b> wasting (<b>malnutrition)</b> (OR, 2. 11; 95 % CI, 1. 067 - 4. 173; p = 0. 032). Conclusions The frequency of protein-energy wasting in children who require CRRT is high, and the frequency of obesity is low. Protein-energy wasting is more frequent in children with previous end-stage renal disease and heart disease. Underweight children present a higher mortality rate than patients with normal body weight. </p...|$|R
25|$|Over 90% {{of deaths}} from diarrheal {{diseases}} {{in the developing}} world today occur in children under 5 years old. Malnutrition, especially <b>protein-energy</b> <b>malnutrition,</b> can decrease the children's resistance to infections, including water-related diarrheal diseases. From 2000 to 2003, 769,000 children under five years old in sub-Saharan Africa died each year from diarrheal diseases. As a result of only thirty-six percent of the population in the sub-Saharan region having access to proper means of sanitation, more than 2000 children's lives are lost every day. In South Asia, 683,000 children under five years old died each year from diarrheal disease from 2000 to 2003. During the same time period, in developed countries, 700 children under five years old died from diarrheal disease. Improved water supply reduces diarrhea morbidity by twenty-five percent and improvements in drinking water through proper storage in the home and chlorination reduces diarrhea episodes by thirty-nine percent.|$|E
25|$|There were 793million undernourished {{people in}} the world in 2015 (13% of the total population). This is a {{reduction}} of 216million people since 1990 when 23% were undernourished. In 2012 it was estimated that another billion people had a lack of vitamins and minerals. In 2015, <b>protein-energy</b> <b>malnutrition</b> was estimated to have resulted in 323,000 deaths—down from 510,000 deaths in 1990. Other nutritional deficiencies, which include iodine deficiency and iron deficiency anemia, result in another 83,000 deaths. In 2010, malnutrition was the cause of 1.4% of all disability adjusted life years. About a third of deaths in children are believed to be due to undernutrition, although the deaths are rarely labelled as such. In 2010, it was estimated to have contributed to about 1.5 million deaths in women and children, though some estimate the number may be greater than 3million. An additional 165million children were estimated to have stunted growth from malnutrition in 2013. Undernutrition is more common in developing countries. Certain groups have higher rates of undernutrition, including women—in particular while pregnant or breastfeeding—children under five years of age, and the elderly. In the elderly, undernutrition becomes more common due to physical, psychological, and social factors.|$|E

40|$|Roughly {{half of the}} Earth’s seven {{billion people}} rely on rice as their primary source of food. The milled grain of rice, often {{referred}} to as polished or white rice, serves as a rich source of energy but is low in protein and several essential micronutrients such as iron and zinc. As a result, billions of people in rice-based countries suffer the debilitating effects of <b>protein-energy</b> and micronutrient <b>malnutrition</b> with symptoms including iron-deficiency anaemia, growth retardation and blindness. By 2050, the Earth’s atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration ([CO 2]) is expected to reach 550 μmol mol– 1, representing a 70 % increase from today’s concentration of 392 μmol mol– 1. The impacts of elevated [CO 2] on plant growth will likely include agronomically useful traits such as increased biomass, yield and water-use efficiency. However, increased plant productivity is likely to be accompanied by decreased protein and micronutrient mineral concentrations of cereal grain. This review focuses on the effects of carbon dioxide-enrichment on rice physiology and nutritional composition and proposes increased activity of the Strategy II iron uptake pathway as a promising method to maintain or increase iron and zinc concentrations in rice grain, and perhaps cereal grain in general, under elevated [CO 2].
