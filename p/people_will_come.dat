25|$|The Qur'an cannot {{deal with}} the State of Israel {{as we know it}} today, since that State came into {{existing}} in 1948 only, i.e. many centuries after the Qur'an itself was revealed. However, the Qur'an specifies that the Land of Israel is the homeland of the Jewish people, that God Himself gave that Land to them as heritage and ordered them to live therein. It also announces that – {{before the end of the}} time – the Jewish <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>come</b> from many different countries to retake possession of that heritage of theirs. Whoever denies this actually denies the Qur'an itself. If he is not a scholar, and in good faith believes what other people say about this issue, he is an ignorant Muslim. If, on the contrary, he is informed about what the Qur'an and openly opposes it, he ceases to be a Muslim.|$|E

He also watched hours of footage of previous episodes {{to get an idea of}} how to portray Declan, then making a statement to Declan fans reading: [...] "I'm sure that initially people will be quite confronted by a new face with the same character name – I'm not fooling myself about that. But hopefully <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>come</b> to accept it." [...] Mullally has compared the two versions of Declan saying [...] "One of the writers said to me in a meeting the other day that the changeover between James and me can be best described as James playing Declan as very strong, macho. He liked to get into things and was very proactive. [...] "The new Declan is more grown up, quite mature and savvy. He thinks with his head and knows what he wants and doesn't have to use brute force to get it." [...] During Rebecca's vision, Thomas Smith portrayed a six-year-old Declan.|$|E
500|$|Rosenblatt {{contacted}} Ed Steinberg, {{who ran the}} Rock America video {{company and}} asked him if he could spare a few hours to make a music video for [...] "Everybody" [...] with Madonna on stage at her next performance in Danceteria. The idea was to play the video as promotion across the United States so that <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>come</b> to recognize an image of Madonna and her performance. Rosenblatt offered Steinberg $1,000 for the in-house production video, when artists like Duran Duran and Michael Jackson were spending six figure sums on videos. They finally agreed on $1,500. With the low-budget, the video was directed by Steinberg. Steinberg suggested shooting the video on location at the Paradise Garage, a downtown gay disco, instead of filming a live performance. Madonna's friend Debi Mazar did the makeup and joined her other backup dancers, namely Erika Belle and Bags Rilez. Mazar brought a few of her friends to act as a disco crowd in the video, including African-American graffiti artist Michael Stewart. Steinberg was impressed by Madonna's professionalism on the set and he helped to send copies of the tape to nightclubs across America which used dance music videos for their entertainment. This promotion helped the song to grow from being a dance hit in New York to a nationwide hit.|$|E

2500|$|After the 2007 presidential election, President Lee Myung-bak {{formed a}} {{government}} of mostly close supporters. Park's supporters argued {{that this was a}} kind of political reprisal, and that they should secede from the Grand National Party. Eventually, they formed parties named Pro-Park Coalition and Solidarity for Pro-Park Independents (친박 무소속 연대; Chin Park Musosok Yeondae). Park herself did not join them, but indirectly supported them by announcing [...] "I hope these <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>come</b> back alive." [...] After the mass secession, the rebels announced that they would rejoin GNP after the general election, but the GNP prohibited it. In the following 2008 general election, the rebels won 26 seats: 14 from the Pro-Park Coalition and 12 as independents. Together, they played a pivotal role in the GNP's narrow majority. Park continually insisted that GNP should allow the return of her supporters. As of 2011, most of these rebels had returned to the GNP, resulting in approximately 50 to 60 assembly members who support Park out of 171 in the GNP.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the heart}} {{of many of the}} new schemes was {{architecture}} of poor quality or poor design, and a poor understanding {{of the effects of the}} new road network. As warned by Buchanan, the detailed implementation of many of these schemes critically affected their success or failure. Subsequent research has shown that more is needed than a pedestrian centre with glass shop fronts and a hope that <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>come</b> and social life flourish. One of the recommendations, that of integrating low level roads with developments on top, has been largely ignored; the costs and commitments needed for multi-level developments have been prohibitive in old town centres, especially when cheaper alternatives or out of town sites have presented themselves. [...] New developments were often made in a fashionable modernist or brutalist style which rapidly dated, while the planners had not fully considered the social or economic factors that could lead to urban decay. The corridor or distribution roads would often have minimal overpasses or grade separation, with communities severed or blighted by noise and fumes. Drivers would refuse to be neatly compartmentalised into [...] "travelling" [...] along the corridor roads and [...] "living" [...] on the local roads, leading to businesses closing outside the prime sites.|$|E

2500|$|Blessed Sister Mary of the Divine Heart Droste zu Vischering {{said that}} in her mystical {{experiences}} Jesus Christ inspired her to build a shrine dedicated to his Sacred Heart.

According to the writings of Sister Mary of the Divine Heart, Jesus had made this promise: [...] "I will make it a place of graces. I will distribute copiously graces to all who live in this house , those who live here now, those who will live here after, and even to their relatives." [...] Jesus also promised her: [...] "Know this, My daughter, that by the charity of My Heart I desire to pour out floods of graces through your heart over the hearts of others. This is why <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>come</b> to you with confidence; {{it will not be}} your personal qualities which will attract them, but Me.

The deed was recorded in both Counties on June 5, 1998. The former Central Hudson power lines were finally removed in 2009, as part of Walkway construction.
