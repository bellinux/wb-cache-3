5|$|At {{the time}} of the Arab Revolt and its aftermath, Aleppo's {{political}} elite was divided between those who embraced the Arab nationalist movement led by Faisal and those who sought political autonomy for Aleppo and its hinterland within the Ottoman state. A number of factors distinguished the attitudes of Aleppo's elite and populace from those of Damascus. For one, the economic well-being of Aleppo's inhabitants was dependent on open, commercial access to Aleppo's Anatolian hinterland, which was predominantly populated by Turks; southwestern Anatolia was the principal market for Aleppo's goods and the <b>principal</b> <b>supplier</b> of its food and raw materials.|$|E
5|$|The Whitechapel Bell Foundry, a <b>principal</b> <b>supplier</b> {{of church}} bells in Britain, {{is based at}} No.32–34 Whitechapel Road.

Davenant Foundation School moved to No.173 Whitechapel Road in 1818. The school expanded with a new hall and classrooms in 1896, with further improvements in 1909. However, a decreasing child population meant that in 1965, the school moved to Loughton, Essex. The building remains on the north side and is Grade II listed.|$|E

In the early 19th century Naples became the <b>principal</b> <b>supplier</b> to the Swiss, German and French textile industries, as a result of which many textile workers came from these countries to Naples. Also, the silk and cotton industries of Switzerland had been badly damaged by the blockage against Napoleon, and many entrepreneurs saw Naples as a way out of their predicament.|$|E

25|$|The 1956 Suez Crisis {{suggested}} that Britain, financially weakened by two world wars, could not then pursue {{its foreign policy}} objectives {{on an equal footing}} with the new superpowers without sacrificing convertibility of its reserve currency as a central goal of policy. As the majority of World War II had been fought far from its national boundaries, the United States had not suffered the industrial destruction nor massive civilian casualties that marked the wartime situation of the countries in Europe or Asia. The war had reinforced the position of the United States as the world's largest long-term creditor nation and its <b>principal</b> <b>supplier</b> of goods; moreover it had built up a strong industrial and technological infrastructure that had greatly advanced its military strength into a primary position on the global stage. Despite attempts to create multinational coalitions or legislative bodies (such as the United Nations), it became increasingly clear that the superpowers had very different visions about what the post-war world ought to look like, and after the withdrawal of British aid to Greece in 1947, the United States took the lead in containing Soviet expansion in the Cold War.|$|E
25|$|The Kingdom of Aksum was ideally located to take {{advantage}} of the new trading situation. Adulis soon became the main port for the export of African goods, such as ivory, incense, gold, slaves, and exotic animals. In order to supply such goods the kings of Aksum worked to develop and expand an inland trading network. A rival, and much older trading network that tapped the same interior region of Africa was that of the Kingdom of Kush, which had long supplied Egypt with African goods via the Nile corridor. By the 1st century AD, however, Aksum had gained control over territory previously Kushite. The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea explicitly describes how ivory collected in Kushite territory was being exported through the port of Adulis instead of being taken to Meroë, the capital of Kush. During the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD the Kingdom of Aksum continued to expand their control of the southern Red Sea basin. A caravan route to Egypt was established which bypassed the Nile corridor entirely. Aksum succeeded in becoming the <b>principal</b> <b>supplier</b> of African goods to the Roman Empire, not least as a result of the transformed Indian Ocean trading system.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the current study}} was to apply transaction cost economics approach to identify and quantify transaction costs and their impact on choice by <b>principal</b> agrocredit <b>suppliers</b> of the most efficient transaction contractual arrangements. Based on information from the sample of 78 agrocredit transaction contracts in Kibondo district, western Tanzania, we apply both qualitative and quantitative analytical tools to first, describe <b>principal</b> <b>suppliers</b> and institutional arrangements through which farmers access agrocredit; second to identify and quantify determinants of transaction costs involved in credit supply arrangements to smallholder farmers; and third {{to examine the relationship between}} transactions cost determinants and choice of agrocredit transaction arrangements. Five contractual transaction arrangements (CTAs) were identified and described qualitatively. Frequency distribution measures of central tendency indicated that CTAs involving intermediaries were found to have higher mean transaction costs compared to direct transaction arrangements. It was also found that there was high significant probability for more preference for private than state coordinated CTAs (a) if size of loans demanded is small; (b) if there is increase in monitoring and enforcement cost; and (c) if the distance between contracting parties increases (and vice versa for high preference of state coordinated CTAs). The logits for negotiation and enforcement costs were more significant in determining probability that private <b>principal</b> <b>suppliers</b> used CTAs with intermediaries than those without intermediarie...|$|R
