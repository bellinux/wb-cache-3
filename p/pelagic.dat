5|$|Lisa Rosenberger's 2001 phylogenetic analysis, {{based on}} morphology, {{found that the}} <b>pelagic</b> {{stingray}} {{is one of the}} more basal members of its family, being the sister taxon to a clade that contains Pastinachus, Dasyatis, and Indo-Pacific Himantura species. Other common names for the <b>pelagic</b> stingray include the blue stingray and the violet stingray.|$|E
5|$|Not much {{is known}} about the life history of hawksbills. Their life history can be divided into three phases, namely the <b>pelagic</b> phase, from {{hatching}} to about 20cm, the benthic phase, when the immature turtles recruit to foraging areas, and the reproductive phase, when they reach sexual maturity. The <b>pelagic</b> phase possibly lasts until the turtles reach around 20cm in length in 1–3 years, reaching sexual maturity at around 40cm (2–4 years).|$|E

40|$|The Omani {{coastal fishery}} is {{categorized}} into small <b>pelagics,</b> large <b>pelagics,</b> demersals, shellfishes, and sharks and rays. During the period 1994 - 2007 the small <b>pelagics</b> contributed 39 and 21 % {{to the total}} Omani fisheries landings and values respectively. During 1994 - 2007 sardines alone contributed 76 and 51 % to the total small <b>pelagics</b> landings and values, respectively. Al-Batina and Muscat regions contributed the highest to the total landings; among other Omani regions, Musandam, Muscat, and Sharqiya and Al-Wusta regions. Total sardines prices ranges from 114 to 225 Omani Rials per ton depending on where the sardines are coming from. On the other hand, Al-Batina and Muscat regions contributed {{the most in the}} total sardine values. Few gonadosomatic index studies indicated two major spawning peaks: a major one occurred during March-April and a minor one in September-October...|$|R
5|$|Teleosts {{have four}} major life stages: the egg, the larva, the {{juvenile}} and the adult. Species may begin {{life in a}} <b>pelagic</b> environment or a demersal environment (near the seabed). Most marine teleosts have <b>pelagic</b> eggs, which are light, transparent and buoyant with thin envelopes. <b>Pelagic</b> eggs rely on the ocean currents to disperse and receive no parental care. When they hatch, the larvae are planktonic and unable to swim. They have a yolk sac attached to them which provides nutrients. Most freshwater species produce demersal eggs which are thick, pigmented, relatively heavy and able to stick to substrates. Parental care is much more common among freshwater fish. Unlike their <b>pelagic</b> counterparts, demersal larvae are able to swim and feed {{as soon as they}} hatch. Larval teleosts often look very different from adults, particularly in marine species. Some larvae were even considered different species from the adults. Larvae have high mortality rates, most die from starvation or predation within their first week. As they grow, survival rates increase and there is greater physiological tolerance and sensitivity, ecological and behavioural competence.|$|E
5|$|In the Southern Hemisphere, {{commercial}} fishing for the porbeagle is mostly undocumented. Substantial numbers are caught incidentally by <b>pelagic</b> longline fisheries targeting more valuable {{species such as}} southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii), swordfish (Xiphius gladius), and Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides), including vessels operated by Japan, Uruguay, Argentina, South Africa, and New Zealand. Porbeagle catches by the Uruguayan tuna <b>pelagic</b> longline fishery peaked in 1984 with 150 tons landed. Records of catch per unit effort (CPUE) for this fishery have shown a 90% decline in porbeagle landings from 1988 to 1998, though it is uncertain whether this reflects a real population decline or changing fishing habits. New Zealand has reported annual catches of 150–300 tons, mostly of immature individuals, from 1998 to 2003.|$|E
5|$|The diet of the <b>pelagic</b> {{stingray}} {{consists of}} free-swimming invertebrates and bony fishes. It {{is an active}} hunter, using its pectoral fins to trap and move food to its mouth, and {{has been known to}} take advantage of seasonal feeding opportunities such as spawning squid. Like other stingrays, it is aplacental viviparous, meaning that the embryos are sustained initially by yolk and later by histotroph ("uterine milk"). With a short gestation period of 24 months, females may bear two litters of 413 pups per year. Birthing generally occurs in warm water near the equator, {{with the exception of the}} Mediterranean Sea, with the timing varying between regions. Rarely encountered except by fishery workers, the <b>pelagic</b> stingray can inflict a severe, even fatal wound with its tail spine. This species is caught as bycatch throughout its range; it is of little economic value and usually discarded, often with high mortality. However, there is evidence that its numbers are increasing, perhaps owing to the heavy fishing of its natural predators and competitors (e.g., sharks). Along with the <b>pelagic</b> stingray's global distribution and prolific life history, this has led the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to assess it as of Least Concern.|$|E

5|$|The <b>pelagic</b> {{stingray}} {{was originally}} described by French naturalist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in the 1832 third volume of Iconografia della fauna italica per le quattro classi degli animali vertebrati. He named it Trygon violacea, from the Latin viola ("purple"), and designated two specimens collected off Italy as the species syntypes. The genus Trygon {{has since been}} synonymized with Dasyatis. In 1910, American zoologist Henry Weed Fowler placed the <b>pelagic</b> stingray in the newly created subgenus Pteroplatytrygon, from the Greek pteron ("fin"), platus ("broad"), and trygon ("stingray"). Later authors elevated Pteroplatytrygon {{to the rank of}} full genus, though some taxonomists dispute whether this species is distinct enough to warrant separation from Dasyatis.|$|E

5|$|As the President of the United States {{refuses to}} loan dataDyne the <b>Pelagic</b> II, the conspirators plot {{to kill him}} and replace him with a dataDyne-grown clone. To {{accomplish}} their plans, an NSA strike team led by Trent Easton invades the air base from which Air Force One will depart. When Joanna foils this strike, the NSA along with some Scandinavians take over the plane itself, which crashes after an attempt to detach a craft attached to it. Having survived the crash, Joanna eliminates the President's clone and rescues the real President. Meanwhile, Easton is killed by one particular Scandinavian known as Mr. Blonde, who is revealed to be a Skedar in disguise. Without permission from the President, dataDyne decides to hijack the <b>Pelagic</b> II and reach the ancient spacecraft. However, unbeknownst to dataDyne, the Carrington Institute learns that the spacecraft contains a powerful weapon capable of destroying a planet and that the conspirators are actually Skedar aliens disguised as Scandinavian humans who intend to test the weapon on Earth before using it against the Maian homeworld.|$|E

40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the evolution}} of policy in South Africa's fishing industry using the fishery for small <b>pelagics</b> as a case study.

The analysis combines 'actor-oriented' and 'institutional' perspectives, and proposes that {{the evolution of}} policy is driven by interests, networks, alliances and discourses, which are largely determined by the power and resources that can be mustered by specific actors. A major lesson from the study is that it is particularly difficult for new entrants to influence policy for transforming capital intensive fisheries, where the need for capital, market forces and conservation ideology collude to raise the entry bar.
