5|$|Adamle quit {{football}} for good {{after the season}} and focused on his medical career. He received a medical degree from Western Reserve in 1956. He settled in Kent, Ohio, where he ran a medical <b>practice</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rest of his life. He also served as the team doctor for Theodore Roosevelt High School and Kent State University for more than 35 years. Adamle specialized in knee and neck injuries, and published articles about cold therapy {{and the use of}} Vitamin C in sports medicine. The Ohio High School Athletic Association named him the state's Outstanding Team Physician in 1983.|$|E

5|$|After the Aleutian Islands Campaign, a refit was {{undertaken}} at the Puget Sound Navy Yard. On 25 October, New Mexico returned to Pearl Harbor to <b>practice</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{invasion of the}} Gilbert Islands. On 20 November, while the invasion was under way, she shelled Makin Atoll. During the fighting on the islands the ship was tasked with guarding transports at night when they retreated from the islands, providing anti-aircraft fire for the unloading of supplies and troops, and providing screening fire for the aircraft carriers. After U.S. troops captured the Gilbert Islands on 5 December, New Mexico returned to Pearl Harbor.|$|E
5|$|As a {{fifth year}} redshirt senior {{defensive}} {{end for the}} 2009 Wisconsin Badgers he ranked second {{in the nation in}} tackles for a loss (TFLs) and second in the Big Ten Conference in quarterback sacks. For the 2009 NCAA Division I FBS football season, he earned several second team and honorable mention All-American recognitions by various publications. He was a first-team 2009 All-Big Ten Conference selection. He earned the defensive MVP award at the 2010 East–West Shrine Game, but was injured during <b>practice</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 2010 Senior Bowl the subsequent week.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1967, Favaloro began {{to consider the possibility}} of using the saphenous vein in coronary surgery. He put his ideas into <b>practice</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time in May of that year. The basic principle was to bypass a diseased (obstructed) segment in a coronary artery in order to deliver blood flow distally. The standardization of this technique, called bypass or transmyocardial revascularization surgery, was the fundamental work of his career, and ensured that his prestige would transcend the limits of his country, as the procedure radically changed the treatment of coronary disease. In 1970 he published one of his best-known volumes, Surgical Treatment of Coronary Arteriosclerosis.|$|E

5|$|Born in St. Louis, Missouri to Edward and Katherine Blake, he {{attended}} Central Catholic High School in East St. Louis, {{where he was}} a baseball teammate of Hank Bauer, and graduated in 1943. Blake pitched batting <b>practice</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> St. Louis Cardinals during the 1943 World Series after his high school graduation, in what he considered to be the highlight of his professional career. He signed with the Cardinals in 1944 and spent the season with three different minor league teams: the Columbus Red Birds of the American Association, the Allentown Cardinals of the Interstate League and the Mobile Bears of the Southern Association.|$|E
5|$|He {{returned}} to Team Penske for the 2005 season. At Phoenix in the season's second race, Hornish started {{in second place}} and won after leading for 25 laps. During <b>practice</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Indianapolis 500, he drove over a piece of debris after Paul Dana's second-turn crash and flipped over. Two days later Hornish qualified in second place, crashing out after leading for a race-high 77 laps and finishing 23rd. At the Milwaukee Mile he qualified for the pole position and led for 123 of 225 laps, passing Dario Franchitti with nine laps left for his second win of the season. Hornish {{finished third in the}} championship standings, with 512 points.|$|E
5|$|Jack Brabham used BT19 {{again at}} the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, another high speed circuit. A second BT20 was {{completed}} at the Italian track and Brabham tried it in <b>practice</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> race, but decided to race his Old Nail, which he felt was fitted with a stronger engine. As at Reims, Brabham successfully slipstreamed the race leaders early on, but an oil leakage stopped the car after 8 laps. Neither Surtees nor Stewart finished the race and Brabham clinched his third world championship.|$|E

5|$|Most gliders do {{not have}} engines or at least engines that would allow a {{take-off}} under their own power. Various methods are therefore used to get airborne. Each method requires specific training, therefore glider pilots must be in current <b>practice</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> type of launch being used. Licensing rules in some countries, such as the USA, differentiate between aerotows and ground launch methods, due to the widely different techniques.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade {{varied in}} size and {{structure}} each time it was created. Headquarters and Service Company, the company comprising the headquarters staff and support personnel, was {{much smaller than the}} equivalent company in standard Marine brigades. Each iteration of the brigade was assigned provisional military police, signal and other supporting companies and platoons. This was not an uncommon <b>practice</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Marine Corps, which created such ad hoc units regularly in wartime. During World War II two other provisional Marine brigades were formed, which eventually expanded into divisions.|$|E
5|$|The {{first day}} of <b>practice</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> American Memorial was {{scheduled}} on September 13, but was cancelled because of rain.

5|$|While {{stationed}} in Cologne, Müncheberg trained for the decathlon at the ASV Köln (sports club in Cologne) during {{his spare time}} and competed in various national and international track and field events. He even had a training field built on the family estate at Friedrichshof in Pomerania {{and at the time}} had strong ambitions to compete in the 1940 Summer Olympics. His commanding officers supported him in this athletic vision and gave him additional time off to <b>practice</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Olympics. Müncheberg owned a dachshund (Dackel), which his mother had bred, named Seppl. The dog accompanied him from the start of World War II until his death on 23 March 1943.|$|E
5|$|Although Roberts won the 250cc Grand Prix, Sheene {{claimed the}} {{victory in the}} 500cc Venezuelan Grand Prix while Roberts' Yamaha {{suffered}} a mechanical failure on the starting line. In the second round at the Spanish Grand Prix, Roberts was leading the race by eight seconds when his throttle stuck, forcing him to settle for second place behind fellow American Pat Hennen. Roberts then won his first-ever 500cc Grand Prix with a win in Austria, quickly followed by two more victories in France and Italy, along with two second-place finishes in the Netherlands and Belgium. At the 1978 Swedish Grand Prix, Roberts crashed during <b>practice</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 250cc race, sustaining a concussion and a thumb injury. Shaken up by the accident, he could do no better than seventh place in the 500cc race. Sheene had come down with a debilitating virus at the Venezuelan round, but a string of podium finishes and a victory at the Swedish Grand Prix combined with Roberts' failure to score any points in the Finnish Grand Prix, allowed him to close the points gap.|$|E
5|$|Caracciola began racing {{while he}} was working as {{apprentice}} at the Fafnir automobile factory in Aachen during the early 1920s, first on motorcycles and then in cars. Racing for Mercedes-Benz, {{he won his first}} two Hillclimbing Championships in 1930 and 1931, and moved to Alfa Romeo for 1932, where he won the Hillclimbing Championship for the third time. In 1933, he established the privateer team Scuderia C.C. with his fellow driver Louis Chiron, but a crash in <b>practice</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Monaco Grand Prix left him with multiple fractures of his right thigh, which ruled him out of racing for more than a year. He returned to the newly reformed Mercedes-Benz racing team in 1934, with whom he won three European Championships, in 1935, 1937 and 1938. Like most German racing drivers in the 1930s, Caracciola {{was a member of the}} Nazi paramilitary group National Socialist Motor Corps (NSKK), but never a member of the Nazi Party. He returned to racing after the Second World War, but crashed in qualifying for the 1946 Indianapolis 500. A second comeback in 1952 was halted by another crash, in a sports car race in Switzerland.|$|E

5|$|In 1902, Maryland Agricultural paid $300 for {{its first}} {{professional}} football coach, John Markey. Markey re-instated physical conditioning and incorporated a tackling dummy during <b>practice</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time at the school. He led Maryland to a 3–5–2 record his first season, before improving to 7–4 in his second year. Markey had not planned {{to play on the}} team, but was forced to fill in for a fullback who was intimidated by a death threat from a Georgetown fan. The following year, in the game against Columbian (now The George Washington University), their opponents complained that Markey was a professional. Maryland Agricultural responded with the same accusation against Columbian fullback Granville Church, and the teams came to an agreement to let both play. Markey went on to score the only points of the game in a 6–0 Maryland Agricultural victory.|$|E
5|$|In {{that race}} at Brands Hatch, Pryce took an unfancied Royale RP11 to {{first place in}} the Formula Three support race for the 1972 Formula One Race of Champions against many {{established}} Formula Three drivers such as Roger Williamson, Jochen Mass and James Hunt. So large was Pryce's advantage {{at the end of the}} race, many of the other teams voiced an opinion that Pryce's car had run the race underweight; it turned out that the circuit's weighbridge certificate had expired and everyone's cars had been underweight. Pryce retired from the leading group in the following two rounds at Oulton Park and Zandvoort, and then during <b>practice</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> support race of the 1972 Monaco Grand Prix his car came to a stop at Casino Square after a wire had come loose. He had exited his car to correct the problem when Peter Lamplough lost control of his car and struck the Royale RP11. Pryce was knocked into a shop window and broke a leg.|$|E
5|$|King James rewarded Robert Cecil, whom {{he made a}} Privy Councillor and {{secretary}} of state, with the granting of the title of Earl of Salisbury in 1605 and Lord High Treasurer in 1608, making him {{the most powerful man}} at the royal court. As Cecil rose, Calvert rose with him. Calvert's foreign languages, legal training, and discretion made him an invaluable aide to Robert Cecil who, no lover of Catholics, seems to have accepted Calvert's conformity as beyond question. Working at the centre of court politics, Calvert exploited his influence by selling favours, an accepted <b>practice</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> times. Calvert accumulated a number of small offices, honours, and sinecures. In August 1605, he attended the King at Oxford, and received an honorary master-of-arts degree in an elaborate ceremony at which the Duke of Lennox (Ludovic Stewart), the earls of Oxford and Northumberland, and Cecilius received degrees. Given the prestige of the other graduates, Calvert's was the last awarded, but his presence in such company signalled his growing stature.|$|E
