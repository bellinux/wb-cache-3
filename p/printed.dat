5|$|Day {{continued}} {{to take on}} challenging and difficult projects. He had already <b>printed</b> the first English book of church music in 1560. In 1567, Matthew Parker, the Archbishop of Canterbury, commissioned Day to print a collection of writings attributed to the tenth-century Aelfric of Eynsham. For this work, Day, known for his fine and varied fonts, had the first-ever font of Anglo-Saxon type cut. The cost was borne by Parker, perhaps Day's most important patron. The font may have been designed by François Guyot, a French type-founder known to have worked for Day and lived in his household. Day used the same font to print Lambarde's Archaionomia (a collection of Anglo-Saxon laws) in 1568. In 1570, he <b>printed</b> Billingsley and Dee's English Euclid, which included folding and movable diagrams—one of the first <b>printed</b> books ever to do so. In the same year, he <b>printed</b> Ascham's Scholemaster.|$|E
