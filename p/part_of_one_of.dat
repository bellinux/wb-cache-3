5|$|Alignment {{with the}} Indonesian government, however, did not {{guarantee}} safety for the Torajans. In 1965, a presidential decree required every Indonesian citizen {{to belong to}} one of five officially recognised religions: Islam, Christianity (Protestantism and Catholicism), Hinduism, or Buddhism. The Torajan religious belief (aluk) was not legally recognised, and the Torajans raised their voices against the law. To make aluk accord with the law, {{it had to be}} accepted as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the official religions. In 1969, Aluk To Dolo ("the way of ancestors") was legalised as a sect of Agama Hindu Dharma, the official name of Hinduism in Indonesia.|$|E

5|$|Jackson {{also stated}} during the 1993 {{interview}} that he first began taking painkiller medications regularly in 1984.

5|$|Also {{contained}} in Hemming's {{work is a}} description of the lawsuit between the diocese of Worcester and Evesham Abbey, which took place between 1078 and 1085. Although only Hemming relates the course of the proceedings, the Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham, or Evesham Chronicle, also gives background information on the dispute. The litigation involved lands that the abbey held in Hampton and Bengeworth in Worcestershire, but that the diocese maintained were actually <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the bishopric's manors. Ownership became disputed under the abbacy of Æthelwig, when the abbot managed to acquire the allegiance of a number of the new owners of lands previously held from the diocese. After Æthelwig's death, most of these lands passed to Odo of Bayeux, but Evesham managed to retain Hampton and Bengeworth, which became the basis of the dispute. The lawsuit was complicated because part of the land had been granted by an earlier bishop, Beorhtheah, to a kinsman, Azur. After the Conquest, Azur's lands were given to Urse d'Abetot, the Sheriff of Worcester. Following Æthelwig's death, Wulfstan was able to secure a settlement with Æthelwig's successor Walter. The settlement, which was concluded in 1086, granted the lands to the abbey, but the diocese was the overlord of the lands, for which the abbey owed military service.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians and {{reptiles}} {{were strongly}} {{affected by the}} Carboniferous rainforest collapse (CRC), an extinction event that occurred ~307 million years ago. The Carboniferous period has long been associated with thick, steamy swamps and humid rainforests. Since plants form the base of almost all of Earth's ecosystems, any changes in plant distribution have always affected animal life to some degree. The sudden collapse of the vital rainforest ecosystem profoundly affected the diversity and abundance of the major tetrapod groups that relied on it. The CRC, which was a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the top two most devastating plant extinctions in Earth's history, was a self-reinforcing and very rapid change of environment wherein the worldwide climate became much drier and cooler overall (although much new work {{is being done to}} better understand the fine-grained historical climate changes in the Carboniferous-Permian transition and how they arose).|$|E

5|$|Business tycoon Louis Benjamin was {{involved}} with Lew Grade as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the four major record companies in the UK at the time. The company was Pye Records which, along with EMI, Philips, and Decca Records (UK), accounted {{for the vast majority}} of music records sold in the UK. In 1959, ATV acquired 50% of Pye Records. Between them, Grade and Benjamin held most of the shares. ATV Music Publishing was created to exploit the catalogue of songs written by artists on the Pye Record label, and for the themes to ITC and ATV television programmes. The UK rights to some of the rock 'n' roll music from the US were also bought by ATV. Grade established ATV's headquarters alongside those of Pye Records; off Edgware Road, beside the Marble Arch in central London.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature {{established}} a statewide legislative route system that initially consisted of 37 unsigned routes. Much {{of what is}} now NY31 west of Jordan became <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> three routes, namely Route14, Route20, and Route30. Route30 began at the Niagara Falls city line (delimited by modern NY61) and followed current NY31 east to Sanborn, where it turned north onto modern NY429. The route followed current NY429 to Ridge Road in Porter, at which point it turned to follow Ridge Road eastward to what is now NY63 in Ridgeway. Route30 went south here, utilizing modern NY63 between Ridgeway and Medina. It rejoined what is now NY31 in the latter location and proceeded eastward on roughly current NY31 to the Rochester city line. In the vicinity of Brockport, however, Route30 was routed on West Avenue and modern NY19 instead. From the southeastern city line to NY96 in the village of Pittsford, Monroe Avenue (modern NY31) was part of Route14, which turned south onto South Main Street in the center of Pittsford. Lastly, the segment what is now NY31 between current NY31F and NY350 in the village of Macedon and NY317 in Jordan was part of Route20.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to her law firm work, Sotomayor found visible public service roles. She was not connected to the party bosses that typically picked people for such jobs in New York, and indeed she was registered as an independent. Instead, District Attorney Morgenthau, an influential figure, served as her patron. In 1987, Governor of New York Mario Cuomo appointed Sotomayor {{to the board of}} the State of New York Mortgage Agency, which she served on until 1992. As <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the largest urban rebuilding efforts in American history, the agency helped low-income people get home mortgages and to provide insurance coverage for housing and AIDS hospices. Despite being the youngest member of a board composed of strong personalities, she involved herself in the details of the operation and was effective. She was vocal in supporting the right to affordable housing, directing more funds to lower-income home owners, and in her skepticism about the effects of gentrification, although in the end she voted in favor of most of the projects.|$|E

50|$|Brecon's town {{walls were}} {{constructed}} by Humphrey de Bohun after 1240. The walls were built of cobble, with four gatehouses and {{was protected by}} ten semi-circular bastions. In 1400 the Welsh prince Owain Glyndŵr rose in rebellion against English rule, and in response in 1404 100 marks was spent by the royal government improving the fortifications to protect Brecon {{in the event of}} a Welsh attack. Brecon's walls were largely destroyed during the English Civil War. Today only fragments survive, including some earthworks and <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the gatehouses; these are protected as scheduled monuments.|$|R
5|$|RAF Duxford, a Royal Air Force fighter station {{had been}} {{declared}} surplus to requirements by the Ministry of Defence in 1969, {{and the museum}} duly requested permission to use <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the airfield's hangars as temporary storage. Duxford featured three double bay hangars of First World War vintage, which together provided over 9000m2 of space. Within two years, ten of the museum's aircraft {{had been brought to}} Duxford, and were being restored by volunteers of the East Anglia Aviation Society. While the museum's own aircraft were not restored to flying condition, by cooperating with private groups the museum was able to mount its first airshow in 1973. Further air shows followed, with a display in June 1976 attracting an audience of 45,000 people. The runway was bought by Cambridgeshire County Council in 1977. The success of these shows provided a valuable source of revenue, and complemented the efforts of volunteers, so that the museum applied for the permanent transfer of the entire site to its use. Permission was received in February 1976 and Duxford became the first outstation of the Imperial War Museum. Initially open from March–October, Duxford received 167,000 visitors in the 1977 season, and 340,000 in 1978. Two million visitors had been received by 1982 and Duxford welcomed its ten millionth visitor in August 2005.|$|E
