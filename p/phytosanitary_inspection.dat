40|$|Abstract Live organisms intercepted from treated com-modities during <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>inspections</b> usually arouse {{suspicions of}} {{treatment}} failure, sub-standard treatment application, or post-treatment infestation. The additional {{possibility that some}} treatments could kill slowly, meaning commodities might be inspected before pests have suc-cumbed, is seldom considered for treatments other than irradiation. We used a novel biochemical viability assay to measure delays between methyl bromide fumigation and mortality of dipteran eggs, and evaluated the correspondence between egg viability and egg morphological features. Our experimental conditions simulated shipping of rock melons from Australia to New Zealand by sea and air. No eggs survived fumigation, but they took 3 – 20 days to die, whereas <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>inspections</b> of rock melons occur within 2 – 7 days. Delays were not influenced by methyl bromide concentration, but were significantly lengthened by cooler storage temperatures. Methyl bromide’s preservative effects delayed degradation of egg morphology, so the biochemical assay detected mortality long before morphological signs of egg death appeared. The results show that commodities subjected to effective methyl bromide treatments {{are at risk of}} being inspected before all pests have either died, or started to exhibit morphological signs of death. This could cause commodities to be unnecessarily rejected by quarantine authorities. Better methods than inspection for live pests are needed to assist authorities to gain assurance that treated commodities have been effectively disinfested. These could be developed by exploiting biochemical responses of pests and commodities to treatments...|$|R

Pathogens may also introduce new genetic diversity or mating types, which could be as devastating as the introduction of a new pathogen.

40|$|Growth and {{liberalization}} {{of world trade}} have increased the risks of introduction of quarantine plant pests into importing countries. Import inspection of incoming commodities is a major tool for prevention of pest introductions related to world trade, but inspection capacities are limited. This article develops a theoretical and an empirical model for the optimal allocation of inspection effort for <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>inspection</b> of imported commodities when the inspecting agency has a limited capacity. It is shown that the optimal allocation of inspection effort equalizes marginal costs of pest introduction across risky commodity pathways. The numerical illustration finds the optimal allocation of inspection effort of chrysanthemum cuttings imported in the Netherlands. The numerical results suggest that "ceteris paribus", greater inspection effort should be allocated to pathways whose inspection yields a greater reduction in the expected costs of pest introduction. The numerical results also suggest that import inspection has a high marginal benefit. In particular, we found that each additional euro of the inspection capacity decreases the expected costs of pest introduction from 18 to 49 euros, depending on the initial inspection capacity.

40|$|Recent disease {{outbreaks}} caused by alien invasive pathogens into European forests posed {{a serious threat}} to forest sustainability with relevant environmental and economic effects. Many of the alien tree pathogens recently introduced into Europe were not previously included on any quarantine lists, thus they were not subject to <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>inspections.</b> The identification and description of alien fungi potentially pathogenic to native European flora before their introduction in Europe, is a paramount need in order to limit the risk of invasion and the impact to forest ecosystems. To determine the potential invasive fungi, a sentinel trees plot was established in Fuyang, China, using healthy seedlings of European tree species including Quercus petreae, Q. suber, and Q. ilex. The fungal assemblage associated with symptomatic specimens was studied using the tag-encoded 454 pyrosequencing of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer- 1 (ITS 1).

40|$|Following {{a request}} from the EU Commission, the EFSA PLH Panel {{conducted}} a scientific opinion on risk analysis and supporting documents provided by APHIS/USDA {{in support of the}} request to remove the Union's plant health import requirement that citrus fruit imported into the EU be sourced from groves where, {{since the beginning of the}} last cycle of vegetation no symptoms of citrus canker were observed, neither in their vicinities. The PHL Panel concluded that the transmission of Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (Xcc) on asymptomatic citrus fruit was more likely when the fruit were collected from infested than from non-infested areas and groves. Symptomatic fruit carries more Xcc cells than asymptomatic fruit and the packinghouse disinfectant treatments do not achieve the eradication of Xcc. The application of management option 2 (i. e. „allow distribution of all types and varieties of commercially packed citrus fruit to all US States, subject to packinghouse treatment with APHIS-approved disinfectant. No packinghouse <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>inspection</b> is required‟) selected by USDA will result in an increase in the Xcc load of citrus fruit consignments and in a subsequent increase in the probability of spread of citrus canker through the fruit pathway. Some data provided in the APHIS-USDA documents support that citrus fruit remain a conceptually possible pathway for transmitting and establishing citrus canker disease. The PLH Panel agrees that transmission of Xcc from infected fruit to a susceptible host is rare. But the withdrawal of the current EU requirement that citrus fruit imported into the EU be sourced from groves where no symptoms of citrus canker have been observed in the field of production and in its immediate vicinity since the beginning of the last cycle of vegetation, will increase the probability of introduction of Xcc into new areas...|$|E

Prediction of the likelihood of pest infestation in imported shipments could help maximize the efficiency of inspection by targeting inspection on shipments with the highest likelihood of infestation. This paper applies a multinomial logistic (MNL) regression model to data on import inspections of ornamental plant commodities in the Netherlands from 1998 to 2001 to investigate whether {{it is possible to}} predict the probability that a shipment will be (i) accepted for import, (ii) rejected for import because of detected pests, or (iii) rejected due to other reasons. Four models were estimated: (i) an all-species model, including all plant imports (136, 251 shipments) in the data set, (ii) a four-species model, including records on the four ornamental commodities that accounted for 28. 9 % of inspected and 49. 5 % of rejected shipments, and two models for single commodities with large import volumes and percentages of rejections, (iii) Dianthus (16. 9 % of inspected and 46. 3 % of rejected shipments), and (iv) Chrysanthemum (6. 9 and 8. 6 %, respectively). All models were highly significant (P < 0. 001). The models for Dianthus and Chrysanthemum and for the set of four ornamental commodities showed a better fit to data than the model for all ornamental commodities. Variables that characterized the imported shipment's region of origin, the shipment's size, the company that imported the shipment, and season and year of import, were significant in most of the estimated models. The combined {{results of this study suggest}} that the MNL model can be a useful tool for modeling the probability of rejecting imported commodities even with a small set of explanatory variables.

The susceptible varieties cause losses ranging from 40 to 100% when infected prior to the five-leaf stage. The losses are 15-35% and 3-15% for seven-leaf and nine-leaf stages, respectively. Stewart's wilt may add additional costs for phytosanitary regulations from trading partners. Such regulations primarily affect seed commerce by preventing seed from being exported or by creating additional costs for <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>inspections</b> prior to export. During epidemics in the 1990s, Stewart's wilt was a significant economic issue for the corn seed industry because of the logistics of trading and exchange of large volumes of field corn seed throughout the world. Stewart's wilt also creates indirect costs for seed producers because resources must be used to screen germplasm and breed corn for Stewart's wilt resistance to develop hybrids that efficiently and effectively control the disease. In Kentucky, the disease causes huge losses for corn producers. Stewart's wilt impacts include stand reductions, production of fewer and smaller ears, and an increased susceptibility of wilt-infected plants to stalk rotting organisms.|$|R
40|$|In 2010, a hot {{debate on}} bean seed {{quality in the}} {{framework}} of a European Research project led a French-speaking association of artisan seed companies to challenge EU "quarantine" measures on the bacterial agents of Common Bacterial Blight (CBB), a seedborne disease of common bean. The artisan seed companies (artisans semenciers) forming the association Croqueurs de Carottes are small enterprises producing and marketing seed of open-pollinated vegetable varieties from the public domain, based on networks of organic seed growing farmers. In doing so, the artisan seed companies contribute to the dynamic conservation of crop diversity and to making this diversity accessible to home and market gardeners. For the Croqueurs as member of the French Réseau Semences Paysannes (peasant seed network), this commercial activity also forms part of a wider movement of seed re-appropriation. The research presented here departs from the hypothesis that the dispute on the CBB "quarantine" measures reveals a more general discrepancy: The rationale behind the plant health management practices of the seed artisans differs from the rationale behind the quarantine measures which they face in the form of <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>inspections.</b> In the aim of specifying the plant health management practices of the artisan seed companies, these practices and the rationale behind it will be unfolded as an actor-network. In terms of actor network theory (ANT), the contestation of quarantine measures on common bean by the Croqueurs in France reveals the actor-network behind their bean health management. Disturbed by the quarantine measures, the network becomes apparent in a process of reassemblage. The network behind this particular plant health management will be unfolded by taking controversial elements of the implementation of quarantine measures as a starting point, such as the official protocol for the detection of bacterial pathogens on seeds and the competences of inspectors in charge of <b>phytosanitary</b> seed <b>inspections.</b> The description of the plant health management by artisanal seed companies will be based on the practices of the Croqueurs in France and Belgium, but also on the practices of two artisanal seed companies in Germany. By contrast, discrepancies with the dominant plant health management rationale will appear. Whereas the "quarantine" measures aim at eradicating CBB in the EU by admitting only CBB-free bean seed on the seed market, the artisan seed companies rather seek to live with plant diseases and integrate plant pathogens in their production systems. For the latter, managing crop and seed health also goes through managing sound environments. In the framework of evolving EU plant regulations and a reorganisation of <b>phytosanitary</b> seed <b>inspections</b> in France, the debates on plant health management in artisanal seed companies persist. Although much has been written and publically debated by non-profit organizations, small-scale seed companies and researchers concerning EU seed legislations, but the role of phytosanitary regulations in the dynamic conservation of crop biodiversity has received little attention. The research presented here represents a first step in addressing this question in the scientific arena. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{international}} trade in plants for planting (P 4 Ps) is a major pathway for the introduction of plant pests. The global trade in P 4 Ps is both voluminous and highly diverse, {{but there is little}} detailed knowledge about its diversity and dynamics. This makes it difficult to assess the risks associated with this trade and to prioritise high-risk commodities (genus-origin combinations) for detailed inspection or regulation. Using the ISEFOR database, this paper describes the diversity and dynamics of P 4 P imports into the EU, based on genus-level data for lots imported into fourteen Member States that provided this data for different periods between 2005 and 2014, totalling over 30 Bn plants and over 7500 commodities. There was great variety, as well as complementarity, in terms of the imported genera, origins and commodities among the countries. Two-thirds of the imported commodities changed every year. Based on the 10 -year data from the Netherlands, the greatest importer of live plants in the dataset, we developed a risk categorisation approach for prioritising the highest risk commodities, based on risk associated information concerning the imported genus and the history of trade with respect to the exporting countries, genera and type of plant material traded. Application of this risk categorisation led to the identification of a modest number of commodities that represent elevated risk, to which more inspection resources can be allocated while lower-risk commodities could be subject to less-intensive <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>inspections.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|Strict {{quarantine}} {{measures for}} {{the export of}} South African citrus fruit to European and US markets require the development of sensitive and accurate detection methods for the pathogen Phyllosticta citricarpa – a fungus causing citrus black spot disease. Because {{of the presence of}} other, non-pathogenic Phyllosticta species, rapid and accurate verification of the Phyllosticta species present on exported citrus fruit is important to producers, exporters and regulatory authorities to prevent unnecessary losses. We have analysed over 800 samples collected over 7 years and have compared sample preparation and detection protocols applied in different environments: nurseries, production systems including <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>inspections</b> in orchards, pack houses and export terminals in order to compile protocols for the detection of P. citricarpa. Standard procedures of sample preparation and DNA extraction were adapted to suit diverse inoculum sources. Low pathogen numbers in symptomless green leaves, for example, obliged the use of a wet-dry enrichment technique constituting the stimulation of fungal growth for easier detection. Physical maceration was adapted for sturdy material using liquid nitrogen or bead beating. The use of a two-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with nested primers significantly increased both the sensitivity and the specificity of the PCR performed on soil samples, overcoming problems with relatively impure DNA extracts and low pathogen numbers.

40|$|As of January 1 st 2005, {{a system}} of reduced checks for <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>inspections</b> of certain plants and plant {{products}} imported into the European Union (EU) is in place. Under this system, plants and plant products satisfying special criteria may be inspected with a reduced frequency. These criteria are based on EU-wide data on historical volumes of import and interceptions of harmful organisms in particular products. The objective {{of this paper is}} two-fold. Firstly, the paper analyses whether proportions of interceptions of harmful organisms associated with cut flowers imported into the Netherlands ¿ the largest EU importer of cut flowers ¿ support the application of reduced checks for certain genera and trades (commodity-exporting country combinations) of cut flowers. Secondly, the paper analyses how effective the reduced checks system is in minimizing the expected costs of introduction of harmful organisms in the EU. For that, a theoretically optimal system for allocating inspection effort to commodities is described. Using an illustrative example and stochastic simulations, the expected costs of introduction of harmful organisms under the theoretically optimal system and the current system of reduced checks are compared. Examination of interceptions of harmful organisms supports application of reduced checks for most genera and trades of cut flowers in the Netherlands. The results of stochastic simulations show that reduced checks may not minimize the expected costs of introduction of harmful organisms into the EU. Accounting for possible economic impacts of harmful organisms in determining the frequencies of reduced checks may help optimize the current syste...|$|R
40|$|International {{trade of}} plants and plant {{products}} {{is one of the}} major vectors for the introduction and spread of exotic pests of plants. Some of these pests may affect agricultural production and/or limit access to international export markets. <b>Phytosanitary</b> <b>inspections</b> {{of plants and}} plant products at border ports are an important phytosanitary measure to ensure compliance with importing countries’ requirements. Measures are formulated by undertaking Pest Risk Analysis (PRA). In many developing countries however, the undertaking of PRAs is affected by limited national phytosanitary capacity and resources. This thesis provides insights that may facilitate more effective phytosanitary regulation, particularly the undertaking of PRAs where limited data and expertise are available for this purpose. The Plant Quarantine and Phytosanitary Service (PQPS), the National Plant Protection Organization (NPPO) of Zambia is a case in point. In light of the above, a simplified PRA procedure was developed, one that is internationally acceptable and easily applied day-to-day with the resources available in a developing country like Zambia. The developed procedure focused on Pest Risk Assessment, the second stage of a PRA as guided by international standards. This stage is key to formulating phytosanitary measures. The procedure is entirely qualitative and relates to particular risk elements. The risk elements used in the simplified procedure were identified for inclusion after a detailed review of PRAs conducted by NPPOs of various developed countries, including Australia, New Zealand and the USA as well as one of the Regional Plant Protection Organizations (RPPO), the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO). The review evaluated the different steps of stage two of these PRAs, specifically, entry, establishment, spread and consequences of the pest(s). Selection of risk elements for inclusion in the procedure was based on their consistent usage in the PRAs reviewed. The procedure was developed to be easy to apply and being user-friendly, with straightforward questions requiring a yes or no response. The procedure developed in this study avoids the burden of misinterpretation of levels of risk through ratings or scoring. As such, the procedure has the potential to be applied by the NPPOs of other developing countries, including Zambia’s PQPS. The procedure can provide PQPS with science-based PRAs to support the application of phytosanitary measures on imported plants and plant products. Use of the procedure was then tested, using Zambia’s import of South African maize (Zea mays) seed for sowing in a comparative study. However, having a suitable PRA procedure is one thing but ensuring there is the capacity to apply it routinely is another. Additional effort was therefore made to identify the essential PRA process components necessary for a NPPO to have an internationally acceptable PRA system. Essential components of a PRA system were determined through the aforementioned comprehensive review of publicly available PRAs as well as NPPOs and RPPOs documented procedures. The essential components included: •	Presence of a PRA unit; •	Collaboration with specialists from all relevant plant health fields, whether in the NPPO or outside; •	Access to published sources of PRA relevant information and the availability of up-to-date data sets; •	Objective, if not independent technical peer review of each PRA; and •	Risk communication and consultation with stakeholders, including potential trading partners(s). As the case in point, the phytosanitary capacity of Zambia’s NPPO, the PQPS was examined in relation to its PRA system. Two questionnaires were designed specifically for this purpose. The questionnaires provided the means to survey PQPS staff to obtain information on: •	Phytosanitary activities at border ports; •	International trade patterns; •	The current PRA process; •	The availability of PRA experts; •	PQPS staffing; •	Availability of and access to sources of information relevant to PRAs; and •	Laboratory and inspection facilities. The questionnaires were applied between November 2011 and June 2012 at the PQPS head office in Lusaka and Zambia’s border ports. Border ports were Katima Mulilo, Chirundu, Copperbelt, Mwami, Nakonde, Victoria Falls and the main airport, the Kenneth Kaunda International Airport (KKIA). Survey results showed that Zambia’s phytosanitary capacity is challenged in relation to PRA processes. The Zambian NPPO does not have staff specifically tasked with conducting PRAs and a PRA unit is not established in its structure. At the time of the survey, PQPS had a staff comprising 26 Plant Health Inspectors (PHIs). Presently, PHIs located at the border ports conduct ad hoc analyses of the risks associated with imported plants and plant products at the same time they complete <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>inspections.</b> In summary, there was little doubt that Zambia’s PRA process needs to be improved. The phytosanitary capacity of its NPPO is lacking and ideally will require significant injection of funds in the long term. In the absence of additional funding, however, improvements could still be made to its PRA process. The effectiveness of Zambia’s phytosanitary regulatory system will depend on its capacity to undertake PRAs. It is recommended that the effectiveness of Zambia’s system could be improved by: (i) restructuring PQPS so as to utilise some of its in-house tertiary qualified personnel located centrally in Head Office to focus on PRAs; (ii) applying routinely the newly developed PRA procedure at Head Office to develop scientifically justified measures to imports of plants and plant products; (iii) utilising the expertise of other centrally located plant health specialists in the PRA process; (iv) clarifying the inspection roles of PQPS border staff; and (v) establishing clearer communication channels with PHIs located at the border ports thereby enabling them to respond consistently to Head Office directives relating to phytosanitary measures required for imported plants and plant products...|$|R

40|$|<b>Phytosanitary</b> import <b>inspections</b> are {{important}} to avoid entry of harmful pests on live plants. In the European Union (EU), all consignments of live plants must be inspected at the first point of entry, and plants allowed entry can be moved without further inspection among the 28 Member States and Switzerland. It is important that inspections in EU countries adhere to the same standard to avoid {{introduction of harmful organisms}} through countries with weaker methods. We tested whether sampling intensity and confidence in the inspection results were the same across these countries. Questionnaires were sent to inspectors in all countries, asking about inspections of individual consignments of woody plants for planting. Data about 102 lots, inspected at 13 points of entry in six countries, were analyzed. We used hypergeometric and binomial statistics for small and large consignments, respectively, to calculate the probability that < 1 % of the plants were infested. The duration of the inspection increased with lot size, but the probability that the infestation level was below 1 % of the plants was lower for small than for large lots. Moreover, large international differences in inspection intensity and the probability that the inspections could detect a level of infestation below 1 % were found: the probability was consistently above 0. 95 in one country, while the average probability was below 0. 6 in the other countries. We suggest that the EU Member States adopt common maximum acceptable infestation levels and harmonized, statistics-based sampling protocols for plants for planting.
