25|$|The {{development}} of smokeless powders, such as cordite, {{in the late}} 19th century created {{the need for a}} spark-sensitive <b>priming</b> <b>charge,</b> such as gunpowder. However, the sulfur content of traditional gunpowders caused corrosion problems with Cordite Mk I and this led to the introduction of a range of sulfur-free gunpowders, of varying grain sizes. They typically contain 70.5 parts of saltpeter and 29.5 parts of charcoal. Like black powder, they were produced in different grain sizes. In the United Kingdom, the finest grain was known as sulfur-free mealed powder (SMP). Coarser grains were numbered as sulfur-free gunpowder (SFG n): 'SFG 12', 'SFG 20', 'SFG 40' and 'SFG 90', for example; where the number represents the smallest BSS sieve mesh size, which retained no grains.|$|E

50|$|The {{projectiles}} and wads {{were then}} pushed {{down into the}} breech with a ramrod until they were firmly seated on the propellant charge. Priming powder was usually carried in a separate priming flask and poured into the priming pan and the lock was pushed down to hold the priming powder in place. After the gunpowder and projectile or shot charge {{were placed in the}} barrel a ramrod was used to firmly pack everything down {{at the base of the}} barrel. Then either a <b>priming</b> <b>charge</b> was placed in the priming pan, or a percussion cap was placed on the nipple, the firing mechanism initiated; in a flintlock the hammer was then cocked to make the firearm ready to fire.|$|E

50|$|Starting {{in about}} 1877, paper hulls started to replace brass shotgun shells. Paper hulls {{remained}} popular {{for nearly a}} century, until the late 1960s. These shotgun shells using paper hulls were nearly always roll crimped, although fold crimping also eventually became popular. The primers on these paper hull shotgun shells also changed from the pistol primers used on the early brass shotgun shells to a primer containing both the <b>priming</b> <b>charge</b> and an anvil, unlike rifle and pistol ammunition, making the shotgun shell primer taller. Card wads, made of felt and cork, as well as paperboard, were all used at various times, gradually giving way to plastic over powder wads, with card wads, and, eventually, to all plastic wads. Starting in the 1960s, plastic cases started to replace paper hulls for shotgun shells. By the 1980s, plastic cases had largely replaced nearly all paper hulls for shotgun shells.|$|E

5000|$|The frizzen, {{historically}} {{called the}} steel, is an [...] "L" [...] shaped piece of steel hinged {{at the rear}} used in flintlock firearms. It is positioned over the flash pan so as to enclose a small <b>priming</b> <b>charge</b> of black powder next to the flash hole that is drilled through the barrel into where the main charge is loaded. When the trigger is pulled, the hammer or cock—which includes a shaped piece of flint held into a set of jaws by a scrap of leather or thin piece of lead—snaps forward causing the flint to scrape down {{the face of the}} frizzen (historically called the 'battery'), throwing it back to expose the black powder in the pan. The flint scraping the steel causes a shower of sparks to be thrown into the pan, igniting the black powder and sending flames through the touch hole, which in turn ignites the main charge of black powder in the breech of the barrel, shooting the projectile out the barrel.|$|E

40|$|Simultaneous {{measurements}} of low energy precipitating electrons and magnetic fluctuations {{from the low}} altitude polar orbiting satellite OGO- 4 have been compared. Analysis of {{the two sets of}} experimental data for isolated events led to the classification of high latitude field-aligned currents as purely temporal or purely spatial variations. Magnetic field disturbances calculated using these simple current models and the measured particle fluxes were in good agreement with measured field values. While fluxes of greater than 1 keV electrons are detected primarily on the nightside, magnetometer disturbances indicative of field-aligned currents were seen at all local times, both in the visual auroral regions and dayside polar cusp. Thus electrons with energies less than approximately 1 keV are the <b>prime</b> <b>charge</b> carriers in high latitude dayside field-aligned currents. The satellite measurements are in good agreement with previously measured field-aligned current values and with values predicted from several models involving magnetospheric field-aligned currents...|$|R
