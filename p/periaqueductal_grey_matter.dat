40|$|Cyclical {{changes in}} {{production}} of neuroactive steroids during the oestrous cycle induce {{significant changes in}} GABAA receptor expression in female rats. In the <b>periaqueductal</b> <b>grey</b> (PAG) <b>matter,</b> upregulation of ÃŽÂ± 4 ÃŽÂ² 1 ÃŽÂ´ GABAA receptors occurs as progesterone levels fall during late dioestrus (LD) or during withdrawal from an exogenous progesterone dosing regime.

Electrophysiological studies showed that when ÃŽÂ± 4 ÃŽÂ² 1 ÃŽÂ´ GABAA receptor expression was increased, the excitability of the output neurones in the PAG increased, due to a decrease in the level of ongoing inhibitory tone from the GABAergic interneurones. The functional consequences in terms of nociceptive processing were investigated in conscious rats. Baseline tail flick latencies were similar in all rats.

40|$|Background: In <b>periaqueductal</b> <b>grey</b> (PAG) <b>matter,</b> {{cross-talk}} {{between the}} Mu-opioid receptor (MOR) and the glutamate N-methyl-D-Aspartate receptor (NMDAR) -CaMKII pathway supports {{the development of}} analgesic tolerance to morphine. In neurons, histidine triad nucleotide binding protein 1 (HINT 1) connects the regulators of G protein signaling RGSZ 1 and RGSZ 2 to the C terminus of the MOR. In response to morphine, this HINT 1 -RGSZ complex binds PKCc, and afterwards, the interplay between PKCc, Src and Gz/Gi proteins leads to sustained potentiation of NMDAR-mediated glutamate responses. Methodology/Principal Findings: Following an intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of 10 nmol morphine, Akt was recruited to the synaptosomal membrane and activated by Thr 308 and Ser 473 phosphorylation. The Akt activation was immediately transferred to neural Nitric Oxide Synthase (nNOS) Ser 1417. Afterwards, nitric oxide (NO) -released zinc ions recruited PKCc to the MOR to promote the Src-mediated phosphorylation of the Tyr 1325 NMDAR 2 A subunit. This action increased NMDAR calcium flux and CaMKII was activated in a calcium-calmodulin dependent manner. CaMKII then acted on nNOS Ser 847 to produce a sustained reduction in NO levels. The activation of the Akt-nNOS pathway was also reduced by the binding of these proteins to the MOR-HINT 1 complex where they remained inactive. Tolerance to acute morphine developed {{as a result of}} phosphorylation of MOR cytosolic residues, uncoupling from the regulated G proteins which are transferred to RGSZ 2 proteins. The diminished effect of morphine was prevented by LNNA, an inhibitor of nNOS function...|$|R

For the treatment of chronic pain refractory to medical therapies, several prospective case series have been reported, but few centres worldwide have published findings from patients treated during the last decade using current standards of technology. This thesis seeks to survey the current clinical status of DBS for pain, investigate its mechanisms and their interactions with autonomic function, its clinical limitations and ablative alternatives. Presented first is a review of the current status of analgesic DBS including contemporary clinical studies. The historical background, scientific rationale, patient selection and assessment methods, surgical techniques and results are described. The clinical outcomes of DBS of the sensory thalamus and periventricular / <b>periaqueductal</b> <b>grey</b> (PAVG) <b>matter</b> in two centres are presented including results from several pain and quality of life measures. A series of translational investigations in human subjects receiving DBS for pain elucidating mechanisms of analgesic DBS and its effects upon autonomic function are then presented. Single photon emission tomography comparing PAVG, VP thalamus and dual target stimulation is described. Somatosensory and local field potential (LFP) recordings suggesting PAVG somatotopy are shown. ABPM results demonstrating changes with PAVG DBS are given and Portapres studies into heart rate variability changes with ventral PAVG DBS are detailed. Investigations using naloxone are then shown to hypothesise separate dorsal opioidergic and ventral parasympathetic analgesic streams in the PAVG. Finally, cingulotomy in lung cancer to relieve pain and dyspnoea results are discussed in the context of altering pain and autonomic function by functional neurosurgery. Pain and autonomic interactions and mechanisms in deep brain surgery for pain are then discussed alongside its limitations with proposals made for optimising treatment and improving outcomes.

50|$|Von Economo, in his studies, {{noticed that}} lesions in the {{connection}} between the midbrain and the diencephalon caused prolonged sleepiness and therefore proposed the idea of an ascending arousal system. During the past few decades major ascending pathways have been discovered with located neurons and respective neurotransmitters. This pathway divides into two branches: one that ascends to the thalamus and activates the thalamus relay neurons, and another one that activates neurons in the lateral part of the hypothalamus and the basal forebrain, and throughout the cerebral cortex. The cell group involved in the first pathway is an acetylcholine-producing cell group called pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nucleus(PPT/LDT). These neurons {{play a crucial role in}} bridging information in between the thalamus and the cerebral cortex. These neurons have high activation during wakefulness and during REM sleep and a low activation during NREM sleep. The second branch originates from monoaminorgenic neurons. These neurons are located in the locus coeruleus, dorsal and median raphe nuclei, ventral <b>periaqueductal</b> <b>grey</b> <b>matter,</b> and tuberomammillary nucleus. Each group produces a different neurotransmitter. The neurons in the locus coeruleus produce noradrenaline, as fore the neurons in the dorsal and median raphe nuclei, ventral <b>periaqueductal</b> <b>grey</b> <b>matter,</b> and tuberomammillary nucleus produce serotonin, dopamine and histamine respectively. They then project onto the hypothalamic peptidergic neurons, which contain melanin-concentrated hormones or orexin, and basal forebrain neurons which contain GABA and acetylcholine. These neurons then project onto the cerebral cortex. It has also been discovered that lesions to this part of the brain cause prolonged sleep or may produce coma.|$|E
50|$|The {{midbrain}} is {{also known}} as the Mesencephalon {{and is one of the}} three major brain divisions. The midbrain is broken up into the tectum and the tegmentum. There are some important structures located within the tegmentum. The midbrain tegmentum is the part of the midbrain extending from the substantia nigra to the cerebral aqueduct in a horizontal section of the midbrain. It forms the floor of the midbrain that surrounds the cerebral aqueduct. Additional structures include the reticular formation, red nucleus, ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the <b>periaqueductal</b> <b>grey</b> <b>matter.</b> The midbrain tegmentum contains thousands of neurons that are responsible for a variety of many functions, two of which include the control of movement and sensory systems.|$|E
25|$|This {{effect of}} {{descending}} inhibition {{can be shown}} by electrically stimulating the <b>periaqueductal</b> <b>grey</b> area of the midbrain. The <b>periaqueductal</b> <b>grey</b> in turn projects to other areas involved in pain regulation, such as the nucleus raphes magnus which also receives similar afferents from the nucleus reticularis paragigantocellularis (NPG). In turn the nucleus raphe magnus projects to the substantia gelatinosa region of the dorsal horn and mediates the sensation of spinothalamic inputs. The <b>periaqueductal</b> <b>grey</b> also contains opioid receptors which explains one of the mechanisms by which opioids such as morphine and diacetylmorphine exhibit an analgesic effect.|$|R

However, {{little is known}} about the control of A- vs. C-fibre inputs to lamina I and the lateral spinal nucleus, and how this correlates with the control of deeper laminae. To address this, the laminar distributions of neurones expressing Fos-like immunoreactivity were determined following preferential activation of A- or C-heat nociceptors, using fast or slow rates of skin heating, respectively, in the absence or presence of descending control evoked from the <b>periaqueductal</b> <b>grey.</b> In lamina I, numbers of Fos-positive neurones following both fast and slow rates of skin heating were reduced significantly following activation in the ventrolateral and dorsolateral/lateral <b>periaqueductal</b> <b>grey.</b> In contrast, in the deep dorsal horn (laminae III–VI), activation in both the ventrolateral and dorsolateral/lateral <b>periaqueductal</b> <b>grey</b> significantly reduced the numbers of Fos-positive neurones evoked by C- but not A-nociceptor stimulation. C- but not A-heat nociceptor activation evoked Fos bilaterally in the lateral spinal nucleus. Stimulation in the ventrolateral but not the dorsolateral/lateral <b>periaqueductal</b> <b>grey</b> significantly increased the numbers of Fos-positive neurones evoked by A- and C-nociceptor stimulation bilaterally in the lateral spinal nucleus. These data have demonstrated differences in the descending control of the superficial vs. the deep dorsal horn and lateral spinal nucleus with respect to the processing of A- and C-fibre-evoked events.

40|$|Acute stress {{suppresses}} pain by activating brain pathways {{that engage}} opioid or non-opioid mechanisms. Here {{we show that}} an opioid-independent form of this phenomenon, termed stress-induced analgesia, is mediated by the release of endogenous marijuana-like (cannabinoid) compounds in the brain. Blockade of cannabinoid CB 1 receptors in the <b>periaqueductal</b> <b>grey</b> <b>matter</b> of the midbrain prevents non-opioid stress-induced analgesia. In this region, stress elicits the rapid formation of two endogenous cannabinoids, the lipids 2 -arachidonoylglycerol (2 -AG) and anandamide. A newly developed inhibitor of the 2 -AG-deactivating enzyme, monoacylglycerol lipase, selectively increases 2 -AG concentrations and, when injected into the <b>periaqueductal</b> <b>grey</b> <b>matter,</b> enhances stress-induced analgesia in a CB 1 -dependent manner. Inhibitors of the anandamide-deactivating enzyme fatty-acid amide hydrolase, which selectively elevate anandamide concentrations, exert similar effects. Our {{results indicate that the}} coordinated release of 2 -AG and anandamide in the <b>periaqueductal</b> <b>grey</b> <b>matter</b> might mediate opioid-independent stress-induced analgesia.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Somatosensory homunculi {{have been}} {{demonstrated}} in primary somatosensory cortex and ventral posterior thalamus but not <b>periaqueductal</b> and periventricular <b>grey</b> <b>matter</b> (PAVG), a therapeutic target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) in chronic pain. AIMS: The study is an investigation of somatotopic representation in PAVG and assessment for a somatosensory homunculus. METHODS: Five human subjects were investigated using electrical somatosensory stimulation and deep brain macroelectrode recording. DBS were implanted in the contralateral PAVG. Cutaneous arm, leg and face regions were stimulated while event-related potentials were recorded from deep brain electrodes. Electrode contact positions were mapped using MRI and brain atlas information. RESULTS: Monopolar P 1 somatosensory evoked potential amplitudes were highest and onset latencies shortest in contralateral caudal PAVG with facial stimulation and rostral with leg stimulation, in agreement with reported subjective sensation during intra-operative electrode advancement. CONCLUSIONS: A rostrocaudally inverted somatosensory homunculus exists in the human PAVG region. Objective human evidence of PAVG somatotopy increases understanding of a brainstem region important to pain and autonomic control that is a clinical target for both pharmacological and neurosurgical therapies. Such knowledge may assist DBS target localisation for neuropathic pain syndromes related to particular body regions like brachial plexopathies, anaesthesia dolorosa and phantom limb pain...|$|R
40|$|Survival in {{threatening}} situations {{depends on}} the selection and rapid execution of an appropriate active or passive defensive response, yet the underlying brain circuitry is not understood. Here we use circuit-based optogenetic, in vivo and in vitro electrophysiological, and neuroanatomical tracing methods to define midbrain <b>periaqueductal</b> <b>grey</b> circuits for specific defensive behaviours.

40|$|The defence {{areas of}} the rat brain stem have been {{extensively}} explored using electrical and chemical stimulation {{in an attempt to}} locate the regions containing the perikarya of neurones which may initiate or integrate the visceral and behavioural components of the defence reaction. In rats anaesthetized with alphaxalone-alphadolone, a cannula electrode was used to compare the responses to electrical stimuli with those evoked by microinjection of the excitatory amino acid D,L-homocysteic acid (DLH), at the same site. A total of 128 sites throughout the brain stem was studied in 75 rats. The pattern of visceral and somatic changes characteristic of the defence reaction, viz. increases in arterial blood pressure and heart rate, vasodilatation in hind-limb muscles and vasoconstriction in the kidney, hyperpnoea and tachypnoea, exophthalmos, mydriasis, twitching of the vibrissae and retroflexion of the tail, was evoked by electrical stimulation within well-defined regions of the brain stem, from the anterior hypothalamus to the pons. Microinjection of DLH into the same regions could evoke the full defence reaction, as defined above, but only from the dorsomedial <b>periaqueductal</b> <b>grey</b> <b>matter.</b> Three other regions were defined from which almost all the autonomic components of the defence reaction were evoked, except that blood pressure fell. These were located: immediately dorsal to the optic chiasma, in the medial tuberal region of the hypothalamus and in the lateral pontine tegmentum.

The sites of involvement include the cerebral cortex, quadrigeminal bodies, red nuclei, dentate and olivary nuclei, and the superior cerebellar peduncles. 4 Ichikawa et al reported a case of methyl bromide intoxication involving bilateral sym-metrical lesions on MRI in the putamen, the subthalamic nuclei, the dorsal medulla oblongata, the inferior colliculi, and the <b>periaqueductal</b> <b>grey</b> <b>matter</b> of the midbrain. 5 Methyl bromide intoxication can be sus-pected on the basis of history of exposure, clinical findings, and results of laboratory studies. There are no reliable indicators of exposure to methyl bromide; due to its short half life, it rapidly becomes undetectable in human tissues, and serum bromide concen-trations are considered to correlate poorly with clinical symptoms and outcome. 3 To our knowledge, lesions confined to the SCC have not previously been reported in patients with methyl bromide poisoning.

Injections of d,l-homocysteic acid (DLH; 0. 5 mm, 0. 3 μl) into a restricted region of the ventral medullary raphé suppressed the tail vasodilatation normally elicited by warming the preoptic area to 42 °C.

40|$|The caudo-cranially {{intermediate}} {{one-third of}} medullary dorsal region, the <b>periaqueductal</b> <b>grey</b> and the rostro-ventral {{portion of the}} midbrain tegmentum of adult chickens were studied in detail {{by means of the}} PAP-DAB procedure, to define further the main morphological features of the neuronal populations that in previous studies had shown VIP (Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide),-Somatostatin (SRIF) -, and Bombesin-like immunoreactivities. In the medulla, VIP-like immunoreactivity was detected within neuronal bodies and processes and extended down to the cervical spinal cord. SRIF-like immunoreactivity was seen only within nerve cell processes, at least a part of which could be sensitive fibre terminals. Bombesin-like immunoreactivity was observed only within neuronal processes. In the <b>periaqueductal</b> <b>grey,</b> all 3 immunoreactivities were detected within perikarya and neuronal processes, with a higher density cranially. In the rostro-ventral portion of the midbrain tegmentum, VIP-like and Bombesin-like immunoreactivities were detected (the latter being located somewhat more cranially) both in neuronal bodies and in processes. SRIF-like immunoreactivity was found in this region only in long neuronal processes...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Deep brain {{stimulation}} (DBS) of subcortical brain {{areas such}} as the <b>periaqueductal</b> <b>grey</b> and subthalamic nucleus has been shown to alter cardiovascular autonomic performance. The supramedullary circuitry controlling respiratory airways is not well defined and has not been tested in humans. OBJECTIVE: To use direct electric stimulation via DBS macroelectrodes to test whether airway resistance could be manipulated by these areas in awake humans. METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with in-dwelling deep brain electrodes for movement disorders or chronic pain underwent spirometry according to the European Respiratory Society guidelines. Testing was performed randomly 3 times on stimulation and 3 times off stimulation; patients were blinded to the test. Thoracic diameter changes were measured by a circumferential pressure-sensitive thoracic band. Ten <b>periaqueductal</b> <b>grey</b> and 10 subthalamic nucleus patients were tested. To control for confounding pain and movement disorder relief, the sensory thalamus in 7 patients and globus pallidus interna in 10 patients, respectively, were also tested. RESULTS: Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) increased significantly with <b>periaqueductal</b> <b>grey</b> and subthalamic nucleus stimulation by up to 14 % (P =. 02 and. 005, respectively, paired-samples Student t tests). Stimulation of control nuclei produced no significant PEFR change. Similarly, changes in thoracic diameter reflecting skeletal activity rather than airway caliber did not correlate with the improvement in PEFR. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second was unchanged by stimulation. CONCLUSION: DBS can improve PEFR in chronic pain and movement disorder patients. This finding provides insights into the neural modulation of respiratory performance and may explain some of the subjective benefits of DBS...|$|R
