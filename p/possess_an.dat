5|$|Cochrane {{argues that}} nonhuman animals do not <b>possess</b> <b>an</b> {{intrinsic}} interest in freedom. Therefore, owning or using nonhuman animals is not, in itself, unjust. This {{aspect of his}} thought has generated responses by others, including the political theorist Robert Garner and the philosopher John Hadley, who argue {{that there may be}} reasons to claim that nonhuman animals do <b>possess</b> <b>an</b> interest in freedom. Cochrane has also proposed a cosmopolitan alternative to Sue Donaldson and Will Kymlicka's picture of a political animal rights, explicated in their 2011 book Zoopolis. Though Donaldson and Kymlicka have defended their account against Cochrane's criticism, they have said that they welcome attempts to develop alternative political theories of animal rights to their own. Cochrane's other research focusses variously on bioethics, punishment, just war and human rights.|$|E

The civilian administration, however, never considered utilizing the big bombers (whose operations remained {{under the control}} of the Strategic Air Command) very far north of the DMZ, believing that it was too overt an escalation. Air Force Chief of Staff John P. McConnell also opposed sending the bombers into the air defense environment in the north and limited B-52 strikes to Route Package One.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, {{access to}} illegal content (such as child pornography) was {{strictly}} self-regulated by individual internet service providers. This began when BT Group introduced Cleanfeed, a server-side filtering system which uses {{data obtained from}} the Internet Watch Foundation. The IWF is a Quango organisation that operates a website where users can report web pages containing illegal or dubious content {{to be added to}} their blacklists. This was implemented in order to prevent users from accessing this material, since it is illegal to <b>possess</b> <b>an</b> indecent image of a child under the age of 18 per the Protection of Children Act. British ISPs were later obligated by the government to implement filters for illegal content by the beginning of 2007.|$|E

5|$|Saadanius had {{a longer}} face than living catarrhines, more closely {{resembling}} New World monkeys in appearance, {{although it was}} larger—possibly {{the size of a}} gibbon. Its enlarged, deep-rooted canine teeth, the diastema (space) between its canine teeth and second incisors, and its sagittal crest (ridge of bone running lengthwise down the top of the skull) suggest that the specimen was a male. These features are shared among male Old World monkeys. Saadanius lacks the advanced frontal sinus found in living catarrhines, but it does <b>possess</b> <b>an</b> ectotympanic, or bony ear tube, found in living catarrhines. Propliopithecoids, the oldest stem group of catarrhines, which date back 35 to 30mya, lacked a fully developed ectotympanic.|$|E
5|$|The Rodrigues {{solitaire}} shared traits {{with the}} dodo, its closest relative, such as size and {{features in the}} skull, pelvis and sternum. It differed in other aspects; it was taller and more slender than the dodo and had a smaller skull and beak, a flatter skull roof and larger orbits. Its neck and legs were proportionally longer, and the dodo did not <b>possess</b> <b>an</b> equivalent to the carpal knob of the Rodrigues solitaire. Many skeletal features of the Rodrigues solitaire and dodo that are unique among pigeons have evolved to adapt to flightlessness. Their pelvic elements were thicker than those of flighted birds (to support their greater weight), and their pectoral region and wings were paedomorphic (underdeveloped, retaining juvenile features). However, the skull, trunk and pelvic limbs were peramorphic, which means they changed considerably with maturity.|$|E

5|$|Advisors {{are large}} larvae-like creatures which are {{virtually}} featureless, with no visible eyes, ears or limbs, {{though they do}} <b>possess</b> <b>an</b> eye-like mechanical device attached {{to the left side}} of their heads, and detachable mechanical arms. Their faces are covered by a form of respirator, which is able to lift to reveal a mouth-like orifice from which extends a long flexible proboscis. With this, they can examine objects, or attack and kill enemies. Advisors appear to be feeding upon their victim during their attacks. It is implied that Advisors are the original master race behind the Combine, with the Earth administrator Wallace Breen answering directly to them. Although Advisors are usually seen in protective pods guarded by Combine soldiers, they also possess telekinetic powers with which they are able to float through the air and immobilize enemies so that their proboscis can examine their victims without interference. Their appearance was based on the Guild Navigators from the film Dune.|$|E
5|$|Gamma delta T cells (γδ T cells) <b>possess</b> <b>an</b> {{alternative}} T-cell receptor (TCR) {{as opposed}} to CD4+ and CD8+ (αβ) T cells and share the characteristics of helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells and NK cells. The conditions that produce responses from γδ T cells are not fully understood. Like other 'unconventional' T cell subsets bearing invariant TCRs, such as CD1d-restricted Natural Killer T cells, γδ T cells straddle the border between innate and adaptive immunity. On one hand, γδ T cells are a component of adaptive immunity as they rearrange TCR genes to produce receptor diversity and can also develop a memory phenotype. On the other hand, the various subsets {{are also part of}} the innate immune system, as restricted TCR or NK receptors may be used as pattern recognition receptors. For example, large numbers of human Vγ9/Vδ2 T cells respond within hours to common molecules produced by microbes, and highly restricted Vδ1+ T cells in epithelia respond to stressed epithelial cells.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{skeletal}} features that distinguish the dodo and the Rodrigues solitaire, its closest relative, from pigeons {{have been attributed}} to their flightlessness. The pelvic elements were thicker than those of flighted pigeons to support the higher weight, and the pectoral region and the small wings were paedomorphic, meaning that they were underdeveloped and retained juvenile features. The skull, trunk and pelvic limbs were peramorphic, meaning that they changed considerably with age. The dodo shared several other traits with the Rodrigues solitaire, such as features of the skull, pelvis, and sternum, as well as their large size. It differed in other aspects, such as being more robust and shorter than the solitaire, having a larger skull and beak, a rounded skull roof, and smaller orbits. The dodo's neck and legs were proportionally shorter, and it did not <b>possess</b> <b>an</b> equivalent to the knob present on the solitaire's wrists.|$|E

5|$|The energy {{provided}} by tidal flexing drives active geological processes within Europa's interior, {{just as they}} do to a far more obvious degree on its sister moon Io. Although Europa, like the Earth, may <b>possess</b> <b>an</b> internal energy source from radioactive decay, the energy generated by tidal flexing would be several orders of magnitude greater than any radiological source. Life on Europa could exist clustered around hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor, or below the ocean floor, where endoliths are known to inhabit on Earth. Alternatively, it could exist clinging to the lower surface of Europa's ice layer, much like algae and bacteria in Earth's polar regions, or float freely in Europa's ocean. If Europa's ocean is too cold, biological processes similar to those known on Earth could not take place. If it is too salty, only extreme halophiles could survive in that environment. In 2010, a model proposed by Richard Greenberg of the University of Arizona proposed that irradiation of ice on Europa's surface could saturate its crust with oxygen and peroxide, which could then be transported via tectonic processes into the interior ocean. Such a process could render Europa's ocean as oxygenated as our own within just 12 million years, allowing for the existence of complex, multicellular lifeforms.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{many other}} states, New Jersey imposes no {{restrictions}} on the types or quantities of alcoholic beverages that a person of legal age may purchase. Grain alcohol, caffeinated alcoholic beverages, and absinthe can be legally sold, and state law imposes no limitations on the alcohol content of beer or wine. New Jersey does not require kegs to be registered, and state ABC regulations prohibit municipal keg registration laws. A resident can import any amount of alcohol into the state for personal use, but a $50 permit is required if more than 3 gallons of beer, 1 gallon of wine, or a half-gallon of spirits are being imported within a 24-hour period. Any person who is 21 years or older may produce up to 200 gallons of beer or wine per year. No permit is required, but any brewing or winemaking must take place at a private home or non-commercial property, and any beer and wine produced cannot be sold. It is a criminal offense to <b>possess</b> <b>an</b> unregistered still, or distill any amount of hard liquor.|$|E
