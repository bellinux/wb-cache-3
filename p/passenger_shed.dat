50|$|Both years, {{alongside}} the live art event of See No Evil with graffiti artists at work, Hear No Evil featured live music and DJ sets show casing Bristol's music scene, plus graffiti workshops, food stalls, breakdancing, face painting, and pop-up galleries.

Both years featured A Hear no Evil block {{party on the}} final Saturday and in 2012 Busking day on Sunday 19 August, organised by Team Love and festival director Mike Bennett.

5000|$|Nottingham Carrington Street {{railway station}} {{was the first}} railway station in Nottingham, opened in 1839 by the Midland Counties Railway. Initially there were two lines with a central {{platform}} as well as side ones according to Billson. [...] Victorian civil engineer Francis Whishaw described the station as:"The elevation next to the road to Nottingham is of plain but neat design. It consists of a central portion and two wings; the central portion contains the entrance hall, which is of the whole height of the building. In the right wing is the booking office for first and second class passengers, with windows (looking to the hall) at which the passengers receive their tickets; the third class passengers obtain their tickets at a counter fixed in the hall. In the left-wing is the boardroom and clerks offices; and in a building projecting towards the <b>passenger</b> <b>shed</b> in the rear is a waiting room for ladies.The train shed {{is covered with a}} light iron roof in two spans, which is supported on the departure side by a brick wall, in which there are eight windows; and on the arrival side, and along the middle line, by two rows of cast iron columns, nine in each row."However, Whishaw in 1840 writes the station had grown to four lines. As was usual in those days there were [...] "as many turntables without the shed; the cross line intersecting which communicates with the carriage wharf or landing, which is on the arrival side". This arrangement would probably be similar to that at Derby, allowing coaches to be manhandled between tracks to form trains.On the north side the station was next to the canal and a small warehouse allowed for transshipment of cargoes between the canal and railway. The original gateposts to the yard and the bridge under the towpath still survive.|$|E
50|$|The Warwick Railway Complex is {{an intact}} {{example of a}} railway precinct dating from the late 19th century.

The site with extant <b>passenger</b> station, goods' <b>shed,</b> footbridge, turntable pit, various residences, camping quarters, railway workers' institute and other communal buildings, sale yards and various other smaller buildings and structures, including the extant sidings is an important document of Queensland railway history.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a speech}} at the Knesset a day after her release, Zoabi called the raid a [...] "pirate {{military}} operation" [...] and asked for an international investigation. She also demanded to know why the Israeli government had not released photos and videos it confiscated from <b>passengers</b> that might <b>shed</b> light on why nine passengers were killed and dozens wounded. During her address she also said, [...] "Israel spoke of a provocation, but there was no provocation. Why does the government of Israel oppose an investigation?" ...|$|R
50|$|After closure, {{a strong}} {{campaign}} was waged {{to allow the}} railway to reopen both as an independent community railway linking with the main line at Wareham and as a steam locomotive operated heritage railway. The Swanage Railway ran its first train in August 1979 from a temporary platform under Northbrook Road bridge up to the council yard. It began operating a steam service at the Swanage {{end of the line}} in 1982. The <b>passenger</b> station, goods <b>shed</b> and locomotive facilities have been restored to their 1937 configuration, although the goods yard is now the site of a supermarket.|$|R
50|$|After {{purchasing}} the L&O's rights-of-way west from Frankfort from the Commonwealth, the Louisville and Frankfort issued stock and raised $800,000 from the City of Louisville. Surveys directed by Col. Stephen H. Long of the U.S. Topographical Engineers selected a new route, employing some {{but not all}} of the stretches previously graded by the Lexington and Ohio. The rails for the road were purchased in London, England, and shipped upriver from New Orleans. Construction began in March 1849, heading east from Louisville. The one-story brick <b>passenger</b> station, train <b>shed,</b> freight shed, and roundhouse were all located at Brook and Jefferson Streets. Near Cherokee Gardens in Louisville, the line ran adjacent to present-day Frankfort Avenue. On February 6, 1850, the company held a special round trip to LaGrange for the board of directors and their guests. All the initial track was laid by the spring of 1851 and the completion of a bridge over the Kentucky River near Frankfort permitted the first service along the entire mainline in August.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in 1873, {{the village}} was served by the Clayton Division of the Rome, Watertown and Ogdensburg Railroad (RW&O), which later {{became a part of}} the New York Central network. At its peak, {{multiple}} express trains per day ran from Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan to bring passengers and freight to Clayton's ferry terminal, which was the gateway to the Thousand Islands region. Facilities included a train yard and locomotive <b>shed.</b> <b>Passenger</b> service ceased in 1951; freight service continued until 1972, after which the tracks were torn out. The station and ferry terminal were converted into Frink Park, a public venue for performances and mooring for visiting ships, while the rail yards were incorporated into the property of the Frink-America snowplow factory, which was demolished in 2010. The property then stood vacant as Village property until it was sold {{for the development of a}} hotel that was finished in 2013. The remainder of the right-of-way within the village is maintained as the Sissy Danforth Rivergate Trail, a multi-use recreational trail maintained by the Thousand Islands Land Trust and the Rivergate Wheelers ATV club.|$|R
50|$|Remnants {{of closed}} {{railways}} often diminish and disappear {{with the passage}} of time, but some relics of the Southbridge Branch remain. Its formation can be traced for much of the line's length, though it does vanish at some points, at least in part because the flat terrain did not require substantial earthworks in the first place. There are also some bridge and culvert remains to be found along the line's former route, such as a footbridge near Lincoln utilising ex-railway abutments. Doyleston contains some of the most significant remnants, with the station site still in possession of its goods shed, loading bank, and <b>passenger</b> platform. Goods <b>sheds</b> can also be found in Leeston and Springston, with the latter utilised as an engineer's workshop. Ellesmere retains concrete foundation remains, and in Irwell, rails can be found scattered at the station site and embedded in a road near an old factory. Some remnants of the line can be seen today in Southbridge, such as the rail and loading dock inside present day Hamilton Seeds.|$|R
500|$|Infrastructure {{works and}} {{construction}} of the power station on the Rue Lemire were swiftly completed. The first electric locomotive entered service on 2 January 1896, the electrified network going live fifteen days ahead of schedule; the last horse-drawn tram saw service on 19 July on the Sotteville line. After teething troubles, the new mode of transport had considerable success: in 1896 it transported over fifteen million <b>passengers.</b> The tram <b>sheds,</b> holding 50 vehicles, were expanded to accommodate 25 more {{during the first year}} of service. These were classic tramcars with two axles, powered by two [...] motors (one on each axle), and had room for 40 passengers. With its popular success, the network could be completed: the Line 10 extension to Saint-Étienne-du-Rouvray was opened on 16 April 1899, an 11th line was constructed from Maromme to Notre-Dame-de-Bondeville (opened 17 December 1899), and a 12th from the Church of Saint-Sever to the Saint-Maur sea wall (6 February 1908). The Rouen tramways had [...] of lines, the largest electric network in France. Trams were up to three cars long and ran at [...] at 20-minute intervals.|$|R
