50|$|The word poffer {{is derived}} from poffen, the puffing of sleeves and {{trousers}} worn in the mid-19th century.

Toer is a term derived from the French word, touronette. Touronette is akin to feminine finery but was originally a braid with ribbons and flowers.

50|$|Connolly was {{adept at}} {{reworking}} traditional Irish fabrics and styles - including peasant blouses, flannel petticoats and shawls - {{to give them}} contemporary appeal and glamour. Perhaps her most distinctive contribution to fashion was pleated handkerchief linen - as worn by Jackie Kennedy in the official White House portrait - it took up to nine yards of Irish linen handkerchiefs to create one yard of the uncrushable <b>pleated</b> <b>fabric</b> that she pioneered. Designs were created in Ireland, and Connolly employed up to 100 women, mostly crocheting and weaving in their own homes. Although there was intricate craft in her designs, prices were lower than the typical European couture label.|$|E
50|$|The {{dress is}} a light-colored ivory {{cocktail}} dress {{in a style}} that was in vogue in the 1950s and 1960s.

40|$|This essay {{inquires}} {{into the}} structural working processes for craft, {{in particular the}} connection between epistemology and practice. Craft studies have recently emerged as methodologically circumscribed areas of research into the decorative arts. The forum for publishing the present essay is the first peer-reviewed journal that focuses on these recent methodological departures. Yet abstract meditations on the specificity of craft remain underdeveloped. The essay therefore puts forward an explicitly philosophical exploration of craft – across the twin bases of investigating material techniques (textiles) and the structural exploration of epistemological notions like intuition. It programmatically uses the orthodox canon of philosophical discourses in order to inquire into the relationship between episteme and techne. Platonic and Aristotelian postulates are used to trace the origin and variation in understanding the connection between knowing and making. The metaphor of weaving – instrumental to many Platonic discourses – is employed as the 'thread' running through the discussion. This metaphor is also employed to guide the application of episteme and techne to textile production, in particular through a detailed structural analysis of the <b>pleated</b> <b>fabrics</b> used by Mariano Fortuny and Issey Miyake. The application of abstract thought to design discourses like textile production or fashion that are perceived habitually as superficial and atheoretical often takes recourse to speculative and associative processes, frequently {{with the aid of}} secondary research sources only. In contrast, my work employs a detailed analysis of textual foundations as well as a concrete material inquiry into the production processes for the chosen textile examples. Beyond demonstrating the etymological connection between 'text' and 'textile', it proposes a structural reading of the production for the pleated textiles, offering a new approach to the fashion designs of Fortuny and Miyake, as well as others...|$|R
40|$|<b>Pleated</b> wool <b>fabrics</b> were {{prepared}} by the treatment with ethylenediamine (EDA) at 90 °C for 30 min. The degree of set, tensile property and dyeing of the treated fabrics have been discussed {{in relation to the}} concentration of EDA in the treatment system. No significant decreases in tensile strength and elongation, and great increases of exhaustion of synthetic and natural dyes were observed. Pleat and flat set were successfully attained {{in a wide range of}} the concentration of EDA. Excellent dyeability and setability of the fabrics obtained were considered to be associated with the existence of new crosslink, β-N-(2 -aminoethyl) alanino-β-aminoalanine and the pendant group, β-N-(2 -aminoethyl) aminoalanine produced by the reaction of EDA with dehydroalanine intermediate. © 2009 The Korean Fiber Society and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg GmbH...|$|R

40|$|Throughout {{the era of}} globalization, {{industrial}} development and transportation have brought about hazardous air environment especially in developing countries. Southeast Asia with large number of labor and natural sources has expanded manufacturing area {{as well as the}} problem of local community being reluctant air pollutant. It seems to be double suffocation with emitting frequently forest fire fume covering some parts of Thailand and Indonesia. These reasons can lead to around 5 -time exceeding of annual standard in the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQs). Without fresh ventilation, filtration has become more important but it may be not affordable for low income people. So this study aims to develop low cost air dust purifier being suitable for hot and humid climate based on NAAQs and BS EN. Based on low cost and general air purifying techniques, fabric filter and solid fibre mop were selected for air cleaning efficiency evaluation in laboratory. For fabric filter, in one cubic meter wooden box, <b>pleated</b> <b>fabric</b> filter was installed in the middle of box and body spray was sourced as air particulate matter sized 2. 5 micron (PM 2. 5).

40|$|Purpose: Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) is {{strictly}} {{affected by the}} concentration of total suspended particulate matter (TSP). Air filtration {{is by far the}} most feasible suggestion to improve IAQ. Unfortunately, highly effective HEPA filters also have a few major weaknesses that have hindered their widespread use. There is therefore a renewed interest in developing novel, cost-effective filtration systems. We have recently reported the development of cardboard-based filters for bacterial removal that were further implemented and tested herein.  Methods: A parallelepiped filter manufactured by aligning strips of corrugated cardboard and surrounded by a cardboard frame was specifically designed with an internal pocket holding a partially cut antistatic <b>pleated</b> <b>fabric</b> (HP). This filter, together with its parent version (CTRL) and a commercially sourced specimen (CAF), were assessed comparatively in a long-time test to assess their effectiveness on TSP removal.  Results: We found that the TSP abatement efficiency (E%) of the HP filter was relatively high and invariable over the 93 days of test and the pressure drop (PD%) decrease because of filter clogging was moderate. Most important, the HP filter was the most effective if assessed in terms of overall yield (Y%) and its performance was quite constant over the entire period considered.  Conclusions: This work disclosed this novel class of corrugated cardboard-based filters as promising tools to ameliorate IAQ in light of their good TSP removal properties that endure over time. Moreover, cardboard is a lightweight, inexpensive, and eco-friendly material and corrugated cardboard-based air filters are very easy to shape and mount on and/or replace in existing ventilation systems...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this design was to {{integrate}} various apparel construction techniques used throughout history in one creative garment. Process: Inspiration for the design came from recent trips to Paris, London, and Milan. My imagination was sparked while I was engrossed in the stories and images of these historical cities were people have lived their lives and fashion evolved over hundreds of years. Drawing inspiration from a boat ride down the Seine River in Paris and the miles-long network of canals, the monuments and carvings at Westminster Abbey, the Wedding Dress 1775 - 2014 exhibit at the Victoria and Albert Museum, and many other historical locations, the cut, proportion, and details of the garment came into fruition. Graffiti seen throughout Paris and Milan along with the stained glass windows and vivid colors at Westminster Abbey was {{the inspiration for the}} unique textile design on the garment which is meant to stimulate thought and emotion. A simple leotard was created to go underneath the garment as to cover the body but not take away from the over garment. Techniques: Creating the front bodice of small even pleats was a long and precise process. The size, placement, and angle of the pleats was detailed work to assure that they fit over the chest correctly and would open up beyond the chest so the viewer could clearly see the textile design. Once the <b>pleated</b> <b>fabric</b> was sewn together, it was carefully drawn on to create the unique textile design. The dramatic ruff was created using traditional methods and was practiced a few times to assure the final product was accurate, clean, and balanced. Contribution: Combining the draping, pleating, neck ruff, bold textile art, and specific details the garment has a unique and unseen design combination and aesthetic to contribute to the design community.
