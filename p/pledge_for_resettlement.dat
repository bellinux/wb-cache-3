40|$|Although {{millions}} of people globally are displaced annually, resettlement has a poor history for achieving the objective of leaving people who are resettled 'no worse off after project implementation than before'. While excellent guidelines and policies <b>for</b> <b>resettlement</b> have been established, resettlement/displacement projects still do not succeed in resettling affected peoples {{in a way that}} they are eventually better off. Consensus was reached by a Delphi panel of experts on a set of guidelines <b>for</b> <b>resettlement</b> projects. It is proposed that, supplementing the existing frameworks and guidelines <b>for</b> <b>resettlement</b> with well-established project management principles - including a phased project management approach - the chances of executing a resettlement project successfully are much higher. This paper proposes an improved framework and valuable guidelines <b>for</b> future <b>resettlement</b> projects[URL]...|$|R

50|$|Even the UNHCR {{resettlement}} {{officers who}} submit refugees' dossiers to potential receiving countries may themselves bias the selection. For example, {{it was revealed}} that UNHCR staff in Nairobi extorted money from refugee <b>for</b> <b>resettlement</b> places. Apart from that, large families {{are more likely to be}} considered <b>for</b> <b>resettlement</b> than singles, because resettlement officers have to work through fewer case files per submitted person when referring large families. Also single men, who are likely to receive a more thorough and time consuming security screening from resettlement states, are less likely to be submitted.|$|R
50|$|India {{agreed to}} take in 165 refugees, with the first group {{arriving}} in March 2006.

40|$|<b>Resettlement</b> {{of people}} <b>for</b> {{conservation}} is a contentious issue, but remains an important policy for conserving species like tigers which require vast, inviolate habitats. Recommendations to resettle communities should ideally be supported with careful {{evaluation of the}} needs of wildlife, socio-economic characteristics of dependent communities and their attitudes, and we present one such case study. Using a semi-structured questionnaire survey of 158 households across a gradient of tiger occupancy, we found overwhelming preference <b>for</b> <b>resettlement</b> among pastoralist Gujjars and hence an unexpected conservation opportunity to expand inviolate areas for tigers in the western Terai Arc Landscape. The main ‘push factors’ identified were declining forest productivity adversely affecting incomes and lack of access to education and health facilities. Thus, our findings represent a rare instance where excessive extraction of natural resources, recognized to be detrimental for biodiversity, is also the primary driver <b>for</b> <b>resettlement.</b> The desire <b>for</b> <b>resettlement</b> was also re-enforced by losses of livestock to diseases (72. 7...|$|R
