However, some researchers recently brought into the attention the necessity of coarse particle for poultry feed to complement the natural design and function of gastrointestinal tract (GIT). [...] and [...] discussed that the GIT retention time decreased {{due to lack of}} gizzard function that eventually gave negative impact on live performance. , compared the performance of 21 day old broilers fed with different feed particle size; 0.716 mm and 1.196 mm. They found that the subject fed with larger particle size feed showed better <b>performance.</b> , <b>evaluating</b> different corn particle sizes in the broiler feed found that the largest particle size (2.242 mm) gave better feed intake than the other particle sizes tested (0.781, 0.950, 1.042 and 1.109 mm). [...] however argued that the development of broiler was influenced by changing particle sizes. However variation in particle size between 0.5-1 mm usually did not have any effect on the broilers. Very fine particles (<0.5 mm) may impair the broilers performance due to presence of dust that cause respiratory problems, increase water intake, feed presence in the drinkers and increase litter moisture. , in their recent study concluded that although fine particle sizes (0.27 mm) enhanced broilers live performance, the pelleted feed did not.|$|E
