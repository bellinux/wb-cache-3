Martha Nussbaum wrote that he was [...] "as close to being a feminist as a powerful man of his generation could be." [...] In both his first and second marriages, he supported his wives in their careers and helped with the children more than was common for men at the time. In the 1970s, when Nussbaum's thesis supervisor, G. E. L. Owen, was harassing female students, and she decided nevertheless to support him, Williams told her, during a walk along the backs at Cambridge: [...] "ou know, there is a <b>price</b> <b>you</b> are paying for this support and encouragement.

The supposed collaborator said calmly, [...] "Please refrain from publishing any information – if not, this is the <b>price</b> <b>you</b> will pay." [...] After the kneeling man warned Internet users against collaborating with Valor por Tamaulipas, the gunman pulled the trigger and shot him in the head, apparently killing the man. The administrator of Valor por Tamaulipas responded by posting a message on Facebook and saying that he will not take a stance on the authenticity of the video, but stated that he does not recognize the man. Notinfomex blog website reported that the Gulf Cartel was behind the video, but the information and authenticity have not been officially confirmed.|$|E

2500|$|TV {{critic and}} {{columnist}} Charlie Brooker stated on his show, Charlie Brooker's Screenwipe, his {{worry that the}} controversy {{would lead to a}} chilling effect on comedy, and that the BBC and others would self-censor too much in future. He {{went on to say that}} the attitude displayed by the complainants and the BBC's backing down would have, in earlier times, precluded the production of much of what was at the time edgy comedy and made culture poorer for it (citing Monty Python's Flying Circus, The Day Today and The Young Ones amongst others as shows that would have not been commissioned owing to their controversial content). While pouring scorn on those who had complained without seeing the programme, and attacking newspapers that attempted to stir up further controversy (in particular the Daily Mail), he did not appear to defend Brand and Ross in particular, stating that the possibility of people being offended by some misjudged humour is [...] "the <b>price</b> <b>you</b> pay for freedom of speech." [...] In a further column in The Guardian, he reiterated this point as well as saying that [...] "people who retrospectively complain to Ofcom about material they've only read about second-hand are, in essence, a bunch of sanctimonious crybabies indulging in a wretched form of masturbation." ...|$|E
