25|$|Gregorian chants were {{organized}} initially into four, then eight, and finally 12 modes. Typical melodic features include a characteristic ambitus, and also characteristic intervallic patterns {{relative to a}} referential mode final, incipits and cadences, the use of reciting tones at a particular distance from the final, around which the other notes of the melody revolve, and a vocabulary of musical motifs woven together through a process called centonization to create families of related chants. The scale patterns are organized against a background pattern formed of conjunct and disjunct tetrachords, producing a larger <b>pitch</b> <b>system</b> called the gamut. The chants can be sung by using six-note patterns called hexachords. Gregorian melodies are traditionally written using neumes, an early form of musical notation from which the modern four-line and five-line staff developed. Multi-voice elaborations of Gregorian chant, known as organum, were an early stage {{in the development of}} Western polyphony.|$|E
25|$|From the mid-fifteenth century {{there are}} {{relatively}} {{large numbers of}} works that have survived from English composers in documents such as the early fifteenth century Old Hall Manuscript. Probably the first, {{and one of the}} best represented is Leonel Power (c. 1380–1445), who was probably the choir master of Christ Church, Canterbury and enjoyed noble patronage from Thomas of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Clarence and John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford (1389–1435). John Dunstaple (or Dunstable) was the most celebrated composer of the 'Contenance Angloise' (English manner), a distinctive style of polyphony that used full, rich harmonies based on the third and sixth, which was highly influential in the fashionable Burgundian court of Philip the Good. Nearly all his manuscript music in England was lost during the Dissolution of the Monasteries (1536–40), but some of his works have been reconstructed from copies found in continental Europe, particularly in Italy. The existence of these copies is testament to his widespread fame within Europe. He may have been the first composer to provide liturgical music with an instrumental accompaniment. Royal interest in music is suggested by the works attributed to Roy Henry in the Old Hall Manuscript, suspected to be Henry IV or Henry V. This tradition was continued by figures such as Walter Frye (c. 1420–75), whose masses were recorded and highly influential in France and the Netherlands. Similarly, John Hothby (c. 1410–87), an English Carmelite monk, who travelled widely and, although leaving little composed music, wrote several theoretical treatises, including La Calliopea legale, and is credited with introducing innovations to the medieval <b>pitch</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

The novel hydraulic <b>pitch</b> control <b>system</b> is driven by a novel high efficiency and high response hydraulic servo <b>system.</b> The <b>pitch</b> controller, designed by two degree-of-freedom (2 -DOF) motion control with feedback linearization, is developed to enhance the controllability and stability of the <b>pitch</b> control <b>system.</b> Furthermore, the full-scale testbed of the hydraulic <b>pitch</b> control <b>system</b> of a large wind turbine is developed for practically experimental verification.

5000|$|The {{load and}} {{operating}} situation of pitch bearings are for rolling element bearings comparatively unfavorable.

Furthermore, the high loads can lead to truncation of the contact ellipse. Due to the small reciprocating movements calculation methods to estimate the bearing service life [...] and the friction torque are not useable for pitch bearings. Newer controlling concepts of pitch control, like individual pitch control, will lead to smaller and more frequent oscillation amplitudes which could favor false brinelling and fretting corrosion.|$|E

Some found the tonearm as supplied was not accurately calibrated or properly {{aligned with the}} platter, {{but it can be}} tweaked and adjusted to perform well. The platter in some cases exhibited noticeable warp or axial run-out, which appears to be in part due to the ceramic ring magnetic that secures the platter to the spindle not being glued correctly to the underside of the platter. Some reviewers complained that the <b>pitch</b> <b>system</b> was not calibrated accurately, although not off by much. On later production models, probably the Pro TT-2 only, it is reported that access holes are provided {{on the bottom of the}} turntable base to permit pitch calibration using a screwdriver. Others considered the LCD display to be of little practical value since the pitch value shown is not precise. Also, in some cases the stylus pressure ring on the tonearm counterbalance weight assembly turns much too freely. And, unfortunately, the dust cover hinges eventually fail due to cracking at the bottom of the plastic housing for the counterbalance spring which is under the constant load of the stiff spring. One failed hinge keeps the dust cover from staying open when raised.|$|E
