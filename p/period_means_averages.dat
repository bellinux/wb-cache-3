40|$|Abstract. —To {{understand}} how logging of second-growth forests affects populations of coastal cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii clarkii, we examined trout relative abundance, body condition (mass relative to length), and physical and thermal habitat {{in the summer}} and winter in four headwater streams (two treatment streams and two nonlogged control streams) over a 6 -year period (2 years prelogging [1997 – 1998] and 4 years postlogging [1999 – 2002]). This {{is one of the first}} efforts to conduct a multiyear, replicated stream, before-and-after experiment on this scale to assess the effects of logging on fish and habitat. In the treatment streams, 21 % of the watershed area was logged by clear-cutting (no scarification or slash-burning). Careful logging approaches were employed to remove most of the riparian overstory (i. e., no machines were used within 5 m of stream, logs were felled and yarded away from riparian zones, all shrubs were left behind, and large wood was left in streams). Because a cooler summer climate occurred coincidentally with our postlogging <b>period</b> (the <b>mean</b> daily <b>average</b> summer air temperature was 1 – 28 C cooler than the temperature during the prelogging <b>period),</b> the <b>mean</b> <b>average</b> and <b>mean</b> maximum daily stream temperatures declined after the logging period in the control streams and remained the same in the treatment streams. After accounting for the effects of climate, logging had warmed treatment streams by about 18 C. We could not detect any logging treatment effects on summer or winter relative abundance or condition, nor were any changes evident t...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe {{intramedullary}} skeletal kinetic distractor (ISKD) {{is one of}} {{the relatively}} recent methods developed to overcome the complications of conventional bone lengthening methods, such as external fixators. These complications include pain, muscle transfixation, pin-tract infection, reduced joint motion, and prolonged fixation time. However, ISKD-specific complications such as uncontrollable lengthening and hardware failure make the outcomes of ISKD lengthening questionable. In this article, we review published literature on the efficacy and complications of the ISKD device. MethodsA database search was conducted in PubMed, Ovid Medline, Ovid Full Text, Springer link, EBSCO Medline, Science Direct, ISI Web of Knowledge, and Google Scholar. We included English articles with extractable data about the study population and outcomes, reporting ISKD implantation in the femur or tibia of skeletally mature patients.

40|$|Graduation date: 1976 The Purpose of the Study The central {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if certain personality characteristics differ between community college persisters and those who drop out of school. The following 12 a priori hypotheses involving six Adjective Check List personality scales were tested: 1. Male persisters would have a significant higher <b>mean</b> <b>average</b> than male non-persisters on the Deference (Def) Scale. 2. Female persisters would have a significantly higher <b>mean</b> <b>average</b> than female non-persisters on the Deference (Def) Scale. 3. Male persisters would have a significantly higher <b>mean</b> <b>average</b> than male non-persisters on the Succorance (SUC) scale. 4. Female persisters would have a significantly higher <b>mean</b> <b>average</b> than female non-persisters on the Succorance (SUC) scale. 5. Male persisters would have a significantly higher <b>mean</b> <b>average</b> than male non-persisters on the Order (Ord) Scale. 6. Female persisters would have a significantly higher <b>mean</b> <b>average</b> than female non-persisters on the Order (Ord) Scale. 7. Male non-persisters would have a significantly higher <b>mean</b> <b>average</b> than male persisters on the Autonomy (Aut) Scale. 8. Female non-persisters would have a significantly higher <b>mean</b> <b>average</b> than female persisters on the Autonomy (Aut) Scale. 9. Male non-persisters would have a significantly higher <b>mean</b> <b>average</b> than male persisters on the Exhibition (Exb) Scale. 10. Female non-persisters would have a significantly higher <b>mean</b> <b>average</b> than female persisters on the Exhibition (Exb) Scale. 11. Male non-persisters would have a significantly higher <b>mean</b> <b>average</b> than male persisters on the Change (Cha) Scale. 12. Female non-persisters would have a significantly higher <b>mean</b> <b>average</b> than female persisters on the Change (Cha) Scale. Procedures The project was conducted at Mt. Hood Community College, in Gresham, Oregon. One hundred and seventy-three students participated; 49 women persisters and 24 women dropouts, and 63 men persisters and 37 men who dropped out the first four weeks of spring term, 1974. The data were statistically analyzed using the F-test statistic for main effects and a t-value statistic for the subanalysis of data. Selected Findings Each of the 12 a priori hypotheses was rejected as no significant differences occurred between persisters on the following Adjective Check List scales: Order, Exhibition, Autonomy, Change, Succorance, or Deference. However, significant differences did exist on six scales when the enrollment category effect was tested. The male persisters scored significantly higher on the Defensiveness, Personal Adjustment, Intraception, Affiliation, and Number of Favorable Adjectives checked scales. And male and female persisters scored significantly higher than non-persisters on the Total Number of Adjectives Checked scale. Selected Conclusions Although all a priori hypotheses were rejected, there were a number of related findings. For instance, there were more differences between male persisters and non-persisters than female persisters when compared to female non-persisters. Differences between the categories of men occurred six times, while occurring only once among women. Generally speaking, the male dropouts appear to have a less positive self-image than male persisters. However, because personality differences vary so much among dropouts, and between persisters and dropouts, it was concluded that personality tests should not be used to attempt to predict those prone to dropping out, or to generalize that all dropouts exhibit certain unique personality traits or characteristics when compared to persisters. Selected Recommendations Based on the findings and conclusions of this project, it is recommended that additional studies be conducted to examine the conclusions listed above and the implications listed in Chapter V. In addition, it is felt that all Oregon Community Colleges should cooperatively study the dropout problem, and that the exit interview should receive more emphasis at all community colleges...|$|R

40|$|Changes {{in water}} {{temperature}} can have important consequences for aquatic ecosystems, with some species being sensitive even to small shifts in temperature during {{some or all}} of their lifecycle. While many studies report increasing regional and global air temperatures, evidence of changes in river water temperature has thus far been site-specific and often from sites heavily influenced by human activities that themselves could lead to warming. Here we present a tiered assessment of changing river water temperature, covering England and Wales with data from 2, 773 locations. We use novel statistical approaches to detect trends in irregularly sampled spot measurements taken between 1990 and 2006. During this 17 [*]year <b>period,</b> on <b>average,</b> <b>mean</b> water temperature increased by 0. 03 [*]°C per year (± 0. 002 [*]°C) and positive changes in water temperature were observed at 2, 385 (86 %) sites. Examination of catchments, where there has been limited human influence on hydrological response, shows that changes in river flow have had little influence on these water temperature trends. In the absence of other systematic influences on water temperature, it is inferred that anthropogenically-driven climate change is driving some of this trend in water temperature...|$|R
