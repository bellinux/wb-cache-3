500|$|The Honoured Dead Memorial, a {{sandstone}} edifice {{commissioned by}} Cecil Rhodes and designed by Sir Herbert Baker, was erected {{to commemorate the}} defenders who fell during the Siege. Twenty-seven soldiers are entombed in the memorial, which was made from stone quarried in the Matopo Hills in Zimbabwe. [...] It bears an inscription by Rudyard Kipling: [...] "This for a charge to our children in sign of the <b>price</b> <b>we</b> paid, The price that we paid for freedom that comes unsoiled to your hand; Read, revere and uncover, here are the victors laid, They who died for their City, being sons of the land". Long Cecil, the gun manufactured in the De Beers workshops during the Siege, is mounted on the stylobate (facing the Free State), surrounded by shells from the Boer Long Tom.|$|E
500|$|For his {{leadership}} during the assault and the push inland Shoup {{was awarded the}} Medal of Honor and the British Distinguished Service Order. For his role in planning the invasion {{he was awarded the}} Legion of Merit with [...] "V" [...] device. He also was awarded the Purple Heart for the combat wounds he suffered {{during the course of the}} campaign. Ten years after the assault, Shoup remarked of the operation, [...] "there was never a doubt in the minds of those ashore what the final outcome of the battle for Tarawa would be. There was for some seventy-six hours, however, considerable haggling with the enemy over the exact <b>price</b> <b>we</b> would have to pay." [...] In 1968, he returned to Tarawa to dedicate a memorial to the battle and to the American and Japanese troops who had died there.|$|E

500|$|Many {{survivors}} of the tragedy refused to blame anyone. Survivor John Jacques wrote, [...] "I blame nobody. I am not anxious to blame anybody... I {{have no doubt that}} those who had to do with its management meant well and tried to do the best they could under the circumstances." [...] Another survivor, Francis Webster, was quoted as having said, [...] "Was I sorry that I chose to come by hand cart? No. Neither then nor any minute of my life since. The <b>price</b> <b>we</b> paid to become acquainted with God was a privilege to pay and I am thankful that I was privileged to come in the Martin Hand Cart Company."

500|$|On November 13, the {{campaign}} released a [...] called [...] "Tough on Terror" [...] {{in which a}} hypothetical terrorist attack occurs in a shopping mall. The ad blames inept border security for the attack and flashes images of an injured child and a wrecked train. After Tancredo gives his approval for the message with the comment [...] "I approve this message because someone needs to say it," [...] a voiceover states, [...] "There are consequences to open borders beyond the 20 million aliens {{who have come to}} take our jobs... the <b>price</b> <b>we</b> pay for spineless politicians who refuse to defend our borders against those who come to kill." [...] Since its release, the ad received criticism from some who called it [...] "cheap" [...] and [...] "blatant fearmongering." [...] Bowdoin College political scientist Michael Franz likened the advertisement to the Daisy ad run by Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1964 Presidential election claiming that the election of Barry Goldwater would lead to a nuclear war. The other Republican candidates in the race did not comment on the ad.|$|E
500|$|Walsh joined London-based {{property}} and brewing conglomerate Grand Metropolitan (Grand Met) in 1982 {{as a financial}} planner and account manager for their brewing division Watney, Mann & Truman. By 1984–5, at his request, he had moved into a sales and marketing role. In 1986 he became the brewing division's chief financial officer (CFO), where {{he came to the}} attention of Grand Met's chairman Allen Sheppard after he reformed the financial reporting system. In 1987, Walsh moved to New York to become CFO of Grand Met's 100 property-strong Intercontinental Hotels division. There he was tasked with acquiring properties, but having arrived at the height of what he identified as a real estate bubble, he argued that, [...] "at that <b>price</b> <b>we</b> should be selling, not buying". In 1988, he helped to negotiate the sale of the chain for $2.3 billion in cash (a price to earnings ratio of 52) to the Saison Group, in what he later described as [...] "the deal of the decade". Even before the bubble burst, it was suggested that the Japanese company was overpaying for the chain; one analyst described their valuation of Intercontinental as [...] "off the chart". Saison sold the chain in 1998 for $2.8 billion, having added a further 87 hotels.|$|E

Recently {{there has been}} renewed debate within the literature about whether these switching costs lead to higher <b>prices.</b> <b>We</b> build a theoretical model of dynamic competition and solve it analytically {{for a wide range}} of switching costs. We provide a simple condition which determines whether switching costs raise or lower long-run <b>prices.</b> <b>We</b> also show that switching costs are more likely to increase prices in the short-run. Finally switching costs redistribute surplus across time, and as such are shown to sometimes increase consumer welfare. ...|$|R

2500|$|Israeli {{officials}} said the British informed them Friday {{that they would be}} withdrawing the monitoring team but did not provide a date. U.S. {{officials said}} the Israelis and the Palestinians were notified as the three British guards on duty at the time departed. Stuart Tuttle, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv, said that [...] "The withdrawal decision was made on the ground and not in coordination with the Israelis". Senior U.S. {{officials said the}}y {{had no choice but to}} abandon the facility, even though they realized it might undermine the Palestinian Authority, and that they did not make public their concerns because they believed publicity would have made the U.S. and British personnel the targets of attacks. A senior administration official said: [...] "That is the <b>price</b> <b>we</b> pay. Our first responsibility is the safety of American and British monitors". State Department spokesman J. Adam Ereli denied any coordination with Israel and said: [...] "Such accusations are baseless and ignore the facts, quite frankly".|$|E
2500|$|New York Times critic Manohla Dargis, who {{designated}} the film a New York Times critics' pick, {{said that the}} film [...] "shows {{the dark side of}} that war.

[...] Continued Dargis: There is much else to say about the movie, which ends with the harrowing siege of Bin Laden's hideaway by the Navy SEALs (played by, among others, Joel Edgerton and Chris Pratt), much of it shot to approximate the queasy, weirdly unreal green of night-vision goggles. Ms. Bigelow's direction here is unexpectedly stunning, at once bold and intimate: she has a genius for infusing even large-scale action set pieces with the human element. One of the most significant images is of a pool of blood on a floor. It's pitiful, really, and as the movie heads toward its emphatically non-triumphant finish, it is impossible not to realize with anguish that all that came before– the pain, the suffering and the compromised ideals– has led to this.|$|E
40|$|We {{determine}} empirically how automakers accommodate shocks to demand. Using data on production, sales, and transaction <b>prices,</b> <b>we</b> estimate {{a dynamic}} profit maximization {{model of the}} firm. We demonstrate that when an automaker is hit with a vehicle-specific demand shock, sales respond immediately and prices respond very modestly. Further, when accounting for non-convexities in the cost function, production responds with a delay. Over time, shocks are absorbed almost entirely through adjustments in sales and production rather than <b>prices.</b> <b>We</b> examine two recent demand shocks: the Ford Explorer/Firestone tire recall of 2000, and th...|$|R
