2500|$|The {{frequency}} spectrum of <b>pink</b> <b>noise</b> is linear in logarithmic scale; it has equal power in bands that are proportionally wide. This means that <b>pink</b> <b>noise</b> would have equal {{power in the}} frequency range from 40 to 60Hz as in the band from 4000 to 6000Hz. Since humans hear in such a proportional space, where a doubling of frequency (an octave) is perceived the same regardless of actual frequency (40–60Hz is heard as the same interval and distance as 4000–6000Hz), every octave contains {{the same amount of}} energy and thus <b>pink</b> <b>noise</b> is often used as a reference signal in audio engineering. The spectral power density, compared with white noise, decreases by 3 dB per octave (density proportional to 1/f).

In this paper, we investigate statistical characteristics of blinks and blink rate variability of 11 subjects.

The signals from the two front electrodes were then analyzed, and times of the blinks were detected. We discovered that compared to the resting sessions, reading session is characterized by a lower number of blinks. However, {{there was no significant difference}} in standard deviation in the blink rate variability. We also noticed that in terms of complexity measures, the blink rate variability is located somewhere in between white and <b>pink</b> <b>noises,</b> being closer to the white noise during reading. We also found that the average of inter-blink intervals increases during reading/memorization, thus longer inter-blink intervals could be associated with a mental workload...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to assess the specific capabilities of the defect energy parameter technique for global damage detection developed by Saleeb and coworkers. The feature extraction is the most important capability in any damage-detection technique. Features are any parameters extracted from the processed measurement data in order to enhance damage detection. The damage feature extraction capability was studied extensively by analyzing various simulation results. The practical significance in structural health monitoring is that the detection at early stages of small-size defects is always desirable. The amount of changes in the structure's response due to these small defects was determined to show the needed level of accuracy in the experimental methods. The arrangement of fine/extensive sensor network to measure required data for the detection is an "unlimited" ability, but there is a difficulty to place extensive number of sensors on a structure. Therefore, an investigation was conducted using the measurements of coarse sensor network. The white and the <b>pink</b> <b>noises,</b> which cover most of the frequency ranges that are typically encountered in the many measuring devices used (e. g., accelerometers, strain gauges, etc.) are added to the displacements to investigate the effect of noisy measurements in the detection technique. The noisy displacements and the noisy damage parameter values are used to study the signal feature reconstruction using wavelets. The enhancement of the feature extraction capability was successfully achieved by the wavelet theory...|$|R

2500|$|Since the {{development}} of digital signal processing (DSP), {{there have been many}} pieces of equipment and computer software designed to shift the bulk of the work of system calibration from human auditory interpretation to software algorithms that run on microprocessors.

2500|$|The {{practice}} of naming kinds of noise after colors started with white noise, a signal whose spectrum has equal power within any equal interval of frequencies.

Other color names, like pink, red, and blue were then given to noise with other spectral profiles, often (but not always) in reference to the color of light with similar spectra. Some of those names have standard definitions in certain disciplines, while others are very informal and poorly defined. Many of these definitions assume a signal with components at all frequencies, with a power spectral density per unit of bandwidth proportional to 1/f'β and hence they are examples of power-law noise. [...] For instance, the spectral density of white noise is flat (β = 0), while flicker or <b>pink</b> <b>noise</b> has β = 1, and Brownian noise has β = 2.|$|E

Speech recognition systems have their performance negatively affected in noisy environments or {{in the presence of}} other speech signals. The limits of these masking techniques for different levels of the signal-to-noise ratio are discussed. We show the robustness of the spectral masking techniques against four types of noise: white, pink, brown and human speech noise (bubble noise). The main contribution of this work is to analyze the performance limits of recognition systems  using spectral masking. We obtain an increase of 18 % on the speech hit rate, when the speech signals were corrupted by other speech signals or bubble noise, with different signal-to-noise ratio of approximately 1, 10 and 20 dB. On the other hand, applying the ideal binary masks to mixtures corrupted by white, <b>pink</b> and brown <b>noise,</b> results an average growth of 9 % on the speech hit rate, with the same different signal-to-noise ratio.

2500|$|Neural {{oscillations}} {{have been}} most widely studied in neural activity generated by large groups of neurons. Large-scale activity can be measured by techniques such as EEG. In general, EEG signals have a broad spectral content similar to <b>pink</b> <b>noise,</b> but [...] also reveal oscillatory activity in specific frequency bands. The first discovered and best-known frequency band is alpha activity (7.5–12.5 Hz) that can be detected from the occipital lobe during relaxed wakefulness and which increases when the eyes are closed. Other frequency bands are: delta (14Hz), theta (48Hz), beta (1330Hz) and gamma (3070Hz) frequency band, where faster rhythms such as gamma activity {{have been linked to}} cognitive processing. Indeed, EEG signals change dramatically during sleep and show a transition from faster frequencies to increasingly slower frequencies such as alpha waves. In fact, different sleep stages are commonly characterized by their spectral content. Consequently, neural oscillations have been linked to cognitive states, such as awareness and consciousness.|$|E
2500|$|Pitch is {{perceived}} as how [...] "low" [...] or [...] "high" [...] a sound is and represents the cyclic, repetitive nature of the vibrations that make up sound. For simple sounds, pitch relates to {{the frequency of the}} slowest vibration in the sound (called the fundamental harmonic). In the case of complex sounds, pitch perception can vary. Sometimes individuals identify different pitches for the same sound, based on their personal experience of particular sound patterns. Selection of a particular pitch is determined by pre-conscious examination of vibrations, including their frequencies and the balance between them. Specific attention is given to recognising potential harmonics. [...] Every sound is placed on a pitch continuum from low to high. For example: white noise (random noise spread evenly across all frequencies) sounds higher in pitch than <b>pink</b> <b>noise</b> (random noise spread evenly across octaves) as white noise has more high frequency content. [...] Figure 1 shows an example of pitch recognition. During the listening process, each sound is analysed for a repeating pattern (See Figure 1: orange arrows) and the results forwarded to the auditory cortex as a single pitch of a certain height (octave) and chroma (note name).|$|E

The system featured a then-new technology called [...] "signal analysis", which required white and <b>pink</b> <b>noise</b> to be pumped through the speakers, in order to set the active equalizers so as to minimize feedback and distortion. The pink and white noise analysis had to be performed twice: once with the hall empty, and then again with the audience present, which many concertgoers found annoying. Additionally, Rundgren's insistence on personally overseeing the acoustic set-up of the system left him exhausted and unable to continue, and he pulled the plug on the experiment.|$|E
