Founded in 1981, Magnolia Editions publishes fine art projects, {{including}} unique and editioned works on paper, artist books, and public art. The studio includes facilities for etching/intaglio printing as well as digital printing onto substrates such as gessoed <b>panel,</b> <b>glass,</b> leather, plexiglas, aluminum, or raw linen. Several artists have worked at Magnolia to realize major commissions for the San Francisco International Airport and the Oakland International Airport. Other recent projects have incorporated a mix of traditional and digital techniques, such as a digital photogravure method in which a 'resist' is digitally printed on an etching plate, developed by Magnolia Editions director Donald Farnsworth, and projects which merge painting and printmaking by printing acrylic color over hand-painted, three-dimensional textures.|$|E

The key trait of the process was to extract most of the silicon out of the glass for CST preparation, but leave Ba and Sr in the residue which {{had the potential to}} be employed as raw material for metallic Ba and Sr metallurgy. In the synthesis process, waste CRT <b>panel</b> <b>glass</b> was firstly treated by supercritical water (SCW) -NaOH solution for Si extraction, then sol-gel and hydrothermal treatments were used for CST preparation. 80 % of Si in the glass could be extracted into the solution, while Sr and Ba were enriched in the residue in the form of Sr(2) SiO(4) and Ba(2) Si(3) O(8), respectively. Sr and Ba contents in the residue were 2 - 3 times higher than those in the raw glass. SEM, XRD and TEM results indicated that CST was successfully synthesized.

In this application, individual <b>glass</b> <b>panel</b> is supported on two sides (roof and foundation) and subjected to in-plane shear force (lateral wind), out-of-plane distributed load (perpendicular wind) and in-plane compression force (self weight of the roof, snow). While several studies on glass plate behaviour under distributed load and column buckling exist, shear buckling of two sides supported <b>glass</b> <b>panel</b> has not been investigated yet. Therefore, research on this topic gives original and innovative importance to both theoretical (<b>glass</b> <b>panel</b> under shear loading) and practical (use of glass envelope for building stabilization) applications. Two structural concepts are developed: point support concept - the <b>glass</b> <b>panel</b> {{is attached to the}} substructure by bolted connections at corners linear support concept - the <b>glass</b> <b>panel</b> is glued to the substructure by two shorter sides. The local behaviour of the connection devices and the global behaviour of the <b>glass</b> <b>panel</b> under in-plane shear force are studied by means of experimental investigations, numerical modelling and parametric analyses. Experimental investigation and numerical simulation of connection devices was conducted in order to better understand the behaviour of different types of glass/substructure bolted (for point support) and glued (for linear support) connections. Deformation, stress distribution and local influence on the surrounding glass were analyzed. From these studies, the most suitable connection device for load introduction was chosen and implemented in the <b>glass</b> <b>panel.</b> Tests on full size <b>glass</b> <b>panels</b> were conducted in order to estimate the shear buckling behaviour of a <b>glass</b> <b>panel.</b> Also the influence of different boundary conditions (point and linear) and load interaction (in-plane shear force with out-of-plane distributed load and in-plane compression force) on global <b>glass</b> <b>panel</b> behaviour were analyzed. The specimen deformation, the stress distribution and the failure mode have been analyzed. Advanced numerical models of point and linear supported <b>glass</b> <b>panel</b> were implemented using the Finite Element Code Ansys. Elastic buckling analysis was used to determine the critical shear buckling force, shear buckling coefficient and shear buckling mode shape, further used as the initial geometrical imperfection. By means of nonlinear buckling analyses the global <b>glass</b> <b>panel</b> behaviour was studied analysing <b>glass</b> <b>panel</b> deformations, stresses distribution and support reactions. The influence of initial imperfection shape was investigated as well as the interaction of in-plane shear force with out-of-plane distributed load and in-plane compression force. The models were validated by comparing their results with experimental measurements. The parametric study was carried out to identify the most important parameters, evaluating their influence on shear buckling behaviour. The influence of the <b>glass</b> <b>panel</b> and connection device geometrical/material properties on critical shear force, global deformation, stress distribution and support reaction could be determined. A simple method for preliminary design of <b>glass</b> <b>panels</b> subjected to in-plane shear force was proposed by developing formulas, graphs and curves for determining the <b>glass</b> <b>panel</b> shear buckling resistance.

40|$|Indium {{is one of}} the {{strategically}} important materials, {{which have}} been characterized as critical by various industrialized countries. Despite its high relevance, only low recycling rates are realized. Its main application is in indium tin oxide (ITO), which is used in the production of liquid crystal displays (LCD). However, recovery strategies for indium from LCDs are not yet being implemented in recycling practices. Although LCDs consist of a sandwich compound with additional materials such as glass (80 % ± 5 %) and polarizer foils (20 % ± 5 %), recently published recycling approaches focus mainly on the recovery of indium exclusively. This study, first of all, provides information about {{the quantity and quality of}} the materials applied in the LCD panels of the various equipment types investigated, such as notebooks, tablets, mobile phones, smartphones, PC monitors, and LCD TVs. The highest indium mass fraction per mass of LCD was determined in mobile phones and the least indium was found in smartphones. Additionally, we found the significant use of contaminating metals like antimony, arsenic, lead, and strontium in the glass fraction. Thus, specific recovery strategies should focus on selected equipment types with the highest indium potential, which is directly related to the sales of new devices and the number of collected end-of-life devices. Secondly, we have developed and successfully tested a novel recycling approach for separating the sandwich compound to provide single output fractions of <b>panel</b> <b>glass,</b> polarizer foils, and an indium concentrate for subsequent recycling. Unfortunately, the strongly varying content of contaminating metals jeopardizes the recycling of this output fraction.

The surface crystallization of glass, upon sintering, limited the porosity (being about 50 %), but imparted a remarkable crushing strength to the products (up to about 80 MPa), useful for construction applications. Micro- and macro-cellular glass-ceramics, with an open porosity and very low relative density (from 40 to less than 10 %), were prepared by the sintering of fine glass powders mixed with sacrificial poly-methyl methacrylate microbeads or deposited on sacrificial poly-urethane sponges.
