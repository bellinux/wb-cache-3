5|$|In 1770, Peter Simon Pallas {{visited the}} same site as Lehmann and found a red lead mineral that had useful {{properties}} as a <b>pigment</b> in paints. The use of Siberian red lead as a paint <b>pigment</b> then developed rapidly. A bright yellow <b>pigment</b> made from crocoite also became popular.|$|E
5|$|Traces of red <b>pigment</b> {{still remain}} on the figure's body that was {{originally}} painted red overall. The feathers of her wings and the owls' feathers were also colored red, alternating with black and white. By Raman spectroscopy the red <b>pigment</b> is identified as red ochre, the black <b>pigment,</b> amorphous carbon ("lamp black") and the white <b>pigment</b> gypsum. Black <b>pigment</b> is also found on {{the background of the}} plaque, the hair and eyebrows, and on the lions' manes. The pubic triangle and the areola appear accentuated with red <b>pigment</b> but were not separately painted black. The lions' bodies were painted white. The British Museum curators assume that the horns of the headdress and part of the necklace were originally colored yellow, just as they are on a very similar clay figure from Ur. They surmise that the bracelets and rod-and-ring symbols might also have been painted yellow. However, no traces of yellow <b>pigment</b> now {{remain on the}} relief.|$|E
5|$|Azotobacter {{produces}} pigments. For example, Azotobacter chroococcum forms a dark-brown water-soluble <b>pigment</b> melanin. This process {{occurs at}} high levels of metabolism during the fixation of nitrogen, and is thought to protect the nitrogenase system from oxygen. Other Azotobacter species produce pigments from yellow-green to purple colors, including a green <b>pigment</b> which fluoresces with a yellow-green light and a <b>pigment</b> with blue-white fluorescence.|$|E
50|$|Biological <b>pigments,</b> {{also known}} simply as <b>pigments</b> or biochromes, are {{substances}} produced by living organisms that have a color resulting from selective color absorption. Biological <b>pigments</b> include plant <b>pigments</b> and flower <b>pigments.</b> Many biological structures, such as skin, eyes, feathers, fur and hair contain <b>pigments</b> such as melanin in specialized cells called chromatophores.|$|R

5|$|Cremello or Blue-eyed cream horses have rosy pink skin, {{pale blue}} eyes and cream-colored coats, {{indicating}} that <b>pigment</b> cells and <b>pigment</b> {{are present in the}} skin, eyes, and coat, but at lower levels. Dominant white horses do not have <b>pigment</b> cells, and thus no <b>pigment,</b> in the skin or coat. In addition, dominant white horses seldom have blue eyes. Other genetic factors, or combinations of genetic factors, such as the pearl gene or champagne gene, can also produce cremello-like coats. These coat colors may be distinguishable from dominant white by their unusually colored eyes.|$|E
5|$|The {{exoskeleton}} {{is generally}} blue above, with spots that coalesce, and yellow below. The red colour associated with lobsters only appears after cooking. This occurs because, in life, the red <b>pigment</b> astaxanthin {{is bound to}} a protein complex, but the complex is broken up by the heat of cooking, releasing the red <b>pigment.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the 1940s, {{the company}} began {{developing}} {{a new class of}} <b>pigments</b> called daylight fluorescent <b>pigments</b> that fluoresce in daylight. These <b>pigments</b> convert ultraviolet light to visible light, resulting in color that is comparatively brighter than other types of <b>pigments.</b> This class of <b>pigments</b> is also known as DayGlo.|$|R
5000|$|The best {{distinction}} between inks and <b>pigments</b> is that ink is a colored liquid while <b>pigments</b> are colored particles suspended in a liquid. [...] Areas colored by <b>pigments</b> usually have {{multiple layers of}} <b>pigments</b> and other mediums. The {{most important aspect of}} preserving <b>pigments</b> and inks is to identify their composition. Some techniques are not suitable for certain <b>pigments</b> and will do further harm.|$|R
30|$|<b>Pigments,</b> {{including}} synthetic {{and natural}} <b>pigments,</b> {{are widely used}} in food, brewing, and cosmetic industries. Synthetic <b>pigments</b> were extensively {{used in the past}} because of their bright color, high stability, and low cost. However, most of them are harmful to human health in varying degrees, and many people interpret the content of chemical <b>pigments</b> as a contaminant. Therefore, synthetic <b>pigments</b> have been prohibited or strictly limited in many countries. Natural <b>pigments</b> hold advantages over synthetic <b>pigments</b> in terms of nutritious and pharmacological functions (Arad and Yaron 1992). With the continuous improvements in the quality of life, the demand for natural <b>pigments</b> is growing rapidly. In Japan, China, and the United States, the numbers of natural <b>pigments</b> allowed are 97, 48, and 30, respectively (Mapari et al. 2005, 2010).|$|R
5|$|The {{hemolymph}} usually lacks any respiratory <b>pigment,</b> although {{members of}} the families Arcidae and Limidae are known to possess haemoglobin dissolved directly into the serum. In the carnivorous genus Poromya, the hemolymph has red amoebocytes containing a haemoglobin <b>pigment.</b>|$|E
5|$|Various cadmium salts {{are used}} in paint pigments, with CdS as a yellow <b>pigment</b> being the most common. Cadmium {{selenide}} is a red <b>pigment,</b> commonly called cadmium red. To painters who work with the <b>pigment,</b> cadmium provides the most brilliant and durable yellows, oranges, and reds — {{so much so that}} during production, these colors are significantly toned down before they are ground with oils and binders or blended into watercolors, gouaches, acrylics, and other paint and <b>pigment</b> formulations. Because these pigments are potentially toxic, users should use a barrier cream on the hands to prevent absorption through the skin even though the amount of cadmium absorbed into the body through the skin is reported to be less than 1%.|$|E
5|$|Another {{example is}} {{potassium}} cobaltinitrite, , {{which is used}} as artist's <b>pigment</b> {{under the name of}} Aureolin or Cobalt Yellow.|$|E
40|$|Various {{structures}} {{have been}} reported for dermoscopic features of <b>pigmented</b> Bowen&# 39;s disease (BD), which could be a mimic of various <b>pigmented</b> skin lesions. A 79 -year-old Japanese woman presented with a 3 -year history of brown-black macule on her right upper arm without symptom. Dermoscopic examination demonstrated irregular flossy streaks, irregular brown dots/globules, blue-whitish regression structures, and overlaying whitish scaly areas. We suspected <b>pigmented</b> skin lesions including seborrheic keratosis, <b>pigmented</b> eccrine poroma, and malignant melanoma and excised completely with a 5 &#x 2009;mm margin. Histopathological features were consistent with a diagnosis of <b>pigmented</b> BD. Although similar dermoscopic features might be revealed in <b>pigmented</b> skin lesions and it may occasionally be difficult to distinguish between <b>pigmented</b> BD and other <b>pigmented</b> skin lesions, dermoscopy would be useful in speculating pathologic features of <b>pigmented</b> BD...|$|R
50|$|Another {{difference}} {{is the quality of}} the <b>pigments</b> used. High quality producers use mineral-based <b>pigments</b> only. Non-mineral based <b>pigments</b> fade with age.|$|R
30|$|In the 1920 s most {{commercial}} {{titanium white}} <b>pigments</b> are composite <b>pigments</b> {{from the plant}} in Fredrikstad or Niagara Falls, see Fig.  1 b (Additional file 1 : Table S 1). After 1926, the production of pure anatase <b>pigments</b> is reported [1]. In the 1940 s, surface treatments and rutile <b>pigments</b> enter the market, but the main <b>pigments</b> continue to be composite <b>pigments</b> until they are eventually discontinued, around 1970 [5], due to their incompatibility with water-borne paints [15].|$|R
5|$|Bismuth subnitrate is a {{component}} of glazes that produces an iridescence and {{is used as a}} <b>pigment</b> in paint.|$|E
5|$|Calostoma cinnabarinum {{contains}} a <b>pigment</b> named calostomal {{that is responsible}} for its red color. The chemical structure is all-trans-16-oxohexadeca-2,4,6,8,10,12,14-heptaenoic acid.|$|E
5|$|Commelinin is {{the blue}} <b>pigment</b> from the flowers of C. communis, is a metalloanthocyanin. It {{is a complex}} of 4 Mg2+ ions {{chelating}} six anthocyanin molecules.|$|E
50|$|In {{printing}} inks mainly organic <b>pigments</b> are used, so shifting or bleaching of {{the color}} of a printing product due to presence of the UV light is usually just a matter of time. The usage of the organic <b>pigments</b> is justified especially by their inexpensive price comparing to inorganic <b>pigments.</b> The particle size of the inorganic <b>pigments</b> is often larger than on organic <b>pigments</b> thus all inorganic <b>pigments</b> are not suitable {{to be used in the}} offset printing.|$|R
30|$|Most Monascus {{yellow and}} red <b>pigments</b> {{reported}} are intracellular alcohol-soluble <b>pigments</b> combined with a few extracellular water-soluble <b>pigments</b> (Feng et al. 2012; Chen and Wu 2016). Many studies focused on the fermentation of intracellular yellow <b>pigments</b> (Xiong et al. 2015; Chen and Wu 2016; Krairak et al. 2000), but not the extracellular <b>pigments,</b> especially on the water-soluble ones. Water-soluble yellow <b>pigments</b> can be synthesized via chemical modification of intracellular alcohol-soluble <b>pigments</b> (Edward et al. 1991), which had a potential risk in food application. Recently, {{we found that the}} extracellular water-soluble yellow <b>pigments</b> could be efficiently produced by M. ruber CGMCC 10910 under high glucose concentration with low oxidoreduction potential (ORP) (Wang et al. 2017). In this study, we will investigate the effect of temperature on the biosynthesis of the water-soluble yellow <b>pigments</b> and their correlation with the expression levels of relative genes in M. ruber CGMCC 10910.|$|R

5|$|Ideain (cyanidin 3-O-galactoside) is an anthocyanin, {{a type of}} <b>pigment,</b> {{which is}} found in some red apple cultivars.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, German anatomist Johann Heinrich Meckel {{recorded}} black-brown <b>pigment</b> granules in {{the blood}} and spleen of a patient {{who had died in}} a mental hospital. Meckel was thought to have been looking at malaria parasites without realizing it; he did not mention malaria in his report. He hypothesized that the <b>pigment</b> was melanin. The causal relationship of <b>pigment</b> to the parasite was established in 1880, when French physician Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran, working in the military hospital of Constantine, Algeria, observed pigmented parasites inside the red blood cells of malaria sufferers. He witnessed the events of exflagellation and became convinced that the moving flagella were parasitic microorganisms. He noted that quinine removed the parasites from the blood. Laveran called this microscopic organism Oscillaria malariae and proposed that malaria was caused by this protozoan. This discovery remained controversial until the development of the oil immersion lens in 1884 and of superior staining methods in 1890–1891.|$|E
5|$|Mercury {{occurs in}} {{deposits}} {{throughout the world}} mostly as cinnabar (mercuric sulfide). The red <b>pigment</b> vermilion is obtained by grinding natural cinnabar or synthetic mercuric sulfide.|$|E
30|$|The {{intracellular}} <b>pigments</b> {{are mainly}} {{composed of two}} yellow <b>pigments</b> (monascin and ankaflavin) and two orange <b>pigments</b> (monascorubrin and rubropunctation) (Additional file 2 : Figure S 1), as demonstrated by our previous study (Huang et al. 2017). The yield of intracellular <b>pigments</b> was also strongly inhibited at 25  °C. Optimal temperature for the production of intracellular yellow <b>pigments</b> was 35  °C (Additional file 3 : Figure S 2), of which the final yield of the intracellular yellow <b>pigments</b> increased approximately 1.8 times of that at 25  °C, reaching up to 190 AU 410.|$|R
40|$|Objective: Differential {{diagnosis}} of vulvar <b>pigmented</b> lesions includes many benign lesions {{as well as}} malignant neoplasias such as melanoma.

5|$|Pigments {{responsible}} for the orange to red colors of the mature fruit bodies {{have been identified as}} carotenes, predominantly lycopene and beta-carotene—the same compounds {{responsible for}} the red and orange colors of tomatoes and carrots, respectively. Lycopene is also the main <b>pigment</b> in the closely related fungus Clathrus archeri, while beta-carotene is the predominant <b>pigment</b> in the Phallaceae species Mutinus caninus, M.ravenelii, and M.elegans.|$|E
5|$|Ruthenium tetroxide exposes latent {{fingerprints}} by reacting on {{contact with}} fatty oils or fats with sebaceous contaminants and producing brown/black ruthenium dioxide <b>pigment.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sclerocitrin, a <b>pigment</b> {{compound}} originally {{isolated from}} the common earthball (Scleroderma citrinum), is the major contributor to the yellow colour of the mycelium and the stipe base of C.piperatus fruit bodies. Other compounds that have been isolated from this species include norbadioneA, chalciporone, xerocomic acid, variegatic acid, variegatorubin, and another yellow <b>pigment,</b> chalcitrin. Chalciporone {{is responsible for the}} bitter taste of the fruit bodies. The pigments sclerocitrin, chalcitrin, and norbadioneA are derived biosynthetically from xerocomic acid. Related compounds found in the fruit bodies include the chalciporone isomers isochalciporone and dehydroisochalciporone.|$|E
50|$|Gel inks usually contain <b>pigments,</b> while liquid inks {{are limited}} to dyestuffs, as <b>pigments</b> will sink down in liquid ink (sedimentation). The {{thickness}} and suspending power of gels allows the use of <b>pigments</b> in gelled ink, which yields {{a greater variety of}} brighter colors than is possible in liquid ink. Gels also allow for the use of heavier <b>pigments</b> with metallic or glitter effects, or opaque pastel <b>pigments</b> that can be seen on dark surfaces.|$|R
50|$|Some of the <b>pigments</b> used by medieval painters, such as {{cinnabar}} (contains mercury), orpiment (contains arsenic), or lead white (contains lead) {{are highly}} toxic. Most artists today use modern synthetic <b>pigments,</b> which are less toxic but have similar color properties {{to the older}} <b>pigments.</b> Even so, many (if not most) modern <b>pigments</b> are still dangerous unless certain precautions are taken; these include keeping <b>pigments</b> wet in storage to avoid breathing their dust.|$|R
