40|$|This Article {{presents}} an analysis and {{defense of the}} Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s current Eighth Amendment case law on prison sentencing. I argue that in the pivotal cases of Ewing v.

I defend this doctrine on the grounds of original understanding, stare decisis, neutral interpretation, and normative federalism values. Finally, I show how an interpretation of Eighth Amendment prison sentencing review as rationality review can be squared with the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s decisions involving constitutional proportionality review of other noncapital sanctions such as fines, punitive damages, and conditions of confinement...|$|E

40|$|I. Abstract The aim of {{the thesis}} is to {{describe}} the issue of enforcement claims under execution for monetary compensation according to the Executory Code and judicial enforcement of decision under Part Six of the Civil Procedure Code. Consensus for judicial enforcement and execution, which is largely based on the regulation of judicial enforcement of decision, as the Executory Code is special to the Civil Procedure Code, made the author realize clearer interpretation of individual topics {{from the point of}} view of judicial enforcement of decision and parallelly from the view of judicial execution. Executory title is essential requirement for judicial enforcement of decision or writ of execution. However, it is not the only one prerequisite. There are other assumptions, which are requirement to the writ of enforcement and successful completion of the execution or judicial enforcement. Other essential attributes, that need to be examined, are perfection of proposal, active legitimation of the claimant, passive legitimation of the debtor, their eligibility, litispendentio or rei iudicatae etc. The absence of even only one of the conditions proceeding is a <b>procedural</b> <b>defect.</b> Execution proceedings and judicial enforcement consist of several phases.

40|$|This article {{confirms}} {{the existence of}} these legal process-centric themes and considers some potential implications of these approaches. Part I briefly sets out key tenets of the legal process vision and provides some back- ground to the American Innocence Movement. Using examples from relevant case law, Part II examines the courts’ approaches thematically, demonstrating how the courts exhibit loyalty to the legal process vision. It also considers the implications of this loyalty, including that it can result in both the extraction of science from its social context and an awkward approach towards discerning between credible and incredible forensic science evidence of individualization, as well as represent a failure, by the courts, to acknowledge the corrective justice function afforded to clemency by the common law. Part III concludes that these approaches to judicial decision-making ultimately fail to accept the way in which new and credible evidence – particularly forensic science evidence – can cast legitimate doubt on the verdict of a trial or, indeed, impact the proceedings of a clemency board, “quite apart from any <b>procedural</b> <b>defect.</b> ” In light of the American Innocence Movement, the courts’ largely unreserved fidelity to the legal process vision, in the context explored, is troublesome, and warrants new approaches that are more sensitive to substantive accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Para o desenvolvimento do tema, analisou-se a possibilidade de fixação de um conceito geral de invalidades, aplicável a todos os ramos do Direito. Tratou-se das especificidades das invalidades processuais, bem como de seu conceito e abrangência. Os principais critérios doutrinários para sistematização dos vícios dos atos processuais foram examinados como método auxiliar da elaboração da proposta de sistematização que compõe o objeto do presente estudo. A teoria das invalidades sofreu o impacto da acertada preocupação de que o processo não deve servir a seus próprios fins. Firmada essa concepção, nota-se uma dedicação à tarefa de realçar os limites deste aspecto instrumental, de modo a questionar a possibilidade de o exame da irrelevância do vício processual se dar pelo enfoque exclusivo de critérios exteriores à relação jurídica processual. Atualmente, a cláusula do devido processo legal incorpora a axiologia das garantias fundamentais do indivíduo, explicitando que são indispensáveis as garantias inerentes ao processo. A resolução da crise de direito {{material}} deve lançar efeitos sobre os vícios que acarretem transgressão de tais garantias, mas uma teoria das invalidades deve estar sustentada nos referenciais processuais, não podendo condicionar-se, exclusivamente, ao resultado final do processo, {{dado que}} lhe é externo. Assim, o enfoque classificatório adotado para sistematização dos vícios da sentença civil procura assentar-se sobre as regras e princípios do processo, notadamente porque se reconhece que o respeito ao direito material e ao direito processual equiparam-se em importância para que se obtenha uma decisão justa. A inexistência da sentença foi examinada sob os aspectos da decisão proferida em processo juridicamente inexistente ou pela ausência de seus elementos intrínsecos. Ao final, examinou-se a casuística relativa à sentença inválida, como aquela dada em processo com irregular constituição do juiz ou com defeito de fundamentação. Aiming {{to develop the}} theme, the analysis {{on the possibility of}} setting a general concept of invalidities, applicable to all the areas of Law was analyzed. The specificities, concept and scope of procedural invalidities were addressed. The main juristic criteria used to systematize the defects of procedural acts were analyzed as an auxiliary method for preparing the systematization proposal that comprises the subject matter of this study. The theory of invalidities was impacted by the appropriate concern about the procedure not being used as means to suit its own purpose. After establishing this concept, there is the focus on underlining the limits of this instrumental aspect to question whether the possibility of the analysis on the irrelevance of the <b>procedural</b> <b>defect</b> is focused solely on criteria that is external to the procedural legal relationship. Currently, the section of the due process of law incorporates the axiology of individual fundamental guarantees, making explicit that the guarantees inherent to the procedure are fundamental. The solution for the crisis of substantive law should impact the defects that lead to the violation of such guarantees. However, the theory of invalidities should be grounded on procedural references, and not be exclusively dependent on the final result of the process, since such theory is external to it. Accordingly, the focus on classification adopted to systematize the defects of the civil judgment intends to have as base the rules and principles of the process, since it is known that the respect toward substantive law and procedural law are of equal importance in reaching a just decision. The inexistence of the judgment was reviewed based on the aspects of the decision granted in a process that does not exist in legal terms or by the absence of its intrinsic elements. Finally, there was the analysis of case histories related to the invalid judgment, such as the judgment of a procedure with irregular constitution of the court or with defect of reasons...|$|E

40|$|It is {{not unusual}} for a Delaware corporation’s stock records to have {{omissions}} or <b>procedural</b> <b>defects</b> raising questions as to the valid authorization of some of the outstanding stock. Confronted with such irregularities, most corporate lawyers would likely attempt to cure the defect through board and, if necessary, stockholder ratification. However, in a number of leading cases, the Delaware Supreme Court has treated the statutory formalities for the issuance of stock as substantive prerequisites to the validity of the stock being issued, and the court has determined that failure to comply with such formalities renders the stock in question void, i. e., not curable by ratification. Unfortunately, the decisions issued by the Delaware courts have not afforded the necessary certainty to allow practitioners to decide whether a particular defect in stock issuance is a substantive defect that renders stock void or a mere technical defect that renders stock voidable. This Article analyzes the cases giving rise to this lack of clarity and proposes that the Delaware courts apply the policy underlying Article 8 of the Delaware Uniform Commercial Code to validate stock in the hands of innocent purchasers for value in determining whether stock is void or voidable...|$|R
40|$|The {{moral and}} social norms that bear on {{contracts}} of adhesion suggest a deep ambivalence. Contracts {{are perceived as}} serious moral obligations, and yet they must be taken lightly or everyday commerce would be impossible. Most people see consent to boilerplate as less meaningful than consent to negotiated terms, but they nonetheless would hold consumers strictly liable for both. This Essay aims to unpack the beliefs, preferences, assumptions, and biases that constitute our assessments of assent to boilerplate. Research suggests that misgivings about <b>procedural</b> <b>defects</b> in consumer contracting weigh heavily on judgments of contract formation, but play almost no role in judgments of blame for transactional harms. Using experimental methods from the psychology of judgment and decision-making, I test the psychological explanations for this disjunction, including motivated reasoning and reliance on availability heuristics. Many commentators have argued that {{even though it is}} true that disclosures are probably ineffective, they “can’t hurt. ” I conclude with a challenge to that proposition—I argue that the can’t-hurt attitude may lead to overuse of disclosures that do not affect consumer decision-making, but have implicit effects on the moral calculus of transactional harms...|$|R
40|$|The {{mortgage}} foreclosure process is beset {{by a variety}} of problems. These range from <b>procedural</b> <b>defects</b> (including, but not limited to robosigning) to outright counterfeiting of documents to questions about the validity of private-label mortgage securitizations that could mean that these mortgage-backed securities are not actually backed by any mortgages whatsoever. While the extent of these problems is unknown at present, the evidence is mounting that it is not limited to one-off cases, but that there may be pervasive defects throughout the foreclosure and securitization processes. The problems in the mortgage market are highly technical, but they are extremely serious. At best they present problems of fraud on the court, clouded title to property, and delay in foreclosures that will increase the shadow housing inventory and drive down home prices. At worst, they represent a systemic risk of liabilities in the trillions of dollars, greatly exceeding the capital of the US’s major financial institutions.

40|$|This work {{examines}} exploitation {{as a moral}} wrong, {{with the}} specific goal of explaining how one party might wrong another in an interaction that is {{to the benefit of}} both and fully consensual. This form of exploitation is interesting in that it involves neither harm nor certain <b>procedural</b> <b>defects,</b> such as coercion or deceit. I propose that exploitation – at least in some contexts (especially employment) and with few exceptions – occurs when one party (A) uses another (B) to attain what is needed to live a decent life while B is not given such an amount. A’s use of B in this way is a significant failure of respect, meaning A wrongs B despite the fact that their interaction improves B’s overall condition. I examine several contemporary theories of exploitation, finding none of them completely satisfying. I argue that some accounts fail to track the right kinds of considerations (including, in some situations, need). Other accounts fail to explain how the alleged exploiter could be obligated to interact on specific, non-exploitative terms with the allegedly exploited. Moreover, all these accounts share an approach to exploitation that can exonerate potential exploiters for the wrong reasons. After proposing some basic desiderata for a good theory, I offer my own account of exploitation and defend it from important potential objections, including the claim that it is overly restrictive because it will prevent interactions which would otherwise be of significant benefit to individuals in need. I conclude by discussing some connections between exploitation and structural injustice...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate canal preparations using a sequential silicone impression technique to assess root canal morphology. Methods: Pre-operative canal impressions were obtained from 24 extracted single-rooted premolars. Canals were randomly assigned to be firstly, instrumented with stainless steel K-type files or rotary nickel-titanium instruments (Profile), then further apically enlarged with rotary nickel-titanium instruments (Profile or Lightspeed). Post instrumen-tation impressions were taken and digitally photographed in a bucco-lingual and mesio-distal orientation at low-power magnification. Images were evaluated for <b>procedural</b> <b>defects,</b> changes in canal curvature, canal enlargement and canal rounding at 1, 3 and 7 mm from the working length. Results: Silicone impressions could accurately reproduce the detailed root canal morphology of single-canal premolars. Repeated impressions of each canal using a standardized procedure allowed a detailed {{comparison of}} instrumentation techniques at various stages. Hand instrumentation incurred more errors than rotary nickel-titanium instrumentation (Profile). Further apical enlargement using Lightspeed instruments incurred fewer errors than with Profile instruments. Differences among techniques were highly significant (p< 0. 005). All techniques resulted in slight canal straightening, as well as rounder and enlarged canals particularly in the apical third. Conclusions: Rotary nickel-titanium instrumentation, especially Lightspeed, may produce better canal shape by reducing procedural errors. Key words: Rotary nickel-titanium, root canal preparation, silicone impressions, procedural errors. (Accepted for publication October 2000. ...|$|R
