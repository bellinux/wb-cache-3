There are substantial numbers of researches on mobile applications that have contributed to business development. This research is aimed at investigating the factors influencing individuals' purchase of mobile application. An exploratory study has been conducted to gain understanding of Malaysian's perspective on mobile application purchase intention. Unstructured interviews were conducted among 19 research participants randomly selected from different background. The results show that perceived usefulness, facilitating condition, perceived value, perceived enjoyment, perceived fee, electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM), application design in terms of features and visual, trust, security, <b>privacy,</b> <b>device</b> compatibility and device consumption in terms of power and memory relate to individual's intention to purchase mobile application...|$|E
40|$|In digital {{beamforming}} receivers {{the tracking}} of satellite signals {{which have a}} similar direction of arrival like the interference source often lose lock. A very difficult and time consuming reacquisition is the consequence. Especially in scenarios with moving receivers or RFI sources, gradually all satellites might get lost due to the change of the directions of arrival between the satellite signals and the RFI source. In single antenna receivers a very similar effect {{can be observed in}} urban canyons. According to the movement of the receiver different parts in the receiver’s skyplot are obstructed due to buildings or other obstacles. Vector tracking is a well-known technique to improve the GNSS availability in such scenarios. This paper describes an approach to integrate a vector delay and frequency locked loop (VDFLL) in a digital beamforming receiver. The proposed architecture consists of a pre-correlation prewhitening module and a VDFLL with an integrated post-correlation eigenbeamformer. The architecture of this approach will be described in detail and the potential capabilities will be shown by the results of a measurement campaign with a personal <b>privacy</b> <b>device</b> jammer...|$|E
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / November 19 - 21, 1979 / Town and Country Hotel, San Diego, CaliforniaAnalog {{voice privacy}} {{techniques}} provide {{the advantage of}} being compatible with the 3 kHz audio bandwidth of the existing radio and telephone channels. The degree of privacy provided by an analog voice scrambling technique, however, is proportional to the number of time and frequency elements into which the voice signal can be divided {{as well as to the}} number of permutation patterns according to which the elements are scrambled. This implies the requirement for a high degree of signal-processing capability. Microprocessorbased implementations of an analog voice scrambling device provide a large potential for signal processing and scrambling. Furthermore, they provide this potential at a reasonable cost, small volume and moderate power consumption. In addition, a single microprocessorbased analog voice <b>privacy</b> <b>device</b> can be configured in software to yield various degrees of privacy, depending on a particular use and circumstances. Also, a variety of auxiliary functions such as timing, code generation, synchronization and analog-to-digital conversion can be time-shared within the same microprocessor chip, thus minimizing the requirement for support hardware. The purpose of this paper is twofold: (1) to provide an overview of the existing analog voice privacy techniques, and (2) to specifically outline the capabilities of the microprocessor-based analog voice privacy system design, with a particular emphasis on achieving an analog scrambled signal compatible with the 3 kHz nominal audio bandwidth of the existing radio and telephone channels. Also, workable algorithms used for microprocessor-based analog voice scrambling in frequency as well as in time domain are described. Tape recordings of the voice scrambled and recovered with these algorithms are presented for comparison...|$|E

40|$|RF {{interference}} (RFI) {{has been}} {{and will continue to}} be a significant worry for GNSS users. This paper introduces several different types of RFI, categorizes them based upon the intent (if any) of the RFI transmitter, and then examines a relatively new and growing source of RFI: Personal <b>Privacy</b> <b>Devices</b> (PPDs) that aim to prevent people and vehicles from being tracked by GNSS within a limited area. Unfortunately, signals from PPDs are not well-controlled and can interfere with GNSS receivers several hundred meters away. The impact of PPDs on the GBAS reference station site at Newark Airport, New Jersey and the WAAS reference station at Leesburg, Virginia are illustrated. While GBAS ground station monitoring prevents PPDs from posing a significant integrity threat, PPDs can force the sudden loss of service and thus harm continuity and availability. The hardware and software modifications made to the Newark GBAS installation to reduce this impact are described, and the future benefits of more-flexible ground-station siting and GNSS modernization are also identified...|$|R

Specifically, against multipath and {{radio frequency interference}} (RFI), such as continuous wave (CW), personal <b>privacy</b> <b>devices</b> (PPD) and additive white gaussian noise (AWGN) interferers, we developed a two-stage mitigation algorithm. It consists of a prewhitening approach, followed by a space-time adaptive Principle Component Analysis (PCA) beamformer that uses a compression method based on Canonical Components (CC) with a bank of signal matched correlators. The proposed algorithms are capable of suppressing strong RFI and separating highly correlated and even coherent multipath signals, thus achieving improved time-delay and pseudorange estimation performance for safety-critical applications. Furthermore, an additional algorithm has been developed to detect spoofing attacks. The derived scheme fuses the direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation of the satellites in view with positioning information and produces a measure {{of confidence in the}} case of such an attack. Finally, we evaluate and compare the algorithms in question with real data collected in a measurement campaign performed at DLR's maritime jamming testbed in the Baltic sea...|$|R

40|$|In {{ubiquitous}} computing environments, distributed services hosted by electronic devices can be composed into ap- plications using external service orchestration. This paper presents a context-aware resource management approach for service oriented applications, {{which aims to}} handle the inherent dynamics of services and the network, and to provide end-to-end Quality-of-Service (QoS) in a secure way. To maintain <b>privacy,</b> <b>devices</b> and services are organized in virtual communities. Only authenticated users can access them. To cope with dynamics of services and the network, a cross-layer monitoring architecture is designed to gather dynamic resource utilization of the services. Accordingly, service coordination decisions {{can be adapted to}} provide desired QoS. Two novel services are designed. One is a device manager which runs on each device and has full control of services and their underlying resources. Another is a resource manager which anticipates the performance of both required services and the network through monitoring the QoS in diverse layers and also be aware of environment changes. A prototyping system VICSDA and a 3 D video streaming application are built to prove the feasibility of this approach. Concrete results showed that VICSDA is context-aware and can optimize the overall performance of service oriented applications in a secure way.

40|$|Personal <b>privacy</b> <b>devices</b> (PPDs) are {{low-cost}} jammers to mask GPS signals, so {{that the}} location of the host vehicle is not revealed to other parties. Although it is illegal to use PPDs in the United States, they are being used and have caused problems for other GPS users. This paper investigates the PPD impact on aviation users from the WAAS service perspective. Although PPD jammers on the ground cannot reach airplanes far in the air, PPDs can interfere ground-based WAAS reference stations. We conducted Montel-Carlo simulation on WAAS availability coverage based on real data retrieved from current WAAS reference stations. Our simulation results show that PPD jamming activity has had negligible impact on WAAS service due to redundancy and robustness of large number of WAAS reference stations. Aviation users rely on Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) for accuracy and integrity. WAAS augments GPS by transmitting error correction messages calculated from 38 WAAS reference stations (WRS) on the ground [4]. Figure 2 illustrates WAAS system architecture. Although airplanes flying in the sky are far from the PPD jammers on the ground, PPDs can potentially deteriorate aviation performance by interfering the WAAS reference stations on the ground. It is currently unknown how close an aircraft has to be to a jammer to be impacted, but there is a risk that a PPD right under the approach path could cause a loss of service not modeled in this paper...|$|R

40|$|Model-based {{estimation}} {{techniques have}} been developed and applied to data collected from real Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) jammers. Lowpower civilian GNSS jammers pose a growing threat {{to the integrity of}} GNSS timing and navigation, and the present effort develops various countermeasures for these devices. The use of illegal civilian GNSS jammers has grown in recent years out of concern for personal privacy, sometimes on the part of innocents, but often in support of unauthorized or illegal activities. These civilian jammers are commonly referred to as personal <b>privacy</b> <b>devices</b> (PPDs). The effects of these PPDs are not limited to the individual user; they disrupt GNSSenabled equipment in a radius of 100 m- 1000 m or more around each device. GNSS systems are being further integrated into many aspects of our society; therefore, the rise in PPD use portends trouble for various pieces of civilian infrastructure. PPD use can be discouraged through more rigorous enforcement of spectrum interference laws. These enforcement actions will require specially designed equipment, and in particular, algorithms to be run by that equipment: algorithms that detect, acquire, track, and geolocate these PPDs. Six contributions are made to the body of knowledge on PPDs and the model-based algorithms related to PPD signal detection, acquisition, and tracking, and to PPD geolocation. However, many of these contributions can be generalized to additional non-PPD signals. The first contribution is a survey of the signal characteristics of 18 different. The second contribution is a sensible chirp-style signal model for the PPDs. The third contribution is a sensitive PPD chirp-style signal detection algorithm that has been extensively optimized for low computational burden. The fourth contribution is a two-part FFT-based signal acquisition procedure that can rapidly acquire a full state estimate of the target PPD using the data provided by the signal detection algorithm. The fifth contribution is a signal tracking Kalman filter for estimating the states of the received PPD signal.

However, private parties like Apple, may want to design their products in such a way that evading and breaking the security of the system is not possible, as consumers demand secure and <b>privacy</b> friendly <b>devices.</b> This article adds to this debate by posing DPbD as an argument in favor of private parties not to cooperate in making their products less secure and less privacy friendly.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{approach}} is to authenticate user’s mobiledevice and to preserve privacy towards location proof. A person’slocation proof depends on the user’s mobile device position. Biometric authentication technique was proposed in order toavoid malicious users from prevaricating their identity. Thelocation proofs are generated by co-located Bluetooth enabledmobile devices. The working of our proposed system is similar toPrivacy-Preserving Location proof Updating System(APPLAUS) [14]. To prevent the weak identity of mobile device,the technique of biometric authentication was deployed.

Hence the major necessity is to preserve the <b>privacy</b> ofeach <b>device</b> by using multiple pseudonyms.

40|$|Abstract. We examine covert {{channels}} in privacy-enhanced mobile identification devices where the devices uniquely identify themselves to an authorized verifier. Such devices (e. g. RFID tags) are increasingly commonplace {{in hospitals and}} many other environments. For <b>privacy,</b> the <b>device</b> outputs used for identification should “appear random ” to any entity other than the verifier, and should not allow physical tracking of device bearers. Worryingly, there already exist privacy breaches for some devices [28] that allow adversaries to physically track users. Ideally, such devices should allow anyone to publicly determine that the device outputs are covert-channel free (CCF); we say that such devices are CCF-checkable. Our main result shows {{that there is a}} fundamental tension between identifier privacy and CCFcheckability; we show that the two properties cannot co-exist in a single system. We also develop a weaker privacy model where a continuous observer can correlate appearances of a given tag, but a sporadic observer cannot. We also construct a privacy-preserving tag identification scheme that is CCF-checkable and prove it secure under the weaker privacy model using a new complexity assumption. The main challenge addressed in our construction is the enforcement of public verifiability, which allows a user to verify covert-channel-freeness in her device without managing secret keys external to the device. ...|$|R

Such jammers are used (illegally) as <b>privacy</b> protection <b>devices</b> or more seriously to defeat tracking systems in order to commit crime. The growing reliance on GNSS systems such as GPS (Global Positioning System) means that there is also potential for considerably more dire consequences.

In this paper we present a novel approach to source localisation based on a technique of radio fingerprinting. The key objective is to exploit knowledge of the radio propagation environment so as to determine the location of a radio source from as few measurements as possible. At the heart of the technique is the use of a ray-tracing model from which a database is generated containing propagation parameters such as received signal strength and angle of arrival as a function of source and receiver location. These are then used as constraints against which measured data can be inverted to yield the source location.
