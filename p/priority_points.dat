40|$|Abstract. The earliest-deadline-first (EDF) {{scheduling}} algorithm, {{while not}} optimal for globally-scheduled hard real-time systems, can support any feasible task system with bounded lateness. Furthermore, global-EDF-like (GEL) scheduling algorithms, which prioritize jobs by assigning them fixed <b>priority</b> <b>points</b> based on per-task relative <b>priority</b> <b>points,</b> {{have been shown}} to share this same property. Some such algorithms exhibit better lateness bounds than G-EDF. This paper surveys existing research on bounded-lateness analysis for GEL schedulers, and formulates one such analysis technique called compliant vector analysis (CVA) as a linear program (LP). Using this LP, per-task relative <b>priority</b> <b>points</b> can be set to optimize for application-specific lateness constraints, and minimize average and/or maximal lateness bounds. An empirical study is presented that compares the lateness bounds of a variety of GEL schedulers and analysis techniques on randomly generated task systems. ...|$|E

The aim {{of the present study}} was to revise the activity of the MELD Exception Experts Committee. MethodsBetween 2005 and 2009, 1623 patients were listed for LT. Regulation provides extra-MELD points for amyloidosis, hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) and T 2 hepatocellular carcinoma (T 2 HCC). Centres could also request priority for other situations. Using a prospective database, we identified patients in whom <b>priority</b> <b>points</b> were requested. Pathology reports of explanted livers were analysed for patients with T 2 HCC. ResultsFrom 234 out of 1623 (14. 4 %) requests, the overall approval rate was 60. 2 % including: 2 amyloidosis, 6 HPS, 111 T 2 HCC and 22 non-regulated situations. Of the 111 patients with T 2 HCC, 6 died (5. 4 %), 8 had tumour progression (7. 2 %), 94 were transplanted (84. 2 %) and 3 are still waiting. An explants correlation showed that presumed diagnosis of T 2 HCC was incorrect in 20 / 94 (22 %) and was correct in only 41 / 94 (43 %) cases being T 1 HCC in 9 and T 3 HCC in 23.

40|$|International audienceObjective The {{incidence}} of chronic diseases regularly increases thus focusing {{quality of care}} as a priority in chronically illness. In 2014, prescription renewal was the first reason of outpatient visit in French general practice. In fact, the follow-up of chronic disease may be somewhat longer and more complex than other standard cares. This work aimed to explore patients’ preferences with regard to prescription renewal and its variation {{according to their own}} illness profiles. Methods Between June and July 2014, patient perceptions were collected through a self-administered questionnaire addressed to adults from 14  French GPs offices. Results In one month, 307  questionnaires were returned. More than two-third patients (69. 7 %) evaluated the physician intervention as important as for another reason. The prescription was essential or very important for 70 %. <b>Priority</b> <b>points</b> were those related to share therapeutic options with the physician and to obtain more information on their own illness. Older were more seeking for information on symptoms and disease than younger (OR =  1. 14 [1. 03 – 1. 23]). Conclusion Patients are dealing with their own monitoring of chronic diseases. They expect more information and they look for shared decisions. The term “renewal” does not match their expectations thus leading against patient preference: we advocate substituting it to “prescription revaluation”. © 2016 Société française de pharmacologie et de thérapeutiqu...|$|E

MethodsBetween January 2000 and September 2009, 1010 patients with HCC were evaluated at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). Retrospectively, four treatment groups were classified: no treatment (NT), systemic therapy (ST), hepatic artery-based therapy (HAT) and surgical intervention (SI) including radiofrequency ablation, hepatic resection and transplantation. Kaplan–Meier analysis assessed survival between groups. Cox regression analysis identified factors predicting survival. ResultsPatients evaluated were 75 % male, 87 % Caucasian, 84 % cirrhotic, and predominantly diagnosed with hepatitis C. In all, 169 patients (16. 5 %) received NT, 25 (2. 4 %) received ST, 529 (51. 6 %) received HAT and 302 (29. 5 %) received SI. Median survival was 3. 6, 5. 6, 8. 8, and 83. 5 months with NT, ST, HAT and SI, respectively (P= 0. 001). Transplantation increased from 9. 5 % to 14. 2 % after the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) criteria granted HCC patients <b>priority</b> <b>points.</b> Survival was unaffected by bridging transplantation with HAT or SI (P= 0. 111).

40|$|Prior {{research}} {{has suggested that}} the allocation of scarce National Airspace System capacity could be improved if aircraft operators were able to exchange the priority in which their flights will be handled by the air traffic control system to reflect how much they value timeliness for specific aircraft flights. The current priority allocation system is based on a first-come first-served mechanism. FAA and users have made some modifications to first-come first-served to give operators more control over the priority in which their own flights get served through Collaborative Decision-Making. There are also programs which allow a carrier to give up a flight time slot that it will not use without having to go to the “end of the line, ” which is called slot credit substitution. Significant {{research has}} been done into ways to further improve demand-capacity balance in the National Airspace System while taking users ’ flight priorities into account. Many researchers have proposed market-based allocation systems, which are used when airport slots are bought and sold. Other researchers propose quasi-market systems that could be developed using a points system. This paper illustrates how the initial allocation of <b>priority</b> <b>points</b> among carriers influences how they use these points in establishing the priority for their flights to reduce their delays. The paper then reports the results from the human-in-the-loop simulation of aircraft operators’ decisions that show how the delay reduction differences for each operator vary among the different methods used to allocate the points. In general, the paper finds that a system which uses the number of flights in the allocation tends to benefit operators of smaller aircraft, while systems that use passengers and distance in the allocation favor operators of larger aircraft.

40|$|Background To {{optimize}} positive outcomes, {{the design}} of new pharmacy services should consider the preferences of consumers with chronic condition(s) and their carers. Objectives (i) To evaluate {{the relative importance of}} community pharmacy service characteristics, from the perspective of consumers with chronic condition(s) and carers; (ii) To compare consumer and carer preferences to health professional beliefs about ideal service characteristics for consumers. Method A discrete choice experiment was completed by consumers with chronic condition(s) and/or carers (n = 602) and health professionals (n = 297), recruited from four regions in Australia. Participants were each randomized to one survey version containing four (from a total 72) different choices between two new pharmacy services. Consumer and carer participants were also given an ‘opt out’ alternative of current service. Each service was described using six attributes related to pharmacy service characteristics: continued medicines supply, continuity and coordinated care, location, medication management, education and information, and cost. Results Consumers and carers placed highest priority on continued medicines supply by a pharmacist for regular and symptom flare up medicines (100 <b>priority</b> <b>points),</b> a pharmacy located within a ‘one-stop’ health center (61 points) and home delivery of medicines (52 points). Although continued medicines supply was most important for consumers and carers, pharmacy location was perceived by health professionals {{to be the most important}} characteristic for consumers. Participants were less inclined to choose new services if their current pharmacy offered high quality services that were person-centered, easy to access and responsive to their needs. Younger, more highly educated and employed participants, and those with established condition(s) were more likely to choose new services. Conclusions Person-centered care is a fundamental tenet for pharmacy services. The provision of continued medicines supply (e. g. through pharmacist prescribing), convenient and coordinated care delivered through a one stop health centre, and home delivery of medicines, should be prioritized when planning pharmacy services to best assist consumers to manage chronic conditions...|$|E
