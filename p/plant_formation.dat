Other attractions along this route include Comitán de Domínguez and Chiapa de Corzo, along with small indigenous communities such as San Juan Chamula. The state capital of Tuxtla Gutiérrez does not have many colonial era structures left, but it lies near the area's most famous natural attraction of the Sumidero Canyon. This canyon is popular with tourists who take boat tours into it on the Grijalva River to see such features such as caves (La Cueva del Hombre, La Cueva del Silencio) and the Christmas Tree, which is a rock and <b>plant</b> <b>formation</b> on the side of one of the canyon walls created by a seasonal waterfall.|$|E

5000|$|OrganismsLarge {{plants are}} only part of the organisms that play a role in soil formation. For example, fungi are closely {{associated}} with the roots of many vascular plants by making available nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus in a way that their host plants can utilize, and play an important role in returning organic matter to the soil by decomposing leaf litter. The list of organisms that interact with, and affect, soil is extensive, and it is these interactions that allow for the presence of paleosols to be inferred. Not only can particular organisms be interpreted from paleosols, but also ancient ecosystems. The soil interaction of plants is different from community to community. They each have distinct patterns of root traces, soil structure, and overall profile form. Identifying these features is useful for providing an overall assessment of the influence past organisms had on any particular paleosol. However, qualifying these general effects of organism activity can be difficult because the level of their expression is as related to their nature as it is to the amount of time available for soil formation. Even when fossils that are found in paleosols are understood, much more can be learned regarding their preservation, ecology, and evolution by studying the paleosols they inhabited. [...] A fossilized footprint, burrow, or coprolite (fossil feces), are examples of trace fossils (ichnofossils). These trace fossils do not represent any physical part of an organism, but rather evidence of an organism's activity within its environment. Whereas a bone, leaf, or stem might provide enough information to positively identify a particular species, trace fossils rarely allow for such a precise identification. However, unlike fossilized body parts which can be affected by many variables, trace fossils are not often transported away and are usually found in the place where the organism lived. This advantage makes trace fossils in paleosols especially important because they allow for interpretation of the animal's behavior in its natural environment. A great example of this is the simple shallow fossilized burrows of solitary bees that make their homes in soil. Just as fossilized footprints, burrows, and coprolites represent trace fossils or organisms, paleosols can be considered trace fossils of an ancient ecosystem. Much like the small percentage of species that are fossilized, very few species within an ecosystem leave any discernible trace in paleosols. However, their more general effects within a paleosol may be preserved. A good example of this is root traces. Analyzing the pattern of root traces, the sequence of soil horizons, and other features can help identify the type of vegetation that was present during the formation of the soil. General features such as stature and spacing determine what botanists call a 'plant formation.' Distinct from a community or association, <b>plant</b> <b>formation</b> is not defined by any particular species. Examples of <b>plant</b> <b>formation</b> include forests, woodlands, and grasslands. Because it may not be possible to determine whether a particular plant was an oak, eucalyptus, or other species, plant formations in paleosols make it possible to identify an ancient woodland ecosystem from an ancient grassland ecosystem.

40|$|Soil {{microorganisms}} {{play key}} roles in ecosystem functioning and {{are known to}} be influenced by biotic and abiotic factors, such as plant cover or edaphic parameters. New Caledonia, a biodiversity hotspot located in the southwest Pacific, is one-third covered by ultramafic substrates. These types of soils are notably characterised by low nutrient content and high heavy metal concentrations. Ultramafic outcrops harbour diverse vegetation types and remarkable plant diversity. In this study, we aimed to assess soil bacterial and fungal diversity in New Caledonian ultramafic substrates and to determine whether floristic composition, edaphic parameters and geographical factors affect this microbial diversity. Therefore, four <b>plant</b> <b>formation</b> types at two distinct sites were studied. These formations represent different stages in a potential chronosequence. Soil cores, according to a given sampling procedure, were collected to assess microbial diversity using a metagenomic approach, and to characterise the physico-chemical parameters. A botanical inventory was also performed. Our results indicated that microbial richness, composition and abundance were linked to the plant cover type and the dominant plant species. Furthermore, a large proportion of Ascomycota phylum (fungi), mostly in non-rainforest formations, and Planctomycetes phylum (bacteria) in all formations were observed. Interestingly, such patterns could be indicators of past disturbances that occurred on different time scales. Furthermore, the bacteria and fungi were influenced by diverse edaphic parameters {{as well as by the}} interplay between these two soil communities. Another striking finding was the existence of a site effect. Differences in microbial communities between geographical locations may be explained by dispersal limitation in the context of the biogeographical island theory. In conclusion, each <b>plant</b> <b>formation</b> at each site possesses is own microbial community resulting from multiple interactions between abiotic and biotic factors. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

We assessed the variations in species composition and the different vegetation types in the municipalities of Rio de Janeiro. Data were collected primarily through surveys of museums and publication lists of species. We also conducted field sampling in March and September 2010. Of the 2, 077 records covering 28 municipalities, 679 Arctiinae species were found in Rio de Janeiro state and {{were divided into two}} tribes and 220 genera. The location with the highest number of species recorded was Itatiaia, with 362 species, followed by Petrópolis and Angra dos Reis, with 320 and 306 species, respectively. Thirty-four percent (n = 230) of the species recorded were exclusive, i. e., occurred in only one location. The lowest dissimilarity values were observed between neighboring municipalities with the same type of <b>plant</b> <b>formation,</b> such as Petrópolis and Teresópolis (19 %) or Itatiaia and Resende (24 %). Some municipalities slightly further apart geographically, but with the same type of <b>plant</b> <b>formation,</b> also showed low levels of dissimilarity, for example, Petropolis and Resende (29 %). However, most locations showed intermediate dissimilarity values of 40 - 60 %, and in some cases, this figure rose to 96 %. In the state of Rio de Janeiro, irrespective of its small geographical size and the predominance of a unique ecosystem, the Atlantic Forest shows a wide variation in relief, which may explain the high beta diversity values. Despite the large number of Arctiinae species recorded in Rio de Janeiro, few species were identified in areas with important forest remnants, such as Guapimirim, Nova Iguaçu, and Campos dos Goitacazes.
