25|$|Chapters of The Second Sex were {{originally}} published in Les Temps modernes, in June 1949. The second volume came {{a few months after}} the first in France. It was very quickly published in America due to the quick translation by Howard Parshley, as prompted by Blanche Knopf, wife of publisher Alfred A. Knopf. Because Parshley had only a basic familiarity with the French language, and a minimal understanding of philosophy (he was a <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>biology</b> <b>at</b> Smith College), much of de Beauvoir's book was mistranslated or inappropriately cut, distorting her intended message. For years, Knopf prevented the introduction of a more accurate retranslation of de Beauvoir's work, declining all proposals despite the efforts of existentialist scholars. Only in 2009 was there a second translation, to mark the 60th anniversary of the original publication. Constance Borde and Sheila Malovany-Chevallier produced the first integral translation in 2010, reinstating a third of the original work.|$|E

500|$|Another charge {{leveled at}} {{evolutionary}} theory by creationists is that belief in evolution is either tantamount to atheism, or conducive to atheism. It is commonly claimed that all proponents of evolutionary theory are [...] "materialistic atheists." [...] On the other hand, Davis A. Young argues that creation science itself is harmful to Christianity because its bad science will turn more away than it recruits. Young asks, [...] "Can we seriously expect non-Christians {{to develop a}} respect for Christianity if we insist on teaching the brand of science that creationism brings with it?" [...] However, evolution neither requires nor rules out {{the existence of a}} supernatural being. Philosopher Robert T. Pennock makes the comparison that evolution is no more atheistic than plumbing. H. Allen Orr, <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>biology</b> <b>at</b> University of Rochester, notes that: ...|$|E
500|$|In 1958, the {{director}} of The New York Botanical Garden, William Jacob Robbins, recruited Rogerson for the position of Curator of Cryptogamic Botany. Rogerson became Senior Curator in 1967 and Senior Curator Emeritus at his retirement in 1990. As curator of cryptogamic botany, Rogerson [...] "was directly responsible for all accessions and loans of ferns and mosses, {{as well as of}} fungi and lichens, until about 1965 when, first a bryologist and later a pteridologist were added to the cryptogamic staff." [...] At the Garden, he also continued his study on the taxonomy of the Ascomycetes, especially of Hypomyces, a genus of fungi that parasitize other fungi, and the fungal diversity of New York and Utah. Additionally, he served as editor of the Garden's publications: Memoirs of the New York Botanical Garden (1963–88), North American Flora (1963–88), and Flora Neotropica (1969–83). While at the Garden, Rogerson was also an adjunct <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>biology</b> <b>at</b> Columbia University and at the Herbert H. Lehman College of the City University of New York.|$|E
500|$|At {{least five}} {{species have been}} given {{scientific}} names honoring Colbert. In 2008 a species of California trapdoor spider was named Aptostichus stephencolberti. The spider was named for Colbert after he reported on his television series that Jason Bond, a <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>biology</b> <b>at</b> East Carolina University, had named a different species of spider Myrmekiaphila neilyoungi after the Canadian rock star Neil Young, and began to appeal for a species of animal to be named after him. On a later edition of The Colbert Report, Colbert revealed that Bond would name a spider after him, with Colbert claiming, [...] "And all I {{had to do was}} shamelessly beg on national television." [...] Other species named for Colbert include a species of Venezuelan diving beetle named Agaporomorphus colberti and a Chilean stonefly named Diamphipnoa colberti, both formally described in 2008. On his 45th birthday, Colbert was sent a framed print of his eponymous beetle by the biologists who named it. In 2014, a species of parasitic wasp from Ecuador, Aleiodes colberti, was named for Colbert, along with newly described species named for celebrities Jon Stewart, Jimmy Fallon, Ellen DeGeneres, and Shakira, and in 2016 a rove beetle, Sonoma colberti, was named after Colbert's on-screen persona.|$|E
