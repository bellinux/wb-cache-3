40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to record growth-related changes in {{collagen}} network organization and proteoglycan distribution in intermittently <b>peak-loaded</b> and continuously lower-level-loaded articular cartilage. Cartilage from the proximal phalangeal bone of the equine metacarpophalangeal joint at birth, at 5, 11 and 18 months, and at 6 – 10 years of age was collected from two sites. Site 1, at the joint margin, is unloaded at slow gaits but is subjected to high-intensity loading during athletic activity; site 2 is a continuously but less intensively loaded site in the centre of the joint. The degree of collagen parallelism was determined with quantitative polarized light microscopy and the parallelism index for collagen fibrils was computed from the cartilage surface to the osteochondral junction. Concurrent changes in the proteoglycan distribution were quantified with digital densitometry. We found that the parallelism index increased significantly with age (up to 90 %). At birth, site 2 exhibited a more organized collagen network than site 1. In adult horses this situation was reversed. The superficial and intermediate zones exhibited the greatest reorganization of collagen. Site 1 had a higher proteoglycan content than site 2 at birth but here too the situation was reversed in adult horses. We conclude that large changes in joint loading during growth and maturation in the period from birth to adulthood profoundly affect the architecture of the collagen network in equine cartilage. In addition, the distribution and content of proteoglycans are modified significantly by altered joint use. Intermittent <b>peak-loading</b> with shear seems to induce higher collagen parallelism and a lower proteoglycan content in cartilage than more constant weight-bearing. Therefore, we hypothesize that the formation of mature articular cartilage with a highly parallel collagen network and relatively low proteoglycan content in the <b>peak-loaded</b> area of a joint is needed to withstand intermittent stress and shear, whereas a constantly weight-bearing joint area benefits from lower collagen parallelism and a higher proteoglycan content...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to empirically test {{the effect that}} wind power production in Denmark has on volatility of the nord-pool wholesale electricity prices. The main result is that wind power tends to significantly reduce intraday volatility but increases volatility over larger time windows. The negative elasticity for intraday volatility is likely due to a larger-in-magnitude price effect of wind power on peak hours then off-peak hours. I suggest that this in turn {{is due to a}} steeper supply schedule at <b>peak-loads.</b> The positive elasticities in the wider time windows can be intuitively explained by the greater variability of the supply when large amounts of wind power are present. These finding have ramifications for investment in power generation, balancing as well as transmission capacity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Online auctions of {{governmental}} bonds and CO 2 certificates are challenged by high availability requirements in face of high peak loads around the auction deadline. Traditionally, these requirements are addressed by cluster solutions. However, with strong requirements regarding hard-ware ownership {{and only a}} few auctions per owner per year hardware clusters are a rather ineffective solution. Consequently, we contribute with a solution that alleviates the dependability problems by shifting them into the security domain: Key idea is to provide a secure timestamp service that allows users to place bids locally until the deadline, independent of server availability. This allows to mitigate <b>peak-loads</b> and network or server outages as the transfer of bids to the server can be delayed until after a performance peak or the repair of a failed component. In this paper in particular, we contribute with a secure time synchronization and timestamping protocol tailored to online auctions where we apply secure timestamps on smart cards locally connected to the bidder’s computer. Moreover, our timestamping protocol is robust with respect to man-in-the-middle delay attacks. Finally, we prove the feasibility of our approach based on a. NET smart card implementation and conclude with a discussion of current smart card limitations...|$|R

Using an EnergyPlus single-zone model, a parametric study is performed considering several window-to-wall ratios (WWRs), different solar orientations and some PCM-wallboards configurations. The main study goals are to: (i) explore the validity of a single PCM-wallboard solution that can be universally applied throughout residential buildings in Kuwait; (ii) evaluate the impact of PCMwallboard on the reduction of both cooling demand and peak-loads; (iii) provide some guidelines for incorporating PCM-wallboards in Kuwait.

40|$|Limiting <b>peak-loads</b> and {{reduction}} in energy consumption are two important considerations {{in the design}} of smart-home control systems. A smoother load profile benefits both utilities and the consumers, in terms of improved grid stability and QoS (fewer occurrences of load-shedding, brownouts and blackouts). Building energy loads are dominated by thermostatically controlled electrical devices (TCEDs) such as air-conditioners and heaters and these loads must be scheduled to deliver the desired thermal comfort by maintaining the temperature of a given environment within a band. Even though the periodic duty-cycle of TCEDs appears to make real-time scheduling algorithms suitable for the scheduling of TCEDs, we find that existing policies are not suitable for the coordinated control of TCED loads. Further, the loads must be managed taking into account important practical issues, especially, (i) considering mandatory restart-delay in scheduling compressor-driven TCEDs, (ii) avoiding undesirable switching (ON/OFF) of electrical appliances (to improve efficiency of the equipment and reduce failures), and (iii) accounting for the effect of periodic scheduling decisions, taken in discrete time, on the maintenance of thermal-comfort. We present a new Thermal Comfort-band Maintenance algorithm whose design is motivated by the above considerations. We also show how the approach leads to energy-efficiency and adaptive demand-response control by adapting the comfort-band.

The project aims at demonstrating a proof of concept on how smart grid solutions can be used to integrate large quantities of renewable energy sources in an existing network. The outcomes of the project are intended {{to pave the way for}} future renewable energy integration projects in Sweden. The Thesis focuses on one of the technical objectives of the SGG project, i. e. to increase the hosting capacity of wind power on Gotland from 195 MW to 200 MW by using Demand-Response (DR) from households and industries. DR consist of shifting <b>peak-loads</b> to peakproduction hours. The integration of additional wind power causes a risk of exceeding the transmission capacity of the power export cable between Gotland and the Swedish mainland. The approach considered for this Thesis is to use an Ancillary Service (AS) toolbox scheme based on multi-agent systems. The AS toolbox consist of flexibility tools such as DR on long-term, short-term, a battery energy storage system and a wind curtailment scheme. The DR activity includes space heating and domestic hot water consumption from detached houses on Gotland. The simulation results indicate that 1900 household participants are sufficient to balance the additional 5 MW for worst case scenarios. Furthermore, it is shown that the DR participation from industries contributes in some cases to a reduction of 700 household participants. The findings helped conclude that using an AS toolbox solution on Gotland is fully possible from a technical perspective.

40|$|Solar {{energy is}} a source, {{which can be}} {{exploited}} in two main ways to generate power: direct conversion into electric energy using photovoltaic panels and {{by means of a}} thermodynamic cycle. In both cases the amount of energy, which can be converted, is changing daily and seasonally, causing a discontinuous electricity production. In order to limit this drawback, concentrated solar power plants (CSP) and photovoltaic plants (PV) can be equipped with a storage system that can be configured not only for covering <b>peak-loads</b> but also for the base-load after the sunset or before the sunrise. In CSP plants it is the sun's thermal energy to be stored, whereas in PV applications it is the electrical energy to be stored in batteries, although this is not economically and environmentally feasible in large-scale power plants. The main aim {{of this paper is to}} study the performance of concentrated solar power plants equipped with molten salts thermal storage to cover a base load of 3 MWel. In order to verify the possibility of storing effectively the thermal energy and to design a plant for base load operation, two locations were chosen for the study: Gela in southern Italy, and Luxor in Egypt. The electricity production of the CSP facilities has been analyzed and then compared with the electricity production of PV plants. Two different comparisons were done, one by sizing the PV plant to provide the same peak power and one using the same collectors surface. This paper has also highlighted some important issues in site selection and in design criteria for CSP plants used for base load operation. The high variability of the direct normal radiation during the year in southern Italy may cause several problems in CSP facilities, mainly related to the wide range of energy input from the sun. The more uniform and higher values of the solar radiation in the Egyptian location mitigates this problem and allows achieving higher efficiencies than in southern Italy. In most cases the electricity produced by the CSP plant is higher than that produced by a similar PV plant, because the presence of the storage system guarantees the continuity of electricity production even without solar radiation. An economic analysis based on the estimation of the levelized electricity cost (LEC) for both CSP and PV power plants located both in south of Italy and Egypt was carried out in order to investigate which is the most cost effective solution. In all the cases considered, the CSP facilities resulted the best option in terms of cost of electricity produced due to the continuity of energy production during the night hours...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) In recent years, a {{rapid and}} {{dramatic}} increase in electrical power generation from renewable energy sources has been observed in many countries. Rapid increases in grid-connected small-scale solar photovoltaics (PV) have been driven by government incentives and renewable energy rebates, including residential feed-in tariffs and the financial policy of net metering. However, new challenges arise in balancing the generation of electricity with variable demand at all times as traditional fossil fuel-fired generators are retired and replaced with intermittent renewable electricity sources. This thesis looks at ways to balance distributor and customer benefits of battery storage co-located with solar PV, {{with a view to}} facilitating continual increases in grid-connected solar PV. Two issues that arise when accommodating significant residential-scale PV generation are addressed: the first is reverse power flow that leads to considerable voltage rise; the second corresponds to peak loads that occur infrequently, but potentially lead to the need for costly network augmentation when PV generation is unavailable. The benefits associated with addressing these two distributor issues are balanced with the benefit of scheduling battery storage to improve operational savings that accrue to customers. Conventional approaches to managing peak loads and reverse power flows in distribution networks vary from country-to-country, since they are often driven by government policies and regulation. In the Australian context, {{the first part of the}} thesis introduces typical costs associated with the design and operation of electrical networks to assess the economic viability of large-scale energy storage. We also introduce a publicly available dataset consisting of load and rooftop PV generation for 300 de-identified Australian residential customers in a distribution network. All simulation-based results in the thesis incorporate data from this publicly available dataset. The second part of the thesis considers potential savings that accrue to residential customers that co-locate battery storage with solar PV. We address reverse power flow and <b>peak-loads</b> coincident with peak pricing periods where the residential customer designs battery charge and discharge schedules. This leads us to a constrained optimization-based problem that we formulate as a quadratic program. The third part of the thesis focuses on coordinated approaches to charge and discharge residential battery storage. Emphasis is given to the management of bi-directional power flows in a distribution grid, and the maintenance of supply voltages within prescribed limits. This has motivated a novel approach to Adaptive-Receding Horizon Optimization (A-RHO). We implement our A-RHO approach in a GridLAB-D model of an Australian distribution network to assess the distributor beneits...|$|R
40|$|Today, as a rule, {{the most}} {{cost-effective}} way to remove nitrogen from municipal wastewater is the biological method based on nitrification and subsequent denitrification. All biological systems may be affected by toxicants, and biological nitrogen removal is no exception. An investigation of influent wastewaters from 109 Swedish {{municipal wastewater treatment plant}}s was accomplished. Inhibitory substances were detected in about 60 % of the wastewaters. The level of inhibition was in general low, but at 4 % of the plants, considerable inhibition was found. The main contribution to inhibitory substances found in the influent of a municipal wastewater treatment plant originates from industrial discharge. It is not possible to point out any special branch that invariably delivers inhibitory wastewater. Internal sources of inhibition should not be neglected. The effect of severe acute accidents is immediate and easy to detect but the, perhaps more important, concealed effects of a suppressed nitrification capacity will only be noticed by chance when the plant is running to capacity, for example during winter operation and <b>peak-loads.</b> A short-term nitrification inhibition test has been used in this study. Short-term inhibition tests do not mirror detailed effects on a wastewater treatment plant, but they are useful tools when identifying/solving problems. A method based on nitrifying organisms is preferable when the purpose of an investigation is to reveal sources that might affect nitrification at wastewater treatment plants. The chosen activated sludge type in the test has an effect on the obtained level of inhibition. The sensitivity of activated sludge from a specific treatment plant remains stable over prolonged periods. The suspended solids concentration used in the test has an effect on the inhibition results for some, but not for all, inhibitors. The heterotrophic respiration rate of the activated sludge used might affect the obtained results if the inhibitor is easily degradable. The ammonium concentration in the test tubes affects the results obtained for competitive inhibitors. No important difference could be distinguished between the inhibition found at 15 °C and 20 °C, respectively. Neither has any effect on the nitrification rate of the sludge been detected. In order to observe and verify inhibition of nitrification, a comprehensive sampling programme is required since the variation of inhibition is often substantial and irregular and since many sources contribute to the total inhibition. Requirements regarding nitrification inhibition should be set and, consequently, applied when outlet permits for industries are to be issued or renewed. The possibilities for a wastewater treatment plant to neutralise the effects of inhibitory wastewater are limited. Consequently, preventive measures will be a preferable way to control inhibition. Possible measures at industries that have been shown to discharge inhibitory wastewater are to change the properties of the wastewater by altered methods of production, or by detoxification of the wastewater by internal treatment. Nitrification-inhibition measurements on untreated and treated wastewater can be used for judging the detoxification potential of a treatment method. Alternatively industries can show that the inhibitor is easily degradable or that the biological processes in question easily adapts to the wastewater...|$|R
