5|$|Sabhapathi (Paruchuri Venkateswara Rao) {{works for}} Bhagavan. Munna mistreats Sabhapathi, but Bhagavan doesn't care. Sabhapathi joins Kulkarni's gang to <b>protect</b> <b>himself.</b> Jaidev kidnaps Sampath's (Sampath Raj) son. Munna kills Sampath's son due to {{laughter}} over Jahnavi loving Jaidev. Munna confronts Jahnavi at Jaidev's flat. Munna brutally murders her. Jaidev kills Munna by throwing {{him from his}} flat. This scene is seen by Guravayya (Tanikella Bharani), an associate of Bhagavan who is an informer to Kulkarni. He reports this to Bhagavan {{to get rid of}} Jaidev.|$|E
5|$|According to flashbacks {{during the}} game, Squall {{grew up in}} an orphanage with the other playable {{characters}} (except Rinoa). The orphans were cared for by Edea; although Squall remembers little about his past, he becomes an emotionally detached, cynical and introverted boy whose original goal is to go through life without any emotional ties or dependence. He gradually warms, and it is later revealed that his detachment from his companions is a defensive mechanism to <b>protect</b> <b>himself</b> from the emotional pain he suffered when he and his older sister were separated.|$|E
5|$|As well as food, camping equipment, and dog-care gear, mushers {{must carry}} an axe, a cold-weather {{sleeping}} bag, {{a pair of}} snowshoes, veterinary records, Quest promotional material, a cooker, and eight booties per dog. Included in the required promotional material are numerous event covers intended to reflect the Quest's ancestry as a mail route. One unusual rule requires mushers to immediately butcher any game animal killed during the race. This rule was applied in 1993, when a musher was attacked by a moose and killed it to <b>protect</b> <b>himself.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{traditional}} {{accounts of}} Du's career {{indicated that he}} was not talented—that while he served as general and chancellor, he only cared about <b>protecting</b> <b>himself</b> and did not advance the careers of talented people.|$|R
5|$|Day {{wished for}} the girls to be {{isolated}} from external influences while he educated them so, {{at the beginning of}} November 1769, he decided to move them to France. It is also possible that he did this to <b>protect</b> <b>himself</b> from the legal ramifications of his experiment, as well as societal gossip. The trio travelled over 600 miles to Avignon, renting a house in le quartier des fusteries. The girls could speak no French and Day employed no English-speaking servants, to be sure that he would be the only person to influence them.|$|E
5|$|Due to its nature, {{the episode}} {{featured}} many dangerous stunts utilizing fire. In {{the scene where}} Mulder and L'Ively confront each other {{at either end of}} a corridor in the Marsden family home, and L'Ively sets fire to the entire hallway, Mark Sheppard, who played L'Ively, ducked out of the shot in order to <b>protect</b> <b>himself</b> from the intense heat. The only injury involved in the production was when David Duchovny burned his hand, leaving a small permanent scar. The character of Phoebe Green was considered as a recurring role, but this episode ended up being her only appearance.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} give the strike teeth and to <b>protect</b> <b>himself</b> from harm, Verro {{became a member of}} a Mafia group in Corleone, the Fratuzzi (Little Brothers). However, during the great strike of the Fasci in September 1893, the Fratuzzi mobilized to boycott it, {{providing}} the necessary manpower to work on the lands that the peasants refused to cultivate. After that, Verro broke away from the mafiosi, and – according to police reports – became their most bitter enemy. He was killed by the Mafia in 1915 when he was the mayor of Corleone.|$|E

5|$|Shawn Michaels, who had {{originally}} been booked to win the Intercontinental Championship from Bret Hart at SummerSlam, won the title from Davey Boy Smith on October 27 (the match would air on the November 14, 1992, episode of Saturday Night's Main Event). Michaels and Sherri continued their on-screen relationship after SummerSlam. Sherri claimed to have created the rivalry with Martel to test Michaels' love for her. Their relationship deteriorated, though when Michaels pulled Sherri {{in front of him}} to <b>protect</b> <b>himself</b> from an attack by his former tag team partner, Marty Jannetty on the October 31 episode of WWF Superstars. This led to confrontations between Sherri and Michaels at Royal Rumble 1993 and WrestleMania IX.|$|E
5|$|Another {{purpose for}} issuing the edict, as {{described}} within the papyrus upon {{which part of}} the edict was inscribed, was to appease the gods who had delivered Caracalla from conspiracy. The conspiracy in question {{was in response to}} Caracalla's murder of Geta and the subsequent slaughter of his followers; fratricide would only have been condoned if his brother had been a tyrant. The damnatio memoriae against Geta and the large payments Caracalla had made to his own supporters were designed to <b>protect</b> <b>himself</b> from possible repercussions. After this had succeeded, Caracalla felt the need to repay the gods of Rome by returning the favour to the people of Rome through a similarly grand gesture. This was done through the granting of citizenship.|$|E
5|$|Crash Bandicoot is a {{platform}} {{game in which}} players control the titular protagonist, Crash, as he traverses several levels in sequence in order to progress. Crash is able to defeat enemies by either jumping on them or using a spinning attack that launches them. Crash will lose a life if he is hit by an enemy or obstacle, or falls into a bottomless pit. Crash can <b>protect</b> <b>himself</b> by collecting Aku Aku masks, which protect Crash from a single hit from an enemy or obstacle (but not pits or other instant-death obstacles). Crash can hold onto two masks at a time and, upon collecting a third mask, will gain temporary invincibility. The game ends when the player runs out of lives, with more lives earned by finding extra life items or by collecting 100 Wumpa Fruit.|$|E
50|$|Dowse was {{the only}} {{survivor}} of the attack launched by Opossunoquonuske and her Appomattoc warriors against a party from the Jamestown settlement in 1610; he <b>protected</b> <b>himself</b> by using the rudder of the men's boat as a shield. The English destroyed the Indians' village {{in retaliation for the}} massacre.|$|R

5000|$|Cross (Burt Lancaster) is an {{experienced}} but retiring Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agent and assassin who is training free-lance hit-man Jean Laurier (Alain Delon) (alias [...] "Scorpio") to replace him.

5|$|John Constantine, {{the main}} {{character}} of Hellblazer, was portrayed {{as a kind of}} confidence man and occult detective who did morally questionable things, arguably for the greater good. He usually triumphed through guile, deceit, and misdirection, but often made more enemies in the process than he defeated. Indeed, it was a common theme in the book that Constantine was unable to effect any lasting change or enjoy unequivocal victories. While sometimes striving for the good of mankind, Constantine was often manipulative and a dangerous person to have as a friend, as the lives and souls of those around him became perilously involved in his misadventures. He took pains to <b>protect</b> <b>himself</b> from direct attacks, but his friends and relatives were often endangered in order to strike at him. The spirits of deceased friends haunted him, individually or as an entourage of ghosts.|$|E
5|$|One of the staged feuds {{heading into}} the event was between Tatanka and Intercontinental Champion Shawn Michaels. Tatanka {{was in the midst}} of an undefeated streak and had {{wrestled}} Michaels twice in the months leading up to WrestleMania IX. Tatanka pinned Michaels in a singles match on the February 13, 1993, episode of WWF Superstars of Wrestling and later teamed with The Nasty Boys in a six-man match against Michaels and the Beverly Brothers; Tatanka pinned Michaels to win this match as well. Michaels was also feuding with Sensational Sherri, who stood in Tatanka's corner during the match. Sherri had been Michaels' valet. When Marty Jannetty tried to hit Michaels with a mirror, however, Michaels pulled Sherri in front of him to <b>protect</b> <b>himself.</b> Sherri's anger at getting hit over the head with a mirror caused her to turn on him at Royal Rumble 1993.|$|E
5|$|Holmes {{had served}} under Kit Carson and John C. Fremont, {{but he was}} old and {{physically}} impaired when he met Burnham. He had lost all of his family in the Indian wars and before he died he wanted to impart {{his knowledge of the}} frontier to the young Burnham. The two men traveled throughout the American Southwest and northern Mexico, and Holmes taught him many scouting skills, such as how to track a trail, how to double and cover one's own trail, how to properly ascend and descend precipices, and how to tell the time at night. Burnham also learned survival skills from Holmes, such as where to find water in the desert, how to <b>protect</b> <b>himself</b> from snakes, and what to do in case of forest fires or floods. A stickler for details, Holmes impressed on him that even in the simplest things, such as braiding a rope, tying a knot, or putting on or taking off a saddle, there is a right way and a wrong way. The two men earned a living by hunting and prospecting. Burnham also worked as a cowboy, a guard for the mines, a guide, and a scout during these years.|$|E
50|$|At age 11, due to {{the start}} of the Iran-Iraq war, his father sent him to Poitiers, France with his aunt Mahnaz. After his minor amateur career, Mayhar Monshipour turned {{professional}} on October 26, 1996 by knocking out Karim Azagzaoui during the 6th round in a rather rough fight. He then went on to win 5 consecutive matches, all ending in knockouts. At the time, his style was already that of a slugger, but he started boxing on his opponents without <b>protecting</b> <b>himself</b> and his only technique was to “jump headlong”. In December 1997, he fought the Congolese Euloge Makiza Sita (8 wins and 2 losses). Monshipour showed to be stronger but made the mistake of not <b>protecting</b> <b>himself.</b> Being the more powerful fighter, he sent Sita to the mat twice causing Sita to lose points.|$|R
50|$|In {{the film}} Iron Man (2008), Obadiah Stane uses a small {{handheld}} sonic device to cause temporary paralysis. He uses this {{first on the}} terrorist leader Raza in Gulmira and then on Tony Stark in order to steal the Arc Reactor from his chest. He <b>protects</b> <b>himself</b> from the device with special electronic earplugs.|$|R
5000|$|Mills {{thought he}} should ensure that the Ellington Orchestra always had top musicians and <b>protected</b> <b>himself</b> by forming the Mills Blue Rhythm Band, using them as a relief band at the Cotton Club.

5|$|On May 23, 1994, Mexican State Judicial Police arrested Olivarez {{again in}} Matamoros for {{possessing}} two stolen vehicles. He {{was interviewed by}} Mexican authorities and stated {{that he was not}} guilty of Fischer's murder. He admitted to having stolen cars since he was young, and stated that Garza was trying to put the blame on him to <b>protect</b> <b>himself</b> from prosecution. Olivarez justified himself by saying that he had never been arrested with a gun. He admitted going to Dallas in 1992, but stated that he only knew Garza by name. He said he was a self-employed auto mechanic who supported his wife, mother, and uncle. Mexican officials said that Olivarez's auto theft ring extended all the way to Monterrey, as well as in Río Bravo, Valle Hermoso, and Matamoros, Tamaulipas. There was an arrest warrant for him issued by a state judge in Reynosa for being connected to about 50 car thefts. Brownsville investigators went to Mexico {{to see if they could}} talk to Olivarez, and began extradition procedings to bring him to a Texan court.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{levels are}} {{available}} in each of eight worlds, which are shown in the Nintendo DS' bottom touchscreen while viewing the world map. The map of the currently selected world appears in the top screen, {{which is used to}} navigate between the world's levels. The goal of each level is to reach a black flag {{at the end of the}} level. At the end of each world, a boss must be defeated before proceeding to the next world. There are six power-ups available in New Super Mario Bros.; the game allows the player to store an extra power-up when he is already using one, a feature carried over from Super Mario World. Three power-ups from Super Mario Bros. return: the Super Mushroom makes Mario grow in size, the Fire Flower lets Mario throw fireballs, and the Starman makes Mario temporarily invincible. Three more power-ups are introduced in New Super Mario Bros.: the Blue Koopa Shell lets Mario withdraw into a shell to <b>protect</b> <b>himself,</b> the Mega Mushroom grows Mario to an incredible size, and the Mini-Mushroom makes Mario very small.|$|E
5|$|Williamson {{and other}} members of Jamaica's lesbian, gay, bisexual, and {{transgender}} (LGBT) community decided to form an organisation to campaign for their rights, resulting in the establishment of the Jamaica Forum for Lesbians, All Sexuals, and Gays (J-FLAG) in December 1998. J-FLAG sought to enhance LGBT rights through advocacy and encouraging legal reform, as well as through educational and social service programs. They also kept a record of anti-LGBT hate crimes including assaults, home invasions, and the corrective rape of lesbians, further recording the murder of 30 gay men between 1997 and 2004. From the time of the group's foundation, its members were subjected to repeated death threats. Williamson became the public face of the group, appearing on radio talk shows and television shows such as Perspective and Nationwide in which he argued against homophobia and called for greater government investment to tackle the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Unlike most other LGBT rights activists in Jamaica, Williamson did not seek to <b>protect</b> <b>himself</b> by using a pseudonym, disguising his voice, or hiding his appearance. Facing hostility and threats of violence, Williamson left Jamaica and moved to Canada and then England, before returning to the island in 2002. There, he moved into an apartment in his Haughton Street compound and decided to take a renewed role within Jamaica's LGBT rights movement. He lived in one room of his apartment block and rented out a number of others.|$|E

25|$|The works not {{assigned}} {{as a part}} of Cassiodorus's {{educational program}} must be examined critically. Because he had been working under the newly dominant power of the Ostrogoths, the writer demonstrably alters the narrative of history for the sake of <b>protecting</b> <b>himself.</b> The same could easily be said about his ideas, which were presented as non-threatening in their approach to peaceful meditation and its institutional isolationism.|$|R
50|$|Foremost amongst these powers is {{the ability}} to tap into a {{limitless}} energy source called the Quantum Zone. Quasar can project quantum energy in the form of devastating beams of force or heat, but Vaughn more commonly employed them to fashion incredibly durable constructs of solid energy, such as containment spheres or pincers. He <b>protected</b> <b>himself</b> with a personal force field of quantum energy.|$|R
25|$|Generally, Springer {{tends to}} present his program {{standing}} up pacing the aisle steps between the seating areas rather than having a podium or mark on the main stage. This {{is thought to be}} to <b>protect</b> <b>himself</b> from the potential violence occurring on the stage.|$|E
25|$|The Pre-Raphaelite painter John Everett Millais {{managed to}} create a sentimental moment in the {{massacre}} in his painting A Huguenot on St. Bartholomew's Day (1852), which depicts a Catholic woman attempting to convince her Huguenot lover to wear the white scarf badge of the Catholics and <b>protect</b> <b>himself.</b> The man, true to his beliefs, gently refuses her. Millais was inspired to create the painting after seeing Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, Lanata {{revealed}} that a vault holding cash and sensitive documents was emptied and refitted as a wine cellar. One of the workers {{who took part in}} the conversion of the vault into a wine cellar took photos to <b>protect</b> <b>himself,</b> fearing he was involved in an illegal activity. Lanata sardonically congratulated Báez, who only a few years earlier had been a low-level bank employee, for amassing a fortune quicker than Henry Ford or Bill Gates.|$|E
50|$|Ethan {{thought he}} had <b>protected</b> <b>himself</b> from his older sister’s world—the land of Faery.

But when destiny comes for Ethan, there is no escape from a danger long, long forgotten.|$|R

50|$|Because of the situation, Bohlool acted insanely by the Imam's order. By doing this, he {{was saved}} from Haroun's punishment. Now, without any fear of danger, and in amusing ways, Bohlool <b>protected</b> <b>himself</b> from tyrannies. He insulted the notorious Khalifa and his courtiers just by talking. Nevertheless, people {{acknowledged}} his superior wisdom and excellence. Even today {{many of his}} stories are narrated in assemblies and teach the listeners valuable lessons.|$|R
