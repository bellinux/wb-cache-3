50|$|A memory <b>protection</b> <b>key</b> (MPK) {{mechanism}} divides physical memory up into {{blocks of}} a particular size (e.g., 4 kiB), {{each of which has}} an associated numerical value called a <b>protection</b> <b>key.</b> Each process also has a <b>protection</b> <b>key</b> value associated with it. On a memory access the hardware checks that the current process's <b>protection</b> <b>key</b> matches the value associated with the memory block being accessed; if not, an exception occurs. This mechanism was introduced in the System/360 architecture. It is available on today's System z mainframes and heavily used by System z operating systems and their subsystems.|$|E
50|$|In the Itanium and PA architectures, {{translations}} (TLB entries) have keys (Itanium) {{or access}} ids (PA) associated with them. A running process has several <b>protection</b> <b>key</b> registers (16 for Itanium, 4 for HP/PA). A translation {{selected by the}} virtual address has its key compared {{to each of the}} <b>protection</b> <b>key</b> registers. If any of them match (plus other possible checks), the access is permitted. If none match, a fault or exception is generated. The software fault handler can, if desired, check the missing key against a larger list of keys maintained by software; thus, the <b>protection</b> <b>key</b> registers inside the processor may be treated as a software-managed cache of a larger list of keys associated with a process.|$|E

5000|$|In the x86, the {{protection}} keys [...] architecture allows tagging virtual addresses for user pages {{with any of}} 16 protection keys. All the pages tagged with the same <b>protection</b> <b>key</b> constitute a protection domain, A new register contains the permissions associated with each of {{the protection}} domain. Load and store operations are checked against both the page table permissions and the <b>protection</b> <b>key</b> permissions associated with the protection domain of the virtual address, and only allowed if both permissions allow the access. The <b>protection</b> <b>key</b> permissions can be set from user space, allowing applications to directly restrict access to the application data without OS intervention. Since the protection keys are associated with a virtual address, the protection domains are per address space, so processes running in different address spaces can each use all 16 domains.|$|E

50|$|A {{hardware-based}} <b>protection</b> <b>key,</b> or dongle, is {{best suited}} to software publishers concerned about the security of their product as it offers {{the highest level of}} copy protection and IP protection. Although a key must be physically connected in order to access or run an application, end users are not required to install any device drivers on their machines. A software-based <b>protection</b> <b>key</b> is ideal for software publishers who require flexible license delivery. The virtual nature of software keys eliminates the need to ship a physical product, thus enabling end users to quickly install and use an application with minimal fuss. Cloud-based licensing, on the other hand, provides automatic and immediate license enablement, so users can access software from any device including virtual machines and mobile devices.|$|E
