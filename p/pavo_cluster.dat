40|$|In our {{systematic}} optical galaxy search {{behind the}} southern Milky Way, 3760 (mostly unknown) galaxies with diameters D > 0. 2 arcminutes {{were identified in}} the Crux region (287 < l < 318 degrees, |b| < 10 degrees, Woudt & Kraan-Korteweg 1997). Prior to this investigation, only 65 of these galaxies had known redshifts. In order to map the galaxy distribution in redshift space we obtained spectra for 226 bright (B_J < 18. 0 mag) objects with the 1. 9 m telescope of the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO). Two main structures crossing the Galactic Plane in the Crux region have now become clear. A narrow, nearby filament from (l,b) = (340 deg, - 25 deg) to the Centaurus cluster can be traced. This filament runs almost parallel to {{the extension of the}} Hydra-Antlia clusters found earlier and is part of what we have earlier termed the ``Centaurus Wall'' extending in redshift-space between 0 < v < 6000 km/s (Fairall & Paverd 1995). The main outcome of this survey however, is the recognition of another massive extended structure between 4000 < v < 8000 km/s. This broad structure, dubbed the Norma Supercluster (Woudt et al. 1997), runs nearly parallel to the Galactic Plane from Vela to ACO 3627 (its centre) from where it continues to the <b>Pavo</b> <b>cluster.</b> This massive structure is believed {{to be associated with the}} Great Attractor. The survey has furthermore revealed a set of cellular structures, similar to those seen in redshift space at higher galactic latitudes, but never before seen so clearly behind the Milky Way.

40|$|To further our {{understanding}} of the Great Attractor (GA), we have undertaken a redshift survey using the 2 dF on the AAT. Clusters and filaments in the GA region were targeted with 25 separate pointings resulting in approximately 2600 new redshifts. Targets included poorly studied X-ray clusters from the CIZA catalogue as well as the Cen-Crux and PKS 1343 - 601 clusters, both of which lie close to the classic GA centre. For nine clusters in the region, we report velocity distributions as well as virial and projected mass estimates. The virial mass of CIZA J 1324. 7 - 5736, now identified as a separate structure from the Cen-Crux cluster, is found to be 3 x 10 ^ 14 M_sun, in good agreement with the X-ray inferred mass. In the PKS 1343 - 601 field, five redshifts are measured of which four are new. An analysis of redshifts from this survey, in combination with those from the literature, reveals the dominant structure in the GA region to be a large filament, which appears to extend from Abell S 0639 (l= 281, b=+ 11) to (l 5, b - 50), encompassing the Cen-Crux, CIZA J 1324. 7 - 5736, Norma and <b>Pavo</b> II <b>clusters.</b> Behind the Norma Cluster at cz 15000 km/s, the masses of four rich clusters are calculated. These clusters (Triangulum-Australis, Ara, CIZA J 1514. 6 - 4558 and CIZA J 1410. 4 - 4246) may contribute to a continued large-scale flow beyond the GA. The results of these observations will be incorporated into a subsequent analysis of the GA flow. Comment: 13 pages, 8 figures. Accepted for publication in MNRAS.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{dynamics}} of the local Universe with particular reference to discovering the source of the Local Group (LG) motion. A redshift survey of the Great Attractor (GA) region, thought responsible for a significant fraction of the LG motion, is presented. Over 3053 galaxies, located in both clusters and filaments, were targeted using the 2 dF on the AAT. Velocity distributions and mass estimates for nine clusters are reported. Together with redshifts from the literature, this survey reveals the dominant feature in the core of the GA to be a large filament extending from Abell S 0639 (l= 281 º, b=+ 11 º) towards a point at I ~ 5 º b ~ - 50 º, encompassing the Cen-Crux, CIZA J 1324. 7 - 5736, Norma and <b>Pavo</b> II <b>clusters.</b> A new model of the local velocity field out to ՅՕՕh(^- 1) Мрc is derived from the combined REFLEX, BCS and CIZA surveys: the RBC catalogue. This is the first all-sky, X-ray selected galaxy cluster sample. The reconstruction includes an intrinsic correction for the bias of clusters in tracing the total density field. The velocity fields from both this reconstruction and that of the PSCz survey are compared to the observed peculiar velocities of 98 local type la supernovae (SNIa). The best fits are respectively found for values of βRBC(= Ω(^ 0. 6) m /(^b) RBC) = 0. 39 ± 0. 20 and βι = 0. 55 ± 0. 06. These results are found to be robust to culls of the SNIa sample by distance, host-galaxy extinction and the reference frame in which the comparison is carried out. As the PSCz preferentially samples late-type galaxies, the derived density field under- Samples the contributions from regions of greatest over density, precisely the regions traced by the RBC survey. When combined in the ratio 78 % PSCz, 22 % RBC these two complimentary reconstructions are a better fit to the ресuliar velocities of the same SNIa sample than either one alone. Compared to galaxy surveys, which only see contributions to the LG motion from structures within - 60 h(^- 1) Мрc, previous cluster surveys have argued that sources at much greater distances (~ 150 h(^- 1) Mpc) influence local dynamics. However, the RBC reconstruction presented here shows similar contributions from the same depths as the PSCz, which is partly attributed to the intrinsic bias correction and inclusion of the Virgo cluster in the RBC. The extended GA region, defined as the volume enclosed by 250 < / < 350 º, 一 45 < ь < 45 º and 2000 <cz< 6000 km s (^- 1) is found to be responsible for 65 % of the LG motion, whilst the more distant (~ 145 h(^- 1) Mpc) SSC only accounts for 12 %.
