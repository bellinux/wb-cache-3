40|$|Abstract: Trihalomethanes (THMs) {{are formed}} as a results of the {{reaction}} of residual chlorine, used as a disinfectant in drinking water, with the organic matter in raw water. Although chlorinated and brominated THMs {{are the most common}} disinfection by-products (DBPs) reported, iodinated THMs (I-THMs) can be formed when iodide is present in raw water. I-THMs have been usually associated with several medicinal or <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>taste</b> and odor problems and is a potential health concern since they have been reported to be more toxic than their brominated and chlorinated analogs. Currently, there is no published standard ana-lytical method for I-THMs in water. An automated headspace-gas chromatography/electron capture detector (GC/ECD) technique was developed for routine analysis of 10 THMs including 6 I-THMs in water samples. The optimization of the method is discussed. The limits of detection (LOD) and limits of quantification (LOQ) range from 12 ng/L to 56 ng/L and from 38 ng/L to 178 ng/L for 10 THMs, respectively. Matrix effects in river water, sea water and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) final effluent water were investigated and it was shown that the method is suitable for the analysis of trace levels of I-THMs, {{in a wide range of}} waters...|$|E
40|$|In the <b>pharmaceutical</b> industry, <b>taste</b> masking {{techniques}} {{are applied to}} prevent active pharmaceutical ingredients exhibiting a bitter and unpleasant taste. The oral administration of bitter drugs through solid dosage forms requires an acceptable degree of palatability, patient tolerance and significant therapeutic value. In the recent years, enormous progress in taste masking technologies {{has given rise to}} novel strategies such as fast dissolving dosage forms, chewable tablets and coating of molten materials. Similarly, common technologies applying double coating layers, microencapsulation or even chemical modification have been employed to improve patient compliance. This review endeavours to present the practical technologies and platforms applied for taste masking and indicate the most interesting features of each approach...|$|R

MDF which disintegrate or dissolve within 1 min when placed in the mouth without drinking water or chewing. Also, used for the taste masking of widely bitter tasted drugs which are most important for the paediatric patients. These drug delivery systems allow the medication to bypass the first pass metabolism thereby making the medication more bio available. Formulation of oral films involves the application of both aesthetic and performance characteristics such as plasticized hydrocolloids, active <b>pharmaceutical</b> ingredient, <b>taste</b> masking agent being laminated by solvent casting or hot melt extrusion. Solvent casting being the most preferred offers great uniformity of thickness and films have fine gloss and better physical properties. Oral strips are evaluated for various attributes such as thickness, Surface pH, folding endurance, disintegration and dissolution study.

40|$|Amongst {{the plethora}} of avenues {{explored}} for rapid drug releasing products, oral strip technology (OST) is gaining much attention. Dissolvable oral thin films (OTFs) evolved {{over the past few}} years from the confection and oral care markets in the form of breath strips and became a novel and widely accepted form by consumers. Fast-dissolving oral films are solid dosage forms, which disintegrate or dissolve within 1 min when placed in the mouth without drinking water or chewing. These drug delivery systems allow the medication to bypass the first pass metabolism thereby making the medication more bioavailable. The sublingual and buccal delivery of a drug via thin film has the potential to improve the onset of action, lower the dosing and eliminate patientâ€™s fear of chocking. Formulation of oral films involves the application of both aesthetic and performance characteristics such as plasticized hydrocolloids, active <b>pharmaceutical</b> ingredient, <b>taste</b> masking agent being laminated by solvent casting or hot melt extrusion. Solvent casting being the most preferred offers great uniformity of thickness and films have fine gloss and better physical properties. Oral strips are evaluated for various attributes such as thickness, folding endurance, disintegration and dissolution time.

40|$|The {{majority}} of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) found in oral dosage forms have a bitter taste. Masking the unpleasant taste of bitter, APIs {{is a major}} challenge {{in the development of}} such oral dosage forms. Taste assessment is an important quality-control parameter for evaluating taste-masked formulations of any new molecular entity. Hot-melt extrusion (HME) techniques, have very recently, been accepted from an industrial compliance viewpoint in relation to both manufacturing operations and development of <b>pharmaceuticals.</b> HME achieves <b>taste</b> masking of bitter APIs via various mechanisms such as the formation of solid dispersions and inter-molecular interactions and this has led to its wide-spread use in pharmaceutical formulation research. In this article, the uses of various taste evaluation methods and HME as continuous processing techniques for taste masking of bitter APIs used for the oral delivery of drugs are reviewed...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. NaCl {{has proven}} to be an {{effective}} bitterness inhibitor, but the reason remains unclear. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the influence of a variety of cations and anions on the bitterness of selected oral <b>pharmaceuticals</b> and bitter <b>taste</b> stimuli: pseudoephedrine, ranitidine, acetaminophen, quinine, and urea. Method. Human psychophysical taste evaluation using a whole mouth exposure procedure was used. Results. The cations (all associated with the acetate anion) inhibited bitterness when mixed with pharmaceutical solutions to varying degrees. The sodium cation significantly (P < 0. 003) inhibited bitterness of the pharmaceuticals more than the other cations. The anions (all associated with the sodium cation) also inhibited bitterness to varying degrees. With the exception of salicylate, the glutamate and adenosine monophosphate anions significantly (P < 0. 001) inhibited bitterness of the pharmaceuticals more than the other anions. Also, there were several specific inhibitory interactions between ammonium, sodium and salicylate and certain pharmaceuticals. Conclusions. We conclude that sodium was the most successful cation and glutamate and AMP were the most successful anions at inhibiting bitterness. Structure forming and breaking properties of ions, as predicted by the Hofmeister series, and other physical-chemical ion properties failed to significantly predict bitterness inhibition. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Coatings {{are very}} {{important}} in <b>pharmaceutical</b> formulation for <b>taste</b> masking, drug protection, and drug release modification. Most film coatings are applied using polymer solutions {{but the use of}} organic solvents implies some disadvantages, like solvent exposure, solvent disposal and product contamination by residual. Furthermore, such solvents are flammable and toxic for operators and their use cannot be considered pollution-free. Although the use of water as a coating-solvent eliminates many of these disadvantages, it could lead to other problems like processing time increase and long-term stability issues for some products. Among the various solventless processes, compression coating retains some importance, for example to delay or to control drug release, to associate incompatible drugs in the fixed dose combination, to target two drugs in different areas of the gastrointestinal tract, to obtain a pulsatile time-dependent release and to incorporate poorly compactable materials in the core. This coating procedure has been shaded by the difficulty to develop a manufacturing process able to localize the core {{in the center of the}} coated tablet. In the last years different manufacturing methods have been proposed to overcome this inconvenient. In particular a one-step dry-coating tablet manufacturing method implemented by Ozeky et al. is noteworthy for producing thinner coatings. Recently we have developed a thermal procedure to obtain, from a direct compression (DC) tablet containing a cross-linked polycarboxylic acid and a cellulose derivative, a bioadhesive matrix able to control the drug release. The mechanism controlling drug release is based on the formation of a non-erodible water-swellable matrix, whose behaviour can be modulated on the basis of thermal procedure and excipient composition. The unique features of this procedure make it also applicable to the manufacturing of coated tablets. Here we illustrate the preliminary experimental evidence gathered using this matrix in compression-coated tablets...|$|R
