5|$|When WCW was {{purchased}} by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 2001, Keibler's contract was bought by the WWF. She portrayed a heel character in The Alliance. She made her WWF television debut on the June 14, 2001 episode of SmackDown! when then-face, Shane McMahon {{brought her to the}} ring to distract then-heel, Rhyno, causing him to lose a match. Keibler originally teamed up with real-life friend, then-heel, Torrie Wilson, and the pair feuded with Trish Stratus and Lita. During this feud the four wrestlers competed in the first-ever tag team Bra and Panties Match at the Invasion pay-per-view, which Trish and Lita won by stripping Stacy down to her yellow bra & <b>panties</b> <b>and</b> Torrie Wilson to her white bra & panties.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a blonde Spears sitting and {{laughing}} in a bar with two female friends, but stops {{to look at a}} brunette Spears calling out to her on a small stage in front of them, wearing a leather vest, a studded belt, <b>panties</b> <b>and</b> fishnet stockings while sporting a tattoo on her biceps. She dances erotically around a pole and up against a mirror. Throughout the video, she continues to dance and flip her hair while special effects lights flash around her as the camera moves slightly in and out of focus to the beat of the song. The video's light systems change from black and white with aura-like blue and pink hues to full blown color. Around the middle of the video, she is joined by two alter egos of her female friends, who also dance around the pole. The blonde Spears and her friends, while watching the dancing, later draw their attention to an attractive man sitting with his friends at a table across the bar.|$|E
5|$|The {{video is}} shot in {{black-and-white}} and {{is set in}} a dimly lit and smoky office, where Beyoncé puts on a private show for a detective (played by actor Brett G. Smith). As the clip begins, the detective is gazing out the window. Beyoncé then arrives and stands in an open doorway while rain pours outside. With wavy hair and winged eyeliner, Beyoncé is dressed in a thigh-length leather trench coat and high stockings. After walking inside the office, she immediately strips off her coat. This reveals a satin dress over black <b>panties</b> <b>and</b> thigh-high pantyhose held up by garters. When the music starts, Beyoncé sits on a desk and plays with her hair, her back facing the face of the detective. The latter leans against his desk while watching Beyoncé, who starts to dance sensually on the desk and flips her hair to seduce him. As Beyoncé dances around the armchair, she exposes her vintage-style underwear.|$|E

25|$|The monsters of {{the week}} in the series, Ghosts are twisted aberrations born from the regrets or {{suffering}} {{of people who have}} died and become lost in limbo. <b>Panty</b> <b>and</b> Stocking are tasked with their destruction, which allows them to pass on to Heaven, leaving behind Heaven Coins. Although most Ghosts are savage or destructive, some are relatively harmless annoyances or even oppose their true nature and try to live peacefully. Ghosts are usually slain with angelic weapons, but there are other means of destroying them, such as Ghosts killing each other or peacefully accomplishing what they wanted to achieve in life. As a recurring joke, whenever <b>Panty</b> <b>and</b> Stocking defeat a Ghost with their angelic weapons, a paper-mache model of the Ghost is filmed being blown-up.|$|R
2500|$|The show {{revolves}} around the exploits of the Anarchy sisters, <b>Panty</b> <b>and</b> Stocking, angels who were kicked out of Heaven due to their bad behavior. They are sent to Daten City—a pun on the Japanese word —a place {{on the border between}} Heaven and Hell, which is besieged by evil spirits referred to as [...] "Ghosts". The sisters take refuge under the care of the reverend Garterbelt; under his watchful eyes, the sisters are tasked with using their ability to transform their lingerie into weapons, and using them to destroy malicious Ghosts. By doing so, the sisters earn [...] "Heaven Coins" [...] with which they intend to one day use to buy their way back into Heaven. However, <b>Panty</b> <b>and</b> Stocking are constantly sidetracked by their respective interests in men and sugary sweets.|$|R

25|$|In cold climates, {{underwear}} may {{constitute an}} additional layer of clothing helping {{to keep the}} wearer warm. Underwear may {{also be used to}} preserve the wearer's modesty – for instance, some women wear camisoles and slips (petticoats) under clothes that are sheer. Conversely, some types of underwear can be worn for sexual titillation, such as edible underwear, crotchless <b>panties</b> <b>and</b> thongs.|$|E
25|$|Pantyhose, {{also called}} tights in British English, which {{combined}} <b>panties</b> <b>and</b> hose into one garment, made their {{first appearance in}} 1959, invented by Glen Raven Mills of North Carolina. The company later introduced seamless pantyhose in 1965, spurred by {{the popularity of the}} miniskirt. By the end of the decade, the girdle had fallen out of favour as women chose sexier and lighter alternatives.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Panty</b> <b>and</b> Stocking's sidekick, a green dog-like creature, {{actually}} a restrained Bull Ghost, with zippers on his body, who closely resembles the character GIR from Invader Zim. Chuck {{is subject to}} mortal injuries {{throughout the course of}} the series, along with often unprovoked abuse from <b>Panty</b> <b>and</b> Stocking, quickly recovering each time. He can only be immobilized by opening the zippers on his head and releasing his brain, a 2-inch tall male demon who is romantically involved with Fastener's brain. He is used by Heaven as a mailbox of sorts, getting struck by lightning and spitting out a piece of paper containing a clue to a Ghost's whereabouts. By turning himself inside out, he can transform into a massive horned beast. He is only able to say his own name (which means a zipper in Japanese) and is capable of driving the Anarchy sisters' car, a pink Hummer called [...]|$|R
25|$|The hairs found upon Beineman's <b>panties</b> <b>and</b> those {{recovered}} from {{the basement of the}} Leik home were subjected to a detailed forensic neutron analysis to determine whether they had sourced from the same individuals.

25|$|Another bold {{move in the}} show's final months saw Number 96 feature {{what was}} publicised as Australian television's first full frontal nude scene when new {{character}} Miss Hemingway (Deborah Gray) made {{the first of several}} unveilings in April 1977. Number 96 in 1976 had shown a bit-part nurse fleeing Dudley's bedroom which revealed a full frontal nude flash {{but this was the first}} time such nudity was shown front and centre in protracted scenes. In one outrageous moment, Miss Hemingway wore a bra but no <b>panties</b> <b>and</b> yet despite screening at 8.30pm on free-to-air TV, there were barely any complaints (but when the same scene was shown on the ABC during Four Corners, the bottom of the screen was blacked out). Other bedroom farce comedy sequences of the period featured increasing levels of male and female semi-nudity, and some other instances of full frontal female nudity. Meanwhile, a scene where Jane Chester becomes a prostitute and is asked to whip her male client, new Number 96 resident Toby Buxton (Malcolm Thompson) gave viewers a brief glimpse of full frontal male nudity.|$|E

5000|$|Although it was [...] "one of {{the all-time}} great fads," [...] it was passé {{by the end of}} 1959, {{replaced}} by the more sedate fad of hunkerin'.

2500|$|The reverend of Daten City. He is the Anarchy sisters' guardian. Garterbelt is a {{large black}} man with a massive afro. He relays {{missions}} from Heaven to <b>Panty</b> <b>and</b> Stocking, and is constantly annoyed by their erratic behavior and lack of commitment to tasks at hand. Though vocal about keeping order in Daten City, he practices bondage and displays interest in young males, particularly Brief, and uses a masked alias called [...] "Master G" [...] to disguise himself while undertaking such hobbies. In his youth, he was a brutal thug who committed {{a wide array of}} crimes including robbery, prostitution, selling drugs and murder. When he is gunned down and sent to Heaven, God tasks him with finding the blood kin of Hell's Monkey, who possesses the key to unlocking Hell's Gate. Because of his initial refusal of the task, he is cursed with immortality and forbidden from dying until he fulfills his given task.

500|$|In 1992, Madonna {{released}} her controversial Sex book and her fifth studio album Erotica, both containing explicit sexual imagery {{and pictures of}} voyeuristic fantasies. She also starred in the erotic thriller Body of Evidence. During the same period, Madonna's appearance on David Letterman's talk show was noted for her controversial behavior. It included the singer using profanity that required censorship on television, and handing Letterman a pair of her <b>panties</b> <b>and</b> asking him to smell it. This made the episode the most censored in American network television talk-show history, {{while at the same}} time garnering the show some of the highest ratings it ever received. All releases were panned by critics and fans alike, calling Madonna a sexual renegade and claiming that [...] "she had gone too far" [...] and that her career was over. A song titled [...] "I'll Remember" [...] was included in the soundtrack of the film With Honors in early 1994. The song was well received by critics and was seen as Madonna's first positive step into reconnecting with the general public and repairing the damage that her provocative personality had caused to her career.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{continued}} her provocative imagery in the 1993 erotic thriller, Body of Evidence, a film which contained scenes of sadomasochism and bondage. It was poorly received by critics. She also {{starred in the}} film Dangerous Game, which was released straight to video in North America. The New York Times described the film as [...] "angry and painful, and the pain feels real." [...] In September 1993, Madonna embarked on The Girlie Show World Tour, in which she dressed as a whip-cracking dominatrix surrounded by topless dancers. In Puerto Rico she rubbed the island's flag between her legs on stage, resulting in outrage among the audience. In March 1994, she appeared as a guest on the Late Show with David Letterman, using profanity that required censorship on television, and handing Letterman a pair of her <b>panties</b> <b>and</b> asking him to smell it. The releases of her sexually explicit book, album and film, and the aggressive appearance on Letterman all made critics question Madonna as a sexual renegade. Critics and fans reacted negatively, who commented that [...] "she had gone too far" [...] and that her career was over.|$|E

500|$|Alexander O. Smith, {{who worked}} as a writer on the {{localization}} of the first Ace Attorney game, also worked on the localization of Apollo Justice. Localization of the game was already in progress by August 2007. The name [...] "Apollo Justice" [...] was decided in collaboration between the Japanese and American divisions of Capcom; it took them twenty-two meetings to decide on it. The name refers to how Apollo fights for justice. During the localization, there was some debate about {{the use of the word}} [...] "panties" [...] to describe Trucy's magical bloomers, a prop she uses in her magic shows; some on the localization team felt that it was inappropriate to joke about an underage girl's <b>panties,</b> <b>and</b> wanted them to be localized as [...] "magic pants", while some felt that the joke would be lost if the player already knew that they were massive bloomers. Janet Hsu, one of the staff members working on the localization, made an argument for [...] "emotional accuracy", saying that the Japanese version of the game was trying to make the player feel at unease over looking for what they might imagine to be [...] "sexy lingerie", and then let the player feel relief at finding out that it is a prop for a magic show. In the end, they were referred to as [...] "panties".|$|E
500|$|As the {{swimsuit}} was evolving, the underwear {{started to}} change. Between 1900 and 1940, swimsuit lengths followed {{the changes in}} underwear designs. In the 1920s women started discarding the corset, while the Cadole company of Paris started developing something they called the [...] "breast girdle". During the Great Depression, <b>panties</b> <b>and</b> bras became softly constructed and were made of various elasticized yarns making underwear fit like a second skin. By 1930s underwear styles for {{both women and men}} were influenced by the new brief models of swimwear from Europe. Although the waistband was still above the navel, the leg openings of the panty brief were cut in an arc to rise from the crotch to the hip joint. The brief served as a template for most all variations of panties {{for the rest of the}} century. Warner standardized the concept of Cup size in 1935. The first underwire bra was developed in 1938. Beginning in the late thirties skants, a type of skanty men's briefs, were introduced, featuring very high-cut leg openings and a lower rise to the waistband. Howard Hughes designed a push-up bra to be worn by Jane Russell in The Outlaw in 1943, although Russell stated in interviews that she never wore the 'contraption'. In 1950 Maidenform introduced the first official bust enhancing bra.|$|E

Each performance lasted for fifteen seconds and was modest by modern standards, incorporating veils, <b>panties</b> <b>and</b> a bra which covered much {{of what would be}} shown today. [...] The woman on stage stood in a stationary pose, similar to shows in Britain. The show ran until August 1948. [...] Theaters in Asakusa had fully nude displays, also featuring no motion or stripping. As this style of theater spread, the removal of clothing on stage was integrated into the process.|$|E
