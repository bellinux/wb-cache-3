25|$|<b>Prasterone</b> is {{sometimes}} {{used as an}} androgen in hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for menopause. In addition to <b>prasterone</b> itself, a long-lasting ester prodrug of <b>prasterone,</b> <b>prasterone</b> enanthate, is used in combination with estradiol valerate {{for the treatment of}} menopausal symptoms under the brand name Gynodian Depot.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, <b>prasterone</b> or <b>prasterone</b> sulfate {{have been}} advertised, under the names DHEA and DHEA-S, with claims {{that they may}} be {{beneficial}} {{for a wide variety of}} ailments. <b>Prasterone</b> and <b>prasterone</b> sulfate are readily available in the United States, where they are sold as over-the-counter dietary supplements.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{evidence}} <b>prasterone</b> is of benefit in treating or preventing cancer. Although <b>prasterone</b> is postulated as an inhibitor towards glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and suppresses leukemia cell proliferation in vitro, <b>Prasterone</b> may enhance G6PD mRNA expression, confounding its inhibitory effects.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not known}} whether <b>prasterone</b> is safe for {{long-term}} use. Some researchers believe <b>prasterone</b> supplements might actually raise {{the risk of breast}} cancer, prostate cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and stroke. <b>Prasterone</b> may stimulate tumor growth in types of cancer that are sensitive to hormones, such as some types of breast, uterine, and prostate cancer. <b>Prasterone</b> may increase prostate swelling in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), an enlarged prostate gland.|$|E
25|$|<b>Prasterone,</b> {{under the}} brand name Intrarosa, is {{approved}} in the United States in a vaginal insert formulation {{for the treatment of}} atrophic vaginitis (vaginal atrophy). The mechanism of action of <b>prasterone</b> for this indication is unknown, though it may involve local metabolism of <b>prasterone</b> into androgens and estrogens.|$|E
25|$|<b>Prasterone</b> is {{the generic}} name of DHEA in English and Italian and its , , and , while its generic name is {{prasteron}}um in Latin, <b>prastérone</b> in French and its , and prasteron in German.|$|E
25|$|A {{meta-analysis}} of intervention studies shows that <b>prasterone</b> supplementation in elderly men can induce {{a small but}} significant positive effect on body composition that is strictly dependent on <b>prasterone</b> conversion into its bioactive metabolites such as androgens or estrogens.|$|E
25|$|<b>Prasterone</b> may promote {{tamoxifen}} resistance. Patients on {{hormone replacement}} therapy may have more estrogen-related side effects when taking <b>prasterone.</b> This supplement may also interfere with other medicines, and potential interactions between it and drugs and herbs are possible.|$|E
25|$|A double-blind, {{placebo-controlled}} {{study in}} adult polydrug users in a detoxification program showed {{the efficacy of}} <b>prasterone</b> treatment combined with psychosocial enrichment and after-care. <b>Prasterone</b> administration positively affected decision-making, mood and well-being as early as one month into treatment, and had a long-lasting preventive effect on relapse to drug use. In a 16-month follow-up, relapse rates of prasterone-treated subjects were only 11.5%. No adverse symptoms were found. These findings demonstrate the long-term effect of <b>prasterone</b> on drug relapse.|$|E
25|$|<b>Prasterone</b> is {{produced}} naturally {{in the human}} body, but {{the long-term effects of}} its use are largely unknown. In the short term, several studies have noted few adverse effects. In a study by Chang et al., <b>prasterone</b> was administered at a dose of 200mg/day for 24 weeks with slight androgenic effects noted. Another study utilized a dose up to 400mg/day for 8 weeks with few adverse events reported. A longer term study followed patients dosed with 50mg of <b>prasterone</b> for 12 months with the number and severity of side effects reported to be small. Another study delivered a dose of 50mg of <b>prasterone</b> for 10 months with no serious adverse events reported.|$|E
25|$|<b>Prasterone,</b> {{also known}} as androst-5-en-3β-ol-17-one, is a {{naturally}} occurring androstane steroid and a 17-ketosteroid. It is closely related structurally to androstenediol (androst-5-ene-3β,17β-diol), androstenedione (androst-4-ene-3,17-dione), and testosterone (androst-4-en-17β-ol-3-one). <b>Prasterone</b> is the 5-dehydro analogue of epiandrosterone (5α-androstan-3β-ol-17-one) and is {{also known as}} 5-dehydroepiandrosterone or as δ5-epiandrosterone.|$|E
25|$|<b>Prasterone</b> {{is listed}} as an {{anabolic}} steroid and is thus a class C controlled drug.|$|E
25|$|Evidence is {{inconclusive}} {{in regards}} to the effect of <b>prasterone</b> on strength in the elderly.|$|E
25|$|As {{a hormone}} precursor, {{there have been}} reports of side effects {{possibly}} caused by the hormone metabolites of <b>prasterone.</b>|$|E
25|$|In middle-aged men, no {{significant}} effect of <b>prasterone</b> supplementation on lean body mass, strength, or testosterone levels {{was found in a}} randomized placebo-controlled trial.|$|E
25|$|<b>Prasterone</b> is {{possibly}} unsafe for individuals experiencing pregnancy, breastfeeding, hormone sensitive conditions, liver problems, diabetes, depression or mood disorders, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), or cholesterol problems.|$|E
25|$|In Canada, <b>prasterone</b> is a Controlled Drug {{listed under}} Section 23 of Schedule IV of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act {{and as such}} is {{available}} by prescription only.|$|E
25|$|A few small, {{short term}} {{clinical}} {{studies have found}} that <b>prasterone</b> improves mood but its long-term efficacy and safety, and how it compares to antidepressants, was unknown as of 2015.|$|E
25|$|A {{review in}} 2003 found the then-extant {{evidence}} sufficient {{to suggest that}} low serum levels of DHEA-S {{may be associated with}} coronary heart disease in men, but insufficient to determine whether <b>prasterone</b> supplementation would have any cardiovascular benefit.|$|E
25|$|<b>Prasterone</b> supplementation has {{not been}} found to be useful for memory {{function}} in normal middle aged or older adults. It has been studied as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease, but {{there is no evidence that}} it is effective.|$|E
25|$|DHEA and DHEA sulfate are {{produced}} by the adrenal glands. In people with adrenal insufficiency such as in Addison's disease, there may be deficiency of DHEA and DHEA sulfate. In addition, levels of these steroids decrease throughout life and are 70 to 80% lower in the elderly relative to levels in young adults. As such, DHEA and DHEA sulfate levels are also lower in older people. <b>Prasterone</b> {{can be used to}} increase DHEA and DHEA sulfate levels in adrenal insufficiency and older age. Although there is deficiency of these steroids in such individuals, clinical benefits of supplementation, if any, are uncertain, and there is insufficient evidence at present to support the use of <b>prasterone</b> for such purposes.|$|E
25|$|At a {{high dosage}} of 1,600mg/day orally for 4weeks, {{treatment}} of postmenopausal women with <b>prasterone</b> {{has been found}} to increase serum levels of DHEA by 15-fold, testosterone by 9-fold, DHEA-S, androstenedione (A4), and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) all by 20-fold, and estrone and estradiol both by 2-fold.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Prasterone</b> is a {{prohibited}} substance {{under the}} World Anti-Doping Code of the World Anti-Doping Agency, which manages drug testing for Olympics and other sports. In January 2011, NBA player O. J. Mayo {{was given a}} 10-game suspension after testing positive for <b>prasterone.</b> Mayo termed his use of <b>prasterone</b> as [...] "an honest mistake," [...] saying the <b>prasterone</b> was in an over-the-counter supplement {{and that he was}} unaware the supplement was banned by the NBA. Mayo is the seventh player to test positive for performance-enhancing drugs since the league began testing in 1999. Rashard Lewis, then with the Orlando Magic, tested positive for <b>prasterone</b> and was suspended 10 games {{before the start of the}} 2009-10 season. 2008 Olympic 400 meter champion Lashawn Merritt has also tested positive for <b>prasterone</b> and was banned from the sport for 21 months. Yulia Efimova, who holds the world record pace for both the 50-meter and 200-meter breaststroke, and won the bronze medal in the 200-meter breaststroke in the 2012 London Olympic Games, tested positive for <b>prasterone</b> in an out-of-competition doping test. In 2016 MMA fighter Fabio Maldonado revealed he was taking <b>prasterone</b> during his time with the UFC.|$|E
2500|$|In {{clinical}} studies of <b>prasterone</b> supplementation, dosages {{have ranged from}} 20 to 1,600mg per day. In people with adrenal insufficiency, oral dosages of 20 to 50mg/day <b>prasterone</b> {{have been found to}} restore DHEA and DHEA-S levels to normal ranges seen in healthy young adults. Conversely, oral dosages of 100 to 200mg/day <b>prasterone</b> have been found to result in [...] levels of DHEA and DHEA-S.|$|E
2500|$|In Australia, a {{prescription}} {{is required to}} buy <b>prasterone,</b> where it is also comparatively expensive compared to off-the-shelf purchases in US supplement shops. Australian customs classify <b>prasterone</b> as an [...] "anabolic steroid or precursor" [...] and, as such, it is only possible to carry <b>prasterone</b> into the country through customs if one possesses an import permit which may be obtained if one has a valid prescription for the hormone.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Prasterone</b> {{is legal}} {{to sell in}} the United States as a dietary supplement. It is {{currently}} grandfathered in as an [...] "Old Dietary Ingredient" [...] being on sale prior to 1994. <b>Prasterone</b> is specifically exempted from the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 1990 and 2004.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Prasterone,</b> {{also known}} as {{dehydroepiandrosterone}} (DHEA), is a naturally occurring steroid which {{is used as a}} supplement and medication. It is an androstane derivative and a precursor of steroid hormones like testosterone and estradiol. <b>Prasterone</b> has weak androgenic activity, weak estrogenic activity, and neurosteroid activity, and acts as a prohormone of androgens and estrogens depending on its [...] and route of administration. As a medication, <b>prasterone</b> may be used to restore or increase DHEA levels in deficiency or old age, for menopausal women as a weak androgen or to treat vaginal atrophy, and, in its sulfate form, for cervical dilation during childbirth.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Prasterone</b> is a steroid hormone. High doses {{may cause}} aggressiveness, irritability, trouble sleeping, {{and the growth}} of body or facial hair on women. It also may stop {{menstruation}} and lower the levels of HDL ("good" [...] cholesterol), which could raise the risk of heart disease. Other reported side effects include acne, heart rhythm problems, liver problems, hair loss (from the scalp), and oily skin. It may also alter the body's regulation of blood sugar.|$|E
