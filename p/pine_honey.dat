40|$|Coffee aroma, {{with more}} than 600 components, is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most complex food aromas. Although electronic noses have been successfully used for objective analysis and differentiation of total coffee aromas, it is difficult to use them to describe the specific features of coffee aroma (i. e., the type of smell).

In this paper, we present an electronic nose that is capable of learning the wine related aromas using the aroma kit “Le Nez du Vin,” and the potential to describe coffee aroma in a similar manner comparable to how wine experts describe wine aroma.

40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Florestal e dos Recursos Naturais - Instituto Superior de Agronomia - ULThe {{interest}} in sustainable development and environmental management from {{non-wood forest products}} (NWFPs) has been growing during the past decade. These products are important in the bio-economy especially in regions where wood {{is not the most}} profitable product. As NWFPs cover a wide range of species they provide an array of alternatives to use more green products and are a relevant component of sustainable forest management. We present an approach to characterize the potential of most promising NWFPs in the Alentejo region. We used the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), one of many multi-criteria decision making methods, and a Delphi approach to support judgments collected from stakeholders and domain experts. In order to facilitate and manage the pairwise comparisons in the application of the AHP we selected seven regional NWFPs: boletus (Boletus edulis), cork (Quercus suber), pine nuts (Pinus pinea), pine resin (Pinus spp), yellow lavender (Lavandula viridis), honey from bees (Apis mellifera), and rabbit as game meat (Oryctolagus cuniculus). AHP incorporated the judgments (weights) from experts along a hierarchical decomposition of the problem into a set of criteria and sub-criteria, and generated a regionally explicit ranking of alternatives (NWFPs) by deriving priorities. The three NWFPs with the highest potential were cork, pine nuts and yellow lavender. In a second level of importance were boletus, <b>pine</b> resin, <b>honey</b> and rabbit. These results further reinforce that cork is the product with the greatest potential in Alentejo region. However, yellow lavender has a significant potential and could be an interesting opportunity for forest owners that aim diversifying the basket of products supplied. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the model is robust because the ranking of NWFPs did not change much with the weights of criteria. This model also provides forest owners with information to develop management strategies or to engage in related NWFPs businesse...|$|R

Three of them were fed extra with pollen+water, pollen and water. The control colonies were not given additive foods. Honey yield in pollen+water, pollen, water and control groups were found to be 24. 2 ± 1. 1, 17. 3 ± 0. 8, 16. 3 ± 1. 0 and 12. 0 ± 0. 6 kg/colony respectively.

A range of treatments with antimicrobial properties, including impregnated dressings, are widely used {{in the treatment of}} pressure ulcers. A clear and current overview is required to facilitate decision making regarding use of antiseptic or antibiotic therapies in the treatment of pressure ulcers. This review is one of a suite of Cochrane reviews investigating the use of antiseptics and antibiotics in different types of wounds. It also forms part of a suite of reviews investigating the use of different types of dressings and topical treatments in the treatment of pressure ulcers. Objectives: To assess the effects of systemic and topical antibiotics, and topical antiseptics on the healing of infected and uninfected pressure ulcers being treated in any clinical setting. Search methods: In October 2015 we searched: the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations), Ovid EMBASE, and EBSCOCINAHL Plus. We also searched three clinical trials registries and the references of included studies and relevant systematic reviews. There were no restrictions based on language or date of publication or study setting. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials which enrolled adults with pressure ulcers of stage II or above were included in the review. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. Main results: We included 12 trials (576 participants); 11 had two arms and one had three arms. All assessed topical agents, none looked at systemic antibiotics. The included trials assessed the following antimicrobial agents: povidone iodine, cadexomer iodine, gentian violet, lysozyme, silver dressings, <b>honey,</b> <b>pine</b> resin, polyhexanide, silver sulfadiazine, and nitrofurazone with ethoxy-diaminoacridine. Comparators included a range of other dressings and ointments without antimicrobial properties and alternative antimicrobials. Each comparison had only one trial, participant numbers were low and follow-up times short. The evidence varied from moderate to very low quality. Six trials reported the primary outcome of wound healing. All except one compared an antiseptic with a non-antimicrobial comparator. There was some moderate and low quality evidence that fewer ulcers may heal in the short term when treated with povidone iodine compared with non-antimicrobial alternatives (protease-modulating dressings (risk ratio (RR) 0. 78, 95...|$|R
