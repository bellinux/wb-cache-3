As a child, Reubens frequented the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, whose winter headquarters was in Sarasota. The circus's atmosphere sparked Reubens' interest in entertainment and influenced his later work. Reubens also loved to watch reruns of I Love Lucy, which made him want to make <b>people</b> <b>laugh.</b> At age five, Reubens asked his father to build him a stage, where he and his siblings would put on plays.|$|E

25|$|A Buddhist priest {{ascribed}} the “wisdom of zen”, {{his life}} is consumed with an obsession over his nose, which dangles past his mouth at {{about five or six}} inches.

When he finds a method to shorten his nose, he becomes flippant when <b>people</b> <b>laugh</b> at his vanity. Eventually, when his nose grows back, he rejoices in his condition.|$|E

25|$|At {{the castle}} of Doris, {{preparations}} {{are under way}} for the celebrations of the young countess Raymonda’s name day. Countess Sybille, her aunt, chides those who are present, including Raymonda's two friends Henrietta and Clémence, and the two troubadours Béranger and Bernard, for their idleness and their passion for dancing, telling them of the legendary White Lady, the protector of the castle, who warns the Doris household every time one of its members is in danger and casts punishment on {{those who do not}} fulfil their duties. The young <b>people</b> <b>laugh</b> at the countess’s superstitions and continue to celebrate. The seneschal of the Doris castle announces the arrival of a messenger, sent by Raymonda's fiancé, the noble crusader knight, Jean de Brienne, bearing a letter for his beloved. Raymonda rejoices when she reads that King Andre II of Hungary, for whom Jean de Brienne has fought, is returning home in triumph and Jean de Brienne will arrive at the Doris castle the next day for their wedding. Suddenly, the celebrations are interrupted when the seneschal announces the arrival of an uninvited Saracen knight, Abderakhman and his entourage, who have stopped at the castle seeking shelter for the night. Captivated by Raymonda's beauty, Abderakhman falls in love with her at once and resolves to do anything to win her. The party lasts late into the night and, left alone and exhausted by the day, Raymonda lies down on a couch and falls asleep. As she sleeps, she begins to dream that the White Lady appears illuminated by the moonlight and, with an imperious gesture, orders Raymonda to follow her.|$|E
500|$|Blumenfeld {{was born}} in Afula, Israel, and moved to Los Angeles {{at the age of}} two with his parents and two older brothers—his family is Reform Jewish.

500|$|Skelton {{preferred}} {{to be described}} as a clown rather than a comic: [...] "A comedian goes out and hits people right on. [...] A clown uses pathos. [...] He can be funny, then turn right around and reach people and touch them with what life is like." [...] "I just want to be known as a clown", he said, [...] "because to me that's the height of my profession. It means you can do everything—sing, dance and above all, make people laugh." [...] His purpose in life, he believed, was to make <b>people</b> <b>laugh.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hostile {{attribution}} bias, or hostile {{attribution of}} intent, is {{the tendency to}} interpret others' behaviors as having hostile intent, even when the behavior is ambiguous or benign.

500|$|According to Townshend, Moon began {{destroying}} {{hotel rooms}} when the Who {{stayed at the}} Berlin Hilton on tour in late 1966. In addition to hotel rooms, Moon destroyed friends' homes and even his own, throwing furniture from upper-storey windows and lighting fires. Andrew Neill and Matthew Kent estimated that his destruction of hotel toilets and plumbing {{cost as much as}} £300,000 ($500,000). These acts, often fuelled by drugs and alcohol, were Moon's way of demonstrating his eccentricity; he enjoyed shocking the public with them. Longtime friend and personal assistant Butler observed, [...] "He was trying to make <b>people</b> <b>laugh</b> and be Mr Funny, he wanted people to love him and enjoy him, but he would go so far. Like a train ride you couldn't stop." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} made {{in an attempt to}} {{challenge}} the [...] "no pressure" [...] attitude often displayed both by governments and individuals towards taking real action on climate change. 10:10 highlighted the urgency of action with claims that carbon dioxide emissions must be stabilised by 2014 (within four years) in order to avoid disaster, and that [...] "300,000 real people" [...] are already killed by climate change annually. Lizzie Gillet, 10:10 global campaign director, explained: [...] "With climate change becoming increasingly threatening, and decreasingly talked about in the media, we wanted {{to find a way to}} bring this critical issue back into the headlines while making <b>people</b> <b>laugh.</b> We were therefore delighted when Richard Curtis agreed to write a short film for the 10:10 campaign".|$|E

500|$|In 1935 Bush {{began work}} on a piano concerto which, {{completed}} in 1937, included the unusual feature of a mixed chorus and baritone soloist in the finale, singing a radical text by Randall Swingler. Bush played the piano part when the work was premiered by the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Sir Adrian Boult on 4 March 1938. The largely left-wing audience responded to the work enthusiastically; Tippett observed that [...] "to counter the radical tendencies of the finale ... Boult forced the applause to end by unexpectedly performing the National Anthem". [...] A performance of the concerto a year later, at the 1939 [...] "Festival of Music for the People", drew caustic comments from [...] Neville Cardus in [...] The Manchester Guardian. [...] Cardus saw little direction and no humour in the music: [...] "Why don't these <b>people</b> <b>laugh</b> at themselves now and then? Just for fun." ...|$|E
500|$|Hartman {{was widely}} mourned in Hollywood. NBC {{executive}} Don Ohlmeyer stated that Hartman [...] "was {{blessed with a}} tremendous gift for creating characters that made <b>people</b> <b>laugh.</b> Everyone who {{had the pleasure of}} working with Phil knows that {{he was a man of}} tremendous warmth, a true professional and a loyal friend." [...] Guttenberg expressed shock at Hartman's death, and Steve Martin said he was [...] "a deeply funny and very happy person." [...] Matt Groening called him [...] "a master", and director Joe Dante said, [...] "He was one of those guys who was a dream to work with. I don't know anybody who didn't like him." [...] Dan Snierson of Entertainment Weekly concluded that Hartman was [...] "the last person you'd expect to read about in lurid headlines in your morning paper" [...] and [...] "a decidedly regular guy, beloved by everyone he worked with." [...] In 2007, Entertainment Weekly ranked Hartman the 87th greatest television icon of all time, and Maxim named Hartman the top Saturday Night Live performer of all time.|$|E
500|$|Professional wrestler Bret Hart guest {{starred in}} the episode as himself, {{and he was very}} insistent that he be shown wearing his pink wrestling outfit.

[...] The media, aware that the animated Hart would want to purchase Mr. Burns' home, mistakenly anticipated that [...] "Bret offers to wrestle him [...] for the place." [...] In a 2009 interview with the A.V. Club's Dave Hofer, Hart explained that the reason why his animated counterpart sounds nothing like him was that initially, he was brought in to voice a generic wrestler. When Mark Kirkland realised how famous Hart actually was, he told Hart that if the artwork had not been started yet, he would be drawn in as himself. Later, Hart moved on to do voice work on the animated television series Jacob Two-Two. The press noted that at that time Hart was [...] "no stranger to cartoon-land," [...] having been [...] "immortalized" [...] by [...] "The Old Man and the Lisa".|$|E

500|$|Barker {{became a}} comic actor in his theatre days, noting [...] "I think it's better to make <b>people</b> <b>laugh</b> than cry." [...] He has been {{described}} by The Times as [...] "not a comedian, [...] an actor with a talent for comedy," [...] who [...] "slipped into characters with apparent ease." [...] Barker felt he was funny only in character. The BBC wrote of him: [...] "Able to deliver the great tongue-twisting speeches required of his characters, Barker pronounced himself 'completely boring' without a script." [...] Peter Hall spoke of Barker's skills as a dramatic actor, calling him [...] "the great actor we lost" [...] and lamented that Barker was unable to take a role in one of his Shakespearean productions. Barker, though, preferred comedy, and felt it was [...] "as good and as important as serious work" [...] and he was not [...] "dumbing down" [...] by doing it. Actor Gene Wilder compared him to Charlie Chaplin in saying [...] "no matter how farcical [...] was ... there was always an element of reality to what he did." [...] Corbett praised Barker's skill at playing serious authority figures saying absurd things, using Barker's verbal dexterity and energetic performances.|$|E
500|$|Skelton {{discovered}} {{at an early}} age that he could make <b>people</b> <b>laugh.</b> Skelton dropped out of school around 1926 or 1927, when he was 13 or 14 years old, but he already had some experience performing in minstrel shows in Vincennes, and on a showboat, [...] "The Cotton Blossom", that plied the Ohio and Missouri rivers. He enjoyed his work on the riverboat, moving on only after he realized that showboat entertainment was coming to an end. Skelton, who was interested in all forms of acting, took a dramatic role with the John Lawrence stock theater company, but was unable to deliver his lines in a serious manner; the audience laughed instead. In another incident, while performing in Uncle Tom's Cabin, Skelton was on an unseen treadmill; when it malfunctioned and began working in reverse, the frightened young actor called out, [...] "Help! I'm backing into heaven!" [...] He was fired before completing a week's work in the role. At the age of 15, Skelton did some early work on the burlesque circuit, and reportedly spent four months with the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus in 1929, when he was 16 years old.|$|E
500|$|After {{attending}} {{an industry}} screening in April 2008 Michael Cieply from The New York Times {{stated that the}} film was [...] "...shaping up as one of 's best prospects for the summer." [...] Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film a positive review, writing [...] "There are some wildly funny scenes, a few leaden ones and others that are scattershot, with humorous satire undercut by over-the-top grisliness. Still, when it's funny, it's really funny." [...] A review in Variety by Todd McCarthy was critical: [...] "Apart from startling, out-there comic turns by Robert Downey Jr. and Tom Cruise, however, the antics here are pretty thin, redundant and one-note." [...] Rick Groen of The Globe and Mail gave the film a negative review, calling it [...] "...an assault {{in the guise of}} a comedy—watching it is like getting mugged by a clown." [...] J.R. Jones of Chicago Reader stated [...] "The rest of the movie never lives up to the hilarity of the opening, partly because the large-scale production smothers the gags but mostly because those gags are so easy to smother." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave 3.5/4 and wrote, [...] "The movie is, may I say, considerably better than Stiller’s previous film, Zoolander (2001). It’s the kind of summer comedy that rolls in, makes a lot of <b>people</b> <b>laugh</b> and rolls on to video." ...|$|E

500|$|Barker {{failed to}} get into the Young Vic School, but joined the Manchester Repertory Company, which was based in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, often taking comic roles in their weekly shows. Initially he was {{employed}} as the assistant to the assistant stage manager, earning £2.10s.0d (£2.50) a week. He made his debut as a professional actor on 15 November 1948 as Lieutenant Spicer in a performance of J.M. Barrie's Quality Street. He went on to play the organist in When We Are Married and by his third role, the chauffeur Charles in Miranda, Barker realised {{he wanted to be a}} comic actor. He was described as [...] "ha the talent to be a great straight actor", but noted: [...] "I want to make <b>people</b> <b>laugh.</b> Never mind about Hamlet. Forget Richard the Second. Give me Charley's Aunt. My mission in life was now crystal clear." [...] He appeared in stage adaptations of Treasure Island and Red Riding Hood before getting his first leading role in The Guinea Pig as a working class boy at a public school. When the production moved to Rhyl, Barker followed. The Manchester Repertory Company closed, as did the Rhyl company shortly after. Barker, aged 20, then spent some time as a porter at Wingfield Hospital; he became distressed through his contact with polio patients and so opted to take on the persona of [...] "Charlie" [...] so as not to be himself. He and a male nurse often entertained the patients with comedy routines. He found work at the Mime Theatre Company, performing mimed folk music and dance, which soon folded in Penzance. He made his way back to Oxford and then worked in Bramhall for the Famous Players. There he met actor Glenn Melvyn; the two became firm friends and Barker stated Melvyn taught him everything he [...] "ever learned about comedy." ...|$|E
500|$|Krusty the Clown, born Herschel Shmoikel Pinchas Yerucham Krustofski, {{was born}} in the Lower East Side of Springfield and is the son of Hyman Krustofski. Very little is known about his mother, aside from her name being Rachel and that she died when Krusty was around thirteen. Hyman {{strongly}} opposed Krusty's wish to become a clown and make <b>people</b> <b>laugh,</b> believing that it would distract him from his religion, wanting the boy to go to yeshiva instead. However, Krusty performed slapstick comedy behind his father's back. One day, he was performing at a rabbis' convention when one joking rabbi squirted seltzer on him, washing off his clown makeup. When Rabbi Krustofski found out, he disowned his son, and did not speak to him for 25 years. Krusty was later reconciled with his father with the assistance of Bart and Lisa Simpson. It was later revealed that Krusty did not have a Bar Mitzvah service, because Hyman feared he would violate the sanctity of the rites by [...] "acting up". Krusty had two adult Bar Mitzvah ceremonies: a Hollywood gala which Krusty uses to stage a comeback after his show is cancelled, then a simple ceremony intended to reconnect with his father. After leaving the Lower East Side of Springfield, Krusty started his show biz career as a street mime in Tupelo, Mississippi. (a reference to Elvis Presley's birthplace) Krusty later discovered that he has a daughter named Sophie. He had met Sophie's mother when she served as a soldier in the Gulf War and he was entertaining the troops. After spending the night together, he prevented her from assassinating Saddam Hussein to protect his Saddam-themed comedy act. After that she started hating clowns, and kept their daughter a secret from Krusty. Krusty and Sophie bonded over time, and while not a full-time father, he is known to keep up with her birthdays and to also make occasional in-show references to 'my daughter'.|$|E
