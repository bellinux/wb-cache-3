50|$|Despite the benefits, {{the ability}} to control a packet capture {{appliance}} from a remote machine presents a security issue that could make the appliance vulnerable. Packet capture appliances that allow remote access should have a robust system in place to protect it against unauthorized access. One way to accomplish this is to incorporate a manual disable, such as a switch or toggle that allows the user to <b>physically</b> <b>disable</b> remote access. This simple solution is very effective, as it is doubtful that a hacker would have an easy time gaining physical access to the appliance in order to flip a switch.|$|R

In this paper, we propose protocols that increase the dependability of wireless sensor networks, which are potentially useful building blocks in cyberphysical systems.

Our advanced protocols resist strong adversaries that can physically compromise some nodes. ...|$|R

There is no evidence-based approach for treating existing TD but several clinical interventions can be effective including discontinuing the antipsychotics or reducing the dosage, switching to clozapine, adding an antidyskinetic agent, or applying deep brain stimulation...|$|R

5|$|The NSDAP was a far-right {{political}} party which came {{into its own}} during the social and financial upheavals that occurred {{with the onset of}} the Great Depression in 1929. While in prison after the failed Beer Hall Putsch of 1923, Hitler wrote Mein Kampf, which laid out his plan for transforming German society into one based on race. The ideology of Nazism brought together elements of antisemitism, racial hygiene and eugenics and combined them with pan-Germanism and territorial expansionism with the goal of obtaining more Lebensraum for the Germanic people. The regime attempted to obtain this new territory by attacking Poland and the Soviet Union, intending to deport or kill the Jews and Slavs living there, who were viewed as being inferior to the Aryan master race and part of a Jewish Bolshevik conspiracy. The Nazi regime believed that only Germany could defeat the forces of Bolshevism and save humanity from world domination by International Jewry. Others deemed life unworthy of life by the Nazis included the mentally and <b>physically</b> <b>disabled,</b> Romani people, homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses and social misfits.|$|E
