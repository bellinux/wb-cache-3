40|$|Learning to {{converge}} to an efficient, i. e., Pareto-optimal Nash equilibrium of the repeated game {{is an open}} problem in multiagent learning. Our goal is to facilitate the learning of efficient outcomes in repeated plays of incomplete information games when only opponent’s actions but not its payoffs are observable. We use a two-stage protocol that allows a player to unilaterally commit to an action, allowing the other player to choose an action knowing the action chosen by the committed player. The motivation behind commitment is to promote trust between the players and prevent them from mutually harmful choices made to preclude worst-case outcomes. Our agents learn whether commitment is beneficial or not. Interestingly, the decision to commit {{can be thought of}} as expanding the action space and our proposed protocol can be incorporated by any learning strategies used for playing repeated games. We show the improvement of the outcome efficiency of standard learning algorithms when using our <b>proposed</b> <b>commitment</b> protocol. We propose convergence to pareto optimal Nash equilibrium of repeated games as desirable learning outcomes. The performance evaluation in this paper uses a similarly motivated metric that measures the percentage of Nash equilibria for repated games that dominate the observed outcome...|$|E

Meanings of the terms range indiscriminately over belief and behavior. Commitment is defined for this study as that attitude which ties someone to a thing or an act; {{in the case of}} a worker, it ties the worker to the work setting. Involvement is a broader word which includes both commitment and participation. A questionnaire modified from a scale generated by an international consortium, the Work Importance Study, was mailed to 400 subjects chosen in equal numbers from four groups: male nurses, female nurses, male engineers, and female engineers. Subjects reported commitment and participation in relation to five types of work: organization, job, work, occupation, and career. Factor analysis showed four factors for the scale: Professional Involvement, Work Commitment, Work Participation, and Organizational Involvement. Using analysis of variance, the independent variable, sex, showed close to total chance correlation with the dependent variables originally <b>proposed,</b> <b>commitment,</b> participation, and five types of work, and with the four loaded factors. Analysis of variance for profession was significant for the four factors. Difference analysis suggested three types of work emerging in the scale: organization, work, and profession. Suggestions for further research are made, citing the possibility of building intervention strategies on the results. The new questionnaire should be administered to workers in different occupations and to unionized employees. ...|$|E

40|$|This exploratory, {{qualitative}} study examines {{the experience of}} marital commitment for men during a difficult time in their marriage. Interviews with eleven married men were systematically conducted and analyzed utilizing the constant comparative method. All of these men were currently satisfied in their marriages but recalled {{a period of time}} when they experienced severe difficulties in the relationship with their spouse. The semi-structured interviews revolved around their commitment rationale during this especially difficult time. ^ Three major themes emerged in this study of commitment rationale. The men were influenced to stay in their marriages during difficult times by Attraction-Based elements of rationale, characterized by their attraction to their partner, the relationship, or marriage identity; Higher-Order elements of rationale, characterized by adherence to moral and philosophical principles related to the institution of marriage, obligation to wife or children, personal accountability, and beliefs about spiritual growth through challenge; and Structural elements of rationale, characterized by the men 2 ̆ 7 s more basic orientation to the world as it related to their personality, wariness of alternatives, social pressure, parental modeling, and sense of investment. ^ For most of these men, the Higher-Order elements of rationale seemed to be the most salient during their marital struggle.

The objective of this component of the research programme was to examine the long-term goals and perceived influences on final year dental students' professional careers. Methods Univariate analysis of a self completed questionnaire survey of all final year dental students from King's College London, comprising questions on demography, long-term career goals and influences, <b>proposed</b> <b>commitment</b> to dentistry, commitment to healthcare systems and the influences thereon. Statistical analysis included Chi Squared tests for linear association. Results Ninety per cent of students responded to this survey (n = 126), the majority of whom were aged 23 years (59 %), female (58 %) and Asian (70 %). Long-term career goals were fairly evenly split between 'dentist with a special interest' (27 %), 'primary dental care practitioner' (26 %) and 'specialist' (25 %), with 19 % not certain. Only 60 % of total respondents anticipated working full-time in the long-term (79 % males cf 52 % females; p = 0. 00). The vast majority of respondents (≥ 80 %) identified 'work-life balance', 'financial stability' and 'professional development' as 'important' or 'very important' influences on the number of future sessions. Females {{were significantly more likely to}} rate childcare commitments as an important influence on their future working capacity compared with males (p = 0. 00). A wide range of factors were considered important or very important in making the NHS attractive, led by support for professional development (88 %) and feeling valued by patients (88 %), as well as funding, time with patients, rewards for prevention and practical issues such as dental materials and premises. Females were significantly more likely than males to be attracted to work within the NHS by 'childcare support' (p = 0. 02), 'retraining facilities after career break' (p = 0. 01), 'assistance with student debt' (p = 0. 01) and 'incentives to work in deprived areas'. Conclusion Long-term career plans of new graduates from this London Dental School commonly embrace opportunities for professional development as well as personal issues such as work/life balance and financial income. Significant differences were identified between male and females long-term plans and influences. The implications of these findings are discussed. </p...|$|E
40|$|In April the European Commission {{adopted a}} {{recommendation}} for Council Decision encompassing draft directives for {{the negotiation of}} economic partnership agreements with ACP countries. These draft negotiating directives are now under discussion with EU member States, primarily {{under the auspices of}} the Article 133 Committee, which deals with external trade relations of the EU. The explanatory memorandum to the recommendation for a Council Decision dealt with: the relationship of economic partnership agreement negotiations to the wider objectives of the Cotonou Agreement; the proposed content of economic partnership agreements; the principles which should guide the establishment of economic partnership agreements; the relationship to WTO rules; the need to support regional market integration amongst ACP countries; how the concept of differentiation is to be applied, particularly with reference to least developed countries; the overall objectives of economic partnership agreements both with reference to trade relations and the wider economic and social development of ACP countries. The draft negotiating directives set out: the relationship to the Cotonou Agreement; the proposed scope of economic partnership agreements; how negotiations on trade in goods are to be dealt with; the scope and how negotiations on trade in services are to be dealt with; the scope of negotiations on trade related areas; how payments and capital movements are to be dealt with; the institutional framework for negotiations; the structure and organisation of negotiations. Overall the most important points are that: EPAs are to be subject to the wider development objectives of the Cotonou Agreement; the various EPAs to be negotiated are to be as similar as possible; the main aim of EPAs is to establish 'a stable, predictable and transparent framework for economic and trade relations between the ACP countries and the EU'; EPAs will involve 'progressively eliminating tariffs and non-tariff barriers'; the European Commission recognised that adjustment costs would be faced but felt that the necessary flanking measures could be financed from existing EDF instruments; the trade in goods provisions of EPAs should by in conformity with Article XXIV of GATT; the trade in services provision of EPAs should conform with the provisions of GATT; the provisions of EPSs on trade related areas (investment, public procurement, standards and data protection) should be consistent with WTO provisions; regional market integration should be supported; the concept of differentiation does not imply LDCs would retain their rights to non-reciprocal trade preferences. LDCs would be expected to waive their right to continued non-reciprocal preferences under any region to region EPAs; regional based EPA negotiations should begin no later than January 2003. Comment: With specific regard to the agricultural sector a number of significant points emerged. The agricultural sector (and associated downstream value added product industries) is the major area where the EU retains market access restrictions. Here the Commission's final draft mandate is less forthcoming on issues of market access than the preliminary draft mandate. Initially the Commission proposed that: 'the Community should grant duty free access to its markets to all products originating in the ACP countries, as from entry into force of EPAs. ' In the final Commission-approved draft, the commitment on market access for ACP countries is restricted to an expression of belief that: 'The Community should further improve current access to its markets for products originating in the ACP countries'. This is believed to be the result of pressure from DG Agriculture which is fearful that the process of CAP reform will not be completed by 2008 and that, as a consequence, opening up the agricultural sector to all ACP exports by 2008 could create problems for EU agriculture. Significantly, in section 3. 2 of the actual Directives annexed to the recommendation for a Council Decision, while talking about how: 'EPAs shall build upon and further enhance the market access conditions currently provided under the Cotonou Agreement' for ACP countries this is only to be 'fixed in the course of the negotiations'. Overall the Commission's final mandate appears to take a much harder line on market access than the initial draft, with the view being expressed that: 'trade liberalisation in favour of developing countries should be part of a new North-South partnership according to which these countries apply the appropriate policies'. Clearly, within this Commission approach, further opening up of the EU market is to be made conditional on ACP countries applying these 'appropriate policies'. There would appear to be an urgent need for the EU Council of Ministers to reinstate the Commission's initially <b>proposed</b> <b>commitment</b> to 'grant duty free access to its markets to all products originating in the ACP countries, as from entry into force of EPAs. ' This would provide a more solid basis for investment in the value added food product industries of ACP countries. This could bring real benefits to ACP countries in the context of their participation in the larger integrated economic area centred on the EU which EPAs are designed to bring about. From an agricultural perspective a further important area of the EU's negotiating instructions is the requirement for ACP countries to open up their economies to duty free imports from the EU. This needs to be seen in the context of the reform of the CAP which, on the basis of increased levels of direct aid payments to EU farmers, is making EU exports of basic agricultural products and value added food products more price competitive on overseas markets. Significantly the Commission draft negotiating directives make no provision for discussion of the external effects of CAP reform on ACP countries. This is a major shortcoming in the negotiating instructions from an ACP perspective. The only provision made is for 'appropriate flexibility... in the product coverage and the calendar rhythm of liberalisation commitments'. This being said, provision is made for safeguard provisions building on Article 8 of Annex V of the Cotonou Agreement. Anti-dumping measures are also to be allowed in accordance with GATT/WTO rules. Currently the only reference made to CAP distortions is in section 3. 2 of the negotiating directives which states: 'In this context the parties will examine on a case by case basis, the potential impact of export refund mechanisms on the process of trade liberalisation. ' Given the importance of agricultural trade (36 % ACP exports to the EU) to the ACP group, and the significance of agriculture within the production structures of many ACP economies, this oversight is potentially disastrous. The common agricultural policy is being reformed to enhance the competitiveness of EU agricultural and value added food product industries on national and international markets. This will undoubtedly have an impact on the market conditions facing ACP producers of similar or competing products. ACP and EU parliamentarians (see next item) have called for a comprehensive assessment of the likely implications for ACP countries of CAP reform. They say that future trade arrangements should be designed to: 'fully take into account the impact of the internal process of reform of the common agricultural policy on ACP countries and seek to minimise adverse effects on the development of agro-based value added processing activities in ACP countries. ' Clearly the importance of the external effects of a reformed CAP on the development of ACP-EU trade relations and ACP economies, needs to be recognised. Provision should be made within the European Commission's directives for these issues to be addressed during economic partnership agreement negotiations. In April the European Commission adopted a [...] ...|$|E

While transdifferentiation from one tissue type into another ('metaplasia') appears to be generally forbidden in nonpathological contexts, plasticity within an individual tissue stem cell hierarchy may be much more common than previously appreciated. In this review, we discuss recent examples of such plasticity in selected mammalian epithelia, highlighting the different modes of regeneration and their implications for our understanding of cellular hierarchy and tissue self-renewal...|$|R
40|$|Regional planning, {{regional}} policy and regional governance are contentious topics. There is debate about what properly constitutes a 'region', {{as there is}} about the form, role and scope of planning in and for regions. At the same time, the responsibility for regions and regional planning is currently spread across many levels of government as well as non-elected bodies. It is not surprising, then, that many in the planning community regard {{the current state of}} regional planning in Australia as unsatisfactory. Planners who <b>propose</b> a <b>commitment</b> to genuine spatial planning on the regional scale - that is, planning that attempts to integrate social, economic and environmental objectives for regions that are larger than local government areas and smaller than states - face a very significant challenge. To meet it, they must go beyond traditional land-use planning and regulation...|$|R
40|$|As net-load {{becomes less}} {{predictable}} {{there is a}} lot of pressure in changing decision models for power markets such that they account explicitly for future scenarios in making commitment decisions. This paper <b>proposes</b> to make <b>commitment</b> decisions using a dynamic multistage stochastic unit commitment formulation over a cohesive horizon that leverages a state-space model for the commitment variables. We study the problem of constructing scenario tree approximations for both original and residual stochastic process and evaluate our algorithms on scenario tree libraries derived from real net-load data...|$|R
40|$|Cryptographic {{protocol}} constructions {{based on}} hardware-assisted tokens is one fairly new topic {{of research in}} recent years. Physically Uncloneable Functions (PUFs) are hardware tokens having interesting properties such as unpredictable and non-programmable. Previous works have shown PUFs {{can be used to}} construct secure computation protocols such as Oblivious Transfer and Commitment in the Universal Composable Framework. In this work, we <b>propose</b> a UC-secure <b>commitment</b> scheme which has a uniqueness of not relying on Fuzzy Extractors, which can be seen in every construction in previous literature. ...|$|R
