5|$|Fodor is {{a member}} of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He has {{received}} numerous awards and honors: New York State Regent's Fellowship, Woodrow Wilson Fellowship (Princeton University), Chancellor Greene Fellow (Princeton University), Fulbright Fellowship (Oxford University), Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, and a Guggenheim Fellowship. He won the first Jean Nicod Prize for philosophy of mind and cognitive philosophy in 1993. His lecture series for the Prize, later published as a book by MIT Press in 1995, was titled The Elm and the Expert: Mentalese and Its Semantics. In 1996–1997, Fodor delivered the prestigious John Locke Lectures at the University of Oxford, titled Concepts: Where Cognitive Science Went Wrong, which went on to become his 1998 Oxford University <b>Press</b> <b>book</b> of the same name. He has also delivered the Patrick Romanell Lecture on Philosophical Naturalism (2004) and the Royce Lecture on Philosophy of Mind (2002) to the American Philosophical Association, of whose Eastern Division he has served as Vice President (2004–2005) and President (2005–2006). In 2005, he won the Mind & Brain Prize.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{authority}} {{on the design of}} the film was concept artist Albert Hurter. All designs used in the film, from characters' appearances to the look of the rocks in the background, had to meet Hurter's approval before being finalized. Two other concept artists— Ferdinand Hovarth and Gustaf Tenggren— also contributed to the visual style of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Hovarth developed a number of dark concepts for the film, although many other designs he developed were ultimately rejected by the Disney team as less easily translated into animation than Hurter's. Tenggren was used as a color stylist and to determine the staging and atmosphere of many of the scenes in the film, as his style borrowed from the likes of Arthur Rackham and John Bauer and thus possessed the European illustration quality that Walt Disney sought. He also designed the posters for the film and illustrated the <b>press</b> <b>book.</b> However, Hovarth didn't receive a credit for the film. Other artists to work on the film included Joe Grant, whose most significant contribution was the design for the Queen's Witch form.|$|E

25|$|He {{also set}} up his own {{publishing}} enterprise, Advent Press, which published work by himself and by younger writers he wanted to support. He learned printmaking and produced {{a good deal of}} original work, including an interesting set of images based on the plays of his old friend Beckett. His interest in visual art also led to some experiments in concrete poetry, most notably his 1966 Advent <b>Press</b> <b>book</b> Monster: A Concrete Poem. His work was championed by a number of younger Irish poets, especially Michael Smith and Trevor Joyce. These two published poetry, prose and translations by Coffey in their journal, The Lace Curtain and his Selected Poems (1971) from their New Writers Press imprint. This book was instrumental in helping establish his reputation as a leading Irish exponent of Modernist poetry. The appearance in 1991 of a major selection Poems and Versions 1929–1990 and his translations Poems from Mallarmé helped confirm his status as one of the leading Irish modernists. He {{died at the age of}} 89, and was buried in Southampton, England.|$|E

500|$|The comedian Jack Benny {{may have}} had an {{unbilled}} cameo role, as was claimed by a contemporary newspaper advertisement and in the Casablanca <b>press</b> <b>book.</b> When asked in his column [...] "Movie Answer Man", critic Roger Ebert first replied, [...] "It looks something like him.

500|$|When Sense and Sensibility was {{released}} in cinemas in the US, Town & Country published a six-page article entitled [...] "Jane Austen's England", which focused on the landscape and sites shown in the film. A <b>press</b> <b>book</b> released by the studio, as well as Thompson's published screenplay and diaries, listed all the filming locations and helped to boost tourism. Saltram House for instance was carefully promoted during the film's release, and saw a 57 percent increase in attendance. In 1996, JASNA's membership increased by fifty percent. The popularity of both Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice led to the BBC and ITV releasing their Austen adaptations from the 1970s and 1980s onto DVD.|$|E

500|$|Having {{previously}} championed Harrison's {{work since}} 1970, Rolling Stone {{would not change}} its unfavourable verdict on Dark Horse over the ensuing decades, and Harrison never completely forgave the magazine for the treatment he received during this period. In 2002, writing in the Rolling Stone <b>Press</b> <b>book</b> Harrison shortly after his death, Greg Kot approved of Dark Horses [...] "jazzier backdrops" [...] compared with Material World, but opined that Harrison's voice turned much of the album into an [...] "unintentionally comic exercise". In the same publication, Mikal Gilmore identified Dark Horse as [...] "one of Harrison's most fascinating works – a record about change and loss". Alan Clayson similarly writes of the interest factor of [...] "a non-Beatle, {{as well as an}} ex-Beatle in uncertain transition", and while classing the album as [...] "an artistic faux pas", describes [...] "It Is 'He' (Jai Sri Krishna)" [...] as [...] "wonderful" [...] and [...] "startling". Richard Ginell of AllMusic highlights [...] "Dark Horse" [...] and the [...] "exquisite" [...] Harrison–Wood composition [...] "Far East Man".|$|E
