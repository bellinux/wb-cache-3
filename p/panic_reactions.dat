5|$|<b>Panic</b> <b>reactions</b> {{can occur}} after {{consumption}} of psilocybin-containing mushrooms, {{especially if the}} ingestion is accidental or otherwise unexpected. Reactions characterized by violent behavior, suicidal thoughts, schizophrenia-like psychosis, and convulsions {{have been reported in}} the literature.

Psilocybin usage can temporarily induce a state of depersonalization disorder. Usage by those with schizophrenia can induce acute psychotic states requiring hospitalization.|$|E
5|$|In October 1973, the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC, {{consisting}} of the Arab majority of OPEC plus Egypt and Syria) declared significant production cuts and an oil embargo against the United States and other industrialized nations that supported Israel in the Yom Kippur War. A previous embargo attempt was largely ineffective {{in response to the}} Six-Day War in 1967. However, in 1973, the result was a sharp rise in oil prices and OPEC revenues, from US$3/bbl to US$12/bbl, and an emergency period of energy rationing, intensified by <b>panic</b> <b>reactions,</b> a declining trend in US oil production, currency devaluations, and a lengthy UK coal-miners dispute. For a time, the UK imposed an emergency three-day workweek. Seven European nations banned non-essential Sunday driving. US gas stations limited the amount of gasoline that could be dispensed, closed on Sundays, and restricted the days when gasoline could be purchased, based on license plate numbers. Even after the embargo ended in March 1974 following intense diplomatic activity, prices continued to rise. The world experienced a global economic recession, with unemployment and inflation surging simultaneously, steep declines in stock and bond prices, major shifts in trade balances and petrodollar flows, and a dramatic end to the post-WWII economic boom.|$|E

5000|$|Pseudodysphagia is {{the irrational}} fear of {{swallowing}} or choking. The symptoms are psychosomatic.

40|$|Accumulating {{evidence}} {{has suggested that}} neurotrophins participate in the pathophysiology of mood disorders. We have developed transgenic mice overexpressing the full-length neurotrophin- 3 receptor TrkC (TgNTRK 3) in the central nervous system.

Furthermore, treatment of TgNTRK 3 mice with diazepam significantly attenuated the anxiety-like behaviors in the plus maze. These results provide evidence for the involvement of TrkC in the development of noradrenergic neurons in the central nervous system with consequences on anxiety-like behavior and <b>panic</b> <b>reaction.</b> Thus, changes in TrkC expression levels could contribute to the phenotypic expression of panic disorder through a trophic effect on noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus.

50|$|Chemical mimicry {{refers to}} the {{production}} of one species’ chemical signals by another species. Many myrmecophilous Staphylinids have evolved chemical mimicry to deter or placate ants. Synecthrans, as non tolarated guests, primarily produce defensive secretions. Pella species produce two compounds found in their host ant Lasius fuliginosus, undecane and sulcatone, which elicit aggressive and <b>panic</b> <b>reactions</b> respectively. Although it seems counterintuitive to release an aggressive alarm pheromone as a defense, the presence of sulcatone stops the aggression response to undecane. Ants exposed to the defensive secretion act less aggressively and avoid the odor.|$|E

5000|$|By the mid-60s the {{backlash}} {{against the use of}} LSD and its perceived corrosive effects on the values of the Western middle class resulted in governmental action to restrict the availability of the drug by making any use of it illegal.

40|$|Although peritraumatic {{dissociation}} predicts subsequent {{posttraumatic stress}} disorder (PTSD), little is understood about the mechanism of this relationship. This study examines the role of panic during trauma {{in the relationship between}} peritraumatic dissociation and subsequent PTSD. Randomized eligible admissions to 4 major trauma hospitals across Australia (n= 244) were assessed during hospital admission and within one month of trauma exposure for panic, peritraumatic dissociation and PTSD symptoms, and subsequently re-assessed for PTSD three months after the initial assessment (n= 208). Twenty (9. 6 %) patients met criteria for PTSD at 3 -months post injury. Structural equation modeling supported the proposition that peritraumatic derealization (a subset of dissociation) mediated the effect of <b>panic</b> <b>reactions</b> during trauma and subsequent PTSD symptoms. The mediation model indicated that <b>panic</b> <b>reactions</b> are linked to severity of subsequent PTSD via derealization, indicating a significant indirect relationship. Whereas peritraumatic derealization is associated with chronic PTSD symptoms, this relationship is influenced by initial acute panic responses. Richard A.

This is being caused by: turbulence in the scour stream by scour locks in the Afsluitdyke, causing the smelts sluiced from the Ysel Lake, are brought to the surface and through <b>panic</b> <b>reactions</b> of the smelts in the channels, which are caused by the strong changes in salinity, causing the smelts to rise to the surface.

The number was estimated at 10 to 30 million. The smelt from the Ysel Lake and the Wadden Sea was for 98 to 99 % contaminated with cysts of meacercaria of the parasite Cotylurus erraticus (Rudolphi, 1809).

40|$|It is {{commonly}} believed that people become selfish {{and turn to}} looting, price gouging, and other immoral behaviour in emergencies. This has been the basis for an argument justifying extraordinary measures in emergencies. It states that if emergencies are not curtailed, breakdown of moral norms threaten ('the moral black hole'). Using the example of natural disasters, we argue that the validity of this argument in non-antagonistic situations, i. e. situations other than war and armed conflict, is highly questionable. Available evidence suggests that people in such emergencies typically do not display <b>panic</b> <b>reactions</b> or exaggerated selfishness, and that phenomena such as looting and price gouging are rare. Furthermore, {{a version of the}} moral-black-hole argument based on the mere possibility of a moral black hole occurring runs into problems similar to those of Pascal's Wager.
