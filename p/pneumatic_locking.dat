40|$|Following a brief {{survey of}} the {{historic}} develop-ment of pneumatic prostheses the actual prin-ciples of prosthetic management in bilateral shoulder disarticulation or bilateral amelia are ex p 1 a i n e d. The active functions are restricted to active pronation and supination, active gripping of the terminal device “hook ” or “hand”, com-bined with <b>pneumatic</b> <b>locking</b> of free swinging shoulder and elbow jdints in one artificial arm; the cosmetic arm provides only space for the power package in the resin socket of the upper arm. Both arms are suspended on a Simpson frame. Thus optical control is concentrated on {{the movements of the}} functional arm. The reduction of valve control makes prosthetic training and use easier. Recently hybrid systems came into use be-cause electric power proved superior to pneu-matic power for pronation and supination and gripping, whereas CO, is still necessary for locking the elbow and the shoulder joint. The accumulator can be recharged daily at a plug socket, the CO container need only be refilled after one or two weeks ensuring more indepen-dence for the disabled. The advantage of such a prosthesis is the better appearance in public combined with a certain functional use. However only intensive foot training without prostheses provides independence in daily acti-vities, because even sophisticated prosthetic systems cannot make up completely for body loss...|$|E
2500|$|The route {{has been}} {{featured}} in several train simulator games. Trainz Simulator 2010 features the route between London and York, Trainz Simulator 12 extends the route to Newcastle, and Trainz: A New Era brings {{it all the way}} to Edinburgh, allowing the entire 393-mile route to be driven. All three routes take place during the 1970s, around the time the InterCity 125 was introduced. This is reinforced by instructions in the [...] "HST Southbound Express" [...] session not to move until the guard has locked the doors, since the trains did not have <b>pneumatic</b> <b>locks</b> initially; doing so will lead to an automatic failure. Other rolling stock includes Class 37s, Class 47s, and Class 105s, plus Mark 2 coaches. TS12's version added Class 55 Deltics and Class 313s, as well as additional pre-made, pre-scripted sessions.|$|R
40|$|Introduction To {{accommodate}} the new Argos 500 MEG instrument [1] a general upgrade {{of the existing}} 2 + 1 layer magnetically shielded room at the neurological department was necessary. Due to the innovative technology and the ambitious goal more stringent requirements where set for shielding performances and shielding anisotropy. The upgrade process of the existing MSR {{was carried out in}} cooperation with Advanced Technologies Biomagnetics and consisted in: 1. Adding a third layer of soft magnetic material. 2. Redesigning the structure supporting the magnetic layers of the door to improve the matching with the walls to reduce the door effects. 3. Redesigning completely the operation of the door by removing all hidden mechanisms and leverages and replacing them with external <b>pneumatic</b> <b>locks.</b> 4. Adding extra features like automatic emergency release of the door in case of power and or airpressure failure and manual locks disengage in case of mechanical failure. 2 Methods The Magneti...|$|R
50|$|The entire train {{composition}} from was designed {{the beginning to}} be operated by one man. Therefore, all doors are equipped with a <b>pneumatic</b> door <b>locking</b> feature that can be operated from the cab (side selective door release). The doors have push button pre-selection keys adjacent to them. They also have a door closure system that closes the doors automatically when the vehicle starts moving, and keeps them closed while driving.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you want}} to see the coach locked you'd better go aboard. It's due now," [...] says Mr. Geary. I enter through the door amidships. There is nothing here for display. The inner skin of the gas-tanks comes down to within a foot or two of my head and turns over just short of the turn of the bilges. Liners and yachts {{disguise}} their tanks with decoration, but the G. P. O. serves them raw under a lick of gray official paint. The inner skin shuts off fifty feet of the bow and as much of the stern, but the bow-bulkhead is recessed for the lift-shunting apparatus as the stern is pierced for the shaft-tunnels. The engine-room lies almost amidships. Forward of it, extending to the turn of the bow tanks, is an aperture--a bottomless hatch at present--into which our coach will be locked. One looks down over the coamings three hundred feet to the despatching-caisson whence voices boom upward. The light below is obscured to a sound of thunder, as our coach rises on its guides. It enlarges rapidly from a postage-stamp to a playing-card; to a punt and last a pontoon. The two clerks, its crew, do not even look up as it comes into place. The Quebec letters fly under their fingers and leap into the docketed racks, while both captains and Mr. Geary satisfy themselves that the coach is locked home. A clerk passes the waybill over the hatch-coaming. Captain Purnall thumb-marks and passes it to Mr. Geary. Receipt has been given and taken. [...] "Pleasant run," [...] says Mr. Geary, and disappears through the door which a foot-high <b>pneumatic</b> compressor <b>locks</b> after him.|$|R
