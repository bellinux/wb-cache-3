40|$|This article {{describes}} {{a method for}} determining the <b>polydispersity</b> <b>index</b> Ip 2 =Mz/Mw of the molecular weight distribution (MWD) of linear polymeric materials from linear viscoelastic data. The method uses the Mellin transform of the relaxation modulus of a simple molecular rheological model. One of the main features of this technique is that it enables interesting MWD information to be obtained directly from dynamic shear experiments. It {{is not necessary to}} achieve the relaxation spectrum, so the ill-posed problem is avoided. Furthermore, a determinate shape of the continuous MWD {{does not have to be}} assumed in order to obtain the <b>polydispersity</b> <b>index.</b> The technique has been developed to deal with entangled linear polymers, whatever the form of the MWD is. The rheological information required to obtain the <b>polydispersity</b> <b>index</b> is the storage G′(ω) and loss G″(ω) moduli, extending from the terminal zone to the plateau region.

30|$|Measurements of {{particle}} size and size distribution were performed using a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments GmbH, Herrenberg, Germany). The device operates {{on the principle}} of DLS, according to which time-dependent fluctuations in the intensity of light scattered from suspended particles are recorded. The Malvern software permits different size calculation modes. The cumulant method described in ISO 22412 yields the mean particle diameter, xDLS, and the <b>polydispersity</b> <b>index</b> <b>PI.</b> This index describes the polydispersity of the investigated system (0, monodisperse; 1, polydisperse). In addition to the cumulant method, particle size distributions (PSD) were calculated using the software integrated general purpose mode. A refractive index of 2.0 was taken for calculation of the PSD [29]. Due to the fast agglomeration process under physiological conditions found in some cases, the change in particle size in the physiological media was only evaluated by the cumulant method.

40|$|An {{innovative}} {{mass spectrometry}} method {{was developed for}} determining mass distributions of tannin fractions that cannot be approached through direct MALDI-TOF analysis. It was applied to three procyanidin fractions with average degrees of polymerizations = 3, 9, and 28, respectively, and one gallotannin fraction (Tara tannin). The proposed approach consists of MALDI-TOF analysis of the soluble complexes formed between these tannin fractions and bovine serum albumin (BSA). Complexes were detected as an unresolved "hump" following the BSA signal, and spectra were mathematically processed to determine the parameters relative to the protein-tannin complexes, which are the number-average molecular weight (Mn), the weight-average molecular weight (Mw), and the <b>polydispersity</b> <b>index</b> (<b>PI)</b> for each tannin fraction.

40|$|Abstract: Solid lipid {{nanoparticles}} (SLNs) are a well-tolerated lipid {{carrier system}} {{due to the}} employment of a physiological and/or biodegradable lipid matrix. Physicochemical properties such as particle size, <b>polydispersity</b> <b>index</b> (<b>PI)</b> and zeta potential are SLN quality response parameters. Increased particle size is a good indicator of in-vitro instability. This work focuses {{on the importance of}} selecting the lipid matrices and excipients that can achieve the particle size and stability required if such formulations are to be utilised in the pharmaceutical market. With the aim of understanding the influence of variation in SLN composition (lipid and emulsifier concentration), a Taguchi model of experimental design was applied. Tested factors included the concentration of lipid (stearic acid) and the concentration of Tween® 20. SLNs were successfully prepared by a microemulsion-based technique.

When rotor-stator system energy input parameters are fixed, homogenization pressure and recirculation will affect mean particle size and large diameter droplet. Particle size will decrease with increasing homogenization pressure from 400  bar to 1300  bar when homogenization recirculation is fixed; when the homogenization pressure is fixed at 1000  bar, the particle size of both MDS and percent of fat droplets exceeding 5  μm (PFAT 5) will decrease with increasing homogenization recirculations, MDS dropped to 173  nm after five cycles and maintained this level, volume-weighted PFAT 5 will drop to 0. 038 % after three cycles, so the “plateau” of MDS will come up later than that of PFAT 5, and the optimal particle size is produced when both of them remained at plateau.
