5|$|Hibiki is a {{young girl}} with little {{confidence}} in her abilities, except in tea making. When she met Shirotsuki, Hibiki was a shy girl who would hide {{in the corner of}} a room in his house speechlessly. Eventually, Hibiki warmed up to Shirotsuki's affectionate personality and came to consider him a very important person. Hibiki can be very lighthearted, and always helps <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>need</b> it. She has no talent for magic, and relies on her master to help her in this regard. She is a crybaby and somewhat clumsy, but does her best and wins people over with her abundant kindness and warm heart.|$|E

25|$|The use of {{advanced}} triage may become necessary when medical professionals {{decide that the}} medical resources available are not sufficient to treat all the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>need</b> help. The treatment being prioritized can include the time spent on medical care, or drugs or other limited resources. This has happened in disasters such as terrorist attacks, mass shootings, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tornadoes, thunderstorms, and rail accidents. In these cases some percentage of patients will die regardless of medical care because {{of the severity of}} their injuries. Others would live if given immediate medical care, but would die without it.|$|E

25|$|Several obituaries {{describe}} Liberati's professional experience, {{highlighting the}} main features of his work and the ideas he supported. He believed that within a health system, research should {{be an integral part}} of its mission, especially where lack of commercial interests prevents the possibility of private investment, and that researchers should concentrate on what is relevant to patients, not to their careers or to drug companies. Moreover, he strongly believed that developing alliances with consumers is necessary for setting research priorities, and that research results should be easily accessible to <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>need</b> to make decisions about their own health.|$|E

The front two legs of the walker {{may or may not}} have wheels attached depending on the strength and abilities of the person using it. It is also common to see caster wheels or glides on the back legs of a walker with wheels on the front.|$|E
25|$|The {{crisis in}} health and welfare {{services}} in our nation today highlights for NASW what {{many of us have}} been stressing for a long time: inherent in the responsibility for leadership in social welfare is responsibility for professional action. They are not disparate aspects of social work but merely two faces of the same coin to be spent on more and better services for the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>need</b> our help. It is out of our belief in this broad definition of responsibility for social welfare that NASW is taking leadership in the efforts to reorder our nation's priorities and future direction, and is calling on social workers everywhere to do the same.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the first}} {{community}} bicycle projects in the United States was started in Portland, Oregon in 1994 by civic and environmental activists Tom O'Keefe, Joe Keating and Steve Gunther. It took the approach of simply releasing a number of bicycles to the streets for unrestricted use. While Portland's Yellow Bike Project was successful in terms of publicity, it proved unsustainable due to theft and vandalism of the bicycles. The Yellow Bike Project was eventually terminated, and replaced with the Create A Commuter (CAC) program, which provides free secondhand bicycles to certain preselected low-income and disadvantaged <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>need</b> a bicycle {{to get to work}} or attend job training courses, and the 2016 Biketown system.|$|E
25|$|Efforts {{to improve}} {{nutrition}} {{are some of}} the most effective forms of development aid. Breastfeeding can reduce rates of malnutrition and death in children, and efforts to promote the practice increase the rates of breastfeeding. In young children, providing food (in addition to breastmilk) between six months and two years of age improves outcomes. There is also good evidence supporting the supplementation of a number of micronutrients to women during pregnancy and among young children in the developing world. To get food to <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>need</b> it most, both delivering food and providing money so people can buy food within local markets are effective. Simply feeding students at school is insufficient. Management of severe malnutrition within the person's home with ready-to-use therapeutic foods is possible much of the time. In those who have severe malnutrition complicated by other health problems, treatment in a hospital setting is recommended. This often involves managing low blood sugar and body temperature, addressing dehydration, and gradual feeding. Routine antibiotics are usually recommended due to the high risk of infection. Longer-term measures include: improving agricultural practices, reducing poverty, improving sanitation, and the empowerment of women.|$|E
25|$|DN3: (Defense against natural disasters). The Army {{should always}} be ready to help the civil {{population}} in case of disaster. This includes preventive measures. For example, between August and November, military forces are sent to Mexican coastal areas to aid {{the public in the}} event of hurricanes or floods. For the Mexican people, the DN3 plan is the most important peacetime operation of the Army. The Army provides food, shelter, medicine, and medical services to the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>need</b> them. This also includes reconstruction of roads and communication services. Because calling the implementation DN3 plan is an acceptance of severe problems, the DN3 plan was not invoked in the 1985 Mexico City earthquake that left large areas of Mexico City in ruins, since the authorities did not want to recognize there was an emergency in the capital, while the army was called to the city, it was just a peacekeeping force. This later became a severe questioning on the government. The Mexican Army provided aid to the US following Hurricane Katrina. More recently, the DN3 plan was invoked in 2009 when an epidemic of swine flu threatened the population and in 2010 after the states of Veracruz, Tabasco, Nuevo León, Chiapas, Oaxaca and Guerrero were severely affected by floods caused by a number of hurricanes and tropical storms.|$|E
