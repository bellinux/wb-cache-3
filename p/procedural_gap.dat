40|$|Scholars {{have long}} argued that Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act can {{or should be}} {{interpreted}} to reach more conduct than Section 1 of Sherman Act - whether, in other words, there are gaps in the coverage of Section 1 that allow certain forms of anticompetitive conduct that Section 5 should condemn. Perhaps {{the most important issue}} in the interpretation of Section 1 concerns how courts should distinguish conscious parallelism from unlawful concerted action. In this paper, I argue that there is no substantive gap between the two antitrust statutes on this issue-both statutes prohibit (and permit) the same conduct. There may, however, be a <b>procedural</b> <b>gap.</b> Particularly after the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s 2007 decision in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, the FTC has an advantage over private plaintiffs in the procedures at its disposal for discovering unlawful concerted action...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the current criticisms of Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) are ill-informed, and {{attempts}} at reforming the system are misguided. The definition of ISDS itself has been, for a long time, limited to investment quasi-judicial bodies or at best arbitration. Analysis of {{the roots of the}} ever growing backlash reveals that the main causes for concern are politically negotiated investment treaties, an inherently biased system, lack of transparency, and inconsistent decision-making. Examination of the core reasons behind these complaints leads {{to the conclusion that the}} EU Commission’s solution to reform ISDS through a permanent court raises more issues and will throw ISDS into disarray. A better approach is to accept the premise that the current system needs improvement. However, accepting this premise requires regulating disputes themselves, rather than simply regulating the resolution of cases, and establishing standards when unable to regulate these. The regulation of disputes would allow the work already begun by UNCITRAL through its notes on transparency to continue. This study will review how introducing mediation to regulate the process of Investor State Disputes (ISD) can improve and indeed complement the <b>procedural</b> <b>gap</b> evident in the current ISDS system. In particular, while considering more recent investment regimes, it will use the current effort by the Energy Charter Treaty Secretariat to facilitate mediation within the Treaty as an example of how this can be done...|$|E

50|$|Despite the admonishment to look {{exclusively}} {{to the law of}} nations, some circuits post-Sosa have filled <b>procedural</b> <b>gaps</b> by borrowing from American precedent. In Chavez v. Carranza, the Sixth Circuit adopted a ten-year statute of limitations for ATS claims, though allowing for equitable tolling in the interests of fairness. In Sarei v. Rio Tinto, PLC, the Ninth Circuit remanded the case for an analysis of whether plaintiffs exhausted remedies in the country where the original tort took place, though recognizing that exhaustion is not required in all cases. The Sarei decision, though based on prudential rather than statutory factors, seems to reject the implication that Sosa leaned toward not recognizing an exhaustion requirement.|$|R
40|$|As {{addressed}} by Lefebvre's theories on the 'Production of Space', {{there has always}} been discrepancies between the conceived spaces of the producers and the perceived / lived spaces of the users. Particularly with public spaces, history has shown that these spaces have often contested and conflicted in Hong Kong, where the public realm has been shrinking at an alarming rate, becoming less accessible, and often overly maintained and subject to surveillance and policing. This study attempts to carry on the debates in this regard, and provide a new limelight towards how public spaces can be considered and planned for in the case of Hong Kong. Through the extensive review of literature and numerous interviews and discussions with various professionals, scholars, government officials, local bodies, etc. it was found that institutional and <b>procedural</b> <b>gaps,</b> along with the focus on maintaining and satisfying standards and the economic well-being of the city, hinder the development of a healthy and vibrant public realm. However, there is ample room for many possibilities and ways to resolve such issues, particularly when under the framework of a placemaking approach.

5000|$|Some {{experts have}} warned that Estonia's online voting system might be {{vulnerable}} to hacking. In 2014, J. Alex Halderman, {{an associate professor at}} the University of Michigan, described the Estonian [...] "i-voting" [...] system as [...] "pretty primitive by modern standards ... I got to observe the processes that they went through, and there were just—it was just quite sloppy throughout the whole time". A security analysis of the system by the University of Michigan and the Open Rights Group that was led by Halderman found that [...] "the I-voting system has serious architectural limitations and <b>procedural</b> <b>gaps</b> that potentially jeopardize the integrity of elections". The analysis concluded: As we have observed, the procedures Estonia has in place to guard against attack and ensure transparency offer insufficient protection. Based on our tests, we conclude that a state-level attacker, sophisticated criminal, or dishonest insider could defeat both the technological and procedural controls in order to manipulate election outcomes. ... Due to these risks, we recommend that Estonia discontinue use of the I-voting system. The Estonian National Electoral Committee responded to the report, stating that the claims [...] "were unsubstantiated and the described attacks infeasible." [...] Before each election, the system is rebuilt from the ground up, and security testing including penetration testing and denial-of-service mitigation tests are carried out. In their statement, the Estonian National Electoral Committee says: “every aspect of online balloting procedures is fully documented, these procedures are rigorously audited, and video documenting all conducted procedures is posted online. In addition to opening every aspect of our balloting to observers, we have posted the source code of our voting software online. In the past decade, our online balloting has stood up to numerous reviews and security tests. We believe that online balloting allows us to achieve a level of security greater than what is possible with paper ballots”.|$|R
40|$|State {{constitutional}} rights and procedural protections, of course, {{can only be}} asserted in state criminal prosecutions. As a result, where a defendant is prosecuted in federal court for conduct over which both a state {{and the federal government}} have criminal jurisdiction, he or she may be at a distinct disadvantage simply because of the fortuity or misfortune of having attracted the attention of federal prosecutors. And, upon conviction, a defendant will likely face a drastically harsher sentence than that which a state court would have imposed for the same conduct. The cumulative impact, therefore, of Congress 2 ̆ 7 s federalization, nationalization and standardization of criminal law and the U. S. Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s constitutionalization of criminal procedure has been to create categories of crimes for which a defendant could be prosecuted both federally and under state law. The level of procedural protection and severity of punishment the accused receives for the same conduct may vary significantly depending on which sovereign prosecutes the crime. It is this procedural disparity at which this article takes aim. Part II of this article sets out a brief background of the nationalization, federalization and standardization trend that has characterized the development of federal criminal law since the Civil War. Part III describes the state/federal <b>procedural</b> disparity <b>gap</b> created by the lower level of criminal procedural protection available to some defendants prosecuted federally for conduct traditionally within the purview of states and over which states have concurrent jurisdiction with the federal government. Part IV discusses the receding tide of federalism, nationalization, and standardization in the criminal law and explains why rectifying the state/federal <b>procedural</b> disparity <b>gap</b> must be included in that recalibration process. 2 ̆ 2 Part V submits that Congress has the obligation to address this state/federal procedural disparity and proposes that Congress enact legislation requiring federal courts to apply state rules of criminal procedure in concurrent jurisdiction prosecutions where a given federal rule does not provide the same level of protection as its state counterpart. A failure to do so, this article asserts, perpetuates an unjustifiable state/federal procedural disparity between defendants who are prosecuted federally for conduct over which a state has a superior historical and political jurisdictional claim...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This study {{investigates the}} {{procedures}} for non-governmental organizations (NGOs) {{to gain access}} to the European Union agenda-setting. These procedures are sought investigated in the light of the globalizing world and the increased variety of actors influencing the decision-making process at a supranational level. This raises the question of democratic legitimacy at a supranational level. This study applies a critical theoretical approach and thus uses a normative ideal to establish how democracy at a supranational level should institutionalize procedures for involving NGOs in the agenda-setting. The empirical data are based on interviews with actors from the organized civil society. Through an exploratory interview with the NGO Danish Society for a Living Sea (LS), their different channels of access to the EU decision-making are established and found to be based upon membership of various networks. The empirical data in this study is thus based on interviews with key employees in the networks Concord Denmark and Concord Europe, in the association Seas At Risk, and in Long Distance Regional Advisory Council established by the EU Commission. To ensure that the complexity in the empirical data is not lost when analyzed in relation to the democratic ideal, there is conducted a thematical analysis. The ideal applied in this study is based on Habermas’ procedural theory of deliberative democracy. The analysis is based on two levels in reaching access to the EU decision-making process, which were extracted from the empirical data: the first level is perceived as the NGOs’ access to the networks, the second is perceived as the networks’ access to the EU institutions. The analysis clarifies that it is easy for LS {{to gain access to}} the networks, yet their ability to take part in the internal agenda-setting in the networks is determined by their capacities. At the second level there are more difficulties in reaching access. The access as well as the agenda-setting is based upon the informal communication between organized civil society and EU institutions. The analysis exposes two major <b>procedural</b> <b>gaps</b> in the EU’s institutional setup, which promote informal communication. The first gap is the inability to institutionalize a room for the inclusion of the NGOs in the decision-making process in the EU. The second is the institutional structure of the EU’s institutions, which provide a room and incentives for informal communication. Thus it is concluded that supranational institutions in order to achieve deliberative democratic legitimacy must not only institutionalize a room for communicative rationality but also reform their own administrative structures...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{obstacles}} to sustainable development of the mining sector in Africa is conflicts. These conflicts emanate from various sources. However {{one of the key}} sources of misunderstanding is lack of communication between the rights holders (community and duty bearers (government and corporate) and this breakdown of communication is due to poor or nonexistent mechanisms of involvement of affected communities in decision making and ignorance. This study sought to examine the Kenyan Mining cycle and identify <b>procedural</b> and systemic <b>gaps</b> that if not addressed could trigger conflict in the emerging mining sector and suggest ways of mitigating them. Key among the greatest barriers to communal participation is ignorance regarding mining activities and also the language of instruction. Most rural people are uneducated and yet a large number of communication and notices are in English. Poor management of expectations is also a critical source of misunderstanding and hence conflict. Poor communal organization and lack of some sort of recognized authority give room for disorder and hence poor channels of communication...|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] Dispute {{settlement}} in the World Trade Organization (WTO) is carried out under the WTO Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU). In effect since January 1995, the DSU provides for consultations between disputing parties, panels and appeals, and possible retaliation if a defending party fails {{to comply with a}} WTO decision by an established deadline. Automatic establishment of panels, adoption of panel and appellate reports, and authorization of requests to retaliate, along with deadlines and improved multilateral oversight of compliance, are aimed at producing a more expeditious and effective system than had existed under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). To date, 398 complaints have been filed, approximately half involving the United States as complainant or defendant. Expressing dissatisfaction with WTO dispute settlement results in the trade remedy area, Congress, in the Trade Act of 2002, directed the executive branch to address dispute {{settlement in}} WTO negotiations. WTO Members have been negotiating DSU revisions in the currently stalled Doha Development Round of trade negotiations but no final agreement on the DSU has been reached. Use of the DSU has revealed <b>procedural</b> <b>gaps,</b> particularly affecting the compliance phase of a dispute. These include a failure to coordinate procedures for requesting retaliation with procedures for tasking a WTO panel with determining whether a defending Member has complied in a case and the absence of a procedure for withdrawing trade sanctions imposed by a complaining Member where the defending Member believes it has fulfilled its WTO obligations. As a result, disputing Members have entered into bilateral agreements permitting retaliation and compliance panel processes to progress on an agreed schedule and have initiated new dispute proceedings aimed at removing retaliatory measures. Where a U. S. law or regulation is at issue in a WTO case, the adoption by the WTO of a panel or Appellate Body report finding that the measure violates a WTO agreement does not give the report direct legal effect in this country; thus federal law is not affected until Congress or the executive branch, as the case may be, takes action to remove the offending measure. Where a restrictive foreign trade practice is at issue, Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 provides a mechanism by which the United States Trade Representative (USTR) may challenge the measure in a WTO dispute settlement proceeding and authorizes the USTR to take retaliatory action if the defending Member has not complied with the resulting WTO decision. Although Section 301 was challenged in the WTO on the ground that it requires the USTR to act unilaterally in WTO-related trade disputes in violation of DSU provisions requiring resort to multilateral WTO dispute settlement, the United States was ultimately found not to be in violation of its DSU obligations. H. R. 496 (Rangel) would create an Office of the Congressional Trade Enforcer (CTE) that would, inter alia, investigate restrictive foreign trade practices in light of WTO obligations and call on the USTR to initiate WTO dispute proceedings where the CTE finds that WTO violations have occurred; express congressional dissatisfaction with WTO dispute settlement decisions finding that the U. S. practice of “zeroing” (i. e., disregarding non-dumped sales in the calculation of dumping margins) violates the WTO Antidumping Agreement and with decisions of the WTO Appellate Body generally; and place restrictions on the Department of Commerce in implementing the revised antidumping methodology that it adopted in 2007 in response to the WTO “zeroing” decisions. S. 363 (Snowe), would give the U. S. Court of International Trade exclusive jurisdiction to review de novo certain USTR determinations under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which may in some cases involve the initiation and conduct of WTO disputes; the bill would also amend various Section 301 authorities themselves...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of the Head of Environmental Management Agency Decree 08 of 2000 (HEIMAD 8 / 2000), or the first guidelines concerning Public Involvement and Information Transparency in Indonesian EIA, {{is essential for the}} Indonesian EIA process. These participation guidelines require the local Environmental Impact Management Agencies (EIMAs) and proponents to inform the public about proposed projects, collect feedback, including written comments, through consultations, and embrace the public in EIA document reviews through their own representatives. Nevertheless, the performance of HEIMAD 08 of 2000 as the participation instrument for Indonesian EIA, in the context of indigenous peoples’ participation in the EIA decision-making process is rarely discussed. Therefore, investigations into the experience of indigenous peoples who get involved in Indonesian EIA practices need to be followed up to improve comprehension. In brief, this study aims to critically evaluate indigenous peoples’ participation in Indonesian EIA practices to improve and increase their involvement. To enable further understanding regarding their involvement in Indonesian EIA, this study starts by reviewing the participation guidelines. Initial reviews of the guidelines suggest that while indigenous people now have opportunities to engage in the EIA process, major inadequacies within the participation guidelines, that have the potential to hamper indigenous communities’ involvement, exist as well. To address the need for investigating indigenous participation in EIA practices, the study presented four case studies: (1) EIA of the BUS Coalmine project in Maybrat; (2) EIA of the MIL wood chip and pulp industry project in Merauke; (3) EIA of the ERII sago processing project in Nabire; and (4) EIA of the PPWD ring-road construction project taking place in the Jayapura region. All these projects are situated in the Papua or Papua Barat provinces and their EIA studies are required by legislation to involve local indigenous communities affected by them. Within the study, multiple qualitative methods such as document analysis, in-depth interviews of stakeholders, and direct observation of some indigenous participation activities were undertaken. Purposive sampling was used to select the informants. NVIVO 10 was used as well for data management and interpretation. Based on the evaluation of the case studies, this study reveals common patterns in indigenous participation. The participation process is often exclusive in character, as it primarily involved traditional landowner groups; other potentially affected stakeholders were rarely included or encouraged to get involved. In examining the enforcement of the participation guidelines, this study finds that not all of them were executed properly in the case studies. Inadequate information published in newspapers and broadcast during announcement stages, limited involvement of the affected communities in consultation forums, and the absence of formal appointments from the affected indigenous communities are the main examples of non-compliance issues identified in this area. In addition to the improper implementation of some of the provisions within the guidelines (non-compliance issues), this study also reveals that various operational issues (i. e. inappropriate public announcement approaches, the poor utilisation of written submissions, improper consultations, and the limited role of community representatives), coupled with the potential for future conflict also add to the complexity of indigenous community involvement. Although the participation guidelines, at a certain level, succeed in encouraging the involvement of indigenous communities in EIA processes, this study argues that the weak role of EIA institutions (local EIMAs) in enforcing those guidelines, coupled with the <b>procedural</b> <b>gaps</b> that exist within them, limit the benefit that can be derived from indigenous participation. Lessons from the case studies showed that a new approach for better indigenous participation is essential to ensure that indigenous communities have a strong voice in decisions that may impact their environment, culture and livelihoods. This study suggests that by complying with the participation guidelines, EIA institutions (EIMAs) can better fulfill the rights to participate for communities. In addition, improving the participation guidelines to embrace elements such as information access, indigenous capacity, time allocation and management, invitation mechanisms, access to EIA meeting venues, representative selection mechanisms, cultural influences, capacity improvement, and the mechanism for written submissions, is also critical for indigenous peoples’ participation...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study is}} to show that all students [...] regardless of their English language or mathematical proficiency ratings [...] can learn mathematics with conceptual understanding (Hansen-Thomas, 2009; Silver & Stein, 1996; Whitney, 2010). Results prior to the CTE indicated the following. First, middle school immigrant students answered a majority of questions correctly without justifying when it was not required on the pre-assessment. And second, pre-assessment questions influenced the ways that middle school immigrant students communicated and used representations. Results after the CTE revealed three major findings. One, all middle school immigrant student participants increased their conceptual understanding on the post-assessment. Two, post-assessment questions with a real-life situation that asked for multiple representations influenced the ways that middle school immigrant students communicated and used representations. Three, all students filled in <b>procedural</b> and conceptual <b>gaps</b> after listening to peer presentations, individually and as a team.
