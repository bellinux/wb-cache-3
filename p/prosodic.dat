25|$|Children don’t utter {{their first}} words {{until they are}} about 1 year old, but already at birth they can tell some utterances in their native {{language}} from utterances in languages with different <b>prosodic</b> features.|$|E
25|$|Research by Crystal {{emphasized}} the importance of making generalizations about intonation based on authentic, unscripted speech, and the roles played by <b>prosodic</b> features such as tempo, pitch range, loudness and rhythmicality in communicative functions usually attributed to intonation.|$|E
25|$|Infants can {{distinguish}} native from nonnative language input using phonetic and phonotactic patterns alone, i.e., {{without the help}} of <b>prosodic</b> cues. They seem to have learned their native language’s phonotactics, i.e., which combinations of sounds are possible in the language.|$|E
25|$|The {{dependency}} representations above (and further below) show syntactic dependencies. Indeed, most work in {{dependency grammar}} focuses on syntactic dependencies. Syntactic dependencies are, however, {{just one of}} three or four types of dependencies. Meaning–text theory, for instance, emphasizes the role of semantic and morphological dependencies in addition to syntactic dependencies. A fourth type, <b>prosodic</b> dependencies, can also be acknowledged. Distinguishing between these types of dependencies can be important, in part because if one fails to do so, the likelihood that semantic, morphological, and/or <b>prosodic</b> dependencies will be mistaken for syntactic dependencies is great. The following four subsections briefly sketch each of these dependency types. During the discussion, the existence of syntactic dependencies is taken for granted and used as an orientation point for establishing the nature of the other three dependency types.|$|E
25|$|As the <b>prosodic</b> {{unit of the}} dialect {{consists}} not of a lexical word {{but rather}} a minimal syntactic phrase known as bunsetsu, the high tone will shift, realigning itself to the ultimate or penultimate syllable, when morphemes, auxiliaries or grammatical particles such as が ga are appended at the end.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Brajesh Dikshit, Sanskrit scholar from Jabalpur, {{says that}} Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam {{combines}} the styles of three previous Sanskrit epics - {{it has two}} leading characters like in Bhāravi's Kirātārjunīyam, the poetic excellence and variety of <b>prosodic</b> metres is like in Śrīharṣa's Naiṣadhīyacaritam, while the length and extent {{of the work is}} like the Śiśupālavadham of Māgha.|$|E
25|$|The <b>prosodic</b> {{system of}} Koshikijima, {{like that of}} {{mainland}} Kagoshima, is characterized as a two-pattern pitch accent. It differs, however, in {{the placement of the}} accent. In this system, the primary high tone falls on a mora and is always preceded by a low-pitched syllable. Any other syllables preceding the low one will automatically bear a high tone.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} 1, {{children}} {{only just}} begin to speak, and their utterances are not adult-like yet at all. Children’s perceptual abilities are still developing, too. In fact, both production and perception abilities continue to develop well into the school years, with the perception of some <b>prosodic</b> features not being fully developed until about 12 years of age.|$|E
25|$|According to , {{there are}} 4,500 to 4,800 {{possible}} spoken syllables (depending on dialect), {{and the standard}} national orthography (Quốc Ngữ) can represent 6,200 syllables (Quốc Ngữ orthography represents more phonemic distinctions than are made by any one dialect). A description of syllable structure and exploration of its patterning according to the <b>Prosodic</b> Analysis approach of J.R. Firth is given in Henderson (1966).|$|E
25|$|One {{characteristic}} {{shared by}} many clitics {{is a lack of}} <b>prosodic</b> independence. A clitic attaches to an adjacent word, known as its host. Orthographic conventions treat clitics in different ways: Some are written as separate words, some are written as one word with their hosts, and some are attached to their hosts, but set off by punctuation (a hyphen or an apostrophe, for example).|$|E
25|$|There is {{a common}} {{agreement}} that disfluencies are accompanied by important modifications both at the segmental and <b>prosodic</b> levels and that speakers and listeners use such cues systematically and meaningfully. Thus they appear as linguistic universal devices {{that are similar to}} other devices and are controlled by the speaker and regulated by language specific constraints. In addition, speech disfluencies such as fillers can help listeners to identify upcoming words.|$|E
25|$|At 6 months, infants {{are also}} able {{to make use of}} <b>prosodic</b> {{features}} of the ambient language to break the speech stream they are exposed to into meaningful units, e.g., they are better able to distinguish sounds that occur in stressed vs. unstressed syllables. This means that at 6 months infants have some knowledge of the stress patterns in the speech they are exposed and they have learned that these patterns are meaningful.|$|E
25|$|Per , the {{following}} <b>prosodic</b> changes {{happened in the}} Common Slavic period, following the period where quality and quantity were correlated. At this point, the former acute register in long syllables (resulting from Proto-Indo-European laryngeals and certain other developments) had been lost (becoming circumflex) except in all syllables that were either accented or directly following the accent. The acute had also been lost in stressed syllables in the mobile paradigm (class C) {{as a result of}} Meillet's law.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} oft-studied aspects of the Kagoshima dialect is its <b>prosodic</b> system. With the {{exception}} of Tanegashima and Makurazaki City, the system {{is described as a}} two-pattern pitch accent in which phrasal units may be either unaccented or accented. In mainland Kagoshima, unaccented units will bear a low tonal pitch until the final syllable, at which point the pitch rises. In accented units, however, the pitch rises on the penultimate syllable, and then drops back down on the final syllable.|$|E
25|$|ASL is a subject-verb-object (SVO) language. This default {{word order}} is {{sometimes}} altered by processes including topicalization and null elements; however, this is marked either with non-manual signals like eyebrow or body position, or with <b>prosodic</b> marking such as pausing. These non-manual grammatical markings (such as eyebrow movement or head-shaking) may optionally {{spread over the}} c-command domain of the node which it is attached to. However, ASL is a pro-drop language, and when the manual sign that a non-manual grammatical marking is attached to is omitted, the non-manual marking obligatorily spreads over the c-command domain.|$|E
25|$|The rimes, in contrast, are over-specified. There are {{thirteen}} rime sounds, but twenty-six {{letters to}} represent them. One of each pair takes {{four of the}} eight tones, while the other takes the other four tones. Diacritics (none, dot, macron, and trema) distinguish the tones that each rime letter may carry. One of the tones, written -d in RPA, is not phonemic but is a <b>prosodic</b> unit-final allophone of the creaky register -m. It may be written in Pahawh by changing the dot diacritic to a short stroke, {{but it is not}} used by many people.|$|E
25|$|Given {{this basic}} definition, further {{criteria}} {{are needed to}} establish a dividing line between postlexical clitics and morphological affixes, since both are characterized {{by a lack of}} <b>prosodic</b> autonomy. There is no natural, clear-cut boundary between the two categories (since from a historical point of view, a given form can move gradually {{from one to the other}} by morphologization). However, by identifying clusters of observable properties that are associated with core examples of clitics on the one hand, and core examples of affixes on the other, one can pick out a battery of tests that provide an empirical foundation for a clitic/affix distinction.|$|E
25|$|Verb stems are inflected {{through a}} number of {{different}} processes: the initial consonant of the verb root changes according to a morphophonemic pattern of consonant mutations to mark present vs. non-present, and active vs. passive. Verbal roots may take a formative syllable or not depending on syntactic and <b>prosodic</b> factors. A nasal prefix may be added to the root to express reciprocality or middle voice. Some dialects, notably the eastern ones, have a system of verb classes that take different series of prefixes. These conjugational categories have been lost in the Western dialects, although they existed in the Western areas in the colonial period as can be seen from Cárceres's grammar.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of syllable-ordering biases {{is an important}} step along the way to full language development. The ability to categorize syllables and group together frequently co-occurring sequences may be critical in the {{development of}} a protolexicon, a set of common language-specific word templates based on characteristic patterns in the words an infant hears. The development of this protolexicon may in turn allow for the recognition of new types of patterns, e.g. the high frequency of word-initially stressed consonants in English, which would allow infants to further parse words by recognizing common <b>prosodic</b> phrasings as autonomous linguistic units, restarting the dynamic cycle of word and language learning.|$|E
25|$|The hyphens {{and lack}} of {{projection}} lines indicate <b>prosodic</b> dependencies. A hyphen that appears on {{the left of the}} clitic indicates that the clitic is prosodically dependent on the word immediately to its left (He'll, There's), whereas a hyphen that appears {{on the right side of}} the clitic (not shown here) indicates that the clitic is prosodically dependent on the word that appears immediately to its right. A given clitic is often prosodically dependent on its syntactic dependent (He'll, There's) or on its head (would've). At other times, it can depend prosodically on a word that is neither its head nor its immediate dependent (Florida's).|$|E
500|$|For example, {{the stress}} mark may be doubled to {{indicate}} an extra degree of stress, such as <b>prosodic</b> stress in English. An example in French, {{with a single}} stress mark for normal <b>prosodic</b> stress {{at the end of}} each <b>prosodic</b> unit (marked as a minor <b>prosodic</b> break), and a double stress mark for contrastive/emphatic stress: [...] [...] Similarly, a doubled secondary stress mark [...] is commonly used for tertiary stress.|$|E
500|$|... {Braces} {{are used}} for <b>prosodic</b> notation. See Extensions to the International Phonetic Alphabet for {{examples}} in that system.|$|E
500|$|Observing their {{burdensome}} <b>prosodic</b> effect, {{the poet}} Matthew Arnold remarked, [...] "these three lines by themselves take up {{nearly as much}} time as a whole book of the Iliad." ...|$|E
500|$|Dr. Brajesh Dikshit, Sanskrit scholar from Jabalpur, {{says that}} Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam {{combines}} the styles of three previous Sanskrit epics – {{it has two}} leading characters like in Bhāravi's Kirātārjunīyam, the poetic excellence and variety of <b>prosodic</b> metres is like in Śrīharṣa's [...] Naiṣadhīyacaritam, while the length and extent {{of the work is}} like the Śiśupālavadham of Māgha.|$|E
500|$|IPA {{diacritics}} may be {{doubled to}} indicate an extra degree of the feature indicated. This is a productive process, {{but apart from}} extra-high and extra-low tones [...] being marked by doubled high- and low-tone diacritics, and the major <b>prosodic</b> break [...] being marked as a double minor break , it is not specifically regulated by the IPA. (Note that transcription marks are similar: double slashes indicate extra (morpho)-phonemic, double square brackets especially precise, and double parentheses especially unintelligible.) ...|$|E
500|$|The Ramcharitmanas was {{composed}} by Tulsidas {{in the late}} sixteenth century. It has been extremely popular in northern India {{over the last four}} hundred years, and {{is often referred to as}} the [...] "Bible of northern India" [...] by Western Indologists. Rambhadracharya produced a critical edition of the Ramcharitmanas, which was published as the Tulsi Peeth edition. Apart from the original text, for which Rambhadracharya has relied extensively on older manuscripts, there were differences in spelling, grammar, and <b>prosodic</b> conventions between the Tulsi Peeth edition and contemporary editions of the Ramcharitmanas.|$|E
500|$|The IPA {{once had}} {{parallel}} symbols from alternative proposals, {{but in most}} cases eventually settled on one for each sound. The rejected symbols are now considered obsolete. An example is the vowel letter , rejected in favor of [...] Letters for affricates and sounds with inherent secondary articulation have also been mostly rejected, with the idea that such features should be indicated with tie bars or diacritics: [...] for [...] is one. In addition, the rare voiceless implosives, , have been dropped and are now usually written [...] A retired set of click letters, , is still sometimes seen, as the official pipe letters [...] may cause problems with legibility, especially when used with brackets ( [...] or / /), the letter , or the <b>prosodic</b> marks [...] (for this reason, some publications which use the current IPA pipe letters disallow IPA brackets).|$|E
500|$|Kannada {{literature}} {{from this period}} is usually categorised into the linguistic phase called Old-Kannada. It constituted {{the bulk of the}} Chalukya court's textual production and pertained mostly to writings relating to the socio-religious development of the Jain faith. The earliest well-known writers belonging to the Shaiva faith are also from this period. [...] Under the patronage of Kalachuri King Bijjala II, whose prime minister was the well-known Kannada poet and social reformer Basavanna, a native form of poetic literature called Vachana literature (lit [...] "utterance", [...] "saying" [...] or [...] "sentence") proliferated. The beginnings of the Vachana poetic tradition in the Kannada-speaking region trace back to the early 11th century. Kannada literature written in the champu metre, composed of prose and verse, was popularised by the Chalukyan court poets. However, {{with the advent of the}} Veerashaiva (lit, [...] "brave devotees of the god Shiva") religious movement in the mid-12th century, poets favoured the native tripadi (three-line verse composed of eleven ganas or <b>prosodic</b> units), hadugabba (song-poem) and free verse metres for their poems.|$|E
500|$|Chapter XVII of The Phonetics of French {{was about}} intonation, but her main {{work on the}} topic was the 1934 book Studies in French Intonation co-written with her {{colleague}} Hélène Coustenoble. This book was written for English learners of French as well; it provided the first comprehensive description of French intonation. French intonation was also analyzed in terms of tunes; it was a configuration-based approach, where intonation consists of a sequence of discrete pitch contours. French intonation essentially consists of three contours in their analysis, namely: rise-falling, falling, and rising. Armstrong and Coustenoble made use of a <b>prosodic</b> unit known as a Sense Group, which they defined as [...] "each of the smallest groups of grammatically related words into which many sentences may be divided". The book also provides discussion of English intonation in order to demonstrate how French intonation differs. One contemporary review noted that [...] "it seems to have received a favourable reception" [...] in England. The book contained numerous exercises, which led to another reviewer calling it [...] "an excellent teaching manual" [...] as well. Oxford linguist [...] called the book [...] "very useful" [...] in 1936, Austrian philologist Elise Richter called it [...] "an admirable achievement" [...] in 1938, and American linguist Robert A. Hall, Jr. called the book [...] "excellent" [...] in 1946. It has been later described as [...] "highly idealized" [...] for being based on conventions of reading French prose out loud. It {{is considered to be}} a [...] "classic work on French intonation".|$|E
