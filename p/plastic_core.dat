25|$|One of the {{difficulties}} that result from these long development times and high costs is making accurate cores repeatably. This is extremely important because the core {{is an integral part}} of the mold, so essentially each shot is into a new mold cavity. Another difficulty is keeping the core from melting when the plastic is shot into the mold, because the plastic is approximately twice the melting temperature of the core material. A third difficulty is the low strength of the <b>core.</b> Hollow <b>plastic</b> <b>cores</b> can collapse if too much pressure is used in the shot <b>plastic.</b> Metal <b>cores</b> (with low melting temperatures) are solid so they cannot collapse, but are only 10% as strong as steel cores so they can distort. This is especially a problem when molding manifolds, because the waviness of the core can be detrimental to the airflow within the runners.|$|R
40|$|Constrained {{viscoelastic}} layers {{have traditionally}} been consid-ered as damping enhancement mechanisms.

The present study focuses on computational strategies {{that can be used to}} analyze and design the vibroa-coustic behavior of such assemblies. Difficulties of the task are the use of experimentally derived complex moduli for the viscoelastic materials, studies in the frequency and tempera-ture domains, integration of the bonded shells into large finite element models, ability to modify the geometry of a particular assembly in an optimization phase or the ability to account for changes in the viscoelastic material properties during the part forming process.

40|$|A new {{honeycomb}} core design {{has been used}} to increase the stiffness of the panel and applied to improve the noise transmission loss at frequencies between 100 and 200 Hz. A model is presented to predict the transmission loss of the honeycomb panels based on the structural modal parameters. A new test specimen with fiber reinforced <b>plastic</b> <b>cores</b> and face sheets had been used to investigate the effect of stiffness and damping on noise transmission loss. The measurements of noise transmission loss have been compared with data for common structural panels. The results show that the new core fabrication techniques using moulding to improve the noise transmission are effective. In comparison to a cement panel of the same mass, the honeycomb panels have higher TL at low frequencies between 100 and 200 Hz due to higher stiffness and damping. The honeycomb panels have more significant vibration responses above 500 Hz but these are limited by damping. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Current {{trends in}} {{vehicular}} technology reflect {{an increase in}} the number of electronic modules, leading to more complicated and expensive wiring. The use of optic fibers offers a low-cost alternative to traditional copper-wire harnesses. This paper presents a bidirectional, alignment-tolerant optoelectronic interconnect for automotive applications. The proposed interconnect offers a low manufacturing potential cost because it uses inexpensive alignment tolerant large <b>core</b> <b>plastic</b> fiber for ease of connector alignment. The optoelectronic interface chip uses time-division multiplexing to combine several information sources into a serial data stream that can be easily decoded by a microcontroller. By using a colocated small emitter in the middle of a large detector, the system achieves both bidirectional communication on a single fiber and alignment tolerant capabilities. Results show that this optoelectronic interconnect is a feasible replacement for wire harnesses in automobiles.

5000|$|There is {{evidence}} that when sandwich panels are used to clad a building it {{can contribute to the}} rapid spread of fire up the outside of the building itself. As an architect put it, in choosing the core material for a sandwich panel “I only use the mineral wool ones because your gut tells you it is not right to wrap a building in plastic”.

He said the panels “can contribute to the severity and speed of fire development” and this has led to “massive fire losses".|$|R

40|$|Aim: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the influence of the smear layer on the coronal microleakage in root canals obturated with laterally condensed cold gutta-percha or Thermafil and two root canal sealers. Materials and methods: Sixty extracted single-rooted human teeth with straight root canals were allocated to two experimental groups. The root canals were instrumented using the STEP-BACK technique, K reamers and K files and irrigated with 2. 5 % NaOCl. The teeth in the first group were treated with 17 % EDTA and 2. 5 % NaOCl to remove the smear layer. The teeth in both groups were obturated either with laterally condensed cold guttapercha (28 teeth) or Thermafil gutta-percha with <b>plastic</b> <b>cores</b> (28 teeth) and RSA or AH-PLUS sealers. The specimens were evaluated for coronal microleakage using silver nitrate solution. The linear penetration of the dye was assessed using a binocular magnifying glass (x 25), with an inserted micrometer scale. Results: The results showed low coronal microleakage in the group where the smear layer was removed in both the lateral compaction technique (RSA - 1. 71 mm and AHPLUS - 1. 61 mm) and the Thermafil groups - RSA (1. 65 mm) and AH-PLUS (1. 66 mm). In the group with the intact smear layer, greater microleakage was noticed in both groups, lateral compaction technique -RSA (3. 06 mm) and AH-PLUS (2. 83 mm) and Thermafil technique -RSA (2. 99 mm) and AH-PLUS (2. 83 mm). The difference was statistically significant between the groups with and without the smear layer for both RSA (p< 0. 001) and AH-PLUS sealers (p< 0. 001). Conclusion: The present results suggest that the removal of the smear layer significantly improves the tightness of the coronal seal and reduces the coronal microleakage...|$|R

Since the masonry units can be constructed with ease. Fifty billion water bottles are consumed every year. Lack of waste management and recycling {{in third world countries}} has come to the attention of many organizations. The use of plastic bottles in construction materials has been around for the past twenty years, but with little focus on using full plastic bottles in the materials. The Engineers Without Borders student group on the campus at Kansas State University {{have found a way to}} utilize the full 500 -mL plastic bottle in the creation of concrete walls. The bottles laid horizontally with concrete on both sides and as mortar between the bottles was used. These bottles create large voids in the wall decreasing the compressive strength of the wall. This thesis presents the results of a study conducted to determine the compressive strength of concrete masonry units with <b>plastic</b> bottle <b>cores.</b> The <b>plastic</b> bottles were used to create the center voids in the masonry units.

40|$|The {{research}} {{is divided into}} two parts. In the first part the structural behaviour of sandwich beams using timber-based facings and foamed <b>plastic</b> <b>cores</b> was studied. Various available theories were examined and the most appropriate theory for this type of panel was identified. In an extensive test programme the relevant properties of the constituent materials were measured and the data used in the proposed theory of structural behaviour to predict beam deflections and core and facing stresses. Corresponding sandwich beam tests were carried out on the range of skin/core combinations and the theoretical and experimental behaviours were compared. Good agreement was confirmed within the range of span/depth ratios investigated, confirming the applicability of the theory for semi-thick timber-based facings. A variety of timber based facings were investigated and those most suitable for sandwich construction were identified. This type of panel construction has many advantages but lacks the benefit of good fire resistance. The recF. iired fire resistance could be provided by a suitable core material. Part two of the research concentrated on {{the development of a new}} core material which was intended to have good structural properties at reasonable density, and to have adequate fire resistance free from the production of smoke and toxic fumes. Coated paper honeycombs were chosen for the study. The properties of the constituent materials were investigated in detail and then the structural properties of the developed cores were measured using methods drawn from national and international standards. One particular coating combination proved to be effective in terms of stiffness, fire resistance, freedom from micro cracking and strength retention at high temperature. This was based on a mixture of sodium silicate and ball clay. Cores were tested both with cells empty (to be blocked by intumescence) and with cells filled (e. g. with lightweight filler). In the best of the developed cores, shear stiffness and transverse stiffness were much higher than in normal core materials.
