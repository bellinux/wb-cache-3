5|$|Arias' {{maternal}} {{family was}} from Nicaragua, having left during <b>political</b> <b>upheaval</b> there before his birth. One of Arias' great uncles {{ran for president}} in Panama, while another was {{a supporter of the}} Nicaraguan revolutionary Sandino, a family history that gave Arias an early interest in politics. His father, an engineer, died when Arias was two years old, and he was raised primarily by his mother, aunt, and grandmother. His mother later remarried to a Panamanian ambassador to the United States.|$|E
5|$|Kepler {{postponed}} {{the move}} to Linz and remained in Prague until Rudolph's death in early 1612, though between <b>political</b> <b>upheaval,</b> religious tension, and family tragedy (along with the legal dispute over his wife's estate), Kepler could do no research. Instead, he pieced together a chronology manuscript, Eclogae Chronicae, from correspondence and earlier work. Upon succession as Holy Roman Emperor, Matthias re-affirmed Kepler's position (and salary) as imperial mathematician but allowed him to move to Linz.|$|E

5|$|The {{story of}} Carnivàle {{takes place in}} the mid-1930s during the worst of the Great Depression, a time of massive social and <b>political</b> <b>upheaval.</b> Unemployment rates were high, and European fascism was on the rise, in the years leading up to the Second World War. People in the Great Plains {{suffered}} from the effects of the Dust Bowl. Farmers often not only ran into debt and lost their properties but also risked their health; dust pneumonia was a common cause of death.|$|E
5|$|Association {{football}} {{was first introduced}} to Croatia by English expatriates working on industrial projects in Rijeka and Županja in 1873. By 1907, local clubs had been established in Croatia and a modern edition of the sport's laws was translated and published. Before the nation's independence, Croatian footballers played for the national teams of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (1919–39) and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (1945–90), though during periods of <b>political</b> <b>upheaval,</b> ethnically Croatian sides occasionally formed to play unofficial matches. A hastily arranged Croatian side, managed by Hugo Kinert, played a few matches in 1918–19.|$|E
5|$|Attitudes toward race in America {{began to}} change after the war, which had caused social and <b>political</b> <b>upheaval</b> and {{prompted}} {{people to think about}} the future with more ambition and confidence. Although progress was slow and racially motivated hostility continued for many years, the color barrier was broken in all major sports by 1950. Many of Motley and Willis's teammates on the Browns were used to playing with black players in college, where teams were integrated across most of the country. The presence of Motley and Willis, meanwhile, contributed to strong attendance at many of the Browns' early games as large black audiences came to watch them. By one estimate, 10,000 black fans saw the Browns play their first game.|$|E

5|$|Despite the <b>political</b> <b>upheaval,</b> the Egyptian temple style {{continued}} to evolve without absorbing much foreign influence. Whereas earlier temple building mostly focused on male gods, goddesses and child deities grew increasingly prominent. Temples {{focused more on}} popular religious activities such as oracles, animal cults, and prayer. New architectural forms {{continued to}} develop, such as covered kiosks in front of gateways, more elaborate column styles, and the mammisi, a building celebrating the mythical birth of a god. Though {{the characteristics of the}} late temple style had developed by the last period of native rule, most of the examples date from the era of the Ptolemies, Greek kings who ruled as pharaohs for nearly 300 years.|$|E
5|$|Houphouët-Boigny was a {{participant}} in the November 1960 Congo Crisis, a period of <b>political</b> <b>upheaval</b> and conflict in Congo-Kinshasa. The Ivorian leader supported President Joseph Kasa-Vubu, an opponent of Lumumba, and followed France in supporting the controversial Congolese Prime Minister Moise Tshombe. Tshombe, disliked by much of Africa, was passionately defended by Houphouët-Boigny and was even invited into OCAM in May 1965. After the overthrow of Kasa-Vubu by General Mobutu in November 1965, the Ivorian president supported, in 1967, a plan proposed by the French secret service which aimed to bring the deposed Congolese leader back into power. The operation was a failure. In response, Houphouët-Boigny decided to boycott the fourth annual summit of the OAU held in September 1967 in Kinshasa.|$|E
5|$|Indeed, {{this period}} in Greek history is {{remarkable}} {{for the social}} and <b>political</b> <b>upheaval</b> in many Greek cities, particularly {{the establishment of the}} first democracy in Athens. The island of Naxos, part of the Cyclades group in the Aegean Sea, was also in this period affected by political turmoil. Naxos had been ruled by the tyrant Lygdamis, a protege of the Athenian tyrant Peisistratos, until around 524 BC, when he was overthrown by the Spartans. After this, a native aristocracy seems to have flourished, and Naxos {{became one of the most}} prosperous and powerful of the Aegean islands. Despite its success, Naxos was not immune to class tensions and internal strife, and shortly before 500 BC, the population seized power, expelling the aristocrats and establishing a democracy.|$|E

5|$|The mid-fifteenth century {{suffered}} {{greatly from}} the private feuds of the nobility, and the Wars of the Roses in general. Devonshire, whilst experiencing none of the pitched battles, was still ravaged by a private feud. This was between Thomas Courtenay, Earl of Devon, whose family had been earls of that county since 1335 and William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville. Their feud became inextricably tied to the national political scene, but originated in regional Devon society. In 2003, historian Martin Cherry agreed that the south west was to a great degree lawless at this time. However, he suggested that the Bonville-Courtenay feud, whilst being the best-known, is not the sole example of <b>political</b> <b>upheaval</b> in the region, which was common throughout the century.|$|E

5|$|Abdullah was {{succeeded by}} his son Talal, who would soon abdicate due to illness in favour of his eldest son Hussein. Talal {{established}} the country's modern constitution in 1952. Hussein ascended to the throne in 1953 {{at the age of}} 18. Jordan witnessed great political uncertainty in the following period. The 1950s were a period of <b>political</b> <b>upheaval,</b> as Nasserism and Pan-Arabism swept the Arab World. On 1 March 1956, King Hussein Arabized the command of the Army by dismissing a number of senior British officers, an act made to remove remaining foreign influence in the country. In 1958, Jordan and neighbouring Hashemite Iraq formed the Arab Federation {{as a response to the}} formation of the rival United Arab Republic between Nasser's Egypt and Syria. The union lasted only six months, being dissolved after Iraqi King Faisal II (Hussein's cousin) was deposed by a bloody military coup on 14 July 1958.|$|E

Genoa was however, in common with other Northern Italian cities, in a state of <b>political</b> <b>upheaval.</b> The French Revolution had inspired similarly-minded revolutionaries in Italy to support Republican ideas, and there was a substantial Republican faction in the Genoese government which supported France's cause. Food supplies were regularly shipped from Genoa to the Republican armies in Southern France, and the demands of Francis Drake, Ambassador to Genoa, that this trade cease went unheeded.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} of Spira includes distinct ethnic minorities including a {{portrayal of the}} fictional Al Bhed language that is prevalent throughout the game's dialogue. The backstory and concept behind the dark religious themes of Final Fantasy X were a central theme to the story and their ultimate resolution was well received. The popularity of the Eternal Calm video served as the impetus of Square Enix to do Final Fantasy X-2 to make their first direct sequel in video game form and depict the evolution of Spiran society after religious and <b>political</b> <b>upheaval</b> results in new factions and instability in the world. Spira and its inhabiting characters have been featured in several other Square Enix works including Dissidia Final Fantasy, Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy and three games within the Kingdom Hearts series and Theatrhythm Final Fantasy.|$|E
5|$|The tax was {{rescinded}} by the British in 1812, {{who then}} imposed a British style constitution on the island. One legal innovation {{of this time}} of particular consequence for the aristocracy was that creditors, who had previously only been able to enforce repayments of the interest on a loan or mortgage, could now seize property. Property began to change hands in smaller parcels at auctions, and consequently a land-owning bourgeoisie immediately began to flourish. Revolts against the Bourbons in 1821, and 1848 divided the nobility, and liberalism was in the air. These factors coupled with the social and <b>political</b> <b>upheaval</b> of the following Risorgimento in the 19th century meant the Sicilian aristocracy was a doomed class. Furthermore, because of their neglect and dereliction of noblesse oblige, {{an essential element of}} the feudal system, the countryside was often ruled by bandits outside the enclosed villages, and the once grand country villas were decaying. The building mania of the Sicilian upper class was over.|$|E

5|$|A small {{platform}} {{was added}} to the East Platform in the Early Classic, the surface of the platform possesses a series of holes that may have supported banners. The platform covered a large pit that contained the bodies of seventeen sacrificial victims, including men, women and children, possibly sacrificed during a dedicatory ceremony for the platform itself. In the 4th century AD the first version of Structure 5D-82 was built, {{to the north of the}} East Platform. In the second half of the 4th century six tombs were built in the East Platform. Ceramic offerings in the tombs included effigy vessels representing monkeys and macaws. The high artistic and technical quality of the funerary offerings in these tombs identify the deceased as members of Tikal's elite; they may have been members of a line of the ruling dynasty that lost power among the <b>political</b> <b>upheaval</b> of the late 4th century and included the kings K'inichMuwaanJol and ChakTokIch'aakI. With the entry of Siyaj K'ak' and the establishment of a new political order in the city, the focus of royal funerary rites was shifted from the Mundo Perdido to the North Acropolis.|$|E
5|$|From one {{settlement}} in year 1, the Han Dynasty's {{involvement in the}} Minyue region grew into several counties. There were many Chinese counties in the area by the 4th century AD. The Minyue had been culturally assimilated {{by the time the}} Han Dynasty collapsed, and Chinese civilization was undergoing a transition to the Three Kingdoms period of Cao Wei, Shu Han, and Eastern Wu. <b>Political</b> <b>upheaval</b> in the north, such as Wang Mang's usurpation, had caused Han migrants to resettle in the south. The Han Dynasty's military expansion widened its commercial ties in addition acquiring large amounts of new territories. The empire's conquest of Minyue and Nanyue spoke of its vast size that it bordered the ancient kingdoms of Southeast Asia. Economic ties with the Han and subsequent dynasties affected the trajectory of maritime trade of Southeast Asia, where goods have been excavated made in styles resembling that of the ancient Han Chinese. Maritime trade and the Silk Road also linked China with Ancient Rome, India, and the Near East.|$|E
5|$|Morosini {{initiated}} a more energetic {{approach in the}} Venetian pursuit of the war: {{in the spring of}} 1655, he raided the Ottoman supply depot at Aigina and razed the port town of Volos in a night attack on 23 March. In early June, Morosini sailed to the Dardanelles, awaiting the sally of the Ottoman fleet, which was however delayed because of <b>political</b> <b>upheaval</b> in the Ottoman government. Leaving Lazzaro Mocenigo with half the fleet (36 ships) to keep watch at the Straits, Morosini returned to the Cyclades. A week after his departure however, on 21 June, the Ottoman fleet, numbering 143 ships under Mustapha Pasha, appeared. The resulting battle was a clear Venetian victory. The Ottoman fleet avoided action {{for the remainder of the}} year, before it withdrew to winter quarters, leaving Morosini free to undertake an ultimately unsuccessful siege of the strategically important island fortress of Malvasia (Monemvasia) off the south-eastern coast of the Peloponnese. In September, Morosini was posted as the new provveditore of Crete, with Lorenzo Marcello as the new Captain General of the Sea.|$|E
