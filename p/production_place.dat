The production line of Iwaya Shokai went to the Tokyo First Tobacco <b>Production</b> <b>Place,</b> {{and in the same}} year, Imperial tobacco began to be produced not only exclusively for noblemen, such as Emperor Taisho and his relatives, but also for its original purposes. Imperial tobacco was made from special leaves of tobacco, while the Special tobacco for noblemen and gifts was made from the finest Fuji leaf or 不二; these were also produced with the utmost care manually. Emperor Taisho was a smoker and smoked his exclusively produced cigarettes, while Hirohito did not; the production of Imperial tobacco, however, continued. The production of special tobacco for the relatives of the Emperor Hirohito was discontinued by the order of the General Headquarters of Japan of the allied forces in 1945.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we survey the flower bulb {{production}} {{area in the}} Netherland, England and Japan.

We show some features of narcissus production in England and mention some activities in the bulb <b>production</b> <b>place.</b> We conclude that narcissus sector has a strong position and exportable power in the flower bulb industry in England. One of the advantages is quality of narcissi, e. g. relatively large and strong flowers.

40|$|Surveys {{carried out}} on the Archaic to the Hellenistic-Roman <b>production</b> <b>places</b> for pottery and {{terracotta}} artifacts in Sicily show a rich variety in terms of typology and topographical location. This variety raises questions on the reasons that govern their location and spatial concentration; nevertheless {{it is interesting to}} verify if this situation corresponds to a diversification of the production in terms of either production capacity or specialization of products. It is, however, an investigation complicated by the different data at our disposal. Still not clear is actually the relationship established between the general grid pattern {{of the city and the}} production centers and between these latter and the information we possess about the origin, the development and the consumption of individual classes of materials. Nevertheless, on the basis of the carried examination, the Sicilian craftsmen seem to work, mostly, in small situations; they mainly respond to the needs of the community in which they live and its immediate area of political as well as commercial influence. This aspect had to have an impact on the location of the <b>production</b> <b>places.</b> There is, in fact, a close relationship between the <b>production</b> <b>places</b> and the direct consumption of the artefacts, suggested by the choice to place the kilns in prominent points of the urban area, close to the sacred areas, the cemeteries, and along the main accesses and routes of the city...|$|R
