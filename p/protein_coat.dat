5|$|Co-evolution {{hypothesis}} : This is {{also called}} the virus-first hypothesis and proposes that viruses may have evolved from complex molecules of protein and nucleic acid {{at the same time}} as cells first appeared on Earth and would have been dependent on cellular life for billions of years. Viroids are molecules of RNA that are not classified as viruses because they lack a <b>protein</b> <b>coat.</b> However, they have characteristics that are common to several viruses and are often called subviral agents. Viroids are important pathogens of plants. They do not code for proteins but interact with the host cell and use the host machinery for their replication. The hepatitis delta virus of humans has an RNA genome similar to viroids but has a <b>protein</b> <b>coat</b> derived from hepatitis B virus and cannot produce one of its own. It is, therefore, a defective virus. Although hepatitis delta virus genome may replicate independently once inside a host cell, it requires the help of hepatitis B virus to provide a <b>protein</b> <b>coat</b> so that it can be transmitted to new cells. In similar manner, the sputnik virophage is dependent on mimivirus, which infects the protozoan Acanthamoeba castellanii. These viruses, which are dependent on the presence of other virus species in the host cell, are called satellites and may represent evolutionary intermediates of viroids and viruses.|$|E
5|$|Poliovirus is {{composed}} of an RNA genome and a protein capsid. The genome is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome that is about 7500 nucleotides long. The viral particle is about 30 nm in diameter with icosahedral symmetry. Because of its short genome and its simple composition—only RNA and a nonenveloped icosahedral <b>protein</b> <b>coat</b> that encapsulates it, poliovirus {{is widely regarded as}} the simplest significant virus.|$|E
5|$|While not {{inside an}} {{infected}} cell {{or in the}} process of infecting a cell, viruses exist in the form of independent particles. These viral particles, also known as virions, consist of two or three parts: (i) the genetic material made from either DNA or RNA, long molecules that carry genetic information; (ii) a <b>protein</b> <b>coat,</b> called the capsid, which surrounds and protects the genetic material; and in some cases (iii) an envelope of lipids that surrounds the <b>protein</b> <b>coat</b> when they are outside a cell. The shapes of these virus particles range from simple helical and icosahedral forms for some virus species to more complex structures for others. Most virus species have virions that are too small to be seen with an optical microscope. The average virion is about one one-hundredth the size of the average bacterium.|$|E

25|$|Within {{the liver}} hepatocytes, the RNA genome is {{released}} from the <b>protein</b> <b>coat</b> and is translated by the cell's own ribosomes. Unlike other picornaviruses, this virus requires an intact eukaryote initiating factor 4G (eIF4G) for the initiation of translation. The requirement for this factor results in an inability to shut down host protein synthesis, unlike other picornaviruses. The virus must then inefficiently compete for the cellular translational machinery which may explain its poor growth in cell culture. Presumably for this reason, the virus has strategically adopted a naturally highly deoptimized codon usage with respect to that of its cellular host. Precisely how this strategy works is not quite clear yet.|$|E
25|$|Viruses are obligate {{intracellular}} parasites, {{characterized by}} extremely limited biological function, {{to the point}} where, while they are evidently able to infect all other organisms from bacteria and archaea to animals, plants and fungi, {{it is unclear whether}} they can themselves be described as living. Viruses consist of a strip of genetic material (DNA or RNA), covered in a <b>protein</b> <b>coat</b> and sometimes a lipid envelope. They thus lack all the usual machinery of the cell such as enzymes, relying entirely on the host cell's ability to replicate DNA and synthesise proteins. Most viruses are bacteriophages, infecting bacteria, and it is possible that viruses are both extremely ancient, being at least as old as the first cells, and polyphyletic, having evolved from several entirely unrelated ancestors.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} is further complicated when considering fusion in vivo since biological fusion {{is almost always}} regulated {{by the action of}} membrane-associated proteins. The first of these proteins to be studied were the viral fusion proteins, which allow an enveloped virus to insert its genetic material into the host cell (enveloped viruses are those surrounded by a lipid bilayer; some others have only a <b>protein</b> <b>coat).</b> Broadly, there are two classes of viral fusion proteins: acidic and pH-independent. pH independent fusion proteins can function under neutral conditions and fuse with the plasma membrane, allowing viral entry into the cell. Viruses utilizing this scheme included HIV, measles and herpes. Acidic fusion proteins such as those found on influenza are only activated when in the low pH of acidic endosomes and must first be endocytosed to gain entry into the cell.|$|E

40|$|GroEL recognizes {{proteins}} that are folding improperly or that have aggregation-prone intermediates. Here {{we have used}} as substrates for GroEL, wildtype (WT) <b>coat</b> <b>protein</b> of phage P 22 and 3 <b>coat</b> <b>proteins</b> that carry single amino acid substitutions leading to a temperature-sensitive folding (tsf) phenotype. In vivo, WT <b>coat</b> <b>protein</b> does not require GroEL for proper folding, whereas GroEL {{is necessary for the}} folding of the tsf coat proteins; thus, the single amino acid substitutions cause <b>coat</b> <b>protein</b> to become a substrate for GroEL. The conformation of WT and tsf <b>coat</b> <b>proteins</b> when in a binary complex with GroEL was investigated using tryptophan fluorescence, quenching of fluorescence, and accessibility of the <b>coat</b> <b>proteins</b> to proteolysis.

As an additional measure of the changes in the bound conformation, the affinity of binding of WT and tsf <b>coat</b> <b>proteins</b> to GroEL was determined using a fluorescence binding assay. The tsf <b>coat</b> <b>proteins</b> were bound more tightly by GroEL than WT <b>coat</b> <b>protein.</b> Therefore, even though the proteins are identical except for a single amino acid substitution, GroEL did not bind these substrate polypeptides in the same conformation within its central cavity.

25|$|A decade later, Davson and Danielli {{proposed}} a modification to this concept. In their model, the lipid bilayer was coated {{on either side}} {{with a layer of}} globular proteins. According to their view, this <b>protein</b> <b>coat</b> had no particular structure and was simply formed by adsorption from solution. Their theory was also incorrect in that it ascribed the barrier properties of the membrane to electrostatic repulsion from the protein layer rather than the energetic cost of crossing the hydrophobic core. A more direct investigation of the membrane was made possible through the use of electron microscopy in the late 1950s. After staining with heavy metal labels, Sjöstrand et al. noted two thin dark bands separated by a light region, which they incorrectly interpreted as a single molecular layer of protein. A more accurate interpretation was made by J. David Robertson, who determined that the dark electron-dense bands were the headgroups and associated proteins of two apposed lipid monolayers. In this body of work, Robertson put forward the concept of the “unit membrane.” This {{was the first time the}} bilayer structure had been universally assigned to all cell membranes as well as organelle membranes.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe <b>coat</b> <b>protein</b> of alfalfa mosaic {{virus has}} both {{structural}} and regulating functions. The latter {{is evident from}} the fact that the genomic RNAs of the virus, although they are of messenger polarity, cannot start an infection cycle in the absence of <b>coat</b> <b>protein.</b> The reason could be that the <b>coat</b> <b>protein</b> is needed for viral RNA synthesis. Indeed, the <b>coat</b> <b>protein</b> has been found in tight association with the viral RNA polymerase (R. Quadt et al., 1991, Virology 182, 309 - 315). To investigate the role of the <b>coat</b> <b>protein,</b> if any, in viral RNA synthesis, we have isolated the viral RNA polymerase (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, RdRp) from mock-inoculated tobacco plants transformed with cDNAs 1 and 2, known as P 12 plants (P. E M Taschner et al., 1991, Virology 181, 687 - 693), which express the nonstructural proteins P 1 and P 2. Such an enzyme (called M-RdRp) will contain the viral subunits P 1 and P 2 but not the <b>coat</b> <b>protein.</b> As a comparison we also isolated the RdRp from virion-inoculated P 12 plants (C-RdRp). This enzyme will contain the <b>coat</b> <b>protein.</b> We found that both M-RdRp and CRdRp could synthesize minus RNA, showing that <b>coat</b> <b>protein</b> is not needed for minus-strand synthesis. In contrast, minusstrand synthesis by both enzymes was inhibited by <b>coat</b> <b>protein.</b> Plus-strand synthesis was unaffected by <b>coat</b> <b>protein</b> in the case of C-RdRp, but strongly stimulated by <b>coat</b> <b>protein</b> in the case of M-RdRp. These data might explain why infected cells, which do not produce <b>coat</b> <b>protein,</b> display a very low accumulation of viral plus-strand RNA. They also give a possible explanation for the noninfectious character of the genomes of alfafa mosaic virus and ilarviruses in the absence of <b>coat</b> <b>protein.</b> The fact that an active enzyme could be isolated from the same membrane fraction in infected and noninfected P 12 plants shows that <b>coat</b> <b>protein</b> is not needed for assembly and targeting of the viral RNA polymerase...|$|R
