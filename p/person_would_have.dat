5|$|Much of Alvarado's trial {{focused on}} whether Alvarado was in custody or not during his police interview. According to Thompson v. Keohane, to {{determine}} whether someone is in custody the courts apply a reasonable person test: whether a reasonable <b>person</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> felt free to leave or not.|$|E
5|$|The murder notes {{had been}} {{analyzed}} before at the extraordinary motion hearing. Handwriting expert Albert S. Osborn reviewed the previous {{evidence at the}} commutation hearing and commented, for the first time, that the notes were written {{in the third person}} rather than the first person. He said that the first <b>person</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been more logical since they were intended to be the final statements of a dying Phagan. He argued this was the type of error that Conley would have made, rather than Frank, as Conley was a sweeper and not a Cornell-educated manager like Frank.|$|E
25|$|Jews, Christians, and Muslims {{have also}} at times used their holy books in a talisman-like manner in grave situations. For example, a bed-ridden and seriously ill <b>person</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> a holy book placed under {{part of the}} bed or cushion.|$|E

25|$|The {{question}} of A's beliefs is no different. If A honestly believes that B {{is only slightly}} injured and so could move himself out of danger without difficulty, how fair is {{it to say that}} he ought to have foreseen? The test is what the reasonable <b>person</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> known and foreseen, given what A had done. It is the function of any court to evaluate behaviour. A defendant cannot evade responsibility through a form of wilful blindness. Fault lies not only in what a person actually believes, but also in failing to understand what the vast majority of other people would have understood. Hence, the test is hybrid, looking both at what the defendant actually knew and foresaw (i.e. subjective), and at what the reasonable <b>person</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> known (i.e. objective) and then combining the conclusions into a general evaluation of the degree of fault or blameworthiness.|$|E
25|$|There are {{not many}} foods that {{naturally}} have vitamin D. Examples are cod liver oil and oily fish. If people cannot get sunlight, then they will need 1,000 IU of vitamin D per day to stay healthy. A <b>person</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to eat oily fish {{three or four times}} per week in order to get enough vitamin D from that food source alone.|$|E
25|$|Early in Islamic history, {{the only}} form of treason {{was seen as}} the attempt to {{overthrow}} a just government or waging war against the State. According to Islamic tradition, the prescribed punishment ranged from imprisonment to the severing of limbs and the death penalty depending on the severity of the crime. However, even in cases of treason the repentance of a <b>person</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to be taken into account.|$|E

25|$|An {{alternative}} method of vertical suspension {{is to use}} a bondage rope harness. With the ropes tied around the body and in particular around the upper arms close to the shoulders as well as around the upper leg and through the groin, it is possible to suspend a person with ropes attached to these areas similar to the way a parachute is attached to a person. In this position the arms and legs may be left to hang free, as the <b>person</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> great difficulty getting free without assistance.|$|E
25|$|The torso of an {{executed}} <b>person</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> normally {{been given}} to friends or family; but Montrose {{was the subject of}} an excommunication which was why it was originally buried in unconsecrated ground. In 1650 his niece, Lady Napier, had sent men by night to remove his heart. This relic she placed in a steel case made from his sword and placed the whole in a gold filigree box, which had been presented to her family by a Doge of Venice. The heart in its case was retained by the Napier family for several generations until lost amidst the confusion of the French Revolution.|$|E
25|$|Before this {{landmark}} case, pre-trial involuntary {{commitment of}} incompetent individuals often meant lengthy or even lifetime confinement in a maximum security institution with little concern for treatment. This was true {{even though they}} were neither tried for or convicted of a crime. In this case, the Court for the first time put limits on the length of time an incompetent person may be confined. However, the Court offers only general guidelines and by 1994, twenty years after the case, 32 states still had not enacted periodic judicial review of incompetent detainees. Many states still allowed a detention period that exceeded that maximum sentence that <b>person</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> received if convicted.|$|E
25|$|The <b>persons</b> {{mentioned}} <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{been only}} {{the heads of}} families, and so {{the total population of}} the manor (on the usual reckoning of 4.5 <b>persons</b> per family) <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been in the region of 200 people.|$|R
50|$|A {{retrospective}} or {{retroactive award}} is {{one which is}} created and then awarded to <b>persons</b> who <b>would</b> <b>have</b> received it before. Alternatively, a slight change to the criteria of an existing award may result in retrospective awards being presented to <b>persons</b> who <b>would</b> <b>have</b> won the award under present rules. Comparatively few awards are presented retrospectively.|$|R
25|$|There {{is also a}} {{suggestion}} that the religious doctrine held by the accused persons was relevant {{to the issue of}} whether the content was objectionable or seditious. If the accused persons had religious beliefs {{similar to that of the}} tracts' author, it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been unlikely that reasonable individuals in the position of the accused <b>persons</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> thought that the content was objectionable or seditious.|$|R
25|$|The americium-241 in {{ionizing}} {{smoke detectors}} poses a potential environmental hazard, albeit {{a very small}} one. Disposal regulations and recommendations for smoke detectors vary from region to region. The amount of radioactive material contained in ionizing smoke detectors is very small and thus doesn't represent a significant radiological hazard. If the americium is left in the ionization chamber of the alarm the radiological risk is insignificant because the chamber acts as a shield to the alpha radiation. A <b>person</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to open the sealed chamber and ingest or inhale the americium for the risk to be significant. The radiation risk of exposure to an ionic smoke detector is much smaller than natural background radiation under normal operation.|$|E
25|$|Psychiatrists and {{clinical}} psychologists are often asked {{to evaluate a}} patient's capacity for making life-and-death decisions {{at the end of}} life. Persons with a psychiatric condition such as delirium or clinical depression may lack capacity to make end-of-life decisions. For these persons, a request to refuse treatment may be taken {{in the context of their}} condition. Unless there is a clear advance directive to the contrary, persons lacking mental capacity are treated according to their best interests. This will involve an assessment involving people who know the person best to what decisions the <b>person</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> made had they not lost capacity. Persons with the mental capacity to make end-of-life decisions may refuse treatment with the understanding that it may shorten their life. Psychiatrists and psychologists may be involved to support decision making.|$|E
25|$|Originally a {{sub-category}} {{of direct}} discrimination, harassment {{is now an}} independent tort which requires no comparator. The Protection from Harassment Act 1997, and now the Equality Act 2010 sections 26 and 40, define harassment as where a person's dignity is violated, or the person is subject to an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment. An employer will be liable for its own conduct, but also conduct of employees, or customers if this happens on 2 or more occasions and the employer could be reasonably expected to have intervened. In a straightforward case, in Majrowski v Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Trust a gay man was ostracised and bossed about by his supervisor {{from the very start}} of his work as a clinical audit co-ordinator. The House of Lords held the laws create a statutory tort, for which (unless a statute says otherwise) an employer is automatically vicariously liable. Under the Equality Act 2010 section 27, an employer must also ensure that once a complaint is brought by a worker, even if it ultimately proves to be unfounded, that worker should not be victimised. This means the worker should not be subject to anything that a reasonable person would perceive as detrimental. In St Helen’s MBC v Derbyshire the House of Lords held a council victimised female staff who were pursuing an equal pay claim when it sent letters warning (without much factual basis) that if the claim went ahead, the council would be forced to cut school dinners and make redundancies. Because it attempted to make the workers feel guilty, a reasonable <b>person</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> regarded this as a detriment. By contrast, in Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police v Khan, a sergeant with a pending race discrimination claim was denied a reference by the employer that he was suing. The House of Lords held this could not be considered victimisation because the Constabulary was only seeking to protect its legitimate interests by not giving a reference, so as to not prejudice its own future case in the discrimination hearings.|$|E
50|$|It was {{reported}} that 30% of the population would likely fall ill within six months, and that half of those would be confined to their beds. Ultimately, {{one out of every}} two <b>persons</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> acquired the disease at some point. This meant that about 700,000 Norwegians <b>would</b> <b>have</b> fallen ill, and in this period, 700 to 3,000 more deaths than a regular influenza season were to be expected.|$|R

50|$|American {{economist}} and political philosopher Fred E. Foldvary {{coined the term}} geo-libertarianism in a same-titled article appearing in the magazine Land and Liberty. In the case of geoanarchism, the most radically decentralized and scrupulously voluntarist form of geolibertarianism, Foldvary theorizes, ground rents would be collected by private agencies and <b>persons</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> the opportunity to secede from associated geocommunities—thereby opting out of their protective and legal services—if desired.|$|R
25|$|Several {{additions}} {{had been}} built onto the original structure between 1970 and 1976, creating a sprawling, non-linear complex of function rooms and service areas. The resulting complex was roughly square in shape, and {{though it was not}} situated in a north-south direction, reports of the fire have tended to assign those points to points in the complex for ease of reference. Assuming this system, the front entrance of the complex lay at the southern point of the compass. Along the central portion of the southern wall, to the east of the building entrance, was a small event room called the Zebra Room. A narrow corridor to the Zebra Room's east separated it from the Viennese Room and a series of service spaces, which ran northward along the building's eastern wall. This interior corridor terminated between the Garden Room, occupying the central portion of the north wall of the building, and the Cabaret Room, which jutted out from the northeastern corner of the building. A smaller, branching corridor led from the internal corridor to an exit door that sat between the Garden Room and the Cabaret Room; to exit the building from the Cabaret Room using that corridor, a <b>person</b> <b>would</b> <b>have,</b> in order, pass through a set of double doors into the main interior corridor, pass through a single door between the main interior corridor and the branching interior corridor, turn a sharp corner into the branching corridor, and proceed approximately one-quarter of the length of the Cabaret Room to the single door that connected the branching corridor to the exterior of the building. This complex navigation was not atypical for the building; a number of other event and services spaces were scattered {{throughout the rest of the}} building, with some rooms leading into each other, some leading into interior hallways, and some leading to the outside of the building. A partial second story covered approximately the southern third of the building, sitting above the main entrance, Zebra Room, and main dining room; it held two more small event rooms made of six smaller rooms conjoined, collectively labeled the Crystal Rooms.|$|E

To criminalize command decisions in a theater of complex combat operations is a grave step indeed. It is also unnecessary, particularly in this case. It is possible for officers to err in judgment—and to thereby incur censure—without violating a criminal statute. This is particularly true where the errors are those of omission, where the standards come from multiple non-punitive doctrinal publications, where there is less than complete and certain knowledge of enemy capabilities and intent, and where commanders enjoy wide discretion in their exercise of their command prerogatives and responsibilities.|$|E
500|$|How {{the work}} was {{obtained}} and for what purpose is also a factor. If {{the work was}} obtained illegally or unethically, the dealing {{is less likely to}} be [...] "fair" [...] than if it was legitimately acquired. Similarly, if the motives of the dealing are negative, the fairness will be impugned. As in Hyde Park, the court must [...] "judge the fairness by the objective standard of whether a fair minded and honest <b>person</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> dealt with the copyright work in the manner" [...] in question. Consequences are also a factor; if, as in Hubbard v Vosper, the parties to the case are competitors and infringing on the work acts as an alternative to purchasing the original, this will limit the fairness of the dealing. Occasionally the courts will also consider whether the purpose of the infringement could have been achieved in a less intrusive way, as in Hyde Park.|$|E

500|$|Writing for a {{majority}} of the Court, Justice Anthony Kennedy held that Drayton and Brown were not seized and their consent to the search was voluntary. He explained that [...] "aw enforcement officers do not violate the Fourth Amendment's prohibition of unreasonable seizures merely by approaching individuals on the street or in other public places and putting questions to them if they are willing to listen". Additionally, Justice Kennedy emphasized that [...] "f a reasonable person would feel free to terminate the encounter, then he or she has not been seized". Citing the Court's analytic framework established in Florida v. Bostic, Justice Kennedy concluded that a reasonable <b>person</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> felt free to [...] "leav the bus or otherwise terminat the encounter". Justice Kennedy noted that the officers did not brandish weapons, they did not make [...] "intimidating movements", they left the aisle clear, and they [...] "spoke to passengers one by one and in a polite, quiet voice". He noted that [...] "t is beyond question that had this encounter occurred on the street, it would be constitutional", {{and the fact that the}} encounter occurred on a bus does not make it illegal.|$|E
