Edible vegetable oils {{are used in}} food, both in cooking and as supplements. Many oils, edible and otherwise, are burned as fuel, such as in oil lamps and {{as a substitute for}} petroleum-based fuels. Some of the many other uses include wood finishing, oil painting, and skin care.|$|E
5|$|Samarium salts stimulate metabolism, but it {{is unclear}} whether this is the effect of {{samarium}} or other lanthanides present with it. The total amount of samarium in adults is about 50µg, mostly in liver and kidneys and with about 8µg/L being dissolved in the blood. Samarium is not absorbed by plants to a measurable concentration and therefore is normally not a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>human</b> diet. However, a few plants and vegetables may contain up to 1 part per million of samarium. Insoluble salts of samarium are non-toxic and the soluble ones are only slightly toxic.|$|E

Some positive health effects have been seen at dietary intake levels of 6–10mg/day. The only definitive side effect of excess lutein consumption is bronzing of the skin (carotenodermia).|$|E

Ancient Egyptians believed that {{the shadow of a}} person was an intrinsic <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>human</b> make-up, and Omm Sety noted that the peasants of modern Egypt held similar beliefs and treated the shadow with caution.|$|E

25|$|Common {{ostriches}} {{have inspired}} cultures and civilizations for 5,000 years in Mesopotamia and Egypt. A statue of Arsinoe II of Egypt riding a common ostrich {{was found in}} a tomb in Egypt. Hunter-gatherers in the Kalahari use ostrich eggshells as water containers, punching a hole in them. They also produce jewelry from it. The presence of such eggshells with engraved hatched symbols dating from the Howiesons Poort period of the Middle Stone Age at Diepkloof Rock Shelter in South Africa suggests common ostriches were an important <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>human</b> life as early as 60,000 BP.|$|E

25|$|After her First Communion {{at the age}} of nine, she practised {{in secret}} severe {{corporal}} mortification, until rheumatic fever confined her to bed for four years. At the end of this period, having made a vow to the Blessed Virgin to consecrate herself to religious life, she was instantly restored to perfect health. In recognition of this favor, she added the name Mary to her baptismal name of Margaret. According to her later account of her life, she had visions of Jesus Christ, which she thought were a normal <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>human</b> experience and continued to practice austerity.|$|E
25|$|Wilhelm Reich {{commented that}} sex {{education}} {{of his time}} was a work of deception, focusing on biology while concealing excitement-arousal, which is what a pubescent individual is mostly interested in. Reich added that this emphasis obscures what he {{believed to be a}} basic psychological principle: that all worries and difficulties originate from unsatisfied sexual impulses. Leepson asserted that the majority of people favor some sort of sex instruction in public schools, and this has become an intensely controversial issue because, unlike most subjects, sex education is concerned with an especially sensitive and highly personal <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>human</b> life. He suggested that sex education should be taught in the classroom.|$|E
25|$|As an {{integral}} <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>human</b> culture and civilization, shoes {{have found their}} way into our culture, folklore, and art. A popular 18th century nursery rhyme is There was an Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe. This story tells about an old woman living in a shoe with a lot of children. In 1948, Mahlon Haines, a shoe salesman in Hallam, Pennsylvania, built an actual house shaped like a work boot as a form of advertisement. The Haines Shoe House was rented to newlyweds and the elderly until his death in 1962. Since then, it has served as an ice cream parlor, a bed and breakfast, and a museum. It still stands today and is a popular roadside attraction.|$|E

The Day of Resurrection is not a global event, but something, that each person will experience for themselves. Therefore the Dajjal is the <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>humans</b> consciousness, which claims to be God. Then a human trust his inner Dajjal, he believes to be his physical body and an independend self, leading to bodily desires.

25|$|In what {{is arguably}} her most {{influential}} work, The Human Condition (1958), Arendt differentiates {{political and social}} concepts, labor and work, and various forms of actions; she then explores the implications of those distinctions. Her theory of political action, corresponding {{to the existence of}} a public realm, is extensively developed in this work. Arendt argues that, while human life always evolves within societies, the social <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>human</b> nature, political life, has been intentionally realized in only a few societies as a space for individuals to achieve freedom. Conceptual categories, which attempt {{to bridge the gap between}} ontological and sociological structures, are sharply delineated. While Arendt relegates labor and work to the realm of the social, she favors the human condition of action as that which is both existential and aesthetic.|$|E
25|$|Current {{migration}} policy rarely {{takes into account}} circular migration, instead mainly focusing on the dichotomous concepts of “permanent” and “temporary.” In contrast to temporary migration, circular migration allows the worker to simultaneously be engaged with both the home and host countries. Furthermore, it typically involves both return to the country of origin and repeated moves to the destination country. In many ways, being connected to both places provides an advantage for the migrant worker, {{because they do not}} have to make a definitive choice to stay in one. This allows for the maximization of capabilities, a concept articulated by Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum. By working in a high-income location with better earnings and spending in low-income, low-cost countries, the migrant worker is able to realize the best capabilities for both themselves and their families. Circularity also allows for the maintenance of traditions, citizenship, and family, an important <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>human</b> capabilities.|$|E
25|$|People {{during the}} Middle Paleolithic, {{such as the}} Neanderthals and Middle Paleolithic Homo sapiens in Africa, began to catch {{shellfish}} for food as revealed by shellfish cooking in Neanderthal sites in Italy about 110,000 years ago and in Middle Paleolithic Homo sapiens sites at Pinnacle Point, Africa around 164,000BP. Although fishing only became common during the Upper Paleolithic, fish have been <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>human</b> diets long before {{the dawn of the}} Upper Paleolithic and have certainly been consumed by humans since at least the Middle Paleolithic. For example, the Middle Paleolithic Homo sapiens in the region now occupied by the Democratic Republic of the Congo hunted large -long catfish with specialized barbed fishing points as early as 90,000 years ago. The invention of fishing allowed some Upper Paleolithic and later hunter-gatherer societies to become sedentary or semi-nomadic, which altered their social structures. Example societies are the Lepenski Vir as well as some contemporary hunter-gatherers, such as the Tlingit. In some instances (at least the Tlingit), they developed social stratification, slavery, and complex social structures such as chiefdoms.|$|E

The effects of mechanical force on the living thing can be noticed the most obviously within human’ s motor and sensory functions. The force of gravity constantly influences human body, with a tendency to pull certain <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>human</b> body towards the earth. Active and passive powers <b>of</b> <b>human</b> organism oppose it, trying to keep the <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>human</b> body within physiologica llimits. The muscles are the only active power in human organism, while bones, joints, and ligaments are the passive power. All powers that maintain normal upright posture should be in balance. Prevailing of the muscular power leads to upright posture and movement, while the prevailing of the forces of gravity leads to immobility, rest and the disturbance of body posture, {{as well as to the}} appearance of definite body deformities...|$|R
