5000|$|There are {{two main}} forms of PDS: Collinear and Transverse. Collinear PDS was {{introduced}} in a 1980 paper by A.C. Boccara, D. Fournier, et al. In collinear, two beams pass through and intersect in a medium. The pump beam heats the material and the <b>probe</b> <b>beam</b> is deflected. This technique only works for transparent media. In transverse, the <b>probe</b> <b>beam</b> heats come in normal to the surface, and the <b>probe</b> <b>beam</b> passes parallel. In a variation on this, the <b>probe</b> <b>beam</b> may reflect off the surface, and measure buckling due to heating. Transverse PDS {{can be done in}} Nitrogen, but better performance is gained in a liquid cell: usually an inert, non-absorbing material such as a perfluorocarbon is used.|$|E
5000|$|The {{conventional}} photo-reflectance experimental setup uses a xenon or tungsten based lamp source {{passed through}} a monochromator to form the incident <b>probe</b> <b>beam.</b> The pump beam may be formed by the output of a continuous wave (CW) laser (e.g. a He-Ne or He-Cd laser) passed though a chopper wheel, or may be formed by the output of a directly modulated semiconductor diode laser. The pump beam is focused to {{a spot on the}} sample where it interacts with the sample. The <b>probe</b> <b>beam</b> is co-focused onto the sample where it is reflected. The reflected <b>probe</b> <b>beam</b> is collected and {{passed through a}}n optical filter to eliminate any unwanted pump light and/or photoluminescence signal. Thereafter the <b>probe</b> <b>beam</b> is directed onto a photodetector (e.g. a Si or InGaAs photodiode), which converts the probe intensity to an electrical signal. The electrical signal is processed to eliminate unwanted noise, typically using a lock-in circuit referenced to the modulation frequency. The photo-reflectance signal is then recorded as a function of <b>probe</b> <b>beam</b> wavelength using a computer or the like.12 ...|$|E
5000|$|However, {{by the mid}} 2000s, new {{manufacturing}} processes were requiring new process control capabilities, for example the need for control of new [...] "diffusion-less" [...] annealing processes and advanced strained silicon processes. To address these new process control requirements, in 2007, Xitronix Corporation introduced a photo-reflectance system to the semiconductor process control market. Like the Therma-Probe, the Xitronix metrology system utilized a fixed wavelength <b>probe</b> <b>beam</b> generated by a laser. However, the <b>probe</b> <b>beam</b> of the Xitronix system had a wavelength of approximately 375 nanometers, near the first major interband transition in silicon. At this wavelength the electro-modulation signal is dominant, which enabled the Xitronix system to precisely measure active doping concentration in diffusion-less annealing processes. This <b>probe</b> <b>beam</b> wavelength also provided excellent sensitivity to strain in strained silicon processes.|$|E

50|$|As {{the pump}} and the <b>probe</b> <b>beam</b> {{must have the}} same exact frequency, the most {{convenient}} solution {{is for them to}} come from the same laser. The <b>probe</b> <b>beam</b> can be made of a reflection of the pump beam passed through neutral density filter to reduce its intensity. To fine-tune the frequency of the laser, a diode laser with a piezoelectric transducer that controls the cavity wavelength can be used. Due to photodiode noise, the laser frequency can be swept across the transition and the photodiode reading averaged over many sweeps.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{influence}} of two resonant laser beams (to {{be referred to as}} the control and <b>probe</b> <b>beams)</b> on the centre of mass motion of ultra-cold atoms characterised by three energy levels of the Lambda-type. The laser beams being in the Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) configuration drive the atoms to their dark states. We impose the adiabatic approximation and obtain an effective equation of motion for the dark state atoms. The equation contains a vector potential type interaction as well as an effective trapping potential. We concentrate on the situation where the control and <b>probe</b> <b>beams</b> are co-propagating and have Orbital Angular Momenta (OAM). The effective magnetic field is then oriented along the propagation direction of the control and <b>probe</b> <b>beams.</b> Its spatial profile can be shaped by choosing proper laser beams. We analyse several situations where the effective magnetic field exhibits a radial dependence. In particular we study effective magnetic fields induced by Bessel beams, and demonstrate how to generate a constant effective magnetic field for a ring geometry of the atomic trap. We also discuss a possibility to create an effective field of a magnetic monopole. Comment: 2 figure...|$|R

50|$|The CARS {{process can}} be {{physically}} explained by using either a classical oscillator model or by using a quantum mechanical model that incorporates the energy levels of the molecule. Classically, the Raman active vibrator is modeled as a (damped) harmonic oscillator with a characteristic frequency of ωv. In CARS, this oscillator is not driven by a single optical wave, but by the difference frequency (ωp-ωS) between the pump and the Stokes beams instead. This driving mechanism is similar to hearing the low combination tone when striking two different high tone piano keys: your ear is sensitive to the difference frequency of the high tones. Similarly, the Raman oscillator is susceptible to the difference frequency of two optical waves. When the difference frequency ωp-ωS approaches ωv, the oscillator is driven very efficiently. On a molecular level, this implies that the electron cloud surrounding the chemical bond is vigorously oscillating with the frequency ωp-ωS. These electron motions alter the optical properties of the sample, i.e. there is a periodic modulation of the refractive index of the material. This periodic modulation can be probed by a third laser beam, the <b>probe</b> <b>beam.</b> When the <b>probe</b> <b>beam</b> is propagating through the periodically altered medium, it acquires the same modulation. Part of the probe, originally at ωpr will now get modified to ωpr+ωp-ωS, which is the observed anti-Stokes emission. Under certain beam geometries, the anti-Stokes emission may diffract away from the <b>probe</b> <b>beam,</b> and can be detected in a separate direction.|$|E

Due to the photoheating effect, the coupling efficiency is changed and characterized to indicate the thin film absorption.|$|E

It is found that {{the intensity of the}} phase conjugate signal resulting from degenerate four-wave mixing using pump and <b>probe</b> <b>beams</b> with parallel polarisation states increases dramatically on heating by a factor of ∼ 10, reaching a maximum at ∼ 100 °C. The intensity of the phase conjugate signal for the case with crossed polarisation states of the pump and <b>probe</b> <b>beams</b> drops monotonically with increasing temperature. For both configurations the response time shortens with increasing temperature.

When {{only one of the}} two sublattices is selectively excited by the <b>probe</b> <b>beams</b> that aremomentum-matched onto theDirac points, a singly-charged optical vortex emerges in the output of the symmetric conical diffraction pattern. Furthermore, flipping of the topological charge is observed as the excitation shifts from sublattice A to sublattice B.
