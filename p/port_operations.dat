5|$|The Port of Ploče {{recorded}} a steady {{growth and development}} from 1945, but suffered a sharp decline between 1991 and 1996 due to the Croatian War of Independence and the Bosnian War. In the late 2000s, Luka Ploče d.d., the primary concessionaire of the Port of Ploče, embarked on an ambitious investment plan, aiming for {{a substantial increase in}} the volume of <b>port</b> <b>operations.</b> Funding was secured in 2007, and Luka Ploče d.d. plans to invest €91million in port infrastructure and around €180million in port equipment by 2014.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, the Port of Split {{recorded}} {{a total of}} 16,527 ship arrivals, and handled 2.7million tonnes of cargo. In 2008, Luka d.d. Split, the primary cargo concessionaire company of the Port of Split, recorded substantial growth of transshipment volume. In {{the first nine months}} of the year, the company handled 276,000tonnes of cargo, representing a growth rate of 20% achieved by that company. The cargo volume projected for the entire year was estimated at 345,000tonnes, including 6,170TEUs. The growth was permitted by investments made in late 2007, and the increased volume of operation brought about profit of approximately 2.4million kuna (325,000euro) in {{the first nine months of}} 2008. Overall <b>port</b> <b>operations</b> continue to grow, as 18,000 arrivals were recorded by 2010. Director of the Split Port Authority is Joško Berket Bakota.|$|E
5|$|XXBomber Command's {{attacks on}} Singapore {{produced}} mixed results. The raids on Singapore Naval Base {{damaged or destroyed}} many workshops and denied the Japanese {{the use of the}} King GeorgeVI Graving Dock between late 1944 and early 1945, and the AdmiraltyIX Dry Dock from February 1945. In addition, workers at the Naval Base did not return to work for some time after each raid, and had to be provided with better pay and rations and additional air-raid shelters. Although the damage inflicted on the Empire Docks area impeded Japanese <b>port</b> <b>operations,</b> the poor condition of the port area also hindered British efforts to rehabilitate Singapore following the war. The attacks on the oil storage tanks on islands near Singapore were less successful, and many were found to still be operable after the Japanese surrender.|$|E

5|$|Janet {{made its}} final {{landfall}} in the Mexican state of Veracruz between {{the cities of}} Nautla and Veracruz as a Category2 hurricane at 2200UTC on September29. In Nautla, communications were cut by strong winds from the hurricane. The strong winds also caused a relief plane to crash, causing five deaths. Heavy rains in the Tampico, Tamaulipas area added to floods caused by hurricanes Gladys and Hilda earlier in the year. The resulting flood was reported by the Weather Bureau office in New Orleans {{to be one of}} the worst natural disasters in Mexican history. In Tampico, 16in (410mm) of rain was reported. The floods contributed to a localized typhoid fever and dysentery outbreak, causing over 1,000people to evacuate out of the city to prevent further spreading of the diseases. An additional 36,000people were being cared for in concentration centers. Although located south of where Janet made landfall, areas of Veracruz were inundated by strong storm surge, including the city's main streets and <b>port.</b> <b>Operations</b> along a railroad stretching from Laredo, Texas to Mexico City were stopped, after having just reopened due to Hurricane Hilda.|$|E

40|$|The main aim of {{the article}} is {{modelling}} the operation process of the Baltic Port, Shipping and Ship Traffic and <b>Port</b> <b>Operation</b> Information Critical Infrastructure Network. To achieve this goal {{it is necessary to}} define three critical infrastructure networks for a Baltic Sea Region and their <b>operation</b> processes: <b>port</b> critical infrastructure network, shipping critical infrastructure network and ship traffic and <b>port</b> <b>operation</b> information critical infrastructure network. Thus, the concept of networks of three networks, called Baltic Port, Shipping and Ship Traffic and <b>Port</b> <b>Operation</b> Information Critical Infrastructure Network, is introduced.

25|$|The Port of Buenos Aires is {{operated}} by the state-owned General Port Administration. It was originally established in 1949 by President Juan Perón as the Dirección Nacional de Puertos (National Port Directorate), and oversaw all major <b>port</b> <b>operations</b> in Argentina. The entity was reorganized as the Administración General de Puertos by President Raúl Alfonsín on 4 September 1987. Chronic losses, which by the early 1990s averaged over us$60 million yearly, prompted its 1992 privatization by President Carlos Menem.

40|$|Due to the {{occurrence}} of abnormal global environmental change, the concept of sustainable development {{becomes more and more}} important. Port {{plays an important role in}} economic development for a country. To tackle the environmental pollution coming from the construction and <b>operation</b> of a <b>port,</b> the green concept emerged as a solution. Founded on the previous literatures, the current study formulates a Fuzzy AHP model including five dimensions and thirteen factors as the guidelines for green <b>port</b> <b>operation.</b> The results of empirical study point out the top five priority attributes of green <b>port</b> <b>operation</b> which are: hazardous waste handling, air pollution, water pollution, port greenery, and habitat quality maintenance. The FAHP model is a good referral for decision makers of port organizations to forge a “greener” port operation; it also can be used to evaluate the <b>port’s</b> green <b>operation</b> performance...|$|R

25|$|Societé Nationale des Transports Ferrovaires, Algeria's {{state-owned}} railway company, suffered track damage {{near the}} town of Thénia. Some tracks were also blocked by debris of destroyed buildings. Eighteen bridges in the affected region had minor to moderate damage. Cracks developed in some roads and highways. The port of Algiers, which at that time handled approximately 40% of the national cargo traffic, suffered light to moderate damage due to soil liquefaction and settlement caused by the earthquake. <b>Port</b> <b>operations</b> was reportedly reduced by 30% immediately after the quake. The minor ports in Zemmouri and Dellys received little damage. The airport control tower and terminal were moderately damaged.|$|E
25|$|In {{the months}} after the conflict, the Portuguese Government used {{broadcasts}} on Emissora Nacional, the Portuguese national radio station, to urge Goans to resist and oppose the Indian administration. An {{effort was made to}} create clandestine resistance movements in Goa, and within Goan diaspora communities across the world to use general resistance and armed rebellion to weaken the Indian presence in Goa. The campaign had the full support of the Portuguese government with the ministries of defence, foreign affairs, army, navy and finance involved. A plan was chalked out called the 'Plano Gralha' covering Goa, Daman and Diu, which called for paralysing <b>port</b> <b>operations</b> at Mormugao and Bombay by planting bombs in some of the ships anchored at the ports.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in the 1920s, {{the city}} planned {{to develop a}} large ship and rail {{terminal}} along Jamaica Bay, particularly along the Paerdegat Basin in nearby Canarsie, to relieve <b>port</b> <b>operations</b> in the greater New York Harbor. The project would have constructed new rail facilities {{to connect with the}} Long Island Rail Road, New York Connecting Railroad, and a proposed rail tunnel to Staten Island. Around this time, a street grid was mapped in Spring Creek, though most of the streets had yet to be constructed. In 1930, Spring Creek Park and the Shore Parkway portion of the Belt Parkway were proposed by Robert Moses, along with several other parks and highways. Land for both projects along Jamaica Bay in the area was acquired via condemnation in 1938, and Shore Parkway opened in 1940, with an interchange to the south end of Pennsylvania Avenue. This {{put an end to the}} proposed Jamaica Bay seaport. Later plans by Robert Moses in the 1950s called for Spring Creek Park to extend to Cross Bay Boulevard in Howard Beach, Queens and include a new beach and boat basin.|$|E

25|$|In 2000, the Government of Canada re-organized the {{operation}} of <b>port</b> <b>operations</b> in Canada, including {{the formation of the}} Toronto Port Authority (TPA) to replace the Harbour Commission as the operator of Toronto Harbour and the island airport, with a focus on self-sufficiency and business practices. The new agency's plans to expand usage at the airport to erase its deficit, awoke a long-simmering disagreement between community groups and Toronto politicians wishing to close the airport and the business community which supported the expansion of its usage. The TPA welcomed a new regional airline Porter Airlines and started construction of a bridge to the airport in 2003. The bridge to the airport became a mayoral election issue and the City of Toronto forced its cancellation. Despite the opposition, the TPA bought new passenger ferries and built new facilities for passengers. For its part, Porter built a new passenger terminal. Increases in flights and a new passenger user fee imposed by the TPA led to the airport becoming self-sufficient by 2010. In 2012, the TPA began a project to link the airport to Toronto with a pedestrian tunnel, funded by the passenger user fee, which is intended to facilitate a further increase in flights. In 2013, Porter proposed to expand the airport to fly jets from the airport, but this was cancelled in 2015.|$|E
25|$|Chennai Port, {{formerly}} known as Madras Port, is the second largest container port of India, behind the Nhava Sheva Port, and the largest port in the Bay of Bengal. It is the third oldest port among the 13 major ports of India with official <b>port</b> <b>operations</b> beginning in 1881, although maritime trade started much earlier in 1639 on the undeveloped shore. It is an artificial and all-weather port with wet docks. Once a major travel port, it become a major container port in the post-Independence era. The port remains a primary reason for the economic growth of Tamil Nadu, especially for the manufacturing boom in South India, and has contributed greatly {{to the development of}} the city. It is due of the existence of the port that the city of Chennai eventually became known as the Gateway of South India. The port has become a hub port for containers, cars and project cargo in the east coast of India. From handling a meagre volume of cargo in the early years of its existence, consisting chiefly of imports of oil and motors and the export of groundnuts, granite and ores, the port has started handling more than 60 million tonnes of cargo in recent years. In 2008, the port's container traffic crossed 1 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs). It is currently ranked the 86th largest container port in the world and there are plans to expand the capacity to about 140 million tonnes per annum. It is an ISO 14001:2004 and ISPS-certified port and has become a main line port having direct connectivity to more than 50 ports around the world.|$|E
