40|$|With {{the aim of}} {{reducing}} {{the environmental impacts of}} <b>poultry</b> <b>feed,</b> <b>a</b> database of the impacts of feed components destined for formulation was constructed using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method. We used linear programming to create least cost feed formulas for fast-growing broiler (FGB), slow-growing broiler (SGB, i. e. quality label), laying hen and for three contrasting feed-cost situations (January 2006, December 2007 and March 2009). We focused on Eutrophication Potential (EP, a regional impact) and Climate Change (CC, a global impact) which were constraints to formulate low-impact poultry feed. The effects of using these constraints on feed cost and the use of feed components were investigated for a feed production plant in Bretagne (western France). Environmental impacts of poultry feed increased with the energy and protein content of the formula and were affected by the relative costs of feed components. FGB formulas had the highest impacts, followed by formulas for SGB and laying hens. The search for a minimum level of EP and CC of the formula decreased its impacts by 1 - 8 % and by 1 - 12 % respectively, and increased its cost by 2 - 8 %, {{depending on the type of}} feed and the feed-cost situation. Impact reduction was obtained by partial substitution of soybean meal and cereals by rapeseed meal, grain legumes and co-products (wheat bran, gluten). Furthermore, 70 % of the potential reduction of the EP and CC impacts could be obtained at a modest (0. 5 - 4 %) increase in the cost of the formulas. Some other ways to reduce feed impacts were explored, such as taking into account the geographic origin of maize crops and adopting a modified regulatory constraint for SGB formulas. It is important to continue this study by taking into account the whole life cycle of poultry production. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceGrain Science and IndustryCassandra K. JonesFeed mill {{biosecurity}} is {{a growing}} concern for the feed industries, especially since the entry of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDV) to the United States. Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDV) is primarily transmitted by fecal-oral contamination. However, research has confirmed swine feed and ingredients as potential vectors of transmission, so strategies are needed to mitigate PEDV in feed. The objective of the first experiment was {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} various chemical additives to prevent or mitigate PEDV in swine feed and ingredients that had been contaminated post-processing. Time, formaldehyde, medium chain fatty acids, essential oils, and organic acids all enhance the degradation of PEDV RNA in swine feed and ingredients, but their effectiveness varies within matrix. Notably, the medium chain fatty acids were equally as successful at mitigating PEDV as a commercially-available formaldehyde product. Salmonella is also another potential feed safety hazard in animal feed ingredients. Thermal mitigation of Salmonella in ingredients and feed manufacturing is effective, but it does not eliminate the potential for cross contamination. Therefore, the objective of the second experiment was to evaluate the effectiveness of chemicals to mitigate Salmonella cross-contamination in rendered proteins over time. Both chemical treatment and time reduced Salmonella concentrations, but their effectiveness was again matrix dependent. Chemical treatment with medium chain fatty acids or a commercial formaldehyde product was most effective at mitigating Salmonella in rendered protein meals. The final experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a dry granular acid, sodium bisulfate (SBS; Jones-Hamilton, Co., Waldridge, OH), to mitigate contamination of Salmonella in <b>poultry</b> <b>feed.</b> <b>A</b> surrogate organism, Enterococcus faecium, was utilized for this research in order to evaluate the effectiveness of SBS. Thermal processing, SBS concentration, and time all impacted biological pathogen levels in poultry diets, and including a dry granular acid may be an effective method to reduce pathogen risk. However, the most significant reduction of Enterococcus faecium was due to thermal mitigation. Notably, pelleting reduced Enterococcus faecium by 2 - 3 logs on day 0. In summary, both thermal processing and chemical inclusion can be used to reduce the risk of microbial pathogens in feed...|$|E

The presence of mycotoxins in <b>poultry</b> <b>feeds</b> is <b>a</b> significant factor for financial losses to animal industries. Although DON {{is one of the}} least acutely toxic trichothecenes, it should be treated as an important food safety issue because it is a common contaminant of grains. Special care must be taken in so-called “Fusarium years”. As poultry is regarded to be less sensitive to DON compared to other species it is suspected to divert the infected cereal batches to <b>poultry</b> <b>feeding.</b> This review focuses on the ability of DON to induce toxicologic and immunotoxic effects in chickens. Chickens and laying hens respond to increasing dietary DON concentrations with a reduction in productivity only at high levels above 5 mg/kg but there is no clear evidence of a dose-response relationship. The main effect at low dietary concentrations appears to be a reduction in food consumption (anorexia), while higher doses induce severe reduction in weight and impaired resistance to infection, particularly bacterial infection. One important aspect of DON toxicity is injury to the gastrointestinal tract. DON has an influence intestinal morphology of chickens, especially in the duodenum and jejunum, as evidenced by shorter and thinner villi.

They found that the carotenes of the lespedezas were as well utilized by the chick as those of dehy-drated alfalfa leaf meal. Ringrose and Morgan (1942) also re-ported on the use of lespedeza meals {{as a source of}} riboflavin for chicks. Slightly greater growth rates were obtained with Korean lespedeza meals (sun and shade cured) than with lespedeza sericea and de-hydrated alfalfa leaf meals when thes...|$|R
40|$|Fish meal {{is a high}} quality, but {{expensive}} and scarce, feed ingredient used in fish and <b>poultry</b> <b>feeds.</b> Blood meal, <b>a</b> slaughterhouse by-product, and soybean meal are high quality protein sources successfully used to partially replace fish meal in animal diets; however, the dehydration cost for blood meal makes it as expensive as fish meal. In this study, feed ingredients were developed using soybean meal and pork blood. Whole blood and red blood cells were mixed with soybean meal and processed under different conditions. The methods evaluated were mixing and then drying at temperatures of 50, 70, 90, and 110 °C for 2 h, and mixing and then extrusion with additional blood added during extrusion. When the mixtures were dried at more than 70 °C, their protein digestibility decreased significantly (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). Protein digestibilities decreased as the initial moisture content of extruded mixtures and the extruder barrel temperature increased. All the processing conditions produced microbiologically safe products...|$|R
40|$|Artículos en revistasA LC {{method for}} {{corticosteroids}} (CC) determination in <b>poultry</b> <b>feed</b> using <b>a</b> Chromolith column and UV detection {{has been developed}} and validated. The method development involved the optimization of different hydro-organic mobile phases using methanol or ACN as organic modifiers, flow rate, and temperature. The optimum separation was achieved at 40 degrees C using ACN/water (21 : 79 v/v) as mobile phase and 3 mL/min flow rate, allowing the separation to baseline of four out of seven CC in about 10 min. Prior to LC, a sample preparation procedure previously assayed for anabolics was used. It includes a leaching process, saponification of the esters from fatty acids, and SPE. Method validation was carried out according to the EU criteria established for quantitative screening methods. The extraction efficiencies, decision limits (CCalpha), and detection capabilities (CCbeta) for these compounds were in the ranges of 86 - 92 %, 27 - 36 microg/kg, and 33 - 43 microg/kg, respectively. The repeatability and the within-laboratory reproducibility at 1, 1. 5, and 2 CCbeta concentration levels were smaller than 9. 0, 5. 0, and 4. 2 % and 9. 4, 6. 4, and 4. 9 %, respectively. The CV values of the robustness test were less than 3. 8 % and the accuracy was {{in the range of}} 98 - 103 %. The proposed method was applied to other feed with satisfactory results. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of mycotoxins in <b>poultry</b> <b>feeds</b> is <b>a</b> significant factor for financial losses to animal industries. Ingestion of mycotoxin-contaminated feed by chickens causes {{injury to the}} gastrointestinal tract. DON has negative effects on the active transport of some nutrients in the small intestine of chickens. We tested the hypothesis that prefeeding with probiotic (Eubacterium sp.) or inulin, as a prebiotic, would attenuate these effects. Whereas, there is evidence in chicken that dietary supplementation with probiotic and prebiotic affect the intestinal microflora, increased the paracellular permeability and increased the villus length and villus area of the small intestine. The question of whether these changes affect the toxic effects of DON on the electrogenic glucose transport in the chicken intestine or not needs to be clarified. Therefore, an experiment was conducted to {{study the effects of}} DON in {{the presence or absence of}} dietary (Eubacterium sp.) or inulin on the electrophysiological response of the gut to glucose. The results indicated that in the absence of clinical signs and without impaired performance, DON appeared to alter the gut function of broilers. The addition of Eubacterium sp. may be useful in counteracting the toxic effects of DON on intestinal glucose transport. But, the dietary inulin supplementation of the broilers improved the glucose transport in the {{presence of}} DON and kept it at normal levels...|$|R
