40|$|Abstract In {{specific}} cases, kiln drying {{prior to}} preservative treatment is the prescribed method of utility pole seasoning in South Africa. The slow drying nature of Eucalyptus grandis poles makes rapid kiln drying potentially detrimen-tal due to development of defects such as excessive surface checking, honeycomb and collapse. To control these defects {{while maintaining the}} fastest drying rate possible, the effect of drying schedule on the drying quality of E. grandis poles was investigated. Full length <b>pole</b> <b>drying</b> was simulated in thirty 2. 1 m long butt sections of poles of which the top ends were end sealed. Three industrially used schedules that differed in dry and wet bulb temperature and duration of drying (Tdb, Twb and time) were chosen: 80 °C/ 59 °C/ 8 days, 80 °C/ 69 °C/ 10 days and 70 °C/ 59 °C/ 12 days. Surface check length of each pole was measured after drying. Cross-sections cut at the theoretical ground line (TGL), 1. 5 m from the butt end, were {{used to measure the}} moisture content (MC) gradient between the shell and core of poles. Digital image analysis of cross-sections of discs cut at TGL was used to measure the area of honeycomb and disc cross-section. Collapse was assessed qualitatively. With all three schedules, MC’s in the pole cores at the end of drying were still very high. Some poles were above 25 % in the outer 25 mm of the treatable zone. The 70 °C/ 59 °C/ 12 days schedule generated the highest surface check total length. A reduction in the wet bulb depression o...|$|E
40|$|Evaluation of {{previously}} established field trials of remedial internal treatments demonstrates the continued performance of chioropicrin, Vorlex, and methylisothiocyanate (MITC). While {{the degree of}} protection afforded by these treatments has declined with time, residual fungitoxic levels remain in many tests. Field trials of gelatin encapsulated MITC indicate that gelatin had no negative effect on fumigant performance even when no water was added {{at the time of}} treatment. Closed tube bioassays, chemical analyses, and culturing of Douglas-fir and southern pine poles treated with glass encapsulated METC (MITC-Fume) indicate that this chemical is outperforming metham sodium 3 years after application. While the glass vials lost chemical very slowly, the slow release rate did not appear to adversely affect MITC performance. Trials to evaluate the performance of fused borate rods were sampled after 1 or 2 years of exposure. Chemical analysis of cores removed from the test poles revealed that none of the treatments contained boron at levels which would be considered adequate for arresting or preventing colonization by wood decay fungi. Interestingly, boron levels in poles exposed in Hilo, Hawaii were highest above the treatment hole, suggesting that some upward diffusion of this chemical is possible. The low boron levels in these poles are reason for concern, since a number of utilities are considering the using this formulation for remedial treatment at the groundline. Evaluations of new solid fumigants are progressing. Trials with Basamid indicate that the addition of copper compounds improved the rate of decomposition to produce MITC. Simultaneous addition of copper sulfate and Basamid may be useful for accelerating the decomposition of this compound, making it practical for control of internal decay fungi. Trials have been established to evaluate the performance of gelled and pelletized metham sodium and a sodium fluoride/boron rod. These trials will be evaluated in future reports. A third field trial to evaluate the performance of a copper naphthenate/boron paste for internal treatment of Douglas-fir poles is currently be evaluated to determine chemical levels 3 years after treatment. The performance of gelled metham sodium was further evaluated under laboratory conditions to better understand the performance of this chemical. Gelled metham sodium provided improved fungal control in comparison with liquid metham sodium and appeared to produce increased MITC levels under a variety of test conditions. The improved performance of this formulation may reflect the ability of the gell to retain moisture {{for longer periods of time}} than the liquid metham sodium formulation. Further studies of this formulation are underway. Laboratory studies were also performed to evaluate the effects of various additives on the performance of Basamid. Once again, the addition of copper compounds enhanced the production of MITC. A number of other compounds shifted decomposition to the production of carbon disulfide and carbonyl sulfide, two less fungitoxic compounds. Further studies are underway to identify non-sulfur products which may provide some protection against wood decay fungi. Evaluations of the effects of artificial voids on performance of fumigants in Douglas-fir poles indicate that voids had little or no effect on fumigant distribution. As a result, fumigant treatment of solid wood around voids represents a viable strategy for improving pole service life. Evaluation of timbers treated with metham sodium indicate that detectable levels of MITC were present one year after treatment. These timbers will be evaluated in subsequent years to determine the protective period provided by fumigants in sawn material. We continue development of a fumigant movement model using data previously developed on MITC. This year, we evaluated a previously developed system, ANSYS. Results of preliminary trials are similar to data previously developed on MITC-Fume treated poles and indicate that modeling MITC movement should be possible. Further trials are underway to confirm and expand this model. The effect of wood moisture content, temperature and wood species on metham sodium decomposition was investigated under laboratory conditions. The efficiency of dcomposition to MITC varied widely, but was most affected by temperature and wood moisture content. The results suggests that there is considerable potential for improving decomposition efficiency to enhance performance of this fumigant. Further studies to characterize the relationship between chemical content of the wood species and decomposition are underway. Field trials to identify safer treatments for preventing decay of cedar sapwood and protecting field drilled bolt holes are continuing. Diffusible treatments continue to provide excellent protection for field drilled bolt holes. A study to develop estimates of the extent of decay above the groundline in Douglas-fir poles in the Pacific Northwest is underway. The data from this study will be used to develop estimates of the potential for damage and provide some insight into the extent of this problem. Studies to develop guidelines for sterilization of Douglas-fir poles following air-seasoning are continuing. Evaluations of internal temperature development during kiln-drying were completed this year and indicate that internal temperatures during typical <b>pole</b> <b>drying</b> schedules were more than adequate for acheiving sterilization. Further evaluations of the data are underway to develop reliable heating curves for this process. Evaluations of groundline preservative systems have been established at Corvallis, OR and Merced, CA. The results indicate that all of the formulations are moving well through the wood in a manner similar to that found with pentachlorophenol-based systems. Chemical levels in some treatments; however, are beginning to decline 30 months after treatment. Studies are now underway to establish thresholds for combinations of the various formulations. Copper naphthenate treated western redcedar stakelets continue to perform well in fungus cellar trials. Stakes weathered prior to treatment are degrading slightly faster, while freshly sawn stakelets continue to perform well. Field trials have also been established to evaluate the performance of copper naphthenate treated Douglas-fir utility poles in California and Oregon. The chemical levels and fungal colonization will be monitored in these poles to provide a guide to performance of this chemical in western wood species...|$|E

One end of each he sharpened, and drove in between the interstices of the stone, at a distance of some two feet and a half apart and four feet from the ground.

40|$|Recently a {{maintenance}} worker in Sweden {{was killed when}} climbing into a wood pole supporting an 11 -kV overhead line. The investigating done afterwards raised the suspicion that a current flowed through the pole was sufficient to kill a person. Due to a broken insulator one of the phases of the 11 -kV line had been resting on the metal crossbar. This accident triggered an investigation {{in order to determine}} if power line wood poles can conduct current and if so, whether this current can be sufficient to injure {{a maintenance}} worker climbing into the pole. The study has been made at the 11 kV level on a pole while a live wire was resting on the metal cross arm as would be the case if the insulator had broken. A proposal for a measuring method has been developed in order to determine under what conditions climbing should be prohibited. In Sweden the use of wood poles as part of 11 kV overhead lines is fairly common. A three phase system is used to distribute 11 kV, one wire for each phase, and the three wires are supported by insulators mounted on a horizontal metal (or wood) cross arm. The poles are treated with some kind of preservative to protect the wood from rot and insects. Three kinds of preservatives are commonly used in Sweden: arsenic, creosote and salt. In this study eight poles with different preservative and age varying from 50 years old to brand new have been examined in a realistic environment. The measurements presented in this paper support the earlier suspicion that a wood pole used for distributing power can conduct current if a fault occurs and a live wire comes in contact with the metal cross arm. It also shows that the current through a parallel, not connected to earth, resistor (i. e. a human climbing the pole) can reach potentially harmful amplitudes. Three main variables that affect the electrical characteristics of the pole have been identified: the preservation of the wood; the environmental temperature; and the humidity of the surroundings.

50|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, {{a significant}} {{fraction of the}} light shining {{on the surface of}} the water is lost by reflection and, thus, will not be available to attract fish and members of their food chain. Security lights can be modified to operate submerged in water. Positioning the bulb underwater delivers approximately twice as much light to attract fish. However, the modification must be done professionally as the high voltages that power these lamps can be lethal. Commercially made, submersible fishing lights are available on the internet.

Floating like a fishing line bob, the lamp is positioned underwater by weights on its submerged power supply cord. The bulb is fragile so some manufacturers offer protective covers and hard lenses. However, one unique feature of the submerged, unprotected bulb is that its outer glass envelope gets hot enough to prevent establishment of marine growth. When the bulb has a protective cover or is not operated daily occasional cleaning is required. A permanently fixed fishing light attractor is most effective if it is operated every night. It takes to a week or two for larger fish to discover the increasing concentration of bait fish attracted to the light.

40|$|Surprisingly {{little of}} Yeatsian {{scholarship}} {{deals with the}} cluster of images that forms {{one of the basic}} building blocks of the poet's philosophical system, water and its related imagery. This thesis intends to remedy this neglect. The centrality of water imagery {{stems from the fact that}} Yeats had identified both himself and the Irish people (his subject, as he was trying to build a national body of symbols) with water. Water [...] sea, lake, ice, well [...] and its related imagery [...] moon, water birds, fish and dolphins, blood and alcohol as related liquids [...] pervades the poetical and dramatical work of Yeats. Water imagery is one half of the system that provided Yeats with his subjects, a religion of opposites; the other half is absence of water or fire. Water and fire, wet and dry, the Moon and the Sun symbolize Yeatsian opposites that either unite (Unity of Being) or clash (opposite characters or ages). In the late works, when Yeats concentrates on the Great Wheel, water and fire are fixed as a key concept of the gyre, its poles. All the images that had been paired with or related to water or the absence of water in the earlier works (stone, garden, tree, bird, woman) converge as correspondences for the two poles, each feeding off the other (the clashing opposites are alternate aspects of the one reality that is the gyre).

This study is related to a Norwegian plant where such poles are produced using Scots pine. Prior to the preservation process the poles have to be dried to a moisture content below the fibre saturation point everywhere in the pole. This is done outdoors in open stacks of poles, i. e. as air-drying. A problem {{is caused by the}} difficulties to determine when the target moisture content has been reached. The inventory of <b>drying</b> <b>poles</b> represents considerable value in a company's balance sheet and risk of downgrading. Knowledge of drying times during the annual seasons has been insufficient, and no efficient method is known for accurately observing the MC through the various parts of the poles. Thus, there is risk both for keeping higher inventory than optimal and for treating poles that would not be dried sufficiently. It was thus investigated whether a simulation model could be used for this determination. Climate data- temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and rain- as daily averages from a national weather station in the same area is used for defining the drying conditions. The moisture migration within the poles is described as a diffusion process, taking into account that the cross section contains both sapwood and heartwood with quite different properties. Diffusion coefficient values are selected based on experience from sawn timber simulation models. The main issue is to determine the interaction between poles and the surrounding weather. Poles in a small stack were individually weighed several times during a half-year period and the drying rate thus determined. These experimental results were used for tuning of the model. Problems encountered in this tuning process are discussed...|$|R
60|$|We {{have another}} market in our French watering-place - {{that is to}} say, a few wooden hutches in the open street, down by the Port - devoted to fish. Our fishing-boats are famous everywhere; and our fishing people, though they love lively colours, and taste is neutral (see Bilkins), {{are among the most}} picturesque people we ever encountered. They have not only a quarter of their own in the town itself, but they occupy whole villages of their own on the {{neighbouring}} cliffs. Their churches and chapels are their own; they consort with one another, they intermarry among themselves, their customs are their own, and their costume is their own and never changes. As soon as one of their boys can walk, he is provided with a long bright red nightcap; and one of their men would as soon think of going afloat without his head, as without that indispensable appendage to it. Then, they wear the noblest boots, with the hugest tops - flapping and bulging over anyhow; above which, they encase themselves in such wonderful overalls and petticoat trousers, made to all appearance of tarry old sails, so additionally stiffened with pitch and salt, that the wearers have a walk of their own, and go straddling and swinging about among the boats and barrels and nets and rigging, a sight to see. Then, their younger women, by dint of going down to the sea barefoot, to fling their baskets into the boats as they come in with the tide, and bespeak the first fruits of the haul with propitiatory promises to love and marry that dear fisherman who shall fill that basket like an Angel, have the finest legs ever carved by Nature in the brightest mahogany, and they walk like Juno. Their eyes, too, are so lustrous that their long gold ear-rings turn dull beside those brilliant neighbours; and when they are dressed, what with these beauties, and their fine fresh faces, and their many petticoats - striped petticoats, red petticoats, blue petticoats, always clean and smart, and never too long - and their home-made stockings, mulberry-coloured, blue, brown, purple, lilac - which the older women, taking care of the Dutch-looking children, sit in all sorts of places knitting, knitting, knitting from morning to night - and what with their little saucy bright blue jackets, knitted too, and fitting close to their handsome figures; and what with the natural grace with which they wear the commonest cap, or fold the commonest handkerchief round their luxuriant hair - we say, in a word and out of breath, that taking all these premises into our consideration, it has never been a matter of the least surprise to us that we have never once met, in the cornfields, on the dusty roads, by the breezy windmills, on the plots of short sweet grass overhanging the sea - anywhere - a young fisherman and fisherwoman of our French watering-place together, but the arm of that fisherman has invariably been, {{as a matter of course}} and without any absurd attempt to disguise so plain a necessity, round the neck or waist of that fisherwoman. And we have had no doubt whatever, standing looking at their uphill streets, house rising above house, and terrace above terrace, and bright garments here and there lying sunning on rough stone parapets, that the pleasant mist on all such objects, caused by their being seen through the brown nets hung across on <b>poles</b> to <b>dry,</b> is, in the eyes of every true young fisherman, a mist of love and beauty, setting off the goddess of his heart.|$|R
40|$|Evaluation of {{previously}} established field trials of internal remedial treatments continues {{to verify the}} excellent long-term protection afforded by these treatments. Field trials with gell encapsulated methylisothiocyanate (MITC) demonstrate that gelatin does not interfere with chemical release, nor is addition of supplemental moisture required for release. Field trials have been established to evaluate several new formulations including Basamid plus copper, boron/fluoride rods, and boron rods. Field trials of gelled and pelletized metham sodium indicate that both formulations are moving well through Douglas-fir poles one year after treatment. Evaluations of a copper naphthenate/boron paste for internal treatment indicate that the formulation has moved {{a short distance from}} the point of application 3 years after treatment. Boron rod field trials were not fully sampled for residual chemical level this past year; however, evaluation of cores removed from fused borate rod trials in New York indicate that some additional boron diffusion has occurred. Examination of treatment holes suggests that considerable amounts of the boron remain in rod form 2 years after application. In laboratory studies, we have evaluated the use of metham sodium/basamid mixtures and have found that these formulations provide enhanced MITC production over longer periods than either of the components alone. Both formulations were solid, creating the potential for development of safer formulations which provide a rapid release with long term protection. Field trials of these systems will be established in the coming months. Studies also continue with Basamid in an effort to enhance decomposition of this compound. Studies have shown that moisture addition has the most significant effect on decomposition followed by the presence of copper and increasing pH. Further studies on decomposition products are planned to better understand the activity of this molecule. Examination of Douglas-fir timbers treated with metham sodium indicate that MITC levels are similar to those found in poles at similar times after treatment. The presence increased surface area on timbers apparently did not adversely affect diffusion or chemical loss. Evaluation of the fungitoxicity of mixtures of MITC and carbon disulfide is underway in an effort better understand the activity of metham sodium. This compound decomposes to produce a wide array of volatile compounds with varying degrees of toxicity to fungi. Preliminary trials have shown the relatively low toxicity associated with carbon disulfide, a major decomposition product, particularly under acidic conditions. Trials with mixtures will begin shortly. Efforts to develop a three dimensional model of MITC movement are continuing. The model has been evaluated on data collected from small blocks and efforts are underway to verify these results. In addition, full pole grids have been prepared to evaluate the effects of treatment hole geometry and orientation on fumigant movement. Studies to identify alternative treatments for protecting western redcedar sapwood from decay are continuing. A variety chemicals {{have been shown to be}} effective 5 years after treatment; however, longer term trials of other formulations suggests that performance declines rapidly at longer time points. Field trials of remedial treatments for field drilled bolt holes continue to demonstrate the performance of diffusible boron and fluoride for preventing fungal attack. These trials will be evaluated again in the coming year. Inspection of the above ground region of Douglas-fir poles in the Pacific Northwest have shown that many poles are colonized by decay fungi far above the groundline. Fungal incidence was greatest in poles near the coast, but decay fungi were also isolated from <b>poles</b> in <b>drier</b> climates. Sampling of additional poles is planned to provide a more detailed analysis of the risk of above ground decay in this region. Efforts are also continuing to evaluate the performance of through-bored Douglas-fir poles to provide better data on the degree of preservative penetration required in the through-bored zone to achieve optimum performance. These trials have shown that most poles are well treated, but no decay has been detected in the through bored zone of poles with as little as 60...|$|R
5000|$|Vettel was {{involved}} in a minor tangle with Sergio Pérez during practice for the , damaging his front wing coming out of the pits. Vettel claimed the impact happened because of a brake issue that failed to slow the car down saying 'something broke on the front right' on the team radio. In spite of his claims, the incident was investigated by the race stewards. Both Vettel and Pérez were cleared of any wrongdoing later that evening, and so escaped any penalties. The rest of the weekend was mixed for Vettel, who qualified on the front row, but had several issues and off-track escapades during the race before being stuck behind Valtteri Bottas' Williams and having to settle for fifth. Given that he had qualified on the front row and that teammate Räikkönen was second, the result was somewhat underwhelming, and he dropped to third place in the championship as a result. Vettel commented that he lost his rhythm during the race and did not have enough confidence in the rear end of the car, but nevertheless remained positive about the performance potential of the car. Before his front wing damage, Vettel had twice overtaken Nico Rosberg for second place during pit stops, only to immediately be pegged back. Vettel was in second for a long spell during the [...] but due to a change of pit stop strategy, Lewis Hamilton got past and pulled away, leaving Vettel in third {{at the end of the}} race. He finished second in Monaco, having run very close to eventual winner Rosberg for most parts of the race. Mercedes made a strategic error in bringing dominant leader Hamilton in for new tyres at the late safety car, placing him right behind Vettel. The duel that followed made Vettel fall back from Rosberg, but he managed to hold off Hamilton to finish an unlikely second. In Canada, Vettel got his lowest qualifying position of the season, qualifying in 18th, and then received a five place grid penalty for overtaking under red flags in practice 3 that morning. The race, however, was a success, as he finished 5th behind teammate Räikkönen.Following a 4th in Austria and 3rd at Silverstone that appeared to edge Vettel further away from a title challenge, he rebounded with a commanding win in the , after a superb start from 3rd on the grid, which saw him slice past both Mercedes cars and retain the lead throughout. The win was Vettel's first ever at the Hungaroring and equalled Ayrton Senna's total of 41 Formula One victories. It was dedicated to Jules Bianchi who died the week prior from injuries sustained in 2014. At the halfway point of the season, Vettel was 42 points behind championship leader Hamilton, and said the team aimed to make what was seen as 'impossible' possible during the second half of the season. He however accepted a lot of work was needed to be done to catch up. Vettel looked set for third in Belgium after a long stint on the supposedly conservative medium tyre when his right rear blew at high speed on the penultimate lap, likely ending any title chances given Hamilton won. After the race he went on a furious rant about control tyre manufacturer Pirelli and the 'unacceptable' and 'unsafe' tyres that could have caused him serious injury had the explosion occurred in the Eau Rouge corner just before where it actually occurred and since it was the second such blowout at high speed during the weekend (the first befell Nico Rosberg during practice). Vettel was also unhappy with Pirelli's suggestion that the failures were due to the drivers going wide picking up debris, saying he never did.Vettel came home second in the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, the first race for him with Ferrari at the team's home soil. Amid a contract dispute regarding the venue's future Vettel once again went on the rampage and said that the race could not be lost and would 'rip the heart out of Formula One' if it did. He also stated that he regarded his first podium for Ferrari at Monza as 'the best second place of his life'. Vettel then took his first Ferrari pole at the Singapore Grand Prix. It was the team's first pole for three years, and first <b>dry</b> <b>pole</b> since at the same venue five years earlier. Vettel was 0.543 seconds ahead of Daniel Ricciardo in second. He went on to win the race from Ricciardo, thus surpassing Ayrton Senna's victory count for his 42nd career win, moving him into third on the all-time list. With championship leader Hamilton retiring, Vettel closed to within 49 points with seven races remaining. The title challenge once again diminished in the next race in Japan. Vettel did however score his tenth podium finish of the year, finishing third behind Hamilton and Rosberg at a track with significantly different attributes to Singapore. Vettel scored another second place and with fastest lap of race at Sochi moving him to second place in Drivers' Championship following Nico Rosberg's retirement in the early parts of the race. In the United States Vettel started from 13th due to an engine change penalty, but still charged his way to a podium, even challenging Rosberg for second on the final lap.|$|R
