40|$|AbstractA {{critical}} {{characteristic of}} most WECs (wave energy converters) {{is the large}} peak-to-average power ratio. This poses many challenges {{to the design of}} high-efficient PTO (<b>power</b> <b>take-off)</b> <b>systems</b> and, even more importantly, to integrate this form of renewable energy into power grids. The OWC (oscillating water column) WECs are devices whose PTO uses an air turbine as the primary energy converter. Besides its inherent simplicity, probably the greatest advantage of OWC based WECs is the ability to control or dissipate any excess of energy available to the PTO system that may occur in medium to highly energetic sea states. The contribution of the paper is the performance assessment of a new control algorithm to operate a HSSV (high-speed stop valve) installed in series with the turbine. The goal is to perform close-to-optimal latching control of the WEC and, simultaneously, operate the HSSV to limit the energy available to the turbine/generator set. The proposed control algorithm shows large improvements in the extracted mean power while limiting the peak-to-average power ratio, thus improving the power quality delivered to the electrical grid. Tests performed in a large-scale PTO test rig validated the algorithm...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Wave energy {{conversion}} {{is still in}} its infancy, and in order for it to become a commercially viable technology, developers, investors and utilities need to estimate a Wave Energy Converter's (WEC's) performance for the wave climate of a potential installation site. With the goal of estimating a design's power output when subject to stochastic ocean waves, a time-domain modeling methodology was developed for point absorber WECs with arbitrary device geometry. This methodology uses the geometry's unique frequency-domain hydrodynamic response to determine the point absorber's time-domain impulse response functions. By implementing the point absorber's impulse response functions, time-domain equations of motion are defined and the WEC's heave displacement and velocity are solved for in a WEC Dynamics Model developed in MATLAB/Simulink. The modeling methodology is first validated for a single-body point absorber with complex geometry by comparison with experimental data. Then the methodology is applied to a two-body point absorber geometry that is representative of designs currently being pursued. The time-domain point absorber model is extended to include a hydraulic <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> <b>system</b> model that estimates the wave energy converter's power output when subject to real ocean waves.

However, the limited applications and techniques of ocean wave energy conversion have been reported. In this thesis, recently published researches for electromagnetic {{vibration energy}} harvesting techniques have been studied. The various techniques are classified in terms of micro and macro vibration energy harvesters, broad bandwidth vibration energy harvesters, and large scale ocean wave energy converters. The review of the nonlinear oscillator vibration energy harvester based on magnetic spring is focused. The efficiency of extracting energy from the waves is limited, although various concepts and designs of the <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> <b>systems</b> and primary interface and circuits have been studied. This thesis will identify the possible <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> <b>systems</b> from reviewing electromagnetic vibration energy harvesting techniques aiming to increase the power and bandwidth of ocean wave energy converter for maximizing future utilization of the ocean wave energy. This thesis invents a cuboid generator with high vibration energy harvesting performance. The cuboid vibration energy harvester consists of a fixed pulley mechanism connecting two magnet array units with a coil unit on the two sides of the pulleys. The two magnet array units are arranged in double Halbach magnet arrays which are used to increase the magnetic field intensity and flux intensity change rate around the coils. The fixed pulley mechanism is used to double the speed of the magnets with respect to the coil unit. As the output voltage of the vibration energy harvester is proportional to the magnetic field intensity and flux intensity change rate around the coils and the speed of the magnets with respect to the coils. The novel design of the prismatic tube vibration energy harvester has a high vibration or wave energy harvesting performance or capacity. This thesis investigates the cuboid generator functioning as vibration energy harvester or wave energy converter through linear and nonlinear oscillator dynamic analyses in a low frequency range. Duffing type nonlinear oscillator dynamic differential equation is developed for the nonlinear analysis where the effect of the rotational inertia of the pulleys on the oscillator mass is considered, which is different from the literatures. The nonlinear oscillator dynamic differential equation is solved by using the harmonic balance method and perturbation method in order to widen energy harvesting frequency bandwidth. The formula of the dimensionless harvested power of the nonlinear oscillator mass-spring-damper system is derived and a parameter study is conducted for the design optimisation of the harvester. The parameters that affect the nonlinearity of the oscillator are also studied in this thesis. Finally, the prototype of the novel device is built and tested to validate the analysis. The influence of nonlinear oscillator interaction force acting on the moving part on the generator&rsquo;s potential well is also studied in this thesis.
