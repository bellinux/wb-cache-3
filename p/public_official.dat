5|$|The legal {{elements}} and {{features of the}} major federal public corruption offenses differ. The various jurisdictional elements of the offenses require that the prosecution prove, alternatively: that the payee was a federal official; that the payee organization received $10,000 in federal funds; that the corrupt communications involved {{the use of the}} mail or interstate wires; that the corruption affected interstate commerce or interstate travel. The mens rea elements differ in whether they require a quid pro quo; a mere nexus is an easier element to prove; more difficult elements to prove include the intent to be influenced and inducement. The offenses also differ in whether the act to be procured from the <b>public</b> <b>official</b> must be an official, a violation of an official duty, a fraud on the United States, or an official transaction. The offenses also differ in whether the payor may be prosecuted in addition to the <b>public</b> <b>official.</b> Finally, the offenses differ in whether they are predicates for Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and money laundering prosecutions, and in the maximum authorized prison sentence that may be imposed upon conviction.|$|E

5|$|According to Armando Maya Castro, many {{students}} {{who are members of}} the church have been discriminated against for refusing to partake in celebrations and customs concerning the Day of the Dead in their schools, and some have been punished for it. In one case reported by a Mexican newspaper, La Gaceta, a female member of the church was pushed by a fellow bus passenger, who then crossed herself because the member was wearing a long skirt. In July 25, 2008, a <b>public</b> <b>official</b> sealed the entrance to a La Luz del Mundo temple in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, trapping the congregation inside until other officials removed the seals. This incident occurred because of complaints from individuals who did not like the presence of the church in the area.

Thơ agreed to meet Ba Cụt alone in the jungle, and despite fears that the meeting was a Hòa Hảo trap, he was not ambushed. However, Ba Cụt began asking for additional concessions and the meeting ended in a stalemate. According to historian Hue-Tam Ho Tai, Ba Cụt's lifelong antipathy towards Thơ's family influenced his behaviour during his last stand. Ba Cụt was arrested by a patrol on 13 April 1956, and his remaining forces were defeated in battle.|$|E
50|$|A common {{explanation}} of the flypaper effect has {{a focus on the}} role of <b>public</b> <b>officials.</b> It was first argued by Niskanen that <b>public</b> <b>officials</b> tend to maximize their budgets by the budget-maximizing model. As <b>public</b> <b>officials</b> are budget maximizers, the bureaucrats have no incentive to inform citizens about the true level of grant funding that a community receives. If <b>public</b> <b>officials</b> conceal this information, they may trick citizens into voting for a higher level of funding than would have otherwise been the case. In this respect, the flypaper effect occurs because citizens are unaware of the true budget constraint.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{several hundred}} {{cases in which}} citizens were contacted in an 'informal' way by <b>public</b> <b>officials</b> {{as part of the}} Dutch Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations' Fair Tracks project. In Fair Tracks, <b>public</b> <b>officials</b> engage in direct and interpersonal conversations with citizens when the officials are about to make a negative decision or upon receiving citizens' complaints or objections against government decisions. <b>Public</b> <b>officials</b> typically do so by phone and the purpose of the open communication that follows is to discuss together what the problem is and how the citizen's problem can best be handled. The current paper presents empirical evidence suggesting that why Fair Tracks works is because it activates perceived procedural justice. For example, when citizens felt they had been treated respectfully and politely by <b>public</b> <b>officials</b> and when they could voice their opinions to the <b>public</b> <b>officials</b> this led to a reliable perception of procedural justice. Furthermore, higher levels of perceived procedural justice were associated with more satisfaction about the outcome reached during the conversation with the <b>public</b> <b>officials,</b> more trust in mutual compliance with the outcome, more trust in government, and higher levels of conflict resolution. Implications and limitations are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{proposed}} a link between corruption and wages in the public sector. The present paper investigates this link using a laboratory experiment. In the experiment, <b>public</b> <b>officials</b> {{have the opportunity to}} accept a bribe and can then decide between a neutral and a corrupt action. The corrupt action benefits the briber but poses a large negative externality on a charity. The results show that increasing public officials' wages greatly reduces their corruptibility. In particular, low-wage <b>public</b> <b>officials</b> accept 91 % of bribes on average, whereas high-wage <b>public</b> <b>officials</b> accept 38 %. Moreover, high-wage <b>public</b> <b>officials</b> are less likely to choose the corrupt option. Additionally, the results suggest that a positive monitoring rate may be necessary for these effects to arise. (author's abstract...|$|R
