5|$|The {{prominent}} New South Wales parliamentarian Sir Terence Aubrey Murray (1810–1873) purchased Yarralumla in 1837. He {{lived there}} with his wife Mary Murray (née Gibbes, 1817–1858), the second daughter of the Collector of Customs for NSW, Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787–1873), MLC. In 1859, Murray sold Yarralumla to his brother-in-law, Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes (1828–1897).

5|$|Lynch, {{the fourth}} of six children, was born March 31, 1955, in the {{neighborhood}} of South Boston. He was raised with his five sisters in the Old Colony Housing Project. His father, Francis Lynch, was an ironworker who had dropped out of school in the eighth grade. His mother, Anne (née Havlin), was a night-shift post office worker. Both <b>parents</b> <b>came</b> from fourth-generation South Boston families. He attended St. Augustine Elementary School and South Boston High School. During high school vacations he began working in construction alongside his father. After graduating from high school in 1973, Lynch became an apprentice ironworker. For the next six years he worked on high-altitude structural ironwork throughout the United States for various companies, including General Motors and U.S. Steel.|$|E
5|$|George II's {{relationship}} with his son and heir apparent, Frederick, Prince of Wales, worsened during the 1730s. Frederick {{had been left behind}} in Germany when his <b>parents</b> <b>came</b> to England, and they had not met for 14 years. In 1728, he was brought to England, and swiftly became a figurehead of the political opposition. When George visited Hanover in the summers of 1729, 1732 and 1735, he left his wife to chair the regency council in Britain rather than his son. Meanwhile, rivalry between George II and his brother-in-law and first cousin Frederick William I of Prussia led to tension along the Prussian–Hanoverian border, which eventually culminated in the mobilization of troops in the border zone and suggestions of a duel between the two kings. Negotiations for a marriage between the Prince of Wales and Frederick William's daughter Wilhelmine dragged on for years but neither side would make the concessions demanded by the other, and the idea was shelved. Instead, the prince married Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha in April 1736.|$|E

The Cornells had four children: Joseph, Elizabeth (b. 1905), Helen (b. 1906), and Robert (b. 1910). Both <b>parents</b> <b>came</b> from socially prominent families of Dutch ancestry, long-established in New York State. Cornell's father died in 1917, leaving the family in strained circumstances. Following the elder Cornell's death, {{his wife and children}} moved to the borough of Queens in New York City.

25|$|When Phase 3 {{registrations}} {{started on}} 30 August, {{there were still}} 6,000 available places across all primary schools in Singapore. Principals had advised parents against homing in on certain schools since all schools provide quality education. In spite of this, camping tents were set up at Tanjong Katong Primary School, maids were asked to queue, and <b>parents</b> <b>came</b> prepared with packets of food and blankets. On 29 August, MOE had informed the parents that the school had only one place left, and that place {{would go to the}} first person in the queue as balloting would not be carried out unlike in the earlier phases.

25|$|During her imprisonment, Maria Luisa and her {{children}} were stripped of their rights to the Spanish crown by the Cádiz Cortes, on 18 March 1812, because she was under Napoleon's control. Her rights were not restored until 1820. The former Queen of Etruria wrote in her Memoirs:I was {{for two years and}} a half in that monastery and one year without seeing or talking to anybody. I was not allowed to write or receive news not even from my own son. I had been in the convent for eleven months already when my <b>parents</b> <b>came</b> with my son to Rome on 16 June 1812. I was hoping to be released immediately after their arrival, but I was wrong, instead of diminishing the rigor of my imprisonment I was put under stricter orders.|$|E
25|$|Born Henry Saint Clair Fredericks, Jr. on May 17, 1942, in Harlem, New York, Mahal {{grew up in}} Springfield, Massachusetts. Raised in {{a musical}} environment, {{his mother was a}} member of a local gospel choir and his father was an Afro-Caribbean jazz {{arranger}} and piano player. His family owned a shortwave radio which received music broadcasts from around the world, exposing him at an early age to world music. Early in childhood he recognized the stark differences between the popular music of his day and the music that was played in his home. He also became interested in jazz, enjoying the works of musicians such as Charles Mingus, Thelonious Monk and Milt Jackson. His <b>parents</b> <b>came</b> of age during the Harlem Renaissance, instilling in their son a sense of pride in his Caribbean and African ancestry through their stories.|$|E
25|$|Luther Standing Bear {{left the}} Pine Ridge Reservation to attend Carlisle. His father celebrated his son's brave act by {{inviting}} {{his friends to}} a gathering and gave away seven horses and all the goods in his dry goods store. Luther became a school recruiter for Captain Pratt and periodically visited reservations. He demonstrated what the students had learned and persuaded parents {{to send their children}} to Carlisle by his appearance, language and skills; however, many children died from infectious diseases in boarding schools and parents were fearful to let them go. Moreover, many parents were treated unfairly and had not been notified until after the children died and were buried. Unscrupulous Indian agents failed to mail letters from Carlisle to the parents, until the <b>parents</b> <b>came</b> into the agency for something. While many parents were proud of Luther, they were afraid to send their children away fearing they would never see them again.|$|E

500|$|Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta {{was born}} on March 28, 1986, in Manhattan, New York at the Lenox Hill Hospital to a Catholic family with Italian and French Canadian roots. Her parents are Cynthia Louise (née Bissett) and {{internet}} entrepreneur Joseph Germanotta, {{and she has a}} younger sister, Natali. Brought up in the affluent Upper West Side of Manhattan, she says that her <b>parents</b> <b>came</b> from lower-class families and worked hard for everything. From age 11, she attended the Convent of the Sacred Heart, a private, all-girls Roman Catholic school. Gaga described her academic life in high school as [...] "very dedicated, very studious, very disciplined" [...] but also [...] "a bit insecure". She considered herself a misfit among her peers and was mocked for [...] "being either too provocative or too eccentric".|$|E
500|$|L.D. Cooper, {{a leather}} worker and Korean War veteran, was {{proposed}} {{as a suspect}} in July 2011 by his niece, Marla Cooper. As an eight-year-old, she recalled Cooper and another uncle planning something [...] "very mischievous", involving the use of [...] "expensive walkie-talkies", at her grandmother's house in Sisters, Oregon, [...] south of Portland. The next day flight 305 was hijacked; and though the uncles ostensibly were turkey hunting, L.D. Cooper came home wearing a bloody shirt—the result, he said, of an auto accident. Later, she said, her <b>parents</b> <b>came</b> to believe that L.D. Cooper was the hijacker. She also recalled that her uncle, who died in 1999, was obsessed with the Canadian comic book hero Dan Cooper (see Theories and conjectures), and [...] "had one of his comic books thumbtacked to his wall"—although {{he was not a}} skydiver or paratrooper.|$|E
500|$|Some {{children}} {{were trained in}} skills valuable to the area. [...] In Shrewsbury, the boys {{were placed in the}} workhouse's workshop, while girls were tasked with spinning, making gloves and other jobs [...] "suited to their sex, their ages and abilities". [...] At St Martin in the Fields, {{children were}} trained in spinning flax, picking hair and carding wool, before being placed as apprentices. [...] Workhouses also had links with local industry; in Nottingham, children employed in a cotton mill earned about £60 a year for the workhouse. [...] Some parishes advertised for apprenticeships, and were willing to pay any employer prepared to offer them. [...] Such agreements were preferable to supporting children in the workhouse: apprenticed children were not subject to inspection by justices, thereby lowering the chance of punishment for neglect; and apprenticeships were viewed as a better long-term method of teaching skills to children who might otherwise be uninterested in work. [...] Supporting an apprenticed child was also considerably cheaper than the workhouse or outdoor relief. [...] Children often had no say in the matter, which could be arranged without the permission or knowledge of their parents. [...] The supply of labour from workhouse to factory, which remained popular until the 1830s, was sometimes viewed as a form of transportation. [...] While getting parish apprentices from Clerkenwell, Samuel Oldknow's agent reported how some <b>parents</b> <b>came</b> [...] "crying to beg they may have their Children out again". [...] Historian Arthur Redford suggests that the poor may have once shunned factories as [...] "an insidious sort of workhouse".|$|E
