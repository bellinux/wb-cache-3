50|$|The {{challenge}} and threat hypothesis states that people perform worse on complex tasks and better on simple tasks {{when in the}} <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>others</b> because <b>of</b> the type of cardio-vascular response to the task.

40|$|People {{are less}} likely to help when they have been ostracized, or when they are in the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> bystanders. In the current {{manuscript}} we test both these influences simultaneously. We postulated two opposing hypotheses: first, helping decreases after ostracism, even when intervention is already less likely due to bystander presence. Second, the bystander effect could be reversed, as helping may benefit oneâ€™s reputation, especially in the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>others.</b> After playing Cyberball to manipulate ostracism, participants could help others on either a crowded or empty internet forum. In support of the first hypothesis, we found two main effects: replicating the bystander effect, the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>others</b> diminished helping. Moreover, ostracism diminished helping, even in the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>others...</b>|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>others</b> facilitates or inhibits an individual's performance. To investigate the neural bases of the effect <b>of</b> the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>others,</b> using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), we measured bilateral prefrontal activation (BA 10) in humans while they performed a simulated driving task. Participants were divided into four groups according to the combination <b>of</b> the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>others</b> (Single vs. Paired) and the game experience (High vs. Low) : S-H, S-L, P-H, and P-L groups. The participant's task was to drive from start to goal using a route map either driving alone without a paired partner (single condition) or driving with a paired partner as an observer (paired condition). The results revealed that the single groups (S-H, S-L) yielded more errors than the paired groups (P-H, P-L) regardless of the game experience. However, the NIRS data demonstrated an interaction between the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>others</b> (S, P) and the game experience (H, L) : The P-H showed higher brain activity than the S-H, whereas the P-L showed lower brain activity than the S-L. These results suggest that the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>others</b> functions distinctively in the prefrontal cortex in participants according to their prior experience in the relevant task...|$|R

5|$|Although sauropods {{may have}} been the prey of choice for Majungasaurus, discoveries {{published}} in 2007 detail finds in Madagascar that indicate the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> Majungasaurus in their diet. Numerous bones of Majungasaurus have been discovered bearing tooth marks identical to those found on sauropod bones from the same localities. These marks have the same spacing as teeth in Majungasaurus jaws, are of the same size as Majungasaurus teeth, and contain smaller notches consistent with the serrations on those teeth. As Majungasaurus is the only large theropod known from the area, the simplest explanation is that it was feeding on other members of its own species. Suggestions that the Triassic Coelophysis was a cannibal have been recently disproven, leaving Majungasaurus as the only non-avian theropod with confirmed cannibalistic tendencies, although {{there is some evidence that}} cannibalism may have occurred in other species as well.|$|E

5|$|Captain Scarlet becomes Spectrum's {{foremost}} {{weapon in}} its {{fight against the}} Mysterons after {{the events of the}} pilot episode, in which the Mysterons threaten to assassinate the World President as their first act of retaliation. The original Captain Scarlet is {{killed in a car accident}} engineered by the Mysterons and replaced with a re-created Mysteron likeness. However, when the Captain Scarlet duplicate is shot by Spectrum officer Captain Blue and falls to his death from a tall structure, he returns to life with the consciousness and the normal personality of the original Captain Scarlet fully restored let alone his memories of Mysteron control, and thereafter he is free from Mysteron control. Captain Scarlet's Mysteronised body possesses two remarkable abilities: he is able to sense the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> Mysteron duplicates in his vicinity, and if he is injured or killed, his retro-metabolism restores him to a state of top health. Now able to deploy suicidally reckless tactics to thwart Mysteron threats, Captain Scarlet repeatedly braves the pain of death in the knowledge that he will recover to face the Mysterons again.|$|E
5|$|Impala are symbiotically {{related to}} oxpeckers, which feed on ticks from {{those parts of}} the antelope's body which the animal cannot access by itself (such as the ears, neck, eyelids, {{forehead}} and underbelly). The impala is the smallest ungulate with which oxpeckers are associated. In a study it was observed that oxpeckers selectively attended to impala despite the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> animals such as Coke's hartebeest, Grant's gazelle, Thompson's gazelle and topi. A possible explanation for this could be that because the impala inhabits woodlands (which can have a high density of ticks), the impala could have greater mass of ticks per unit area of the body surface. Another study showed that the oxpeckers prefer the ears over other parts of the body, probably because these parts show maximum tick infestation.|$|E

CAS was convinced that the furosemide found was not aimed at improving athletic performance or masking the use of some other performance-enhancing substance.|$|E
5|$|In early 2010, Kieswetter {{achieved}} his target; {{some strong}} performances for the England Lions, {{especially in a}} match against the senior England team, won him {{a place in the}} squad to face Bangladesh. His selection, along with the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> South African-born players in the England team, was criticised; some commentators suggested there should be fewer foreign-born players in the team. Kieswetter scored his only international century in his third match, and a couple of months later he was the man of the match in the final when England won the 2010 ICC World Twenty20. After a promising start for England, he was dropped owing to his inconsistency before the end of 2010. He returned to the team the following year, but his place was insecure, and in 2013 he was replaced by Jos Buttler, his teammate at Somerset.|$|E
5|$|Methods for {{controlling}} {{the spread of}} Armillaria root rot include physical removal of infected trees, stumps and large roots; fumigation of soil around infected hosts; and injection of fumigants directly into infected hosts. These methods are often not practical due to high cost, introduction of toxic chemicals that affect other organisms, or health and safety issues for the operator. Biological control is another method that has been investigated to control root rot caused by A.luteobubalina. In one study, thinning stumps of Eucalyptus diversicolor were simultaneously inoculated with A.luteobubalina {{and one of the}} saprobic wood decay fungi Coriolus versicolor, Stereum hirsutum and Xylaria hypoxylon; all three fungi significantly reduced infection by A.luteobubalinea. These results were echoed in another study of stumps in karri regrowth forests, where it was shown that the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> wood decay fungi suppressed the growth of A.luteobubalina on the stump base.|$|E
50|$|In 1956, Robert Zajonc {{was trying}} to figure out why some studies showed people's {{performance}} being hindered by the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>others</b> rather than being made more accurate. He designed an experiment that would examine the performance of someone doing a simple vs. complex task in front <b>of</b> <b>others.</b> He found that, when people were performing a simple task in the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>others,</b> they could complete it with greater accuracy than when they were alone. This was something most psychologist were aware of at this time. However, what Zajonc found that was revolutionary in this time period was that, when people attempt to perform tasks which are more complex or with which they are not familiar, they complete it with less accuracy when in the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>others</b> than when they alone. Thus, social inhibition was born.|$|R

5|$|Co-evolution {{hypothesis}} : This is {{also called}} the virus-first hypothesis and proposes that viruses may have evolved from complex molecules of protein and nucleic acid {{at the same time}} as cells first appeared on Earth and would have been dependent on cellular life for billions of years. Viroids are molecules of RNA that are not classified as viruses because they lack a protein coat. However, they have characteristics that are common to several viruses and are often called subviral agents. Viroids are important pathogens of plants. They do not code for proteins but interact with the host cell and use the host machinery for their replication. The hepatitis delta virus of humans has an RNA genome similar to viroids but has a protein coat derived from hepatitis B virus and cannot produce one of its own. It is, therefore, a defective virus. Although hepatitis delta virus genome may replicate independently once inside a host cell, it requires the help of hepatitis B virus to provide a protein coat so that it can be transmitted to new cells. In similar manner, the sputnik virophage is dependent on mimivirus, which infects the protozoan Acanthamoeba castellanii. These viruses, which are dependent on the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> virus species in the host cell, are called satellites and may represent evolutionary intermediates of viroids and viruses.|$|E
5|$|Various {{antibodies}} {{directed at}} nerve cells {{have been reported}} in Guillainâ€“BarrÃ© syndrome. In the axonal subtype, these antibodies have been shown to bind to gangliosides, a group of substances found in peripheral nerves. A ganglioside is a molecule consisting of ceramide bound to a small group of hexose-type sugars and containing various numbers of N-acetylneuraminic acid groups. The key four gangliosides against which antibodies have been described are GM1, GD1a, GT1a, and GQ1b, with different anti-ganglioside antibodies being associated with particular features; for instance, GQ1b antibodies have been linked with Miller Fisher variant GBS and related forms including Bickerstaff encephalitis. The production of these antibodies after an infection is probably the result of molecular mimicry, where the immune system is reacting to microbial substances but the resultant antibodies also react with substances occurring naturally in the body. After a Campylobacter infection, the body produces antibodies of the IgA class; only a small proportion of people also produce IgG antibodies against bacterial substance cell wall substances (e.g. lipooligosaccharides) that crossreact with human nerve cell gangliosides. It is not currently known how this process escapes central tolerance to gangliosides, which is meant to suppress the production of antibodies against the body's own substances. Not all antiganglioside antibodies cause disease, and it has recently been suggested that some antibodies bind to more than one type of epitope simultaneously (heterodimeric binding) and that this determines the response. Furthermore, the development of pathogenic antibodies may depend on the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> strains of bacteria in the bowel.|$|E
