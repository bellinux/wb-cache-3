500|$|Although {{passage in}} the House was less {{controversial}} {{than it was in}} the Senate because the constitutional issues did not dominate consideration, the bill met with other <b>procedural</b> <b>obstacles.</b> At the time, Congress was under siege for what was widely perceived as abuse of members' franking privileges. In April, the House had approved H.R. 3180 to clarify what was and was not proper use of franking, and the Senate amended the bill on October 11. The House requested a conference, but the Senate delayed. Supposedly, Senate Post Office and Civil Service Committee Chairman Gale McGee was delaying the franking bill until the Senate-passed post card voter registration bill (...) was put to a House vote. Thus, at first the House inserted franking language in its Saxbe fix bill. On December 3, it suspended its rules to pass the bill 261–129. The Senate then passed the Saxbe fix bill (...) on December 6 without the franking language. The House agreed to the amended bill on December 7. On December 10, Nixon officially submitted the Saxbe nomination. The Judiciary Committee approved Saxbe on December 13 and the full senate confirmed him on December 17 by a 75–10 vote. Ten Democratic senators cited constitutional concerns in opposing this move. Senator Robert C. Byrd, who felt the bar was not avoidable by legislation, explained his position at the time: [...] " [...] so clear that it can't be waived…. We should not delude the American people into thinking a way can be found around the constitutional obstacle." [...] Saxbe did not resign his Senate seat until January 4, 1974, when his wife became eligible for survivor benefits after the completion of his fifth year of service. This delayed his transition to the Cabinet because the Clause expressly prohibits dual service. Saxbe later wrote that although he needed the additional salary he lost (he was earning $42,500 per year as a senator), he was still willing to serve as Attorney General and would get by financially. His biggest fear was that the fix would be ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court several months after he had been in office, and he would have to repay salary already spent.|$|E

40|$|Global Positioning Systems (GPS) provide law {{enforcement}} {{with a powerful}} tool to covertly investigate criminal networks. These networks, however, are often themselves technologically sophisticatedand thus able to elude police surveillance. GPS monitoring has drawn substantial criticism recently as police, in many jurisdictions, may utilize the technology without a search warrant; the issue has boiled down to whether the Fourth Amendment requires a search warrant in the first place. This Comment argues that the Supreme Court should establish a new rule, “Reasonable Suspicion Plus,” that would require police to state in a sworn declaration particularized reasoning for use of a GPS device, but that would not require them to obtain a search warrant. The benefits of the proposed rule would be threefold: (1) temporal and spatial limitations would assure that GPS technology is utilized responsibly; (2) the declaration {{would serve as a}} <b>procedural</b> <b>obstacle</b> requiring police to show good cause for using the device; and (3) when the declaration is registered with the district attorney’s office it would provide a tangible record, facilitating judicial review if a defendant later contests the legitimacy of the operation. Part I examines the concept of “a reasonable expectation of privacy” in the context of how the police use new technologies to monitor suspects’ movements. Part II dissects the shortcomings of those decisions but also points to valid considerations and concerns that arose in those cases. Part III proposes a model rule that can serve as a guidepost for appropriate use of GPS surveillance: “Reasonable Suspicion Plus. ” There are valid concerns {{on both sides of the}} argument, and the rule that this Comment proposes would address those concerns, while maintaining constitutionality and deference to Supreme Court precedent...|$|R

40|$|Everyone {{knows that}} {{excessive}} caseloads, poor funding, {{and a lack}} of training plague indigent defense delivery systems throughout the states, such that the promise of Gideon v. Wainwright is largely unfulfilled. Commentators have disagreed about how best to breathe life into Gideon. Many disclaim any possibility that federal habeas corpus review of state criminal cases could catalyze reform give n the many <b>procedural</b> <b>obstacle</b> s that currently prevent state prisoners from getting into federal court. But the Supreme Court has recently taken a renewed interest in using federal habeas review {{to address the problem of}} ineffective attorneys in state criminal cases. Last year, in Martinez v. Ryan, the Supreme Court relied on equitable principles to sweep aside procedural barriers to federal habeas review and permit state prisoners to raise ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims in federal court. Not surprisingly, many lower courts have resisted the Supreme Court’s recent attempts to permit state prisoners to have their ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims heard on the merits. But this battle is far from over. After documenting the ways in which lower courts are restrictively interpreting the Supreme Court’s recent decisions expanding the grounds for cause to excuse a state prisoner’s procedural default of an ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim, I will suggest that the defendants still have an important equitable card to play. That card is the idea of adequacy. As lower courts attempt to re-characterize state procedures so as to avoid recent Supreme Court holdings that would open the federal doors to state prisoners’ ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims, they inadvertently set themselves up for challenges to the adequacy of their state procedures. This shift is significant, I will explain, because of important differences in how cause and adequacy arguments influence state behavior. Whereas cause grounds are typically personal to the defendant, adequacy challenges are often used to expose systemic failures in a state’s procedures. As a result, adequacy challenges have more potential to catalyze change in states’ procedures...|$|R

The components of the congress—the ulema, the FEI, and communists—were heartened by the proposal and gave it varying measures of support. Mohamed Bendjelloul and Abbas, as spokesmen for the évolués, who would have the most to gain from the measure, considered this plan a major step toward achieving their aims and redoubled their efforts through the liberal FEI to gain broad support for the policy of Algerian integration with France. Not unexpectedly, however, the colons had taken uncompromising exception to the Blum-Viollette proposal. Although the project would have granted immediate French citizenship and voting rights to only about 21,000 Muslims, with provision for adding a few thousand more each year, spokesmen for the colons raised the specter of the European electorate's being submerged by a Muslim majority.

While there has been a recent explosion of interest in “access to justice,” little attention has been paid to how we might conceptualize access to justice in a manner that speaks meaningfully to the circumstances of women who experience abuse in their intimate relationships. For such women, access to justice is curtailed not only by lack of representation, delays, costs, and <b>procedural</b> complexities—the <b>obstacles</b> commonly associated with access to justice failings—but by three inter-related phenomena: the enduring hold of an incident-based understanding of domestic violence; the failure of legal actors to curb men’s strategic use of legal systems to further their power; and the host of complications—contradictory expectations, inconsistent orders, repetitious proceedings, sweeping surveillance—that arise when women are compelled to navigate multiple intersecting legal systems.

The literature identifies some {{of the factors that}} lead municipalities to join relevant policy networks, but provides little guidance for overcoming the aforementioned obstacles and adopting policies to reduce community-wide GHG emissions.

My research is based upon a survey of 255 US municipalities. I combine the survey responses with secondary data and use multiple regression techniques to estimate the impact of fifteen demographic, political – institutional, economic, and environmental variables on the adoption of climate mitigation plans and policies. The influence of neighboring jurisdictions, the presence of staff members assigned to energy or climate planning, and the level of community environmental activism are found to have the greatest impact on climate mitigation policy adoption. These findings support the conclusion that the extent of climate mitigation planning is driven primarily by internal processes, and municipalities that are successful in this area do not fit any one profile according to their demographic, economic, or environmental characteristics. ...|$|R

Using a combination of available literature and an interview-based case study, this paper examines the implementation of energy conservation and investigates impediments to achieving China's conservation goal in the electric power generation sector. Three key impediments are detailed: (1) municipal governments' incentives to overlook conservation-related central directives primarily because of budget pressures linked to financial decentralization, (2) <b>procedural</b> <b>obstacles</b> in the form of time required to obtain project approvals for high-efficiency power generation units, and (3) financial obstacles making it difficult for power generation enterprises to raise capital for energy conservation projects.

The two datasets include the same states as MIPEX as well as a half-a-dozen non-EU European states (Iceland, Macedonia, Montenegro, and Serbia). Both sets of indicators included many additional aspects of naturalisation not covered by MIPEX and coded applying a 0 -to- 1 coding scale. This report measures ordinary naturalisation policies through a simple average of the CITLAW combined indicator on the ordinary naturalisation law (ANATORD) and the overall indicator on ordinary naturalisation administrative procedures (CITIMP).

Also at a deeper accountability level, criminal litigation may be preferable on the ground that criminal punishment sends a stronger accountability and deterrence signal than a mere money judgment.

The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) contains two human rights of relevance: the right to credit as an aspect of women’s socioeconomic life and their right to access agricultural credit in the rural context. An examination of state party reports submitted under CEDAW considers four obstacles impeding women’s access to credit: lack of land ownership, their marital status, so-called sociocultural barriers and the commercial practices of financial institutions. These obstacles are replicated to varying degrees in the local context. The existence and ambit of a human right to access financial services for women in Australia {{can be derived from}} an analysis of consumer credit law, orthodox contractual principles and antidiscrimination legislation. Although the relevant jurisprudence yields important debtor entitlements and the obligations of credit providers, it also suggests several substantive and <b>procedural</b> <b>obstacles</b> hampering the common law development of that right. More explicit resort to a human rights framework, as illustrated by other jurisdictions, is warranted and justifiable...|$|E
40|$|Post-conviction DNA testing first exonerated an {{innocent}} prisoner {{nearly twenty years}} ago. During this period, we have learned many lessons from the 200 subsequent DNA exonerations, including insight into the factors that led to those wrongful convictions at trial and the <b>procedural</b> <b>obstacles</b> that can {{make it difficult for}} inmates whose cases contain biological evidence to procure DNA testing after conviction. Yet, as I have often written in the past, these exonerations are {{just the tip of the}} proverbial innocence iceberg. As a threshold matter, very few criminal investigations result in the collection of biological evidence whatsoever; over time, moreover, such evidence often becomes lost, destroyed, or degraded. This signifies that inmates proclaiming their innocence rarely have the benefit of utilizing the tool of DNA testing. In addition, the rate of DNA exonerations is bound to shrink in the future as DNA testing at the front end of the process becomes ubiquitous and thereby reduces the likelihood of miscarriages of justice in prosecutions in which biological evidence is available. Accordingly, the prevention and correction of wrongful convictions in cases lacking biological evidence are issues of critical importance and the focus of this symposium. Specifically, this Symposium represents an opportunity for several prominent scholars to float trial balloons testing theories related to the problem of wrongful convictions in the post-DNA world...|$|E
40|$|As I {{was putting}} {{together}} notes for this paper in early May, the newspapers brought home pictures more disturbing than the scholarly books: Iranian judges had ruled for a shutdown of reformist newspapers and {{the arrest of}} their editors, allies of President Khatami. During {{the first round of}} parliamentary elections weeks earlier, reformist groups had won a resounding victory; the court's move was read as a delayed reaction on the part of conservatives. Meanwhile, a world away in Chile, judges were clearing away <b>procedural</b> <b>obstacles</b> to a trial of senator-for-life and former president Augusto Pinochet. It was hard not to think of the situation some years back, when Chile's justices upheld the coup, treated Pinochet as a champion of judicial independence, and declined to act on the widespread human rights violations his government had countenanced. 2 Both these moves are controversial, but their political significance is unmistakable. On what authority does a court take such a course? Are judges answerable for their acts and omissions? Should they be? And to whom would they be accountable? Asking judges to be both independent and accountable would appear to be a contradiction in terms. Judicial independence refers, grosso modo, to a state in which other powers are prohibited from interfering in a case brought before the courts; accountability refers to th...|$|E
