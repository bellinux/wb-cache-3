5|$|Eyes: Kayser–Fleischer rings (KF rings), a <b>pathognomonic</b> <b>sign,</b> may {{be visible}} in the cornea of the eyes, either {{directly}} or on slit lamp examination as deposits of copper in a ring around the cornea. They are due to copper deposition in Descemet's membrane. They do not occur in all people with Wilson's disease. Wilson's disease is also associated with sunflower cataracts exhibited by brown or green pigmentation of the anterior and posterior lens capsule. Neither cause significant visual loss. KF rings occur in approximately 66% of diagnosed cases (more often in those with neurological symptoms rather than with liver problems).|$|E

50|$|In {{the finding}} of a <b>pathognomonic</b> <b>sign</b> or symptom it is almost certain that the target {{condition}} is present, {{and in the absence}} of finding a sine qua non sign or symptom it is almost certain that the target condition is absent.

50|$|While some {{findings}} may be classic, typical or highly suggestive {{in a certain}} condition, they may not occur uniquely in this condition and therefore may not directly imply a specific diagnosis. A <b>pathognomonic</b> <b>sign</b> or symptom has very high specificity but {{does not need to}} have high sensitivity: for example it can sometimes be absent in a certain disease, since the term only implies that, when it is present, the doctor instantly knows the patient's illness. The presence of a pathognomonic finding allows immediate diagnosis, since there are no other conditions in the differential diagnosis.|$|E
50|$|Pain {{following}} alcohol consumption: classically, involved nodes are painful after alcohol consumption, {{though this}} phenomenon is very uncommon, occurring in only two to three percent of people with Hodgkin's lymphoma, thus having a low sensitivity. On the other hand, its positive predictive value is high enough {{for it to be}} regarded as a <b>pathognomonic</b> <b>sign</b> of Hodgkin lymphoma. The pain typically has an onset within minutes after ingesting alcohol, and is usually felt as coming from the vicinity where there is an involved lymph node. The pain has been described as either sharp and stabbing or dull and aching.|$|E

40|$|White spot {{syndrome}} virus (WSSV) is {{the most}} important pathogen known to affect the sustainability and growth of the global penaeid shrimp farming industry. Although most commonly associated with penaeid shrimp farmed in warm waters, WSSV is also able to infect, cause disease in and kill a wide range of other decapod crustaceans, including lobsters, from temperate regions. In 2005, the European Union imported US$ 500 million worth of raw frozen or cooked frozen commodity products, much of which originated in regions positive for white spot disease (WSD). The presence of WSSV within the UK food market was verified by means of nested PCR performed on samples collected from a small-scale survey of supermarket commodity shrimp. Passage trials using inoculum derived from commodity shrimp from supermarkets and delivered by injection to specific pathogen-free Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei led to rapid mortality and <b>pathognomonic</b> <b>signs</b> of WSD in the shrimp, demonstrating that WSSV present within commodity shrimp was viable. We exposed a representative European decapod crustacean, the European lobster Homarus gammarus, to a single feeding of WSSV-positive, supermarket-derived commodity shrimp, and to positive control material (L. vannamei infected with a high dose of WSSV). These trials demonstrated that lobsters fed positive control (high dose) frozen raw products succumbed to WSD and displayed <b>pathognomonic</b> <b>signs</b> associated with the disease as determined by means of histology and transmission electron microscopy. Lobsters fed WSSV-positive, supermarket-derived commodity shrimp (low dose) did not succumb to WSD (no mortality or <b>pathognomonic</b> <b>signs</b> of WSD) but demonstrated a low level or latent infection via PCR. This study confirms susceptibility of H. gammarus to WSSV via single feedings of previously frozen raw shrimp products obtained directly from supermarkets. K. S. Bateman, J. Munro, B. Uglow, H. J.

50|$|Bell's {{phenomenon}} (also {{known as}} the palpebral oculogyric reflex) is a medical sign that allows observers to notice an upward and outward movement of the eye, when an attempt is made to close the eyes. The upward movement of the eye {{is present in the}} majority of the population, and is a defensive mechanism. The phenomenon is named after the Scottish anatomist, surgeon, and physiologist Charles Bell.Bell's phenomenon is a normal defense reflex present in about 75% of the population, resulting in elevation of the globes when blinking or when threatened (e.g. when an attempt is made to touch a patient's cornea). It becomes noticeable only when the orbicularis oculi muscle becomes weak as in, for example, bilateral facial palsy associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome. It is, however, present behind forcibly closed eyelids in most healthy people and should not be regarded as a <b>pathognomonic</b> <b>sign.</b>|$|E
