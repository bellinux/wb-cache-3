5|$|A {{total of}} eighty T28E1s were {{produced}} from July to August 1942 by White, {{all of which}} had a mount lacking <b>protection</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> gun combination and crew. After this initial run the vehicle gained an armored mount and went into production as the M15 CGMC. Some of the T28E1s still in service had their 37 mm guns removed and were converted into M3A1 Halftracks.|$|E
5|$|Fresh {{concerns}} grew {{that the}} Thames might {{be vulnerable to}} attack from torpedo boats and armoured cruisers, and in 1903 four quick-firing 12-pounder, 12 cwt (5.4 kg, 50.8 kg) guns were positioned on Tilbury's south-east curtain wall, supplemented in 1904 by two 6-inch (15 cm) breech loading guns. In 1905, however, the government decided that the Royal Navy and the forts downstream gave sufficient <b>protection</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> capital and removed the artillery, leaving only machine-guns in place.|$|E

Prior to the settlement, more than 90% of the state’s surface waters {{were not required to}} be clean enough for safe recreational use.

5|$|The spongy {{bones of}} the woodpecker's skull and the {{flexibility}} of its beak, both of which provide <b>protection</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> brain when drumming, have provided inspiration to engineers; a black box needs to survive intact when a plane falls from the sky, and modelling the black box with regard to a woodpecker's anatomy has increased the resistance of this device to damage sixty-fold.

5000|$|U.S. District Judge Donald Molloy {{ruled in}} an appealed {{decision}} on August 6, 2010, that the northern Rocky Mountain wolf must either be [...] "listed as {{an endangered species}} or removed from the list, but <b>the</b> <b>protections</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> same population can't be different for each state." [...] This ruling came about from the challenged decision in 2009 by wildlife groups and would end many of the special regulations that individual states had held over the species. The Fish and Wildlife Service made a statement that endangered <b>protections</b> would remain <b>for</b> <b>the</b> entire species until Wyoming is able to bring the population of wolves within its borders into required standards. <b>The</b> populations <b>for</b> Idaho and Montana have already exceeded the requirements and, thus, previously had had no <b>protections</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> wolves in the states.|$|R
5|$|After {{five to six}} instars, the nymphs will molt into adults. The male's forceps {{will become}} curved, while the females' forceps remain straight. They will also develop their natural color, which can be {{anything}} from a light brown (as in the Tawny earwig) to a dark black (as in the Ringlegged earwig). In species of winged earwigs, the wings will start to develop at this time. The forewings of an earwig are sclerotized to serve as <b>protection</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> membranous hindwings.|$|E
5|$|Brazza's martin may be hunted by humans, {{and both}} species may be {{infected}} {{with a variety}} of parasites. These swallows may be affected by poor weather when breeding, but neither appears to be under serious threat. The small islands which are the home of the Mascarene martin subspecies P. b. borbonica may be devastated by cyclones, which have the potential to cause severe temporary losses to the populations on Mauritius and Réunion. The legal protection afforded to the Phedina martins varies with jurisdiction, and ranges from none for Mascarene martins on Réunion to special <b>protection</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> same species on Madagascar. The Brazza's martin is not a protected species anywhere in its range.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of Britain, Hitler {{gave the}} German armed forces (Wehrmacht) a {{directive}} (Directive No. 16) that ordered provisional preparations for invasion of Britain.

The Luftwaffe was to destroy the RAF {{in order to prevent}} it from attacking the invasion fleet or providing <b>protection</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Royal Navy's Home Fleet which might attempt to prevent a landing by sea. On 1 August Hitler gave the Luftwaffes commander-in-chief, Reichsmarschall (Empire Marshal) Hermann Göring and the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (High Command of the Air Force) a (Directive No. 17) to launch the air assault.|$|E

5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1793, war and {{internal}} disorder had combined with poor weather to leave France facing starvation following {{the collapse of the}} harvest. France's ongoing conflict with her neighbours precluded overland imports; the only nation willing and able to sell grain to the National Convention was the United States. Importing food from the Americas was a highly risky venture, as the British Royal Navy—at war with France since early 1793—patrolled much of the Atlantic passage. To provide effective <b>protection</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> vessels involved, a plan was agreed between France and the United States to collect the supplies over a period of months and transport them in a single convoy. A gathering point was arranged at Hampton Roads in the Chesapeake Bay.|$|E

Before Lincoln's presidency, Thanksgiving, while a regional holiday in New England since the 17th century, had been proclaimed by the federal government only sporadically and on irregular dates. The last such proclamation had been during James Madison's presidency 50 years before. In 1863, Lincoln declared the final Thursday in November of that year to be a day of Thanksgiving. In June 1864, Lincoln approved the Yosemite Grant enacted by Congress, which provided unprecedented federal <b>protection</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> area now known as Yosemite National Park.|$|E
