5|$|An {{infection}} with Spirochetes (a bacterium) in gum disease may cause dementia {{and may be}} involved in the <b>pathogenesis</b> of Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
5|$|Study of the H. pylori genome is {{centered}} on attempts to understand <b>pathogenesis,</b> the ability of this organism to cause disease. About 29% of the loci have acolonization defectwhen mutated. Two of sequenced strains have an around 40-kb-long Cag pathogenicity island (a common gene sequence believed responsible for <b>pathogenesis)</b> that contains over 40 genes. This pathogenicity island is usually absent from H. pylori strains isolated from humans who are carriers of H. pylori but remain asymptomatic.|$|E
5|$|DPB is idiopathic, {{which means}} an exact physiological, environmental, or {{pathogenic}} {{cause of the}} disease is unknown. However, several factors are suspected {{to be involved with}} its <b>pathogenesis</b> (the way in which the disease works).|$|E

5|$|The vast {{majority}} of endometrial cancers are carcinomas (usually adenocarcinomas), meaning that they originate from the single layer of epithelial cells that line the endometrium and form the endometrial glands. There are many microscopic subtypes of endometrial carcinoma, but they are broadly organized into two categories, Type I and Type II, based on clinical features and <b>pathogenesis.</b> The two subtypes are genetically distinct.|$|E

25|$|The <b>pathogenesis</b> of BSE is {{not well}} {{understood}} or documented like other diseases of this nature. Even though BSE is a disease that results in neurological defects, its <b>pathogenesis</b> occurs in areas that reside outside of the nervous system. There was a strong deposition of PrPSc initially located in the Ileal Peyer’s patches of the small intestine. The lymphatic system has been identified in the <b>pathogenesis</b> of scrapies, it has not, however, been determined to be {{an essential part of}} the <b>pathogenesis</b> of BSE. The Ileal Peyer’s patches have been the only organ from this system that has been found to play a major role in the <b>pathogenesis.</b> Infectivity of the Ileal Peyer's patches has been observed as early as 4 months after inoculation. PrPSc accumulation was found to occur mostly in tangible body macrophages of the Ileal Peyer’s patches. Tangible body macrophages involved in PrPSc clearance are thought to play a role in PrPSc accumulation in the Peyer’s patches. Accumulation of PrPSc was also found in follicular dendritic cells; however, it was of a lesser degree. Six months after inoculation, there was no infectivity in any tissues, only that of the ileum. This led researchers to believe that the disease agent replicates here. In naturally confirmed cases, there have been no reports of infectivity in the Ileal Peyer’s patches. Generally, in clinical experiments, high doses of the disease are administered. In natural cases, it was hypothesized that low doses of the agent were present, and therefore, infectivity could not be observed.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the three fundamental factors underlying chronic wound <b>pathogenesis</b> are cellular and systemic changes of aging, repeated bouts of ischemia-reperfusion injury, and bacterial colonization with resulting inflammatory host response.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, a {{case study}} of a woman with ulcers {{on the back of her}} leg {{reported}} as being diagnosed with PNP. The underlying tumors are almost exclusively of B-cell lineage. However, T-cells and CD56+ Natural Killer cells have also been postulated to be associated effectors of paraneoplastic pemphigus. This case demonstrated the rare association between Natural Killer cell lymphoma and PNP, suggesting that Natural Killer cells could be involved in the <b>pathogenesis</b> of PNP. The article warned clinicians to be alert to the possibility that paraneoplastic pemphigus in lymphomas not of B-cell lineage. This added to the already complex, not fully understood <b>pathogenesis</b> of PNP.|$|E
25|$|Adhesion is an {{important}} component of <b>pathogenesis.</b> The yeast form of S. schenckii shows an increased ability to bind to the host extracellular matrix proteins fibronectin and laminin using two separate receptors specific for these proteins.|$|E
25|$|Beyond genetics, {{epigenetic}} abnormality {{related to}} DNA methylation, histone acetylation, or microRNA expression probably have key {{roles in the}} <b>pathogenesis</b> of autoimmune diseases, including SS, though {{research in this area}} is very limited and minimal.|$|E
25|$|Epidemiological {{studies have}} {{suggested}} a correlation between chronic consumption of drinking water contaminated with arsenic and the incidence of all leading causes of mortality. The literature indicates that arsenic exposure is causative in the <b>pathogenesis</b> of diabetes.|$|E
25|$|Epigenetics is {{the study}} of the {{regulation}} of gene expression through chemical, non-mutational changes in DNA structure. The theory of epigenetics in cancer <b>pathogenesis</b> is that non-mutational changes to DNA can lead to alterations in gene expression. Normally, oncogenes are silent, for example, because of DNA methylation. Loss of that methylation can induce the aberrant expression of oncogenes, leading to cancer <b>pathogenesis.</b> Known mechanisms of epigenetic change include DNA methylation, and methylation or acetylation of histone proteins bound to chromosomal DNA at specific locations. Classes of medications, known as HDAC inhibitors and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, can re-regulate the epigenetic signaling in the cancer cell.|$|E
25|$|In {{approximately}} 60 {{percent of}} cases, antibodies against platelets can be detected.nbsp& Most often these antibodies are against platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb-IIIa or Ib-IX, and {{are of the}} immunoglobulin G (IgG) type.

25|$|Neuroendocrine dysregulation: altered {{signalling}} of peptides {{that facilitate}} {{communication between the}} gut, brain and adipose tissue, such as ghrelin, leptin, neuropeptide Y and orexin, {{may contribute to the}} <b>pathogenesis</b> of anorexia nervosa by disrupting regulation of hunger and satiety.|$|E
25|$|S. mutans is {{implicated in}} the <b>pathogenesis</b> of certain {{cardiovascular}} diseases, and is the most prevalent bacterial species detected in extirpated heart valve tissues, {{as well as in}} atheromatous plaques, with an incidence of 68.6% and 74.1%, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Astroviruses cause {{gastroenteritis}} by causing {{destruction of}} the intestinal epithelium, leading to the inhibition of usual absorption mechanism, loss of secretory functions, and decrease in epithelial permeability in the intestines.

25|$|Impaired NO {{production}} {{is involved in}} the <b>pathogenesis</b> of several diseases such as hypertension, preeclampsia, diabetes mellitus, obesity, erectile dysfunction, and migraine. In this regard, a large number of studies showed that polymorphisms in NOS3 gene affect the susceptibility to these diseases.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pathogenesis</b> {{results from}} rupture of {{infected}} {{red blood cells}}, leading to fever. Infected red blood cells may also stick {{to each other and}} to walls of capillaries. Vessels plug up and deprive tissues of oxygen. Infection may also cause the spleen to enlarge.|$|E
25|$|Several {{diseases}} {{have been}} observed in patients with PMD. However, no causal relationships have been established between any of the associated diseases and the <b>pathogenesis</b> of PMD. Such diseases include: chronic open-angle glaucoma, retinitis pigmentosa, retinal lattice degeneration, scleroderma, kerato-conjunctivitis, eczema, and hyperthyroidism.|$|E
25|$|Oxidation {{by either}} COX or {{lipoxygenase}} releases {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) and the initial products in eicosanoid generation are themselves highly reactive peroxides. LTA4 can form adducts with tissue DNA. Other reactions of lipoxygenases generate cellular damage; murine models implicate 15-lipoxygenase in the <b>pathogenesis</b> of atherosclerosis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pathogenesis</b> {{appears to}} involve a {{compensatory}} mechanism: the mutated proteins act like “toxins” with a dominant effect, decreasing the heart’s ability to contract causing abnormal mechanical behaviour {{such that the}} hypertrophy, that is usually delayed, {{is a consequence of}} the cardiac muscle’s normal response to stress.|$|E
