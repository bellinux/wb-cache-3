5|$|After Khan's {{departure}} from Comilla, the cooperative's model failed in independent Bangladesh because {{only a few}} occupational groups managed to achieve the desired success. By 1979, only 61 of the 400 cooperatives were functioning. The model actually fell prey to the ineffective internal and external controls, stagnation, and diversion of funds. This prompted the subsequent scholars and practitioners in microfinance, such as Muhammad Yunus of Grameen Bank and Fazle Hasan Abed of BRAC, to abandon the cooperative approach in favour of more centralised control and service delivery structures. The new strategy targeted the poorest villagers, while excluding the 'less poor'.

40|$|This {{research}} reports on two action research {{case studies of}} <b>participatory</b> materials <b>development</b> in two rural community contexts in Zambia, namely Chiawa and Nalusanga. It aims to explore and articulate the relationships between community-based environmental education and <b>participatory</b> materials <b>development</b> in the WWF Zambia Education Project context; clarify <b>participatory</b> materials <b>development</b> processes by identifying the roles of different ‘actors’ in these processes and identify and analyse the contextual and other factors that may influence {{development and use of}} environmental education materials in rural communities. These aims were explored by means of a number of action research cycles of inquiry in the two communities. The study also articulates the significance of considering ambivalent globalising influences such as international conferences, debates, overseas development aid, national policies and how these shape and influence materials development work in a local context. In order to gain more insight into the local contexts, I developed contextual profiles on the two communities. These capture the contextual factors that influenced the <b>participatory</b> materials <b>development</b> processes. They include issues such as language, ethnicity, literacy, power relations and the local social economy, amongst others. Although this study has been predominately guided by the socially critical orientation to research and education, I have drawn on aspects of other research orientations. I have also explored some of the emerging critiques of the socially critical orientation. The findings of this study reveal the different roles participants can play in participatory materials development; <b>participatory</b> materials <b>development</b> processes as a learning process; the dynamics of participation in an African context; the role of language and literacy in materials development; the need for open-ended process models of learning amongst adult learners and the importance of merging expert and local knowledge in <b>participatory</b> materials <b>development.</b> This study opens up possibilities for further exploration of <b>participatory</b> materials <b>development</b> processes within the WWF ZEP context and beyond...|$|R

40|$|Implementing {{high-level}} {{radioactive wastes}} programs on a territory remain a sensitive step for nuclear waste management organizations. At this stage, the preferred solution of radioactive wastes programs (geological disposal) and their technological developments become highly visible {{and this is}} why the new instruments and strategies such as <b>participatory</b> technology <b>development</b> (PDT) have been adopted to tackle the territorial development of geological disposal technology. Considering the coproduction between territory and program (Jasanoff 2004), this presentation focuses on two siting processes of radioactive wastes programs, in France and in Canada to analyze the influence of in(sensible) local <b>participatory</b> technology <b>development</b> strategy and the influence of invited critics (Wynne 2007) on the industrial project.

40|$|In this paper, we outline a {{theoretical}} framework for understanding the role of technologies in interactions between scientists and farmers. Technologies are important mediators of relationships in modern, industrial agriculture. Scientists have attempted to make agricultural science more accessible for farmers through decision support systems (DSSs). However, the limited uptake by farmers of this form of technology has led to critical reflection on {{the development and implementation}} of agricultural DSSs. The shift towards <b>participatory</b> research and <b>development</b> approaches recognises the benefits of fostering collaborative and mutually beneficial relationships between scientists and practice communities. However, a more detailed analysis of the interaction between the multiple actors involved in <b>participatory</b> DSS <b>development</b> is required to identify principles to improve this process. We have developed {{a theoretical}} framework to analyse <b>participatory</b> DSS <b>development</b> in the Australian sugar industry.

We illustrate this framework with a case study of an irrigation scheduling DSS...|$|R

40|$|A methodological {{framework}} is proposed for <b>participatory</b> scenario <b>development</b> {{on the basis}} of evidence from the literature, and is tested and refined through the development of scenarios for the future of UK uplands. The paper uses a review of previous work to justify a framework based around the following steps: i) define context and establish whether there is a basis for stakeholder engagement in scenario development; ii) systematically identify and represent relevant stakeholders in the process; iii) define clear objectives for scenario development with stakeholders including spatial and temporal boundaries; iv) select relevant participatory methods for scenario development, during initial scenario construction, evaluation and to support decision-making based on scenarios; and v) integrate local and scientific knowledge throughout the process. The application of this framework in case study research suggests that <b>participatory</b> scenario <b>development</b> has the potential to: i) make scenarios more relevant to stakeholder needs and priorities; ii) extend the range of scenarios developed; iii) develop more detailed and precise scenarios through the integration of local and scientific knowledge; and iv) move beyond scenario development to facilitate adaptation to future change. It is argued that <b>participatory</b> scenario <b>development</b> can empower stakeholders and lead to more consistent and robust scenarios that can help people prepare more effectively for future change. © 2013 The Authors...|$|R
40|$|Evolving {{knowledge}} and professional practice combined with advances in pedagogy and learning technology create challenges for accredited professional programs. Internationally a sparsity of literature exists around curriculum development for professional programs responsive to regulatory and societal drivers. This paper evaluates a <b>participatory</b> curriculum <b>development</b> framework, {{adapted from the}} community development sector, to determine its applicability to promote engagement and ownership during {{the development of a}} Bachelor of Midwifery curriculum at an Australian University. The structures, processes and resulting curriculum development framework are described. A representative sample of key curriculum development team members were interviewed in relation to their participation. Qualitative analysis of transcribed interviews occurred through inductive, essentialist thematic analysis. Two main themes emerged: (1) ‘it is a transformative journey’ and (2) focused ‘partnership in action’. Results confirmed the <b>participatory</b> curriculum <b>development</b> process provides symbiotic benefits to participants leading to individual and organisational growth and the perception of a shared curriculum. A final operational model using a <b>participatory</b> curriculum <b>development</b> process to guide the development of accredited health programs emerged. The model provides an appropriate structure to create meaningful collaboration with multiple stakeholders to produce a curriculum that is contemporary, underpinned by evidence and reflective of ‘real world’ practice.
