5|$|In mathematics, {{the polar}} {{coordinate}} {{system is a}} two-dimensional coordinate system in which each point on a <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> determined by a distance from a reference point and an angle from a reference direction.|$|E
50|$|Ray Melikian's <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> {{found in}} a junkyard in Australia in 1974. The <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> badly damaged and was in many parts.|$|R
50|$|Three of the Farman <b>planes</b> <b>were</b> christened Aetos, Gyps, and Ierax. The <b>planes</b> <b>were</b> {{paid for}} by money donated by a poet named Matsoukis.|$|R
50|$|A general {{rotation}} is not simple, and has {{the maximum}} number of planes of rotation as given above. In the general case the angles of rotations in these <b>planes</b> <b>are</b> distinct and the <b>planes</b> <b>are</b> uniquely defined. If any of the angles are the same then the <b>planes</b> <b>are</b> not unique, as in four dimensions with an isoclinic rotation.|$|R
5|$|Because the {{ingredients}} of this equation, the arc length, curvature, and time, are all unaffected by translations and rotations of the Euclidean plane, {{it follows that the}} flow defined by this equation is invariant under translations and rotations (or more precisely, equivariant). If the <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> scaled by a constant dilation factor, the flow remains essentially unchanged, but is slowed down or sped up by the same factor.|$|E
5|$|Bond is recaptured {{after hearing}} {{the details of the}} operation, but he {{subsequently}} seduces Pussy Galore, Goldfinger's private pilot and convinces her to inform the American authorities. Goldfinger's private army break into Fort Knox and access the vault, where Bond fights and kills Oddjob, while American troops battle with Goldfinger's army outside. Bond's <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> hijacked by Goldfinger, but Bond struggles with him, and shoots out a window, creating an explosive decompression, killing Goldfinger.|$|E
5|$|Briggs {{uses his}} CIA {{credentials}} to have Fisher {{sent to the}} Guantanamo Bay detention camp, allowing him to continue interrogating Nouri. Nouri confirms that Sadiq {{is head of the}} Engineers, and says that Sadiq knows the identities of the Fourth Echelon leaders. Escaping from the prison, Briggs and Fisher reach the Paladin in Yucatán and escape when the <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> attacked by a Mexican drug cartel. Fourth Echelon restarts the plane with Kobin's help, and Sadiq executes a Blacklist attack on the largest U.S. gas reserve in Louisiana.|$|E
25|$|Though most <b>planes</b> <b>are</b> pushed {{across a}} piece of wood, holding it with one or both hands, Japanese <b>planes</b> <b>are</b> pulled toward the body, not pushed away.|$|R
25|$|Because {{foliation}} <b>planes</b> <b>are</b> <b>planes</b> of weakness, these fabrics {{within the}} rocks strongly influence landslide and debris flow hazards. Where the foliation <b>planes</b> <b>are</b> dipping towards a free surface, failure {{is likely to}} occur along these planes.|$|R

5|$|La Tante DC10 Restaurant, {{known locally}} as The Green <b>Plane,</b> <b>is</b> a public private {{partnership}} restaurant established in Accra. This operates from the defunct Ghana Airways McDonnell Douglas DC-10, which had been in operation as a passenger jet between 1983 and 2005. The restaurant serves staple Ghanaian dishes. The restaurant has been well received locally.|$|E
5|$|Max Fenig (Scott Bellis), {{last seen}} in Fallen Angel, is {{traveling}} on an airplane, Flight 549, which flies over upstate New York. He watches another {{man on the}} plane {{who seems to be}} following him. The man heads to the plane's bathroom, where he assembles a zip gun. However, when he comes back out, the airplane begins shaking and a bright light flashes outside, showing that the <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> encountering a UFO. The emergency door next to Max's seat is opened.|$|E
5|$|Snakes on a <b>Plane</b> <b>is</b> a 2006 American action thriller film {{directed}} by David R. Ellis and starring Samuel L. Jackson. It {{was released by}} New Line Cinema on August 18, 2006, in North America. The film was written by David Dalessandro, John Heffernan, and Sheldon Turner and follows the events of hundreds of snakes being released on a passenger plane {{in an attempt to}} kill a trial witness.|$|E
25|$|Generally all <b>planes</b> <b>are</b> used to flatten, {{reduce the}} {{thickness}} of, and impart a smooth surface to a rough piece of lumber or timber. <b>Planing</b> <b>is</b> {{also used to}} produce horizontal, vertical, or inclined flat surfaces on workpieces usually too large for shaping, where {{the integrity of the}} whole requires the same smooth surface. Special types of <b>planes</b> <b>are</b> designed to cut joints or decorative mouldings.|$|R
50|$|However, {{the head}} of Merpati stated that the spareparts delay and the tragedy of Flight 5601 was totally {{different}} and stated that if the <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> flying at the time, the <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> airworthy.|$|R
50|$|In the {{original}} Monster Manual (1977) by Gary Gygax, the only elementals that appeared {{were those of}} fire, air, water, and earth. In {{the original}} Players Handbook (1978), no para- or quasielemental <b>planes</b> <b>were</b> mentioned. The Inner <b>Planes</b> <b>were</b> described simply as above (Earth, Fire, Water, Air, and what were then called the Positive and Negative Material Planes). The Ethereal Plane and Prime Material <b>Plane</b> <b>were</b> also counted among their number.|$|R
5|$|Using the {{visualization}} of complex {{numbers in the}} complex plane, the addition has the following geometric interpretation: the sum of two complex numbers A and B, interpreted as points of the complex <b>plane,</b> <b>is</b> the point X obtained by building a parallelogram three of whose vertices are O, A and B. Equivalently, X is the point such that the triangles with vertices O, A, B, and X, B, A, are congruent.|$|E
5|$|Wang tiles are squares {{coloured}} on each edge, {{and placed}} so that abutting edges of adjacent tiles {{have the same}} colour; hence they are sometimes called Wang dominoes. A suitable set of Wang dominoes can tile the plane, but only aperiodically. This is known because any Turing machine can be represented {{as a set of}} Wang dominoes that tile the plane if and only if the Turing machine does not halt. Since the halting problem is undecidable, the problem of deciding whether a Wang domino set can tile the <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> also undecidable.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the game, the player is {{presented}} with a range of options that determine the experience. The game offers nine selectable levels of difficulty, including a tutorial difficulty in which the enemy forces do not fire back. Among the options, the player can choose to play either in summer or winter time and either daytime or nighttime, altering the scenery. The player must choose from the range of weapons that will be mounted on their AWAT plane. These include air-to-air, air-to-ground, air-to-sea and multipurpose missiles, depending on what enemies the player chooses to engage. In addition, the <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> equipped with a machine gun and decoy flares against hostile missiles.|$|E
50|$|Anomalous <b>planes</b> <b>are</b> <b>planes</b> {{which do}} not fit into other categories. The most {{prominent}} of these <b>planes</b> <b>are</b> the Realm of Dreams, which {{can be reached via}} the Astral Sea, and the Far Realm, which breaks through into the remote parts of the Astral and the world.|$|R
50|$|<b>Planing</b> <b>is</b> a {{manufacturing}} process of material removal {{in which the}} workpiece reciprocates against a stationary cutting tool producing a plane or sculpted surface. <b>Planing</b> <b>is</b> analogous to shaping. The main {{difference between these two}} processes is that in shaping the tool reciprocates across the stationary workpiece. <b>Planing</b> motion <b>is</b> the opposite of shaping. Both <b>planing</b> and shaping <b>are</b> rapidly being replaced by milling.|$|R
50|$|The {{fundamental}} <b>planes</b> <b>are</b> two vast expanses {{from which}} the other <b>planes</b> <b>were</b> formed. It was {{the conflict between the}} inhabitants of each fundamental plane that constituted the Dawn War. The two Fundamental <b>Planes</b> <b>are</b> theoretically infinite; it is implied that if one departs the world of one campaign setting and sets out through either the Astral Sea or the Elemental Chaos, they will eventually reach the worlds of other campaign settings.|$|R
5|$|Because Earth's {{rotational}} axis is not perpendicular to its orbital plane, Earth's equatorial <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> not coplanar with the ecliptic plane, but {{is inclined to}} it by an angle of about 23.4°, which {{is known as the}} obliquity of the ecliptic. If the equator is projected outward to the celestial sphere, forming the celestial equator, it crosses the ecliptic at two points known as the equinoxes. The Sun, in its apparent motion along the ecliptic, crosses the celestial equator at these points, one from south to north, the other from north to south. The crossing from south to north is known as the vernal equinox, also known as the first point of Aries and the ascending node of the ecliptic on the celestial equator. The crossing from north to south is the autumnal equinox or descending node.|$|E
5|$|Cortex sends his loyal Lab Assistants to {{find the}} pieces of the map {{scattered}} throughout the big City and bring them to him. Now that the contestants know about the map, the Viscount decides to reveal his true intentions: the Super Big Power Crystal can grant a single wish who whoever obtains it, and the Viscount is willing to give a large sum of money to those who help him find it. Finding the Power Crystal is impossible without the Final Key, so the Viscount boards his plane to travel to the North Atlantic Ocean in search for the Final Key. But the <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> full, and only a select number of the contestants are able to board. Propelled to the skies by an explosive volcano, the contestants are able to board the Viscount's plane.|$|E
5|$|Cubic {{diamonds}} have {{a perfect}} and easy octahedral cleavage, {{which means that they}} only have four planes—weak directions following the faces of the octahedron where there are fewer bonds—along which diamond can easily split upon blunt impact to leave a smooth surface. Similarly, diamond's hardness is markedly directional: the hardest direction is the diagonal on the cube face, 100 times harder than the softest direction, which is the dodecahedral plane. The octahedral <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> intermediate between the two extremes. The diamond cutting process relies heavily on this directional hardness, as without it a diamond would be nearly impossible to fashion. Cleavage also plays a helpful role, especially in large stones where the cutter wishes to remove flawed material or to produce more than one stone from the same piece of rough (e.g. Cullinan Diamond).|$|E
40|$|Using {{symplectic}} topology and the Radon transform, we {{prove that}} smooth 4 -dimensional projective <b>planes</b> <b>are</b> diffeomorphic to CP 2. We define {{the notion of}} a plane curve in a smooth projective plane, show that plane curves in high dimensional regular <b>planes</b> <b>are</b> lines, prove that homeomorphisms preserving <b>plane</b> curves <b>are</b> smooth collineations, and prove a variety o...|$|R
50|$|After the <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> {{lifted off}} the runway, the C829 circuit breaker was closed, and {{the landing gear}} was extended, using the {{alternate}} system. The <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> then towed to the LOT maintenance hangar, for repairs and further investigation.|$|R
50|$|The {{prototype}} of the DH.84 Dragon light passenger <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> originally called Dragon Moth, but later the 'moth' in its name was dropped as the <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> a civil airliner and the name 'moth' was {{to be used for}} sportsplanes only.|$|R
5|$|Europa orbits Jupiter in {{just over}} {{three and a half}} days, with an orbital radius of about 670,900km. With an {{eccentricity}} of only 0.009, the orbit itself is nearly circular, and the orbital inclination relative to Jupiter's equatorial <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> small, at 0.470°. Like its fellow Galilean satellites, Europa is tidally locked to Jupiter, with one hemisphere of Europa constantly facing Jupiter. Because of this, there is a sub-Jovian point on Europa's surface, from which Jupiter would appear to hang directly overhead. Europa's prime meridian is the line intersecting this point. Research suggests that the tidal locking may not be full, as a non-synchronous rotation has been proposed: Europa spins faster than it orbits, or at least did so in the past. This suggests an asymmetry in internal mass distribution and that a layer of subsurface liquid separates the icy crust from the rocky interior.|$|E
5|$|Flight Unlimited II is {{a flight}} {{simulator}} video game: its gameplay is a simulation of piloting real-world planes. Players may control the Piper PA-28R-200, de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver, Beechcraft Baron 58, North American P-51D Mustang or Cessna 172. The interactive cockpit of each <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> {{based on its}} real-world counterpart, and it contains simulated flight instruments such as an airspeed indicator, a heading indicator and a VOR indicator, among others. The player begins by engaging in a Quick Flight or by using the fixed-base operator (FBO) interface. In a Quick Flight, the player selects a plane and the flying conditions before taking off; the FBO interface features additional options, such as lessons, flight plans and adventures. The game's six lessons detail such maneuvers as takeoffs and taxiing. Adventures are pre-built missions, with objectives such as landing on an aircraft carrier, helping a prisoner to escape from Alcatraz Island or dropping turkeys into Candlestick Park. There are 25 adventures in total.|$|E
5|$|The Moon and Earth orbit {{a common}} {{barycenter}} every 27.32days {{relative to the}} background stars. When combined with the Earth–Moon system's common orbit around the Sun, {{the period of the}} synodic month, from new moon to new moon, is 29.53days. Viewed from the celestial north pole, the motion of Earth, the Moon, and their axial rotations are all counterclockwise. Viewed from a vantage point above the north poles of both the Sun and Earth, Earth orbits in a counterclockwise direction about the Sun. The orbital and axial planes are not precisely aligned: Earth's axis is tilted some 23.44degrees from the perpendicular to the Earth–Sun plane (the ecliptic), and the Earth–Moon <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> tilted up to ±5.1degrees against the Earth–Sun plane. Without this tilt, there would be an eclipse every two weeks, alternating between lunar eclipses and solar eclipses.|$|E
50|$|The <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> {{reported}} to be on sale in March 2011, even though repairs to the left wingtip and stabilizer were still being completed in August 2011. The <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> then sold to a private owner in 2013 registered XA-MHA.|$|R
50|$|On {{her second}} day off Okinawa Tennessee was {{attacked}} by four planes. The first <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> shot down 5,000 yd from Tennessees stern. Two minutes later the second <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> shot down 5500 yd from her stern. Five minutes, later a third <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> destroyed 5 mi away. The fourth <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> fired upon at 5,000 yards away and crashed 12000 yd off Tennessees bow. Tennessee was attacked again by airplanes on 1 and 3 April. These attacks were not suicide attacks. The first kamikaze attack came on 6 April. Tennessee fought off six kamikazes. On 7 April, a single kamikaze attacked Tennessee. Five days later, Tennessee faced the strongest kamikaze attack yet.|$|R
50|$|On {{the second}} day of the battle, the five {{available}} <b>planes</b> <b>were</b> ordered out to bomb the roads between Chambley and Mrs-le-Tour. Four planes left the ground, but one was forced to land in a nearby field. The other three continued the mission, and bombed the ammunition dump at Chambley from an altitude of 1000 Meters. The <b>planes</b> <b>were</b> surrounded at the objective by 15 enemy scouts. In the terrible fight which ensued, two <b>planes</b> <b>were</b> shot down, one went down in control, the second in flames. Lt. Gaylord, pilot and Lt. Rath, observer, managed to cut their way to the lines and landed safely at the airdrome. One enemy <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> shot down in the combat.|$|R
