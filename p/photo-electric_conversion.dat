As expected, the modified composite Pt CE showed excellent electrocatalytic activity and low charge transfer resistance of 3.11  Ω cm 2 through the extensive electrochemical measurements.

40|$|In {{the recent}} study of organic conductors, much {{interest}} {{has been focused on}} the development of new functional materials possessing multiple functionalities such as conductivity, magnetism and photonics and so on. Among them, interactions between conducting properties and photonics are also investigated in photoconducting materials and solar cells. Recently we focused on the development of photo-induced conducting materials based on the organic conductors and we reported new TTF derivatives substituted with 2, 5 -Diphenyl- 1, 3, 4 -oxadiazole (PPD) part which shows show strong fluorescence and can be used as an antenna for photo-excitation [1, 2]. On the other hand, 1, 3 -benzothiazole (BTA) ring is also known as a key part for photo-functional organic materials and has been used as cyanine dyes. Therefore, we designed new TTF derivatives 1 - 3 connected to the BTA part directly or through alkene spacers to realize novel photo-switchable conducting materials and <b>photo-electric</b> <b>conversion</b> materials. In this presentation, we will discuss about the synthesis, structures and physical properties of molecules 1 - 3 and N-methyl substituted cyanine-type salt 2 -Me •I. Furthermore, we will report on the photo-induced conductivity using a single crystal of molecule 2 (R = H) and <b>photo-electric</b> <b>conversion</b> functionality using thin films of these molecules that were spin-coated on ITO-coated glass substrate. ...|$|E
30|$|Since {{the report}} of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) in 1991 have {{attracted}} considerable attention due to their simple fabrication process, low production costs, relatively high conversion efficiency, and being environmental friendly [1 – 4]. So far, the highest <b>photo-electric</b> <b>conversion</b> efficiency of DSSCs has achieved of over 13  % [5] by depositing platinum (Pt) on a transparent conductive substrate. However, since Pt {{is a kind of}} limited resource to induce increase in cost and hider commercialize application, replacement or reduction of Pt has emerged as an important issue for further development of DSSCs.|$|E
40|$|Phase-pure perovskite-type SrTiO 3, CaTiO 3 and BaTiO 3 {{electrodes}} {{have been}} applied for dye-sensitized solar cells, to obtain higher VOC than TiO 2 electrode. Furthermore, TiO 2 /SrTiO 3 and TiO 2 /BaTiO 3 composite electrodes have been also prepared. SrTiO 3, CaTiO 3 and BaTiO 3 powders synthesized by solid-state reaction method at 1200 °C for 2 h were used to prepare the solar cells. Phase-pure SrTiO 3 and BaTiO 3 cells showed higher VOC than that from TiO 2, but showed lower JSC and efficiency. To utilize the positive effect to increase the VOC, P 25 TiO 2 /SrTiO 3 and P 25 TiO 2 /BaTiO 3 composite DSC were prepared.

40|$|Dye-sensitized {{solar cells}} (DSSC) {{attracted}} widespread attention for its low cost, being easy to manufacture, large-scale production and environmentally friendly features. Sensitizer is a core {{component of the}} DSSC which {{plays a role in}} collecting sunlight and injecting excited state electron into the conduction band of the semiconductor, which is crucial to the <b>photo-electric</b> <b>conversion</b> efficiency. Organic dyes have a number of advantages such as easy synthesizing and tuning of photo-physical and electrochemical properties through molecular design. Triphenylamine is a strong electron donating group, and its non-planar spatial structure makes the degree of the dye molecules aggregation to be decreased. These properties are conducive to improve the absorption properties of the dye and the electron transport efficiency. In recent years, triphenylamine or substituted triphenylamine as electron donor of organic sensitizers becomes the research focus for improving the photoelectric conversion efficiency of solar cells.

40|$|The {{traditional}} organic ruthenium dyes {{have some}} disadvantages, {{such as the}} routes of the synthesis of ligands being too time-consuming, the separation and purification of the ligands being difficult, the lower <b>photo-electric</b> <b>conversion</b> efficiency and so on. In view of these disadvantages, we designed and synthesized a new 9, 9 -[di-(2 -ethylhexane]- 4, 5 -diazafluorene ligand. Then we got the dye-sensitized solar cell using this ligand. Such ruthenium dye contains a kind of derivative of 4, 5 -diazafluorene ligand, and comparing with the traditional bipyridine ligands, the synthetic route is more simple and it’s suitable for large-scale practical application.
