40|$|The banking {{sector is}} under {{prudential}} regulations set internationally by the Basel Committee, {{in order to}} ensure its strength, stability and mitigate competitive inequities. Its founding principle is based on a minimum solvency ratio introduced in 1988 {{in the form of the}} Cooke ratio, resulting in a harmonization of the rules of banking supervision governing the level of <b>own</b> <b>funds.</b> Basel II was introduced after the various financial crises of the 1990 s (the Mexican crisis of 1994, the Asian crisis, and the Brazilian and Argentinean crisis). Despite a series of reforms, Basel II has quickly shown its limitations with the 2007 crisis that has strongly impacted the financial markets and the world economy generally. In this context, the Basel Committee has developed within Basel III a number of requirements which aim at strengthening the resilience of the banking institutions and financial system. These adjustments will be applied to the three pillars already in place and relate to capital, liquidity and systemic risks. The new Basel provisions relating to the calculation of the numerator of the solvency ratio are declined according to the triptych: strengthening the quality of <b>prudential</b> eligible <b>own</b> <b>funds</b> instruments, increase of the statutory deductions provided by Basel II, and higher minimum thresholds of solvency ratios. Furthermore, a limitation of the lever, calculated from the balance sheet and elements of off-balance sheet based on non-weighted by the risks, will be introduced. The Basel III criteria entering into force between 2013 and 2018 constitute one of the major challenges to which the banking sector will face. The real impact of the Basel III reform will depend on the attitude of the banks that will have to change in their strategy, their cost structure and policy of remuneration of the shareholders. A reform which will have therefore an impact on the world economy ensuring as estimated by Governors and supervisors, stability and long term economic performance. This paper will present the main adjustments proposed by the Basel Committee...|$|R

More {{than three-quarters of}} mutual fund–owning households <b>owned</b> <b>funds</b> outside DC retirement plans. Eighty percent of those households <b>owned</b> <b>funds</b> purchased through a professional financial adviser. Reliance on advisers was similar across demographic and financial characteristics of households. Full-service brokers and independent financial planners were {{the most commonly used}} professional financial advisers. Fifty-five percent of households that <b>owned</b> mutual <b>funds</b> outside DC plans <b>owned</b> <b>funds</b> purchased through a full-service broker, and nearly half <b>owned</b> <b>funds</b> purchased through an independent financial planner.

40|$|The present {{article has}} as a reserch field theoretical, methodological and {{practical}} {{aspects of the}} <b>own</b> <b>funds,</b> {{taking into account the}} line-up attempts of the romanian banking system to the requirements of the European Union, materialised in the Basel Agreement. The objectives of the research theme, presented in this paper, are mainly oriented towards <b>own</b> <b>funds.</b> We also proposed the following secondary objectives: presenting the concept approaches concerning <b>own</b> <b>funds,</b> emphasysing the tipology of <b>own</b> <b>funds</b> and pointing out their purpose in the banking activity; presenting and analyse the evolution of the <b>own</b> <b>funds</b> in Romania, for a period of 8 years (2004 - 2011). Even though the actual stage of the research in this field is advanced, in the romanian and foreign literature which dedicate a lot of theoretical and empiric studies concerning <b>own</b> <b>funds.</b> In our study we will use a theoretical and a practical research. The theoretical research describes the laws, reglementations and rules of application in the banking field in our country. In the practical part we will use as a research method the quality-comparative analyse by presenting details regarding bank back-ups. Despite the global financial crisis, the Romanian banking system can be considered as stable as a whole, with levels of capitalization, solvency and liquidity in accordance with consistent with prudential requirements. Tier 1, defined as the core of their sources of credit institutions through the permanent criteria, payment flexibility and capacity to absorb losses continued to overwhelmingly support a total equity. Appropriate quality of <b>own</b> <b>funds</b> is on their structure. The most important component frame our capital plus capital frame attached. The second component in terms is still represented by legal reserves. An important challenge for banks was to maintain a level of <b>own</b> <b>funds</b> accordance, in the conditions witch they were eroded by the current period losses. Tier 2 support rate of about 20 percentages of total equity and subordinated debt were the main components and revaluation reserves. Re-evaluation reserves have preserved funding contributions to Tier 2. An for evaluation of the level of capitalization of credit institutions, the central bank uses solvable indicator, as the only indicator currently regulated for this purpose. It also provides banks in Romania at the conditions for additional capital requirements related to Basel III framework to be taken by the European regulatory Capital Requirement Directive IV. As a final conclusion of the research in the <b>own</b> <b>funds</b> field we want to mention and express our opinion that the methods and techniques of managing risk, calculation of capital need permanent revision and adaptation to the changes that take place on the financial market the appearance of Basel Agreement 3, which are absolutely necessary in the actual economic and financial context. The presentation of concrete cases concerning the bank back-ups represent the personal work which completes the study concerning the analysis of managing banking risks, the role of bank back-ups in the bank capital adequacy mechanism...|$|R
