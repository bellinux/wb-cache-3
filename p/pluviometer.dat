Residents of the area voluntarily participated in collection of the rainfall data in the years 2007 and 2008; the residents were trained to collect the data before the <b>pluviometers</b> were installed. ArcGis 9. 2 software was used to outline and calculate the area of the Thiessen polygons, and both arithmetic and Thiessen precipitation means were calculated using Excel software. The average precipitation values were 1, 428 mm and 1, 450 mm, as calculated using the arithmetic mean and Thiessen method, respectively. Using data from the Agência Nacional de Águas (ANA), the rainfall and flow rate in the basin were calculated for the period from 1998 to 2005. The seasonality of precipitation is reflected in the temporary flow rate activity, which reached a peak of 1, 276. 9 m³/s during the flood period and 4. 1 m³/s during periods of the dry season. This behavior is fundamentally related to natural and social aspects of the basin, such as the occurrence of a hydrographic network with characteristics of a headwater associated with a hydrological regime marked by high seasonality; the low permeability of the soils in the basin; and the intensification of deforestation in the region in order to develop livestock as a privileged form of land use...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT – The {{interception}} of the rainfall by {{the forest}} canopy has great relevance to the nutrient geochemistry cycle in low fertility tropical soils under native or cultivated forests. However, {{little is known about}} the modification of the rainfall water quality and hydrological balance after interception by the canopies of eucalyptus under pure and mixed plantations with leguminous species, in Brazil. Samples of rainfall (RF), throughfall (TF) and stemflow (SF) were collected and analyzed in pure plantations of mangium (nitrogen fixing tree-NFT), guachapele (NFT) and eucalyptus (non-nitrogen fixing tree –NNFT) and in a mixed stand of guachapele and eucalyptus in Seropédica, State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Nine stemflow collectors (in selected trees) and nine <b>pluviometers</b> were randomly disposed under each stand and three <b>pluviometers</b> were used to measure the incident rainfall during 5. 5 months. Mangium conveyed 33. 4 % of the total rainfall for its stem. An estimative based on corrections for the average annual precipitation (1213 mm) indicated that the rainfall’s contribution to the nutrient input (kg ha- 1) was about 8. 42; 0. 95; 19. 04; 6. 74; 4. 72 and 8. 71 kg ha- 1 of N-NH 4 +, P, K+, Ca+ 2, Mg+ 2 and Na+, respectively. Throughfall provided the largest contributions compared to the stemflow nutrient input. The largest inputs of N-NH 4 + (15. 03 kg ha- 1) and K+ (179. 43 kg ha- 1) were observed under the guachapele crown. Large amounts of Na+ denote a high influence of the sea. Mangium was the most adapted species to water competitiveness. Comparatively to pure stand of eucalyptus, the mixed plantation intensifies the N, Ca and Mg leaching by the canopy, while the inputs of K and P were lower under these plantations...|$|R

Based on this research, an Alarm System of Sirens, together with a Monitoring System of Rain (<b>pluviometers),</b> was installed in 103 communities. At the Rio Operations Center a team of meteorologists work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, doing rain forecast and monitoring. A Meteorological Radar reaching 250 km makes the forecast and 83 <b>pluviometers</b> installed at the communities monitor the rain. If the rain reaches a critical level, what can cause accidents, the sirens are activated to warn the population {{about the risk of}} sliding and residents are oriented to move to safer places. The Municipal Civil Defense has identified places which can temporarily shelter these residents in the period of heavy rains. Therefore, indoor courts, residents’ associations, churches, schools and other establishments located at or near the communities, are the support points for receiving these residents. Several Simulated Evacuation Exercises have been organized to train and adapt, in a concrete way and as close to reality as possible, the residents of the areas at risk for their evacuation in an emergency situation. These trainings are also a great opportunity of exercising and evaluating the work of the people involved in the activation of sirens and opening of the support points, as well as stimulating the participation of volunteers and increasing the risk perception of the residents. This way, and complementing with integrated, fast and efficient actions of answer and reconstruction, the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro can become a Resilient City, to the heavy rains and to {{the disaster}}s, and therewith, gain capacity to face, adapt and absorb the impacts of these types of occurrences and restore the normality as soon as it is possible...|$|R

Study focusThe oxygen isotope {{composition}} from 266 <b>pluviometers</b> {{was used}} to study the spatial variability of δ 18 O and its relationship with Italian orography. The local meteoric water lines (LMWLs) of northern, southern and central Italy and Sicily are reformulated and a new definition of isotopic variations with elevation is provided. New hydrological insights for the regionAltitude and, to a lesser extent, latitude are the main geographical factors affecting the isotopic signature of precipitation in Italy. A high-resolution map of the spatial distribution of 18 O content in precipitation was created using the identified relationship between δ 18 O/Latitude-Altitude and the spatial distribution of the residuals. The general features of the δ 18 O distribution map may be summarised as follows: δ 18 O distribution over the Alps clearly depends on latitude and altitude, whereas over the Apennines, which run down the whole peninsula from north-west to south-east, it is more affected by altitude, the contour lines roughly following the axis of the chain.

40|$|Forest {{cover is}} of great {{importance}} {{in the context of}} water balance and may alter the mechanism of water absorption into the soil surface. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the throughfall, stemflow, and surface runoff compared to rainfall in a fragment of the Atlantic Rainforest. Rainfall was measured through a rain gauge and a pluviograph installed on a tower above the forest canopy. To quantify the throughfall, six plots of 20 x 20 m were laid, with 25 <b>pluviometers</b> five meters spaced from each other, for each plot. To measure the stemflow, collectors were adapted on the tree trunks having ≥ 15 cm circumference. For the runoff estimate, three plots were established with areas of 13. 71 m², 14. 79 m² and 14. 86 m². The plots were demarcated with galvanized iron sheets. Based on the results, it can be concluded that forests play an important role in the hydrological cycle: from the total precipitation (1182. 6 mm), one portion is intercepted by the tree canopy and evaporated back into the atmosphere; another portion (958. 1 mm) corresponding to 81 % of the total precipitation, passes through the canopy and hits the ground. The stemflow was 10. 8 mm, corresponding to 0. 9 % of the total rainfall. The runoff was 15. 5 mm, which corresponds to 1. 3 % of the rainfall. The vegetation has an important role in reducing the runoff volume on the soil surface...|$|R

40|$|The debris {{deposits}} at {{the bottom}} of very steep natural channels and streams in high mountain areas can be mobilized by runoff, triggering a water–sediment mixture flow known as debris flow. The routing of debris flow through human settlements can cause damage to civil structures and loss of human lives. The prediction of such an event, or the runoff discharge that triggers it, assumes an interest in risk analyses and the planning of defence measures. The object {{of this study is to}} find a method to determine the critical runoff value that triggers debris flow as a result of channel-bed failure. Historical and rainfall data on 30 debris flows that occurred in six watersheds of the Dolomites (north-eastern Italian Alps) were collected from different sources. Field investigations at the six sites, together with the hydrologic response to the rainfalls that triggered the events, were performed to obtain a realistic scenario of the formation of the debris flow there occurred. Field observations include a survey along the channel of the triggering reach of debris flow, with measurements of the channel slope and cross-section and sampling of debris deposits for grain size distribution. Simulated runoff discharge values based on the rainfall recorded by <b>pluviometers</b> were then compared with values obtained through experimental criteria on the initiation and formation of debris flow by bed failure.

40|$|In {{the last}} decades, several {{approaches}} were proposed accounting for early warning systems to manage {{in real time}} the risks due to fast slope failures where important elements, such as structures, infrastructures and cultural heritage are exposed. The challenge of these approaches is to forecast the slope evolution, thus providing alert levels suitable for managing infrastructures in order to mitigate the landslide risk and reduce the “response” time for interventions. Two different strategies can be defined in this regard: an observation-based approach (OBA) and a process-based approach (PBA), this last one comprehensive of semiempirical approaches (SEA) and a statistical-based one (SBA). At this aim, some experiments are being performed at different scales {{in the framework of}} technical applications, consulting activities and research projects managed by the Research Centre for the Geological Risk (CERI) of the University of Rome “Sapienza”.

40|$|International audienceRegarding isotopic hydrogeology, one {{important}} step for characterizing an aquifer {{is to compare}} the stable isotope signature of local rainwater with that of groundwater, which should reflect the mean weighted value of recharge by the successive rain events. Thus, considering that rainwater constitutes the main input into a hydrogeological system, {{the knowledge of the}} spatial variability of rainwater isotopic composition appears to be essential for hydrogeological investigations as well as for achieving sustainable water management. Five stations over France were monitored monthly for the δ 18 O and δ 2 H atmospheric signal (Brest, Dax, Orléans, Avignon and Thonon). They constitute the French monitoring network {{which is part of the}} IAEA/IOW Global Network for Isotopes in Précipitation (GNIP; [URL] and log to WISER) for isotopes of the water molecule. Other rain data originate from the BDISO databank, gathering isotopic data available on French groundwaters, surface waters and rainwater ([URL] They often represent only a few months of monitoring and do not refer to the same periods, as they stem from dedicated studies of local aquifers by the five French laboratories involved in BDISO (BRGM in Orléans, University of Paris-Sud in Orsay, University of Avignon, Centre de Recherches Géodynamiques in Thonon-les-Bains and CEA in Saclay). Among the available data, data points were selected applying the following criteria: (1) at least one year of monitoring should be avaliable, (2) isotopic data should be associated to the rain amount, (3) when two points are close, only the longest and more recent series of measurements are chosen. A total of 44 rain chronicles were selected. Some regions are poorly documented and complementary data were gathered: (1) lakes, that can be considered as natural <b>pluviometers</b> under specific conditions (upper part of watershed to limit runoff, pristine environment), are used after correction for evaporation, (2) young groundwaters were used as they often represent long term rainfall reasonably well, (3) landsnail shells integrating over the lifetime of the animal. Finally, to better constrain the isotopic signature near the borders of the French territory, we selected some data from the bibliography or long term rain monitoring in the GNIP database in the neighboring countries. The contour maps of δ 18 O and δ 2 H values reflect well the main effects that are known to affect the isotopic signature of precipitations; the continental and altitude effects are clearly visible. These maps constitute unique tools to assess the stable isotopic signature of oxygen and hydrogen in aquifer recharge. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that frequently rainwater data are used which integrate only over one year of precipitations and it was evidenced that the mean annual weighted δ 18 O values may vary by 1 to 2 ‰.

Para as bactérias, o óleo essencial da planta cultivada em canteiro único apresentou alta atividade frente ao Sthaphylococcus aureus (0, 08 mg/mL), e foi inativo para as demais bactérias. The {{essential}} oil {{of the plant}} Cymbopogon citratus, cultivated separately, and also joined with Achillea millefolium L, was obtained {{by the process of}} steam distillation. The oil yield was determined through seasonal variation, having as main parameters the temperature, the <b>pluviometer</b> indexes and the collection time. The best results were obtained in the morning period, during high-temperature-days presenting high <b>pluviometer</b> indexes. The microbiological analysis of Cymbopogon citratus {{essential oil}} against leavenings (Candida albicans and C. tropicalis), and against bacteria (Escherichia coli, Sthaphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) was determined by micro-dilution in broth (MIC). The essential oils cultivated separately, and joined with Achillea millefolium L., presented moderate activity in relation to the tested yeasts (0. 63 - 1. 25 mg/mL- 1). Regarding bacteria, the essential oil of the plant cultivated separately presented high activity in relation to Sthaphylococcus aureus (0. 08 mg/mL). On the other hand, the oil revealed to be inactive against other bacteria...|$|E
40|$|In this {{research}} the indices EI 30, AIm,‎ KE> 1 ‎ {{as well as}} P/√t‎ were determined for 16 pluviograph {{as well as for}} 3 Namak Lake Basin nearby stations. Regression relationships were established between the dependent variables of EI 30, AIm, KE> 1 ‎ as well as P/√t‎ Indices and other easily accessible rainfall indices of: fournier, modified fournier, maximum monthly rainfall, maximum daily rainfall, standard deviation of monthly and annual rainfall as well as <b>pluviometer</b> site elevations. This made the establishment of appropriate relationships between rainfall intensity dependent indices and the dependent variable of rainfall intensity (at stations where intensity was non-existent) possible. In the next step, the indices as well as easily accessible rainfall data from pluviograph stations were exploited to find out EI 30,AIm,‎ KE> 1 ‎ as well as P/√t‎ indices, while using the previously obtained regression relationships...|$|E
40|$|Phytoplankton composition, biomass {{and ecology}} were studied from samples {{bimonthly}} collected from December/ 1989 to October/ 1990 at Guajará Bay-Pará (Brazil). Analysis {{was based on}} plankton samples collected with a 65 µm mesh net, horizontal-surface hauled. Biomass was calculated by Utermohl method (cell/liter) and chlorophyll 'a' concentration. Water salinity, temperature, transparence and pH were measured for composition. Phytoplankton was composed of 116 specific and infraspecific taxa: 1 Cyanophyceae, 45 Chlorophyceae and 70 Bacillariophyceae. Most significatives were Polymyxus coronalis, amazonic brackishwater indicator. Quantitatively phytoplankton varied from 790000 cel/l to 4790000 cel/l, being phytoflagellate the most abundant followed by diatoms, blue green and green algae. Chlorophyll 'a' varied from 1. 49 mg/m 3 to 23. 33 mg/m 3. Guajará Bay water is characterized by small salinity variation, high temperature, law transparence and pH generally acid. These parameters annual variation is related to <b>pluviometer</b> regime that influences the phytoplankton quantitative values...|$|E
