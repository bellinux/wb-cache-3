25|$|While the English {{wine market}} was lucrative, the {{relationship}} was essentially monopolistic with {{the vast majority of}} control {{in the hands of the}} English wine merchants. Portuguese growers and wine producers had little other avenues for trade with other countries and thus prices were largely dictated by the English. The 1703 Metheun Treaty further promoted English interest in <b>Portuguese</b> <b>wines.</b> The treaty established a system of preferential tariffs for Portuguese wine, at the expense of wines from other countries. It specifies that the tariffs for Portuguese wine should never be more than two-thirds that of which was levied on French wines. At the time, the levy on French wines were roughly equivalent to £20 a barrel with the levies on <b>Portuguese</b> <b>wines</b> dropping to around £7 a barrel. By 1717, <b>Portuguese</b> <b>wines</b> accounted for more than 66% of all wine imported into England, while French wines imports shrank to a mere 4%.|$|E
25|$|<b>Portuguese</b> <b>wines</b> {{were first}} shipped to England in the 12th century from the Entre Douro e Minho region (which today {{includes}} modern Portuguese wine regions {{such as the}} douro and vinho verde). In 1386, Portugal and England signed the Treaty of Windsor which fostered close diplomatic {{relations between the two}} countries and opened the door for extensive trade opportunities. The 1703 Methuen Treaty furthered advanced English economic interest in Portugal by reducing tariffs and giving <b>Portuguese</b> <b>wines</b> preferential treatment in the British wine market over French wines. Around this time, the fortified wine known as port was increasing in popularity in Britain. The lucrative trade in Port prompted the Portuguese authorities to establish one of the world's first protected designation of origin when Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, Marquis of Pombal established boundaries and regulations for the production of authentic Port from the Douro in 1756.|$|E
25|$|In 1386, the Portuguese and English {{signed the}} Treaty of Windsor. The pact of mutual support fostered a strong {{diplomatic}} {{alliance between the}} two countries (and was still valid and applicable as of 2009). Over the ensuing centuries, whenever England was in conflict with other European powers (most notably France), Portugal and its many vineyards were there to fill in the gap caused by the disruption of trade. Portuguese wine also served as a bargaining chip in English politics. In 1679, the English Parliament banned all imports of French wine as a means of limiting the tariff income of Charles II and forcing him to come to Parliament and ask them directly for funds. Charles and the English wine merchants turned again to Portugal, dramatically increasing imports of <b>Portuguese</b> <b>wines</b> from 427 tuns in 1678 to averaging over 14,000 tuns (roughly equivalent to 16 million liters or over 4million US gallons) a year by 1685. However, it is very likely that not all these imported tuns were truly <b>Portuguese</b> <b>wines,</b> as some wine merchants found their way around the French wine embargo by shipping their wares in Portuguese wine barrels with forged documentation.|$|E

25|$|As the British market waned, <b>Portuguese</b> <b>wine</b> {{producers}} {{turned their}} attention the Portuguese colonies of West Africa and South America. Wanting {{to protect their own}} interest, the Portuguese developed monopolistic policies that practically forbade their colonies from importing wines from other countries or trying to produce wine of their own. In Brazil, the wealthy market of Rio de Janeiro was given exclusively to the Douro producers {{at the expense of other}} <b>Portuguese</b> <b>wine</b> regions. The monopoly of control allowed <b>Portuguese</b> <b>wine</b> merchants to set excessively high prices on their wines, often five times the price that the wines would fetch in Britain or Portugal. Dissatisfaction over restrictions such as these contributed to the growing movement for Brazilian Declaration of Independence which was eventually achieved on 7 September 1822. With the loss of the Brazilian market and the limited markets in West Africa, <b>Portuguese</b> <b>wine</b> producers retreated further into their relative isolationism when it came to the wine market. While Britain still remained a strong market, the <b>Portuguese</b> <b>wine</b> industry entered a period of stagnation that was further punctuated by the devastation of the phylloxera louse.|$|R
25|$|During this period, {{fortified}} <b>Portuguese</b> <b>wines</b> such as Port and Madeira were {{increasing in}} {{popularity in the}} English/British market. In the Atlantic, the Portuguese controlled island of Madeira was a vital trading stop to British colonies in the New World and beyond. The process of fortification was discovered to enhance the flavor and stability of wines on these long sea voyages. Madeira wine became particularly popular in the American colonies, with an established market that continued to thrive even after the colonies gained independence from Great Britain.|$|E
25|$|Portugal is {{a country}} of wine lovers and winemakers, known since the Roman Empire-era; the Romans {{immediately}} associated Portugal with its God of Wine Bacchus. Today, many <b>Portuguese</b> <b>wines</b> are known {{as some of the}} world's best: Vinho do Douro, Vinho do Alentejo, Vinho do Dão, Vinho Verde, Rosé and the sweet: Port wine (Vinho do Porto, literally Porto's wine), Madeira wine, Muscatel of Setúbal, and Moscatel of Favaios. Beer is also widely consumed, with the largest national beer brands being Sagres and Super Bock. Liqueurs, like Licor Beirão and ginjinha, are popular.|$|E
25|$|For centuries afterwards, <b>Portuguese</b> <b>wines</b> {{came to be}} {{associated}} with Port (and to some extent Madeira which was a popular drink of British colonies around the globe, such as the American colonies.) In the mid-to-late 20th century, sweet, slightly sparkling rosé brands from Portugal (Mateus and Lancers being the most notable) became immensely popular around the globe-with the British wine market again leading the way. In the mid-1980s, Portugal's introduction to the European Union brought a flood of financing and grants to the stagnant Portuguese wine industry. These new investments paved the way for upgrades in winemaking technology and facilities. Renewed interest in the abundance of unique Portuguese wine grape varieties shifted focus to more premium wine production with a portfolio of unique dry red and white wines being marketed on a global scale.|$|E
40|$|Mestrado em Viticultura e Enologia - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaThe United States of America is the world’s biggest {{economy and}} one of the most {{important}} consumers and importers of wine in the world. Although the exports of <b>Portuguese</b> <b>wine</b> have been increasing in the recent years, there has been a generalized over-production. For these reasons, the question was raised: why isn’t the <b>Portuguese</b> <b>wine</b> more exported to the US market? Based on these evidences and trying to find answers for the above question, this work (1) analysed the grape and wine production in the world and, in a more specific way, in Portugal and the USA; (2) verified the context of the world, <b>Portuguese</b> and US <b>wine</b> consumption; (3) studied the <b>Portuguese</b> <b>wine</b> exports, specially to the USA; (4) characterized the US wine industry and how it works and (5) analysed the US consumer and his/her wine consumption habits and preferences. It was possible to understand the ways and solutions followed by the international and Portuguese successful cases in the US wine market. Based on this and on the potential of <b>Portuguese</b> <b>wine,</b> some possible strategies were presented targeting wine producers and the several agents of the <b>Portuguese</b> <b>wine</b> industry in order to increase wine exports to the USA...|$|R

25|$|Since the 17th century, British wine merchants {{had been}} {{consolidating}} their {{power over the}} Portuguese wine trade—particularly in the Douro region, which produced the style of wine that included some addition of brandy, which was becoming popular in the London market. The 1703 Methuen Treaty between England and Portugal had both direct and indirect effects on the Portuguese wine industry. The treaty not only stipulated {{that the amount of}} duties on <b>Portuguese</b> <b>wines</b> was to never be more than two-thirds that of which was levied on French wines, it also allowed English woolen cloth to be admitted into Portugal free of duty. This second stipulation ended up having a devastating effect on the Portuguese textile industry, leading to huge numbers of shepherds and weavers becoming unemployed. In and around the Douro region, this segment of labor turned to the wine industry and encouraged a boom in vineyard planting. Over the next few decades the resulting grape surplus, coupled with some unscrupulous examples of wine fraud and adulteration, led to a general decline in Port quality and a depression in prices.|$|E

Prior to this, non-fortified <b>Portuguese</b> <b>wines</b> were characterized as being [...] "rustic" [...] and [...] "oxidized". Advancements in better winemaking techniques have allowed producers to make cleaner, softer wines that are more palatable to the international wine market. While historically the Portuguese wine industry was seemingly split into two: the producers who made Port and those who made everything else, {{the distinction between the}} two sides of the industry is now blurred. Many Port producers are now making premium dry wines from grapes grown in the Douro and producers in other areas of Portugal have been experimenting with making fortified wine in the style of Port (though it can not legally be called Port). In recent times, producers have been focusing more experimenting with the abundance of unique Portuguese grape varieties as well as international varieties. Wines from Portuguese regions such as Dão, Vinho Verde and Alentejo have been exported around the globe and garnered attention from wine critics.|$|E

60|$|An {{exposition}} of mercantilism {{would not be}} complete without a statement of the form it assumed in France {{under the guidance of}} Colbert,(14) the great minister of Louis XIV, from 1661 to 1683. In order to create a favorable balance of trade, he devoted himself to fostering home productions, by attempts to abolish vexatious tolls and customs within the country, and by an extraordinary system of supervision in manufacturing establishments (which has been the stimulus to paternal government from which France has never since been able to free herself). Processes were borrowed from England, Germany, and Sweden, and new establishments for making tapestries and silk goods sprang up; even the sizes of fabrics were regulated by Colbert, and looms unsuitable for these sizes destroyed. In 1671 wool-dyers were given a code of detailed instructions as to the processes and materials that might be used. Long after, French industry felt the difficulty of struggling with stereotyped processes. His system, however, naturally resulted in a series of tariff measures (in 1664 and 1667). Moderate duties on the exportation of raw materials were first laid on, followed by heavy customs imposed on the importation of foreign goods. The shipment of coin was forbidden; but Colbert’s criterion of prosperity was the favorable balance of trade. French agriculture was overlooked. The tariff of 1667 was based on the theory that foreigners must of necessity buy French wines, lace, and wheat; that the French could sell, but not buy; but the act of 1667 cut off the demand for French goods, and <b>Portuguese</b> <b>wines</b> came into the market. England and Holland retaliated and shut off the foreign markets from France. The wine and wheat growers of the latter country were ruined, and the rural population came to the verge of starvation. Colbert’s last years were full of misfortune and disappointment; and a new illustration was given of the fallacy that the gain from international trade was not mutual.|$|E

While the rise of co-operatives brought more order and structure to the <b>Portuguese</b> <b>wine</b> industry, it also had the negative effect of curbing creativity and free enterprise. As co-operatives rose to nearly absolute power in several wine regions, the winemaking and hygiene standards of some of the more lax co-operatives declined, which cast a pale reputation on the whole of the <b>Portuguese</b> <b>wine</b> industry. The lone bright spot during this period was the international success of a style of mass-produced, sweet, slightly sparkling rosés that came out of Portugal. Following World War II, brands such as Mateus and Lancer marketed this style of wine to great success in British supermarkets and around the globe. Outside port, these wines also came to be readily associated with <b>Portuguese</b> <b>wine.</b>|$|R
