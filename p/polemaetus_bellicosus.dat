50|$|Although the crowned eagle's long tail imparts {{an overall}} length up to 90 cm, it is {{somewhat}} less massive and has a considerably shorter wingspan than Africa's largest eagle, the martial eagle (<b>Polemaetus</b> <b>bellicosus).</b> It is nevertheless considered Africa's most powerful eagle when {{measured in terms of}} the weight of its prey items. It often preys on mammals such as bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus), exceptionally weighing up to 30 kg albeit usually much less. The crowned eagle possesses unusually large talons and strong legs, and may kill by crushing the skull. The eagle is also ferocious; some records from beneath a nest show the remains of a large, male Sooty mangabey weighing 11 kg.|$|E

50|$|The {{martial eagle}} (<b>Polemaetus</b> <b>bellicosus)</b> {{is a large}} eagle native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is {{the only member of}} the genus Polemaetus. A species of the booted eagle {{sub-family}} (Aquillinae), it has feathering over its tarsus. One of the largest and most powerful species of booted eagle, it is a fairly opportunistic predator that varies it prey selection between mammals, birds and reptiles. Its hunting technique is unique as it is one of few eagle species known to hunt primarily from a high soar, by stooping on its quarry. An inhabitant of wooded belts of otherwise open savanna, this species has shown a precipitous drop in the last few centuries due to a variety of factors. The martial eagle is one of the most persecuted bird species in the world. Due to its habit of taking livestock and regionally valuable game, local farmers and game wardens frequently seek to eliminate martial eagles, although the effect of eagles on this prey is almost certainly considerably exaggerated. Currently, the martial eagle is classified with the status of Vulnerable to extinction by the IUCN.|$|E
5000|$|Most accipitrids usually hunt prey rather {{smaller than}} themselves. However, many accipitrids {{of almost all}} sizes have been {{recorded}} as capturing and then flying with prey of equal weight or even slightly heavier than themselves in their talons, a feat that requires great physical strength. Occasionally, an eagle or other raptor that kills prey considerably heavier than itself (too heavy for the raptor to carry and fly with) will then have to leave prey where they've killed and later return repeatedly to feed or dismember {{and bring to a}} perch or nest piece by piece. This has the advantage of providing a surplus of food but has the disadvantage of potentially attracting scavengers or other predators which can steal the kill or even attack the feeding accipitrid. Using this method, accipitrids such as the golden (Aquila chrysaetos), wedge-tailed (Aquila rapax), martial (<b>Polemaetus</b> <b>bellicosus)</b> and crowned eagles (Stephanoaetus coronatus) have successfully hunted ungulates, such as deer and antelope, and other large mammals (kangaroos and emus in the wedge-tailed) weighing more than 30 kg (66 lb), 7-8 times their own mass. More typical prey for these powerful booted eagle species weigh between 0.5 and 5 kg.|$|E
50|$|Being a large, ground-dwelling bird species, the {{kori bustard}} is {{vulnerable}} to many of Africa's myriad of formidable terrestrial predators. Leopards (Panthera pardus), caracals (Caracal caracal), cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus), lions (Panthera leo), spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta), African rock pythons (Python sebae), jackals (Canis spp.), Verreaux's eagle (Aquila verreauxii), martial eagles (<b>Polemaetus</b> <b>bellicosus),</b> and Verreaux's eagle-owls (Bubo lacteus) are amongst their potential natural predators. Additionally, warthogs (Phacochoerus spp.), tawny eagles (Aquila rapax), Cape eagle-owls (Bubo capensis), mongooses and baboons (Papio spp.) may eat eggs, small chicks, {{and in the case}} of the tawny eagle and the Cape eagle-owl sometimes adults. When alarmed, kori bustards make barking calls and bend forward and spread their tail and wings to appear larger. Adults will growl when their young are threatened by predators. Chicks tend to be the most vulnerable to predators by far. Many, despite their cryptic camouflage and the mother's defenses, are regularly picked off by jackals and leopards at night. Up to 82% of kori bustard chicks die in their first year of life. When found with carmine bee-eaters, the smaller birds may incidentally provide some protection from predators due to their vigilance. The display of the adult male may make it more conspicuous to larger predators, such as hyenas or lions. A shock display may be performed when a bird is alarmed. While too large to be prey for most predatory birds, it is known that the martial eagle is a serious natural enemy even for adult bustards. In one documented attack by a martial eagle on an adult kori bustard, both birds ended up wounded, the eagle with a bleeding leg from the bustard's counterattack, but the bustard more seriously injured, with a broken wing and several open wounds. Although it walked away, the injured bustard in the confrontation was found dead the next morning, being fed on by a jackal.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{than these}} rare cases, larger {{birds of prey}} such eagles are not usually harassed by Verreaux's eagle-owl and are more aptly viewed as competitors. In fact, the martial eagle (<b>Polemaetus</b> <b>bellicosus),</b> in most regards the largest eagle in Africa, is {{sometimes}} regarded as the diurnal ecological equivalent of the Verreaux's eagle-owl. The martial eagle has rather similar habitat preferences to the eagle-owl and has a similarly broad, opportunistic diet. At roughly 4200 g in average body mass, the martial eagle is roughly twice as heavy so Verreaux's eagle-owl and takes correspondingly large prey, its average prey weight range being 1000 to 5000 g and the eagles are capable of exceptionally taking prey up to nearly nine times their own weight, whereas quantitatively most of the eagle-owls prey does not exceed 1000 to 1500 g. Verreaux's eagle-owl are likely to give martial eagles a respectful amount of space during daytime {{and there are no}} records of the two species harassing one another. Another particularly large and aggressive eagle, the crowned eagle (Stephanoaetus coronatus), is largely a forest-dweller and so is less directly a diurnal equivalent. There a single recorded instance of an immature crowned eagle being aggressively displaced at night by an adult Verreaux's eagle-owl when it happen to encroach on the eagle-owl's territory but without bloodshed and eagle-owls would do well to avoid the exceptionally powerful eagle. Taken together, the Verreaux's, the Shelley's and the cape eagle-owls could be seen as nocturnally replacing the eagle species of martial, crowned and Verreaux's eagles in the respective habitats of savanna, forest and rocky areas but their increasingly diminishing size in comparison to the diurnal eagles means that, generally speaking, less large-bodied prey is likely to be attacked. [...] Despite its place {{near the top of the}} nocturnal avian food chain, in 2013 a remote wildlife camera videotaped a black-backed jackal (Canis mesomelas) attacking and killing a Verreaux's eagle owl at a watering hole. Similar rare successful attacks on great horned owls and Eurasian eagle-owls by smaller red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) have been reported but in these cases the owls were mysteriously grounded in the horned owl and distracted by nesting into too-easily accessed sea cliffs in the eagle-owl. More often foxes are prey rather than predators for northern Bubo owls. Given that the Verreaux's eagle-owl is surprisingly bold about coming to their ground to, among other things capture beetles, feed on prey too large to carry in flight or, as is likely the case in the jackal attack, drink water, it is possible that the jackal was simply able to ambush an incautious eagle-owl rather than a grounded one.|$|E

30|$|Although {{only the}} list for herpetofauna (except for serpentoid reptiles) could be {{considered}} fairly complete, {{the results indicate that}} the Kamdebooberge has a rich and varied faunal diversity. Among amphibians, Amietophrynus rangeri (Raucous Toad) and Strongylopus grayii (Clicking Stream Frog) are southern African endemics (Minter et al. 2004). Out of the five species of reptiles recorded, two are of high conservation importance. The Afroedura karroica (Karoo Flat Gecko) is endemic to the Sneeuberg range and its immediate surroundings, while Cordylus cordylus (Cape Girdled Lizard) is an Eastern Cape and Western Cape endemic. Pseudocordylus microlepidotus (Cape Crag Lizard) and Trachylepis homalocephala (Red-sided Skink are southern African endemics (Branch 1998). Among the birds recorded, Macronyx capensis (Orange-throated Longclaw) and Serinus canicollis (Cape Canary) are southern African endemics (Hockey et al. 2005). The importance of the Kamdebooberge for raptors-especially as a possible nesting site is evident, particularly for rugged terrain species such as Aquila verreauxii (Verreaux’s/Black Eagle), and from previous sightings of Aquila pennata (Booted Eagle) and <b>Polemaetus</b> <b>bellicosus</b> (Martial Eagle). From a conservation perspective the most important among recorded mammals is the South African endemic Pelea capreolus (Grey Rhebok), given its patchy montane distribution and its population stronghold in the Sneeuberg (Skinner and Chimimba 2005).|$|E
40|$|Understanding the ranging {{behaviours}} {{of species}} {{can be helpful}} in effective conservation planning. However, for many species that are rare, occur at low densities, or occupy challenging environments, this information is often lacking. The Martial Eagle (<b>Polemaetus</b> <b>bellicosus)</b> is a low density apex predator declining in both non-protected and protected areas in southern Africa, and little is known about its ranging behaviour. We use GPS tags fitted to Martial Eagles (n = 8) in Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa to describe their ranging behaviour and habitat preference. This represents the first time that such movements have been quantified in adult Martial Eagles. Territorial eagles (n = 6) held home ranges averaging ca. 108 km 2. Home range estimates were similar to expectations based on inter-nest distances, and these large home range sizes could constrain the carrying capacity of even the largest conservation areas. Two tagged individuals classed as adults on plumage apparently did not hold a territory, and accordingly ranged more widely (ca. 44, 000 km 2), and beyond KNP boundaries as floaters. Another two territorial individuals abandoned their territories and joined the 'floater' population, and so ranged widely after leaving their territories. These unexpected movements after territory abandonment could indicate underlying environmental degradation. Relatively high mortality of these wide-ranging 'floaters' due to anthropogenic causes (three of four) raises further concerns for the species' persistence. Habitat preference models suggested Martial Eagles used areas preferentially that were closer to rivers, had higher tree cover, and were classed as dense bush rather than open bush or grassland. These results can be used by conservation managers to help guide actions to preserve breeding Martial Eagles at an appropriate spatial scale...|$|E
40|$|The Martial Eagle (<b>Polemaetus</b> <b>bellicosus)</b> is an African endemic {{that occurs}} {{over a wide}} range of {{habitats}} but at naturally low densities. There is concern throughout its range that it is declining and it now appears to be strongly reliant on protected areas. It is classified globally as Near Threatened by the IUCN with a current consultation underway to up-list it to Vulnerable or Endangered. In this project I describe and explore the decline of the species across South Africa, using data from two repeated national bird surveys - South African Bird Atlas Projects (SABAP 1 : 1987 - 1993; SABAP 2 : 2007 - 2012). These analyses suggest a relatively uniform decline across South Africa in Martial Eagle reporting rates of 59 % over the last 20 years. Alarmingly, these declines also occurred in protected areas, including the traditional strongholds of the Kruger National Park (54 % decline) and the Kalahari National Park (44 % decline). Independent survey data, undertaken in the Kalahari National Park, confirmed these declines and reinforced the validity of using the two SABAP surveys to examine population change. Within protected areas, the species is still encountered five times more frequently and is six times as abundant as compared to outside protected areas. Between the biomes, the species is encountered the least and has the lowest abundance in the Grassland biome where tree density is low, and has the highest abundance in the Savanna biome where tree density is higher. Examining environmental correlates of these population changes provided some support for two hypotheses on the causes of these declines, with climate change (increases in temperature) and power line densities negatively associated with changes in reporting rates. Although this analysis also suggested support for declines being associated with avian prey declines, this was unlikely to be a major driver nationally, because I found that overall avian prey species actually increased over this time period. Within Kruger National Park changes in reporting rates were negatively associated with Elephant densities, which may be related to a reduction in nesting opportunities (large trees) for the species. These results are an initial attempt to assess the broad drivers of decline and should help focus and prioritize further detailed research to elucidate the mechanisms behind this species decline...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesMany large, sparsely {{distributed}} raptors {{are threatened}} {{by a host of}} anthropogenic factors, while a minority may actually benefit from some aspects of development and environmental change. Clarity on the size and trajectory of such populations is essential for effective conservation management, but can be difficult to achieve. One solution is to use multivariate habitat association models to derive critical estimates of distribution and abundance. The South African population of Martial Eagle <b>Polemaetus</b> <b>bellicosus</b> is currently estimated at < 800 adult birds, with the bulk of the known population believed to be residing in the larger protected areas. However, Martial Eagles also build nests on pylons that support high voltage transmission lines running through the largely treeless, semiarid landscapes of the Karoo. The main aim {{of this study was to}} develop a better understanding of the environmental factors that influence Martial Eagle territory densities and locations along South African transmission lines, and thereby estimate the size of this population and its relative importance to the national conservation status of this globally threatened species. I used habitat association models to d escribe Martial Eagle territory density in relation to eight environmental covariates. Models were first fitted to eagle territory data for the central Karoo regions, collected and pooled over the period 2002 - 2006, and then applied to predict the number of pairs present on each of three adjacent sections of unsurveyed line (northern, southern and eastern lines). Once these model predictions were verified by a series of aerial and ground surveys, I fitted the models to all the known Martial Eagle territory records for the transmission network and extrapolated from these back to the rest of the network using the fitted relationships. Ultimately, the models predicted 52 additional Martial Eagle territories on the remaining transmission network with a confidence interval ranging from 38 to 67 (based on models that explained up to 39 % of the total variance in terms of only two explanatory terms – rainfall and the proportion of cultivated land). I then examined the role of territoriality and social structure in the eagle population in determining the location and dispersion of pylon nests. To do this I used the location of active nests from the original central Karoo data and a similar number of randomly selected points. I then asked whether I could predict the nest locations from each of the eight environmental covariates and distance to its nearest conspecific active nest or its nearest nest of any other large eagle species. Using a logistic generalised linear model with regression splines for distance to nearest other nest, I found that Martial Eagles strongly avoid proximity to conspecific nests (mean distance to conspecific nest = 28. 2 km, range 2. 5 - 167. 1 km, n = 306). This result shows that minimum spacing should be considered in predicting the distribution of eagles on unsurveyed transmission lines. Lastly, I further investigated the geographical extent of pylon nesting in South African Martial Eagles, with particular focus on variation in the frequency of this behaviour in relation to biome - scale variation in the availability of trees as natural nest sites. To do this, I related Martial Eagle reporting rates generated by citizen - science bird atlas data to the density of transmission lines and biome types across South Africa. While these analyses yielded some suggestive results, such as significant positive and negative relationships between reporting rates and line density in the Desert (P = 0. 02) versus the Savanna (P < 0. 001) biomes respectively, data sparseness in arid areas and a generally low detection probability limited the conclusiveness of these results. The refined habitat association models developed in this study predict that the South African transmission grid supports 130 - 159 breeding pairs of Martial Eagle. This figure has never been estimated or calculated before, and suggests that 36 % of the national breeding population could reside largely in the commercial ranchland and nest on man - made structures. This result, which is at odds with the generally held belief that the Martial Eagle is increasingly confined to large protected areas, has significant implications for the thinking around the conservation management of this globally threatened species...|$|E
