The private provision of drugs {{has been shown to}} be associated with irrational use of substandard drugs quality and non compliance to drug regulations. However, there is limited information regarding adherence to prescription requirements among pharmacy workers in Dar es Salaam region. The aim of the study was to determine factors influencing prescription adherence among pharmacy workers in Dar es Salaam region. A cross sectional study was conducted in July 2009 among 165 pharmacy workers in Dar es Salaam region. Questionnaires were administered to assess pharmacy worker's knowledge about <b>Prescription</b> <b>only</b> <b>Medicine</b> (PoM) also to find out how they would manage a client requesting antibiotics without a prescription. A simulated client method was administered in order to measure the pharmacy worker's behaviour. Of the 165 respondents interviewed, 87. 9 % were females and 57 % were in the age group of 20 - 29 years. In this study, we also had a total of 62 encounters as simulated clients among whom 72. 6 % were handled by female pharmacy workers. During interview, 92. 7 % of pharmacy workers reported that•they would request for a prescription before dispensing any antibiotics. However, in 62 simulations of a patient with diarrhea at home 87. 1 % (54 / 62) pharmacy workers did not ask for a prescription. Although among the 54 simulations a prescription was not requested, 88. 9 % of the pharmacy workers agreed to dispense antibiotics. In response to the question "What is the major factor that influences a pharmacy worker to dispense antibiotics without a prescription?

Methods A cross-sectional descriptive study involving {{the entire population of}} Malaysian community pharmacies (nÂ =Â  1419) was undertaken using a self-completed anonymous mail questionnaire. Results A total of 219 responses were received for a response rate of 15. 4 %. Majority of the respondents (93. 6 %) agreed that pharmacists should have generic substitution rights. Almost all pharmacists (96. 8 %) viewed Poison Class C (pharmacist <b>only</b> <b>medicine)</b> as most suitable class of controlled medicines for substitution.

40|$|Background: The {{introduction}} of Patient Group Directions (PGD) has changed significantly {{the way in}} which nurses can now administer <b>prescription</b> <b>only</b> <b>medicines</b> as a one-off for patients requiring this level of service. PGD’s are a written authority to administer drugs to patients that are not identified at the time of treatment. Aim: The aim of this project was to develop a PGD for use within an Outreach team to administer colloid boluses to patients presenting with hypovolemia. Method: Using a case exemplar this paper will discuss the development of a PGD using aspects of transitional change theory to highlight the potential barriers that were encountered. Implications for Practice: The implications for this PGD are wide reaching. First it now enables members from the nursing Outreach team to administer colloid fluid boluses to a prescribed patient cohort without the need for prescription. Second, it ensures the deteriorating patient has interventions initiated in a timely and appropriate manner to reduce inadvertent admission to high care areas. Last, it will improve inter-professional team-working and communication so much so that collaborative patient care reduces health costs and identifies earlier those patients requiring substantially greater nursing and medical input. Conclusion: The experience of developing a working PGD for fluid administration has meant that the Outreach team is able to respond to patients in a more effective way. In addition, it is the experience of developing this PGD that has enabled the team to contemplate other PGD’s in the execution of Outreach work...|$|R
