5|$|Alan Gordon <b>Partridge</b> is {{a fictional}} {{character}} portrayed by English actor and comedian Steve Coogan. A parody of British television personalities, <b>Partridge</b> is a tactless and inept {{television and radio}} presenter who often insults his guests and whose inflated sense of celebrity drives him to treachery and shameless self-promotion. Coogan described <b>Partridge</b> as a Little Englander, with right-wing values and poor taste.|$|E
5|$|<b>Partridge</b> {{was created}} by Coogan and Armando Iannucci for the 1991 BBC Radio 4 comedy {{programme}} On the Hour, a spoof of British current affairs broadcasting, as the show's sports presenter. In 1992, <b>Partridge</b> hosted a spin-off Radio 4 spoof chat show, Knowing Me, Knowing You with Alan <b>Partridge.</b> On the Hour transferred to television as The Day Today in 1994, followed by Knowing Me, Knowing You later that year. In 1997, Coogan starred as <b>Partridge</b> in a BBC sitcom, I'm Alan <b>Partridge,</b> written by Coogan, Iannucci and Peter Baynham, following Partridge's life working for a small radio station {{and living in a}} roadside hotel. It earned two BAFTAs and was followed by a second series in 2002.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, a spoof autobiography, , {{written by}} Coogan, Iannucci and the Gibbons brothers, was {{published}} in the UK.

In October, Coogan appeared as <b>Partridge</b> to promote the book on The Jonathan Ross Show and BBC Radio 5 Live. It received positive reviews and became a bestseller.|$|E

40|$|In Italy {{several small}} populations of red-legged <b>partridges</b> has been reconstituted {{in areas where}} the species was extinguished. In these areas release of {{different}} animals must be programmed, since the dimension of the reconstituted populations does not catch up the minimal dimension required to guard the species from a new extinction. We have thoght therefore indispensable to carry out a research in order to estimate the integration ability of the released raised <b>partridges</b> with the wild population, the survival rates, the use of the habitat and the home-ranges of both populations. In a protected areaf Central Italy 350 raised <b>partridges</b> were released during August month. In January 6 raised <b>partridges</b> and 21 wild <b>partridges</b> has been captured by traps. 6 subjects for each thesis (raised or wild) have been therefore equipped with radio necklaces and localised biweekly until July. No difference in mortality rates was observed between wild or raised <b>partridges</b> that had survived to the winter. Raised <b>partridges,</b> that survive after release in the wild, were able to integrate themselves in mixed brigades with the wild <b>partridges.</b> Vineyards with interlined grass were the habitat most frequented. The distance from the subsidiary artificial feeding points significantly increased during broods showing the necessity to increase the number and dispersion of the supplementary feeders in spring, to help the animals from an alimentary point of view. The distance from the houses and home range surfaces did not differ between wild and raised <b>partridges...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{survival}} rates of redlegged <b>partridges</b> artificially hatched and brooded (Incubator) or naturally hatched and brooded {{by their own}} parents in small flying pens (Parents), were evaluated in 28 radiotagged redlegged <b>partridges.</b> Results showed that all the <b>partridges</b> of the group Incubator deceased within 80 days after release and only 4 <b>partridges</b> (28. 5 %) of the group Parents were still alive after 100 days from their release in the wild.

40|$|The repopulations {{carried out}} with captive raised red-legged <b>partridges</b> don’t seem to conduct to {{satisfactory}} results. Currently, the <b>partridges</b> present to the free state in different Tuscany areas (obtained from captivity raised animals) are not yet able to reconstitute self sustaining wild populations. The presence of hybrids with non indigenous <b>partridges</b> (E. G. A. chukar) and the genetic/behavioural alterations, {{due to the traditional}} breeding, are presumably the principal causes of the insufficient quality of the reintroduced animals. For these reason we wanted to test the reproduction ability of the genetically pure red-legged <b>partridges</b> in controlled aviaries with the aim to produce <b>partridges</b> more fitted for wildlife release. 14 couples of red <b>partridges,</b> certified genetically not hybridized with A. chukar by theNational Institute for Wild Fauna, were used for the test. Only 6 couples brooded the laid eggs and only 3 couples of them completed the brooding, with the birth of 17 <b>partridges</b> in total. The study therefore has underlined the necessity to use the direct brooding for the selection of the reproducers of the game farms, with the aim to improve the natural reproductive ability of the captive raised animals...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Partridges</b> - Since Don Juan Manuel's Tales of Count Lucanor, <b>partridges</b> {{have served}} in Spanish {{literature}} as symbols of deceit. In El Conde Lucanor itself they mark a necromancer's deception of a clergyman wishing to advance his career within the church. The necromancer offers the clergyman a dinner of <b>partridges</b> and promptly hypnotizes him into believing he ascends to the papacy {{in a matter of}} a few years. Therefore, <b>partridges</b> in this story may symbolize Millán's untrustworthiness, or his weakness in the face of persuasion, as we observe that Millán betrays almost unwittingly with a slight nod of the head.|$|R

Henry Saunders was made keeper of {{a portion of}} the Downs at £30 a year under The Protectorate, as a reward for trying to seize a highwayman, and in 1668 a gamekeeper was appointed by the Duchy of Lancaster, at the same salary, to preserve hares and <b>partridges.</b> In 1669 the King (Charles II) was hawking there, it not being then the custom to shoot <b>partridges.</b>|$|R

50|$|Perdicinae is a {{subfamily}} {{of birds}} in the pheasant family, Phasianidae, regrouping the <b>partridges,</b> Old World quails, and francolins. Although this subfamily was considered monophyletic and separated from the pheasants, tragopans, junglefowls, and peafowls (Phasianinae) till the early 1990s, molecular phylogenies have shown that these two subfamilies actually constitute only one lineage. For example, some <b>partridges</b> (Perdix genus) are more closely affiliated to pheasants, whereas Old World quails and <b>partridges</b> from the Alectoris genus are closer to junglefowls.|$|R

5|$|Attempts to outflank the bunkers were {{answered}} with heavy fire from a Japanese medium machine gun {{and another man}} was killed and three more wounded. As the attack began to falter, one of the wounded, 20-year-old Private Frank <b>Partridge,</b> who had been injured in the arm and thigh, braved the heavy fire that was being put down towards him and gathered the Bren light machine gun from the gunner who had been killed. After pouring suppressing fire onto the bunker, he discarded the Bren and regathered his rifle, before rushing towards the bunker with a grenade and killing its occupants. Partridge's actions reinvigorated the attack and allowed the Australians to temporarily take the second Japanese position. After the wounded were recovered, the Australians withdrew having lost three men killed and five wounded. Against this eight Japanese were confirmed to have been killed. For his actions during the attack on 24 July, <b>Partridge</b> was awarded the Victoria Cross, the British Commonwealth's highest military decoration. He was the last Australian to be awarded the medal during the Second World War, and was also the youngest.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{late summer}} 2010 a {{mosquito}} born flavivirus not previously reported in Europe called Bagaza virus (BAGV) caused high mortality in red-legged <b>partridges</b> (Alectoris rufa) and ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus). We studied clinical findings, lesions and viral antigen distribution in naturally BAGV infected game birds {{in order to}} understand the apparently higher impact on red-legged <b>partridges.</b> The disease induced neurologic signs in the two galliform species and, to a lesser extent, in common wood pigeons (Columba palumbus). In red-legged <b>partridges</b> infection by BAGV caused severe haemosiderosis in the liver and spleen that was absent in pheasants and less evident in common wood pigeons. Also, BAGV antigen was present in vascular endothelium in multiple organs in red-legged <b>partridges,</b> and in the spleen in common wood pigeons, while in ring-necked pheasants it was only detected in neurons and glial cells in the brain. These findings indicate tropism of BAGV for endothelial cells and a severe haemolytic process in red-legged <b>partridges</b> in addition to the central nervous lesions that were found in all three species. </p...|$|R
