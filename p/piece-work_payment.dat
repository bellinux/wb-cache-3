40|$|Urinary {{levels of}} free {{adrenaline}} and noradrenaline were measured in {{two groups of}} healthy male industrial workers exposed to alternate four-day periods of working conditions with and without time stress, {{to test the hypothesis}} that the sympathetic nervous system is overactivated by occupational stress. Thirty confectionary workers alternated <b>piece-work</b> (<b>payment</b> by results) and work with a fixed daily wage while 30 metal workers alternated work on an assembly line with work off it. Under time stress urinary free adrenaline was 450 per cent and noradrenaline 230 per cent of the levels for similar work without time stress but involving equal oxygen consumption. These differences were statistically highly significant and they persisted on retesting after six months of alternating work regimens. They support the concept that occupational stress in industrial workers influences the adrenosympathetic system and they indicate a possible method for assessing the effects of high levels of sympathetic activity on the aetiology of ischaemic heart disease...|$|E
5000|$|Although machine {{moulding}} {{was first}} introduced into Australia in the late 19th century the FMU initially refused to admit machine and plate moulders into the union, regarding the work as relatively unskilled compared to that done by fully qualified 'jobbing' moulders. These workers were therefore organised by industrial unions, such as the Federated Stove and Piano Frame Makers Association of Australia and the Federated Agricultural Implement Machinery and Ironworkers Association of Australia. In 1920 the FMU did expand its coverage to allow machine moulders to join, although the union's staunch opposition to the <b>piece-work</b> system of <b>payment</b> under which most machine moulders worked meant that few could become members. Despite its exclusive attitude towards membership, which kept {{the total number of}} FMU members low throughout its existence, the vital position of moulders in major industries such as mining, manufacturing and the railways ensured that the union remained industrially powerful. In 1983 the FMU merged with the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union (AMWSU) to form the Amalgamated Metals, Foundry and Shipwrights' Union.|$|R
