5|$|Each {{chromatophore}} contains pigment of {{only one}} colour. In fish and frogs, colour change is mediated {{by the type of}} chromatophores known as melanophores that contain dark pigment. A melanophore is star-shaped; it contains many small <b>pigmented</b> organelles which can be dispersed throughout the cell, or aggregated near its centre. When the <b>pigmented</b> organelles are dispersed, the cell makes a patch of the animal's skin appear dark; when they are aggregated, most of the cell, and the animal's skin, appears light. In frogs, the change is controlled relatively slowly, mainly by hormones. In fish, the change is controlled by the brain, which sends signals directly to the chromatophores, as well as producing hormones.|$|E
5|$|Fruit bodies can be parasitized by the mold-like fungus Sepedonium ampullosporum.

40|$|Author abstract]This {{experiment}} was initiated {{in order to}} separate the induced browning <b>pigments</b> of potato tubers treated with nematocide DBCP. Two browning <b>pigments</b> of dark brown and black were separated from browning tubers. The <b>pigments</b> were essentially identical with the properties of <b>pigments</b> prepared from chlorogenic acid or L-DOPA in vitro. But solubitity in water showed the difference between two <b>pigments</b> and also <b>pigments</b> prepared from chlorogenic acid and L-DOPA.

5|$|Butterfly {{adults are}} {{characterized}} by their four scale-covered wings, which give the Lepidoptera their name (Ancient Greek λεπίς lepís, scale + πτερόν pterón, wing). These scales give butterfly wings their colour: they are <b>pigmented</b> with melanins that give them blacks and browns, as well as uric acid derivatives and flavones that give them yellows, {{but many of the}} blues, greens, reds and iridescent colours are created by structural coloration produced by the micro-structures of the scales and hairs.|$|E

5|$|The large upper incisors are orthodont, {{with their}} cutting edge {{at about a}} right angle to the upper molars, and heavily <b>pigmented</b> with orange. Those of T.hylophilus are narrower, less procumbent, and less <b>pigmented.</b> The orthodont upper incisors suffice to {{distinguish}} T.ucucha from all {{other members of the}} genus but T.australis and T.daphne, which have much shorter and narrower incisors. The left and right molar rows are parallel. The molars are more hypsodont (high-crowned) than in other Thomasomys. The anterocone, the cusp {{at the front of the}} first upper molar, is divided into distinct cuspules at the lingual (inner) and labial (outer) sides by an anteromedian flexus. The accessory ridges on the upper molars, the anterolophs and mesolophs, are less well-developed than in T.hylophilus. The third upper molar is reduced relative to the second, much more so than in T.hylophilus. The lower molars are generally similar to the uppers, but the anteroconid (the equivalent of the anterocone on the first lower molar) is often undivided and the third molar is unreduced.|$|E
5|$|The {{reverse of}} countershading, with the belly <b>pigmented</b> {{darker than the}} back, enhances {{contrast}} and so makes animals more conspicuous. It is found in animals that can defend themselves, such as skunks. The pattern is used both in startle or deimatic displays and as a signal to warn off experienced predators. However, animals that habitually live upside-down but lack strong defences, like the Nile catfish and the luna moth caterpillar, have upside-down countershading for camouflage.|$|E
5|$|The soft, dense {{feathers}} {{are kept}} in good condition by preening.

All adult waxwings have a complete moult annually between August and January. Juveniles moult at the same time but retain their flight and some other wing feathers.|$|E
40|$|Duerre, John A. (University of North Dakota, Grand Forks), and Patrick J. Buckley. <b>Pigment</b> {{production}} from tryptophan by an Achromobacter species. J. Bacteriol. 90 : 1686 – 1691. 1965. —A microorganism was {{isolated from the}} soil near the University of North Dakota. Biochemical and morphological characteristics indicated that this organism would best be classified {{as a member of}} the family Achromobacteraceae, genus Achromobacter, species unknown. The organism produced a red <b>pigment</b> when grown in a medium containing yeast extract and tryptophan. The pH optimum for <b>pigment</b> production was about 8. 0 and the optimal temperature was 25 C. During a study of the nutritional requirements for growth and <b>pigment</b> production, it was found that the organism would grow and produce <b>pigment</b> in a medium containing tryptophan and nucleosides, but the rate of both growth and <b>pigment</b> formation in this medium was slower than that observed with tryptophan and yeast extract. The organism grew well in the presence of acid-hydrolyzed casein and nucleosides without producing <b>pigment,</b> indicating that the <b>pigment</b> is not necessary for growth. Resting-cell experiments definitely established tryptophan as the sole exogenous requirement for <b>pigment</b> production. The <b>pigment</b> was extracted from yeast extract-tryptophan medium with chloroform. Thin layer chromatographic analysis of the crude <b>pigment</b> extracted from this medium revealed the presence of two other <b>pigments</b> in addition to the major red <b>pigment.</b> One of these was a highly fluorescent orange <b>pigment</b> and the other a pink <b>pigment.</b> Only the red <b>pigment</b> was produced by resting cells in the presence of tryptophan alone. This <b>pigment</b> served as an electron acceptor when coupled with formic dehydrogenase, indicating its possible function as an oxidation-reduction <b>pigment.</b> The oxidized <b>pigment</b> had absorption peaks at 506 and 304 mμ. The peak at 506 mμ disappeared upon reduction with sodium sulfite. Shaking the reduced <b>pigment</b> in air proved to be an unsatisfactory method for returning the reduced <b>pigment</b> to the oxidized, colored state...|$|R

5|$|The spores of Myxogastria are haploid, mainly {{round and}} measure between 5µm and 20µm, rarely up to 24µm in diameter.

The middle thoracic segment has an operculum on the underside, which may extend posteriorly and obscure parts of the abdomen. The abdomen is segmented, with the hindermost segments housing the reproductive organs, and terminates in females with a large, saw-edged ovipositor. In males, the abdomen is largely hollow and used as a resonating chamber.|$|E
30|$|Thin layer {{chromatography}} (TLC) {{showed that}} the intracellular <b>pigment</b> bands before and after extraction were mainly dominated by two common orange <b>pigments</b> (Fig.  3 C, c and d). However, the brightness in the latter was weak, which illustrated {{that some of the}} orange <b>pigments</b> were transported to the outside after extractive cultivation (Fig.  3 B, lanes 5 and 7). Nearly no orange <b>pigments</b> bands could be seen, but a relatively high brightness of the yellow <b>pigment</b> bands was present in the first batch extract, which implied that the yellow <b>pigments</b> were the dominant <b>pigment</b> in the extracellular broth (Fig.  3 B, lane 4). In the following two repeated batches of extractive cultivation, the brightness of the yellow <b>pigment</b> bands gradually decreased, whereas the orange <b>pigments</b> relatively increased in contrast (Fig.  3 B, C, lanes 2 and 3). After the fourth batch of extractive culture, almost no yellow <b>pigments</b> and only certain orange <b>pigments</b> were extracted (Fig.  3 B, C, lane 1). Therefore, this further proved that there was an extractive saturation of <b>pigment</b> by TX, and the <b>pigment</b> characteristic was changed in the repeated extractive cultivation. Moreover, the intracellular yellow and orange <b>pigments</b> might be converted during the extraction process of trans-membrane secretion.|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to canthaxanthin, seven <b>pigment</b> fractions were isolated from Micrococcus roseus. They were purified by solvent partitioning and by column and thin-layer chromatography.
