5|$|The promotional {{video for}} the song was filmed in December 1967, for the Central Office of Information in London.

The video features Barrett (shown with an acoustic guitar for the first time) and the group miming to the song in a more conventional stage setting, with psychedelic projections in the background. The original audio to the <b>promo</b> is lost, and most versions use the BBC recording from late 1967, consequently causing sync issues most evident as Barrett sings the opening verse. The original film was considered to be lost, until it was re-discovered in the Manchester Arts Lab in 1999. Barrett and Waters first watched the <b>promo</b> video during the second week of December 1967.|$|E
