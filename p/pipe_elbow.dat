40|$|AbstractHydrogen {{assisted}} macrodelamination in {{the pipe}} elbows of 40 -year exploited lateral pipelines located behind the compressor station was studied. The crack on the external {{surface of the}} <b>pipe</b> <b>elbow</b> was revealed. Macrodelamination was occurred in the steel being influenced by the joined action of working loads and hydrogen absorbed by metal during long-term operation. The causes of the material degradation were investigated by non-destructive testing using ultrasound thickness meter, observing microstructure, hydrostatic pressure testing, and mechanical properties testing of pipe steel. Intensive degradation of steel, primarily essential reduction of plasticity was revealed. The degradation degree of the <b>pipe</b> <b>elbow</b> steel was higher than of the straight pipe steel regardless of a section was tensioned or compressed. Basing on the tensile tests carried out on cylindrical smooth and notched specimens from the <b>pipe</b> <b>elbow</b> steel it was established that the plasticity of the damaged steel could be measured correctly only on the specimens with a circular notch due to concentration of deformation in the cross section location only. The limitations in using elongation and reduction in area for characterisation of plasticity of the pipe steel with extensive delamination were defined. The diagnostic features of macrodelamination, namely an abnormal thickness meter readings and a sharp decrease in hardness and plasticity of the <b>pipe</b> <b>elbow</b> steel were established...|$|E

As {{a result of}} the {{relative displacement}}, the seismic risks of some components in the building could increase. The possibility of an increase in seismic risks is especially high in the crossover piping system in the buildings. Previous studies found that an elbow which could be ruptured by low-cycle ratcheting fatigue is one of the weakest elements. Fatigue curves for elbows were suggested based on component tests. However, it is hard to find a quantitative evaluation of the ultimate state of piping elbows. Generally, the energy dissipation of a solid structure can be calculated from the relation between displacement and force. Therefore, in this study, the ultimate state of the <b>pipe</b> <b>elbow,</b> normally considered as failure of the <b>pipe</b> <b>elbow,</b> is defined as leakage under in-plane cyclic loading tests, and a failure estimation method is proposed using a damage index based on energy dissipation...|$|E

However, the laser-scanned data of an existing plant has an enormous amount ofpoints, captures inmcate objects, and includes a high noise level, so the manual reconstmction of a 3 D model is very time-consuming and costly. Among plant equipment, piping systems account for the greatest proportion.

The straight pomon pipes, connecting parts, and connection relationship ofthe piping system can be recognized in this algorithm. Normal-based region growing and cylinder surface fitting can extract all possible locations ofpipes, including straight <b>pipes,</b> <b>elbows,</b> and junctions. Tracing the axes of a piping system enables the recognition of the positions of these elements and their connection relationship.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to understand the fatigue crack growth behavior and validate analytical procedures for austenitic stainless steel and carbon steel pipes, pipe welds and elbows. The study involved fatigue tests on actual components and specimens. The Paris law has been used for the prediction of fatigue crack growth life. Paris constants have been determined for pipe (base), pipe weld and <b>pipe</b> <b>elbow</b> materials by using Compact Tension (CT) /Three Point Bend (TPB) specimens machined from the actual pipe, pipe weld and <b>pipe</b> <b>elbow.</b> Analyses have been carried out to predict the fatigue crack growth life of these piping components having part through cracks on the outer surface. In the analyses, Stress Intensity Factor (K) has been evaluated through two different schemes. The first scheme considers the ‘K’ evaluations at two points of the crack front i. e. maximum crack depth and crack tip end at the outer surface. The second scheme accounts for the area averaged root mean square stress intensity factor (KRMS) at deepest and surface points. In order to validate the analytical procedure/results, experiments have been carried out on full scale pipes, pipe welds with part through circumferential crack. The tests have also been conducted on the full scale carbon steel elbows having part-through circumferential notch at intrados location and axial notch at crown location on the outer surface. Fatigue crack growth life evaluated using both schemes have been compared with experimental results. Use of stress intensity factor (KRMS) evaluated using second scheme gives better fatigue crack growth life prediction compared to that of first scheme...|$|E
40|$|Finite element {{analyses}} {{have been}} performed to investigate behaviour of postulated cracks in the longitudinal weld of a 90 ° <b>pipe</b> <b>elbow</b> in the reactor coolant line of a German PWR. At the extrados a pipe whip restraint is welded on the outer surface of the elbow {{in order to prevent}} pipe whip for the postulated double-ended rupture. However, this arrangement significantly increases the effort for non-destructive testing (NDT) during in-service inspections. Moreover, weld sections of about 80 mm to 160 mm length cannot be accessed by NDT from outside. According to the German RSK (Reactor Safety Commission) Guideline, cracks postulated in areas of restricted access for NDT or in non-examinable zones should not cause a catastrophic failure of the reactor coolant line. To assure the safety of the <b>pipe</b> <b>elbow</b> against crack initiation and unstable propagation, numerical stress and crack driving force calculations are carried out taking into account the real geometry of the pipe whip restraint. Both Service Level A Loadings and Service Level D Loadings (e. g. earth quake, plane crash) are investigated. For comparison purposes the same elbow geometry without restraint is analysed. The material Ji value and the slope dJ/da of the measured JR-curve are employed as criteria for crack initiation and instability. The result suggest the critical length of a through crack (2 c) at initiation to be of some 800 mm which is considerably larger than the length of the non-examinable zone. Furthermore, by comparing the s lope of the Jappl(2 c) curve with the material resistance curve, a conclusion can be drawn that no crack instability may occur for any crack size below the length of the pipe whip restraint. The restraint arrangement considerably increases t he carrying capacity and residual strength of the elbow...|$|E
