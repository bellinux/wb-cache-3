5|$|Iron metal {{has been}} used since ancient times, {{although}} copper alloys, which have lower melting temperatures, were used even earlier in human history. <b>Pure</b> <b>iron</b> is relatively soft, but is unobtainable by smelting because it is significantly hardened and strengthened by impurities, in particular carbon, from the smelting process. A certain proportion of carbon (between 0.002% and 2.1%) produces steel, which may be up to 1000times harder than <b>pure</b> <b>iron.</b> Crude iron metal is produced in blast furnaces, where ore is reduced by coke to pig iron, which has a high carbon content. Further refinement with oxygen reduces the carbon content to the correct proportion to make steel. Steels and iron alloys formed with other metals (alloy steels) {{are by far the}} most common industrial metals because they have a great range of desirable properties and iron-bearing rock is abundant.|$|E

5|$|Alternatively {{pig iron}} {{may be made}} into steel (with up to about 2% carbon) or wrought iron (commercially <b>pure</b> <b>iron).</b> Various {{processes}} {{have been used for}} this, including finery forges, puddling furnaces, Bessemer converters, open hearth furnaces, basic oxygen furnaces, and electric arc furnaces. In all cases, the objective is to oxidize {{some or all of the}} carbon, together with other impurities. On the other hand, other metals may be added to make alloy steels.|$|E
5|$|Iron is {{the most}} widely used of all the metals, {{accounting}} for over 90% of worldwide metal production. Its low cost and high strength make it indispensable in engineering applications such as the construction of machinery and machine tools, automobiles, the hulls of large ships, and structural components for buildings. Since <b>pure</b> <b>iron</b> is quite soft, it is most commonly combined with alloying elements to make steel.|$|E
5|$|Pig iron is not <b>pure</b> <b>iron,</b> but has 4–5% carbon {{dissolved}} {{in it with}} small amounts of other impurities like sulfur, magnesium, phosphorus and manganese. As the carbon is the major impurity, the iron (pig iron) becomes brittle and hard. Removing the other impurities results in cast iron, {{which is used to}} cast articles in foundries such as stoves, pipes, radiators, lamp-posts and rails.|$|E
50|$|The {{chemical}} composition of hammerscale is disputed and varies greatly. Most sources agree that hammerscale {{is composed of}} some form of iron oxide. Magnetite is a generally accepted form, giving hammerscale its notable magnetic character. However, hammerscale’s {{chemical composition}} can change depending on from which stage in the iron purification process it derives; for flakes and spheroids from early stages, the composition will be largely mixed whereas flakes from late stages will be <b>purer</b> <b>iron</b> oxide forms. Ultimately, some still argue that the chemical components of hammerscale besides iron vary widely beyond ionized oxygen to form a metal oxide.|$|R
50|$|Bessemer {{licensed}} {{the patent}} for his process to five ironmasters, {{but from the}} outset, the companies had great difficulty producing good quality steel. Mr Göran Fredrik Göransson, a Swedish ironmaster, using the <b>purer</b> charcoal pig <b>iron</b> of that country, {{was the first to}} make good steel by the process, but only after many attempts. His results prompted Bessemer to try a <b>purer</b> <b>iron</b> obtained from Cumberland hematite, but even with this he had only limited success because the quantity of carbon was difficult to control. Robert Forester Mushet, had carried out thousands of experiments at Darkhill Ironworks, in the Forest of Dean, and had shown that the quantity of carbon could be controlled by removing almost all of it from the iron and then adding an exact amount of carbon and manganese, in the form of spiegeleisen. This improved the quality of the finished product and increased its malleability.|$|R

5|$|A Roman bath {{house and}} Edwardian folly {{in the village}} of Whitestaunton were {{excavated}} by the archaeological television programme Time Team. There is also evidence of iron workings in the Romano-British period, at Dunkeswell, which radiocarbon dating has placed in the 2nd century. It has been suggested that these and other iron-based technologies gave the hills a fairly industrial landscape during the Romano-British period, providing a source of the name Blackdown Hills. Local iron ores were smelted at Hemyock in small bloomeries (furnaces) to produce <b>pure</b> <b>iron</b> until the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{experimental}} {{archaeology and}} history re-enactment have shown {{there is only}} a very short step from the Catalan forge to the true blast furnace, where the iron is gained as pig iron in liquid phase. Usually, obtaining the iron in liquid phase is actually undesired, and the temperature is intentionally kept below the melting point of iron, since while removing the solid bloom mechanically is tedious and means batch process instead of continuous process, it is almost <b>pure</b> <b>iron</b> and can be worked immediately. On the other hand, pig iron is the eutectic mixture of carbon and iron and needs to be described to produce steel or wrought iron, which was extremely tedious in the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|The {{carbon content}} of steel is between 0.002% and 2.14% by weight for plain ironcarbon alloys. These values vary {{depending}} on alloying elements such as manganese, chromium, nickel, iron, tungsten, carbon and so on. Basically, steel is an iron-carbon alloy that does not undergo eutectic reaction. In contrast, cast iron does undergo eutectic reaction. Too little carbon content leaves (<b>pure)</b> <b>iron</b> quite soft, ductile, and weak. Carbon contents {{higher than those of}} steel make an alloy, commonly called pig iron, that is brittle (not malleable). While iron alloyed with carbon is called carbon steel, alloy steel is steel to which other alloying elements have been intentionally added to modify the characteristics of steel. Common alloying elements include: manganese, nickel, chromium, molybdenum, boron, titanium, vanadium, tungsten, cobalt, and niobium. Additional elements are also important in steel: phosphorus, sulfur, silicon, and traces of oxygen, nitrogen, and copper, that are most frequently considered undesirable.|$|E

25|$|Hematite is colored {{black to}} steel or silver-gray, brown to reddish brown, or red. It is mined {{as the main}} ore of iron. Varieties include kidney ore, martite (pseudomorphs after magnetite), iron rose and specularite (specular {{hematite}}). While the forms of hematite vary, they all have a rust-red streak. Hematite is harder than <b>pure</b> <b>iron,</b> but much more brittle. Maghemite is a hematite- and magnetite-related oxide mineral.|$|E
25|$|The small {{particles}} of iron produced {{in this way}} fall {{to the bottom of}} the furnace and become welded together to form a spongy mass of the bloom. The bottom of the furnace also fills with molten slag, often consisting of fayalite, a compound of silicon, oxygen and iron mixed with other impurities from the ore. Because the bloom is highly porous, and its open spaces are full of slag, the bloom must later be reheated and beaten with a hammer to drive the molten slag out of it. Iron treated this way is said to be wrought, and the resulting nearly <b>pure</b> <b>iron</b> wrought iron.|$|E

40|$|First {{principles}} {{electronic structure}} calculations based on density functional theory {{have been used}} to study the thermodynamic, structural and transport properties of solid solutions and liquid alloys of iron and oxygen at Earth’s core conditions. Aims of the work are to determine the oxygen concentration needed to account for the inferred density in the outer core, to probe the stability of the liquid against phase separation, to interpret the bonding in the liquid, and to find out whether the viscosity differs significantly from that of <b>pure</b> liquid <b>iron</b> at the same conditions. It is shown that the required concentration of oxygen is in the region 25 − 30 mol percent, and evidence is presented for phase stability at these conditions. The Fe-O bonding is partly ionic, but with a strong covalent component. The viscosity is lower than that of <b>pure</b> liquid <b>iron</b> at Earth’s core conditions. It is shown that earlier first-principles calculations indicating very large enthalpies of formation of solid solutions may need reinterpretation, since the assumed crystal structures are not the most stable at the oxygen concentration of interest. ...|$|R
25|$|In operation, the {{bloomery}} is preheated {{by burning}} charcoal, and once hot, iron ore and additional charcoal are introduced through the top, in a roughly one-to-one ratio. Inside the furnace, carbon monoxide from the incomplete combustion of the charcoal reduces the iron oxides in the ore to metallic iron, without melting the ore; {{this allows the}} bloomery to operate at lower temperatures than the melting temperature of the ore. Since the desired product of a bloomery is easily forgeable, nearly <b>pure</b> <b>iron,</b> with a low carbon content, the temperature and ratio of charcoal to iron ore must be carefully controlled to keep the iron from absorbing the carbon and becoming unforgeable. Limestone could also {{be added to the}} bloomery, about 10% of the ore weight, which would act as flux and help carry away impurities.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen {{and other}} {{elements}} within iron act as softening agents that promote the movement of dislocations that naturally exist in the iron atom crystal lattices. Varying the amount of alloying elements—their formation in the iron hydride either as solute elements, or as precipitated phases—enables the movement of those dislocations that make iron so ductile and weak, and thus controls qualities such as the hardness, ductility, and tensile strength of the resulting iron hydride. Iron hydride's ductility compared to <b>pure</b> <b>iron</b> is only possible {{at the expense of}} strength, of which elemental iron has a relative deficiency. However, iron hydride is metastable and subject to the rapid formation of a precipitated phase of gaseous dihydrogen, a process known as hydrogen embrittlement. Thus, the material properties of iron hydride are time-sensitive. One alloying element intentionally added to modify the characteristics of iron hydride is titanium.|$|E
25|$|This is now done {{by forcing}} a jet of {{high-pressure}} oxygen into a special rotating container containing the pig iron. Some {{of the carbon}} is oxidised into carbon monoxide, CO, and carbon dioxide, CO2. This also oxidizes impurities in the pig iron. The container is rotated and the processed pig iron can {{be separated from the}} oxidised impurities. Before the mid 19th century, pig iron from the blast furnace was made into wrought iron, which is commercially <b>pure</b> <b>iron.</b> At that period, if steel was needed, particularly pure varieties of iron were heated with charcoal in a cementation furnace to produce blister steel (with about 1-2% carbon). This might be further purified using the crucible technique, but steel was too expensive to use on a large scale. However, with the introduction of the Bessemer process in the late 1850s and then other processes, the production of steel was dramatically increased. By the late 19th century most iron was being converted to steel before use.|$|E

These reaction models were tested using data from a series of experiments. The results indicate that under the present experimental conditions, the temperature and the FeO content, other than slag basicity, have some effects on the reduction of molybdenum oxide from steelmaking slags by <b>pure</b> liquid <b>iron.</b> Both the molybdenum oxide reduction rate and final reduction ratio increase with an increase of temperature and a decrease of FeO content.

30|$|Cosmochemical abundances {{suggest that}} the bulk of the core is made of iron, with some Ni and light elements. In {{addition}} to cosmochemical arguments, light elements are required to balance the density deficit of the Earth’s outer fluid core compared with <b>pure</b> fluid <b>iron</b> and of the solid inner core with respect to <b>pure</b> solid <b>iron</b> (e.g., McDonough 2014). It is commonly assumed that sulfur is the most likely candidate for the light elements in the cores of terrestrial planets and moons (e.g., Ringwood 1977; McCammon et al. 1983). First, it is abundant in the solar system and is a siderophile (an element that is preferentially enriched in the iron melt), and it is thus likely enriched in the core upon core formation. Second, iron meteorites consist of pure Fe–Ni, with varying amounts of sulfides (FeS). These meteorites are believed to be remnants of iron-rich cores from planetesimals that have differentiated during their early evolution and are considered building blocks of the terrestrial planets. The Fe–FeS system is a eutectic system. It is usually assumed that the compositions of most terrestrial planets are on the Fe-rich side of the eutectic composition (e.g., Lodders and Fegley 1998), while for the large Jovian moons (e.g., Scott et al. 2002) and Mars (e.g., Stewart et al. 2007), this is under debate.|$|R
