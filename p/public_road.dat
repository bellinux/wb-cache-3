5|$|Due to the {{configuration}} of the Circuit de Monaco, with its low average speed and abundance of low-speed corners, allied to the low-grip nature of the <b>public</b> <b>road</b> surface, the teams all set their cars up to produce the maximum amount of downforce and mechanical grip possible. Benetton modified their car's suspensions to work better on the circuit's low-speed corners. The Minardi cars came equipped with a new titanium cast gearbox and new rear suspensions. McLaren brought an additional spare car to the event, with four in total being shared between Häkkinen and Coulthard.|$|E

5|$|Tite and Cubitt's {{design was}} based around a three storey main building, {{separated}} from the LSWR's main viaduct by a private access road beneath the LNC's twin rail lines, intended to allow mourners to arrive and leave discreetly, and avoid the need for hearses to stop in the <b>public</b> <b>road.</b> The building housed two mortuaries, the LNC's boardroom and funerary workshops, {{and a series of}} separate waiting rooms for those attending first, second and third class funerals. A steam-powered lift carried coffins from the lower floors to the platform level above. Although the original London terminus did not have its own chapel, on some occasions mourners would not be able or willing to make the journey to a ceremony at Brookwood but for personal or religious reasons were unable to hold the funeral service in a London church. On these occasions one of the waiting rooms would be used as a makeshift funeral chapel.|$|E

In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, pre-1927 Route 13 became Route 27 and the Trenton and New Brunswick Turnpike, which ran parallel to pre-1927 Route 13 in Trenton, became Route 26.

5|$|The 1920s saw high {{inflation}} and large public deficits. Several public committees were created solely to cut costs. One such proposal {{was to build}} a road to Flåm, with the proposal being led by Hans Kristian Seip, who was director of Bergen <b>Public</b> <b>Road</b> Administration. In 1925, following the appointment of Mowinckel's First Cabinet, it was proposed that the railway be built as a road, and the tracks laid later. One of NSB's board members proposed instead building a suspended railway. The plans to cancel the railway were stopped because of parliamentarian support for the railway. Part of the political support was because there was agreement on a national railway plan, and removing parts of it would disrupt the geographical compromise. However, Parliament did vote {{to reduce the number}} of intermediate stations to one, which would allow trains to meet at Berekvam. The cost saving for a road was estimated at 30 percent.

40|$|The primary {{network of}} forest <b>roads</b> {{consists}} of <b>public</b> and forest truck <b>roads.</b> <b>Public</b> <b>roads</b> in one forest area have been mainly built due to needs of local communities, access to rural areas, {{the development of}} tourism, recreation and so on. Forest truck roads have been built and maintained by those who manage forests (the forest management), while <b>public</b> <b>roads</b> have been managed by the Directorate for Roads of the Federation of B&H and cantonal and local governments. In the last twenty years, the sector for wood assortments transport in the Federation of B&H {{is in charge of}} the private transport operators which use vehicles of large capacities and high axle loads for the purpose of transport of as large as possible quantities of wooden mass per time unit. Due to this fact, the roads have deteriorated faster. The accelerated deterioration of the roads used for the transport of wooden assortments imposes the need for the allocation of larger funds for their maintenance. Due to the increasing damages on the roads the prohibitions of use of some <b>public</b> <b>roads</b> for wooden assortments transport occur more frequently. The aim of the research is to determine the total length of <b>public</b> <b>roads</b> which open Forest Management Units of Sarajevo Canton (FMU of SC) and to investigate the possibility of using these categories of roads for forestry. For examination and analysis possibilities of using <b>public</b> <b>roads</b> for wooden assortments transport qualitative research - polls methods have been applied within the framework of the key representatives of the target groups such as forestry and the local community. In the questionnaire, two sets of questions were specified, the first one which is designed to determine the possible existence of problems of using <b>public</b> <b>roads</b> for transport of wooden assortments and possible causes of occurrence of the problems. The second group of questions gives some of the possible solutions for solving the problems of using <b>public</b> <b>roads</b> for the purpose of transport of wood assortments. The results of the survey show that the share of <b>public</b> <b>roads</b> for opening forest truck roads of Canton Sarajevo amounts 44. 94 %. The given results illustrate that the cases of prohibition of use of <b>public</b> <b>roads</b> for wood assortments transport are rare. The largest proportion of respondents (65 %) pleaded that there are no problems (conditions) for using <b>public</b> <b>roads</b> within their territory. A share of 32 % of respondents said that there are some requirements for the use of <b>public</b> <b>roads</b> for the transport of wood assortments in their territory and those are mostly demands that FMU covers the costs of maintenance of these roads. A share of 58 % of respondents gave the answer that those requirements originate from self-organized groups of citizens. A share of 42 % of respondents gave the answer that these requirements originate from the local community (municipalities and lower levels). In the second group of questions, where the proposal for resolving the problems of wood assortments transport in case of inability of use the existing <b>public</b> <b>roads</b> have been given the majority of respondents consider that the solution of problem is making agreement on the mode of usage and application of more control of axle loads of truck which transport wood assortments by <b>public</b> <b>roads.</b> The general conclusion of the research is that the undisturbed use of <b>public</b> <b>roads</b> for forestry needs is possible only with more consideration of the legal guidelines and with continuous agreements of all stakeholders accompanied by constant control...|$|R
