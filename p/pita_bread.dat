5|$|Letting bean dip {{sit for a}} {{while before}} serving can {{increase}} the intermingling of flavors in the dish. Bean dip can be served cold, at room temperature, or as a hot dish. Hot bean dip can be prepared ahead of time, refrigerated and then cooked at a later time, and can also be prepared using a slow cooker and served in the appliance. Bean dip can be prepared as a vegan and gluten-free dish. The dish is typically served with tortilla chips, and can also be served with crackers, crudités, breadsticks, <b>pita</b> <b>bread</b> and toasted bread such as baguette.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pita</b> <b>bread</b> is a {{double-layered}} flat or pocket bread traditional in many Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisines. It is baked plain, {{or with a}} topping of sesame or nigella seeds or za'atar. Pita is used {{in multiple}} ways, such as stuffed with falafel, salads or various meats as a snack or fast food meal; packed with schnitzel, salad and French fries for lunch; filled with chocolate spread as a snack for schoolchildren; or broken into pieces for scooping up hummus, eggplant and other dips. A lafa is larger, soft flatbread that is rolled up with a falafel or shawarma filling. Various ethnic groups continue to bake traditional flat breads. Jews from the former Soviet republic of Georgia make the flatbread, lavash.|$|E

25|$|Lebanese cuisine is {{influenced}} by other Mediterranean cuisines. <b>Pita</b> <b>bread</b> is a staple. The Lebanese enjoy hummus (a chick pea dip), fool (a fava bean dip), and other bean dishes. Rice is nearly a staple, and pasta is very popular. Salted yogurt is common in many dishes. Red meat and chicken are common but are usually eaten {{as part of a}} dish. Eating in Lebanon is tied to family: people almost never eat alone. The Lebanese consider eating out a social and almost aesthetic experience. During Lent, Christians eat meatless dishes and at Halloween, they eat a variety of wheat-based dishes. Lebanon sells fruits and vegetables to neighboring Arab countries, as well as to Italy, France, and the United States. Wine is produced in the Bekaa and exported to France.|$|E

50|$|On {{a culinary}} level, bread is {{commonly}} used as gamosa, a utensil, {{at the same time}} providing carbohydrates and protein to the Egyptian diet. Egyptians use bread to scoop up food, sauces, and dips and to wrap kebabs, falafel, and the like in the manner of sandwiches. Most <b>pita</b> <b>breads</b> are baked at high temperatures (450 °F or 232 °C), causing the flattened rounds of dough to puff up dramatically. When removed from the oven, the layers of baked dough remain separated inside the deflated pita, which allows the bread to be opened into pockets, creating a space for use in various dishes.|$|R

Many snack vendors prepare these sandwiches {{and they can be}} found all over Libya. Libyan restaurants may serve international cuisine, or may serve simpler fare such as lamb, chicken, vegetable stew, potatoes and macaroni. Due to severe lack of infrastructure, many under-developed areas and small towns do not have restaurants and instead food stores may be the only source to obtain food products. Alcohol consumption is illegal in the entire country.|$|E

5|$|The cuisine of the Galilee is {{very similar}} to Lebanese cuisine, due to the {{extensive}} communication between the two regions before the establishment of Israel. The Galilee specializes in a number of meals based on the combination of bulgur, spices and meat, known as kubbi by Arabs. Kubbi bi-siniyee is a combination of minced lamb or beef mixed with pepper, allspice and other spices wrapped in a bulgur crust, then baked. Kubbi bi-siniyee could serve as the main dish during a Palestinian lunch. Kubbi neyee is a variation of kubbi, that is served as raw meat mixed with bulgur and a variety of spices. It is mostly eaten as a side dish and <b>pita</b> or markook <b>bread</b> is used for scooping the meat. Since the dish is raw, whatever is not eaten is cooked the next day in either the baked version or as fried kibbee balls.|$|R
40|$|The {{extent of}} phytate {{degradation}} in breads and various foods consumed in Saudi Arabia was followed after baking or cooking. Phytate phosphorus content in raw and baked or cooked food {{was determined by}} ion-exchange and colorimetric methods. White bread containing soda, namely Tamees, had a lower degree of phytate degradation followed by <b>pita</b> brown <b>bread,</b> namely Burr, in comparison to pita, French and pan white breads not containing soda, namely Mafrood, Samouli and Toast, respectively. The phytate content in breads ranged from 0. 11 to 0. 28 %. Wheat-based food made from whole wheat flour, namely Margoog, had a lower degree of phytate degradation in comparison to other wheat-based foods made from bulgur, grits and partially debranned grains, namely Kibbah, Gerish and Harees, respectively. The phytate contents in these foods ranged from 0. 08 to 0. 25 %. Rice-based foods made from parboiled rice, namely Kabsa, or not drained from steeping or cooking water, namely Saleeg, had a lower phytate degradation than rice drained from steeping or cooking water, namely Baryani or Rus Abiedh. The phytate content in these foods was lower and ranged from 0. 04 to 0. 1 %. Similarly, faba beans-based food not drained from cooking water, namely Food Jerra, Mudames, Falafe and Balila. The phytate contents in these foods ranged from 0. 11 to 0. 4 %. Food recipes and baking conditions or cooking procedures are the main factors that affect the extent of phytate degradation. To avoid adverse effects on mineral nutrients, reduction in the phytate content of the phytate-rich foods such as Burr bread, Margoog and Foul Jerra foods, is recommended...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{interest}} for functional foods rich in dietary fibre (DF) {{and low in}} glycaemic response (GR) is steadily increasing. This is because DF could reduce GR of food products and protect and restrict diet-associated diseases which have become common in society. But DF rich products are not always high in quality and palatability. Therefore, more fibre-rich functional products need to be designed and developed with good quality, palatability and longer shelf life. A response surface methodology (RSM) was used to develop both <b>pita</b> and Tandoori <b>breads</b> rich in DF with good quality, palatability and longer shelf life. So, {{a wide range of}} three different functional ingredients (FI) (inulin (IN) up to 8 %, Guar gum (GG) up to 2 % and waxy wheat flour (WWF) up to 15 %) alone and in combination was selected, to investigate their influences on the cooking properties, bread quality, sensory characteristics, shelf life and GR. The results showed that the FI affected cooking properties differently. IN and WWF reduced almost all the viscosity parameters. In contrast, GG increased them. The data from dough assessment showed that none of the additives changed the quality and processability. Furthermore, the outcomes from the physical and instrumental assessments of the breads indicated that although there were some modifications in the bread quality, the FI did not change the quality of the breads drastically. The sensory evaluation results showed that the FI addition resulted in acceptable sensory attributes and palatability. The results also showed that some of the sensory attributes were significantly improved through adding the FI. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images clearly demonstrated the influence of the FI on the starch granules gelatinisation. It is very evident that the granules are less swollen when DFs are added. The in vivo trial results indicate that DFs incorporated into bread could change the digestibility of starch and lowered the GR in comparison to the controls. This could be attributed to a number of factors. Gelatinisation may influence the granule structure and degree of amylase and amylopectin readily solubilised. The gels formed by DFs could restrict the accessibility of α-amylase to the starch granules. A mechanism would be linked to viscous layers of soluble DFs becoming physical barriers which could limit the uptake of digested carbohydrate in the small intestine.
