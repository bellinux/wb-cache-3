50|$|Targeting {{signals are}} {{the pieces of}} {{information}} that enable the cellular transport machinery to correctly position a protein inside or outside the cell. This information is contained in the polypeptide chain or in the folded protein. The continuous stretch of amino acid residues in the chain that enables targeting are called signal peptides or targeting peptides. There {{are two types of}} targeting peptides, the <b>presequences</b> and the internal targeting peptides. The <b>presequences</b> of the targeting peptide are often found at the N-terminal extension and is composed of between 6-136 basic and hydrophobic amino acids. In case of peroxisomes the targeting sequence is on the C-terminal extension mostly. Other signals, known as signal patches, are composed of parts which are separate in the primary sequence. They become functional when folding brings them together on the protein surface. In addition, protein modifications like glycosylations can induce targeting.|$|R
50|$|Mitochondrial-processing {{peptidase}} (MPP) is a metalloendopeptidase, containing two structurally related subunits, Subunit alpha and mitochondrial-processing peptidase subunit beta, {{working in}} conjunction for its catalytic function.

Alu repeat elements have been identified within the region -1052/-770 relative to the cap site and in intron 7. The precursor polypeptide contains 290 amino acid residues, with an N-terminal <b>presequence</b> of 29 residues, a 5'-untranslated sequence of 21 bp and a 3'-untranslated sequence of 391 bp.|$|E
50|$|There {{are various}} {{mitochondrial}} import pathways that exist {{to facilitate the}} import of precursor proteins to their destined mitochondrial subcompartments. HSP90 aids the delivery of the mitochondrial preprotein to the TOM complex in an ATP-dependent process. Many precursor proteins (those that are destined for the matrix) contain amino-terminal presequences that carry information required for the targeting of proteins to the mitochondrial matrix These matrix targeting signals generally contain 10-80 amino acid residues that take on the conformation of an amphipathic-α helix and contain one positive and hydrophobic face. Once the precursor reaches the matrix, the <b>presequence</b> is typically cleaved off by the matrix processing peptidase. Proteins targeted to other sub-compartments of the mitochondria such as the intermembrane space and inner mitochondrial membrane, contain internal targeting signals, these signals have an indefinable nature and are inconsistent in their pattern. Proteins targeted to the outer membrane also contain internal targeting signals, not {{all of which have}} been identified, and include proteins that take on a β-barrel structure, such as Tom40. Some proteins however, that are targeted to the outer mitochondrial membrane contain a hydrophobic tail domain that anchors the protein to the membrane.|$|E
50|$|Small Tim {{proteins}} are synthesised {{lacking a}} cleavable <b>presequence,</b> but instead containing internal targeting information {{and need to}} be imported to the intermembrane space. The intermembrane space import and assembly machinery (MIA) is believed to mediate transport of the small Tim precursors into the intermembrane space subcompartment. MIA is composed of two main essential cysteine-rich proteins; Mia40 and Erv1. Mia40 is also referred to as Tim40 in yeast and deficiency of Mia40 has been reported to affect import of the small Tims. Mia40 is anchored to the mitochondrial inner membrane via an N-terminal hydrophobic segment, exposing a large domain to the intermembrane space. It contains 6 conserved cysteine residues, which allow the binding of incoming Tim precursor proteins. Following import of small Tim proteins into the intermembrane space Mia40 interacts with small Tim proteins via disulfide bonds. Following isomerisation of the disulfide bridge, the polypeptide is released. Mia40 which is now in reduced state, is then oxidised by Erv1. This oxidation step is vital to facilitate further rounds of precursor protein import. Without Erv1 activity, reduced Mia40 accumulates and is in inactive conformation. Interaction between the incoming precursor proteins, Mia40 and Erv1, is maintained {{as a result of a}} flow of electrons that are transferred from the incoming protein to Mia40 and from reduced Mia40 to oxidised Erv1. Precursors are then released in oxidised state and form disulfide bridges which prevents their escape out of the intermembrane space. Small Tim proteins are then maintained in active conformation within the intermembrane space by Hot13 (helper of Tims). It is possible that Hot13 may have reducing effects on small Tim proteins as they counterbalance the harmful effects that oxidative agents exhibit.|$|E

40|$|Mitochondrial {{processing}} peptidases are heterodimeric enzymes (alpha/betaMPP) {{that play}} {{an essential role}} in mitochondrial biogenesis by recognizing and cleaving the targeting <b>presequences</b> of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins. The two subunits are paralogues that probably evolved by duplication of a gene for a monomeric metallopeptidase from the endosymbiotic ancestor of mitochondria. Here, we characterize the MPP-like proteins from two important human parasites that contain highly reduced versions of mitochondria, the mitosomes of Giardia intestinalis and the hydrogenosomes of Trichomonas vaginalis. Our biochemical characterization of recombinant proteins showed that, contrary to a recent report, the Trichomonas processing peptidase functions efficiently as an alpha/beta heterodimer. By contrast, and so far uniquely among eukaryotes, the Giardia processing peptidase functions as a monomer comprising a single betaMPP-like catalytic subunit. The structure and surface charge distribution of the Giardia processing peptidase predicted from a 3 -D protein model appear to have co-evolved with the properties of Giardia mitosomal targeting sequences, which, unlike classic mitochondrial targeting signals, are typically short and impoverished in positively charged residues. The majority of hydrogenosomal <b>presequences</b> resemble those of mitosomes, but longer, positively charged mitochondrial-type <b>presequences</b> were also identified, consistent with the retention of the Trichomonas alphaMPP-like subunit. Our computational and experimental/functional analyses reveal that the divergent processing peptidases of Giardia mitosomes and Trichomonas hydrogenosomes evolved from the same ancestral heterodimeric alpha/betaMPP metallopeptidase as did the classic mitochondrial enzyme. The unique monomeric structure of the Giardia enzyme, and the co-evolving properties of the Giardia enzyme and substrate, provide a compelling example of the power of reductive evolution to shape parasite biology...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Plastids of diatoms {{and related}} algae evolved by {{secondary}} endocytobiosis, the uptake of a eukaryotic alga into a eukaryotic host cell and its subsequent reduction into an organelle. As a result diatom plastids are sur-rounded by four membranes. Protein targeting of nucleus encoded plastid proteins across these membranes depends on N-terminal bipartite <b>presequences</b> {{consisting of a}} signal and a transit peptide-like domain. Diatoms and crypto-phytes share a conserved amino acid motif of unknown function at the cleavage site of the signal peptides (ASA-FAP), which is particularly important for successful plastid targeting. Screening genomic databases we found that in rare cases the very conserved phenylalanine within the motif may be replaced by tryptophan, tyrosine or leucine. To test such unusual <b>presequences</b> for functionality and {{to better understand the}} role of the motif and putative receptor proteins involved in targeting, we constructed prese-quence:GFP fusion proteins with or without modifications of the ‘‘ASAFAP’’-motif and expressed them in the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum. In this comprehensive muta-tional analysis we found that only the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine, tryptophan, tyrosine and the bulky amino acid leucine at the + 1 position of the predicted signal peptidase cleavage site allow plastid import, as expected from the sequence comparison of native plastid targeting <b>presequences</b> of P. tricornutum and the cryptophyte Guil-lardia theta. Deletions within the signal peptide domains also impaired plastid import, showing that the presence of F at the N-terminus of the transit peptide together with a cleavable signal peptide is crucial for plastid import...|$|R
50|$|Description of {{the human}} {{clinical}} phenotype of an autosomal recessive neuromuscular disorder caused by deficiency of the mitochondrial intermediate <b>presequence</b> protease (MIP), encoded by the gene MIPEP, was first reported by lead author Mohammad Eldomery and senior corresponding author V. Reid Sutton in 2016 in the journal Genome Medicine. The index subject was diagnosed with left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy (LVNC) and Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome at 5 1/2 months of age. In an attempt to identify the etiology of this cardiac phenotype, {{a series of tests}} were performed, including clinical whole exome sequencing. Because the clinical diagnostic laboratory did not identify pathogenic variants in known disease-associated genes, re-analysis of the exome data was performed by Dr. Mohammad Eldomery as part of the Baylor-Johns Hopkins Center for Mendelian Genomics. Biallelic variants were identified in the MIPEP gene, which was known in yeast and other organisms to be important in mitochondrial protein processing. Because LVNC is seen in other mitochondrial disorders, this was considered the best candidate gene. After interrogating the Baylor Genetic Laboratory clinical database and submitting the MIPEP gene to GeneMatcher, four other affected individuals from three families were identified with biallelic variants in MIPEP. In all cases, the phenotype is LVNC with severe hypotonia and developmental delay. All of the affected individuals, {{with the exception of the}} index case, died before 2 years of age from cardiac failure. Seizures and cataracts were also noted in some of the affected individuals. The MIPEP variants included missense variants, stop variants as well as a 1.4 Megabase deletion involving the MIPEP gene. Confirmation of the pathogenicity of these variants in MIPEP was performed in a yeast model system by Nora Vögtle and Chris Meisinger at the University of Freiburg, Germany.|$|E

We now show experimentally that this 'non-amphiphilic' <b>presequence</b> peptide is, in fact, highly amphiphilic as measured by its ability to insert into phospholipid monolayers and to disrupt phospholipid vesicles. This result, and similar tests on three additional artificial presequences (two functionally active and one inactive), revealed that all active presequences were amphiphilic whereas the inactive <b>presequence</b> was non-amphiphilic.

Tim 50 is recruited to the TIM 23 complex via Tim 23 in an interaction that is essentially independent {{of the rest of the}} translocase. We find Tim 50 in close proximity to the intermembrane space side of the TOM complex where it recognizes both types of TIM 23 substrates, those that are to be transported into the matrix and those destined to the inner membrane, suggesting that Tim 50 recognizes <b>presequences.</b> This function of Tim 50 depends on its association with TIM 23.

40|$|The photosystem I (PSI) {{complex in}} higher plants {{contains}} eight nuclear- encoded subunits, of which two (PSI-F and -N) are synthesized with bipartite <b>presequences</b> containing cleavable thylakoid transfer sequences. Previous studies on four other chloroplast proteins bearing bipartite <b>presequences</b> {{have shown that}} they are transported across the thylakoid membrane by two distinct mechanisms. One mechanism is ΔpH-dependent and hence sensitive to uncouplers, whereas the other is inhibited by azide. We show that PSI-F is targeted by the latter pathway, since its translocation across the thylakoid membrane is inhibited by azide but not by nigericin. Translocation is furthermore unaffected {{by the presence of}} high concentrations of the lumenal 23 -kDa photosystem II (PSII) protein, which is known to be transported by the ΔpH-dependent pathway. In contrast, translocation of PSI-N across the thylakoid membrane is completely blocked by saturating concentrations of pre- 23 -kDa protein. Three proteins are now known to be synthesized with thylakoid transfer signals in both higher plants and cyanobacteria (PSI-F, plastocyanin, and the 33 -kDa PSII protein), and all three are transported by the azide-sensitive, possibly see-dependent pathway. In contrast, PSI-N and the 23 -kDa and 16 -kDa PSII proteins (transported by the ΔpH-driven pathway in higher plants) are all absent in cyanobacteria. These data suggest that the ΔpH-dependent translocation mechanism for these proteins may also have arisen relatively recently during the evolution of the chloroplast. Three additional PSI proteins (PSI-H, -K, and -L) are synthesized in the cytosol with stroma-targeting <b>presequences</b> and hence integrate into the thylakoid membrane by means of information in the mature proteins. We show that the integration mechanisms are insensitive to azide in each case, and nigericin causes only a slight inhibition of integration in each case. We therefore suggest that these proteins are targeted into the thylakoid membrane by a separate pathway(s). </p...|$|R
