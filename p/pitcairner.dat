6000|$|... 'I {{mean that}} when some one said, [...] "Do you really mean to place those savage Melanesians among the immaculate Pitcairners?" [...] the natural answer {{seemed to me}} to be, [...] "I am not aware that you ever saw either a <b>Pitcairner</b> or a Melanesian." [...] I thought it rather impertinent. The truth is, that the great {{proportion}} of our Melanesian scholars in our school, i.e., not standing alone, but helped by the discipline of the school, are quite competent to set an example to the average Pitcairners. But this I mark only as an illustration of my meaning. Occasionally I hear of some book or sermon or speech in which sound views (as I venture to call them) are propounded on these points.|$|E

50|$|Since {{the end of}} the Napoleonic wars, the Pitcairn islanders {{had been}} {{discovered}} by and had friendly contact with the Royal Navy and British authorities. In 1830, Tahiti's Queen Pomare IV invited the <b>Pitcairners</b> to return to Tahiti, and in March 1831, a British ship transported them there. The Tahitians welcomed the <b>Pitcairners</b> and offered them land. But having been isolated and not having developed any immunity to the diseases now on Tahiti, the <b>Pitcairners</b> suffered from disease in alarming number. Fourteen of them died. The Tahitians took up a collection for the surviving <b>Pitcairners,</b> and for $500 a whaling captain took them back to Pitcairn.|$|R

50|$|Since the {{introduction}} of aluminium-hulled long-boats in the 20th century, <b>Pitcairners</b> have made regular trips to Henderson to harvest the wood of miro and tou trees. Usually they venture to Henderson once per year, but they may make up to three trips {{if the weather is}} favourable. <b>Pitcairners</b> carve the wood into curios for tourists, from which they derive much of their income.|$|R

40|$|Pitcairn Island was {{uninhabited}} in 1790 {{when the}} mutineers of the Royal Navy's Bounty settled there {{with men and}} women from Tahiti to serve as slaves and wives for the sailors. Murders and accidents claimed the lives the leader of the mutiny, Fletcher Christian, and those of every adult male save John Adams. Adams led the remaining islanders under a benevolent dictatorship {{for the rest of his}} life, a South Seas Christian monarchy cut off from the rest of the world. After the island was rediscovered, new settlers arrived, including a delusional Englishman named Joshua Hill who took over the island and ruled the islanders by fear. After he was removed by the Royal Navy, it supervised the island for decades, its ships regularly visiting the island and its officers writing several simple legal codes for the Pitcairners. The islanders consented as they considered themselves to be English and were fervently loyal to Queen Victoria. The British administration was very light for decades, the islanders largely running their own affairs.   That changed after a <b>Pitcairner</b> murdered two islanders in 1897. The British realized there was no way to try the defendant short of taking him to London. The solution was to place the island under the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific. The High Commissioner was a British official based in Fiji whose job was to bring law and order to a vast swath of the Pacific and suppress the slave trade among the islands. The High Commissioner arranged for a trial for the murderer, who was convicted and hanged. Pitcairn's government operated under the High Commissioner until 1952 and now is run by the British ambassador to New Zealand...|$|E
60|$|Accordingly, on the 4th of July, the 'Southern Cross' again {{approached}} the island, and {{finding that the}} <b>Pitcairners</b> had come, and that their magistrate and Mr. Nobbs, their clergyman, would gladly welcome assistance, the Bishop brought Mrs. Selwyn on shore, and left her there to assist Mr. Nobbs in preparing the entire population to be confirmed on his return. But the <b>Pitcairners</b> have been amply written about, and as Coleridge Patteson's connection with them was only incidental, I shall not dwell on them or their history.|$|R
50|$|Bounty Day {{starts off}} with a re-enactment of the landing of the <b>Pitcairners</b> down at the Kingston Pier. The <b>Pitcairners</b> are greeted by the Administrator and his wife, and from the pier they march to the cenotaph where they lay wreaths in remembrance. From the cenotaph they then march to the {{cemetery}} where hymns are sung. Next, they proceed to Government House where a family surnamed either Quintal, Evans, McCoy, Buffett, Adams, Nobbs, Christian or Young (being descendants of the <b>Pitcairners</b> of that ilk) is awarded the title of 'Family of the Year'. The children roll down the hill in front of Government House, after which the whole procession travels to the Compound where the children play games and partake of a celebratory feast. Finally, everyone returns home {{to prepare for the}} Bounty Ball, at which there is a competition in further celebration of Bounty Day.|$|R
60|$|This was but an {{everyday}} feat of the <b>Pitcairners,</b> who {{went up to}} their village chatting merrily, and thinking nothing more about the adventure than that it was capital fun.|$|R
5000|$|Along with {{a number}} of other <b>Pitcairners,</b> he {{migrated}} to Tahiti in 1831, but having no immunity to the diseases of the island he died on 21 April. At that point he had been [...] "the oldest and perhaps the most respected of the first generation of native born islanders." [...] Eleven other <b>Pitcairners</b> died in the same epidemic. Deprived of leadership, the group left Tahiti on 14 August 1831 to return to Pitcairn facilitated by Captain William Driver. His wife outlived him by 19 years. Thursday's third son was Thursday October Christian II (1820 - 1911).|$|R
6000|$|Meanwhile the <b>Pitcairners,</b> knowing that, {{even at the}} shortest, a long, {{long time}} must pass before Folger could {{communicate}} with the [...] "old country," [...] continued the even tenor of their innocent lives.|$|R
50|$|Crown {{prosecutors}} produced numerous old {{documents to}} refute the defence that British law {{had never been}} enforced on Pitcairn, or that the <b>Pitcairners</b> had never known that they were subject to it. According to the documents, the islanders had, {{over a period of}} many years, sought British advice and intervention in cases related to adultery, abortion, kleptomania, attempted murder (including a 1936 case in which a husband and wife tried to kill each other), and the theft of women's underwear. Crown Prosecutor Simon Mount said the charges had been referred to British authorities because they were too serious to be dealt with locally, and proved that <b>Pitcairners</b> were fully aware of British law and of its applicability to them.|$|R
50|$|In 1886 the Seventh-day Adventist layman John Tay {{visited the}} island and persuaded most of the islanders to accept his faith. He {{returned}} in 1890 on the missionary schooner Pitcairn with an ordained minister to perform baptisms. Since then, the majority of <b>Pitcairners</b> have been Adventists.|$|R
5000|$|Many <b>Pitcairners</b> felt unfairly treated; for instance, Mike Warren {{said the}} whole trial was a [...] "setup" [...] from the start. Former Pitcairn {{resident}} Reeve Cooze expressed {{the sentiments of}} many islanders on Radio New Zealand when he declared, [...] "The Pitcairn people have been bullied." ...|$|R
6000|$|But he {{soon found}} out that the mental {{capacity}} of the <b>Pitcairners</b> was like a bottomless pit. However much they got, they wanted more. Anecdote after anecdote, story after story, fact after fact, was thrown into the gulf, and still the cry was, [...] "More! more!" ...|$|R
6000|$|In {{a report}} from the chief magistrate, we learn that, {{although}} still out of the beaten track of commerce, the <b>Pitcairners</b> are more frequently visited by whalers than they used to be. Their simplicity of life, manners, and piety appears to be unchanged. He says, among other things:-- ...|$|R
60|$|But {{the loose}} manners and evil habits {{of many of}} the people there had such an effect on the <b>Pitcairners</b> that they took the first {{opportunity}} of returning to their much-loved island. John Buffett and a few families went first. The remainder soon followed in an American brig.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Pitcairners</b> {{occupied}} many of {{the buildings}} remaining from the penal settlements, and gradually established their traditional farming and whaling industries on the island. Although some families {{decided to return to}} Pitcairn in 1858 and 1863, the island's population continued to slowly grow as the island accepted settlers, often arriving with whaling fleets.|$|R
60|$|As {{soon as the}} 'Southern Cross' {{had carried}} Bishop Harper back to Lyttelton, the Melanesian voyage was recommenced, {{this time with a}} {{valuable}} assistant in Mr. Benjamin Dudley. Mrs. Selwyn was again dropped at Norfolk Island, and five young <b>Pitcairners</b> were taken on board to serve as a boat's crew, and also to receive instruction.|$|R
5000|$|Bounty Day is the {{national}} holiday of Norfolk Island, celebrated annually on 8 June, {{in memory of the}} arrival of the Pitcairn Islanders on Norfolk Island in 1856. [...] Prior to 8 June 1856, Norfolk Island had been a penal colony, but the <b>Pitcairners</b> received land grants (from Queen Victoria) upon their arrival at Norfolk Island in 1856.|$|R
5000|$|... the 2014 government's Pitcairn Islands Economic Report {{stated that}} [...] " [...] will migrate to Pitcairn Islands for {{economic}} reasons as there are limited government jobs, a lack of private sector employment, as well as considerable competition for the tourism dollar". The <b>Pitcairners</b> take tourists in turns to accommodate those few tourists who occasionally visit the island.|$|R
6000|$|... 'On Sunday, {{the early}} Chapel is omitted. The full Liturgy {{is divided into}} two services--I forget the laws--and a kind of sermon in Mota is given; and in the afternoon, the Bishop, or one of the ordained members of the Mission, usually goes down to the town to relieve Mr. Nobbs in his service for the <b>Pitcairners.</b>|$|R
60|$|On October 2, Norfolk Island was reached, and there, {{a wooden}} house having been {{conveyed}} thither by H.M.S. 'Falcon,' Mr. Palmer and fifteen scholars were placed {{to spend the}} winter. The <b>Pitcairners</b> welcomed the Mission, but were displeased at the Government assuming a right {{to dispose of the}} land which they had fancied entirely their own.|$|R
6000|$|The wedding-day {{was a day}} {{of great}} rejoicing, {{considerable}} solemnity, and not a little fun; for {{the religion of the}} <b>Pitcairners,</b> being drawn direct from the inspired Word, was the reverse of dolorous. Indeed, the simplicity of their faith was extreme, for it consisted in merely asking the question, [...] "What does God wish me to do?" [...] and doing it.|$|R
500|$|Under the 1893 Pacific Order in Council, Pitcairn Island was {{governed by}} the High Commissioner of the British Western Pacific Territories in Fiji. On 19 December 1902, {{commissioned}} by R. T. Simmons, the British Consul in Tahiti, Captain G. F. Jones {{and a group of}} <b>Pitcairners</b> visited the nearby islands and annexed them to the United Kingdom. In 1903 Ducie was annexed by the same procedure and placed under the authority of the Western Pacific High Commissioner. [...] R. T. Simmons stated in a dispatch to the Foreign Office that James Russell McCoy had assured him that the islands had always been considered as dependencies of Pitcairn, and that he and other <b>Pitcairners</b> had frequently visited them in the past. This claim is contested by Donald McLoughlin on grounds of the distance between Pitcairn Island and Ducie Island and the lack of a suitable boat to navigate the distance between the two, casting doubt on whether they had ever visited Ducie.|$|R
50|$|On 8 June 1956, {{was issued}} the first {{commemorative}} stamp marking the centenary of {{the arrival of}} <b>Pitcairners,</b> the first permanent and non penal settlement on Norfolk. The second commemorative needed to overprint the Australian stamp for the 150 years of postal service in Australia picturing Isaac Nichols, the first postmaster of New South Wales. Worth four pence in Australia, it was overprinted five pence for use in Norfolk.|$|R
50|$|Most {{resident}} Pitcairn Islanders are {{descendants of}} the Bounty mutineers and Tahitians (or other Polynesians). Pitkern is a creole language derived from 18th-century English, with elements of the Tahitian language. It is spoken as a first language by the population and is taught alongside English at the island's only school. It {{is closely related to}} the creole language Norfuk, spoken on Norfolk Island, because Norfolk was repopulated in the mid-19th century by <b>Pitcairners.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Betty Christian, the Island Secretary, broke {{ranks with}} many of her fellow <b>Pitcairners,</b> testifying at the Pitcairn Supreme Court hearing in Papakura that the islanders were aware that they were British {{subjects}} and that British law was applicable to them. She also flatly contradicted the defence that sexual activity {{at a young age}} was considered [...] "normal" [...] on Pitcairn, saying that Pitcairn's values were no different from those of any other modern society.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Beef tea, chicken broth, mutton broth, wine, brandy, milk to any extent, rice, &c.--Palmer {{manufactures}} all. The <b>Pitcairners,</b> most improvident people, {{are short}} of all necessary stores. I give what I can, but I must be stingy, as I tell them, for I never anticipated {{an attack of}} typhus here. They will, I trust, learn a lesson from it, and not provoke a recurrence of it by {{going on in their}} old ways.|$|R
