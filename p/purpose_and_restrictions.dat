40|$|The {{purpose of}} this piece is to provide {{commentary}} of an article, Child Welfare Waivers: The Stakes for Your State, that discusses the recent reauthorization of the Title IV-E Child Welfare Waivers. The article {{provides an overview of}} funds available to the states for child welfare programs and their intended <b>purpose</b> <b>and</b> <b>restrictions</b> placed on use. As structured, the present system rewards states monetarily for maintaining foster care. Research from waiver programs shows promising results for improved outcomes at the same or lower financial cost by utilizing safe, proven alternatives to the current foster care system. Waiver funds also protect the financial commitment to child welfare because state legislative budget slashing in this area will result in the loss of Federal funding. The independent analysis required with the grant of a waiver must be maintained to provide ongoing analysis and oversight of the increase spending flexibility. Stakeholders must be aware of the program and its results and use these funds as an opportunity to assess new concepts and apply programs best suited to the needs of children in their state. Allowing those “on the ground” to determine appropriate programming and careful result assessment may be the best means for protecting children, preserving families and doing both in a manner that makes the most efficient use of available resources...|$|E

Recent efforts to extend some or all of these tax benefits to for-profit companies making social investments, including the creation of the new hybrid nonprofit/for-profit company form known as the Low-Profit Limited Liability Company, threaten to undermine the vitality of the nonprofit sector and the integrity of the tax system. Reform advocates maintain that the ability to compensate executives based on performance and to distribute profits when attractive investment opportunities are scarce makes for-profit entities more efficient than nonprofit counterparts. Offering more favorable tax treatment to for-profits engaging in charity would encourage greater charitable entrepreneurship, the argument goes, and provide worthwhile competition for the nonprofit sector As matters stand, however, nonprofits can and occasionally do reward executives with performance-based compensation, and their nondistribution rules impose no obligation to make subpar investments. The existing nonprofit sector is extremely competitive, and the charitable activities of for-profits already receive favorable tax treatment. Going further and offering socially active for-profits the tax benefits equivalent to those available currently to nonprofits would create opportunities for tax arbitrage by providing tax deductions to high-bracket donors and taxable income for lightly taxed recipients. The difficulty of policing lines between nonprofit and for-profit activities of the same business entities would entail significant administrative complexity and is unlikely ultimately to succeed. And even should it succeed, the costs of offering new tax benefits to for-profit charities include not only foregone tax revenues, but also spillover effects on the charitable activities of nonprofits...|$|R

40|$|This {{report is}} a degree project {{performed}} at Freudenberg Household Products AB, (FHP). The degree project comprises measurement {{and analysis of}} the power net at FHP Basproduction. The content is divided between one theory-part, one document- part with measurements and also conclusions and a list of measures to be taken. During the project the <b>purpose</b> <b>and</b> <b>restriction</b> change from a quality investigation to only concentrate on harmonics and finding the reason why they exist, and also to find {{a solution to the problem}} with harmonics. The measurements shows that the power net contains harmonics of different order and intensity. High harmonic rate is found under the transformer T- 7. The problem with harmonics was not known earlier and therefore it can be assumed that there are more built-in frequency converters without filter in pumps, compressors and machines in the whole net. After a number of measurements one can suppose that some parts of the FHP power net is unstable. In an unstable weak power net frequency converters produce a large number of harmonics. In all the cases where large numbers of harmonics have been detected the trace has ended in a power central where a pump, compressor or heating element is. Worth to be noticed is that under the same transformer there are strip lights, converters and control electronics. The conclusion is that measures against harmonics are possible and necessary to do in most cases. The measures should be made local, as close to the disturbing object as possible, to stop the disturbance to get out in the net. The aim is that the current should stay sinus. The purpose with the project could not be fulfilled because the report do not tell about how serious the high number of current harmonics are for running the factory. The opinion is that the harmonics should be reduced to a lower level...|$|R

Members of the Hutterian Brethren objected on religious grounds to having their photos taken and challenged {{the constitutionality of the}} photo requirement. In the Hutterian Brethren case, a majority of the Supreme Court of Canada held that the photo requirement breached section 2 (a) of the Charter but was justified under section 1. The majority adopted a weak standard of justification under section 1. A restriction will be justified as long as the law has a legitimate <b>purpose</b> <b>and</b> the <b>restriction</b> is necessary to advance that purpose. The majority’s adoption of this weak standard of justification under section 1 reflects the Court’s ambivalence about the state’s duty to compromise its policies to make space for religious practices and more deeply about the nature of religious belief and its place in the public life of the community. While it may sometimes be useful to treat religion as separate from politics, the insulation (and exclusion) of religion from public decision-making will inevitably be partial and pragmatic. Accommodation will occur at the margins of law, and will involve only minor trade-offs that do not significantly affect public policies...|$|R
40|$|Scientific publications, {{legislation}} on spatial planning in Ukraine and spatial planning in Austria are analysed. Ukrainian spatial planning system {{is divided into}} urban planning and land management planning. According to the Law of Ukraine "On regulation of urban development" urban planning documentation is developed for: the entire territory of Ukraine, the region (a part of Ukraine’s territory) and as well for settlements and their parts. According to the Law of Ukraine "On Land Management" most land management documents are developed on the local level. Only two types of land management documentation are developedon the regional level, namely: a) land management schemes and feasibility studies of land use and land protection of administrative units; b) land management projects for the establishment (changing) of the boundaries of administrative units. Such projects as land management projects on ordering the territory for urban needs and land management projects on ordering the residential areas are developed on the local level. Other land management documentation is developed for a particular land parcel (setting boundaries, separation, change of <b>purpose</b> <b>and</b> so on.), or has a narrow specialization (area organization of agricultural land parcels, or providing the environmental and economic assessment of crop rotation). It’s found that almost all planning tolls belong to urban planning. Austrian spatial planning has three levels with clear division of competences in all areas. Planning occurs {{at the level of}} the federal government, the federal land and the community. Also nominal spatial planning and professional planning in various fields, which has a significant impact on the environment is defined. Analysis of planning competencies at various levels shows that the lower the level of planning, the higher competence in nominal spatial planning and the lower in professional planning. At first a concept of local development which contains the ideas and goals of development without a clear spatial reference (so-called vision of future) is developed. Based on this concept a plan for targeted purposes is developed. It clearly defines the boundaries of land parcelswith appropriate purpose. The next step is to make a plan of development for areas that are designated for residential, public or industrial building. This plan put <b>restrictions</b> <b>and</b> requirements for newbuildings,namely for their superficiality, compactness, density and possible use. Like the planning hierarchy, there is also a hierarchy of planning and cartographic materials of all planning levels. During the process of comparing the approaches to spatial planning in Austria and spatial planning in Ukraine was found that the spatial planning system of Ukraine requires conceptual changes. Therefore, it is proposed to upgrade the system of spatial planning to a hierarchical system, to refuse from separation of urbanplanning and spatial planning and land management and to update the tolls of this process at the local level (at the level of local communities). It is proposed instead of the Master Plan of settlement, which in the present conditions of land relations reforming is not able to ensure the effective planning processes to implement a plan for target <b>purposes</b> <b>and</b> <b>restrictions</b> for the entire community and to develop on this basis detailed plans for areas designated for built up. This approach will provide a unified system of spatial planning for the successful development of both urban and rural communities...|$|R
40|$|Background: Gardening is an {{activity}} {{of daily living}} {{that can be a}} source of pride, or embarrassment. People will go without essentials to pay a gardener rather than upset the neighbours with a scruffy garden, or attract unwelcome visitors (Richards 2006). This study aims to explore individual's reaction to the lived or anticipated experience of losing a garden using a qualitative methodology. Methods: Data was collated from the Mass Observation Archive. This study utilises responses from the directive entitled ‘You and Gardens' 2007. Thematic analysis was applied to a purposive sample of 103 participants. Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the University of Brighton's School Research Ethics and Governance Panel. Results: This research highlights four themes: relief, bereavement of place, <b>purpose</b> <b>and</b> product; <b>restriction</b> coping strategies. These findings support the current literature and the concept of occupational deprivation Conclusion: Exploring the effects of not having access to a garden enables occupational therapists to deeply understand the meanings held by the lost garden space. This research also highlights concerns raised by the potential loss of this private, precious space before it happens. Overall the practical relocation of individuals away from their gardens raises the notion of occupational justice and the role of gardens in providing an equal and fair society. Private gardens provide a free medium for occupational therapy intervention, this has the potential to reduce strain on an overstretched healthcare budget. whilst enabling people to manage things they no longer felt possible...|$|R
40|$|The need to {{cope with}} the {{mobility}} of users is very different between mobile and fixed communication systems. Mobility management is thus a key feature in the design of mobile systems. Techniques derived for terrestrial mobile systems cannot be used for mobile satellite systems that use constellations of satellites. A major theme of this thesis is the proposal and verification of such mobility management schemes for mobile satellite systems. Mobility management consists of location tracking, location area planning, positioning, location update method, paging method, signalling over air-interface and call set-up delay. New proposals are made for location updating, paging, positioning and database architectures for mobile satellite systems in this thesis. A method of implementing intelligent paging in mobile satellite systems is outlined and a method of finding optimal location area considering both air-interface and fixed network resources is explained. It is also demonstrated how the new schemes save on signalling load in the airinterface and fixed network, satellite power, terminal power, and reduce the size of the terminal and call set-up delay. As a basis for the above research work, features of different satellite constellations are explained with their ground tracking pattern and orbit type. The requirements of the constellation for communication <b>purposes</b> <b>and</b> the <b>restrictions</b> involved in achieving them are outlined. Comparison of different satellite constellation is also made. As the networking architecture and signalling of mobile satellite systems are based on the GSM terrestrial network, a background explanation is presented for completeness...|$|R

40|$|Rules, bans, {{restrictions}} in healthcare facilities Improving {{the quality of}} care for patients is the main goal of every healthcare facility. Satisfaction of patients with medical and nursing care is one of the indicators of quality. Patients have not only rights but also duties. Among other things, patients duties include compliance with rules, bans <b>and</b> <b>restrictions</b> during a visit to healthcare facilities. This particularly concerns compliance with therapeutic rules, instructions given by a physician and other limitations associated with the operation of a healthcare facility. The main objective of this diploma thesis was to identify the patients attitude and perception of rules, bans, <b>and</b> <b>restrictions,</b> find out how patients observe them and compare the number of rules, bans <b>and</b> <b>restrictions</b> in both outpatient and inpatient healthcare facilities. The data was collected in a survey undertaken in Nemocnice s poliklinikou Praha Italská (Hospital with Outpatient Clinic Prague Italska). This healthcare facility has 2 hospital wards and 31 specialist outpatient departments. A total of 188 respondents took part in the survey (102 outpatients and 86 inpatients). Five hypotheses were proposed. The first hypothesis, which predicted that most patients would perceive rules, bans <b>and</b> <b>restrictions</b> as burden, was not confirmed. The second hypothesis, which predicted that rules, bans <b>and</b> <b>restrictions</b> that were personal would create more stress in female patients than in male patients, was confirmed. The third hypothesis was also confirmed since female patients from outpatient departments of the healthcare facility were shown to be more compliant with rules, bans <b>and</b> <b>restrictions</b> than male patients. Female inpatients from hospital wards of the healthcare facility were not more compliant with rules, bans <b>and</b> <b>restrictions</b> than male inpatients. The fourth hypothesis was not therefore confirmed. Our assumption that inpatients from hospital wards of the healthcare facility are facing more rules, bans <b>and</b> <b>restrictions</b> than outpatients was disproved. The fifth hypothesis was not therefore confirmed. The author has chosen this topic for her diploma thesis because as a nurse she meets different kinds of patients on a daily basis who react differently to rules, bans <b>and</b> <b>restrictions</b> in this healthcare facility. The results of the survey led us to design training classes for nurses and information brochures for patients who visit healthcare facilities. A sufficient amount of information is a basic prerequisite for understanding and complying with rules, bans <b>and</b> <b>restrictions...</b>|$|R
