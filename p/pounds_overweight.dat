25|$|During World War II, Gleason was {{initially}} exempt from military service, {{since he was}} a father of two. However, in 1943 the US started drafting men with children. Gleason reported to his induction where the doctors discovered that his broken left arm had healed crooked, the area between his thumb and forefinger was nerveless and numb, a pilonidal cyst existed {{at the end of his}} coccyx, and that he was 100 <b>pounds</b> <b>overweight.</b> Gleason was therefore classified 4-F, and rejected for military service.|$|E
25|$|In {{a widely}} {{unexpected}} move, Clarett was drafted {{on the first}} day of the 2005 NFL Draft with the final pick of the 3rd round (#101 overall) by the Denver Broncos. Many experts felt that he would fall to the 6th or 7th round, if he was drafted at all. However, Clarett turned out to be unimpressive in the Denver Broncos' preseason training camp. In part due to having not played a game in two years or practiced in over a year, he entered training camp weighing 248 pounds, more than 20 <b>pounds</b> <b>overweight.</b> He was also slow to recover from an injury.|$|E
25|$|Boyd's lack {{of first}} team {{appearances}} prompted the newly appointed Hartlepool manager Neale Cooper to loan him to Boston United to gain match practice. During {{his time at}} Boston, Boyd won critical acclaim from Boston manager Neil Thompson and played a total of 14 matches scoring four goals before returning to Hartlepool. Boyd returned nine <b>pounds</b> <b>overweight</b> and looked set to leave Hartlepool United after angering Cooper. When asked about his weight gain, Boyd claimed {{that he had been}} eating more to build up his strength but when asked about gym work he said he had not started it yet. Boston looked set to make permanent deal for Boyd and made an offer for the striker. However, both teams failed to reach an agreement with Boston claiming that Hartlepool were asking far too much. It was rumoured that Hartlepool chairman, Ken Hodcroft, wanted a five figure sum, but Boston were only prepared to pay a four figure amount of around £5,000.|$|E
5000|$|He then faced Jorge Masvidal at Shark Fights 13: Jardine vs. Prangley in September 2010, and won via {{unanimous}} decision. Before the fight, {{he weighed}} in {{three-quarters of a}} <b>pound</b> <b>overweight</b> {{and was forced to}} give up 15% of his [...] "show purse".|$|R
5000|$|Benny Valgar, {{frequently}} spelled [...] "Valger", won the Featherweight Boxing Championship of {{the world}} in the resounding decision of newspapers on February 25, 1920. However, he did not knockout Johnny Kilbane, the reigning champion, so by previous agreement, could not take the title. Other sources observed that Valgar forfeited the match because he was less than a <b>pound</b> <b>overweight</b> from the featherweight limit of 124 pounds. Kilbane could have waved the forfeit, but chose not to.|$|R
50|$|On June 12, 1900, {{defeated}} Tommy White at the Seaside Sporting Club in {{a decisive}} third round knockout in Brooklyn, New York. After {{two minutes of}} fighting in the first round, the electric lighting in the club went out, nearly causing a panic among the crowd. Ten minutes later the lights went on again and the fighting resumed. An attendant fan, Frank Conlin, kept the crowd sedate by whistling a series of tunes. White was seriously outclassed in the battle, as he was knocked down once in the first round, twice in the second, and {{four times in the}} third. McGovern made no objection to White being 1/2 <b>pound</b> <b>overweight</b> at weigh in. Referee Johnny White did a full ten count against White in the third round to end the bout.|$|R
500|$|Wilson's {{success in}} the 1930 season served only to fuel his {{drinking}} habits, and in 1931 he reported to spring training 20 <b>pounds</b> <b>overweight.</b> In addition, the NL responded to the prodigious offensive statistics {{of the previous year}} (the only season, other than 1894, in which the league as a whole batted over [...]300) by introducing a heavier ball with raised stitching to allow pitchers to gain a better grip and throw sharper curveballs. Wilson complained that the new Cubs manager, former teammate Rogers Hornsby, did not allow him to [...] "swing away" [...] as much as Joe McCarthy had. He hit his 200th career home run at Ebbets Field on June 18 — only the fourth player ever to do so, behind Ruth, Cy Williams, and Hornsby — but then fell into a protracted slump, and was benched in late May. By late August Wrigley publicly expressed his desire to trade him. On September 6 he was suspended without pay {{for the remainder of the}} season after a fight with reporters aboard a train in Cincinnati. He was hitting [...]261 with only 13 home runs (his 1930 production during August alone) at the time.|$|E
500|$|However, in the 1968–69 season, Russell {{seemed to}} reach a {{breaking}} point. Shocked by the murder of Robert F. Kennedy, disillusioned by the Vietnam War, and weary from his increasingly stale (and later divorced) marriage to his wife Rose, {{he was convinced that}} the U.S. was a corrupt nation and that he was wasting his time playing something as superficial as basketball. He was 15 <b>pounds</b> <b>overweight,</b> skipped mandatory NBA coach meetings and was generally lacking energy: after a New York Knicks game, he complained of intense pain and was diagnosed with acute exhaustion. Russell pulled himself together and put up 9.9 points and 19.3 rebounds per game, but the aging Celtics stumbled through the regular season. Their 48–34 record was the team's worst since 1955–56, and they entered the playoffs as only the fourth-seeded team in the East. In the playoffs, however, Russell and his Celtics achieved upsets over the Philadelphia 76ers and New York Knicks to earn a meeting with the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Finals. L.A. now featured new recruit Wilt Chamberlain next to perennial stars Baylor and West, and were heavily favored. In the first two games, Russell ordered not to double-team West, who used the freedom to score 53 and 41 points in the Game 1 and 2 Laker wins. Russell then ordered to double-team West, and Boston won Game 3. In Game 4, the Celtics were trailing by one point with seven seconds left and the Lakers having the ball, but then Baylor stepped out of bounds, and in the last play, Sam Jones used a triple screen by Bailey Howell, Larry Siegfried and Havlicek and hit a buzzer beater which equalized the series. The teams split the next two games, so it all came down to Game 7 in L.A., where Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke angered and motivated the Celtics by putting [...] "proceedings of Lakers victory ceremony" [...] on the game leaflets. Russell used a copy as extra motivation and told his team to play a running game, because in that case, not the better, but the more determined team was going to win.|$|E
2500|$|Like Robinson and {{the other}} black athletes he had covered, Lacy {{encountered}} racist indignities and hardships. He was barred from press boxes at certain ballparks, dined at the same segregated restaurants with Jackie, and stayed at the same [...] "blacks only" [...] boarding houses as Robinson. Robinson would eventually break MLB's color barrier in 1947 with the Dodgers, but Lacy never allowed their racial bond to cloud his journalistic objectivity. During spring training in 1948, Lacy chastised Robinson in print for arriving 15 <b>pounds</b> <b>overweight,</b> his [...] "lackadaisical attitude" [...] and for [...] "laying down" [...] on the job. He also plastered details of Robinson's personal life throughout his articles, including the dining, shopping, wardrobe and travel habits of Jackie and his wife, Rachel.|$|E
5000|$|Goodrich began a {{professional}} career in boxing by 1918, winning {{a string of}} his early fights, mostly short bouts in the Buffalo area. One of his few early losses was to Johnny McCoy, on May 6, 1919. McCoy would become World Flyweight Champion in October 1927. Some of the better boxers Goodrich met in his early career included Benny Valgar, Johnny Dundee, Frankie Callahan, and Louis [...] "Kid" [...] Kaplan. Of these, he beat only Frankie Callahan on April 2, 1923 in Buffalo. Significantly, in his first match with Johnny Dundee on April 4, 1922, in the Civic Arena in Toronto, he lost in a ten round split decision. The fight was intended {{to have been a}} Jr. Lightweight World Championship except that Goodrich was one <b>pound</b> <b>overweight,</b> disqualifying him from Jr. Lightweight status. The fight was close, and could be considered Goodrich's first bout as a contender.|$|R
5000|$|In 1942, U.S. {{physiologist}} A. J. Carlson suggested levying a fee on each <b>pound</b> of <b>overweight,</b> both {{to counter}} an [...] "injurious luxury" [...] {{and to make}} more food available for the war effort. The concept was reintroduced by Milton Merryweather and P. Franklin Alexander in the late 1970s, but became {{well known in the}} early 1980s by Kelly D. Brownell, director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale. Brownell proposed that revenue from junk food taxes be used to subsidize more healthful foods and fund nutrition campaigns.|$|R
5000|$|Traded to the Mariners {{after the}} [...] season, {{he arrived at}} spring {{training}} the following year 30 <b>pounds</b> (14 kg) <b>overweight</b> and hit only nine homers that year while batting [...]286. He had a resurgence in two seasons with the Reds, batting [...]341 with 19 HRs and 64 RBI in just 323 at-bats in 1993 and [...]323 with 30 HR and 77 RBI in the strike-shortened season. However, his weight problems kept him from being more productive. Because of the baseball strike, he opted {{to play for the}} Fukuoka Daiei Hawks in Japan the following year, where he became the highest-paid player in Japanese history. In Japan, he incurred the displeasure of team management when he chose to travel to the U.S. in mid-season for treatment of knee problems against the team's wishes.|$|R
6000|$|Indignation at the {{injustice}} of Fate in causing her to give her heart to a man and then changing him into another and quite different man fought with a cold terror, which grew as she realized more and more clearly {{the magnitude of the}} mistake she had made. She felt that she must escape. And yet how could she escape? She had definitely pledged herself to this man. ("Ah!" [...] cried Geoffrey gaily, as the pats of butter arrived. [...] "That's more like it!" [...] He began to smear the toast. Maud averted her eyes.) She had told him that she loved him, that he was the whole world to her, that there never would be anyone else. He had come to claim her. How could she refuse him just because he was about thirty <b>pounds</b> <b>overweight?</b> ...|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} with the walk-and-turn test {{is that some of}} the signs of alcohol impairment may stem from other physical problems. Along with that, there are other signs of physical impairment that can stem from various causes, including fatigue, an injury or illness, and nervousness. Those who are physically inactive, elderly, or obese may have trouble completing the walk-and-turn test without flaw. The NTSA used to say that those who are 50 <b>pounds</b> or more <b>overweight</b> may have difficulty performing the test, and that the suspect must walk along a real line. “Later NHTSA manuals removed the weight comment, and also inserted the phrase ‘imaginary line’ at the instruction phase, even though original research always used a visible line”. [...] The fact that officers are no longer required to provide a line for the suspect to walk along may affect the outcome of the test, and often adds to the scrutiny received from critics.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} aspects of a DUI stop is the field sobriety test (FSTs). The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has developed a model system for managing Standardized Field Sobriety Test (SFST) training. They have published numerous training manuals associated with FSTs. As a result of the NHTSA studies, the walk-and-turn test was determined to be 68% accurate, and the one-leg stand test is only 65% accurate when administered to people within the study parameters. The tests were not validated for people with medical conditions, injuries, 65 years or older, and 50 <b>pounds</b> or greater <b>overweight.</b> The officer will administer one or more field sobriety tests. FSTs are considered [...] "divided attention tests" [...] that test the suspect's ability to perform the type of mental and physical multitasking that is required to operate an automobile. However, these tests can be problematic for people with non-obvious disabilities affecting proprioception, such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.|$|R
