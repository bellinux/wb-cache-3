With the <b>production</b> line <b>testing</b> <b>requirement</b> of the {{micro-motor}} rotor {{which is}} less than 10 mm in diameter, an improved rotor detection method based on the pulse test method was presented for the rotor fault detection. This paper analyzed the operating principle of the method and simulated on the Matlab platform. Moreover, the rotor detection system centered on the DSP processor was designed to detect the rotor fault. The result showed that the method could quickly and accurately detect the inter-turn short circuit fault and determine the deep of short circuit. The degree of detection is up to 4 % level, which meets the actual <b>production</b> <b>testing</b> <b>requirement...</b>|$|R

From the perspectives of both consumers and manufacturers, the right product will likely depend on the cost of the materials involved in its <b>production.</b> Consequently, <b>test</b> control <b>requirements</b> are very high. The minimum price of the product is constant and dependent on the products effectiveness or efficiency. The exchange of a defective product for a fully functional one is possible only with the payment of insurance.|$|R

40|$|As modern digital hardware/software systems {{become more}} complex, {{the testing of}} these systems {{throughout}} their entire system life cycle, including design verification, <b>production</b> <b>testing,</b> and field testing, becomes a severe problem. In this paper a structured approach is presented {{to solve the problems}} of system-level testability. A strategy towards design for system-level testability is introduced, which consists of partitioning the system specification into testable parts, and inserting implementation-independent test functionality in the specification. Incorporating these <b>test</b> <b>requirements</b> in the hardware/software implementation will considerably improve system-level testability. The design and implementation of a traffic-lights control system is presented as an example to illustrate the benefits of this approac...|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the Advanced Diesel Engine Component Development (ADECD) Program {{to develop and}} demonstrate critical technology needed to advance the heavy-duty low heat rejection engine concept. Major development activities reported are the design, analysis, and fabrication of monolithic ceramic components; vapor phase and solid film lubrication; electrohydraulic valve actuation; and high pressure common rail injection. An advanced single cylinder test bed was fabricated as a laboratory tool in studying these advanced technologies. This test bed simulates the reciprocator for a system having no cooling system, turbo compounding, Rankine bottoming cycle, common rail injection, and variable valve actuation to achieve fuel consumption of 160 g/kW-hr (. 26 lb/hp-hr). The advanced concepts were successfully integrated into the test engine. All ceramic components met their functional and reliability requirements. The firedeck, cast-in-place ports, valves, valve guides, piston cap, and piston ring were made from silicon nitride. Breakthroughs required to implement a 'ceramic' engine included the fabrication of air-gap cylinder heads, elimination of compression gaskets, machining of ceramic valve seats within the ceramic firedeck, fabrication of cast-in-place ceramic port liners, implementation of vapor phase lubrication, and elimination of the engine coolant system. Silicon nitride valves were successfully developed to meet several <b>production</b> abuse <b>test</b> <b>requirements</b> and incorporated into the test bed with a ceramic valve guide and solid film lubrication. The ADECD cylinder head features ceramic port shields to increase insulation and exhaust energy recovery. The combustion chamber includes a ceramic firedeck and piston cap. The tribological challenge posed by top ring reversal temperatures of 550 C was met {{through the development of}} vapor phase lubrication using tricresyl phosphate at the ring-liner interface. A solenoid-controlled, variable valve actuation system that eliminated the conventional camshaft was demonstrated on the test bed. High pressure fuel injection via a common rail system was also developed to reduce particulate emissions...|$|R

40|$|Standard <b>production</b> <b>test</b> {{techniques}} for ADC require an ATE with an arbitrary waveform generator (AWG) with a resolution at least 2 [*]bits {{higher than the}} ADC under <b>test</b> resolution. This <b>requirement</b> is a real issue for the new high-performance ADCs. This paper proposes a test solution that relaxes this constraint. The technique allows the test of ADC harmonic distortions using only low-cost ATE. The method involves two steps. The first step, called the learning phase, consists in extracting the harmonic contributions from the AWG. These characteristics are then used during the second step, called the <b>production</b> <b>test,</b> to discriminate the harmonic distortions induced by the ADC under test from the ones created by the generator. Hardware experimentations are presented to validate the proposed approach...|$|R

The interface between PBIST, which is internal to the processor, and the external tester environment is through the standard JTAG TAP controller pins. Algorithms and controls are fed into the chip through the TAP controller’s Test Data Input (TDI) pin. The final result of the PBIST test is read out through the Test Data Output (TDO) pin. PBIST supports the entire algorithmic memory <b>testing</b> <b>requirements</b> imposed by the <b>production</b> <b>testing</b> methodology.
