40|$|Linear {{regulators}} usually trade efficiency for simplicity. There {{is always}} an added power loss equal to the input-out-put voltage differential across the regulator times the load current passing through it.

With a single pulse-width modulated control system, how can the control loop be configured to keep all outputs in regulation when each may have varying loads?

40|$|APPLICABILITY: This Temporary Instruction (TI) {{applies to}} all holders of {{operating}} licenses for nuclear power reactors, except nuclear power reactors that have permanently ceased operations and have certified that fuel has been permanently removed from the reactor vessel. 2515 / 165 - 01 OBJECTIVE The objective of this TI is to gather information to support the assessment of nuclear power plant (NPP) operational readiness of offsite power (OSP) systems and impact on plant risk in accordance with NRC requirements prescribed in Plant Technical Specifications and 10 CFR 50. 65 (a) (4), ARequirements for monitoring the effectiveness of maintenance at nuclear power plants. @ 2515 / 165 - 02 BACKGROUND The loss of all alternating current (AC) power at NPPs involves the loss of offsite power (LOOP) combined {{with the loss of}} the onsite emergency <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> (typically emergency diesel generators (EDGs)). This is also referred to as a station blackout (SBO). Risk analyses performed for NPPs indicate that the loss of all AC power can be a significant contributor to the core damage frequency. Although NPPs are designed to cope with a LOOP event through the use of onsite <b>power</b> <b>supplies,</b> <b>LOOP</b> events are considered to be precursors to a SBO. An increase in the frequency or duration of LOOP events increases the risk of core damage. The NRC has been evaluating the reliability of offsite power for NPPs {{over the last several years}} as a result of the changes in the operation of the surrounding electrical power grids due to deregulation and other legislative and economic forces.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} continuous adaptive tuning of digitally controlled switched-mode <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> (SMPS) feedback <b>loops.</b> Tuning is performed via a multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) control loop that adjusts compensator parameters such that crossover frequency and phase margin measured by the digital controller match desired values. A design procedure for the adaptive tuning system is proposed which simplifies the small-signal MIMO design into two independent single-input, single-output (SISO) control loops. The adaptive tuning algorithm is further extended to account for large-signal changes from continuous conduction mode (CCM) to discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) and vice-versa.

40|$|There is a {{high demand}} for {{high-performance}} tuners to meet the digital video broadcasting-terrestrial (DVB-T) standard. Often the DVB-T tuners employ a double-conversion zero-IF (DZIF) architecture that demands a wideband fractional-N synthesizer as the first local oscillator (LO 1) to cover the frequency range of 975 to 1960 MHz. This LO 1 needs to meet a stringent phase-noise requirement with an adequate target phase noise of – 87 dBc/Hz at a 10 kHz offset and integrated rms phase error less than 1 ° [1]. Because of the very wide frequency range, the variation of loop bandwidth may affect the phase-noise performance and loop stability. This paper presents a wideband fractional-N synthesizer whose loop bandwidth is controlled adaptively. A fast automatic frequency-control (AFC) technique which selects the subband of the VCO is proposed to reduce the residual fractional error to 1 / 16 of the reference frequency f ref. A new 4 / 4. 5 prescaler is adopted to lower the quantization noise by reducing the quantization step size to 0. 5. Figure 23. 4. 1 shows the block diagram of the wideband fractional-N synthesizer and a simplified LC-tank of the wideband VCO.

50|$|A {{switched-mode}} <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> (switching-mode <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> switch-mode <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> switched <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> SMPS, or switcher) is {{an electronic}} <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> that incorporates a switching regulator to convert electrical power efficiently. Like other <b>power</b> <b>supplies,</b> an SMPS transfers power from a DC or AC source (often mains power) to DC loads, {{such as a}} personal computer, while converting voltage and current characteristics. Unlike a linear <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> the pass transistor of a switching-mode supply continually switches between low-dissipation, full-on and full-off states, and spends very little time in the high dissipation transitions, which minimizes wasted energy. Ideally, a switched-mode <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> dissipates no <b>power.</b> Voltage regulation is achieved by varying the ratio of on-to-off time. In contrast, a linear <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> regulates the output voltage by continually dissipating power in the pass transistor.
