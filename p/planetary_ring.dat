5|$|This table {{summarizes}} {{the properties of}} the <b>planetary</b> <b>ring</b> system of Uranus.|$|E
5|$|Neptune has a <b>planetary</b> <b>ring</b> system, {{though one}} much less {{substantial}} {{than that of}} Saturn. The rings may consist of ice particles coated with silicates or carbon-based material, which most likely gives them a reddish hue.|$|E
5|$|The {{action of}} the {{magnetosphere}} traps and accelerates particles, producing intense belts of radiation similar to Earth's Van Allen belts, but thousands of times stronger. The interaction of energetic particles with the surfaces of Jupiter's largest moons markedly affects their chemical and physical properties. Those same particles also affect and {{are affected by the}} motions of the particles within Jupiter's tenuous <b>planetary</b> <b>ring</b> system. Radiation belts present a significant hazard for spacecraft and potentially to human space travellers.|$|E
40|$|The new {{observations}} of <b>planetary</b> <b>rings,</b> including those acquired during the encounters of Voyager with Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus, {{and the discovery}} of incomplete rings around Neptune, reveal the great importance of resonances in determining the dynamics and the shape of <b>planetary</b> <b>rings.</b> Several types of resonances {{play a part in}} <b>planetary</b> <b>rings.</b> Current questions of interest are related to the nonlinear theory of density waves, the confinement of the Uranian rings, and the arcs of rings around Neptune...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} a billiard scattering model {{consisting of two}} non-overlapping rotating discs {{in the context of}} the formation and structural properties of <b>planetary</b> <b>rings.</b> We show that due to the arrangement of the symmetric periodic orbits, stable orbits are found which in the configuration space lead to the appearance of patterns qualitatively similar to <b>planetary</b> <b>rings.</b> Rings associated with different stability regions are naturally braided; different braids may overlap displaying features similar to clumps. Erosion mechanisms within the model are discussed...|$|R
5|$|The four giant {{planets are}} also orbited by <b>planetary</b> <b>rings</b> of varying size and complexity. The rings are {{composed}} primarily of dust or particulate matter, but can host tiny 'moonlets' whose gravity shapes and maintains their structure. Although {{the origins of}} <b>planetary</b> <b>rings</b> is not precisely known, they {{are believed to be}} the result of natural satellites that fell below their parent planet's Roche limit and were torn apart by tidal forces.|$|R
5|$|Cassini {{photographs}} {{have led}} to other significant discoveries. They have revealed a previously undiscovered <b>planetary</b> <b>ring,</b> outside the brighter main rings of Saturn and inside the G and Erings. The source of this ring is hypothesized to be the crashing of a meteoroid off Janus and Epimetheus. In July 2006, Cassini images provided evidence of hydrocarbon lakes near Titan's north pole, the presence of which were confirmed in January 2007. In March 2007, additional images near Titan's north pole revealed hydrocarbon seas, the largest of which is almost {{the size of the}} Caspian Sea. In October 2006, the probe detected an 8,000km diameter cyclone-like storm with an eyewall at Saturn's south pole.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter has a faint <b>planetary</b> <b>ring</b> system {{composed}} of three main segments: an inner torus of particles {{known as the}} halo, a relatively bright main ring, and an outer gossamer ring. These rings appear {{to be made of}} dust, rather than ice as with Saturn's rings. The main ring is probably made of material ejected from the satellites Adrastea and Metis. Material that would normally fall back to the moon is pulled into Jupiter because of its strong gravitational influence. The orbit of the material veers towards Jupiter and new material is added by additional impacts. In a similar way, the moons Thebe and Amalthea probably produce the two distinct components of the dusty gossamer ring. There is also evidence of a rocky ring strung along Amalthea's orbit which may consist of collisional debris from that moon.|$|E
5|$|A {{different}} scenario {{occurs when}} the moon is either revolving around the primary faster than the primary rotates, or is revolving in the direction opposite the planet's rotation. In these cases, the tidal bulge lags behind the moon in its orbit. In the former case, the direction of angular momentum transfer is reversed, so {{the rotation of the}} primary speeds up while the satellite's orbit shrinks. In the latter case, the angular momentum of the rotation and revolution have opposite signs, so transfer leads to decreases in the magnitude of each (that cancel each other out). In both cases, tidal deceleration causes the moon to spiral in towards the primary until it either is torn apart by tidal stresses, potentially creating a <b>planetary</b> <b>ring</b> system, or crashes into the planet's surface or atmosphere. Such a fate awaits the moons Phobos of Mars (within 30to50million years), Triton of Neptune (in 3.6 billion years), Metis and Adrastea of Jupiter, and at least 16 small satellites of Uranus and Neptune. Uranus's Desdemona may even collide with one of its neighboring moons.|$|E
5|$|The two Voyager space probes made {{a number}} of {{important}} discoveries about Jupiter, its satellites, its radiation belts, and its never-before-seen <b>planetary</b> <b>rings.</b>|$|R
50|$|Fainter <b>planetary</b> <b>rings</b> {{can form}} {{as a result}} of {{meteoroid}} impacts with moons orbiting around the planet or, in case of Saturn's E-ring, the ejecta of cryovolcanic material.|$|R
50|$|Alexei Fridman, Nikolai Gor'kavyi: {{science and}} technology, for {{predicting}} {{of a system}} of new satellites of Uranus based on developed theory of collective and collisional processes in <b>planetary</b> <b>rings.</b>|$|R
5|$|Jupiter is {{primarily}} composed of hydrogen with {{a quarter of}} its mass being helium, though helium comprises only about a tenth of the number of molecules. It may also have a rocky core of heavier elements, but like the other giant planets, Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface. Because of its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is that of an oblate spheroid (it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator). The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes, resulting in turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. A prominent result is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that is known to have existed since at least the 17th century when it was first seen by telescope. Surrounding Jupiter is a faint <b>planetary</b> <b>ring</b> system and a powerful magnetosphere. Jupiter has at least 69 moons, including the four large Galilean moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. Ganymede, the largest of these, has a diameter greater than that of the planet Mercury.|$|E
25|$|When Phobos is {{eventually}} {{torn apart by}} tidal forces, {{it is likely that}} a fraction of the debris will form a <b>planetary</b> <b>ring</b> around Mars. This ring may last for between one million and one hundred million years.|$|E
25|$|Images {{and models}} {{indicate}} that Phobos {{may be a}} rubble pile held together by a thin crust, {{and that it is}} being torn apart by tidal interactions. Phobos gets closer to Mars by about 2meters every one hundred years, and it is predicted that within 30 to 50 million years it will either collide with the planet, or break up into a <b>planetary</b> <b>ring.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. An {{extension}} of {{the model of the}} gravitational scattering by moonlets in <b>planetary</b> <b>rings</b> to collisional diffusion is presented. The resulting typical propeller-shaped structures bear the chance to deduce the existence of larger (> 100 meter) embedded bodies in <b>planetary</b> <b>rings.</b> Their spatial extensions provide estimates for the size of the embedded bodies and they contain information about the physical properties of the surrounding ring-material like the kinematic viscosity, massdensity, mean free path and collision frequency. The induced structures lie in the range of the resolution of the Cassini Imaging experiment, and thus, could be observed in near future...|$|R

25|$|The {{rings of}} Saturn {{are the most}} {{extensive}} <b>planetary</b> <b>ring</b> system of any planet in the Solar System. They consist of countless small particles, ranging from Î¼m to m in size, that orbit about Saturn. The ring particles are made almost entirely of water ice, with a trace component of rocky material. There is still no consensus as to their mechanism of formation; some features of the rings suggest a relatively recent origin, but theoretical models indicate {{they are likely to}} have formed early in the Solar System's history.|$|E
500|$|The {{protagonist of}} Anachronox is Sylvester [...] "Sly Boots" [...] Bucelli, a human and former private detective on Anachronox. Twenty-nine {{years old and}} {{described}} as [...] "bold, brash, and overconfident", Boots has gotten himself into trouble and now runs his agency out of rented storage space above a seedy bar. His only friends are PAL-18, his spirited, sarcastic robot assistant since childhood, and Fatima Doohan, his secretary. Fatima was fatally injured and digitized by Boots onto a PDA-analogue [...] "LifeCursor", where she bitterly lives to render assistance. Several allies join Boots {{over the course of}} the game; first is 71-year-old Grumpos Matavastros, a [...] "scholar, outdoorsman, eccentric recluse, and renaissance man"âand a very grumpy person. A former curator of the MysTech museum on Anachronox, Grumpos devotes his life to studying the artifacts. Dr. Rho Bowman joins the party on Sunder; she is a brilliant scientist who's been branded a heretic after publication of her book, MysTech Awake! [...] The team then gains support from Democratus, an eccentric planet boasting a <b>planetary</b> <b>ring</b> and brilliant technology. Said technology includes having the planet shrink to human height to be part of the team. Two further allies are the femme fatale Stiletto Anywayâa 25-year-old former companion of Boots known for being stealthy and aloofâand Paco [...] "El PuÃ±o" [...] Estrella, a washed up superhero who's turned to alcoholism after his comic book series was canceled. Their foes include Detta, a heavyset crime boss/kingpin on planet Anachronox, and several other monsters and shady characters.|$|E

5|$|In the past, astronomers {{once thought}} the rings formed {{alongside}} the planet when it formed {{billions of years}} ago. Instead, the age of these <b>planetary</b> <b>rings</b> is probably some {{hundreds of millions of}} years.|$|R

50|$|Larissa's orbit is {{circular}} but {{not perfect}} and lies below Neptune's synchronous orbit radius, {{so it is}} slowly spiralling inward due to tidal deceleration and may eventually impact Neptune's atmosphere, or break up into a <b>planetary</b> <b>ring</b> upon passing its Roche limit due to tidal stretching, similar to how Triton will crash into Neptune or break into a <b>planetary</b> <b>ring.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{are only}} a few known mean-motion {{resonances}} in the Solar System involving planets, dwarf planets or larger satellites (a much greater number involve asteroids, <b>planetary</b> <b>rings,</b> moonlets and smaller Kuiper belt objects, including many possible dwarf planets).|$|R
5|$|The {{first of}} these <b>planetary</b> <b>rings</b> was {{detected}} in 1968 by {{a team led by}} Edward Guinan. In the early 1980s, analysis of this data along with newer observations led to the hypothesis that this ring might be incomplete.|$|R

40|$|This is {{the final}} report of a three-year, Laboratory-Directed Research and Development (LDRD) project at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). The {{objective}} of this project has been to develop a fundamental understanding of dusty plasmas at the Laboratory. While dusty plasmas are found in space in galactic clouds, <b>planetary</b> <b>rings,</b> and cometary tails, and as contaminants in plasma enhanced fabrication of microelectronics, many of their properties are only partially understood. Our work has involved both theoretical analysis and self-consistent plasma simulations to understand basic properties of dusty plasmas related to equilibrium, stability, and transport. Such an understanding can improve the control and elimination of plasma dust in industrial applications and may be important {{in the study of}} <b>planetary</b> <b>rings</b> and comet dust tails. We have applied our techniques to the study of charging, dynamics, and coagulation of contaminants in plasma processing reactors for industrial etching and deposition processes and to instabilities in <b>planetary</b> <b>rings</b> and other space plasma environments. The work performed in this project has application to plasma kinetics, transport, and other classical elementary processes in plasmas as well as to plasma waves, oscillations, and instabilities...|$|R
