5|$|The player character's <b>proficiency</b> with a {{skill is}} {{increased}} by practice, training, and study. Practice involves performing the specific actions {{associated with a}} given skill, which gradually raises the character's <b>proficiency</b> in that skill. Raising weapon skills requires striking an enemy with the appropriate weapon; raising armor skills requires being struck while wearing the appropriate type of armor; etc. Training involves paying cash to non-player characters (NPCs) in exchange for immediate <b>proficiency</b> increases in that skill. Study requires reading books found in the game, some of which will immediately raise a skill when read. Weaponry skills affect the character's chance to hit. Armor skills affect the defensive strength of the armor. Other skills affect <b>proficiency</b> at other actions such as potion-making, running, lockpicking, etc.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the relationship between elementary school principals’ leadership, supervisory, and administrative <b>proficiencies</b> and student achievement. This study utilized the following descriptive survey and inferential statistical procedures as developmental tools for subsequent analysis and results: (1) development of the questionnaire, (2) validation of the questionnaire, (3) administration of the questionnaire, and (4) collection and analysis of the data using analysis of item means, intercorrelation, regression analysis, and factor analysis. The following research questions were investigated in the study: 1) What are the effects of leadership, administrative, and supervisory <b>proficiencies</b> on student achievement? 2) Is there a difference in leadership, administrative, and supervisory <b>proficiencies</b> between principals in an effective school project and principals in control schools? The findings in this study indicate that: 1) There is no significant relationship between leadership <b>proficiencies</b> and student achievement. 2) There is no significant relationship between administrative <b>proficiencies</b> and student achievement. 3) There is a significant relationship between supervisory <b>proficiencies</b> and student achievement. 4) There is no significant difference in leadership <b>proficiencies</b> between principals practicing ESP and those not in ESP. 5) There is significant difference in administrative <b>proficiencies</b> between principals practicing ESP and those not in ESP. The data indicates that principals in the non-ESP schools are higher on administrative <b>proficiencies</b> than principals in ESP schools. 6) There is significant difference in supervisory <b>proficiencies</b> of IESP and non-ESP schools. The data indicates that here also principals in non-ESP schools are higher on supervisory <b>proficiencies</b> than principals in the ESP schools. 7) There is significant difference in student achievement in project and non-project schools. The data shows that the ESP schools are higher on student achievement than non-ESP schools. Based on the findings of this study, it is recommended that the DeKalb County School System do the following: 1) Use the findings from this study as a pretest and conduct another study in three years to assess gains. 2) Conduct an on-going evaluation of the program to assess short term goals and continuously encourage support and improvement of the ESP. 3) Examine other variables that were not included in this study that could be affecting student achievement...|$|R
50|$|Skills {{learned in}} a cadet's {{time in the}} SCC usually {{fall into one of}} two {{categories}} - Specialisations and <b>Proficiencies.</b> Specialisations are often larger subjects than <b>proficiencies,</b> and so are split into three levels; Basic, Intermediate and Advanced, each level increasing in difficulty building on the knowledge gained from the prior levels. Basic specialisations are often gained at the unit during regular training, while Intermediate and Advanced awards are held on an Area or National basis. <b>Proficiencies</b> do not usually have a levelling system, though some subjects such as Piping do contain a Basic/Intermediate level.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} Oriental Adventures introduced {{two major}} innovations to the AD&D system. Although previous TSR publications, such as Deities & Demigods, had touched on using non-European settings for the game, Oriental Adventures {{was the first}} official supplement devoted entirely to roleplaying in a non-Western setting. Oriental Adventures also introduced a new game mechanic to Dungeons & Dragons; {{it was the first}} official supplement to include rules for non-weapon <b>proficiencies.</b> Every character is expected to possess <b>proficiencies</b> in the noncombat arts with skills such as calligraphy, etiquette, animal handling, iaijutsu (fast draw), and bowyer. Both non-weapon <b>proficiencies</b> and non-European settings were explored in more detail in the 2nd edition AD&D rules.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} role of family-induced {{linguistic}} input as a predictor for <b>proficiencies</b> in written language production of multilingual children aged 11. Our study considers their <b>proficiencies</b> in majority language (German) {{as well as in}} their family languages. Given that in most cases systematic educational support is warranted for majority language only, we assume marginal effects of familial linguistic input on the child's performance in majority language but substantial effects on family language <b>proficiencies.</b> We differentiate between quantitative and qualitative input aspects and include additional social and educational variables that are supposed to interfere with the relation between linguistic input and language <b>proficiencies.</b> The study is based on cross-sectional data collected in a pilot study, including Russian-German, Turkish-German and Vietnamese-German children in northern Germany. We computed nested OLS-regression models to examine the hypothesized relations. Results indicate that effects of familial quantitative input in German decrease when controlled for duration of contact with the majority language and for type of school the children attend. We discuss these factors mainly as indicators for external linguistic input. On the other hand we find support for the hypothesis that the quality of familial input in the family language has significant effect on the child's writing <b>proficiencies</b> in this language. We find no evidence that structural factors of the social background play an independent role in the examined relations...|$|R
