50|$|Initially, the Well Tractor formed Welltec’s tool portfolio, but in 2003 the {{so-called}} mechanical down hole services {{were added to}} the portfolio of technology. These intervention services are intended for electric wireline operations such as valve manipulation, scale milling, setting and pulling <b>plugs,</b> <b>milling</b> <b>plugs</b> and sand bailing.To date, Welltec has developed and produced seven tools with different areas of operation. Apart from the Wireline Well Tractor, a Coiled tubing Well Tractor has been manufactured, which instead of running on wireline is fluid-driven. The mechanical down hole services consist of the Well Stroker, the Well Key, the Well Cleaner, the Well Miller and the Welltec Release Device. All tool names are registered trademarks of Welltec.|$|R

40|$|A typical {{completion}} procedure requires {{placement of}} a bridge plug near the liner {{top of a}} producing steam well so the well can be loaded to permit cementing of the tieback casing string by conventional cementing techniques. A drillable bridge plug {{has been used in}} the past so that it could be removed with a conventional toothed, cone-type drill bit. All components could not be drilled out because the bridge plug would separate from the casing when drilling through its top slips. This created a hazardous situation because heavy components remaining in the well could blowout after placing the well into production and damage or destroy surface equipment. A bridge plug and its companion milling-type retrieving tool were developed to perform the bridging operation and accomplish removal in a producing geothermal steam well environment. The bridge plug features an internal briding plug that is designed to permit the release of differential pressure buildup from below before releasing the bridge <b>plug</b> by <b>milling</b> away the top slips. The millinog-type retrieving tool has a catcher mechanism designed to function in the high-velocity steam flow of a producing well to catch the released bridge plug. After the released bridge plug components are caught, they may be returned to the surface in a controlled manner. This removes the massive components so {{that they will not be}} blown out by the steam of a producing well. Field use has demonstrated that this equipment is a practical completion aid, and it is currently being used in The Geysers field of northern California. Examples of field usage are discussed in the paper...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to determine the}} effect of grinding on the acidulation of phosphate rock. Bench-scale work was carried out in a one quart, laboratory ball mill made of stainless steel. The mill was equipped with a heating chamber so that the material could also be dried in the mill;The results from this work indicated that a normal superphosphate product suitable for commercial use could be obtained within an hour after the addition of the first acid. The product had low moisture and low free acid contents, and under suitable conditions, granular form. The mixing action of the balls resulted in good heat transfer during drying with little danger of overheating the product. Consequently, the drying air temperature had little effect on the product except in the rate of production. The reaction was sufficiently rapid in the mill so that no preliminary grinding period was necessary before the drying operation was started. Low acidulation ratios resulted in low conversions as in any normal superphosphate process. Low acid concentrations were more conducive to a rapid reaction between the rock and acid. Below an acid strength of about 55 percent, however, there was no further advantage in dilution;The favorable results of the bench-scale work led to the construction of a pilot plant to determine whether the process could be carried out on a larger scale and on a continuous basis. The process was built around a heated tube mill with a stainless steel lining and a feeding mechanism. Heating was indirect. The acid and rock were fed into one end of the mill and product taken from the other;Successful pilot plant operation showed that the bench-scale results could be duplicated on a larger scale and on a continuous or semicontinuous basis. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the materials could be handled satisfactorily in the tube <b>mill.</b> <b>Plugging</b> and other difficulties were overcome;Finally, an economic comparison of the process with an equivalent, standard, normal superphosphate process indicated that the quick-curing process was favored. Fixed capital, production cost and working capital were estimated to be less than for a conventional, normal superphosphate process. The estimated return on investment for a conventional plant was 3. 8 percent while the equivalent quick-curing plant gave an estimated 5. 6 percent...|$|R
40|$|When a well is {{permanently}} plugged {{and abandoned}} (P&A), a plug {{has to be}} set over the entire {{cross section of the}} well. The conventional method to perform a P&A operation is to mill the casing and pull it to surface before plugging the well, which is a time consuming and expensive method. The perforate, wash and cement (PWC) method is a very interesting technology. It has the possibility to be both faster and more cost effective than a milling operation. Today the main challenge for the PWC technology is the time consumption on the verification of the <b>plug.</b> For a <b>milling</b> operation the cement will always cover the entire plugging area, as this is an open hole. When plugging a well with the PWC technology the cement is forced through small perforations into the annulus or both annuli. Continuous cement in the annulus has to be verified to approve the plug. For a single casing, this can easily be performed by drilling the plug and logging the annulus. The challenge arises when two casings are cemented, because currently there are no technologies available to log through two casings. Reducing the time used on drilling the plug and logging the cement is the key for the PWC technology to become a cost effective P&A method. When operators have set enough successful plugs to rely on the PWC technology, there will be no need to drill out the plug and log the annulus anymore. The verification of the plug can then be performed according to NORSOK D- 010 requirements, which is pressure testing and tagging of the plug. So for now the largest challenge is to verify continuous cement in two annuli, and finding a technology to get a faster and more accurate result when pressure testing the plug. The main scope with this thesis is to give an insight into the PWC technology, discuss the verification challenges, and suggest solutions for future verification methods. It also gives an insight into the regulations and requirements that a P&A operation needs to fulfill. The thesis is divided into four parts; description of NORSOK D- 010 regulations and requirements for a P&A operation, general theory for cementing and verification, the PWC technology, and finally a verification, discussion and conclusion part...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Grain Science and IndustryLeland McKinneyThree {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate value added uses for dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS) and crude glycerol in swine and poultry diets. In Exp. 1, crude glycerol from multiple biodiesel production facilities was evaluated for storage and variability characteristics. Part one reviewed the storage capabilities of crude glycerol at room temperature and excessive heat conditions on ferrous and stainless steel metal. There was no notable corrosion during the two-month experiment for either metal type under each condition. There was a slight discoloration observed on the ferrous metal stored under excessive heat conditions, but no pitting or sign of corrosion was noted. No changes were observed in the stainless steel under either environment condition. Part two evaluated the variability of crude glycerol from multiple biodiesel production facilities. Representative samples of the parent feedstock and resultant glycerol was collected an analyzed. There was considerable variation between samples, particularly when comparing glycerol from the different feedstocks (vegetable vs. animal). Exp. 2 and 3 {{took place in the}} Feed Processing Research Center in the Department of Grain Science at Kansas State University. Pellet quality and electrical energy consumption was evaluated by reviewing production rate, conditioning and hot pellet temperatures, motor load, and pellet durability index (PDI) as testing parameters. In Exp. 2, diets containing varying levels of crude glycerol were evaluated on pellet quality and pellet mill performance in a pilot mill and in a commercial facility. For part one, a corn-soy based swine grower diet was formulated to contain 0, 3, 6, and 9 % crude glycerol. Each diet was steam conditioned to 150, 170 and 190 °F in an atmospheric conditioner and pelleted. An interaction existed between glycerol and conditioning temperature. For all diets containing glycerol, roll skid occurred and the pellet <b>mill</b> <b>plugged</b> as conditioning temperature approached 190 °F. Pellet quality increased linearly (P. 001). Electrical consumption in diets containing DDGS compared to the control showed no significance in reduction in energy usage (P>. 001). In conclusion, the production of pelleted diets containing crude glycerol is a feasible option; however, conditioning temperatures should be kept minimal and storage and variation of the material should be considered. In addition, improved pellet quality in pelleted diets containing DDGS is in part by conditioning at higher temperatures, respectively. The data suggests that the addition of crude glycerol and DDGS in animal diets can serve as a beneficial feed additive...|$|R
