He {{was one of the}} few photographers active in the Indies in the 1860s; contemporaries included Isidore van Kinsbergen, Adolph Schaefer, and the commercial firm of Woodbury and Page (operated by Walter B. Woodbury and James Page). Meessen hoped to eventually take images of the Indies' various lands and people. From May to August he was in Sumatra, first in Padang and later in the Minang Highlands. There he offered various <b>photographic</b> <b>services,</b> including double and family portraits. When he returned to Batavia in September, he opened another studio, offering portraits and selling prints of landscapes.|$|E
500|$|As {{this was}} happening, Briskin {{was asked to}} return to active duty, {{this time in the}} navy, for a brief stint in the {{beginning}} of March, 1945; he was assigned to the Photographic Sciences Laboratory, where he was to evaluate the Navy's filming activity. By the end of the month, he had finished his study, and submitted his findings to Captain Gene Markey, head of the Navy's <b>Photographic</b> <b>Services,</b> after which he returned to Hollywood to continue setting up Capra-Briskin. With Capra still in the service, Briskin incorporated the new film studio, with the name Liberty Films, in late April 1945. One of the first properties they went after was the hugely successful play, Harvey. In July, they convinced William Wyler to join their fledgling company, and he became part-owner, agreeing to start work for the company {{as soon as he was}} discharged from the army, and produce one film per year for the studio. In August, Briskin negotiated a deal with RKO Studios for Liberty Pictures to film 9 movies at the RKO studio, [...] and in September Wyler announced that the company would produce 3 films a year for their deal with RKO. Before the end of the year George Stevens had also become a part owner in the venture.|$|E
