50|$|The Bendix system {{places the}} starter drive pinion on a helical drive spring. When the starter motor begins turning, the inertia {{of the drive}} <b>pinion</b> <b>assembly</b> causes it to wind the spring forcing {{the length of the}} spring to change and engage with the ring gear. When the engine starts, {{backdrive}} from the ring gear causes the drive pinion to exceed the rotative speed of the starter, at which point the drive pinion is forced back and out of mesh with the ring gear.|$|E
50|$|This overrunning-clutch pinion {{arrangement}} was phased into use {{beginning in the}} early 1960s; before that time, a Bendix drive was used. The Bendix system places the starter drive pinion on a helically cut drive shaft. When the starter motor begins turning, the inertia of the drive <b>pinion</b> <b>assembly</b> causes it to ride forward on the helix and thus engage with the ring gear. When the engine starts, backdrive from the ring gear causes the drive pinion to exceed the rotative speed of the starter, at which point the drive pinion is forced back down the helical shaft and thus out of mesh with the ring gear.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This {{study is}} focused on {{predicting}} the fatigue life expectancy of Girth gear-pinion assembly used in cement industries. Gear design and modeling was carried out using a CAD package and analysis was done using finite element analysis software, ANSYS. AISI 4135 -low alloy steel material properties are considered and linear elastic finite element analysis and fatigue life analysis were carried out. The variable amplitude load is applied to simulate the real time loading of the gear-pinion assembly. Rainflow cycle counting algorithm and Minarâ€™s linear damage rule is employed to predict the fatigue life. The critical stress and the corresponding deformation {{are discussed in the}} results. Finally the life expectancy of the girth gear and <b>pinion</b> <b>assembly</b> is estimated which would be useful for the periodical maintenance of the gear assembly...|$|E

The suitlock docking mechanism comprises a single actuator that controls latches which, in turn, respectfully control rack and <b>pinion</b> <b>assemblies</b> that allow for easy removal and attachment of a life support equipment enclosure shell to the environmental protective suit or to the vehicle from which the operator performs his/her duties...|$|R
40|$|Researchers at Sandia have {{recently}} {{designed and built}} several research prototypes, which demonstrate that truly complex mechanical systems can now be realized in a surface micromachined technology. These MicroElectro- Mechanical Systems (MEMS) include advanced actuators, torque multiplying gear tmins, rack and <b>pinion</b> <b>assemblies,</b> positionable mirrors, and mechanical discriminators. All of tile mechanical components are batch fabricated on a single chip of silicon using the infrastructure origimdly developed to support today's highly reliabk; and robust microelectronics industry. Sand ia is also developing the technology 10 integrate microelectronic circuits onto the s,ime piece of silicon {{that is used to}} fabricate the MEMS devices. This significantly increases sensitivity and reliability, while fhrther reducing package size and fabrication costs. A review of the MEMS technology and capabilities available at Sandia National Laboratories is presented...|$|R
50|$|The front {{suspension}} is {{a sophisticated}} clean sheet, double wishbone layout {{that is also}} cleverly symmetrical from left to right, thus reducing spares inventories, etc. Both {{the front and rear}} suspension oscillations are dampened by adjustable bump and rebound shock absorbers fitted with adjustable spring platforms.The rack and <b>pinion</b> power steering <b>assembly</b> is mounted ahead of the engine in order to better optimise the front suspension geometry and the high loads generated under long distance racing events.|$|R
40|$|Investigation {{showed that}} the pinion AHF- 12516 had failed by fatigue leading to {{subsequent}} damages to the main gearbox. The chips detected by the magnetic plug were resulted from the crushed fragments of the pinion teeth. Pinion AHF- 12516 had failed by tooth bending fatigue. Evidences suggest that tooth bending fatigue was caused due to misalignment in the assembly. The pinions were found to conform to design specification in terms of dimension, effective case depth, surface hardness, core hardness and microstructure. No metallurgical and/or mechanical abnormalities were responsible for fatigue crack initiation and the fatigue was stress related. From the components provided for investigation, {{it was not possible}} to identify the cause(s) for misalignment in the <b>pinion</b> <b>assembly.</b> It is recommended that the affected MGB be subjected to detailed examination in an effort to establish as to what could cause the misalignment...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of a}} {{collaborative}} research program between NASA Ames Research Center (ARC), NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC), and the US Army Laboratory, a series of experiments is being performed in GRC's 500 HP OH- 58 Transmission Test Rig facility and ARC's AH-I Cobra and OH- 58 c helicopters. The findings reported in this paper were drawn from Phase-I of a two-phase test-rig experiment, and {{are focused on the}} vibration response of an undamaged pinion gear operating in the transmission test rig. To simulate actual flight conditions, the transmission system was run at three torque levels, as well as two mast lifting and two mast bending levels. The test rig was also subjected to disassembly and reassembly of the main pinion housing to simulate the effect of maintenance operations. An analysis of variance based on the total power of the spectral distribution indicates the relative effect of each experimental factor, including Wong interactions with torque. Reinstallation of the main <b>pinion</b> <b>assembly</b> is shown to introduce changes in the vibration signature, suggesting the possibility of a strong effect of maintenance on HUMS design and use. Based on these results, further research will be conducted to compare these vibration responses with actual OH 58 c helicopter transmission vibration patterns...|$|E
40|$|Electrical {{power has}} become a primary necessity. Energy from ocean waves remains largely an {{untapped}} resource. The aim of the project is to generate electricity from waves. The wave energy converter (WEC) captures energy contained in the ocean waves to generate electricity. The electrical energy is generated from the mechanical work harnessed from the waves by using generator. The power production depends upon {{the intensity of the}} waves. Traditionally, in wave energy converters only the vertical motion of the buoy is converted into electricity. But in this method both the vertical and horizontal motions of the buoy is converted into electricity. The mechanism used here is the rack and pinion mechanism. The setup consists of rack and <b>pinion,</b> gear <b>assembly,</b> DC generator and a rectifier circuit. The buoy is fixed with the rack and pinion setup which in turn is coupled with the gear assembly and it is coupled with the generator. The gear assembly is used to increase the input speed of the generator shaft. The rectifier circuit is used to change the polarity of the current produced. A maximum of 12 V can be produced. In this paper both the vertical and horizontal motions of the buoy is converted into electricity...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} to estimate the contact pattern for gear drives. The proposed method {{is based on the}} geometric properties of the generated surfaces of the pinion and the gear and it neglects the mechanical characteristics of the mating members. The key feature of the method is the superimposition of a virtual marking compound over the gear surface that mimics the industrial practice of contact pattern inspection. For each meshing condition the instantaneous contact area is estimated as the intersection of the pinion surface with the marking compound gear surface. Finally, the contact pattern is estimated by the convex envelope of all the instantaneous contact areas in the zr-plane. The marking compound shape is identified through an optimization process to match a target contact pattern obtained, e. g. with an accurate loaded tooth contact analysis tool. The proposed method has been tested with a dedicated FEM software package capable of producing a very accurate contact pattern estimation of the contact pattern under load. Extensive simulations have shown that, once the optimal marking compound shape has been identified, the proposed method computes a reliable contact pattern even for very different surface geometries (e. g. an ease-off on the <b>pinion</b> surface) and <b>assembly</b> errors. The computational cost of the entire procedure is about two orders of magnitude lower than that required to run the full FEM analysis. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
