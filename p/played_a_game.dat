5|$|Born in Beaufort, North Carolina, Taylor {{attended}} East Carteret High School, {{where his}} pitching ability {{caused him to}} be chosen by the New York Yankees with the first overall selection in the 1991 Major League Baseball Draft. After two full seasons in the minor leagues, he injured his shoulder in a fight, and was ineffective after returning to baseball. He retired in 2000, having never <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> above Class AA. Taylor was the second of two players to be picked first overall in the MLB draft to never reach the major leagues, the other one being Steve Chilcott.|$|E
5|$|Bradford City {{became the}} first league {{football}} team from the county, before they even had a team or <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>game.</b> They and Chelsea, who were elected to the league two years later, share {{the distinction of being}} the only clubs to join the league without having played a competitive fixture. A summer archery contest, which had been organised {{to raise money for the}} rugby league club, was used to finance the new club, and Manningham's colours of claret and amber were adopted as Bradford City's kit, but with Manningham's hoops changed to stripes.|$|E

5|$|From 29 January to 4 February, Carlsen {{played in}} the Zurich Chess Challenge, winning the blitz event (+2−1=2) and the {{classical}} event (+3−0=2). He fared worse in the rapid event (+1−2=2), which counted towards the overall standings, but retained enough of a lead to win the tournament. The other players in the event were Aronian, Nakamura, Caruana, Gelfand and Anand. On 22 March, Carlsen <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> for his club Stavanger in the final team match for promotion to the Norwegian Premier League. His win over Vladimir Georgiev helped his team to a 3½–2½ win over Nordstrand.|$|E
5|$|Neuer {{was born}} in Fremont, Ohio, {{and was one of}} eight {{children}} born to Henry Neuer and Jennie Catherman. He and his family moved to Sunbury, Pennsylvania, when he was a child. In 1898, Neuer enlisted in the Spanish–American War as a private, and was discharged the following year. After his discharge, he worked as a brakeman for a local railroad for the next few years. In late 1904, the Detroit Tigers intended to sign Neuer to a contract. However, nothing came of it and he never <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> with the organization.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} 2006 game, the Chick-fil-A Bowl {{purchased}} {{the right to}} select the highest-ranked Atlantic Coast Conference team after representatives from the Bowl Championship Series made their selection. The contract was renewed in 2009, extending that right through 2013. According to the official selection rules used in the 2009-10 season, the team chosen to represent the ACC in the Chick-fil-A Bowl had to be within one conference victory of the remaining highest-ranked conference team or ranked more than five spaces ahead of the ACC team with the best conference record available in the final BCS standings. Following {{the conclusion of the}} 2009 college football regular season, the Chick-fil-A Bowl selection committee bypassed the ACC Championship Game loser, Clemson, in order to pick Virginia Tech, which had the same conference record. The committee believed a game featuring Virginia Tech would draw more television viewers and in-person attendance than Clemson, even though the Chick-fil-A Bowl was the third time that season Virginia Tech <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> in Atlanta.|$|E

5|$|Bradford City {{were formed}} in 1903 and were elected into the Second Division {{before they had}} even <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>game.</b> Bradford City and Chelsea, in 1905, remain the only teams to be elected into the league before playing a {{competitive}} fixture. The club were promoted to the First Division when they won the Second Division title in 1907–08. In 1910–11 the club recorded their highest league position of fifth and also won their only major honour when captain Jimmy Speirs lifted the FA Cup after he scored the only goal to defeat Newcastle United 1–0 in the final replay. Bradford City's honours also include the Third Division North title in 1928–29 and the Third Division crown in 1984–85, {{as well as the}} Third Division North Challenge Cup in 1938–39.|$|E
5|$|In the 1975–76 season, Delta State and Immaculata {{met again}} in the {{national}} tournament final. Harris again led Delta State with 30 points and 18 rebounds in a 69–64 victory.

In her senior season, Delta State <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> in the Madison Square Garden, in which Harris scored 47 points. This {{was one of the first}} women's basketball game ever played there. Delta State then went to the national tournament final for the third year in a row. In the final, Harris scored 23 points and recorded 16 rebounds as Delta State defeated Louisiana State University 68–55 for their third consecutive title.|$|E
5|$|Maryland {{head coach}} Ralph Friedgen made {{his case to}} bowl {{officials}} {{by saying that the}} Terrapins had beaten four of the other five 4–4 teams and not <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> against the fifth, Miami. Three of those teams were selected ahead of Maryland: the Meineke Car Care Bowl selected the nearby North Carolina team; the Gator Bowl chose Clemson, a school with a traditionally well-traveling fanbase; and the Emerald Bowl selected Miami. After the higher-priority bowl games made their selections, the Humanitarian Bowl had the choice of either Maryland or Wake Forest, the school with the smallest enrollment in any BCS football conference. Humanitarian Bowl officials chose Maryland in light of its larger alumni base, well-traveled fans, and greater television marketing potential.|$|E

Though downtown Des Moines was under a mandatory evacuation, team officials received permission from the city {{to play the game}} as long as no fans were allowed into Principal Park. In order to keep fans away, the lights and scoreboard were not turned on, the game was not broadcast in the local market, and a message on the team's website announced that the game was postponed. PCL Commissioner Branch Rickey III believed that {{this was the first time}} such actions were taken out of necessity. Kremblas' Sounds ended with a 59–81record, the second-lowest in the team's history.|$|E
5|$|Barry John {{was born}} in Cefneithin, Carmarthenshire in Wales. He was educated at Gwendraeth Grammar School in the Gwendraeth Valley, north of Llanelli. He {{attended}} Cefenithin Primary, {{and there he was}} fortunate to receive skilled rugby teaching. The headmaster, William John Jones, and teacher Ray Williams, were both former Wales international rugby players. Despite his natural talents, he never played at schoolboy level for Wales, but represented both his school and his local village team, Cefneithin RFC. He once <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> for rival team Pontyberem while still a schoolboy, but John recalls in his autobiography that the local resentment at making such a sporting faux pas ensured he never did so again. While still a teenager attending grammar school, he made his first top-flight rugby appearance for Llanelli, on 4 January 1964 in an encounter with Moseley. Although Llanelli lost the encounter, John scored a try and converted it, and played in four more matches for the Llanelli senior team {{towards the end of the}} season. He continued to represent Llanelli while at Trinity College, Carmarthen, and gained a reputation as a kicking fly-half with a penchant for putting over dropped goals. During the 1964/65 season, John began to make an impact on the Welsh club scene. His dropped goal against Aberavon on 26 October 1964, only 17games in, was his 11th of the season.|$|E
5|$|In {{an article}} in the St. Paul Daily Globe, the {{reporter}} summed up the events of Adams' exhibition on April 26, 1888:The great finger billiard exhibition came off last night at the Standard billiard hall to a packed house, and those who saw Yank Adams handle the spheres were more than delighted.... Shot after shot were made in lightning rapidity, spotting the ball, running the whole length of the rail, crossing over, with two cushions and counting, going under hats and in between them, cutting the letter S and making the carom, jump shots, masses and hundreds of others too complicated to put in type. Mr. A.M. Doherty <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> with the exhibitor, and at twenty-eight points left the balls in a scattered position, which were gathered at one shot by Mr. Adams, who made fifty shots in sixty seconds. What seemed his most difficult shot was that of placing fifteen balls in a line, and a piece of chalk on the last ball. The hand ball was then dropped a distance of two feet, described a semi-circle, making a carom on all of the balls and freezing against the last ball. Adams' finger shots discount Schaeffer, Slosson and J. Carter combined.|$|E

5|$|Though he {{secretly}} <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> for Rothwell Town in 1988, {{he played}} amateur football {{for the first}} time since childhood with pub side New Wheel in 2000, and broke his nose in a game for the club. He gained his A-licence, which allowed him to coach in the professional game, and he took up coaching at Ossett Town. He and John Beresford then set up an unsuccessful wooden flooring company called 'Major Oaks'. The pair then developed a football training product called 'BallMax', Alex Ferguson used it in the Manchester United Academy, but this business also went nowhere. Billy Jennings then took the pair on as football agents at Premier Management International for a twelve-month period. Northampton Town manager Martin Wilkinson then took Swan on as a coach, but soon after Colin Calderwood took over as manager in 2003 Swan found himself again out of work. Swan instead found success in the building trade, constructing a house in his expansive back garden. He also found work as an 'expert witness' for Hull City's games at BBC Radio Humberside in 2003. The next year he also began working as a pundit for the Hull Daily Mail, and did occasional work for BBC Look North.|$|E
