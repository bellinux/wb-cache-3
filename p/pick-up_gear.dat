5000|$|Due to {{a higher}} boiler {{pressure}} than the Crabs the cylinders were 3" [...] smaller in diameter and so the cylinders were able to be mounted horizontally: the only Stanier design to do so. Like the Crabs they were connected to a Fowler tender that was narrower than the locomotive. When built the first ten locomotives had no water <b>pick-up</b> <b>gear</b> fitted to their tenders.|$|E
50|$|The boilers {{were the}} same as for the 9K. All were built with {{saturated}} boilers and, as for the 9Ks, were rebuilt with superheating as their boilers were replaced. The first to be superheated was NÂº 1122 in 1914, although this was not a new boiler and only lasted until 1923 when it was replaced by a saturated boiler. All were converted under LNER ownership, from 1926 to 1935. Water <b>pick-up</b> <b>gear</b> and shortened chimneys to fit the LNER loading gauge were removed and changed as for the 9K class.|$|E
