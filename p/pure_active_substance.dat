40|$|Adequate {{treatment}} of Parkinson's patients in off periods with orally administered levodopa is hindered by a poor bioavailability and a slow onset of action. Hence, {{there is a}} need for a fast and reliable alternative as for instance via pulmonary administration of the drug. We developed a levodopa containing powder formulation for pulmonary delivery by a recently presented high dose dry powder inhaler (Cyclops). The objective was to produce the drug formulation by means of simple techniques such as micronization, either as <b>pure</b> <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> or with a minimum amount of excipients. After an initial screening on dispersion behaviour, the most promising formulation in the Cyclops was characterized in vitro over a range of pressure drops (2 - 6 kPa) and doses (20, 30 and 40 mg), representative of those to be expected in practice. A co-micronized levodopa formulation with 2 % l-leucine appeared to yield the best aerosol properties for inhalation and highest delivered dose reproducibility. The combination of this particular formulation and the Cyclops inhaler seems to meet the basic requirements for satisfactory deposition in the airways. This formulation is therefore expected to be a promising candidate for the {{treatment of}} Parkinson's patients in an off period...|$|E

Spremljali smo spremembe talilnega pika PCM enostavnih fizikalnih mešanic glede na čisto učinkovino, pripravljenih z mehanskim mešanjem v ahatni tarilnici in pripravljenih na način, da smo stalili mešanice na vodni kopeli, ohladili in posneli na DSC. Primerjali smo vpliv različnih tehnik priprave mešanic na obliko DSC krivulje. Prav tako smo preučevali vpliv hitrosti gretja pri DSC meritvah na temperaturo talilnih pikov PEG. Meritve so bile narejene v atmosferi zraka. Ugotovili smo, da so interakcije med učinkovino in PEG odvisne od sestave mešanic, molske mase PEG in načina priprave mešanic.

40|$|Although Lobophora {{belongs to}} a marine algal family (Dictyotaceae) that {{produces}} a large array of secondary metabolites, it has received little attention compared to other genera, such as Dictyota, in terms of natural compounds isolation and characterization. However, metabolites produced by Lobophora species {{have been found to}} exhibit a wide array of bioactivities including pharmacological (e. g. antibacterial, antiviral, antioxidant, antitumoral), pesticidal, and ecological. This review aims to report the state-of-the-art of the natural products isolated from Lobophora species (Dictyotales, Phaeophyceae) and their associated bioactivities. All bioactivities documented in the literature are reported, therefore including studies for which <b>pure</b> <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> were described, as well as studies limited to extracts or fractions. From the early 1980 s until today, 49 scientific works have been published on Lobophora chemistry and bioactivity, among which 40 have reported bioactivities. Only six studies, however, have identified, characterized and tested no less than 23 bioactive pure compounds (three C- 21 polyunsaturated alcohols, three fatty-acids, a macrolactone, 11 polyketides, a few sulfated polysaccharides, three sulfolipids, a tocopherol derivative). The present review intends to raise awareness of chemists and biologists given the recent significant taxonomic progress of this brown algal genus, which holds a promising plethora of natural products yet to be discovered with ecological and pharmacological properties...|$|R
30|$|Commercial {{herbicides}} {{are rarely}} <b>pure</b> <b>active</b> compounds. Nowadays, commonly used formulations contain supplementary ingredients which work as carriers, surfactants, stabilizers or dyes [1]. Those which enhance biological activity of herbicide are called adjuvants [2]. They {{are classified as}} activators and spray or utility modifiers and are added to herbicide either at the factory or field level. Today, more than 3000 adjuvants of diverse constituencies are offered on a market [3]. Additionally, formulations contain safeners which increase the herbicide selectivity between crop and weed species [4]. They show {{a wide range of}} affinities and selectivities towards heavy metals in soil. In particular, amines which are frequently present in commercial products are prone to interact with metals [5] and influence their uptake and absorption by the plant roots. Regrettably, investigations on heavy metal accumulation by agricultural plants under the presence of herbicides are focused on <b>pure</b> <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> [6]. Commercial formulations are examined scarcely [7]. This is difficult because according to current EU and US regulations [8, 9] chemical composition of additives is not to be mentioned on the product label and is usually bottled up by the manufacturers. They are obliged to specify the <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> of particular herbicide formulation only. This is a very uncomfortable situation because all ingredients are being introduced to the environment and their join impact cannot be properly assessed. Moreover, toxicity evaluations based on a single component can often lead to misleading conclusions [10]. The latter was proved by Mesnage et al. [8] who found that in certain circumstances organic adjuvants present in glyphosate-based herbicides were 10, 000 times more toxic than <b>active</b> <b>substance.</b> We believe that this situation ought to be changed at the national and the EU legal level and manufacturers should publish the complete composition of all formulations in the market. Phenoxyacetic herbicides are synthetic auxins widely used in agriculture. They control broadleaf weeds by affecting growth of the plant’s vascular tissue and are being often applied to protect grass and grain crops [11]. The most common representatives are 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D) and 2 -methyl- 4 -chlorophenoxyacetic acid (MCPA) [12]. They are active ingredients of two agrochemicals widely used in Europe, i.e. Aminopielik D 450 SL and Chwastox 300 SL.|$|R
40|$|From 15 marine sponges {{harvested}} at the Adriatic {{coast and}} in the Aegean Sea, respectively, we have isolated approximately 150 different bacteria. After cultivation and screening for novel natural compounds we have focussed on three bacteria, which showed interesting results in antimicrobial assays. The bacteria were identified by 16 S rDNA technology and the molecular structures of the products were elucidated: Pseudoalteromonas piscicida from Crella rosea was able to synthesize hexadecenoic acid and heptadecenoic acid, resp., which were active against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Besides amino acid degradation compounds, Microbacterium spec. from Halichondria panicea produced a novel glycoglyerolipid. In the case of Staphylococcus hominis from Halichondria cratera unsaturated fatty acids were detected as antimicrobially acting substances. As for all three bacteria, intensive studies on the optimization of growth and natural compound production were carried out in 10 l - 50 l bioreactors. Up to 200 mg l"-" 1 of <b>pure</b> <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> have been producted. To dominat glycoglycerolipid GGL. 2 and its corresponding hydrolysis product (from alkaline treatment) showed good antitumoral properties; they inhibited the TPA induced activation of the Epstein-Barr-virus early antigen (EBV-EA). These compounds {{as well as the}} previously mentioned natural products were able to inhibit protein kinases too, but in a nonspecific manner. Some of the microbial crude products showed NMDA antagonistic effects in the [" 3 H]-MK 801 binding assay, other raw materials indicated cytotoxic effects on the tumoral cell line L 5178 Y. In the future it is necessary to use chromatographically enriched products for these studies. (orig.)

50|$|Bone cement {{has proven}} {{particularly}} useful because specific <b>active</b> <b>substances,</b> e.g. antibiotics, {{can be added}} to the powder component. The <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> are released locally after implant placement of the new joint, i.e. in the immediate vicinity of the new prosthesis and have been confirmed to reduce the danger of infection. The antibiotics act against bacteria precisely at the site where they are required in the open wound without subjecting the body in general to unnecessarily high antibiotic levels. This makes bone cement a modern drug delivery system that delivers the required drugs directly to the surgical site. The important factor is not how much <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> is in the cement matrix but how much of the <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> is actually released locally. Too much <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> in the bone cement would actually be detrimental, because the mechanical stability of the fixed prosthesis is weakened by a high proportion of <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> in the cement. The local <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> levels of industrially manufactured bone cements that are formed by the use of bone cements that contain <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> are approximate (assuming that there is no incompatibility) and are significantly below the clinical routine dosages for systemic single injections.|$|R

50|$|As {{indicated}} above, {{the risk}} assessment of biocides in EU hinges {{for a large}} part {{by the development of}} specific emission scenario documents (ESDs) for each product type, which is essential for assessing its exposure of man and the environment. Such ESDs provide detailed scenarios to be used for an initial worse case exposure assessment and for subsequent refinements. ESDs are developed in close collaboration with the OECD Task Force on Biocides and the OECD Exposure Assessment Task Force and are publicly available from websites managed by the Joint Research Centre and OECD (see below). Once ESDs become available they are introduced in the European Union System for the Evaluation of Substances (EUSES), an IT tool supporting the implementation of the risk assessment principles set in the Technical Guidance Document for the Risk Assessment of Biocides (TGD). EUSES enables government authorities, research institutes and chemical companies to carry out rapid and efficient assessments of the general risks posed by substances to man and the environment. Once a biocidal <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> is allowed onto the list of approved <b>active</b> <b>substances,</b> its specifications become a reference source of that <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> (so called 'reference active substance'). Thus, when an alternative source of that <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> appears (e.g. from a company that have not participated in the Review Programme of <b>active</b> <b>substances)</b> or when a change appears in the manufacturing location and/or manufacturing process of a reference <b>active</b> <b>substance,</b> then a technical equivalence between these different sources needs to be established with regard to the chemical composition and hazard profile.
