2500|$|In August 2010, Kim and her {{coach of}} four years, Brian Orser, parted ways. Their split was first made {{known to the}} public by Orser's press release. Orser's {{dismissal}} was reported as [...] "sudden and unexpected" [...] and no explanation was given for the split. Orser made the separation public, saying {{he did not want}} it to become a distraction for his other skaters, including Americans Adam Rippon and Christina Gao. Rippon {{said in an interview that}} they had known about the situation longer than the general public, and had had time to deal with it, noting that [...] "it hasn't affected Brian's coaching, and it certainly hasn't affected my training." [...] Kim posted an online message accusing Orser of lying. She stated on her official website that they had been maintaining an awkward and ambiguous relationship for months and that she was perplexed by Orser's announcement. She also said that the dismissal had been her decision and that the reason behind it did not need to be made public. After the split, Orser gave several interviews regarding the end of their collaboration. On August 25, 2010, Orser caused controversy by revealing Kim's 2010–2011 competitive <b>program</b> <b>information</b> to the press without Kim and her choreographer's consent. Soon after, Kim left the rink where she had trained with Orser to train at the East West Ice Palace in Los Angeles owned by Michelle Kwan and Kwan's family.
