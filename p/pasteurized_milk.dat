5|$|Unlike most artisan cheese makers, Beecher's mainly uses <b>pasteurized</b> <b>milk</b> and {{operates}} a high-volume modern production facility, with multiple farms supplying milk. When Beecher's encountered problems in guaranteeing the standard {{flavor of the}} milks they were using to make cheese, the company bought their own herds of dairy cattle and farms to ensure control of the cheese products from beginning to end. Beecher's uses various cheese cultures when mixing cheeses, so a cheddar cheese produced by Beecher's may use cultures not normally intended for cheddar cheese production.|$|E
5|$|The M. {{tuberculosis}} complex (MTBC) {{includes four}} other TB-causing mycobacteria: M. bovis, M. africanum, M. canetti, and M. microti. M. africanum is not widespread, {{but it is}} a significant cause of tuberculosis in parts of Africa. M. bovis was once a common cause of tuberculosis, but the introduction of <b>pasteurized</b> <b>milk</b> has almost completely eliminated this as a public health problem in developed countries. M. canetti is rare and seems to be limited to the Horn of Africa, although a few cases have been seen in African emigrants. M. microti is also rare and is seen almost only in immunodeficient people, although its prevalence may be significantly underestimated.|$|E

25|$|In 1892 he and {{his wife}} privately funded the Nathan Straus <b>Pasteurized</b> <b>Milk</b> Laboratory to provide <b>pasteurized</b> <b>milk</b> to {{children}} to combat infant mortality and tuberculosis. In his battles with the disease he opened the Tuberculosis Preventorium for Children at Lakewood Township, New Jersey (later it was moved to Farmingdale, New Jersey) in 1909. Their book, Disease in Milk: The Remedy Pasteurization: The Life Work of Nathan Straus records that unclean, unpasteurized milk fed to infants was the chief cause of tuberculosis, typhoid, scarlet fever, diphtheria, murno gladst and other diseases that were the main cause of a 25% infant mortality rate in the U.S. in 1890, 15% in 1903 (but 7% in New York in 1900, where <b>pasteurized</b> <b>milk</b> had already become the norm) (it is now below 1% in the U.S.). Straus is credited as the leading proponent of the pasteurization movement, which eliminated {{the hundreds of thousands of}} deaths per year then due to disease-bearing milk.|$|E
25|$|UHT milk (trajno mlijeko/trajno mleko/трајно млеко) {{is sold in}} 500mL and 1L (sometimes also 200 mL) aseptic cartons.

25|$|Pasteurization is {{the reason}} for milk's {{extended}} shelf life. High-temperature, short-time (HTST) <b>pasteurized</b> <b>milk</b> typically has a refrigerated shelf life of two to three weeks, whereas ultra-pasteurized milk can last much longer, sometimes two to three months. When ultra-heat treatment (UHT) is combined with sterile handling and container technology (such as aseptic packaging), it can even be stored unrefrigerated for up to 9 months.|$|E
25|$|Pasteurization {{is used to}} kill harmful Pathogenic {{bacteria}} by {{heating the}} milk {{for a short time}} and then immediately cooling it. Types of <b>pasteurized</b> <b>milk</b> include full cream, reduced fat, skim milk, calcium enriched, flavoured, and UHT. The standard high temperature short time (HTST) process of 72°C for 15 seconds completely kills pathogenic bacteria in milk, rendering it safe to drink for up to three weeks if continually refrigerated. Dairies print best before dates on each container, after which stores remove any unsold milk from their shelves.|$|E
25|$|For some foods, {{health issues}} are {{important}} in determining shelf life. Bacterial contaminants are ubiquitous, and foods left unused too long will often be contaminated by substantial amounts of bacterial colonies and become dangerous to eat, leading to food poisoning. However, shelf life alone is not an accurate indicator of how long the food can safely be stored. For example, <b>pasteurized</b> <b>milk</b> can remain fresh for five days after its sell-by date if it is refrigerated properly. However, improper storage of milk may result in bacterial contamination or spoilage before the expiration date.|$|E
40|$|Enumeration {{of aerobic}} {{microorganisms}} in Brazilian <b>pasteurized</b> bovine <b>milk</b> using PetrifilmTM AC and SimplateTM TPC {{was shown to}} be influenced by the nature of autochthonous microbiota. This study was conducted to assess if the same occurs in <b>pasteurized</b> goat <b>milk.</b> <b>Pasteurized</b> frozen goat <b>milk</b> (n= 62) was purchased in retail stores in São Paulo, SP, Brazil, and submitted to mesophilic aerobic counts using PetrifilmTM AC and SimplateTM TPC, comparing results with those of conventional pour-plates. Correlation indexes above 0. 90 were ranked "excellent"; those between 0. 80 and 0. 89, "good", those from 0. 79 to 0. 50, "fair", and those below 0. 50, "poor". Correlation indexes for PetrifilmTM AC counts were "good", but "poor" using SimplateTM TPC. Comparison of PetrifilmTM AC and SimplateTM TPC also produced "poor" correlation indexes. Results suggest that autochthonous microbiota have little, if any, influence on the performance of these two systems, since good correlations were achieved using PetrifilmTM AC...|$|R

40|$|Mycobacterium avium subspesies paratuberculosis (MAP) is {{a thermal}} {{tolerant}} bacteria. The presenceof these bacteria in <b>pasteurized</b> dairy <b>milk</b> {{is associated with}} infectious bowel disease in human known asCrohn’s disease. The {{aim of this study}} was to detect MAP in <b>pasteurized</b> dairy <b>milk</b> sold in Bogor. Fourtytwo samples of plain flavoured milk (180 – 250 ml) from 7 producers were bought from supermarkets inBogor. The presence of MAP was detected by isolation and conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using IS 900 and F 57. Bacterial isolation were done by Herrold’s egg yolk medium with mycobactine J(HEYMj) and without mycobactin J (HEYM) and incubated at 37 °C for 20 weeks. The DNA extraction ofall <b>pasteurized</b> dairy <b>milk</b> samples were conducted by DNeasy® Tissue Kit. Amplification conditionsfor PCR were: 1 cycle at 94 °C for 10 minutes, 40 cycles at 94 °C for 1 minute, 58 °C for 1 minute, and 72 °C for 3 minutes, and 1 cycle at 72 °C for 7 minutes. After 20 weeks of incubation, there were no sign ofMAP which grew in all isolation mediums. The PCR IS 900 and F 57 did not detect the DNA band of thetarget.

25|$|While {{versions}} are made commercially elsewhere, Cotija cheese {{is made in}} Cotija, Tocumbo and Los Reyes in Michoacán and Quitupan, Santa María del Oro and Jilotlán de los Dolores in Jalisco. These communities are in the Sierra de Jal-Mich region, which straddles the two states. To receive this recognition, the cheese must also be made with <b>pasteurized</b> <b>milk</b> to prevent food-borne illness. This goat cheese was developed in Mexico entirely and has a taste and texture {{similar to that of}} Italian parmesan. It has a light golden hue and pronounced sour-milk aroma. It is aged an average of 12 months and sometimes the wheels are covered in a chili pepper paste to prevent mold. It is usually sprinkled on dishes as an accent, but can be used to flavor pastas and salads. This cheese is also popular in the United States, where it is both imported and made domestically. However, the US-made Cotija differs noticeable from its Mexican namesake, as American producers add enzymes to speed up the aging process.|$|E
500|$|Sinko {{admits that}} the modern {{facility}} with large vats of cheese and milk processing would seem to contradict the word [...] "Handmade" [...] in the company name. According to him, all of the cheese is monitored, processed, and prepared by hand, but simply {{on a larger scale}} than most artisanal cheesemakers. Unlike most artisan cheeses, Beecher's is made largely with <b>pasteurized</b> <b>milk.</b> Dammeier believes that many people feel raw milk cheeses taste better due to renowned French cheeses, which were historically made of raw milk because the farms were unable to afford pasteurization. [...] "I've probably tasted 150 different cheeses this year, and I'm convinced that raw milk doesn't create more flavor," [...] he said, adding that his cheeses have a more consistent taste from not using raw milk. Nevertheless, Beecher's offers a raw milk version of their Flagship cheese. The cheeses they produce use no artificial ingredients or preservatives. Beecher's typically manufactures up to nine different varieties of cheeses each year, including a combination of their staple brands and various seasonal varieties.|$|E

2500|$|Pasteurization is {{credited}} with dramatically reducing pathogens found in milk. This improves the shelf-life and safety of the processed milk. Advocates of drinking raw milk claim various health benefits they attribute to raw milk that are lost in the pasteurization process, and claim that raw milk can be produced as hygienically as <b>pasteurized</b> <b>milk.</b> Raw milk advocates may {{go as far as}} to claim that untreated milk is a [...] "miracle cure" [...] for [...] illnesses such as asthma or gastrointestinal disorders. A 2006 systematic review of infections associated with raw milk contends that <b>pasteurized</b> <b>milk</b> is substantially safer than raw milk, and comparably nutritious to raw milk, therefore there is no scientific reason for choosing raw milk products. Similarly, a recent review authored by the Belgian Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain and experts from Belgian universities and institutions concluded that [...] "raw milk poses a realistic health threat due to a possible contamination with human pathogens. It is therefore strongly recommended that milk should be heated before consumption.

2500|$|Advocates of {{drinking}} raw milk claim raw milk contains desirable substances, such as enzymes, that cannot survive the heating process {{and may be}} destroyed during pasteurization; specifically, immunoglobulins and the enzymes lipase and phosphatase, which are inactivated by heat, {{are believed to be}} beneficial. In contrast, food scientists and FDA officials assert that most [...] "beneficial" [...] enzymes survive pasteurization; that those few enzymes that are present in raw milk and denatured in <b>pasteurized</b> <b>milk</b> are ultimately degraded in the low pH environment of the stomach anyway; and that the enzymes present in milk are not used by humans to metabolize nutrients.|$|E
2500|$|Pasteurization {{is widely}} {{accepted}} {{to improve the}} safety of milk products by reducing the exposure to pathogens. Opponents of pasteurization argue that unpasteurized milk has benefits associated with superior taste, nutritional qualities and certain health benefits over <b>pasteurized</b> <b>milk.</b> While pasteurization of milk kills off bacterial pathogens, other bacteria species with possible health benefits are also destroyed. Pasteurization of cow's milk destroys any potential pathogens and increases the shelf life,. During pasteurization, however, these lactic acid bacteria are mostly destroyed. A 2009 systematic review of the food safety of unpasteurized milk concluded that science-based data to substantiate claims of health benefits [...] "are lacking or do not exist" [...] and {{the risks associated with}} disease outbreaks as a result of raw milk consumption are [...] "considerably higher".|$|E
40|$|The {{physical}} and chemical characteristics and thermal stability of butter oil produced from non-pasteurized and <b>pasteurized</b> sheep’s <b>milk</b> were studied. Thermal stability of samples was estimated by using the accelerated shelf-life testing method.

The peroxide and thiobarbituric acid values increased as the temperature increased. The increase of acid values of the two samples was not significant. A slight increase in free fatty acid value showed that hydrolytic reactions were not responsible for the deterioration of butter oil samples in thermal stability studies. When compared, butter oil produced from <b>pasteurized</b> sheep’s <b>milk</b> has higher thermal stability than butter oil produced from non-pasteurized sheep’s milk. Although butter oil produced from non-pasteurized milk was not exposed to any heat treatment, the shelf-life of this product was lower than the shelf-life of butter oil produced from <b>pasteurized</b> sheep’s <b>milk.</b> Therefore, heat treatment for pasteurization did not affect the thermal stability of butter oil...|$|R
