As part of this work, he introduced normal heights, which can be calculated from geopotential numbers (obtained from <b>precise</b> <b>levelling)</b> without needing the uncertain value of gravity along the plumbline of a point, i.e., inside the continental crustal rock under the point.|$|E
5000|$|Tilting level, {{dumpy level}} or {{automatic}} level [...] are terms {{used to refer}} to types of leveling instruments as used in surveying to measure height differences over larger distances. It has a spirit level mounted on a telescope (perhaps 30 power) with cross-hairs, itself mounted on a tripod. The observer reads height values off two graduated vertical rods, one 'behind' and one 'in front', to obtain the height difference between the ground points on which the rods are resting. Starting from a point with a known elevation and going cross country (successive points being perhaps 100 m apart) height differences can be measured cumulatively over long distances and elevations can be calculated. <b>Precise</b> <b>levelling</b> is supposed to give the difference in elevation between two points 1 km apart correct to within a few millimeters.|$|E

The <b>precise</b> <b>levelling</b> network provides the vertical reference datum for mapping and engineering purposes {{as well as for}} scientific research work, which includes tectonic movement monitoring and mean sea level studies. At present, twelve loops of <b>precise</b> <b>levelling</b> which cover {{the southern part of the}} Peninsular Malaysia were surveyed, processed and adjusted. The <b>precise</b> <b>levelling</b> was made with high precision levelling instruments which are currently used by DSMM, namely, Zeiss NI 002 A and digital automatic level, Wild NA 3000. These instruments are capable of storing data in computer readable form for the purpose of processing and adjustment. Data acquired from the field were processed by RAPC- 1 and DELTA processing software. Adjustment and analysis were made using Geolab network adjustment software. For future investigations on Peninsular Malaysia Height Datum, the levelling network has been tied to first order GPS network and tide gauge" stations.

40|$|Monitoring and {{analyzing}} deformations of large structures {{is included in}} the main interest of Geodesy Science. In deformation monitoring, terrestrial techniques such as <b>precise</b> <b>levelling</b> and/or space-based techniques such as GPS (Global Positioning System) are most commonly used measurement methods. In this paper, the subject is vertical deformation analysis of a large viaduct across a lake. The viaduct is a very attractive test object with its geological and geotechnical conditions for deformation research. With the aim of determining the deformations of this engineering structure, a control network was established and four campaign GPS measurements were carried out. GPS measurements were supported by <b>Precise</b> <b>Levelling</b> Technique. Because of that the height component is the least accurately determined GPS coordinate, due to geometric weakness of system and atmospheric errors. Analysis were done according to three different approaches; at first two approaches, deformation analysis using the height differences provided from the <b>precise</b> <b>levelling</b> measurements and from the GPS measurements were carried out separately.

The new network consists of 113 levelling lines with more than 5000 bench marks and covers a total distance of over 5000 km. <b>Precise</b> <b>levelling</b> technique is used to establish the network where the allowable misclosure between fore and back levelling is less than 3 mm per root kilometre of length along a line. Its configuration is predominantly dictated by the land transportation pattern. The mean sea level (MSL) at Port Kelang, based upon a 10 -year tidal observation (1984 - 93), was later being adopted as the new Peninsular Malaysia Geodetic Vertical Datum (PMGVD). A consistent and accurate set of adjusted heights of benchmarks has been achieved in the adjustment of the <b>Precise</b> <b>Levelling</b> Network of Peninsular Malaysia on the datum defined by MSL height at Port Klang.
