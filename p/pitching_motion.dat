5|$|In September 1969, Cheyenne {{prototype}} #10 (s/n 66-8835) underwent {{wind tunnel}} testing at NASA Ames Research Center, {{to research the}} half-P hop and drag issues. The engineers {{did not realize that}} the fixed mounts used to secure the aircraft in the wind tunnel would not allow the helicopter to move relative to the rotor, as it did in flight. As a result, there was no natural damping of the rotor <b>pitching</b> <b>motion.</b> The remote controllers' lack of sensory feedback from helicopter compounded the situation. During high speed testing to replicate the half-P hop vibration, the rotor oscillations quickly accelerated out of control and struck the tail boom, resulting in the destructive breakup of the helicopter.|$|E

40|$|Lumped {{parameter}} mathematical models representing anatomical {{parts of}} the human body have been developed to represent body motions associated with resonances of the vertical apparent mass and the fore-and-aft cross-axis apparent mass {{of the human body}} standing in five different postures: ‘upright’, ‘lordotic’, ‘anterior lean’, ‘knees bent’, and ‘knees more bent’. The inertial and geometric parameters of the models were determined from published anthropometric data. Stiffness and damping parameters were obtained by comparing model responses with experimental data obtained previously. The principal resonance of the vertical apparent mass, and the first peak in the fore-and-aft cross-axis apparent mass, of the standing body in an upright posture (at 5 – 6 Hz) corresponded to vertical motion of the viscera in phase with the vertical motion of the entire body due to deformation of the tissues at the soles of the feet, with <b>pitch</b> <b>motion</b> of the pelvis out of phase with <b>pitch</b> <b>motion</b> of the upper body above the pelvis. Upward motion of the body was in phase with the forward <b>pitch</b> <b>motion</b> of the pelvis. Changing the posture of the upper body had minor effects on the mode associated with the principal resonances of the apparent mass and cross-axis apparent mass, but the mode changed significantly with bending of the legs. In legs-bent postures, the principal resonance (at about 3 Hz) was attributed to bending of the legs coupled with <b>pitch</b> <b>motion</b> of the pelvis in phase with <b>pitch</b> <b>motion</b> of the upper body. In this mode, extension of the legs was in phase with the forward <b>pitch</b> <b>motion</b> of the upper body and the upward vertical motion of the viscera. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — A quadrupedal robot {{inspired}} by the basilisk lizard was developed and modeled with a 3 -D real time simulation. Due to the robot’s geometry, leg motion, and water interactions, the net pitch moment {{at the center of}} mass is not zero making <b>pitch</b> <b>motion</b> unstable. This paper introduces two types of tails, passive and active, to stabilize <b>pitch</b> <b>motion</b> and analyzes {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} each. It is shown in simulation that a purely passive tail can stabilize <b>pitch</b> <b>motion</b> and lead to a steady state robot pitch angle in the absence of disturbances. It is further shown that an active tail can compensate for disturbances and correct any drift in the robot body pitch angle due to changes in robot running speed. I...|$|R
5|$|Rivera is {{regarded}} within baseball {{as one of}} the most dominant relievers in major league history. Pitching with a longevity and consistency uncommon to the closer role, he saved at least 25games in 15consecutive seasons and posted an ERA under 2.00 in 11seasons, both of which are records. His career 2.21ERA and 1.00WHIP are the lowest in the live-ball era among qualified pitchers. Fellow players credit him with popularizing the cut fastball across the major leagues. Along with his signature pitch, Rivera was known for his precise control, smooth <b>pitching</b> <b>motion,</b> and for his composure and reserved demeanor on the field. In 2013, the Yankees retired his uniform number 42; he was the last major league player to wear the number full-time, following its league-wide retirement in honor of Jackie Robinson. Rivera has been involved in philanthropic causes and the Christian community through the Mariano Rivera Foundation. He is considered to be a strong candidate for the Baseball Hall of Fame once he is eligible.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Rivera joined Panamá Oeste, a local amateur {{baseball}} team, {{as their}} shortstop. Scout Herb Raybourn watched him {{play in a}} baseball tournament but did not project {{him to be a}} major league shortstop. A year later, Panamá Oeste's pitcher performed so poorly in a playoff game that Rivera was asked to replace him, and despite no experience at the position, he pitched well. Teammates Claudino Hernández and Emilio Gáez consequently contacted Chico Heron, a scout for the New York Yankees. Two weeks after his pitching debut, Rivera was invited to a Yankees tryout camp run by Heron in Panama City. Raybourn, who had returned to Panama to scout as the Yankees' director of Latin American operations, received a tip about Rivera. Raybourn was surprised to hear he had switched positions but decided to watch him throw. Although Rivera had no formal pitching training, weighed just , and threw only , Raybourn was impressed by his athleticism and smooth, effortless <b>pitching</b> <b>motion.</b> Viewing Rivera as a raw talent, Raybourn signed the amateur free agent to a contract with the Yankees organization on February17, 1990; the contract included a signing bonus of US$2,500 ($ today), according to Major League Baseball (MLB) records.|$|E

40|$|A {{method for}} the {{identification}} of the damping, restoring, and coupling parameters in the equations describing the coupled heave and <b>pitch</b> <b>motions</b> for an underwater robotic vehicle (URV) sailing near sea surface in random waves using only its measured responses at sea is presented. The random decrement equations are derived for the URV performing coupled heave and <b>pitch</b> <b>motions</b> in random waves. The hydrodynamic parameters in these equations are identified using a new identification technique called RDLRNNT, which uses a combination of a multiple linear regression algorithm and a neural networks technique. The combination of the classical parametric identification techniques and the neural networks technique provides robust results and does not require a large amount of computer time. The developed identification technique would be particularly useful in identifying the parameters for both moderately and lightly damped motions under the action of unknown excitations effected by a realistic sea. Numerically generated data for the coupled heave and <b>pitch</b> <b>motion</b> of a URV are used initially to test the accuracy of the technique. Experimental data are also used to validate the identification technique. It is shown that the developed technique is reliable in {{the identification of}} the parameters in the equations describing the coupled heave and <b>pitch</b> <b>motions</b> for an URV.

30|$|The {{vibration}} {{property of}} mining vehicles is easily subject {{to both the}} vertical bounce and <b>pitch</b> <b>motions.</b> Therefore, a suppression that can reduce bounce and <b>pitch</b> <b>motions</b> {{is essential for the}} suspension design of mining vehicles. A novel HIS system is proposed herein to effectively control the bounce and <b>pitch</b> <b>motions</b> to improve the ride comfort and handling performance. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section  2 presents the description of a HIS-equipped vehicle. The modeling methodology is developed for deriving the dynamic equations of the HIS-equipped vehicle in Section  3. The modal analytical methods of vibration transmissibility and frequency response under stochastic road irregularity inputs are described in Section  4. Section  5 presents the comparative analyses of mining vehicles with the CS and HIS systems. Meanwhile, the sensitivity analysis of loss coefficient for damper valves is also given. Finally, the conclusions are drawn in Section  6.|$|R

40|$|The {{equations}} {{of motion}} of an arbitrary flexible body in orbit are derived. The model includes the effects of gravity with all its higher harmonics. As a specific example, the motion of a long, slender, uniform beam in circular orbit is modeled. The example considers the inplane motion of the beam in orbit. In the case of planar motion with only flexural vibrations, the <b>pitch</b> <b>motion</b> is not influenced by the elastic motion of the beam. For large values of {{the square of the}} ratio of the structural modal frequency to the orbital angular rate the elastic motion is decoupled from the <b>pitch</b> <b>motion.</b> However, for small values of this ratio and small amplitude <b>pitch</b> <b>motion,</b> the elastic motion is governed by a Hill's 3 -term equation.

500|$|Over {{a series}} of {{tethered}} and free-flying test flights lasting up to 43 minutes, the HZ-1 suffered a pair of accidents. Both crashes occurred under similar conditions – the contra-rotating rotors intermeshed and collided, the blades shattering, causing an immediate loss of control resulting in a crash. Aerodynamic testing was conducted in the full-scale wind tunnel at the Langley Research Center, and {{it was discovered that}} the Aerocycle's forwards speed was limited by an uncontrollable <b>pitching</b> <b>motion,</b> but rotor-tip clearance was always sufficient. The inability to determine the precise cause of the intermeshing, combined {{with the fact that the}} [...] "personal lifting device" [...] concept was failing to live up to its expectations, led to the decision to terminate the project.|$|E
500|$|In March 1979, McLaughlin re-signed {{with the}} Mariners. McLaughlin {{spent the entire}} regular season with the Mariners that year. He made his season debut on April 6, against the Cleveland Indians, where he pitched seven innings, and came away with a win. In mid-April, he missed a game after {{bruising}} his hand {{in his hotel room}} when he was practicing his <b>pitching</b> <b>motion.</b> McLaughlin earned his first major league save on June 6, against the Detroit Tigers. On July 3, he threw his only complete game of the season in a game against the Minnesota Twins. In August, McLaughlin missed a game to get married in Mexico. On August 14, it was reported by The Miami News that McLaughlin was carrying a [...]357 Magnum when he traveled. With Seattle that season, McLaughlin compiled a record of 7–7 with a 4.22 with 14 saves, and 74 strikeouts in 47 games, seven starts.|$|E
500|$|Rivera had an {{impeccable}} {{ability to}} accurately locate pitches and consistently throw strikes, {{particularly on the}} inside and outside edges of the strike zone. This strength offset his reliance on one pitch and hitters' anticipation of it. His former catcher Joe Girardi said, [...] "He was so easy to catch because he always put the ball right there. I don't think there's ever been a pitcher that great who was so easy to catch." [...] Rivera's 4.10 career strikeout-to-walk ratio in the regular season ranks ninth-best in major league history. His control was a byproduct of his smooth, easily repeated <b>pitching</b> <b>motion,</b> which some opposing hitters found to be deceptive. One such player, Darrin Fletcher, said in 1999 that Rivera [...] "almost kind of lulls you to sleep with his delivery. It gives you a false sense of security, and then the ball is on you and it's exploding." ...|$|E

500|$|Investigations {{into the}} effect {{revealed}} what was causing the problem. While {{in the ground}} effect, the high-pressure air under the craft was trapped, filling the entire area and thus providing a stable base. When the craft rose {{out of the ground}} effect, the air formed itself into a single narrow column, described by Frost as [...] "tree trunking". At intermediate altitudes the craft would momentarily transition from one regime to the other, during which time one side of the vehicle would be entirely supported while the support was disappearing under the other. This led to a strong <b>pitching</b> <b>motion</b> towards the unsupported side. As soon as this occurred that side would approach the ground and re-establish the supporting air, while the other side would then be raised above this limit. This process would repeat itself, with the craft rolling from side to side. Modifications were carried out {{in order to try to}} solve the problem. Eventually a series of 52 holes were drilled in the bottom of the vehicle, located radially three feet from the center. These were to provide a central jet to stabilize the ground cushion.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{spectral}} peak period has been evaluated by varying the spectral peak period for a constant wave height.

For the floating platform the maximum snap-load occurs for a wider range between 9 and 11 seconds. A limitation of the increased lifting potential by adding the spectral peak period in the load charts, are the maximum snap-loads occuring for the most common spectral peak periods in the North-Sea.|$|R

2500|$|Usually {{described}} as a submarine pitcher, Kim is a side-arm and under-arm hard thrower who uses {{a great variety of}} deliveries. Kim possesses a four-seam fastball with tailing movement frequently hitting the low 90s, a Frisbee slider with sweeping motion across the plate, an up-shoot slider with a rising motion, and a circle-changeup which he usually uses to strike out left-handed hitters. Nevertheless, during the three seasons between [...] and , his main problem had been the loss of right pitching balance which caused difficulty in ball control and reduced ball velocity. During that time, he also struggled against left-handed batsmen. In 2014, perennially award-winning third baseman Adrián Beltré named Kim as the toughest pitcher he had ever faced, {{due in large part to}} his <b>pitching</b> <b>motion.</b>|$|E
40|$|A novel {{kinematic}} {{mount system}} for a vertical focusing mirror of the soft x-ray spectroscopy beamline at the Advanced Photon Source is described. The system contains three points in a horizontal plane. Each point consists of two horizontal linear precision stages, a spherical ball bearing, and a vertical precision stage. The horizontal linear stages are aligned orthogonally and are conjoined by a spherical ball bearing, supported by the vertical linear stage at each point. The position of each confined horizontal stage is controlled by a motorized micrometer head by spring-loading the flat tip of the micrometer head onto a tooling ball fixing on the carriage of the stage. A virtual sine arm is formed by tilting the upstream horizontal stage down and the two downstream horizontal stages up by a small angle. The fine <b>pitch</b> <b>motion</b> is achieved by adjusting the upstream stage. This supporting structure is extremely steady due to a relatively large span across the supporting points and yields extremely high resolution on the <b>pitch</b> <b>motion.</b> With a one degree tilt and a microstepping motor, the authors achieved a 0. 4 nanoradian resolution on the mirror <b>pitch</b> <b>motion...</b>|$|R
40|$|Wind tunnel {{experiments}} were performed, where {{the development of}} the wake of a model wind turbine was measured using stereo Particle Image Velocimetry to observe the influence of platform <b>pitch</b> <b>motion.</b> The wakes of a classical bottom fixed turbine and a streamwise oscillating turbine are compared. Results indicate that platform pitch creates an upward shift in all components of the flow and their fluctuations. The vertical flow created by the <b>pitch</b> <b>motion</b> as well as the reduced entrainment of kinetic energy from undisturbed flows above the turbine result in potentially higher loads and less available kinetic energy for a downwind turbine. Experimental results are compared with four wake models. The wake models employed are consistent with experimental results in describing the shapes and magnitudes of the streamwise velocity component of the wake for a fixed turbine. Inconsistencies between the model predictions and experimental results arise in the floating case particularly regarding the vertical displacement of the velocity components of the flow. Furthermore, it is found that the additional degrees of freedom of a floating wind turbine add to the complexity of the wake aerodynamics and improved wake models are needed, considering vertical flows and displacements due to <b>pitch</b> <b>motion...</b>|$|R
