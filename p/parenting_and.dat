Higher levels of negative past of the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory were revealed, by post hoc analyses, in the group with low attachment to <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> peer.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the impact of <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> child pain responsiveness, <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> child health, <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> child pain experience, <b>and</b> <b>parenting</b> style on the main outcome variable of social competence of preschool aged children. The conceptual model depicted direct effects of the first seven variables on the main outcome variable, child social competence, as well as indirect effects on child social competence via parenting style. Participants were recruited from 66 preschools operating in the Lower Mainland of British Columbia. A diverse sample of 242 <b>parents,</b> 220 mothers <b>and</b> 22 fathers, of preschool-aged children completed questionnaires measuring <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> child pain responsiveness, <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> child pain experience, <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> child health, <b>parenting</b> style <b>and</b> child social competence. In addition, the recruited child's preschool teacher completed a questionnaire rating the social competence of the child. Teacher rating questionnaires were completed for 184 children. The analytic process employed a preliminary series of correlational analyses to determine variables to include in model evaluations using <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> teacher rated child social competence as the principal outcome variables. The main analyses involved testing and refinement of the proposed model {{in a series of}} structural equation modeling (SEM). Because child social competence was measured using data from both <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> teachers, the modeling exercise was performed separately on each of the <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> teacher outcomes. Three variables from the originally hypothesized model, specifically child pain responsiveness, <b>parent</b> pain experience, <b>and</b> child health were not significantly correlated with the outcome variables. The tested model included parent pain experience, child pain experience, parent health, <b>parenting</b> style <b>and</b> child social competence for each of the <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> teacher models. In the parent model increased child social competence was predicted by decreased child pain experience, increased positive <b>parenting</b> style, <b>and</b> decreaThe original print copy of this thesis may be available here: [URL]...|$|R

5|$|First-wave {{feminism}} was {{a period}} of activity during the 19th century and early twentieth century. In the UK and eventually the US, it focused on the promotion of equal contract, marriage, <b>parenting,</b> <b>and</b> property rights for women. By the end of the 19th century, a number of important steps had been made with the passing of legislation such as the UK Custody of Infants Act 1839 which introduced the Tender years doctrine for child custody arrangement and gave woman the right of custody of their children for the first time. Other legislation such as the Married Women's Property Act 1870 in the UK and extended in the 1882 Act, these became models for similar legislation in other British territories. For example, Victoria passed legislation in 1884, New South Wales in 1889, and the remaining Australian colonies passed similar legislation between 1890 and 1897. Therefore, with the turn of the 19th century activism had focused primarily on gaining political power, particularly the right of women's suffrage, though some feminists were active in campaigning for women's sexual, reproductive, and economic rights as well.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a description}} of a case study of <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> community involvement and the impact of that involvement on education. The study is based upon the observations, interviews, and reflections of the writer in one elementary school as a plan was implemented to increase <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> community involvement in that school. The primary methods of data collection were structured, open-ended interviews, transcribed minutes from various school-based committees, attendance logs, and event participant logs. The writer interviewed the school’s principal, four parents whose children attend the study school, five individual teachers, a focus group of five teachers, the school’s guidance counselor, two business partners, and members of the School Council. Findings from the study identified effective research-based, best practices implemented at the study school. Study results indicate that to increase <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> community involvement, schools need supportive administrators, who are willing to involve <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> community members in the decision-making process and who are willing to welcome <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> community members into the school. Additionally, schools need to provide professional training for staff in how to effectively use volunteers in the classroom, in two-way communication with <b>parents,</b> <b>and</b> in the skills needed by teachers to assist <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> community members in moving to the next level of <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> community involvement. Training programs and initiatives need to be provided by schools to help <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> community members assume a more direct and sustained role in reinforcing and promoting students’ academic achievement. Finally, schools desiring to increase <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> community involvement must possess patience and a willingness to change.
