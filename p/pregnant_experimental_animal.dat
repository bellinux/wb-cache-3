Few {{studies have been conducted}} involving long-term Infusions of oxytocin antagonists to late. <b>pregnant</b> <b>experimental</b> <b>animals.</b> We set out to de-termine whether continuous infusion of an oxytocin antagonist ([1 [...] mercapto(-(CH 2),) 1 (OMe) Tyr 2,Orn 8 j-oxytocin) would In-fluence basal levels of myometrial activity of the contracture type and maternal prostagandins In pregnant sheep. The antagonist was infused Into a uterine vein at 80 agh for 48 h starting at 139 days of gestational age. The antagonist significantly reduced total myometrial electromyogram activity and the frequency of contractures but did not change contracture duration. Antagonist Infusion did not produce any significant alterations in maternal carotid or uterine vein 13, 14. dlhydro- 15 keto prostaglandin F, concentrations. Contractures probably represent an intrinsic instability of the resting membrane potential of uterine muscle and these results suggest that oxytocin {{may play a role in}} regulating their frequency in sheep during the last third of gestation...|$|R
40|$|Methylmercury (MeHg) is {{a potent}} neurotoxin that in high {{exposures}} can cause mental retardation, cerebral palsy, and seizures. The developing brain appears particularly sensitive to MeHg. Exposure levels in <b>pregnant</b> <b>experimental</b> <b>animals</b> that do not result in detectable signs or symptoms in the mother can adversely affect the offspring's development. Studies of human poisonings suggest this may also occur in humans. Human exposure to MeHg is primarily dietary through the consumption of fish: MeHg is present in all fresh and saltwater fish. Populations that depend on fish as {{a major source of}} dietary protein may achieve MeHg exposure levels hypothesized to adversely affect brain development. Increasing mercury levels in the environment have heightened concerns about dietary exposure and a possible role for MeHg in developmental disabilities. Follow-up studies of an outbreak of MeHg poisoning in Iraq revealed a dose-response relationship for prenatal MeHg exposure. That relationship suggested that prenatal exposure as low as 10 ppm (measured in maternal hair growing during pregnancy) could adversely affect fetal brain development. However, using the same end points as were used in the Iraq study, no associations have been reported in fish-eating populations. Using a more extensive range of developmental end points, some studies of populations consuming seafood have reported associations with prenatal MeHg exposure, whereas others have found none. This paper reviews the data presently available associating MeHg exposure with development and poses some of the unanswered questions in this field.

40|$|A {{positive}} correlation {{has been shown}} between dietary intake of long-chain omega- 3 fatty acids in late pregnancy and gesta-tion length in <b>pregnant</b> women and <b>experimental</b> <b>animals.</b> To determine whether omega- 3 fatty acids {{have an effect on}} pre-term labor in sheep, a fish oil concentrate emulsion was contin-uously infused to six pregnant ewes from 124 days gestational age. At 125 days, betamethasone was administered to the fetus to produce preterm labor. Both the onset of labor and the time of delivery were delayed by the fish oil emulsion. Two of the omega- 3 -infused ewes reverted from contractions to nonlabor, an effect never previously observed for experimental glucocor-ticoid-induced preterm labor in sheep. Maternal plasma estra-diol and maternal and fetal prostaglandin E 2 rose in control ewes but not in those infused with omega- 3 fatty acid. The ability of omega- 3 fatty acids to delay premature delivery in sheep indi-cates their possible use as tocolytics in humans. Premature labor is the major cause of neonatal death and long-term disability, and these studies present information that may lead to a novel therapeutic regimen for the prevention of preterm delivery in human pregnancy...|$|R
