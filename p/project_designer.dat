500|$|Mughal-e-Azam was {{the first}} {{black-and-white}} Hindi film to be digitally coloured {{and the first to}} be given a theatrical re-release. The Sterling Investment Corporation, the negative rights owner [...] and an arm of the Shapoorji Pallonji Group, undertook restoration and colourisation of Mughal-e-Azam and assigned Deepesh Salgia as <b>Project</b> <b>Designer</b> and Director. They initially approached Hollywood executives for help, but found the sales quotations, ranging from $12–15 million, too high. In 2002, Umar Siddiqui, managing director of the Indian Academy of Arts and Animation (IAAA), proposed to enhance it digitally {{at a fraction of the}} cost. To convince the Shapoorji Pallonji Group, one of India's wealthiest companies, of the commercial viability of the project, the IAAA colourised a four-minute clip and showed it to them. They approved and gave the project the go-ahead. Shapoorji Mistry, grandson of producer Shapoorji Pallonji Mistry, thought it a fitting tribute to complete his grandfather's unfinished dream of colourising the entire film.|$|E
500|$|Major [...] Adam Foley of the 64 Headquarters and Support Squadron, 28 Engineer Regiment of the Royal Engineers was {{appointed}} to be the <b>project</b> <b>designer.</b> [...] The project {{was the first of}} its kind to be undertaken in Afghanistan and was allocated a budget of £3.5million. [...] The road designed was [...] long and [...] wide. [...] One design constraint was that the patrol bases had to be able to see straight along the route to prevent insurgents gaining unmonitored access to the road. [...] Another factor was a [...] wide wadi known as the Suf Mandah that consisted of two water bearing channels. [...] This provided agricultural irrigation for the local people and so could not be interrupted during construction because of its economic importance. [...] The design for this section included a floating roadway over the waterlogged ground and two box culverts for the irrigation channels. [...] The 17smaller culverts along the route were made from reinforced concrete and stone gabions. [...] The road itself was designed to be of unbound aggregate that could in the future be overlain with an asphalt surfacing.|$|E
2500|$|Gloster's Chief Test Pilot Bill Waterton flew with Frost in {{the second}} seat; to the test pilot, this was a revelation: [...] "(Frost was)...very much the keen English public schoolboy type. Here was another {{delightful}} contrast to England, where I {{was never able to}} find a designer with spare time enough to fly in his own creation." [...] Frost considered it important {{to get a feel for}} the aircraft and its systems. He even tested the CF-100's ejection seat by becoming a test subject himself. Early flights revealed the great potential of the aircraft but also showed the flaw in the spar was dangerous. With the crash of the second CF-100 prototype and early production CF-100s delivered to the RCAF without the final modifications to the spar, Frost was blamed for the delays and removed as CF-100 <b>Project</b> <b>Designer</b> in early 1952.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{constructability}} in the US evolved from studies into how improvement {{can be achieved}} to increase cost efficiency and quality in the construction industry. It is an approach that links the design and construction processes. Studies in the US, UK and Australia have demonstrated that improved constructability has led to significant savings in both cost and time required for completing construction projects. Improving projects' constructability {{is the responsibility of}} all project stakeholders. As design activities dominate the early project phases, design consultants {{play an important role in}} improving project constructability. Information has been collected on construction <b>project</b> <b>designers</b> in Indonesia in regard to constructability practice and its impact on the project performance. A questionnaire survey was carried out to collect the data, which were then analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The results show that <b>project</b> <b>designers</b> in Indonesia have some understanding of the importance of constructability.

2500|$|On 14 June 1947, Frost {{arrived at}} Avro Canada's Malton, Ontario {{facility}} {{with his wife}} to take over as <b>Project</b> <b>Designer</b> of the new XC-100 jet fighter interceptor. After 18 months of development, the fighter had entered the mock-up stage. Frost decided to alter the aircraft design which immediately brought him into conflict with Avro Canada Chief Aerodynamacist Jim Chamberlin. Basically [...] "cleaning up" [...] the fuselage, Frost set out to change the design subtly. Even though he wanted to use a swept-wing configuration, the prototype (by now called the CF-100 Canuck) proceeded to prototype stage in the same basic configuration of straight-winged, twin-engined form. [...] (The swept-wing CF-103 proposed by Frost in December 1950 was a transonic follow-up to the CF-100). [...] Although the CF-100 prototype was now a much more sleek shape, Frost still considered the design awkward. [...] "It was a clumsy thing. All brute force," [...] he remarked.|$|E

40|$|For {{the past}} five years {{advanced}} students have developed projects for our redesigned Calculus II classes to use. Our student <b>project</b> <b>designers</b> are often mathematically early in their careers, and so this provides them with an opportunity to create and explore new mathematics while giving us the ability to involve students of all levels in research projects.

This qualitative study examines how the second and third groups of students benefited from their experiences and how we can modify our program to improve it. Evidence was gathered from interviews, surveys, and observation of student research work and its implementation in the classroom.
