25|$|Racemic menthol {{can also}} be formed by {{hydrogenation}} of <b>pulegone.</b> In both cases with further processing (crystallizative entrainment resolution of the menthyl benzoate conglomerate) {{it is possible to}} concentrate the L enantiomer, however this tends to be less efficient, although the higher processing costs may be offset by lower raw material costs. A further advantage of this process is that d-menthol becomes inexpensively available for use as a chiral auxiliary, along with the more usual l-antipode.|$|E
50|$|The active {{chemical}} in pennyroyal is <b>pulegone.</b> <b>Pulegone</b> is a ketone and on {{the cellular}} level, ketones can act as enzyme inhibitors. The carbonyl center of the <b>pulegone</b> structure acts as a strong electrophile, causing active sites on enzymes to bind with <b>pulegone</b> instead of the target protein.|$|E
50|$|The exact {{mechanism}} of action by which pennyroyal induces menses and abortions in humans is still unknown. Studies using animal models speculate the source of liver toxicity is due {{to one of the}} many constituents the plant contains: <b>pulegone,</b> a monoterpene. <b>Pulegone</b> is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP 1A2 and 2E1) and converted to several toxins. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have found the <b>pulegone</b> metabolite menthofuran to be an inhibitor of CYP2A6, accounting for a significant degree of pennyroyal’s hepatotoxicity.|$|E

50|$|Methofuran is {{produced}} biosynthetically from <b>pulegone</b> by the enzyme menthofuran synthase.|$|E
50|$|The exact pathway <b>pulegone</b> {{undergoes}} to {{be converted}} to menthofuran is unknown, but one study strongly suggested it included oxidation of an allylic methyl group (from CYP450), intramolecular cyclization to form a hemiketal, and subsequent dehydration to form the furan. Additionally, <b>pulegone</b> and menthofuran may deplete glutathione levels, leaving hepatocytes vulnerable to free radical damage.|$|E
50|$|Study {{conducted}} on rats shows that <b>pulegone</b> can cause delayed action potential in cardiac muscles.|$|E
50|$|Study {{conducted}} shows <b>pulegone</b> damaged ovarian {{tissue in}} mice. Increased dosages correlated to more severe damage.|$|E
50|$|In {{the second}} study listed, the impact of <b>pulegone</b> on {{follicular}} growth in mice was tested. In the mice injected with <b>pulegone,</b> there was much lower follicular distribution per ovary than those not injected. Ovarian follicles secrete hormones that influence a woman’s menstruation cycle. Oestrogen levels are lower than normal when follicle numbers are low {{and it is possible}} that this can induce abortion or prevent ovulation.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pulegone</b> {{is also an}} {{insecticide}} − {{the most}} powerful of three insecticides naturally occurring in many mint species.|$|E
50|$|Pennyroyal is {{toxic to}} humans and has differing effects {{dependent}} on the volume and concentration ingested. The most concentrated and toxic form of the pennyroyal plant is pennyroyal oil. The oil contains 80% to 92% of cyclohexanone <b>pulegone.</b> <b>Pulegone</b> is the molecule in highest concentration in the pennyroyal plant, causes a variety of ailments in those who ingest it and is what causes the plant to have its peppermint flavor.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} study listed above, <b>pulegone</b> {{reportedly}} had relaxant effects on vascular smooth muscles, myometrium, the bladder, intestine and the trachea of rats. The relaxation effects on these organs {{can be attributed to}} <b>pulegone</b> blocking the ion channels for Ca2+ and K+ to enter and exit the cell, respectively. This hinders the ability of the cell to achieve it’s necessary action potential for a nerve impulse to fire, relaxing the muscle.|$|E
50|$|The endocyclic {{double bond}} found in <b>pulegone</b> {{is vital to}} the {{activation}} and binding mechanism of the molecule and causes it to be an effective hepatotoxin. When ingested, <b>pulegone</b> targets the liver and kidney, among other organs. Studies have been conducted on rats show that one of the main effects is the inhibition of contractile activity in the myometrium and death by kidney failure. Also found in the study, long term exposure to pennyroyal increased incidences of urinary bladder tumors.|$|E
50|$|Other terpenoids present only in traces are sabinene, α-terpinene, 1,8-cineole (eucalyptol), <b>pulegone,</b> γ-terpinene, terpineol-4-ol, bornyl acetate, α-copaene, alloaromadendrene, viridiflorene, β-bisabolene, γ-cadinene, trans-β-farnesene, trans-nerolidol, and β-bisabolol.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{very closely}} related to the [...] "real" [...] pennyroyal. It has very {{fragrant}} leaves and foliage. Its essential oils are high in <b>pulegone.</b>|$|E
50|$|Symptoms {{that may}} persist after ingesting a small dose (<10 mL) of {{pennyroyal}} oil are nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and dizziness. Larger volumes {{may result in}} multiorgan failure {{that could lead to}} death. There are no current toxicokinetics studies performed on humans for the effects of <b>pulegone,</b> but there are some studies performed on other mammals. When <b>pulegone</b> is ingested, it is broken down by the liver and reacts to form multiple toxic metabolites that can wreak havoc in the body. Some identified metabolites are menthofuran, piperitenone, piperitone, and menthone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pulegone</b> {{is a clear}} colorless oily {{liquid and}} has a {{pleasant}} odor similar to pennyroyal, peppermint and camphor. It is used in flavoring agents, in perfumery, and in aromatherapy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pulegone</b> is a {{naturally}} occurring organic compound {{obtained from the}} essential oils {{of a variety of}} plants such as Nepeta cataria (catnip), Mentha piperita, and pennyroyal. It is classified as a monoterpene.|$|E
50|$|In {{the third}} study, carcinomas in the bladder {{occurred}} {{at higher rates}} among mice that were injected with <b>pulegone.</b> The mechanism of action that causes these effects involves cytotoxicity and regenerative cell proliferation.|$|E
50|$|A study testing <b>pulegone</b> {{toxicity}} found inhibitors of cytochrome P450, such as cobaltous chloride or piperonyl butoxide, blocked toxicity. Such {{testing has}} not been expanded to humans, however, as the pennyroyal mechanism of toxicity is still not entirely understood.|$|E
50|$|In a study, <b>pulegone</b> {{was given}} to female rats through oral {{administration}} in doses of 0, 75, or 150 mg/kg of body weight. Individual studies lasted for 4-6 weeks and increased instance of urothelial tumors appeared as a result.|$|E
50|$|Peppermint oil {{has a high}} {{concentration}} of natural pesticides, mainly <b>pulegone</b> (found mainly in Mentha arvensis var. piperascens cornmint, field mint, Japanese mint, {{and to a lesser extent}} (6,530 ppm) in Mentha × piperita subsp. nothosubsp. piperita) and menthone.|$|E
50|$|It {{is often}} used in teas and is quite easy to grow. The leaves grow in a {{circular}} form {{and the end of}} each stem. It is grown in Hungary for essential oil and menthol production. It also contains a significant amount of <b>pulegone.</b>|$|E
50|$|With the {{limitation}} that {{the concentration of}} <b>pulegone</b> should not exceed 1%, it has been concluded that Mentha × piperita (peppermint) oil, Mentha × piperita (peppermint) extract, Mentha × piperita (peppermint) leaves, Mentha × piperita (peppermint) water are safe as used in cosmetic formulations.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{it was used}} “in {{domestic}} medicine, {{in the form of}} a warm infusion, to promote perspiration and as an emmenagogue.” Upon ingestion, one of its components, <b>pulegone,</b> metabolizes into hepatotoxic metabolites that depending on dosage can lead to organ failure, seizures, and death.|$|E
50|$|One such {{method is}} a {{condensation}} reaction of olivetol and <b>pulegone.</b> In PiHKAL, Shulgin also notes a cruder method of producing the same product by bringing to reaction olivetol and the essential oil obtained from orange peel {{in the presence}} of phosphoryl chloride. It can also be produced by reacting olivetol with α-pinene.|$|E
50|$|Peppermint {{has a high}} menthol content. The oil also {{contains}} menthone and carboxyl esters, particularly menthyl acetate. Dried peppermint typically has 0.3-0.4% of volatile oil containing menthol (7-48%), menthone (20-46%), menthyl acetate (3-10%), menthofuran (1-17%) and 1,8-cineol (3-6%). Peppermint oil {{also contains}} small amounts of many additional compounds including limonene, <b>pulegone,</b> caryophyllene and pinene.|$|E
50|$|Composition of the {{essential}} oil of L. royleana aerial parts include sabinene, β-pinene, 3-octanone, myrcene, p-cymene, limonene, 1,8-cineole, (z)-β-ocimene, (e)-β-ocimene, γ-terpinene, isobutanol, terpinolene, linalool, butanol, dehydro-sabina ketone, iso-3-thujanol, trans-pinocarveol, sabina ketone, pinocarvone, 3-thujen-2-one, myrtenal, myrtenol, verbenone, trans-carveol, cis-sabinene-hydrate acetate, cis-carveol, <b>pulegone,</b> trans-sabinene-hydrate acetate, bornyl acetate, trans-sabinyl acetate, carvacrol, trans-pinocarvyl acetate, dihydrocarvyl acetate, α-longipinene, β-cubebene, α-trans-bergamotene, and spathulenol3.|$|E
50|$|Mint {{essential}} oil and menthol are extensively used as flavorings in breath fresheners, drinks, antiseptic mouth rinses, toothpaste, chewing gum, desserts, and candies, such as mint (candy) and mint chocolate. The substances {{that give the}} mints their characteristic aromas and flavors are menthol (the main aroma of peppermint and Japanese peppermint) and <b>pulegone</b> (in pennyroyal and Corsican mint). The compound primarily responsible for the aroma and flavor of spearmint is L-carvone.|$|E
5000|$|The {{toxicity}} {{studies of the}} plant have received controversial results. Some authors reported that the plant may induce hepatic diseases (liver disease), while others found that it protects against liver damage that is caused by heavy metals. [...] In addition to that, the toxicities of the plant seem to vary from one cultivar to another and are dose dependent. [...] This is probably attributed from the content level of <b>pulegone.</b>|$|E
50|$|Racemic menthol {{can also}} be formed by {{hydrogenation}} of <b>pulegone.</b> In both cases with further processing (crystallizative entrainment resolution of the menthyl benzoate conglomerate) {{it is possible to}} concentrate the L enantiomer, however this tends to be less efficient, although the higher processing costs may be offset by lower raw material costs. A further advantage of this process is that d-menthol becomes inexpensively available for use as a chiral auxiliary, along with the more usual l-antipode.|$|E
50|$|The {{fragmentation}} to 4a and 4b {{is key to}} {{this mechanism}} because it explains the isotope scrambling results. In the reaction only half the <b>pulegone</b> reactant (2) is labeled and on recombining a labeled imine fragment can react with another labeled ketone fragment or an unlabeled fragment and likewise a labeled ketone fragment can react with a labeled or unlabeled imine fragment. The resulting product distribution is confirmed by mass spectrometry of the final product 9.|$|E
50|$|The plant, which {{contains}} a {{high concentration of}} the monoterpene essential oil known as <b>pulegone,</b> as well as isomenthol, is known for its medicinal properties. In folk remedies, it has been used in treating ailments such as abdominal pains, diarrhoea, eye infections, heart disorders, high blood pressure, weariness, exhaustion, colds and open wounds. Other usages include making a poultice from the boiled leaves and applying it unto burns and skin infections, or drinking an infusion from its leaves for relieving stomach aches, or gargling with the same for treating bad breath odors and gum infections.|$|E
50|$|The {{plants are}} valued {{by the local}} {{population}} for their content in essential oils, mostly <b>pulegone</b> and menthone, but also limonene, carvone, carvacrol, thymol and similar substances. They are used as condiments, medicinally against illnesses of the respiratory and digestive systems, and traditionally {{for the protection of}} stored tubers against pests, especially in Southern Peru. In Argentina and Peru, the essential oils are extracted commercially on a larger scale, and at least locally, this has led to overexploitation in recent years. Argentine researchers {{are looking for ways to}} protect Minthostachys or to take it into cultivation to meet increasing demand.|$|E
5000|$|Although it {{has been}} used as a salad green and in herbal {{medicines}} for thousands of years, the safety of Glechoma hederacea has not been established scientifically, and there is sufficient evidence to warrant caution with its use. Glechoma hederacea is toxic to cattle and horses. [...] Glechoma hederacea is known to contain terpenoids; terpene-rich volatile oils are known to irritate the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys. The volatile oil also contains <b>pulegone,</b> a chemical also occurring in pennyroyal, that is a known irritant, toxic to the liver, and also an abortifacient. The total yield of volatile oil in Glechoma is less than 1/30th the concentration that of pennyroyal.|$|E
