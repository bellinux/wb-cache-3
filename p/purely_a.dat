5|$|Longyearbyen {{remained}} <b>purely</b> <b>a</b> {{company town}} until 1989 when utilities, culture and education was separated into Svalbard Samfunnsdrift. In 1993 {{it was sold}} to the national government and the University Centre was established. Through the 1990s, tourism increased and the town developed an economy independent of Store Norske and the mining. Longyearbyen was incorporated on 1 January 2002, receiving a community council.|$|E
5|$|As supercells and {{multi-cell}} thunderstorms dissipate {{due to a}} weak {{shear force}} or poor lifting mechanisms, (e.g. considerable terrain or lack of daytime heating) the gust front associated with them may outrun the squall line itself and the synoptic scale {{area of low pressure}} may then infill, leading to a weakening of the cold front; essentially, the thunderstorm has exhausted its updrafts, becoming <b>purely</b> <b>a</b> downdraft dominated system. The areas of dissipating squall line thunderstorms may be regions of low CAPE, low humidity, insufficient wind shear, or poor synoptic dynamics (e.g. an upper level low filling) leading to frontolysis.|$|E
5|$|For Washington is a 1911 American silent short {{historical}} fiction drama film {{produced by the}} Thanhouser Company. The film is a fictional account of how a patriotic maid's home is taken over by Hessian officers in the American Revolutionary War. She hides her hatred of them and plies them with drink before delivering a message to George Washington. She leads them in crossing of the Delaware River and the historic capture. The film's crossing scene was inspired by Emmanuel Leutze's Washington Crossing the Delaware. The film was praised by critics, but {{the notion that the}} film was <b>purely</b> <b>a</b> {{historical fiction}} was lost on some. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

Also to simplify, no revenue is <b>purely</b> <b>an</b> accounting revenue. Actually, some other charges do not correspond to disbursement and some revenue do not correspond to receipts, e.g., accrued and deferred liabilities or assets.|$|R

5|$|The final Delrina-branded {{version of}} WinFax was WinFax PRO 7.0, which shipped in late 1995, the {{subsequent}} version 8.0 being a Symantec product. There was no intervening version 5.0 or 6.0, and the jump to version 7.0 was <b>purely</b> <b>a</b> marketing decision, based on {{keeping up with}} the suite of products in Microsoft Office which were then at the same number. It also reflected the development effort required to develop the first full 32-bit application version, designed to work with the Windows 95 operating system, which set it apart from its competition at the time.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{designed}} {{to have a sense}} of unpredictability so it can be played without confining the player to rules. To achieve this, the company added the breaching system, which adds more varieties of combat and gives players more choices when dealing with the artificial intelligence. The breaching system, which originated as a mini-game, {{was designed to}} be simple so it would not interrupt the flow of gameplay. Instead of being <b>purely</b> <b>a</b> first-person shooter, the game features action-adventure elements that allow players to choose their progression and tasks them with solving environmental puzzles.|$|E

5|$|Bruce McLaren Motor Racing {{was founded}} in 1963; Bruce McLaren was a factory driver for the Cooper motor racing team which competed in Formula One, {{the highest level of}} {{international}} single-seater competition. For two years the McLaren team had raced in the Tasman Series, a competition for single-seaters that ran during the Formula One world championship off-season, and in various sports car races. Bruce McLaren continued to race in Grands Prix (i.e. Formula One championship races) for Cooper, but by 1965 the team's performances were worsening and so he decided to build his own Formula One car to race the following year. Despite being a skilled engineer himself, McLaren enlisted Robin Herd to design the car. Herd was an aerospace engineer who had previously worked at the National Gas Turbine Establishment (NGTE) where he had been involved with the Concorde project. In September 1965 the M2A development car was completed. Powered by a 4.5 litre Oldsmobile V8 engine, it was used to test Herd's design ideas and Firestone's tyres. With McLaren still employed by Cooper, the McLaren team initially denied that they were building a Formula One competitor, claiming that the M2A was <b>purely</b> <b>a</b> tyre test bed.|$|E
5|$|Deal Castle was {{increasingly}} resembling a private house, rather than <b>purely</b> <b>a</b> fortification, and {{this led to}} arguments in 1829 {{as to whether it}} should be subject to local taxation as a private dwelling, or continue to be exempt as a military site. The captaincy had long since become an honorary position, given out as a reward by the Crown. In 1898, the War Office agreed that the Office of Works should be consulted over any external alterations to the historic castle, and that the Office of Works would be responsible for paying for any resulting work. The War Office finally concluded in 1904 that the castle no longer had any value either as a defence or as a barracks, and transferred it entirely to the Office of Works. When the captain was not in residence it was opened to visitors.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Mitchell joined a {{community}} theater group in Ellsworth, Maine, the Ellsworth Players; he eventually became its president. He was <b>purely</b> <b>a</b> behind-the-scenes {{participant in the}} group's stage productions until 1971, when director Bill Raiten persuaded {{him to take the}} role of Tevye in a production of the musical Fiddler on the Roof. His portrayal won praise, including a favorable review by playwright Samuel A. Taylor. A New York City producer who saw the show offered Mitchell a chance to play the same role in an off-Broadway production of the musical in Brooklyn. Mitchell, as the father of four children, felt committed to his financial career and declined the offer. However, he continued to act in local productions in the following years, became disenchanted with his job, and decided to pursue acting as a profession.|$|E

5|$|There {{were two}} friaries in the burgh. The Dominican Black Friars friary {{was founded in}} the western part of the burgh around 1233. The Franciscan (Friars Minor Conventual) Grey Friars friary was later founded in the eastern part of the burgh {{sometime}} before 1281. It is thought that this latter Grey Friars foundation did not long survive, but was followed between 1479 and 1513 by the foundation of a friary near Elgin Cathedral by the Franciscan (Observants) Grey Friars. The building was transferred into the ownership of the burgh around 1559 and later became the Court of Justice in 1563. In 1489, the chapter founded a school that was not <b>purely</b> <b>a</b> song school for the cathedral but was also to be available to provide an education in music and reading for some children of Elgin.|$|E
5|$|Unbiunium is {{predicted}} {{to be the first}} element of an unprecedentedly long transition series, called the superactinides in analogy to the earlier actinides. While its behaviour {{is not likely to be}} very distinct from its lighter congeners in group 3, it is likely to pose a limit to the applicability of the periodic law; after element 121, the 5g, 6f, 7d, and 8p1/2 orbitals are expected to fill up together due to their very close energies, and around the elements in the late 150s and 160s the 9s, 9p1/2, and 8p3/2 subshells join in, so that the chemistry of the elements just beyond 121 and 122 (the last for which complete calculations have been conducted) is expected to be so similar that their position in the periodic table would be <b>purely</b> <b>a</b> formal matter. Like its lighter congeners, unbiunium could be considered to begin the 7d series of elements, which would be the fifth row of transition metals.|$|E
