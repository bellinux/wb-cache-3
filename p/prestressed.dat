5|$|The {{bridge was}} jointly {{designed}} by engineering firm G. Maunsell & Partners and architects William Halford & Partners. The <b>prestressed</b> concrete design was relatively new for Western Australia, where road bridges had traditionally been built from timber frameworks. The bridge is arched along its length, with a vertical curve {{of up to}} 4% grade.|$|E
5|$|After {{duplication}} in 1890, {{the original}} lattice-girder Como Bridge across the Georges River was laid as gauntlet track. This arrangement remained {{in place for}} many decades, causing a notorious bottleneck on the line, until the New South Wales Government commissioned John Holland & Co {{to build a new}} bridge in 1969. Construction of the new bridge, made of <b>prestressed</b> concrete box girders, commenced in 1969 and was first used by the 18:17 service from Como on 19 November 1972. The old bridge, as well as a former alignment of the line between Mortdale and Oatley replaced in 1905, is now used as a rail trail for pedestrians and cyclists.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, a 48.9-foot-long {{concrete}} tee {{beam bridge}} was built; this bridge carries Hollow Ave over Leggetts Creek. In 1979, a 37.1-foot-long <b>prestressed</b> box beam or girders bridge was built; it carries Mary Street across the creek. A 44.9-foot-long {{bridge of the}} same type {{was built in the}} same year and carries Wells Street over the creek. A 43.0-foot-long bridge of a similar type was built in 2009 and carries T-422/Burcher Ave over the creek. A 43.0-foot-long steel stringer/multi-beam or girder bridge was built in 2010 and carries State Route 1027/Layton Road over the creek.|$|E
5|$|Made up of two road {{bridges and}} a railway bridge located over {{a section of}} water known as The Narrows, located between Mill Point and Point Lewis, it connects the Mitchell and Kwinana Freeways, linking the city's {{northern}} and southern suburbs. The original road bridge was opened in 1959 and was the largest precast <b>prestressed</b> concrete bridge in the world. Construction of the northern interchange for this bridge necessitated the reclamation of {{a large amount of}} land from the river.|$|E
25|$|<b>Prestressed</b> {{concrete}} balanced cantilever bridges {{are often}} built using segmental construction.|$|E
25|$|When {{manufacturer}} Houdaille-Duval {{decided to}} eliminate their Florida construction division in 1980, Gate purchased a Jacksonville <b>prestressed</b> concrete plant and five asphalt plants for $10 million. The asphalt plants were sold {{a year later}} for a significant profit. Gate then offered $1 million for Houdaille-Duval's <b>prestressed</b> concrete plant in Houston, which was worth twice that amount. H-D accepted the offer, and both concrete plants are still Gate Concrete assets.|$|E
25|$|Sleepers (ties) {{are mostly}} {{made up of}} <b>prestressed</b> concrete. Metal and teak {{sleepers}} are still in use on a few lines. This are under conversion to concrete sleepers.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{the concept}} of <b>prestressed</b> {{structure}} is widely engaged in design of buildings, underground structures, TV towers, power stations, floating storage and offshore facilities, nuclear reactor vessels, and numerous kinds of bridge systems.|$|E
25|$|A modern {{evolution}} of the arch bridge is the long-span through arch bridge. This has been {{made possible by the}} use of light materials that are strong in tension such as steel and <b>prestressed</b> concrete.|$|E
25|$|Long piles can be {{difficult}} to handle and transport. Pile joints can be used to join two or more short piles to form one long pile. Pile joints can be used with both precast and <b>prestressed</b> concrete piles.|$|E
25|$|<b>Prestressed</b> {{structure}} {{is the one}} whose overall integrity, stability and security depend, primarily, on a prestressing. Prestressing means the intentional creation of permanent stresses in a structure {{for the purpose of}} improving its performance under various service conditions.|$|E
25|$|QUINN Rooftiles {{commenced}} {{production in}} 1982, {{with a purpose}} built factory at Gortmullen, Derrylin. This first plant was commissioned in 1982. However, due to market demand a new factory built on the existing site commenced production in 2001 and was expanded again in 2005. Quinn Rooftiles is a major supplier to the construction sector throughout the Republic of Ireland. QUINN <b>Prestressed</b> began producing <b>prestressed</b> concrete products in 1984. All of these products are used {{in a range of}} domestic and industrial building applications. QUINN Lite produces lightweight thermal blocks for use in the construction of internal and external walls and the inner and outer leaves of cavity walls. QUINN Lite Pac, Granard, County Longford was founded in 1975 to produce and distribute expanded polystyrene thermal insulation products for the construction industry. The product is an expanded polystyrene board for insulating floors. A large proportion of this product is used in the insulation of commercial, industrial and domestic buildings.|$|E
25|$|In modern {{construction}} of the precast modules, there are other features to improve {{the strength of the}} structure. An example is to use <b>prestressed</b> strands on post-tensioned concrete for the {{construction of}} the shear walls. Another example is the use of carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer to replace steel wire mesh to lighten the load and yield more corrosion resistant especially for the cold-climate areas which use salt for melting snow.|$|E
25|$|Modern LNG {{storage tanks}} are {{typically}} full containment type, {{which has a}} <b>prestressed</b> concrete outer wall and a high-nickel steel inner tank, with extremely efficient insulation between the walls. Large tanks are low aspect ratio (height to width) and cylindrical in design with a domed steel or concrete roof. Storage pressure in these tanks is very low, less than 10kPa (1.45psig). Sometimes more expensive underground tanks are used for storage.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{a number}} of other bridges have been built across Raven Creek. A {{concrete}} tee beam bridge was built across the creek in 1928. Another bridge was built across it in 1950 and three more were built between 1958 and 1963. A <b>prestressed</b> box beam bridge was built in 1968. A steel culvert bridge and a concrete culvert bridge were built across the creek in 1974 and 1976, respectively and another bridge was built in 2011.|$|E
25|$|Many car {{parks are}} {{independent}} buildings dedicated exclusively to that use. The design loads for car parks are often {{less than the}} office building they serve (50 psf versus 80 psf), leading to long floor spans of 55–60 feet that permit cars to park in rows without supporting columns in between. The most common structural systems in the United States for these structures are either <b>prestressed</b> concrete double-tee floor systems or post-tensioned cast-in-place concrete floor systems.|$|E
25|$|<b>Prestressed</b> {{concrete}} {{is a kind}} of {{reinforced concrete}} used for overcoming concrete's natural weakness in tension. It can be applied to beams, floors or bridges with a longer span than is practical with ordinary reinforced concrete. Prestressing tendons (generally of high tensile steel cable or rods) are used to provide a clamping load which produces a compressive stress that offsets the tensile stress that the concrete compression member would, otherwise, experience due to a bending load.|$|E
25|$|The {{inclusion}} of the elements shown is largely an engineering decision based upon economics, being {{a balance between the}} costs of raw materials, off-site fabrication, component transportation, on-site erection, the availability of machinery and the cost of labor. In other cases the appearance of the structure may take on greater importance and so influence the design decisions beyond mere matters of economics. Modern materials such as <b>prestressed</b> concrete and fabrication methods, such as automated welding, have significantly influenced the design of modern bridges.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{de-icing}} salts on roadways, used {{to lower the}} freezing point of water, {{is probably one of}} the primary causes of premature failure of reinforced or <b>prestressed</b> concrete bridge decks, roadways, and parking garages. The use of epoxy-coated reinforcing bars and the application of cathodic protection has mitigated this problem to some extent. Also FRP (fiber-reinforced polymer) rebars are known to be less susceptible to chlorides. Properly designed concrete mixtures that have been allowed to cure properly are effectively impervious to the effects of de-icers.|$|E
25|$|Resistant to weak {{acids and}} {{especially}} sulfates, this cement cures quickly and has very high durability and strength. It was frequently used after World War II to make precast concrete objects. However, it can lose strength with heat or time (conversion), especially when not properly cured. After {{the collapse of}} three roofs made of <b>prestressed</b> concrete beams using high alumina cement, this cement was banned in the UK in 1976. Subsequent inquiries into the matter showed that the beams were improperly manufactured, but the ban remained.|$|E
25|$|A {{cantilever}} bridge is a bridge built using cantilevers, structures that project horizontally into space, supported {{on only one}} end. For small footbridges, the cantilevers may be simple beams; however, large {{cantilever bridge}}s designed to handle road or rail traffic use trusses built from structural steel, or box girders built from <b>prestressed</b> concrete. The steel truss cantilever bridge was a major engineering breakthrough when first put into practice, as it can span distances of over , and can be more easily constructed at difficult crossings by virtue of using little or no falsework.|$|E
25|$|A common way to {{construct}} steel truss and <b>prestressed</b> concrete cantilever spans is to counterbalance each cantilever arm with another cantilever arm projecting the opposite direction, forming a balanced cantilever; when they attach to a solid foundation, the counterbalancing arms are called anchor arms. Thus, in a bridge built on two foundation piers, {{there are four}} cantilever arms: two which span the obstacle, and two anchor arms which extend away from the obstacle. Because {{of the need for}} more strength at the balanced cantilever's supports, the bridge superstructure often takes the form of towers above the foundation piers. The Commodore Barry Bridge is an example of this type of cantilever bridge.|$|E
25|$|The Palm House (1844–1848) was {{the result}} of {{cooperation}} between architect Decimus Burton and iron founder Richard Turner, and continues upon the glass house design principles developed by John Claudius Loudon and Joseph Paxton. A space frame of wrought iron arches, held together by horizontal tubular structures containing long <b>prestressed</b> cables, supports glass panes which were originally tinted green with copper oxide to reduce the significant heating effect. The 19m high central nave is surrounded by a walkway at 9m height, allowing visitors a closer look upon the palm tree crowns. In front of the Palm House on the east side are the Queen's Beasts, ten statues of animals bearing shields. They are Portland stone replicas of originals done by James Woodford and were placed here in 1958.|$|E
25|$|Kings Plaza {{is located}} {{along the south}} side of Avenue U, between Flatbush Avenue to the west and East 58th Street to the east. The mall {{occupies}} 23 acres of land. The primary block of the mall lies between Flatbush Avenue and East 55th Street. It contains two levels of mall stores, along with the Macy's and former Sears/Alexander's anchor locations which are both four floors high. Both anchor stores contain around 330,000 square feet of space. At {{the south end of the}} block is a multi-level parking garage, accessible from northbound Flatbush Avenue and East 55th Street. The garage was built using specialized <b>prestressed</b> concrete columns, and holds nearly 4,000 cars. The eastern block is solely occupied by a Lowe's location and its adjoining parking lot. The block was entirely used for parking prior to the construction of the Lowe's. At the easternmost end of the site extending to East 58th Street is Mill Basin Plaza, a separate complex owned by Kimco Realty. It features Home Depot, Walgreens, and Petland Discounts stores.|$|E
25|$|MD 279 {{was entirely}} reconstructed {{starting}} in the late 1950s. The highway's concrete arch bridge across Little Elk Creek was replaced with a <b>prestressed</b> concrete box girder bridge in 1958 and 1959. MD 279's present course between Little Elk Creek and Belle Hill Road was constructed and in 1959 and 1960 and surfaced with bituminous concrete in 1962. The old portion of MD 279 was replaced with a southern extension of MD 316 on Appleton Road and by MD 823 on Belle Hill Road. The highway from Belle Hill Road to the Delaware state line was reconstructed concurrent {{with the construction of}} I-95 in 1962 and 1963. Newark Avenue between MD 280 (now MD 213) and North Street was brought into the state highway system through a June 29, 1964, road transfer agreement with the county. Finally, Newark Avenue was reconstructed and the portion of MD 279 between US 40 and MD 280 was constructed between 1966 and 1968. The bypassed portion of MD 279 along North Avenue became MD 268. MD 279 was expanded to a four-lane divided highway from MD 316 to the Delaware state line between 1981 and 1983. The highway's junction with I-95 was originally constructed as a diamond interchange. The junction was expanded to a cloverleaf interchange between 1984 and 1993.|$|E
25|$|Materials {{for wind}} turbine parts {{other than the}} rotor blades (including the rotor hub, gearbox, frame, and tower) are largely {{composed}} of steel. Modern turbines uses a couple of tonnes of copper for generators, cables and such. Smaller wind turbines have begun incorporating more aluminum based alloys into these components {{in an effort to}} make the turbines more lightweight and efficient, and may continue to be used increasingly if fatigue and strength properties can be improved. <b>Prestressed</b> concrete has been increasingly used for the material of the tower, but still, requires much reinforcing steel to meet the strength requirement of the turbine. Additionally, step-up gearboxes are being increasingly replaced with variable speed generators, increasing the demand for magnetic materials in wind turbines., In particular, this would require an increased supply of the rare earth metal neodymium. Reliance on rare earth minerals for components has risked expense and price volatility as China has been main producer of rare earth minerals (96% in 2009) and had been reducing its export quotas of these materials. In recent years, however, other producers have increased production of rare earth minerals and China has removed its reduced export quota on rare earths leading to an increased supply and decreased cost of rare earth minerals, increasing the viability of the implementation of variable speed generators in wind turbines on a large scale.|$|E
