25|$|An {{important}} microstructural {{feature of}} a polymer is its architecture and shape, which {{relates to the}} way branch points lead to a deviation from a simple linear chain. A branched polymer molecule is composed of a main chain {{with one or more}} substituent side chains or branches. Types of branched polymers include star polymers, comb polymers, brush polymers, dendronized polymers, ladder polymers, and dendrimers. There exist also two-dimensional polymers which are composed of topologically planar repeat units. A polymer's architecture affects many of its physical properties including, but not limited to, solution viscosity, melt viscosity, solubility in various solvents, glass transition temperature and the size of individual polymer coils in solution. A variety of techniques may be employed for the synthesis of a <b>polymeric</b> <b>material</b> with a range of architectures, for example Living polymerization.|$|E

Their growth in the United States and Germany was stimulated by governmental regulations originally enacted in the early 1980s for the lining of solid-waste landfills. The materials themselves are relatively thin, impervious sheets of <b>polymeric</b> <b>material</b> used primarily for linings and covers of liquids- or solid-storage facilities. This includes all types of landfills, surface impoundments, canals, and other containment facilities. Thus the primary function is always containment as a liquid or vapor barrier or both.

Degradability of <b>polymeric</b> <b>materials</b> is a {{function}} of the structures of <b>polymeric</b> <b>materials,</b> the presence of degradative microbial population and the environmental conditions that encourage microbial growth. Our understanding of polymer degradation has been advanced in recent years, but the subject is still inadequately addressed. This is clearly indicated by the lack of information available on biodeterioration of <b>polymeric</b> <b>materials,</b> particularly the mechanisms involved and the microorganisms participated. In this review, polymers are treated according to their origin and biodegradability, and grouped as biopolymer, chemically modified natural polymers and recalcitrant polymers. Selective examples are used to illustrate the mechanisms and microorganisms involved in degradation of specific <b>polymeric</b> <b>materials,</b> and detection methods used for degradation and deterioration tests are discussed.
