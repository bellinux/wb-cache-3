Despite promises by Overseas Minister Christian Estrosi that all <b>problems</b> <b>would</b> be resolved within three months, it took over six months to restart banana production, and several more to restore lost capacity.

5|$|The {{opening of}} the Green Line was {{significantly}} delayed, however, when in May 1990 WMATA fired the contractor building the Shaw–Howard University and U Street–Cardozo stations. Mergentime/Perini Joint Venture, the contractor working on the stations, had violated its contract with WMATA by reducing the workforce on the project, not meeting project deadlines, and permitting unsafe working conditions to persist. Mergentime/Perini denied the accusations. Although similar problems plagued Mergentime/Perini's work on the Navy Yard station, WMATA did not fire the joint venture company from that project. WMATA said that the <b>problems</b> <b>would</b> delay the Green Line's opening until at least the late spring of 1991.|$|E

5|$|Fermi's Chicago Pile-1 reactor, {{constructed}} {{under the}} west viewing stands {{of the original}} Stagg Field at the University of Chicago, went critical on December 2, 1942. This graphite-moderated reactor only generated up to 200 W, but it demonstrated that k was higher than anticipated. This not only removed most of the objections to air-cooled and water-cooled reactor designs, it greatly simplified {{other aspects of the}} design. Wigner's team submitted blueprints of a water-cooled reactor to DuPont in January 1943. By this time, the concerns of DuPont's engineers about the corrosiveness of water had been overcome by the mounting difficulties of using helium, and all work on helium was terminated in February. At the same time, air cooling was chosen for the reactor at the pilot plant. Since it would be of a quite different design from the production reactors, the X-10 Graphite Reactor lost its value as a prototype, but its value as a working pilot facility remained, providing plutonium needed for research. It was hoped that <b>problems</b> <b>would</b> be found in time to deal with them in the production plants. The semiworks would also be used for training, and for developing procedures.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, there are {{enormous}} positive consequences {{that would follow}} from rendering tractable many currently mathematically intractable problems.

Efficient solutions to these <b>problems</b> <b>would</b> have enormous implications for logistics. Many other important problems, such as some problems in protein structure prediction, are also NP-complete; if these problems were efficiently solvable it could spur considerable advances in life sciences and biotechnology.|$|E

Back on the field, the club had mixed results in the next six league games. Three wins, a draw, and two defeats which included a disappointing 2–1 loss away to Donegal Celtic, left the Glens sitting in fifth place in the league at the end of November, twelve points behind pacesetters Cliftonville.|$|E

The Urban Affairs Committee guided the Chamber’s urban program which set about trying to address problems identified by the Dirty Dozen. Lowe was a member of this committee. It became clear to the committee that solving social <b>problems</b> <b>would</b> require involvement from more people and a more representative group of people, but they knew minorities would never participate in an organization controlled by the Chamber of Commerce.|$|E

Houston's yearly salary of over $20 million made him virtually untradeable, and his injury <b>problems</b> <b>would</b> burden the Knicks. Houston missed 32 games in 2003-04 due to a knee injury, and despite claims in the summer of 2004 that he would be ready to play the next season (he even refused to have surgery on his knee that summer), he played in only 20 games that season because his injury had not completely healed. Knee injuries would eventually force Houston to announce his retirement on October 17, 2005.|$|E
25|$|Beside the {{economic}} plans, Stephen A. Hurlbut, (Christiancy's successor) had negotiated with García Calderón the cession to the USA of a naval base in Chimbote and the railroads to the coal mines upcountry. When {{it became known}} that Blaine's representative in Peru, Hurlbut, would personally profit from the settlement, {{it was clear he}} was complicating the peace process These American attempts reinforced Garcia Calderon's refusal to discuss the matter of territorial cession. Blaine then dispatched William H. Trescot in a mission to Chile to establish that <b>problems</b> <b>would</b> be resolved through arbitration and acts of war would not justify territorial seizures. After the assassination of Garfield (2 July 1881) and the accession of Chester A. Arthur to the presidency, Blaine was replaced by Frederik T. Frelinghuysen as secretary of state. Frelinghuysen thought that the USA was in no position to back Blaine's policy and recalled the Trescot mission.|$|E
25|$|Serious {{personnel}} problems {{developed during}} {{the first years of}} Reynolds' tenure as commandant. Most of the enlistments in the Coast Guard made during World War I were voluntary and most of the men wanted discharged from the service as soon as possible. Efforts to replace discharged personnel were not very successful even with the offer of one year enlistments and greatly increased recruiting activity. Because the enlisted Coast Guardsmen could only be held in service for three months after a formal peace treaty was signed with Germany, many of them felt they were being unfairly treated. When a peace treaty was signed, <b>problems</b> <b>would</b> be compounded by those left in the service because the pay schedules would revert to a law passed in 1908 that covered pay for the Coast Guard when not assigned to the Navy. Disciplinary problems increased during this period and were not completely solved by legislation enacted in May 1920 that equalized pay with Navy pay schedules.|$|E
