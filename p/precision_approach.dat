25|$|Because of the above, St Helena Airport was {{equipped}} with an instrument landing system (ILS) and a Doppler VHF Omni-directional Radio Range system (DVOR) supplied by Thales Group.

50|$|A {{standard}} rate turn {{is defined as}} a 3° per second turn, which completes a 360° turn in 2 minutes. This is known as a 2-minute turn, or rate one (180°/min).

25|$|The board {{determined}} the following Probable Cause for the accident:...the {{failure of the}} flightcrew to monitor altitude and to recognize passage of the aircraft through the approach decision height during an unstabilized <b>precision</b> <b>approach</b> conducted in rapidly changing meteorological conditions. The unstabilized nature of the approach was due initially to the aircraft's passing the outer marker above the glide slope at an excessive airspeed and thereafter compounded by the flightcrew's preoccupation with the questionable information presented by the flight director system. The poor positioning of the flight for the approach was in part the result of nonstandard air traffic control services.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the WAAS, the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS) did {{not have}} the ability to provide lateral and {{vertical}} navigation for precision approaches for all users at all locations. The traditional system for precision approaches is the instrument landing system (ILS), which used a series of radio transmitters each broadcasting a single signal to the aircraft. This complex series of radios needs to be installed at every runway end, some offsite, along a line extended from the runway centerline, making the implementation of a <b>precision</b> <b>approach</b> both difficult and very expensive. The ILS system is composed of 180 different transmitting antennas at each point built. The newer system is free of huge antenna systems at each airport.|$|E
25|$|On 13 January 2007, a Boeing 737-200 {{belonging}} to the Gading Sari Aviation Services Sdn Bhd crash-landed while attempting to land at 5.52 a.m. The aircraft's fuselage was badly damaged, and the landing gears and right engine were torn off during the crash. All four crew members escaped unhurt. The airport was closed for six hours while the plane was towed away from the crash site and debris cleared from the runway. Departures and arrivals of 16 MAS and 14 AirAsia flights were delayed affecting 2,200 passengers – 1,000 passengers of MAS and 1,200 from AirAsia. An earlier flight from Kuala Lumpur had to be diverted to Miri Airport.

40|$|GLONASS {{has been}} {{proposed}} as an augmentation to GPS/LAAS. We examine the incremental benefits of the additional signals from GLONASS to the availability of service for <b>precision</b> <b>approaches.</b> The methodology used for the modeling of availability {{is the same as}} that adopted previously for the analysis of GPS/LAAS. The inclusion of GLONASS signals requires provision for adapting the models of measurement errors to account for the differences between GPS and GLONASS. The main difference of significance to LAAS is due to the frequency division multiple access scheme used by GLONASS, and the resultant inter-frequency biases in the measurements. The errors introduced by such biases at the reference and user receivers are uncorrelated, and have to be accounted for in the error models. As expected, the availability of service improves considerably with the additional ranging sources. The combined GPS and GLONASS signals provide consistent and robust performance with high levels of availability of service for the most demanding <b>precision</b> <b>approaches.</b> I...|$|R

These systems include primary approach radars, <b>precision</b> <b>approach</b> radars, and secondary surveillance radar and display systems. These systems {{have a range of}} more than 120km. The AFRAS are maintained by Saab Grintek as well as Tellumat. Air Force Base Overberg in the Western Cape is also equipped with a Doppler tracking radar and is used primarily by the Test Flight and Development Centre SAAF and the Denel Overberg Test Range for aircraft and missile development tests. In the Western Cape there is a radar station at Kapteinskop, jointly used by Air Force Base Langebaanweg and Cape Town International Airport to monitor air traffic.

50|$|One of {{the primary}} {{benefits}} of LAAS is that a single installation at a major airport {{can be used for}} multiple <b>precision</b> <b>approaches</b> within the local area.
