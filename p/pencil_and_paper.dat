Most famously, a ball bowled by West Indian bowler Manny Martindale {{hit him in}} the jaw during a match in Jamaica in 1935. He was carried unconscious from the field with his jaw broken in four places. When he regained consciousness in the dressing room, his first action was to signal for a <b>pencil</b> <b>and</b> <b>paper</b> – when these were supplied he wrote down an amended batting order for his team.|$|E

25|$|Note: This {{method is}} {{also called the}} chaos game, and {{is an example of}} an {{iterated}} function system. You can start from any point outside or inside the triangle, and it would eventually form the Sierpinski Gasket with a few leftover points (if the starting point lies on the outline of the triangle, there are no leftover points). It is interesting to do this with <b>pencil</b> <b>and</b> <b>paper.</b> A brief outline is formed after placing approximately one hundred points, and detail begins to appear after a few hundred.|$|E
25|$|Rules {{can vary}} greatly between game systems; both in {{complexity}} and era. Historical rulesets {{range from the}} ancient and medieval ships to the fleets of the Age of Sail and the modern era. Often the hobbyists have to provide their own scale models of ships. The 1972 game, Don't Give Up The Ship!, called for <b>pencil</b> <b>and</b> <b>paper,</b> six-sided dice, rulers and protractors, and model ships, ideally of 1:1200 scale. The elaborate rules cover morale, sinking, fires, broken masts, and boarding. Dice determined wind speed and direction, and hence the ship's speed {{and the use of}} its cannon by measuring angles with the protractor.|$|E
25|$|Although blind {{students}} {{have benefited from}} talking calculators, the abacus is still very often taught to these students in early grades, both in public schools and state schools for the blind. The abacus teaches mathematical skills {{that can never be}} replaced with talking calculators and is an important learning tool for blind students. Blind students also complete mathematical assignments using a braille-writer and Nemeth code (a type of braille code for mathematics) but large multiplication and long division problems can be long and difficult. The abacus gives {{blind and visually impaired students}} a tool to compute mathematical problems that equals the speed and mathematical knowledge required by their sighted peers using <b>pencil</b> <b>and</b> <b>paper.</b> Many blind people find this number machine a very useful tool throughout life.|$|E

25|$|As Witmer {{believed}} in the appropriate training of these school psychologists, he also {{stressed the importance of}} appropriate and accurate testing of these special children. The IQ testing movement was sweeping through the world of education after its creation in 1905. However, the IQ test negatively influenced special education. The IQ test creators, Lewis Terman and Henry Goddard, held a nativist view of intelligence, believing that intelligence was inherited and difficult if not impossible to modify in any meaningful way through education. These notions were often used as a basis for excluding children with disabilities from the public schools. Witmer argued against the standard <b>pencil</b> <b>and</b> <b>paper</b> IQ and Binet type tests in order to help select children for special education. Witmer's child selection process included observations and having children perform certain mental tasks.|$|E
25|$|A Turing {{machine is}} a {{mathematical}} model of a general computing machine. It is a theoretical device that manipulates symbols contained on a strip of tape. Turing machines are not intended as a practical computing technology, {{but rather as a}} thought experiment representing a computing machine—anything from an advanced supercomputer to a mathematician with a <b>pencil</b> <b>and</b> <b>paper.</b> It is believed that if a problem can be solved by an algorithm, there exists a Turing machine that solves the problem. Indeed, this is the statement of the Church–Turing thesis. Furthermore, it is known that everything that can be computed on other models of computation known to us today, such as a RAM machine, Conway's Game of Life, cellular automata or any programming language can be computed on a Turing machine. Since Turing machines are easy to analyze mathematically, and are believed to be as powerful as any other model of computation, the Turing machine is the most commonly used model in complexity theory.|$|E
25|$|Politeness is {{one measure}} that {{researchers}} {{have used to}} study human-computer interaction. Being polite is an automatic response in most interpersonal interactions. When a person asks a question about themselves, most people will give a positive response, even if {{it may be a}} dishonest answer, to avoid hurting the other person’s feelings. To test this idea with human-computer interaction, researchers designed an experiment in which participants would work with a computer on a tutoring exercise. The computer would provide them with a fact about American culture and then provide supplemental information. The computer then prompted participants to take a test to evaluate what they have learned. After completing the tests participants were asked to evaluate the computer’s performance. The participants were assigned to one of three conditions – a <b>pencil</b> <b>and</b> <b>paper</b> evaluation, an evaluation on a different computer, or an evaluation on the same computer. The results indicate that participants who were asked to evaluate the same computer gave the computer more positive feedback than the other two conditions. To learn more about this experiment, see Nass, Moon, & Carney, 1999.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} and continual improvement of computers, at first mechanical analog machines and then digital electronic machines, allowed industry {{to deal with}} larger and larger amounts of data to facilitate mass production and distribution and communication, and new areas of mathematics were developed to deal with this: Alan Turing's computability theory; complexity theory; Derrick Henry Lehmer's use of ENIAC to further number theory and the Lucas-Lehmer test; Rózsa Péter's recursive function theory; Claude Shannon's information theory; signal processing; data analysis; optimization and other areas of operations research. In the preceding centuries much mathematical focus was on calculus and continuous functions, but the rise of computing and communication networks led to an increasing importance of discrete concepts {{and the expansion of}} combinatorics including graph theory. The speed and data processing abilities of computers also enabled the handling of mathematical problems that were too time-consuming to deal with by <b>pencil</b> <b>and</b> <b>paper</b> calculations, leading to areas such as numerical analysis and symbolic computation. Some of the most important methods and algorithms of the 20th century are: the simplex algorithm, the Fast Fourier Transform, error-correcting codes, the Kalman filter from control theory and the RSA algorithm of public-key cryptography.|$|E

500|$|Neverwinter Nights 2 is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} developed by Obsidian Entertainment {{and published by}} Atari, Inc. It is the sequel to BioWare's Neverwinter Nights, based on the Dungeons & Dragons <b>pencil</b> <b>and</b> <b>paper</b> fantasy role-playing game. Neverwinter Nights 2 utilizes an adaptation of the Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 edition rules. Players create player characters to represent themselves in the game, using the same character creation rules as found in the Dungeons & Dragons game. They may gain the assistance of additional party members, and they eventually acquire a keep {{that can be used}} as a base of operations. Neverwinter Nights 2 is set in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting—in and around the city of Neverwinter. The story is mostly unrelated to Neverwinter Nights and follows the journey of an orphaned adventurer investigating a group of mysterious artifacts known as [...] "silver shards" [...] and their connection to an ancient, evil spirit known as the King of Shadows.|$|E

Starting with pencil-and-paper designs from production designer Bob Pauley, and continuing through the modeling, articulation, and shading of the characters, and finally into animation, the production team worked hard to have the car characters remain true to their origins." [...] Character department manager Jay Ward also explained how they wanted the cars to look as realistic as possible, saying: [...] "John didn't want the cars to seem clay-like or mushy. He insisted on truth to materials. This was a huge thing for him. He told us that steel needs to feel like steel. Glass should feel like glass. These cars need to feel heavy. They weigh three or four thousand pounds. When they move around, {{they need to have}} that feel. They shouldn't appear light or overly bouncy {{to the point where the}} audience might see them as rubber toys." [...] According to directing animator James Ford Murphy, [...] "Originally, the car models were built so they could basically do anything. John kept reminding us that these characters are made of metal and they weigh several thousand pounds. They can't stretch. He showed us examples of very loose animation to illustrate what not to do." ...|$|E
500|$|A survey {{conducted}} by Alain Lieury, a professor of cognitive psychology at the University of Rennes 2 – Upper Brittany, indicates that working on exercises with a <b>pencil</b> <b>and</b> <b>paper</b> is {{just as good as}} Brain Age 2 at stimulating the memory.

Regarding whether or not brain training games are effective, Graham Lawton of New Scientist wrote, [...] "All things considered, it's hard not to conclude that brain training has been proven to work—under certain circumstances. [...] It's also worth pointing out that no study has shown that brain training makes cognitive abilities any worse." [...] Lawton notes that Nintendo avoids providing evidence that its Brain Age series actually leads to noticeable improvements in brain functions, and that it instead [...] "is careful not to claim that Brain Age is scientifically validated, merely stating that it is an entertainment product 'inspired' by [...] work." ...|$|E
