This method {{has been used}} to elucidate the structures of many polymers, biopolymers and protein assemblies. Extracting structural information from fibre diffraction patterns is a major challenge. A computer program called CLEARER has been developed that aids the detailed analysis of <b>polycrystalline</b> <b>fibre</b> diffraction patterns. It offers an easy-to-use interface that enables diffraction data processing, analysis and simulation of diffraction patterns. It is likely to be applicable to structural determination {{for a wide range of}} polymeric fibrous materials. CLEARER simplifies and speeds up the data analysis process and helps to utilize all of the structural information present in the analysed X-ray and electron diffraction patterns...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the development of}} software techniques for <b>polycrystalline</b> <b>fibre</b> diffraction analysis {{and the application of}} the techniques to the determination of the structures of target molecules. Fibre diffraction analysis is one of a powerful method for determining the structure of polycrystalline fibres. However, one of the main shortcomings of this method is the paucity of intensity data; the observed intensities need to be modelled using suitable methods. This particular problem is further {{complicated by the fact that}} no direct Fourier synthesis methods can be used because of the cylindrical averaging inherent in fibre diffraction patterns. An attractive strategy is to use software programs for performing semi-automated data extraction from fibre diffraction patterns using refined method of data stripping and modelling. Even though there are some software packages available to do part of this, process the best one, the CCP 13 suite, required a great deal of improvement and development. In this thesis, the design, development and applicability of such a software package, FibreFix, are described. Using several practical examples, we show how this software package has aided in solving practical structure-determination problems. Covered in the thesis are: (i) Development,of several techniques as part of the CCP 13 software for performing data stripping and structure analysis; (ii) Design and development of a new integrated CCP 13 software package, FibreFix, incorporating these techniques; (iii) Evaluation of FibreFix to show that the analysis and modelling processes in data reduction for fibre diffraction can be simplified substantially using the FibreFix software. To show this two different, but related, case studies are described: crystalline natural rubber and E-DNA. Our results show that the structures modelled by the software package are well above our threshold for satisfactory modelling. This claim is supported by very satisfactory X-ray amplitude fitness and in reduction in the R-factor of the models. We have analysed the structure of oriented natural rubber, obtaining a very good fit with the observed X-ray amplitudes and a best R factor of 0. 18. We have also analysed different possible models for E-DNA. The R-factors indicate that 172 D-DNA-like models are better than 152 models. We have a found a satisfactory structure for E-DNA, which gives a good fit with the X-ray amplitudes and a best R-factor 0 f 28 %. This project has substantially, improved the CCP 13 fibre analysis software, now all incorporated within FibreFix, which can be used for data stripping of many forms of fibre diffraction pattern. The structures of rubber and E-DNA have also been used as targets to utilize and enhance the capability of the LALS (linked atom least-squares) modelling and refinement program.

40|$|By {{introducing}} hetero-element aluminum into ceramic precursor {{and then}} sintering, <b>polycrystalline,</b> stoichiometric SiC <b>fibres</b> can be prepared. Two types of aluminum-containing SiC fibres were fabricated {{by the use}} of aluminum-containing polycarbosilane (Al-PCS). The air-cured Al-PCS fibres were pyrolyzed in inert gas up to 1350 degrees C to obtain SiC(OAl) fibres, which were converted into SiC(Al) fibres by heating in argon up to 1800 degrees C. The properties and performances of SiC(OAl) and SiC(Al) fibres were Studied by chemical element analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), tensile strength test, heat 4 C, resistance and creep resistance. These results show SiC(Al) are <b>polycrystalline</b> SiC <b>fibres,</b> have a near stoichiometric composition. The tensile strength, Young's modulus and diameter of the SiC(OAl) fibres are 2. 6 GPa, 210 GPa, 12 mu m, respectively. The tensile strength, Young's modulus and diameter of the SiC(OAl) fibres are 2. 1 GPa, 405 GPa, 10 mu m, respectively. The SiC(Al) fibres have higher thermal stability, and better creep resistance than the SiC(OAl), the Nicalon and the Hi-Nicalon fibres...|$|R
40|$|In many {{systems of}} interest, both {{physical}} and biological, disorder inhibits the organization and cooperative properties of the system. Disorder can originate {{from a variety of}} system defects and the degree of disorder also varies. Geometric frustration introduces disorder into a system in which all the preferred interactions between the elements of the system cannot be satisfied due to the topology of an underlying lattice that describes the position of these elements. Recently, geometric frustration has been recognized as an important organizing principle in a diverse range of systems from superconducting networks to neural computation. The correlation behavior of such systems is often complicated and poorly understood. The myosin lattice of higher vertebrate muscle is a geometrically frustrated system, and the presence of this kind of disorder has prevented a rigorous interpretation of X-ray diffraction patterns from muscle fibres for the purposes of studying muscle molecular structure. This thesis investigates the correlation behavior of two geometrically frustrated systems, the triangular Ising antiferromagnet (TIA) and the fully frustrated square Ising model (FFS), and its use to interpret X-ray fibre diffraction patterns. A combination of numerical evaluation of exact expressions and Monte Carlo simulation is used to study a number of aspects of the two-point correlation function of the TIA and FFS. In the case of the TIA, a simple functional expression is developed that allows accurate calculation of the correlation function. Theory is developed for calculating diffraction by <b>polycrystalline</b> <b>fibres</b> of helical molecules, in which the constituent crystallites contain correlated substitution disorder. The theory was used to study the characteristics of diffraction by fibres with TIA-type substitution disorder statistics. A quantitative model of the disorder in the myosin filament array is developed and the above theory is used to calculate X-ray fibre diffraction from low resolution models of the myosin filament array in higher vertebrate muscle. The calculated diffraction is compared to measured diffraction data, showing good agreement...|$|R
40|$|Continuous ceramic fibres are {{constantly}} finding new applications as high temperature structural and engineering materials, and {{yttrium aluminium garnet}} (YAG) demonstrates the best all-round resistance to creep. A continuous, aligned, 5. 5 mu m diameter <b>polycrystalline</b> YAG <b>fibre</b> was manufactured From an aqueous sol-gel precursor which contained chlorine, and was compared to a similar nitrate containing YAG precursor fibre we have reported previously. The precursor resulted in denser gel fibres which demonstrated better sintering at equivalent temperatures. However, the fibres formed fully crystalline YAG between 800 and 900 degrees C, a temperature 100 degrees C higher than the fibres containing nitrate, and they were weakened {{by the presence of}} many hemispherical faults present in the fibre. It was shown that both of these features were due to the retention of chloride until the onset of formation of the crystalline YAG phase, and a series of steaming experiments were devised to remove the halide before this process could occur. Steaming at 500 degrees C resulted in a poorly crystalline YAG fibre which also remained mechanically weak. It was found that steaming the precursor fibre from 200 - 500 degrees C over 3 h, followed by firing to the required temperature in air, removed the chlorine and the problems it caused {{in the formation of the}} YAG phase with out any change in the sintering characteristics or grain size.

40|$|Ceramic {{vibrating}} sample magnenometer (VSM) {{samples are}} {{usually in the}} form of a sintered monolith, a sintered pressed pellet, or a powder set in a resin or wax. The problem of mounting an aligned fibre sample, so that it retains alignment whilst remaining fixed in place as it is vibrated in a large magnetic field, was addressed for the first time. The most successful sample preparation method involved the formation of a flat, square composite sample through impregnation of the fibre with a fast-setting resin. Such aligned fibre samples had a fibre volume fraction of 3 - 4 %, but random fibre samples were also prepared, forming a much denser composite with typically 10 times as much fibre in the sample. The magnetic properties of a range of <b>polycrystalline</b> hexagonal ferrite <b>fibres</b> prepared by this method, and the effects of fibre alignment upon those properties, are currently being published in a series of articles.

40|$|Aligned {{and random}} fibres of {{strontium}} hexaferrite (SrM, Si-Fe 12 O 19) and barium hexaferrite (BaM, BaFe 12 O 19) were manufactured by blow spinning from an aqueous inorganic sol-gel precursor, {{which was then}} fired to give the hexagonal ferrite fibre. Their magnetic properties were studied by VSM, investigating the evolution of these properties with firing and measurement temperature, {{and in particular the}} effects of fibre alignment. It has been predicted that aligned ferrite fibres will demonstrate an enhanced magnetisation along the axis of alignment with respect to perpendicular to the axis, and this has been demonstrated here For the first time. The optimum firing temperature was 1000 degrees C, at which point they still had submicron grains. In BaM random fibres M-s= 63. 8 emu g(- 1) and H-c= 428. 1 kA m(- 1) and in SrM random fibres M-s= 63. 3 emu g(- 1) and H-c= 452. 8 kA m(- 1), high values for <b>polycrystalline</b> materials. <b>Fibres</b> aligned parallel to the applied field had saturation magnetisation (M-s) values equal to those of the random fibres, whilst fibres aligned perpendicular to the field had All, values 62 % and 75 % lower, for BaM and SrM, respectively. There was no change in coercivity (H-c) between random or aligned fibres of any orientation, and fibres aligned 45 degrees and parallel to H appeared identical. Therefore, properties along the axis of alignment were superior when compared to measurements perpendicular to the axis of alignment, giving a directionality to the magnetisation in an otherwise randomly oriented ferrite material.

40|$|This {{work has}} {{concerned}} the preparation and properties of all-oxide composites. The most common {{examples of such}} materials are composites of oxide particles in an oxide matrix, continuous oxide fibres in an oxide matrix and layered composites consisting of alternate layers of different oxides. In the case of continuous fibre composites, the matrix and fibres can be of the same oxide since the mechanical properties of the composite are {{to a large extent}} influenced by the interface between the two. All-oxide composites are of interest as possible high temperature materials since they are inherently oxidation resistant. The emphasis of the thesis is on continuous fibre composites. The thesis, consisting of an extensive introductory review and six appended papers (listed in appendix 2), covers a number of aspects of these composites including the properties of candidate oxide constituents, methods of composite preparation, microstructure and mechanical properties. The first paper describes attempts made to prepare alumina composites reinforced with monocrystalline (sapphire) fibres using hot isostatic pressing. The second paper reports on the thermal expansion behaviour of candidate oxides and the consequences of differences in thermal expansion of composite constituents with respect to residual thermal stresses in the composite. Paper VI reports measurements made of the stress-strain and fracture behaviour of experimental sapphire fibre/alumina matrix composites. The materials studied included both unidirectional and 0 / 90 ° cross-ply composites, all with a thin layer of zirconia at the fibre/matrix interface designed to adjust the interfacial properties to provide optimum composite stress-strain behaviour. The results could be linked to measurements made of interfacial properties. Papers III, IV and V concern the stress strain behaviour of a commercial all-oxide composite consisting of fine-diameter, <b>polycrystalline</b> oxide <b>fibres</b> in a porous, aluminosilicate matrix. In these composites the fibres were woven in a 0 / 90 ° geometry and tested in both the 0 / 90 ° and ± 45 ° orientation. The emphasis of the study was on the notch-sensitivity of test specimens containing a central circular hole. Aspects studied included failure mechanisms, the effects of notch size and the effects of high temperature thermal exposure on microstructure and strength degradation. The observed behaviour could be described successfully in terms of a simple model based on fracture mechanics. Godkänd; 2001; 20060917 (cira...|$|R
40|$|Silicon {{photonics}} is {{an advanced}} {{platform for the}} development of compact integrated optical devices. Major breakthroughs such as light generation, signal amplification and high-speed modulation have been demonstrated in silicon waveguides due to their large nonlinear effects. Recent fabrication methods have enabled the infiltration of crystalline and amorphous semiconductor materials inside silica capillaries to combine the excellent optoelectronic properties of silicon with the waveguiding capabilities of fibres. This new class of waveguide maintains many of the advantageous properties of commercial silica glass fibres such as robustness and flexibility, as well as offering the potential for seamless integration within existing networks. Furthermore, the silicon fibre platform can also be post-processed to fabricate novel micron-scale devices, beyond what is achievable in their planar counterparts. In this thesis, two forms of fibre-based semiconductor devices have been investigated; tapered silicon core waveguides and whispering gallery mode microresonators. These devices were fabricated as a unique approach to enhance the light-matter interactions {{for the development of}} all-optical signal processing devices. Improvements in the crystallinity and the optical transmission properties of polysilicon core fibres were achieved via fibre tapering, enabling the first demonstration of nonlinear propagation in this material. Moreover, different forms of resonators were fabricated from amorphous and <b>polycrystalline</b> silicon core <b>fibres.</b> Ultrafast all-optical modulation via the Kerr nonlinearity is demonstrated at picoseconds switching speeds using pure amorphous silicon resonators and in hybrid silica glass and polysilicon core resonators...|$|R
40|$|Continuous ceramic fibres {{are finding}} {{applications}} as reinforcements in ceramic matrix composites, and {{yttrium aluminium garnet}} (YAG) is a particularly attractive candidate material on account of its creep resistance at high temperatures. A continuous, aligned, 5. 5 mu m diameter <b>polycrystalline</b> YAG <b>fibre</b> was manufactured from an aqueous sol-gel precursor which contained chlorine, and compared to a similar nitrate containing YAG precursor fibre we have reported previously. The precursor sol {{was found to be}} stable at a higher concentration than the nitrate containing sol, and this resulted in denser gel fibres which demonstrated better sintering at equivalent temperatures, giving a 98. 5 % sintered YAG fibre at 1550 degrees C with a grain size of only, 1 mu m. However, on firing in air, the fibres formed fully crystalline YAG between 800 and 900 degrees C, a temperature 100 degrees C higher than the fibres containing nitrate, and they were weakened by the presence of many hemispherical faults. It was shown that both of these features were due to the retention of chlorine until the onset of formation of the crystalline YAG phase, and a series of steaming experiments were devised to remove the halide before this process could occur. It was found that steaming the precursor fibre from 200 to 500 degrees C over 3 h, followed by firing to the required temperature in air, removed the chlorine and the problems it caused {{in the formation of the}} YAG phase without any change in the sintering characteristics or grain size. The steamed fibres were of a strength and quality comparable to fibres drawn from organometallic precursors. Empirical friability measurements showed the strength was maintained after firing to 1550 degrees C, although there was a deterioration irt apparent strain to break of the aligned blanket product above 1200 degrees C. Conversely, the creep resistance, measured using the BSR test, improved with increase in temperature. The fibres fired to 1550 degrees C were fully, relaxed at temperatures 100 - 150 degrees C below that of coarser, larger YAG fibres previously reported with a 3 mu m grain size and 120 mu m diameter. However, when allowance was made for grain size, the difference in creep rates,vas within the range obtained by extrapolating previous data using lattice diffusion and grain boundary, effect models. Fibres fired to 1400 degrees C were much finer grained but only slightly inferior to the 1550 degrees C fibre in terms of creep. The alumina sol used in this work contained a significant level of sodium, and this suggests that the creep rates ape effected by grain boundary impurities, especially sodium. A sodium free sol has been procured and fur ther work is recommended to clarify the effect of impurities and improve fibre properties. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Limited. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{appealing}} {{properties of}} ceramics include retention {{of strength and}} hardness at high temperatures, chemical inertness and low density. However, monolithic ceramics fail in a brittle, unpredictable manner making them unsuitable for many applications where reliability is a key requirement. It has been recognised that continuous fibre reinforced ceramic composites (CFCCs) can show pseudo-plastic, non-brittle fracture behaviour, whilst maintaining the attractive high temperature properties of monolithic ceramic materials. Such materials offer the prospect of improved thrust-to-weight ratios, greater efficiencies and reduction of hazardous emissions in gas turbine aero-engine applications. Currently available non-oxide based CFCCs usually have an interphase between the fibre reinforcement and the surrounding matrix. The interphase consists of graphitic carbon or boron nitride which is prone to oxidation. This effect is particularly severe when matrix cracks are present and under cyclic conditions. In contrast, an all-oxide based CFCC would be insensitive to damage by oxidation, even at high temperatures and after matrix cracking. Conventional all-oxide composites also rely on a fibre coating, or interphase, to promote crack deflection and frictional sliding along the fibre/matrix interface. A more recent approach {{involves the use of}} a controlled amount of fine-scale porosity. In this case the crack deflection takes place within the porous matrix, obviating the need for an interphase, and thereby providing opportunities for easier manufacturing and reduced cost. The main objectives of the work presented in this thesis have been to identify concepts for CFCCs stable at high temperatures for long lifetimes in oxidising environments and to develop and characterise such materials. Paper I reviews commercially available oxide fibres and a literature review of chemically stable weak interphases in all-oxide composites is presented. Papers II, III, IV, V and VI deals with development, processing, characterisation and evaluation of a large diameter sapphire fibre reinforced alumina composite with a zirconia interphase. Development of two different interphase concepts is reported in Paper II: a double carbon and zirconia interphase and a porous zirconia interphase. Flexural testing was used to characterise the materials both before and after ageing at elevated temperatures. The concept utilising the porous zirconia interphase was further explored, the manufacturing process was scaled up and results from extensive tensile testing at various temperatures and after ageing are described in Paper IV. Combustor rig tests of a flat composite tile is also reported. Paper VI contains a more detailed study of the room temperature mechanical behaviour and the results were linked to measurements of interfacial properties. The problem of formation of harmful emissions in gas turbine combustors is reviewed in Paper III, followed by a discussion of different techniques to lower the emissions and implications on material requirements. An alternative processing route was explored in Paper V: hot isostatic pressing was used instead of more conventional hot pressing. Papers VII, VIII, IX and X explores various aspects of porous oxide matrix composites reinforced with small diameter <b>polycrystalline</b> oxide <b>fibres.</b> Paper VII reports on a pre-preg based processing method to make porous mullite matrix composites reinforced with alumina or aluminosilicate fibre weaves.

A review of literature on mechanical properties and processing of porous matrix all-oxide composites is given in Paper IX.
