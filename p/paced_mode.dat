40|$|Background: Empiric {{programming}} of the atrio-ventricular (AV) {{delay is}} commonly performed during pacemaker implantation. Transmitral flow assessment by Doppler echocardiography {{can be used}} to find the optimal AV delay by Ritter's method, but this cannot easily be performed during pacemaker implantation. We sought to determine a non-invasive surrogate for this assessment. Since electrocardiographic P-wave duration estimates atrial activation time, we hypothesized this measurement may provide a more appropriate basis for programming AV intervals. Methods: A total of 19 patients were examined at the time of dual chamber pacemaker implantation, 13 (68 %) being male {{with a mean age of}} 77. Each patient had the optimal AV interval determined by Ritter's method. The P-wave duration was measured independently on electrocardiograms using MUSE ® Cardiology Information System (version 7. 1. 1). The relationship between P-wave duration and the optimal AV interval was analyzed. Results: The P-wave duration and optimal AV delay were related by a correlation coefficient of 0. 815 and a correction factor of 1. 26. The mean BMI was 27. The presence of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and valvular heart disease was 13 (68 %), 3 (16 %), and 2 (11 %) respectively. Mean echocardiographic parameters included an ejection fraction of 58 %, left atrial index of 32 ml/m 2, and diastolic dysfunction grade 1 (out of 4). Conclusions: In patients with dual chamber pacemakers in AV sequentially <b>paced</b> <b>mode</b> and normal EF, electrocardiographic P-wave duration correlates to the optimal AV delay by Ritter's method by a factor of 1. 26...|$|E

PurposeAssessing the effects of biventicular (Bi V), left ventricular (LV) epicardial pacing and right ventricular endocardial pacing (RV) on QT intervals (QT end, QT apex, JT) and transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR) in patients with heart failure having CRT. Methods 20 patients (15 men and 5 women, age = 63. 4 ± 11 years) with NYHA III-IV heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction and cardiac dyssynchrony received CRT.

Background. Impedance cardiography permits continuous noninvasive monitoring of hemodynamic variables on a beat to beat basis. Methods. Eleven patients with a DDD pacemaker were evaluated by impedance cardiography. Stroke volume, cardiac output and total peripheral resistance were assessed in the supine rest position during both DDD and ventricular (VVI) pacing. Hemodynamic variables were measured during DDD pacing at rates ranging from 60 to 110 beats/min in 10 -beats/min increments with programmed AV delay varying from 50 to 250 ms in 50 -ms increments. When the pacemaker was reprogrammed to the VVI <b>pacing</b> <b>mode,</b> these measurements were repeated at the same pacing rates. Results. Cardiac output measurements during programmed conditions were found to be highly reproducible. The mean coefficient of variation was 3 % during DDD pacing; it was 6 % in the VVI <b>pacing</b> <b>mode.</b> A large decrease in cardiac output (≈ 30 %) was found when i pacemaker was reprogrammed from the DDD to the VVI <b>pacing</b> <b>mode.</b> At DDD <b>pacing</b> rates between 70 to 110 beats/min, the highest cardiac output occurred at an average AV delay of < 120 ms from atrial stimulus to ventricular stimulus. At an average AV delay of ≥ 200 ms, the cardiac output in the DDD and VVI <b>pacing</b> <b>modes</b> was similar. Conclusions. 1) Impedance cardiography allows highly reproducible noninvasive assessments of cardiac output in pacemaker patients; 2) inappropriate programming of the AV interval in patients with atrial and ventricular pacing can decrease cardiac output significantly, and the extent of the decrease is similar to or less than that observed in ventricular pacing; 3) hemodynamic measurements obtained with impedance cardiography can facilitate optimal programming of pacemaker variables...|$|R

BI pacing with 2 mm interelectrode spacing has not been compared to unipolar (UNI) pacing in scared ventricular myocardium. MethodsNineteen pts (18 M, 63 ± 12 yo, LVEF: 33 ± 12 %) referred for scar-related VT ablation were studied.

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThis study {{analyzes}} {{the relationship between}} <b>pacing</b> <b>mode</b> and long-term survival in {{a large group of}} very elderly patients (≥ 80 years old). BACKGROUNDThe relationship between <b>pacing</b> <b>mode</b> and long-term survival is not clear. Because the number of very elderly who are candidates for pacing is increasing, issues related to pacemaker (PM) use in the elderly have important clinical and economic implications. METHODSWe retrospectively reviewed 432 patients (mean age, 84. 5 ± 3. 9 years) who received their initial PM (ventricular in 310 and dual chamber in 122) between 1980 and 1992. Follow-up was complete (3. 5 ± 2. 6 years). Observed survival was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Age- and gender-matched cohorts from the Minnesota population were used for expected survival. Log-rank test and Cox regression hazard model were used for univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTSPatients with ventricular PMs appeared to have poor overall survival compared with those with dual-chamber PMs. Observed survival after PM implantation in high grade atrioventricular block (AVB) patients was significantly worse than expected survival of the age- and gender-matched population (p < 0. 0001), whereas observed survival of patients with sinus node dysfunction was not significantly different from expected survival of the matched population (p = 0. 413). By univariate analysis, ventricular pacing in patients with AVB appeared to be associated with poor survival compared with dual-chamber pacing (hazard ratio [HR] 2. 08; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 33 to 3. 33). After multivariate analysis, this difference was no longer significant (HR 1. 41; 95 % CI 0. 88 to 2. 27). Independent predictors of all-cause mortality were number of comorbid illnesses, New York Heart Association functional class, left ventricular depression and older age at implant. <b>Pacing</b> <b>mode</b> was not an independent predictor of overall survival. Older age at implantation, diabetes mellitus, dementia, history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and earlier year of implantation were independent predictors of ventricular pacemaker selection. CONCLUSIONSAfter PM implantation, long-term survival among very elderly patients was not affected by <b>pacing</b> <b>mode</b> after correction of baseline differences. Selection bias was present in <b>pacing</b> <b>mode</b> in the very elderly, with ventricular pacing selected for sicker and older patients, perhaps partly explaining the apparent “beneficial impact on survival” observed with dual-chamber pacing...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{relation}} of pacing rate to physiologic variables of metabolic demand was examined in 10 consecutive {{patients with a}} minute ventilation-sensing, rate-modulating ventricular pacemaker implanted for complete heart block. All patients had paroxysmal (seven patients) or chronic (three patients) atrial fibrillation and were referred for catheter ablation of the atrioventricular junction. Treadmill exercise testing with measurement of expired gas exchange and respiratory flow was performed before ablation and 4 weeks after pacemaker implantation, with the pacemaker programmed to both the fixed-rate VVI and rate-modulating minute ventilation VVIR <b>pacing</b> <b>modes</b> in random sequence. The {{relation of}} pacing rate to oxygen consumption (V̇O 2), expired carbon dioxide concentration (V̇CO 2), respiratory quotient, tidal volume, respiratory rate and minute ventilation was determined during exercise in the rate-modulating minute ventilation <b>pacing</b> <b>mode.</b> <b>Pacing</b> rate was highly correlated with minute ventilation (r = 0. 89), respiratory quotient (r = 0. 89), V̇CO 2 (r = 0. 87), tidal volume (r = 0. 87), V̇O 2 (r = 0. 84) and respiratory rate (r = 0. 84). The mean exercise duration increased from 8. 3 ± 2. 8 min in the fixed rate <b>pacing</b> <b>mode</b> to 10. 2 ± 3. 4 min in the rate-modulating, minute ventilation mode (p = 0. 0001). The maximal V̇O 2 increased from 13. 4 ± 3. 4 to 16. 3 ± 4. 1 cc/kg per min (p = 0. 0004). The maximal heart rate achieved in the minute ventilation <b>pacing</b> <b>mode</b> was 136 ± 9. 7 beats/min, similar to that observed in the patient's intrinsic cardiac rhythm before ablation (134. 9 ± 30. 1 beats/min, p = NS). Isoproterenol infusion at rates of 1 and 2 μg/min produced no change in pacing rate, suggesting that the rate-modulating algorithm of the pacemaker was capable of discriminating changes in transthoracic impedance related to respiration from those related to right ventricular stroke volume. Thus, rate-modulating pacemakers that measure minute ventilation by transthoracic impedance provide increases in pacing rate during exercise that closely parallel physiologic variables of metabolic demand...|$|R

However, only limited independent data on the longevity of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) are available. OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine ICD device longevity and influencing factors. METHODS: From a prospective database, we studied overall device longevity and identified those devices with replacement for battery depletion or prolonged charge time. For every device, we determined factors that included averaged shocks, <b>pacing</b> percentage, <b>pacing</b> <b>mode,</b> device size, and time of implant. Survival probabilities at different time intervals were calculated, and Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were used. Observed longevity was compared to industry-projected longevity obtained from product performance reports. RESULTS: A total of 644 ICDs (Medtronic 317, Guidant 189, St. Jude 118, Intermedics 20) were implanted in 499 patients. During follow-up, 163 (25. 3 %) ICDs were replaced.

Survival was further analyzed, stratified by both age and <b>pacing</b> <b>mode</b> as shown below:AgePacing mode (n) Probability of Survival 1 %) Log Rank p 1 yr 3 yr 5 yr≥ 80 Dual (51) 9682640. 0014 Single (166) 816144 < 80 Dual (155) 8878670. 3556 Single (259) 907759 When the interaction between <b>pacing</b> <b>mode</b> and age was included in the multivariate proportional hazard model, there was a clear trend of interaction (X 2 = 3, 46, p= 0. 06). These findings suggest that beneficial effects of dual chamber pacing on long-term survival may be greater in older patients. Selection of dual chamber pacing should be considered in the elderly...|$|R
40|$|Objective—To {{investigate}} the platelet activation in different <b>modes</b> of <b>pacing</b> in patients implanted with dual chamber rate adaptive pacemaker (DDDR) for bradyarrhythmias, {{and to explore}} the possible underlying mechanism of the higher thromboembolic incidence in single chamber ventricular rate adaptive (VVIR) pacing.  Design—Platelet activation was determined in chronically paced patients during three different <b>pacing</b> <b>modes</b> (VVIR, DDD, and DDDR) in a randomised crossover fashion.  Setting—Pacemaker clinic at a university teaching hospital.  Patients— 15 patients with complete heart block, mean (SD) age 63  (10) years, and 12  patients with sick sinus syndrome, mean age 68  (9) years, implanted with DDDR pacemakers.  Main outcome measures—Platelet activation was assessed by measuring the plasma concentrations of platelet factor 4  (PF 4) and β thromboglobulin using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Mean log plasma PF 4 and β thromboglobulin values were compared in paced patients during different <b>pacing</b> <b>modes</b> and with control.  Results—Compared with controls, patients paced in DDDR, DDD, and VVIR modes had higher mean log plasma concentrations of PF 4 (0. 90  (0. 32), 0. 92  (0. 29), and 1. 12  (0. 33) v 0. 61  (0. 29) log IU/ml, all p    0. 05) and β thromboglobulin (r = 0. 007,  0. 01, and 0. 001, respectively, all p >  0. 05).  Conclusions—Single chamber ventricular pacing was associated with enhanced spontaneous systemic platelet activation compared with physiological dual chamber pacing.

50|$|Pacemaker {{syndrome}} {{is a disease}} that represents the clinical consequences of suboptimal atrioventricular (AV) synchrony or AV dyssynchrony, regardless of the <b>pacing</b> <b>mode,</b> after pacemaker implantation.It is an iatrogenic disease—an adverse effect resulting from medical treatment—that is often underdiagnosed. In general, the symptoms of the syndrome are a combination of decreased cardiac output, loss of atrial contribution to ventricular filling, loss of total peripheral resistance response, and nonphysiologic pressure waves.|$|R
40|$|A {{pacemaker}} is {{a medical}} device that uses electrical impulses, delivered by electrodes contracting the heart muscles, to regulate the beating of the heart. The primary purpose of a pacemaker is to maintain an adequate heart rate, either because the heart’s natural pacemaker is not fast enough, or there is a block in the heart’s electrical conduction system. Modern pacemakers are externally programmable and allow the cardiologist to select the optimum <b>pacing</b> <b>modes</b> for individual patients.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} whether plasma {{atrial natriuretic factor}} (ANF) follows a pattern of circadian variation {{similar to that of}} other hormones in patients paced under VVI and DDD <b>pacing</b> <b>modes</b> and to determine if the known effect of <b>pacing</b> <b>mode</b> on ANF secretion is maintained throughout the 24 hour period. PATIENTS AND DESIGN: 20 patients were studied. They had complete atrioventricular block and had been paced for 17 (SD 3. 5) months with a dual chamber multiprogrammable pacemaker. They were divided into two groups according to the duration of pacing in either VVI or DDD mode before the measurements: group A, n = 11 (8 men, 3 women, aged 65 (7) years), each paced for 24 h under each of VVI and DDD modes in random order; group B, n = 9 (7 men, 2 women, aged 63 (8) years), each paced for 60 d under each <b>pacing</b> <b>mode</b> before the measurements. Blood samples were taken and ANF concentrations measured every 4 h over a 24 h period, starting at 09. 00. Measurements were also made of plasma cortisol, which has a known circadian pattern, so that the 24 h curve could be compared with that of ANF. RESULTS: In contrast to cortisol, ANF values indicated a pulsatile pattern of secretion throughout the 24 h period, with no clear circadian variation. In group B, ANF concentrations were significantly higher during VVI than during DDD pacing throughout the 24 h period, whereas in group A this difference was statistically significant only at certain times of day. CONCLUSIONS: ANF does not show the circadian pattern of variation shown by cortisol and other hormones. Dual chamber pacing contributes to an improvement not only in cardiac haemodynamics but also in the neuroendocrine system, especially in the long term...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTo {{determine}} {{the effect of}} ventricular function on the exercise hemodynamics of variable rate pacing, 16 selected patients underwent paired, double-blind, randomized exercise tests in single rate demand (VVI) or variable rate (VVIR) <b>pacing</b> <b>modes.</b> Ejection fraction and cardiac index were determined by two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography at baseline and during peak exercise. Baseline ejection fraction ranged from 14 to 73 % and was < 40 % in 6 patients (Group 1) and ≥ 40 % in 10 patients (Group 2). Duration of exercise was longer during the VVIR mode (502 s) than during the VVI mode (449 s) (p < 0. 01) and unrelated to baseline ejection fraction. Heart rate during exercise increased 9 % in the VVI mode and 35 % in the VVIR mode (p < 0. 005). Cardiac index increased 49 % in the VVI mode and 83 % in the VVIR mode. Analysis of variance for repeated measures showed a significant effect of <b>pacing</b> <b>mode</b> (p < 0. 01) and exercise (p < 0. 001), but not baseline ejection fraction, on cardiac index. Baseline ejection fraction did not correlate with the increase in cardiac index in either <b>pacing</b> <b>mode</b> or with the difference in increase between modes. There {{was no significant difference between}} Groups 1 and 2 in exercise duration, peak heart rate-blood pressure (rate-pressure) product, baseline or peak heart rate or baseline or peak cardiac index. Therefore, in selected patients, VVIR pacing during exercise results in an increase in heart rate, duration of exercise and cardiac index that is unrelated to the degree of baseline left ventricular dysfunction. These data have clinical implications for the use of variable rate pacemakers in patients with abnormalities of ventricular function...|$|R
40|$|Background: Though {{patients}} with sick sinus syndrome theoretically need an atrial pacemaker only, they usually receive a ventricular or a dual-chamber pacemaker because of possible developement of atrioventricular conduction abnormalities. Right ventricular pacing produces left bundle branch block (i. e. pacing-induced ventricular desynchronization), promoting heart failure and atrial fibrillation. This {{problem can be}} solved by a special <b>pacing</b> <b>mode</b> which on one hand preserves the safety of dual-chamber pacing {{and on the other}} hand minimizes right ventricular pacing. </p...|$|R
