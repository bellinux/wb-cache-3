40|$|The {{current study}} has two aims: (1) {{to look at}} people's recall of risk {{information}} after genetic counselling and (2) to determine the impact <b>of</b> receiving <b>an</b> <b>audiotape</b> <b>of</b> the genetic consultation on level of recall, cancer related worry, and women's uptake of risk management methods. Using a prospective randomised controlled design, subjects receiving <b>an</b> <b>audiotape</b> were compared with a standard consultation group. Participants were drawn from attenders at the genetic clinics of two London hospitals and included 115 women with {{a family history of}} breast cancer. Assessment of perceived genetic risk, mental health, cancer worry, and health behaviour was made before counselling at the clinic (baseline) and by postal follow up. Usefulness <b>of</b> <b>audiotapes</b> and satisfaction with the clinical service was assessed by study specific measures. The data indicate that cancer worry is reduced by provision <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>audiotape</b> <b>of</b> the genetic consultation. Recall of the genetic risk figure, however, is not affected by provision <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>audiotape</b> and neither is it related to women's overall perception of being more or less at risk of breast cancer than the average woman. Forty-one percent of women accurately recalled their personal risk of breast cancer at one month follow up; however, 25 % overestimated, 11 % underestimated, and 23 % could not remember or did not know their breast cancer risk. Recall of the risk figure is more accurate when the clinical geneticist has given this to the woman as an odds ratio rather than in other formats. Subsequent health behaviour is unaffected by whether women have <b>an</b> <b>audiotape</b> record <b>of</b> their genetic consultation. Results suggest that having a precise risk figure may be less important than women taking away from the consultation an impression that something can be offered to help them manage that risk. Provision <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>audiotape</b> <b>of</b> the consultation is of limited usefulness. The need for psychological care to be better integrated into genetic counselling at cancer family clinics was highlighted by the study. The results are discussed in terms of future service development...|$|R

The performance was the culmination of my study of the Dichterliebe, in particular, and of my voice studies, in general. Through the performance, I set out to share the wonderful music and poetry of the Dichterliebe as well as share my musical and vocal growth over the past four years. The written portion of the project was undertaken to satisfy my personal curiosity of the men who wrote the music and the poetry of the Dichterliebe. A study of the music without knowing the man who composed it or the man who wrote the words would be only half complete at best. Likewise, a study of the men and not the music would also be incomplete. That is why I included both venues of learning and experiencing in this project; and that is why I have included <b>an</b> <b>audiotape</b> <b>of</b> the performance with this written report.

40|$|This {{systematic}} review investigates which interventions are effective to improve recall of medical information in cancer patients. A literature research {{was done in}} PubMed, PsychINFO, CINAHL and Cochrane Library, following the guidelines of the Cochrane Collaboration. The methodological quality of selected studies was assessed independently by two reviewers. The results were synthesized with a Best Evidence Synthesis. Of initially 5173 found publications, 10 met all selection criteria. The results indicate that <b>an</b> <b>audiotape</b> <b>of</b> the patients' own consultation has added value upon oral information only. However, providing patients with <b>a</b> general <b>audiotape</b> does not improve recall of information and might even inhibit patients' recall. Furthermore, there is scientific evidence, although limited, {{that the use of}} a question prompt sheet (QPS) has a positive effect on recall of information, provided that the physician actively endorses this sheet. No evidence was found for an effect of providing patients with a summary letter of the consultation on recall, although research on this subject is scarce. In conclusion, the review suggests that interventions that are tailored to the individual cancer patient, such as <b>an</b> <b>audiotape</b> <b>of</b> the consultation or a QPS, are most effective. Further research {{needs to be done to}} establish robust results. (aut. ref. ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Gaining {{insight into}} the {{experiences}} of physicians and patients who were provided with <b>an</b> <b>audiotape</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> oncological consultation. DESIGN: Questionnaire study. SETTING: Academic Medical Hospital, Amsterdam. METHOD: Consultations with 30 consecutive patients referred to the gynaecology or urology outpatient clinic for an initial consultation regarding the diagnosis and (or) treatment policy were taped. Afterwards, patients took the tapes home. The following week they were phoned and asked {{what they had done}} with the tape and how they appreciated the intervention. By means of a questionnaire the physicians (n = 6) were asked about their experiences. RESULTS: Two patient could not be reached. Twenty-three out of 28 patients had listened to the tape, mostly together with others (spouse, relatives). Twenty-six out of 28 patients were positive about implementation of this intervention. According to most patients the tape contained information they had forgotten. Most patients found the tape contained reassuring information. Physicians regarded the optimal transmission of information achieved by this intervention as an advantage. Three out of six saw possible misinterpretation of the imparted information as a disadvantage. For some physicians, the taping of consultations led to more careful phrasing. Most physicians saw no logistical difficulties. In general, participation in the study did not take any extra time. CONCLUSION: This first study shows that both cancer patients and physicians find it useful to provide patients with <b>an</b> <b>audiotape</b> <b>of</b> the initial consultatio...|$|R
