According to {{a report}} of the Secretary of War, there were {{on the first day of}} March, 1865, 965,000 men on the army <b>pay-rolls.</b> Of these, some 200,000--artillery, cavalry, and infantry--made up from the larger portion of the {{veterans}} of Grant and Sherman, marched by the President. The total number of Union troops enlisted during the war was 2,668,000.|$|R

60|$|Nor {{was it the}} <b>pay-roll</b> {{only that}} claimed Jimmy's attention. He found that several handlings of {{materials}} could be eliminated by the adoption of simple changes, and that a rearrangement {{of some of the}} machines removed the necessity for long hauls from one part of the shop to another. After an evening with the little volume he had purchased for twenty-five cents in the second-hand bookshop he ordered changes that enabled him to cut five men from the <b>pay-roll</b> {{and at the same time}} do the work more expeditiously and efficiently.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{handle the}} pay-roll," [...] replied Everett a trifle peevishly. [...] "Shortly after Mr. Bince was made {{assistant}} general manager a new rule was promulgated, {{to the effect that}} all salaries and wages were to be considered as confidential and that no one but the {{assistant general manager}} would handle the <b>pay-rolls.</b> All I know is the amount of the weekly check. He hires and fires everybody and pays everybody." ...|$|R

Voucher payments and <b>pay-rolls</b> are not referred to in the discussion of department stores, but are described in connection with gas companies as if particularly connected with the latter industry. The chapter on municipal accounts is the least satisfactory; that on department stores is particularly clear and interesting." ...|$|R

"Walk in, Sergeant, walk in, my good friend," [...] said old Lundie heartily, as his {{inferior}} {{stood in}} a respectful attitude {{at the door of}} a sort of library and bedroom into which he had been ushered;--"walk in, and take a seat on that stool.

6000|$|Boone May was one {{of these}} avengers. When I {{employed}} him, as a messenger, he was under indictment for murder. He had trailed a [...] "road agent" [...] across, the Bad Lands for hundreds of miles, brought him back to within a few miles of Deadwood and picketed him out for the night. The desperate man, tied as he was, had attempted to escape, and May found it expedient to shoot and bury him. The grave by the roadside is perhaps still pointed out to the curious. May gave himself up, was formally charged with murder, released on his own recognizance, and I had to give him leave of absence to go to court and be acquitted. Some of the New York directors of my company having been good enough to signify their disapproval of my action in employing [...] "such a man," [...] I could do no less than make some recognition of their dissent, and thenceforth he was borne upon the <b>pay-rolls</b> as [...] "Boone May, Murderer."

40|$|Germany has {{advanced}} {{to the position of}} a key destination for Indian multinational enterprises in their spirited pursuit of growth opportunities overseas. In 2008, Indian firms invested an estimated amount of US$ 1. 8 billion in Germany while 16 acquisitions by Indian firms were monitored, up from 7 in 2007. In fact, Indian FDI stock in Germany seems to have surpassed German FDI stock in India. Our research shows that, as of October 2008, 123 Indian MNEs with 167 subsidiaries were active in Germany and had approx. 20, 000 full-time employees on their <b>pay-rolls.</b> However, there has been hardly any independent, academic research, so far, on Indian investments in Germany, especially on the motives, experiences, and employment effects on the host and home economies. The present study, presumably the only empirical study of Indian firms overseas to date, provides unique insights into the motives, operations, experiences, and future plans of Indian firms. It shows that Indian firms have generally performed well and intend to further strengthen their operations, including in research & development activities, in Germany. Nonetheless, firms are also faced with several challenges, including but certainly not limited to cross-cultural issues, which need to be mastered. There are also sectoral differences in the motives, experiences, and location selection criteria of Indian MNEs.

60|$|Jimmy {{turned and}} left the room. He was {{on the point of}} going to Compton's office and asking for {{authority}} to see the <b>pay-roll,</b> and then {{it occurred to him that}} Compton would probably not take sides against his assistant general manager and future son-in-law.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{tell you}} again," [...] said Bince, [...] "once and for all, that you don't see the <b>pay-roll</b> nor {{anything}} else connected with my office, {{and you will}} oblige me by not bothering me any longer. As I told you when you first came in, I am very busy." ...|$|E
60|$|But in the Klondike, {{such was}} its hilarious sorrow at the {{departure}} of its captain, that for twenty-four hours no wheels revolved.

6000|$|... "I didn't," [...] {{answered}} Wyllard. [...] "I {{went back}} to the mine, but several things suggested that the name upon the <b>pay-roll</b> wasn't his real one. He began a broken message the night he died, but the hemorrhage cut him off in the middle of it. The wish that I should tell his people somehow was in his eyes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can't! Impossible! What in hell do {{you think}} I'm running? A home for feeble-minded? Feeding and {{dressing}} and wiping the little noses of a lot of idiots that can't take care of themselves? Not on your life. I'm hustling, and now's the time that everybody that works for me has got to hustle. I want no fair-weather birds holding down my office chairs or anything else. This is nasty weather, damn nasty weather, and they've got to buck into it just like me. There are ten thousand men out of work in Oakland right now, and sixty thousand more in San Francisco. Your nephew, and everybody else on your <b>pay-roll,</b> can do as I say right now or quit. Savvee? If any of them get stuck, you go around yourself and guarantee their credit with the butchers and grocers. And you trim down that <b>pay-roll</b> accordingly. I've been carrying a few thousand folks that'll have to carry themselves for a while now, that's all." ...|$|E
6000|$|Unlike {{most other}} plants the International Machine Company paid on Monday, {{and it was}} on the Monday {{following}} his assumption of his new duties that Jimmy had his first clash with Bince. He had been talking with Everett, the cashier, whom, in accordance with his [...] "method," [...] he was studying. From Everett he had learned that it was pay-day and he had asked the cashier to let him see the <b>pay-roll.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{say this}} filter's {{got to be}} replaced," [...] he told his chief of the water-works. [...] "We'll see about it. Let the people of Oakland drink mud for a change. It'll teach them to {{appreciate}} good water. Stop work at once. Get those men off the <b>pay-roll.</b> Cancel all orders for material. The contractors will sue? Let 'em sue and be damned. We'll be busted higher'n a kite or on easy street before they can get judgment." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jimmy had involuntarily {{acquired}} antipathy toward Bince {{at their}} first meeting, an antipathy which had been growing the more that he saw of the assistant general manager. This fact, coupled with Bince's present rather nasty manner, was rapidly arousing the anger of the efficiency expert. [...] "I didn't come in here," [...] he said, [...] "to discuss your matrimonial prospects, Mr. Bince. I came in here to see the <b>pay-roll,</b> and you will oblige me by letting me see it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am getting}} {{the best kind of}} {{cooperation}} from the men in the shop, practically without exception," [...] replied Jimmy, [...] "although there is one fellow, a straw boss named Krovac, who does not seem to take as kindly to the changes I have made as the others, but he really doesn't amount to anything as an obstacle." [...] Jimmy also thought of Bince and the <b>pay-roll,</b> but he was still afraid to broach the subject. Suddenly an inspiration came to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm the one {{who should}} be peeved," [...] spoke up the girl with a wry smile. [...] "Brazos was my pony. He's the one you picked out for me to ride while I am here; but I am sure poor Mr. Bridge feels as badly about it as anyone, and I know that he couldn't help it. We shouldn't be too hard on him. We {{might just as well}} attempt to hold him {{responsible}} for the looting of the bank and the loss of the <b>pay-roll</b> money." ...|$|E
6000|$|Thus {{the names}} of John Bascom and Charles Norwood {{were added to the}} <b>pay-roll</b> of the Diamond-Cross. The two left for the {{round-up}} camp immediately after dinner. Their directions were simple, but sufficient: [...] "Keep down the arroyo for fifteen miles till you get there." [...] Both being strangers from afar, young, spirited, and thus thrown together by chance for a long ride, {{it is likely that the}} comradeship that afterward existed so strongly between them began that afternoon as they meandered along the little valley of the Canada Verda.|$|E
60|$|Two years elapsed {{before the}} event transpired which proved a crisis in Billy's life. During this period his {{existence}} had been {{much the same as}} before. He had collected what was coming to him from careless and less muscular citizens. He had helped to stick up a half-dozen saloons. He had robbed the night men in two elevated stations, and for a while had been upon the <b>pay-roll</b> of a certain union and done strong arm work {{in all parts of the}} city for twenty-five dollars a week.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir," [...] {{said the}} Lizard. [...] "You see, {{it was like}} this: Murray there sent for me and tells me that he's got a job for me. He wants me to go and crack a safe at the International Machine Company's plant. He {{said there was a}} fellow on the inside helping him, that there wouldn't be any {{watchman}} there that night and that in the safe I was to crack was some books and papers that was to be destroyed, and on top of it was three or four thousand dollars in <b>pay-roll</b> money that I was to have as my pay for the job. Murray told me that the guy on the inside who wanted the job done had been working some kind of a <b>pay-roll</b> graft and he wanted the records destroyed, and he also {{wanted to get rid of}} the guy that was hep to what he had been doin'. All that I had to do with it was go and crack the safe and get the records, which I was to throw in the river, and keep the money for myself, but the frame-up on the other guy was to send him a phony message that would get him at the plant after I got through, and then notify the police so they could catch him there in the room with the cracked safe.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, you don't--that is, I {{really think}} you do, Mr. Fein, personally, but most bosses are so afraid of a big <b>pay-roll</b> that they {{deliberately}} discourage their people till they lose all initiative. I don't know; perhaps they're victims along with their employees. Just now I adore my work, and I do think that business can be made as glorious a profession as medicine, or exploring, or anything, but in most offices, it seems to me, the biggest ideal the clerks have is safety--a two-family house on a stupid street in Flatbush {{as a reward for}} being industrious. Doesn't matter whether they enjoy living there, if they're just secure. And you do know--Mr. Truax doesn't, but you do know--that the whole office system makes pale, timid, nervous people out of all the clerks--" ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{a quarter}} of an hour he {{returned}} with a bag on his broad shoulders, which one of his porters would have shrunk from lifting, and laid it before the blazing hearth of the now lighted kitchen. [...] "It's something the old woman got for her party, that didn't come off," [...] he said, apologetically. [...] "I reckon we can pick out enough for a spread. That darned Chinaman wouldn't come with me," [...] he added, with a laugh, [...] "because, he said, he'd knocked off work 'allee same, Mellican man!' Look here, Slinn," [...] he said, with a sudden decisiveness, [...] "my <b>pay-roll</b> of the men around here don't run short of a hundred and fifty dollars a day, and yet I couldn't get a hand to help me bring this truck over for my Christmas dinner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, dog-gone it, Miss Mason, you're right--in a way. I've built {{hundreds}} of houses up there, and I remember I was proud and {{glad to see}} them go up. I'm proud now, when I remember them. And there was Ophir--the most God-forsaken moose-pasture of a creek you ever laid eyes on. I made that into the big Ophir. Why, I ran the water in there from the Rinkabilly, eighty miles away. They all said I couldn't, but I did it, and I did it by myself. The dam and the flume cost me four million. But {{you should have seen}} that Ophir--power plants, electric lights, and {{hundreds of}} men on the <b>pay-roll,</b> working night and day. I guess I do get an inkling of what you mean by making a thing. I made Ophir, and by God, she was a sure hummer--I beg your pardon. I didn't mean to cuss.

"'I {{intended}} to stop here {{and give you}} {{the rest of the}} matter in another letter, but now, as I have a good chance to write, I think it is better to keep on, although this letter is already as long as the <b>pay-roll</b> of the navy. When I told Shirley about the gold, he made a bounce pretty nearly as big as the others, but this time I had him in a stout arm-chair, and he did no damage. He had in his pocket one of the gold bars he spoke of, and I had one of mine in my trunk, and when we put them together they were as like as two peas. What I told him dazed him at first, and he did not seem properly to understand what it all meant, but, after a little, a fair view of it came to him, and for hours we talked over the matter. Who the man was who had gone there after we left did not matter, for he could never come hack again.|$|E
60|$|This man of many {{projects}} had descended upon Mervo {{like a stone}} {{on the surface of}} some quiet pool, bubbling over with modern enterprise in general and, in particular, with a scheme. Before his arrival, Mervo had been an island of dreams and slow movement and putting things off till to-morrow. The only really energetic thing it had ever done in its whole history had been to expel his late highness, Prince Charles, and change itself into a republic. And even that had been done with the minimum of fuss. The Prince was away at the time. Indeed, he had been away for nearly three years, the pleasures of Paris, London and Vienna appealing to him more keenly than life among his subjects. Mervo, having thought the matter over during these years, decided that it had no further use for Prince Charles. Quite quietly, with none of that vulgar brawling which its neighbor, France, had found necessary in similar circumstances, it had struck his name off the <b>pay-roll,</b> and declared itself a republic. The royalist party, headed by General Poineau, had been distracted but impotent. The army, one hundred and fifteen strong, had gone solid for the new regime, and that had settled it. Mervo had then gone to sleep again. It was asleep when Mr. Scobell found it.|$|E

I tell you what, sir, the Catholic religion is not suited to a working civilization, or else the calendar ought to be overhauled {{and a lot of these}} saints put on the retired list. It's hard enough to have all the Apostles on your <b>pay-roll,</b> so to speak, but to have a lot of fellows run in on you as saints, and some of them not even men or women, but IDEAS, is piling up the agony!
