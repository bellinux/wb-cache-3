40|$|AbstractCondensationBoth Gonal-F and <b>Puregon,</b> {{especially}} in their high-dosage administration, might inhibit the endometrial cell proliferation {{in the initial}} 48 -hour culture. After 72 -hour culture, Gonal-F persisted the inhibition of the endometrial growth, whereas <b>Puregon</b> reversed its effect to enhance endometrial growth. ObjectivesEndometrial proliferation or regeneration during menstrual cycle is regulated by sexual hormones. However, the effect of gonadotropins on the endometrial cell growth remains obscure. Herein, we aimed to investigate the effects of recombinant follicle-stimulating hormones (r-FSHs) (Gonal-F and <b>Puregon)</b> on the proliferation of human endometrial cells in vitro. Materials and MethodsHuman endometrial cells (RL 95 - 2 cells) were obtained commercially and cultured in the serum-containing media {{in the presence of}} r-FSHs (Gonal-F and <b>Puregon</b> at concentrations of 0 mIU/mL, 200 mIU/mL, 400 mIU/mL, and 600 mIU/mL) up to 72 hours. According to the gonadotropin concentrations, all cultured endometrial cells were divided into four groups: (1) 0 mIU/mL (control); (2) 200 mIU/mL; (3) 400 mIU/mL; and (4) 600 mIU/mL. After 72 -hour culture, endometrial cell proliferations were assessed overnight by 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. The influences of different r-FSH agents and dosages on endometrial cell proliferation in each group were evaluated and compared. ResultsIn the four Gonal-F groups, the cell absorption (control and 200 mIU/mL, 400 mIU/mL, and 600 mIU/mL Gonal-F) after 24 / 48 / 72 -hour cultures were as follows: (1) 0. 57 / 0. 7 / 0. 82; (2) 0. 56 / 0. 66 / 0. 78; (3) 0. 55 / 0. 64 / 0. 77; and (4) 0. 51 / 0. 61 / 0. 78. After 48 hours, higher dosage of Gonal-F appeared to significantly inhibit the endometrial cell proliferation. After 72 -hour culture, all three dosages of Gonal-F appeared to inhibit the endometrial cell proliferation similarly. In <b>Puregon</b> groups, the cell absorptions were as follows: (1) 0. 62 / 0. 53 / 0. 62; (2) 0. 61 / 0. 5 / 0. 66; (3) 0. 61 / 0. 49 / 0. 66; and (4) 0. 64 / 0. 49 / 0. 66. <b>Puregon</b> administration displayed initial inhibition and subsequent stimulation effects on the endometrial cells. ConclusionsBoth Gonal-F and <b>Puregon,</b> {{especially in}} their high-dosage administration, appeared to inhibit the endometrial cell proliferation in the initial 48 -hour culture. After 72 -hour culture, Gonal-F persisted the inhibition of the endometrium, whereas <b>Puregon</b> reversed its effect by enhancing the endometrial growth.

40|$|OBJECTIVE The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess and compare the features of the Bemfola, Gonal-f and <b>Puregon</b> injection pens. METHODS Females who intended to undergo hormonal treatment received the three different pens in a randomized, consecutive sequence. For each of the pens, the potential patients completed an Injection Pen Assessment Questionnaire, as well as a questionnaire comparing the handling, convenience and preference among the three pens. RESULTS The mean score on the visual analogue scale (VAS) for the Bemfola pen (BP) was 77. 8 ± 14. 0; for the <b>Puregon</b> pen (PP), 72. 1 ± 12. 4; and for the Gonal-f pen (GP), 68. 6 ± 16. 4. The BP was superior to both competitor devices in pen size, inconspicuousness, ease of use and dose changing; no significant differences to both competitor pens were observed in the way the pen looks, the way the pen feels and the ease of injection of the volume. The 'overall' assessment was significantly better for the BP when compared to the GP (p = 0. 0019), while no significant difference was observed between the BP and the PP. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrated significantly higher ratings for pen size, inconspicuousness, ease of use and dose adjustment for the BP compared to other marketed pens...|$|E
40|$|Objective: {{to compare}} the safety and {{efficacy}} of recombinant FSH (follitropin beta, <b>Puregon,</b> NV Organon, OSS The Netherlands) and urinary FSH (urofollitropin, Metrodin; Ares-Seronon, Geneva, Switzerland). Design: A prospective, multicenter, assessor-blind, randomized, clinical trial. Setting: 12 European infertility clinics. Patients: 172 women (recombinant FSH: n= 105; urinary FSH: n= 67) with clomiphene citrate-resistant normogonadotropic chronic anovulation (WHO group II). Interventions: eligible subjects were randomized (ratio of recombinant to urinary FSH, 3 : 2) and treated for a maximum of three cycles. A low-dose step-up regimen was used, with 75 IU of FSH given IM daily for a maximum of 14 days and, if needed, weekly increments of half an ampule given thereafter until the threshold dose for follicular development was achieved. Main outcome measures: cumulative ovulation rate after three cycles, total FSH dose, and treatment period needed to achieve anovulation. Results: the cumulative ovulation rates after three treatment cycles were 95 % and 96 % for the recombinant and urinary FSH groups, respectively. Overall, ovulation was seen in 155 of 223 treatment cycles (69. 5 %) in the recombinant FSH group, compared with 92 of 138 treatment cycles (66. 7 %) in the urinary FSH group. In the first cycle, a statistically significantly lower total dose (750 versus 1, 035 UI)) and a shorter treatment period (10 vs 13 days) were needed in the recombinant FSH group to reach ovulation. Only one case of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome led to hospitalization. Two sets of twin (1 in each treatment group) and 1 set of triplets (in the recombinant FSH group) were born. Conclusions: recombinant FSH (<b>Puregon)</b> is more efficient than urinary FSH (Metrodin) in inducing follicular developmen...|$|E
40|$|Background: Intrauterine Insemination (IUI) {{remains the}} first thought of {{infertility}} treatment. Objective: To compare the stimulation effects and Pregnancy rate (PR) outcomes of two ovulation induction (OI) medications, human-derived menopausal gonadotrophins (hMGH), Merional (MER), and recombinant follicular stimulating hormone (rFSH), <b>Puregon</b> (PUR), in {{a cohort of}} Saudi infertile patients, for better predictability of treatment results. Materials and Methods: During a 24 -month period, 296 women underwent IUI single treatments. PR’s were correlated {{with the type of}} stimulation medication that were prospectively and randomly assigned to each patient, and with the number and size of maturing follicles detected on the hCG injection day. Results: MER and PUR needed comparable number of days (9. 26 ± 4. 74 and 9. 73 ± 6. 27 respectively) before follicles were ready for IUI, although the average amount used from MER, 1199. 90 IU, was about double that was used from PUR, 621. 08 IU. The overall PR in case of PUR however was nearly double that of MER, 13. 28...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies suggest}} that {{administration}} of follitropin-beta with a pen device (<b>Puregon</b> Pen(R)) is more convenient, less painful and 16 - 18 % more efficient. The {{aim of this study}} was to perform an economic evaluation of the administration of follitropin-beta by this pen device against follitropin-alpha by multidose and highly purified (HP) HMG by conventional syringe in IVF treatment by comparing the process utilities and the costs for the Dutch setting. Conjoint analysis assessed the process utilities for the three administration modes on a scale from 0 to 1. A decision analytic model estimated the costs of an average IVF cycle from a societal perspective. Patients estimated the process utility at 0. 96 for the pen, 0. 53 for the multidose and 0. 36 for the conventional syringe. Additional costs were estimated at 0 Euros and 194 Euros, comparing the pen with multidose or conventional methods respectively. Assuming a 16 % efficiency gain of the pen, costs ranged from Euros- 135 (savings) to 60 Euros (extra costs). In conclusion, patients perceive sufficient benefits to the pen device to choose it over other dosing methods. Dominance of the pen device over the multidose method was shown. Compared with the conventional administration method, the added value of the pen device was 2. 7 (0. 96 / 0. 36) times higher...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Follicle {{stimulating}} hormone (FSH) {{has been}} routinely used for ovulation induction. Because of rapid clearance of the hormone, FSH is commonly administered by daily intramuscular or subcutaneous injections in in-vitro fertilization (IVF). To {{reduce the number}} of visits to the clinic, an intermittent vaginal injection of rhFSH every 3 days employing the concepts of mesotherapy and uterine first-pass effect was invented and has successfully been applied in women receiving IVF treatment. This study was designed to monitor the pharmacokinetic pattern of rhFSH administered vaginally. Methods Twelve healthy women with regular ovulatory cycles were recruited. All volunteers received gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist to suppress pituitary function and were assigned to receive single dose recombinant human FSH (rhFSH, <b>Puregon</b> 300) either using conventional abdominal subcutaneous injection or vaginal subcutaneous injection in a randomized cross-over study. Serum samples were collected at pre- scheduled time intervals after injections of rhFSH to determine immunoreactive FSH levels. Pharmacokinetic parameters characterizing rate [maximal plasma concentrations (Cmax) and time of maximal plasma concentrations (tmax) ] and extent [area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and clearance] of absorption of rhFSH were compared. Results Vaginal injection of rhFSH was well tolerated and no drug-related adverse reaction was noted. Our analysis revealed that tmax was significantly earlier (mean 6. 67 versus 13. 33 hours) and Cmax was significantly higher (mean 17. 77 versus 13. 96 IU/L) in vaginal versus abdominal injections. The AUC 0 -∞ was 1640 versus 1134 IU·hour/L in vaginal and abdominal injections, respectively. Smaller plasma elimination rate constant (0. 011 versus 0. 016 hour- 1), longer mean residence time (106. 58 versus 70. 47 hours), and slower total body clearance (292. 2 versus 400. 1 mL/hour) were also found in vaginal injection. Conclusion The vaginal injection mode elicited a rapid and highly extended absorption of rhFSH injected compared to conventional abdominal injection. These data indicate that the rate and extent of FSH absorption from the injection site can vary depending on the route of the FSH administration. </p...|$|E
40|$|In a {{randomized}} multicenter study, the efficacies {{of two different}} GnRH agonists were {{compared with that of}} hCG for triggering final stages of oocyte maturation after ovarian hyperstimulation for in vitro fertilization. Ovarian stimulation was conducted by recombinant FSH (<b>Puregon),</b> and the GnRH antagonist ganirelix (Orgalutran) was coadministered for the prevention of a premature LH rise. Luteal support was provided by daily progestin administration. Frequent blood sampling was performed at midcycle in the first 47 eligible subjects included in the current study, who were randomized for a single dose of 0. 2 mg triptorelin (n = 17), 0. 5 mg leuprorelin (n = 15), or 10, 000 IU hCG (n = 15). Serum concentrations of LH, FSH, E 2, and progesterone (P) were assessed at variable intervals. LH peaked at 4 h after both triptorelin and leuprorelin administration, with median LH levels of 130 and 107 IU/liter (P < 0. 001), respectively. LH levels returned to baseline after 24 h. Subjects receiving hCG showed peak levels of 240 IU/liter hCG 24 h after administration. A rise in FSH to 19 IU/liter (P < 0. 001) was noted in both GnRH agonist groups 8 h after injection. Within 24 h the areas under the curve for LH and FSH were significantly higher (P < 0. 001) in both GnRH agonist groups compared with that for hCG. E 2 and P levels were similar for all groups up to the day of oocyte retrieval. Luteal phase areas under the curve for P and E 2 were significantly elevated (P < 0. 001) in the hCG group. The mean (+/-SD) numbers of oocytes retrieved were 9. 8 +/- 5. 4, 8. 7 +/- 4. 5, and 8. 3 +/- 3. 3; the percentages of metaphase II oocytes were 72 %, 85 %, and 86 %; and fertilization rates were 61 %, 62 %, and 56 % in the triptorelin, leuprorelin, and hCG group, respectively (P = NS for all three comparisons). These findings support the effective induction of final oocyte maturation in both GnRH agonist groups. In summary, after treatment with the GnRH antagonist ganirelix for the prevention of premature LH surges, triggering of final stages of oocyte maturation can be induced effectively by a single bolus injection of GnRH agonist, as demonstrated by the induced endogenous LH and FSH surge and the quality and fertilization rate of recovered oocytes. Moreover, corpus luteum formation is induced by GnRH agonists with luteal phase steroid levels closer to the physiological range compared with hCG. This more physiological approach for inducing oocyte maturation may represent a successful and safer alternative for in vitro fertilization patients undergoing ovarian hyperstimulation...|$|E
