Since the late 1940s, Methanol is also used as the primary fuel ingredient in the powerplants for radio control, control line, free flight airplanes, cars and trucks; such engines use a <b>platinum</b> <b>filament</b> glow plug that ignites the methanol vapor through a catalytic reaction. Drag racers, mud racers, and heavily modified tractor pullers also use methanol as the primary fuel source. Methanol is required with a supercharged engine in a Top Alcohol Dragster and, until the end of the 2006 season, all vehicles in the Indianapolis 500 had to run on methanol. As a fuel for mud racers, methanol mixed with gasoline and nitrous oxide produces more power than gasoline and nitrous oxide alone.|$|E

Sublimating this platinum at high temperatures leaves behind thin filaments of super-pure graphite.He thought that his discovery could be used in incandescent lights instead of carbonized bamboo filament.Helped by Naccari, he experimented with his invention in 1880 in the physics laboratory of the University of Turin.|$|R

We demonstrate the performance of microfluidic blood-filtrations chips, immune-diagnostic assays, and evaporative coolers. Furthermore, we show how micro-fabricated <b>platinum</b> <b>filaments</b> can be used for highly localized heating and temperature measurement.

25|$|Pyrolysis is {{the thermal}} {{decomposition}} of materials in an inert atmosphere or a vacuum. The sample {{is put into}} direct contact with a platinum wire, or placed in a quartz sample tube, and rapidly heated to 600–1000°C. Depending on the application even higher temperatures are used. Three different heating techniques are used in actual pyrolyzers: Isothermal furnace, inductive heating (Curie Point filament), and resistive heating using <b>platinum</b> <b>filaments.</b> Large molecules cleave at their weakest points and produce smaller, more volatile fragments. These fragments can be separated by gas chromatography. Pyrolysis GC chromatograms are typically complex because {{a wide range of}} different decomposition products is formed. The data can either be used as fingerprint to prove material identity or the GC/MS data is used to identify individual fragments to obtain structural information. To increase the volatility of polar fragments, various methylating reagents can be added to a sample before pyrolysis.|$|R

5000|$|Thermal {{conductivity}} gauges rely on {{the fact}} that the ability of a gas to conduct heat decreases with pressure. In this type of gauge, a wire filament is heated by running current through it. A [...] thermocouple or Resistance Temperature Detector (RTD) can then be used to measure the temperature of the filament. This temperature is dependent on the rate at which the filament loses heat to the surrounding gas, and therefore on the thermal conductivity. A common variant is the Pirani gauge which uses a single <b>platinum</b> <b>filament</b> as both the heated element and RTD.

40|$|In a {{previous}} paper we reported a technique for generating an intense hyperthermal beam of hydrogen atoms and metastable H 3 molecules. From the flight {{time of the}} H 3 species between the source and detector we estimated that its lifetime exceeds 40 µs and that it must therefore be in the 2 p 2 A [script `] 2 excited Rydberg state. In this paper we report experiments utilizing this novel source of H 3 molecules. Beam-gas attenuation measurements indicate that the H 3 –Ar cross section is roughly ten {{times larger than the}} H–Ar cross section for translational energies in the 1 to 10 eV range. This observation is consistent with the assignment of the H 3 to that excited state, which has a much larger effective radius than a ground state hydrogen atom. The temperature dependence of the surface ionization of H 3 by heated tungsten and <b>platinum</b> <b>filaments</b> is used to obtain effective ionizational potentials of this species. These potentials suggest that upon interaction with a metal surface, the metastable state decays to the repulsive 2 p 2 E[script '] state which then surface ionizes to produce H + 3. The production H + 3 and H+ when the H 3 beam is irradiated with UV light from a high pressure mercury lamp was also observed and is attributed to the relatively low ionization potential (~ 3. 7 eV) of the 2 p 2 A [script '][script '] 2 metastable state of H 3...|$|R
50|$|The {{glow plugs}} used in model engines are {{significantly}} different from those used in full-size diesel engines. In full-size engines, the glow plug is used only for starting. In model engines, the glow plug {{is an integral part}} of the ignition system because of the catalytic effect of the platinum wire. The glow plug is a durable, mostly <b>platinum,</b> helical wire <b>filament</b> recessed into the plug's tip. When an electric current runs through the plug, or when exposed to the heat of the combustion chamber, the filament glows, enabling it to help ignite the special fuel used by these engines. Power can be applied using a special connector attaching to the outside of the engine, and may use a rechargeable battery or DC power source.|$|R
50|$|When Edison began testing {{incandescent}} lamps {{he ran into}} a major problem. The problem was Edison wasn’t sure what material to use for the filament. Most of the material he tried would melt. There was too much oxygen and heat created by the electric current. As a result the filaments would always burn. He used two methods to correct this issue. At first Edison {{had to find a}} new material to use. He began by using <b>platinum</b> for his <b>filaments</b> with little success. Eventually he made his filaments by carbonizing Bristol board, which is a type of cardboard. He also acquired the best vacuum pumps available at the time. This would reduce the amount of oxygen inside of the bulbs. These two changes made it possible for Edison to create the light bulb we all use today.|$|R

He built a <b>platinum</b> <b>filament</b> incandescent light in 1859 (Conot, p120). At the age of 39 while living in Salem, Massachusetts, he lit the parlor of his home at 11 Pearl St with incandescent lamps, the first house {{in the world to}} be lit by electricity. He was a co-inventor of the self-exciting dynamo, an electric generator using electromagnets for the field which are energized by the generator output, in 1866 (Derry & Williams, p614). In 1868, with the Farmer dynamo, Farmer lit a house in Massachusetts. He also patented an early lightbulb (which was later bought by Thomas Edison).|$|E
5000|$|Glow fuel {{generally}} {{consists of}} methanol {{with varying degrees}} of nitromethane content as an oxidizer for greater power, generally between 5% and 30% of the total blend. These volatiles are suspended in a base oil of castor oil, synthetic oil or a blend of both for lubrication and heat control, again, in varying degrees of overall content. The lubrication system is a [...] "total loss" [...] type, meaning that the oil is expelled from the exhaust after circulating through the engine. The fuel ignites when it comes in contact with the heating element of the glow plug. Between strokes of the engine, the wire remains hot, continuing to glow partly due to thermal inertia, but largely due to the catalytic combustion reaction of methanol remaining on the <b>platinum</b> <b>filament.</b> This keeps the filament hot, allowing it to ignite the next charge, thus sustaining the power cycle.|$|E
50|$|Starr appears {{never to}} have {{demonstrated}} his electric lamp while in Cincinnati. In February 1845 he and a business associate, Edward Augustin King (d.1863), set out for England to secure British and French patents for the invention. King described construction and use of a lamp in September 1845, and British patent No. 10,919 was granted to King on November 4, 1845. The patent described two styles of lamp. In one, a <b>platinum</b> strip (or <b>filament)</b> was operated in a glass enclosure, but {{was not in a}} vacuum. In the second type, a carbon strip held between two clamps was enclosed in a vacuum in the space above a column of mercury, in an arrangement similar to a barometer. The mercury column was required because vacuum pumps of the time could not provide the high vacuum needed to operate a carbon emitter for a practical duration. The construction of Starr's carbon lamp allowed the strip to be replaced when it failed, making the lamp renewable.|$|R
50|$|Glow plugs {{are used}} for {{starting}} as well as continuing the power cycle. The glow plug consists of a durable, mostly platinum, helically wound wire filament, within a cylindrical pocket in the plug body, exposed to the combustion chamber. A small direct current voltage (around 1.5 volts) {{is applied to the}} glow plug, the engine is then started, and the voltage is removed. The burning of the fuel/air mixture in a glow-plug model engine, which requires methanol for the glow plug to work in the first place, and sometimes with the use of nitromethane for greater power output and steadier idle, occurs due to the catalytic reaction of the methanol vapor to the presence of the <b>platinum</b> in the <b>filament,</b> thus causing the ignition. This keeps the plug's filament glowing hot, and allows it to ignite the next charge. Since the ignition timing is not controlled electrically, as in a spark ignition engine or by fuel injection, as in an ordinary diesel, it must be adjusted by the richness of the mixture, the ratio of nitromethane to methanol, the compression ratio, the cooling of the cylinder head, the type of glow plug, etc. A richer mixture will tend to cool the filament and so retard ignition, slowing the engine, and a rich mixture also eases starting. After starting the engine can easily be leaned (by adjusting a needle valve in the spraybar) to obtain maximum power. Glowplug engines are also known as nitro engines. Nitro engines require a 1.5 volt ignitor to light the glow plug in the heat sink. Once primed, pulling the starter with the ignitor in will start the engine.|$|R

This method offers great potential to produce carbon nanotube arrays with simultaneous control over the nanotube orientation, position, density, diameter and even chirality.; Chapter 3 introduces the wafer-scale integration and assembly of aligned carbon nanotubes, including full-wafer scale synthesis and transfer of massively aligned carbon nanotube arrays, and nanotube device fabrication on 4 inch Si/SiO 2 wafer to yield submicron channel transistors with high on-current density ~ 20 μA/μm and good on/off ratio and CMOS integrated circuits. In addition, various chemical doping methods for n-type nanotube transistors are studied to fabricate CMOS integrated nanotube circuits such as inverter, NAND and NOR logic devices. Furthermore, defect-tolerant circuit design for NAND and NOR is proposed and demonstrated to guarantee the correct operation of logic circuit, regardless {{of the presence of}} mis-aligned or mis-positioned nanotubes.; Carbon nanotube flexible electronics and smart textiles for ubiquitous computing and sensing are demonstrated in chapter 4. A facile transfer printing technique has been introduced to transfer massively aligned single-walled carbon nanotubes from the original sapphire/quartz substrates to virtually any other substrates, including glass, silicon, polymer sheets, and even fabrics. The characterization of transferred nanotubes reveals that the transferred nanotubes are highly conductive, transparent, and flexible as well. Based on transferred nanotube arrays on fabric, we have successfully demonstrated nanotube transistors with on/off ratios ~ 105, and chemical sensors for low-concentration NO 2 and 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT).; In Chapter 5, I present the study of transparent conductive thin films made with two kinds of commercial carbon nanotubes: HiPCO and arc-discharge nanotubes. These films have been further exploited as hole-injection electrodes for organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) on both rigid glass and flexible substrates. Our experiments reveal that films based on arc discharge nanotubes are overwhelmingly better than HiPCO-nanotube-based films in all the critical aspects, including the surface roughness, sheet resistance, and transparency. The optimized films show a typical sheet resistance of ~ 160 Ω/□ at 87 % transparency and have been successfully used to make OLEDs with high stability and long lifetime; Lastly, I present the fast and scalable integration of nanowire chemical sensors with micromachined hotplates built on SiN membranes. These hotplates allowed nanowire chemical sensors to operate at elevated temperatures in order to enhance the sensitivity of chemical sensors to target gases. By applying different current through the <b>platinum</b> heating <b>filament,</b> we can easily vary the device temperature from room temperature to 350 °C.

5000|$|The {{earliest}} model engines for free-flight {{model aircraft}} flown {{before the end}} of World War II used a 3:1 mix of white gas and heavy viscosity motor oil for the two-stroke spark ignition engines used for the hobby at that time. By 1948, the new glow plug-ignition model engines began to take over the market, requiring the use of methanol fuel to react in a catalytic reaction with the coiled <b>platinum</b> <b>filament</b> in a glow plug for the engine to run, usually using a castor oil-based lubricant contained in the fuel mix at about a 4:1 ratio. The glow-ignition variety of model engine, because it no longer required an onboard battery, ignition coil, ignition points and capacitor that a spark ignition model engine required, saved valuable weight and allowed model aircraft to have better flight performance. In their traditionally popular two-stroke and increasingly popular four-stroke forms, currently produced single cylinder methanol-fueled glow engines are the usual choice for radio controlled aircraft for recreational use, for engine sizes that can range from 0.8 cm3 (0.049 cu.in.) to as large as 25 to 32 cm3 (1.5-2.0 cu.in) displacement, and significantly larger displacements for twin and multi-cylinder opposed-cylinder and radial configuration model aircraft engines, many of which are of four-stroke configuration. Most methanol-fueled model engines, especially those made outside North America, can easily be run on so-called FAI-specification methanol fuel. Such fuel mixtures can be required by the FAI for certain events in so-called FAI [...] "Class F" [...] international competition, that forbid the use of nitromethane as a glow engine fuel component. In contrast, firms in North America that make methanol-fueled model engines, or who are based outside that continent and have a major market in North America for such miniature powerplants, tend to produce engines that can and often do run best with a certain percentage of nitromethane in the fuel, which when used can be as little as 5% to 10% of volume, and can be as much as 25 to 30% of the total fuel volume.|$|E

40|$|Sensors used in explosimeters for the {{detection}} of explosive gases are generally catalytic. The most widespread are catalytic pellets. A metallic oxidation catalyst is heated to a sufficiently high temperature to oxidize the gas. The oxidation reaction increases the temperature of the catalyst which increases its electrical resistance, whose amplitude is proportional to the gas concentration. In the 1950 s we developed a sensor of this type for the mining industry. It was based on a <b>platinum</b> <b>filament</b> and destined to detect methane, responsible for mine explosions. The filament is distinguished from the catalytic pellets by its operating temperature: 1000 °C instead of 600 °C, which confers on it the advantage of being relatively insensitive to fouling and catalyst poisoning. The disadvantage, however, is rapid wear, preventing it from operating permanently. The measurement technique thus involves energizing the sensor just long enough to make the measurement and then turning it off {{for as long as the}} application permits. The first instruments of this time could run for 100, 000 measurements, or about 9 months at the rhythm of one measurement every 4 minutes. By improving the filament heating technique, the measurement capacity has been increased considerably: 10, 000, 000 measurements with the last methanemeter recently marketed, or a lifetime of 1. 5 years at the practically continuous measurement rhythm of once every 5 seconds. Endowed with these performance characteristics, the <b>platinum</b> <b>filament</b> sensor is today a reliable solution for explosimetry, in particular in environments polluted with certain catalyst poisons such as sulfur-containing products, which other catalytic sensors resist poorly...|$|E

A more rigid and convenient apparatus has been designed and used by the writer (Fig. 1). Pyrex glass used in both the filamentsupport and bulb reduces the possibility of cracking or breaking. The removable filament-support {{makes it possible to}} replace the filament in a few moments. By turning up the ends of the 30 mill tungsten leads sealed into the glass, one may wind on the platinuria or tungsten wire and thus rapidly replace the filament. Platinum wire (Brown and Sharpe gauge No. 30) across a 110 volt circuit gives satisfactory results. A resistance in series with the lamp regulated to let 2 to 6 amperes through the filament results in a rapid evolution of ketene. After 8 to 12 hours continuous use there is a carbonaceous deposit on the filament.

40|$|Abstract — Microheaters are devices {{capable of}} raising the {{temperature}} locally {{while the rest of}} the chip remains at the ambient temperature. The targeted temperature levels depend on the desired application but are generally as high as possible. For applications such as microreactors or gas sensing, at least a few hundred degrees should be reached, but a temperature over 800 °C is desirable. Available microheaters commonly use the hotplate geometry and a <b>platinum</b> <b>filament</b> as a heating element. These heaters are limited to temperatures of about 600 °C. Moreover, platinum is not very compatible with conventional CMOS processes. In this paper, we present a hotplate heater based on monocrystalline silicon that is suitable for reaching at least 800 °C. Furthermore, as silicon is the base material of IC processing technology, CMOS integration is made more straightforward. In order to achieve low power consumption (~ 100 mW) with sufficiently low voltage levels, the silicon is heavily doped, and the heater geometry is optimized. The total resistance of the rectangular-like structure is in order of 1 kΩ. Thermal insulation for lowering down power losses is achieved by releasing a silicon microbridge by backside KOH etching. The buried oxide of the applied silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers is used as a stop layer...|$|E

The critical {{use of an}} experimental instrument is necessary to provide reliable data. In this work, a commercial pyrolyzer (CDS Pyroprobe 2000) is characterized to obtain a correspondence between the nominal and the effective operating conditions. This {{is the basis for}} the modeling estimation of the effective thermal history of the sample during each experimental run. The experimental results obtained performing the devolatilization of coals, biomass and waste fuels using the pyrolyzer are compared with those obtained in a conventional thermogravimetric balance, to evaluate the effects of extremely different operating conditions. The amount of volatile released programming the most severe thermal conditions using the pyrolyzer (thus in conditions more similar to large-scale plants) differs significantly from that of thermogravimetric runs. Global kinetics are obtained fitting the experimental results and using the thermal history of the sample from the model results. They depend strongly on the conditions used for the devolatilization. Global kinetics obtained in the thermogravimetric balance runs (low heating rate) overestimate the rate of devolatilization in the pyrolyzer (high heating rate). (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} pivotal function {{of animals in}} modernist writing, particularly where modernist style confronts inherited moral codes. Classic accounts of modernism emphasize “impersonality” as the prime method for artists seeking cultural and ethical authority in the period after 1880. This project digs into what I argue is ultimately the more palatable capacity of literary beasts to animate a similar poetics of authority. Where doctrines of impersonality often resorted to figures of the inorganic in order to simultaneously disavow and indulge the expression of authorial intention, modernists such as Gerard Manley Hopkins, Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, Rudyard Kipling, and Marianne Moore instead avowed their didactic ambitions by appealing not to traditional expressive and explicit methods nor, on the other hand, to the complete evacuation of personality, but to the vitality and instinct of animals. More than any <b>platinum</b> <b>filament</b> (T. S. Eliot’s famous catalyst), animals offered modernists a vocabulary for the bodily and behavioral mechanisms by which individuals become ethical and historical subjects. In my chapters, I examine specific formal effects that require animal energy—from the modeling of queer poetic virtuosities upon animal instinct (as in Hopkins’ windhover, for example, or Moore’s slapstick critters) and the casting of fictional characters along evolutionary-typological lines (as in Woolf’s The Waves) to the anticolonial implementation, even, of a “bestial” prose style resistant to modernism’s self-authorization (exemplified by the indifferent creatures we find in Finnegans Wake). ...|$|E
