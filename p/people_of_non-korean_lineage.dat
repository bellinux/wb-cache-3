Based on participant observation and interviews done in Toronto and an international online survey, I use a language-ideological perspective to look at why and how people choose to learn (or not learn) a particular language. Specifically, I analyze how nationalist, functionalist and cosmopolitan language ideologies position learners in various ways and in turn, affect their sense of ethnic, cultural and other forms of identity. I show how these ideologies are interrelated and have different effects on how the identities <b>of</b> <b>non-Koreans</b> and ethnic Koreans are constructed based on their respective statuses as outgroup and ingroup members learning Korean.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore and {{describe}} the relationship between the social interaction competence <b>of</b> <b>non-Korean</b> direct-care staff members and Korean American older adults exhibiting behavioral symptoms of dementia (BSDs) who reside in an ethnically specific nursing home. A pilot study was completed to evaluate the feasibility, usability, content validity, and inter-rater reliability of two social interaction-coding schemas, a dementia competence coding schema and a culturally competent coding schema, developed by the principal investigator. In general, there was a negative trend between direct-care staff's dementia competence in social interaction and BSDs that interacted with their level of cultural competence in social interaction. These results suggest that both dementia competent and culturally competent social interactions influence BSDs, although there were morning and afternoon differences. The results provide a foundation that may lead to the development of culturally appropriate and supportive interventions for ethnic minority older adults, as a starting point to improve dementia care for ethnic minority nursing home residents. Implications and recommendations for further studies are presented...|$|R

5000|$|In recent years, {{the number}} of mixed marriages in Korea has {{increased}} substantially due {{to a number of}} factors, among them the high number of Koreans studying abroad or traveling and {{the number of}} men who, unable to find a Korean wife, are marrying foreign nationals. As the world becomes more interconnected with the development of the internet, dating network sites or social network sites provide a medium for couples to interact. International marriages now make up more than 9% of all marriages in Korea. The bulk of 'mixed' marriages are between Korean men and foreign women, but there are also many Korean women marrying men from other countries. Following the tradition of Korea, inter-race marriage was rare but more recently, there is increased number of inter-racial marriages. [...] The circumstances of the marriages tend to differ depending on the gender of the Korean spouse as well as their economic capacities.International marriages in Korea have tripled since 2003 with the number of foreign wives numbering about 125 000 in 2012 with an estimated 8% of Korean men, especially those in rural areas, marrying non-Koreans. In total, in 2012 there are 144 681 registered spouse of Korean national with 125 031 (74.8%) wives and 19 650 (25.2%) foreign husbands.

The nationality <b>of</b> <b>non-Korean</b> brides differ from Vietnam (34.3%), China (33.9%), Philippines (9.3%).
