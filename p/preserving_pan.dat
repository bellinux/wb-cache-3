The custom known as Les cônes d'la Saint Jean was {{observed}} {{as late as the}} 1970s - horns or conch shells were blown. Ringing the bachîn (a large brass <b>preserving</b> <b>pan)</b> at midsummer to frighten away evil spirits survived as a custom on some farms until the 1940s and has been revived as a folk performance in the 21st century.|$|E
40|$|Context: Video {{stabilization}} {{techniques have}} gained popularity for their permit to obtain {{high quality video}} footage even in non-optimal conditions. There have been significant works done on video stabilization by developing different algorithms. Most of the stabilization software displays the missing image areas in stabilized video. In {{the last few years}} hand-held video cameras have continued to grow in popularity, allowing everyone to easily produce personal video footage. Furthermore, with online video sharing resources being used by a rapidly increasing number of users, a large proportion of such video footage is shared with wide audiences. Sadly such videos often suffer from poor quality as frame vibration in video makes human perception not comfortable. In this research an attempt has been made to propose a robust video stabilization algorithm that stabilizes the videos effectively. Objectives: The main objective of our thesis work is to perform effective motion estimation using SIFT features to calculate the inter frame motion, allowing to find Global Motion Vectors and optimal motion compensation is to be achieved using adaptive fuzzy filter by removing the unwanted shakiness and <b>preserve</b> the <b>panning</b> leading to stabilized video. Methods: In this study three types of research questions are used- Experimentation and Literature review. To accomplish the goal of this thesis, experimentation is carried out for performing video stabilization. Motion estimation is done using feature based motion estimation using SIFT and GMVs are calculated. The intentional motion is filtered using Adaptive fuzzy filter to <b>preserve</b> <b>panning</b> and Motion compensation is performed to wrap the video to its stabilized position. MOS implies the mean scores of the subjective tests performed according to the recommendations of ITU-R BT. 500 - 13 and ITU-T P. 910 to analyze the results of our stabilized videos. Results: As a part of results from our work, we have successfully stabilized the videos of different resolutions from experimentation. Performance of our algorithm is found better using MOS. Conclusions: Video Stabilization can be achieved successfully by using SIFT features with pre conditions defined for feature matching and attempts are made to improve the video stabilization process...|$|R
40|$|A digital Video Stabilization (DVS) system {{removes the}} {{unwanted}} shaking in the videos acquired by hand-held cameras and <b>preserves</b> the <b>panning.</b> In this paper, a digital video stabilization system is proposed based upon adaptive cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC) filtering. A CMAC is {{a manifestation of}} the associative memory learning structure present in the cerebellum of human being. Adaptive CMAC filtering has favorable properties of small size, good generalization, rapid learning and dynamic response. Thus, it is more suitable for high-speed signal processing applications. The adaptive CMAC is used to adjust the coefficients of IIR filter employed in the proposed model. The training of CMAC is based upon fuzzy rule. The efficacy of the proposed adaptive CMAC filtering has been validated by evaluating it on a set of test video sequences...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the early developments of a recently started research project, aimed at studying from a multidisciplinary perspective an exceptionally well <b>preserved</b> ancient <b>pan</b> flute. A brief {{discussion of the}} history and iconography of pan flutes is provided, {{with a focus on}} Classical Greece. Then a set of non-invasive analyses are presented, which are based on 3 D scanning andmaterials chemistry, and are the starting point to inspect the geometry, construction, age and geographical origin of the instrument. Based on the available measurements, a preliminary analysis of the instrument tuning is provided, which is also informed with elements of theory of ancient Greek music. Finally, the paper presents current work aimed at realizing an interactive museum installation that recreates a virtual flute and allows intuitive access to all these research facets...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} ongoing work {{aimed at}} realizing an interactive museum installation that aids museum visitors learn about {{a musical instrument}} {{that is part of}} the exhibit: an exceptionally well <b>preserved</b> ancient <b>pan</b> flute, most probably of greek origins. The paper first discusses the approach to non-invasive analysis on the instrument, which was based on 3 D scanning using computerized tomography (CT scan), and provided the starting point to inspect the geometry and some aspects of the construction of the instrument. A tentative reconstruction of the instrument tuning is then presented, which is based on the previous analysis and on elements of theory of ancient Greek music. Finally, the paper presents the design approach and the first results regarding the interactive museum installation that recreates the virtual flute and allows intuitive access to several related research facets...|$|R
40|$|Gene {{duplication}} generates extra gene {{copies in}} which mutations can accumulate without risking {{the function of}} pre-existing genes. Such mutations modify duplicates and contribute to evolutionary novelties. However, {{the vast majority of}} duplicates appear to be short-lived and experience duplicate silencing within a few million years. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms leading to these alternative fates. Here we delineate differing molecular trajectories of a relatively recent duplication event between humans and chimpanzees by investigating molecular properties of a single duplicate: DNA sequences, gene expression and promoter activities. The inverted duplication of the Glutathione S-transferase Theta 2 (GSTT 2) gene had occurred at least 7 million years ago in the common ancestor of African great apes and is <b>preserved</b> in chimpanzees (<b>Pan</b> troglodytes), whereas a deletion polymorphism is prevalent in humans. The alternative fates are associated with expression divergence between these species, and reduced expression in humans is regulated by silencing mutations that have been propagated between duplicates by gene conversion. In contrast, selective constraint preserved duplicate divergence in chimpanzees. The difference in evolutionary processes left a unique DNA footprint in which dying duplicates are significantly more similar to each other (99. 4 %) than preserved ones. Such molecular trajectories could provide insights for the mechanisms underlying duplicate life and death in extant genomes...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} recent {{motivation}} {{to search for}} neuroanatomical asymmetries in nonhuman primates {{in order to provide}} comparative information on how the human brain is structurally organized to support specific cognitive capabilities, such as language functions. We took the opportunity to study Broca's area homologue in a novel sample of 80 <b>preserved</b> postmortem chimpanzee (<b>Pan</b> troglodytes) cerebral hemispheres. Consistent with the only prior study documenting the morphology of Broca's area homologue in the chimpanzee (Sherwood et al. [2003] Anat Rec 271 : 276 - 285), we report great interindividual variation in the structure and connections of the sulci investigated, most notably a left-sided bias in the bifurcation of the inferior precentral sulcus, an anatomical feature that occurs much more frequently in chimpanzees relative to humans. Consistent with our recent neuroimaging report (Keller et al. [2009 b] J Neurosci 29 : 14607 - 14616), no population-based interhemispheric asymmetries of sulcal length existed that could be considered markers of the size of Broca's area homologue. With strict anatomical guidelines, we report that the diagonal sulcus was present in 25 % left and 20 % right chimpanzee hemispheres studied, which is substantially less that the general prevalence in humans. Through the presentation of schematic drawings, photographs, morphological recordings and sulcal length metrics, our data illustrate the interindividual variability of Broca's area homologue in the chimpanzee and support the notion of no macroscopic asymmetry of this important homologous language brain region in one of the closest evolutionary ancestor to modern humans. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|The {{production}} of activated carbons (ACs) involves two main steps: the carbonization of the carbonaceous {{of raw materials}} at temperatures below 1073 K {{in the absence of}} oxygen and the activation had realized at the temperature up to 1173 but the most useful temperature at 1073 K. In our study we used the most common industrial and consumer solid waste, namely PET, alone or blended with other synthetic polymer PAN. By mixing the two polymers in different ratios, an improvement of the yield of the AC production was found and some textural properties were enhanced by comparison with the AC prepared using each polymer separately. When all the samples were exposed through the carbonization process with a pyrolysis the mixture of PAN-PET (1 : 1 w/w) yield around 31. 9 %, between that obtained with PET (16. 9 %) or PAN (42. 6 %) separately. The combine activation, with CO 2 at 1073 K, allow ACs with a lower burn-off degree isothermally, when compared with those attained with PET or PAN alone, but with similarly chemicals or textural properties. The resultant ACs are microporous in their nature, as the activation time increase, the PET-PAN mixture AC are characterized by a better developed porous structure, when associated with the AC prepared from PAN. The AC prepared from PET-PAN mixture are characterized by basic surface characteristics, with a pHpzc around 10. 5, which is an important characteristic for future applications on acidic pollutants removals from liquid or gaseous phase. In this study we had used the FTIR methods to determine the main functional groups in the surface of the activated carbons. The adsorbents prepared from PAN fibres presents an IR spectrum with similar characteristics to those obtained with PET wastes, but with fewer peaks and bands with less intensity, in particular for the PAN- 8240 sample. This can be reflected by the stretching and deformation modes of NH bond in the range 3100 – 3300 cm- 1 and 1520 – 1650 cm- 1, respectively. Also, stretching mode associated to C–N, C=N, can contributed to the profile of IR spectrum around 1170 cm- 1, 1585 – 1770 cm- 1. And the TGA methods was used to study the loses of the precursors mass according to the excessive of the temperature. The results showed that, there were different decreasing of the mass of each precursors. PAN degradation started at almost 573 K and at 1073 K, <b>PAN</b> <b>preserve</b> more than 40 % of the initial mass. PET degradation started at 650 K, but at 1073 K, it has lost 80 % of the initial mass. However, the mixture of PET-PAN (1 : 1 w/w) showed a thermogravimetric profile between the two polymers tested individually, with a final mass slightly less than 30 %. From a chemical point of view, the carbonisation of PET mainly occurs in one step between 650 and 775 K...|$|R
