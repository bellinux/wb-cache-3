5000|$|Gideon <b>Planish</b> is a 1943 {{novel by}} American writer Sinclair Lewis. The novel {{tells the story}} of Gideon <b>Planish,</b> an unprincipled social climber who becomes {{involved}} in various shady philanthropic organizations in his quest for stature without accountability. The work did not fare as well with critics as some of Lewis' earlier social novels, and is considered one of his minor works.|$|E
50|$|Elmer Gantry {{also appears}} as a minor {{character}} in two later, lesser-known Lewis novels: The Man Who Knew Coolidge and Gideon <b>Planish.</b>|$|E
50|$|Gideon <b>Planish</b> is {{considered}} a minor work and it was obvious Lewis was rehashing many of his old ideas as many themes and points ring familiar with the target being the shady industry of less-than-legitimate fundraising organizations. While the main character was without moral boundaries, he did remain loyal to his wife (a rare quality in Lewis' characters) but he never achieved anything genuine or of substance as he attempted to achieve everything which focused on style and perception. An earlier character of Lewis', Elmer Gantry, crosses paths with <b>Planish</b> {{several times in the}} book but their interactions serve only as a method to emphasize to the reader the similarities between the crooks in organized religion and the crooks in general philanthropy.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Planishing</b> (from the Latin planus, [...] "flat") is a {{metalworking}} {{technique that}} involves finishing the surface by finely shaping and smoothing sheet metal. This {{is done by}} hammering with a <b>planishing</b> panel hammer or slapper file against a shaped surface called a <b>planishing</b> stake that is held in a vice or a mounting hole in a blacksmith's beak anvil, or against hand-held, shaped, metal tools that are known as Dollies or Anvils. The shape of the stake or dolly has to match the desired work piece contour, and so they {{come in a variety}} of complex shapes. Alternatively, <b>planishing</b> may be done by the use of an English Wheel. After approximately forming a metal object, by stretching with techniques such as sinking and raising, and then shaping and smoothing an object, metal workers use <b>planishing</b> for surface finishing. <b>Planishing</b> is a hand-driven process used in auto body repair and sheet metal craft work such as medieval armour production.|$|R
50|$|Since <b>planishing</b> hammers are {{generally}} {{in contact with}} the outside surface of the piece, they are flat, have rounded edges and are polished to avoid marring the work. Pneumatic (air powered) <b>planishing</b> hammers strike hundreds of blows per minute.|$|R
50|$|Lewis {{followed}} up this first great success with Babbitt (1922), {{a novel that}} satirized the American commercial culture and boosterism. The story was set in the fictional Midwestern town of Zenith, Winnemac, a setting to which Lewis returned in future novels, including Gideon <b>Planish</b> and Dodsworth.|$|E
50|$|Winnemac is {{a fictional}} U.S.state invented by the writer Sinclair Lewis. His novel Babbitt {{takes place in}} Zenith, its largest city (population 361,000, {{according}} to a sketch-map Lewis made to guide his writing.). Winnemac is also a setting for Gideon <b>Planish,</b> Arrowsmith, Elmer Gantry, and Dodsworth.|$|E
5000|$|Gideon <b>Planish</b> (1943) {{takes aim}} at less-than-honorable {{fundraising}} organizations. In {{a similar manner}} of his other works, the reader follows the self-titled character through his life and numerous (but slightly related) professions dealing with professional [...] "organizationality" [...] which is {{better known as the}} for-profit industry of pompous fundraising run by shady [...] "philanthropists" [...] running a wide variety of guilds, committees, foundations, leagues and councils for selfish and greedy purposes.|$|E
50|$|Various hammers and dollies {{used for}} <b>planishing.</b>|$|R
50|$|An English {{wheel is}} a better tool for a skilled {{craftsman}} for low-crown applications than manually hammering. <b>Planishing</b> manually using dollies and slapper files or <b>planishing</b> hammer, after hammer forming is very labour-intensive. Using a pear shaped mallet and sandbag to stretch the sheet metal (sinking), or by raising on a stake, speeds up the fabrication of higher crown sections. A pneumatic hammer or power hammer is faster still. The English wheel is very effective when used for <b>planishing,</b> (for which it was originally patented in England), to a smooth final finish after these processes.|$|R
50|$|Care must {{be taken}} not to allow sheet metal to work harden and become brittle during <b>planishing.</b> If it does, it must be annealed.|$|R
50|$|After {{achieving}} the correct basic shape {{with the correct}} amount of metal in the right places, the worker must blend the edges of high crown areas with low crown areas, so that the surface contour transitions {{from one to the}} other smoothly. After this, the final wheeling stage involves very light pressure wheeling to <b>planish</b> the surface to make it a smooth, cohesive shape. This stage does not stretch the metal but moves the already stretched metal around, so using the minimum anvil pressure and as wide an anvil as is possible with the panel shape, is essential.|$|E
50|$|Both {{metal and}} wood slappers {{are used for}} metalworking. Generally wood slappers are covered with a leather-face. Slappers {{can be used to}} shrink, contour, and <b>planish</b> (smooth) the panel without leaving rough marks to clean up. The slapper {{controls}} more surface with each blow than a hammer can and is very easy to use because it has the same angle of attack as a body hammer. This means the user does not need to change their arm and hand position when moving from hammer to slapper. The slapper can be far more effective than the hammer for shrinking because its leverage gives greater mechanical advantage over the rough spots. The slapper is great for working metal over a T-stake or for gouging and planishing. A good slapper can make radius bends and crowns quite well. A slapper works well with forming stakes and post dollies for lightly planishing and pulling cold shrinks.|$|E
40|$|Keywords:extrusion hot embossing,roll-to-roll embossing, polymer microlens Abstract:In this paper,we {{analysed}} {{the problems}} {{that existed in the}} extrusion hot embossing process. To slove these problems,we designed a new extrusion hot embossing process and verified the effectiveness and feasibility of this process through experiments. The thickness and temperature of the extruded polymer film were affected by various factors. It is very difficult to ensure the uniformity of thickness and temperature before the polymer film enters into the hot embossing machine. Therefore,we add a <b>planish</b> unit and a temperature control unit to ensure the uniformity of thickness and temperature of the polymer film. At the same time,we produce the polymer film with microstructure on its surface by this two differern process sepatately and make some tests. The results show that:the new process greatly improved the uniformity of the thickness and temperature compared with the original embossing process. In this new process the uniformity of the thickness and temperature was better ensured...|$|E

50|$|First {{found in}} prehistoric bronze, in medieval times, shield bosses {{were made by}} armourers out of sheets of iron or steel. The armourer started with a flat, {{relatively}} thin sheet and sank the metal into a bowl, which might then be <b>planished</b> and polished.|$|R

50|$|The cup was {{designed}} in 1897 by the jeweller Robert Linzeler and {{was made by}} Bratiau in 1898. It is made of <b>planished</b> solid silver and weighs 10 kilos. The lot is 58 centimetres wide (81 with the handles) and 57 centimetres high. Placed on an ebony plinth, it is considered as a masterpiece of Art nouveau style.|$|R
5000|$|Key to {{producing}} the right shape {{is to have}} the right amount of stretched metal surface over this wider area. If this is achieved, it is possible to [...] "move" [...] the metal with minimal extra stretching, filling the low spots with metal from the high spots. This smoothing is almost like <b>planishing</b> using a moderate pressure setting, but is still heavier than that used for <b>planishing.</b> It is a time consuming and fiddly iterative process, {{that is one of the}} most difficult and skillful parts of wheeling. As the size of the panel/section increases, the work involved and the level of difficulty increases disproportionately. This is also a reason that very large panels can be very difficult to do and are made in sections. High crown panels/sections may need to be annealed due to work-hardening of the metal, which makes it brittle unworkable and liable to fracture.|$|R
50|$|One {{common use}} of this peening (stretching) process {{can be seen in}} the auto repair and auto custom {{fabrication}} industries where manual or machine assisted peening is used to stretch thin sheet metal to create curved surfaces. The manual method uses a hand held peening hammer and is a form of <b>planishing.</b> There are also machine assisted methods that use a version of a power hammer to peen the sheet metal.|$|R
2500|$|Hammers are essential. <b>Planishing,</b> chasing, {{creasing}} {{and setting}} down hammers {{are among the}} most common, as well as ball pein hammers. Horn or wooden mallets are also used. Before electric soldering irons became available, tinsmiths would use heated [...] "copper" [...] irons made of a wooden handle, iron shank and copper tips formed into different shapes. These items were heated in small furnaces, covered in sal ammoniac, and then used for soldering seams.|$|R
50|$|In the USA and Canada, {{the same}} job is done by an auto body mechanic. They do this using many skills such as <b>planishing</b> as well as various other {{metalworking}} techniques, welding, use of putty fillers, and many more. Accident repair may require the panel beater to either repair or replace various parts of a vehicle. These parts may be made from various metals including various steels and alloys, many different plastics, fibreglass and others.|$|R

40|$|A {{weld filler}} wire {{chemistry}} {{has been developed}} for fusion welding 2195 aluminum-lithium. The weld filler wire chemistry is an aluminum-copper based alloy containing high additions of titanium and zirconium. The additions of titanium and zirconium reduce the crack susceptibility of aluminum alloy welds while producing good weld mechanical properties. The addition of silver further improves the weld properties of the weld filler wire. The reduced weld crack susceptibility enhances the repair weldability, including when <b>planishing</b> is required...|$|R
50|$|Common tools {{used for}} <b>planishing</b> include panel beating hammers, slappers, and neck hammers. Heavy rawhide or {{hardwood}} hammers are often used. It {{is more difficult}} to make mistakes with heavy rawhide or wood mallets, but they are less effective for large imperfections. A worker, using repeated, relatively soft glancing blows, smooths the metal toward the curvature of the stake. If the metal begins to look dimpled, the worker is using too much force in individual hammer blows.|$|R
50|$|These {{locomotives}} were to {{form the}} basis for further development of the Pacific type, which was to become the standard express passenger steam locomotive type in South Africa. They were handsome locomotives and their appearance was enhanced by the use of <b>planished</b> steel plates to cover the boiler and cylinder lagging. They were equipped with two whistles of different tones and a steam turbine generator, mounted on the smokebox between the headlight and the chimney, to power the Edwards headlight.|$|R

5000|$|Mallets {{used for}} {{metalworking}} usually have either wood or plastic faces. These [...] "faces" [...] {{come in a}} variety of shapes, such as flat, torpedo, hemispheric, or square in shape. The different faces (and material the mallet is made of) allow you to work and/or shrink different metals. For instance, the flat face can be used for <b>planishing</b> and smoothing and for hand shrinking thicker soft metals. Whereas a large hickory [...] "torpedo mallet's" [...] striking weight makes it best suitable for shaping soft metals such as aluminum or copper, but a similar torpedo mallet made from heavy black rubber has a striking weight which is best used for shaping steel.|$|R
2500|$|Copper {{provides}} the highest thermal conductivity among non-noble metals {{and is therefore}} fast heating with unparalleled heat distribution (see: Copper in heat exchangers). Pots and pans are formed from copper sheets of various thicknesses, with those in excess of 2.5 mm considered commercial (or extra-fort) grade. Between 1mm and 2.5 mm wall thickness is considered utility (fort) grade, with thicknesses below 1.5 mm often requiring tube beading or edge rolling to reinforce structural rigidity in circular configurations. Less than 1mm wall thickness is generally considered decorative, with exception made for the case of [...]75 - 1mm <b>planished</b> copper, which is work-hardened by hammering and therefore expresses performance and strength characteristic of thicker material.|$|R
50|$|The engines from Beyer, Peacock were war-time {{austerity}} {{models on}} which <b>planished</b> steel boiler lagging {{was replaced by}} ordinary steel lagging, while cosmetic dressing items like stainless steel lagging bands, chrome-plated handrails and rounded corners {{on the front of}} the firebox lagging were absent or replaced by unplated items. While the boiler barrels of the pre-war engines were of nickel steel, the austerity locomotives had boiler barrels made of carbon steel with steel plates of 1/16 in greater thickness. When it was subsequently found that the increased thickness was unnecessary, 13/16 in thick carbon steel plates were used on later orders, the same thickness as earlier used with nickel steel plates, which resulted in a desirable reduction in axle loads.|$|R
