Since 1992, the CAP has moved most of its policy towards direct payments (DPs) that have been decoupled from production under the Mid-Term Review (MTR) in 2003. The shift towards decoupled payments highlights the asymmetry of the support among farmers and countries and the need such a <b>payment</b> to be <b>connected</b> <b>with</b> specific commitments towards European citizens.

This is in contrast to recent research; which has shown that domestically a zero intraday interest rate will achieve a social optimum and that the central bank has an incentive to achieve it.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to analyze whether the National Payment Gateway (NPG) is able to create efficiency in payment system, the design of NPG that is suitable for banking in Indonesia, the strategies needed for the implementation of the NPG and to analyze the organizer of NPG. Nowadays, the provider of retail and micro payment system such as payment based cards and payments using electronic money are not efficient yet. This is interesting because the development and the infrastructure of payment system are established separately by the industry without interoperability aspect. It may cause a high investment cost that must be spent by each provider payment system; the high cost that must be paid by the service user payment system and inefficiency in the national payment system. Based on the results of this research, the NPG on retail payment systems can increase efficiency of payment system both bank and non bank financial institutions. The NPG design that is suitable for banking in Indonesia must be a large-scale of <b>payment</b> system, <b>connected</b> <b>with</b> the ATM network, has a high speed in the process of transaction and secure, generate a flexible real time reports, have a basic standard and used for national benefit. The organizer that is suitable for NPG implementation is Government / Bank Indonesia, but become a national operator switching is not the scope of the task of Bank Indonesia in the payment system. So there are several options in determining which party will be implementing NPG. The options are private sector or the private sector and the Bank Indonesia although each option is still has pro and contra.
