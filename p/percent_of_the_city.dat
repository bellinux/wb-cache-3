5|$|Despite new investment, poverty {{remains an}} entrenched problem {{as it does}} in most post-industrial New England cities. Approximately 27.9 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> {{population}} is living below the poverty line. Recent increases in real estate values further exacerbate problems for those at marginal income levels, as Providence had the highest rise in median housing price of any city in the United States from 2004 to 2005.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the nature}} of the coins (e.g. {{providing}} kings' names), they have proved essential in constructing a chronology of the Kings of Aksum. An estimated 98 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> of Aksum remains unexcavated, and other areas even more so. Through analysis of the number of coins produced and the style of coins, archaeologists have been able to construct a rough chronology, generally agreed upon until the late 6th- and 7th-century kings. Of the 20 Aksumite Kings attested by their coins, inscriptions corroborate the existence of only two, who happen to be the most famous kings: Ezana and Kaleb, both of whose reigns were periods of exceptional prosperity during the height of the Aksumite kingdom.|$|E

25|$|After {{the fall}} of Najibullah's Democratic Republic of Afghanistan in April 1992, leaders of the {{different}} mujahideen factions were unable to form a government. Despite the 1992 Peshawar Accords, fighting started as Hekmatyar's party refused to sign the accords and started shelling the city for power. This marked {{the start of a}} dark period of the city, in which over 50,000 civilians were killed. About 80 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> was devastated and destroyed by 1996. A The New York Times analyst said in 1996 that the city was more devastated than Sarajevo, which was similarly destroyed during the Bosnian War in those years.|$|E
25|$|The mainshock {{took place}} on the third day of the Muslim {{observance}} of Ramadan, immediately collapsing many hotels, apartments, markets, and office buildings. Underground water mains broke and sewer systems crumbled. The Kasbah, a dilapidated fortress which had stood for centuries, crumbled {{on the side of a}} hill. With no water pressure and most fire stations having collapsed (killing their occupants) many fires were left burning in the resort city of Agadir with few firefighters and resources to fight them. With nearly seventy <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> in ruins, no rescue operations were able to be initiated or arranged from within Agadir.

25|$|On December 22, Iraqi forces {{advanced}} {{into the}} center of the city of Ramadi, and headed towards the main government complex. The attack was launched from al-Tamim and al-Humaira Districts in the southwest and south, northwards on 3 axes into the central al-Hoz District, and the Andalus and al-Malab Districts further east. On December 27, the Iraqi Army captured the government complex, after which they declared victory in Ramadi, and claimed to be in full control of the city center. However, on the following day, it was confirmed ISIL was still in control of 30 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> On December 30, 2015, the Iraqi Prime Minister visited Ramadi and raised the Iraqi flag at the government complex. ISIL casualties during the battle were reportedly high, while Iraqi Army casualties were low.|$|E
25|$|Sewer {{service is}} {{available}} to 87.7 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city,</b> and 100 {{percent of the population}} is serviced by treated water. While in most Brazilian cities the water is supplied by large state companies, in Porto Alegre the Municipal Department of Water and Sanitation Services, (DMAE) is the provider. It is the largest municipal water supplier in the country and enjoys operational autonomy and financial independence. As a separate entity from the municipal government it can make its own decisions on how to invest revenues it has collected, and such decisions are not directly subject to interference from the municipality. It receives no subsidies and makes no payments to the municipality itself. As a municipal undertaking, DMAE enjoys tax-exempt status, which allows it to keep water prices lower.|$|E
25|$|The city's {{history is}} marked by {{numerous}} great fires. In 1198, the Bagler-faction {{set fire to the}} city in connection with a battle against the Birkebeiner faction during the civil war. In 1248, Holmen and Sverresborg burned, and 11 churches were destroyed. In 1413 another fire struck the city, and 14 churches were destroyed. In 1428 the city was plundered by German pirates, and in 1455, Hanseatic merchants were responsible for burning down Munkeliv Abbey. In 1476, Bryggen burned down in a fire started by a drunk trader. In 1582, another fire hit the city centre and Strandsiden. In 1675, 105 buildings burned down in Øvregaten. In 1686 a new great fire hit Strandsiden, destroying 231 city blocks and 218 boathouses. The greatest fire to date happened in 1702 when 90 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> was burned to ashes. In 1751, there was a great fire at Vågsbunnen. In 1756, a new fire at Strandsiden burned down 1,500 buildings, and further great fires hit Strandsiden in 1771 and 1901. In 1916, 300 buildings burned down in the city centre, and in 1955 parts of Bryggen burned down.|$|E
5|$|Americans with origins {{from the}} Pacific are the {{smallest}} minority in Texas. According to the survey, only 18,000 Texans are Pacific Islanders; 16,400 are of non-Hispanic descent.

25|$|Reports of the quake's {{intensity}} in Christchurch generally ranged from IV to VIII (moderate to severe) on the modified Mercalli scale. A strong smell of sulphur was widely reported in Christchurch following the earthquake. Sewers were damaged, and water lines were broken. The water supply at Rolleston, located {{to the southwest}} of Christchurch, was contaminated. Power to up to 75 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> was disrupted. Christchurch Hospital was forced to use emergency generators {{in the immediate aftermath}} of the quake. About 90% of the electricity in Christchurch had been restored by 6:00pm the day of the earthquake. The repair of electricity was estimated to be more difficult in the rural areas. One building caught fire after its electricity was turned back on, igniting leaking LPG in the building. The fire was quickly extinguished by the Fire Service before it could spread. Damage to buried pipes may have allowed sewage to contaminate the residential water supply. Residents were warned to boil tap water before using it for brushing teeth, drinking, and washing or cooking food. Several cases of gastroenteritis were reported. By 7 September 28 cases had been observed at the city's welfare centres. The boil water notice for Christchurch and Banks Peninsula was lifted late on 8 September 2010, after more than 500 tests conducted over three days found no contamination.|$|E
500|$|In 1961, the New London Redevelopment Agency {{called for}} the station to be {{demolished}} {{to make room for}} a shopping mall or department store as an [...] "urban renewal" [...] project. This began a fifteen-year fight over the station building, pitting the Redevelopment Agency against a small group of private citizens who wished to have the building restored for further use. The city paid $120,000 to buy the station; demolition costs were estimated at $55,000. The New Haven Railroad folded into Penn Central in 1969; continually beset with financial problems, Penn Central had no interest in investing in the station. The station by this time was [...] "a dust-covered derelict with urine-soaked floors and peeling ceilings." [...] Amtrak took over intercity passenger service on May 1, 1971; Penn Central continued to operate a limited amount of local service that was discontinued over the rest of the decade. After a local effort, Union Station was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in June 1971 over the lobbying efforts of former mayor Richard Martin. Martin claimed that ninety <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> agreed with the redevelopment plans. Under the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, the addition to the NRHP prevented local authorities from using federal funds for demolition, although the law did not provide for enforcement or punishment.|$|E
500|$|Data {{shows that}} most crimes {{reported}} in the city tend to be focused around the downtown city center and its environs. Half of all property crimes are localized in about 6.5 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> An individual in Spokane has a one in fourteen chance of becoming a victim of burglary, larceny, motor vehicle theft, or arson. Spokane had the fourth highest rate of auto theft in the U.S. in 2010 and 2011 according to the National Insurance Crime Bureau. Drive-by shootings and drug use, particularly crack cocaine use, became worse in the early 1990s, and four drive-by shootings were recorded in December 1993 alone. In the 1990s, a special gang unit within the Spokane Police Department was established, with an officer [...] "collecting intelligence on gang activity and disseminating it to street officers". The 1990s also saw Spokane's most prolific serial killer, Robert Lee Yates, who killed thirteen prostitutes in Spokane's East Sprague red light district and confessed to two others in Tacoma, Washington. The transition of the Spokane Police Department to a community-policing precinct model {{has been successful in}} curbing crime rates since its introduction downtown, and has been expanded citywide. The crime woes are possibly due in part to an imbalance that Spokane County prisons receive of pre-release and work-release prisoners; An investigation by the Tacoma News Tribune found that while Spokane County accounts for 6.21 percent of the inmates in state prisons, it receives a disproportionate 16.73 percent of the inmate population to be released into the general population.|$|E
5000|$|In June 2001, {{employees}} at the Oasis had to reapply for their jobs at the resort when it was sold to Randy Black Sr. for $31 million, despite monopoly concerns; the Black family already owned two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city's</b> four casinos, and the Oasis gave them 91 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city's</b> casino hotel rooms, 85 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city's</b> table games, and 80 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city's</b> slot machines. Employees alleged that Black had lied to them and was planning to demote veteran employees and cut their salaries. Black claimed that he rehired 800 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Oasis' 900 employees, and that any salary cuts would be caused by Mesquite market conditions. At the time, Redd said about the purchase, [...] "I had lost touch with who I was -- my thing was tinkering with machines. I was never really a casino owner.
