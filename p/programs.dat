40|$|Abstract:- <b>Program</b> slicing is {{the task}} of finding all {{statements}} in a <b>program</b> that directly, or indirectly, influence {{the value of a}} variable occurrence. The set of statements that can affect the value of a variable at some point in a <b>program</b> is called a <b>program</b> backward slice. In several software engineering applications, such as <b>program</b> debugging and measuring the <b>program</b> cohesion and parallelism, several slices are computed at different <b>program</b> points. The existing algorithms for computing <b>program</b> slices are introduced to compute a slice at a <b>program</b> point. In these algorithms, the <b>program,</b> or the model that represents the <b>program,</b> is traversed completely or partially once. To compute more than one slice, the same algorithm is applied for every point of interest in the <b>program.</b> Thus, the same <b>program,</b> or <b>program</b> representation, is traversed several times. In this paper, an algorithm is introduced to compute all static slices of a computer <b>program</b> by traversing the <b>program</b> representation graph once. Therefore, the introduced algorithm is useful for software engineering applications that require computing <b>program</b> slices at different points of a <b>program.</b> The <b>program</b> representation graph used in this paper is called <b>Program</b> Dependence Graph (PDG). Key-Words:- <b>Program</b> slicing, static slicing, backward slicing, <b>program</b> dependence graph. ...|$|R
