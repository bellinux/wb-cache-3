40|$|Faculty of Engineering and the Built Environment; Master of Science in Engineering; Research ReportThe primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a methodology for evaluating how the reliability profile of the typical South African Platinum concentrator plant is affected by firstly the size of the primary milling units incorporated in the circuit and secondly by the way that the primary milling units are configured. A methodology, together with a set of general expressions is presented which considers the Platinum concentrator as a stochastic process where the behaviour of the <b>primary</b> <b>mill</b> is a direct measure of the failure pattern of the overall concentrator. The reliability, availability and maintainability (RAM) of the <b>primary</b> <b>mill,</b> and hence the overall concentrator, is then determined by a combination of three different Markov models where each Markov model is used to evaluate and measure a separate set of reliability parameters. This approach effectively overcomes the computational complexity associated with large Markov models. The results of two case studies used to validate the methodology do indicate that the reliability, availability and maintainability profiles of large single stream Platinum concentrators could be fundamentally different from the conventional multiple stream <b>primary</b> <b>mill</b> configurations...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: External flows are process streams {{that come}} from {{auxiliary}} processes or events. They are re-routed into the ordinary flowsheet since they {{are thought to be}} too valuable to be sent to any tailings pond. External flows come from multiple sources, e. g. drainage sumps, spillage thickeners, depleted products etc. Therefore, external flows may fit or not fit into an existing flowsheet depending on several factors like, flow rate frequency, dilution ratio variation, chemical and mineralogical composition, particle size or particle morphology. By using Particle Texture Analysis to investigate external flows and compare them with existing ordinary flows it is possible to pinpoint from a process mineralogy via point to what extent the external flow fits into the ordinary processing flowsheet. Results from this information category helps to reach a higher quality of process knowledge and control for every step in the concentrator. Results show that some recycled flows reconnected to the main flow are not connected to the best point. A side effectof the analysis is that some flows may be sent to later grinding stages.

40|$|Nebraska’s wood {{products}} manufacturing industry employs more than 2, 200 workers with an output of approximately $ 286 million (U. S. Census Bureau 2002). In this bulletin we discuss recent Nebraska forest industry trends and report {{the results of}} a detailed study of the forest industry, industrial roundwood production, and associated <b>primary</b> <b>mill</b> wood and bark residue in Nebraska in 2006. Such detailed information is necessary for intelligent planning and decision making in wood procurement, forest resources management, and forest industry development. Likewise, researchers need current forest industry and industrial roundwood information for planning projects. The last published report from a detailed study of all industrial roundwood output in Nebraska was in 2000. Most comparisons in this report are with the 2000 results. When new surveys are completed, errors and omissions from previous surveys are corrected. As a result of our ongoing efforts to improve the survey’s efficiency and reliability, changes may have been made to the previous survey’s data.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to gain an {{understanding}} of the environmental impact of hardwood lumber production through a gate-to-gate life-cycle inventory (LCI) of hardwood sawmills in the Southeastern United States (SE). <b>Primary</b> <b>mill</b> data were collected per Consortium on Research for Renewable Industrial Materials (CORRIM) Research Guidelines. Life-cycle impact assessment is beyond the scope of the study. A mill questionnaire was used to survey 12 hardwood sawmills across the SE region. Total annual hardwood lumber production for this region, in 2005 and 2006, was 9. 25 million m 3 (3. 79 billion board feet (ft) 1) and 8. 76 million m 3 (3. 59 billion bf), respectively (USCB 2007; 2008). Annual production for the 12 sawmills surveyed during 2005 and 2006 was greater than 576 thousand m 3 (236 million bf) of rough green lumber, 6 % of the total hardwood annual lumber production of this region for this 2 -year period. Most of the rough green hardwood lumber was not Kiln dry and planed (surfaced) on-site prior to shipping. The surveyed mills had an annual production for rough dry and planed dry lumber of 365 thousand m 3 (171 million bf) and 121 thousand m 3 (71. 8 million bf). The mill questionnaire separated hardwood lumber manufacturing into four main unit processes: logyard, sawing, drying, and planing.

40|$|Grinding {{media in}} coarse {{grinding}} tumbling mills constitute the biggest consumable cost to a comminution processing plant, {{therefore it is}} critically important to minimize associated wear. Secondly, efficient grinding is dependent on tight control of the desired ball size distribution, or else optimum impact breakage cannot be assured. Despite the significance of minitoring ball size distribution for mill operation, no practically deployable systems are currently in industry use to measure it. This paper describes a new method for highly accurate, comprehensive, and rapid determination of ball size distribution. Accurate SAG and AG mill product size control is dependent on appropriate Grate Open Area dimensions. Wear of the grate hole edges or in the plate thickness results in an increase of the open area due to the tapered hole cross section, which can result in oversize product exiting the mill. Conversely, some grate castings feature peening of the edges during mill operation, thereby decreasing open area, and therefore preventing the desireed top size product from exiting the mill. SAG mill throughput requires grate holes to remain open or else throughput is restricted. Many grates in operation are pegged by grinding media to varying degrees of severity. This paper introduces a comprehensive, accurate and rapid method to measure and track the size and pegging status of each and all grate holes in situ, and therefore provides tracking information on the Open Area of a SAG mill. This enables operators to control the <b>primary</b> <b>mill</b> product size and therefore the opportunity to stabilize downstream processes...|$|E

40|$|In most {{integrated}} works, ingots {{are used}} as an intermediate form during the production of steel. These ingots, produced by pouring molten steel into molds, are too large {{to be used as}} input for the finishing mills which produce steel products. Hence, more manageable forms (blooms, billets and slabs) are rolled from the ingots by primary mills. The necessity of having uniformly hot steel, provided by a battery of soaking pits, limits the production capacity of any <b>primary</b> <b>mill.</b> At times there is no hot steel and the mill comes into "nothing hot" delays. It is desirable to reduce these delays to a minimum through proper management of the system. One way of doing so is to properly control the charging into the soaking pits of ingots from the queue which builds up there. The paper investigates the properties of this problem which can be considered in two parts. Firstly, when there are ingots of various temperatures in the queue, which should be charged when space becomes available in the pits? Secondly, if space becomes available when there are no hot ingots in the queue, should the empty pit be kept idle waiting for more to arrive or should it be charged with cold ingots which though readily available require considerably longer to prepare for rolling? There is the possibility of inserted idle time. A model is made of the ingot queue-soaking pit-rolling mill system. The properties of the optimal control policy for the ingot queue are investigated using Markov programming. Results are presented which illustrate its complex state dependent nature. ...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this project}} is to improve energy {{efficiency}} of industrial crushing and grinding operations (comminution). Mathematical models of the comminution process {{are being used to}} study methods for optimizing he product size distribution, so that the amount of excessively fine material produced can be minimized. This will save energy by reducing the amount of material that is ground below the target size, and will also reduce the quantity of materials wasted as ''slimes'' that are too fine to be useful. This will be accomplished by: (1) modeling alternative circuit arrangements to determine methods for minimizing overgrinding, and (2) determining whether new technologies, such as high-pressure roll crushing, can be used to alter particle breakage behavior to minimize fines production. In previous quarters, it was determined that the primary grinding mills were operating at less than full capacity, suggesting that a shift of grinding load to the primary mills could liberate more material before it reached the secondary mills, allowing more complete liberation with a coarser grind. In the eighth quarter, further analysis was carried out to determine {{the full extent of the}} benefit that could be obtained by this shift in grinding load. A key part of this analysis was the development of a correlation of the circuit capacity with (a) ore work index, (b) the quantity of <b>primary</b> <b>mill</b> ''pebbles'' that were crushed by a cone crusher in the circuit, and (c) the fraction of the crushed pebbles that were also processed by a high-pressure roll mill...|$|E

Traditionally, forest carbon budgets {{have focused on the}} biological carbon cycle; however, it is important to include the industrial forest carbon cycle as well. The overall objective {{of this study was to}} quantify the major carbon ?uxes associated with the production of Wisconsin's industrial roundwood, by using life cycle inventory (LCI) methodology to produce an industrial forest carbon budget. To achieve this objective we (1) developed carbon LCIs for the harvest process for three major forest ownerships (state, national, and private non-industrial), (2) developed carbon LCIs for a dimensional lumber and two oriented strand board (OSB) mills and (3) completed a scaled version of 1 and 2 to include more Wisconsin forestlands and to incorporate the other major processes within the industrial forest carbon cycle (e. g. <b>primary</b> <b>mill,</b> secondary mill, product use and product disposal processes of the industrial forest carbon cycle). The carbon budgets for the harvesting process of the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest (CNNF), the Northern Highland American Legion State Forest (NHAL), and the non-industrial private forests that participated in the managed forest laws of Wisconsin (MFL-NIPF) were 0. 10, 0. 18 and 0. 11 tonnes C ha - 1 year - 1), respectively. The dimensional lumber and OSB products were both net carbon sources, and released 0. 05 ? 0. 09 tonnes C/ tonnes C processed). More carbon is sequestered than released within the industrial forest carbon cycle of Wisconsin?s national (6 g C m - 2 year - 1), state (12 g C m - 2 year - 1) and non-industrial private forests (7 g C m - 2 year - 1). Using published net ecosystem production data we estimate that the net forest carbon cycle budget (sum of the biological and industrial C cycle, [Gower, S. T., 2003. Patterns and mechanisms of the forest carbon cycle. Ann. Rev. Environ. Resour. 28, 169 ? 204]) for the CNNF ranges between - 897 and 348 g C m - 2 year - 1.
