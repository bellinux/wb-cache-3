5|$|The disquilibrium and {{perceived}} {{corruption of the}} electoral and political process led, in 1966, to back-to-back military coups. The first coup was in January 1966 and was led by Igbo soldiers under Majors Emmanuel Ifeajuna and Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu. The coup <b>plotters</b> succeeded in murdering Prime Minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, Premier Ahmadu Bello of the Northern Region and Premier Ladoke Akintola of the Western Region. But, the coup <b>plotters</b> struggled to form a central government. President Nwafor Orizu handed over government control to the Army, then {{under the command of}} another Igbo officer, General JTU Aguiyi-Ironsi.|$|E

5|$|In 1907, {{members of}} the Mvog Ada sublineage revolted against the colonial {{government}} over Atangana's appointment as their official interpreter. The plot included a conspiracy to poison Atangana, but word leaked to him. He informed his masters, and on 11 April, six <b>plotters</b> were put to death and two others imprisoned.|$|E
5|$|It is {{unlikely}} that Aubame participated in the planning of the coup. It appears that he joined the effort after being recruited by the new government.

5|$|Singer and cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel chose {{different}} styles for the separate {{halves of the}} film. Elegant camerawork such as cranes were used as the plot builds to the attempt on Hitler's life, and the second half is frantic with handheld cinematography as the <b>plotters</b> are hunted down. The colors in the film also become more intense as the story continues. Sigel focused on red, {{the color of the}} Nazi flag, which he felt represented the violence of their ideology. Singer looked towards thrillers of the 1940s and home movies shot by Eva Braun for inspiration. Shooting scenes at night was difficult because presenting historical accuracy of the era required blackouts. Sigel noted in real life, car headlights were used for the firing squad to aim at and execute the <b>plotters</b> in the Bendlerblock. Singer chose to shoot in 1:85 aspect ratio, and since filming took place in Germany, the director used Arriflex cameras with Zeiss lenses.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to build a <b>plotter</b> for {{printing}} vector graphics on paper. The <b>plotter</b> is computer controlled by a Mach 3 program. Mach 3 is a control software for CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machines. The components of the <b>plotter</b> software are Mach 3 and a G code generating program. Mach 3 has {{a large amount of}} functions because it is intended for CNC machines. However many of these functions are not needed for the <b>plotter.</b> Thus I have only focused on these aspects of control software which affect the <b>plotter.</b> The input of Mach 3 is a G code program. That is why I made a program which transforms vector graphics into a G code. The thesis covers the hardware and software aspect of the <b>plotter.</b> It provides descriptions of designing and building the <b>plotter</b> and making electronic circuits, which are a link between the computer and the device. The focus is on the bipolar stepper motors which are the key part of this device. The electronic circuits transforms input signals into high current signals for driving motors. The <b>plotter</b> design and descriptions of axes mechanisms are also given in the thesis...|$|R

Behind Olbricht's back, Mertz forges his signature and issues the orders anyway. With Operation Valkyrie underway, Stauffenberg and his fellow <b>plotters</b> order the arrest of Nazi party leaders and SS officers, convincing lower officers that the Party and the SS are staging a coup. As Army soldiers begin {{to take control of}} Berlin's government ministries, including SS headquarters, mid-level officers relaying the orders begin to wonder which side they should be fighting for. Rumors reach Berlin that Hitler survived the blast, but Stauffenberg dismisses them as SS propaganda. Meanwhile, Fromm learns from Field Marshal Keitel that Hitler is still alive. The General refuses to join the <b>plotters,</b> resulting in them detaining him. Major Otto Ernst Remer of the Reserve Army prepares to arrest Goebbels, but is stopped when Goebbels connects him by phone to Hitler.|$|E

5|$|During these events, no gunshots were fired. The {{people did}} not react strongly, which {{according}} to the military, {{was a sign of}} approval. A provisional government was formed, and the presidency was offered to Aubame. The government was composed of civilian politicians from both the UDSG and BDG, such as Paul Gondjout. As for the coup <b>plotters,</b> they were content to ensure security for civilians. The small Gabonese army did not intervene in the coup; composed mostly of French officers, they remained in their barracks.|$|E

40|$|For the ViewCorrect project, an x-y <b>plotter</b> is built. This is a {{research}} setup for testing concurrent real-time software. The context of the ViewCorrect project is to bring different disciplines, involved in a mechatronic system project, in a structured way together and therefore making the traditional gap between them smaller. One way of bringing different disciplines together is co-simulation. This project has researched the possibilities to co-simulate the CT-based <b>plotter</b> software written in gCSP with the 20 -sim model that describes the behaviour of the ViewCorrect <b>Plotter</b> setup. The existing model of the ViewCorrect <b>Plotter</b> setup has been adjusted and validated. The difference between simulated and measured model is less than five percent. Next a 3 D animation model and controllers have been designed. The controllers are capable of controlling {{the position of the}} pen. The <b>plotter</b> software has been made in gCSP. A workflow is presented which allows the user to make a drawing in a CAD drawing package and plot this drawing with the <b>plotter.</b> The controllers, designed in 20 -Sim, and the safety layer are embedded in the <b>plotter</b> software.

5|$|On 8 February 1963, the Iraqi Regional Branch, led by Ali Salih al-Sa'di, {{took power}} in Iraq by overthrowing Abd al-Karim Qasim. He {{was a far}} more {{formidable}} opponent than al-Kudsi, and the Iraqi Regional Branch managed to take power through an alliance not only with military officers, but also with segments of the middle class. Qasim's downfall changed the rules of Arab politics – the Nasserists had monopolised the Arab nationalist movement since the UAR, but the takeover made the Ba'ath Party {{a force to be}} reckoned with. In contrast to the Iraqi regional branch, the Syrian regional branch did not have mass support or a significant support base in the middle class. While Aflaq cautioned the <b>plotters</b> because of the party's lack of support, they failed to share his worries, and launched the coup on 7 March. However, that day the military intelligence raided the apartment where the <b>plotters</b> were planning to assemble. Assad was given the task of reporting to other units that the coup had been postponed to 8 March.|$|E

5|$|According to a post-war {{account by}} Karl Strölin, the Oberbürgermeister of Stuttgart at that time, {{he and two}} other conspirators, Alexander von Falkenhausen and Carl Heinrich von Stülpnagel, began efforts to bring Rommel into the anti-Hitler {{conspiracy}} in early 1944. On 15 April 1944 Rommel's new chief of staff, Hans Speidel, arrived in Normandy and reintroduced Rommel to Stülpnagel. Speidel had previously been connected to Carl Goerdeler, the civilian leader of the resistance, {{but not to the}} <b>plotters</b> led by Stauffenberg, and only {{came to the attention of}} Stauffenberg due to his appointment to Rommel's headquarters.

5|$|Another {{result of}} the coup was that the work {{that had been done}} by British {{intelligence}} with the anti-Axis government of Cvetković and Maček was lost. By supporting the coup <b>plotters,</b> the SOE undermined the balance in Yugoslav politics that had been achieved by the Cvetković–Maček Agreement. Serb nationalists supported and welcomed the coup because it ended Croatian autonomy under the Agreement and freed them to pursue a Greater Serbia agenda. The coup and its immediate aftermath also contributed to the paralysis within the Yugoslav government-in-exile {{during the rest of the}} war, due to ongoing disputes regarding the legitimacy of the Cvetković–Maček Agreement.|$|E
