50|$|In {{the case}} of Cartagena, the World Bank has {{estimated}} efficiency gains by comparing {{the evolution of the}} ratio of collected revenues to operational costs (<b>operating</b> <b>ratio)</b> on the one hand to that of the average tariff level on the other hand. The <b>operating</b> <b>ratio</b> is driven essentially by two factors: the evolution of operational costs and collection rates, which are controlled by the private operator, and the evolution of the average tariff, which is exogenous. Whenever the <b>operating</b> <b>ratio</b> increases faster than the tariff, efficiency gains are taking place. The Cartagena privatization achieved significant improvements in efficiency. This is reflected in the doubling over a decade (1995 - 2005) in the ratio of collected revenues to operational costs. At the same time, the average tariff was halved in real terms, suggesting that {{a significant portion of the}} savings achieved through efficiency gains was passed to customers.|$|R

Urban transportation on route 03 and 04 have a route which overlapping with the route of BST, the route 03 overlapping with BST corridor 3 and route 04 overlapping with BST corridor 5. It usually affect the number of passengers and income of the both route. This study examines the information of service performance on urban public transport in route 03 and 04 at Surakarta area, viewed from the aspect of headway, the waiting time of passengers, travel speed, travel time, availability, load factor and <b>operating</b> <b>ratio</b> by using the standard Performance Indicators Services Public Transport according to Department of Indonesian Transportation and Public Transportation Performance Indicators which refers to the World Bank standard.

40|$|The <b>operating</b> <b>ratio</b> (OPR) {{is a key}} {{statistic}} {{in several}} modes of transportation. Historically it {{had been used to}} set rates for motor carriers and to judge railroad performance. As a basic measure of carrier profitability, it was useful in the past air transportation as a measure of airline efficiency and as a compliment to the so-called “fair rate of return ” standard used by the now defunct Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), which sunset in 1985. Defined as the <b>ratio</b> of <b>operating</b> expenses to operating revenues, it was an alternative to that standard set in the several past fare investigations when the airlines were heavily regulated. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to explore the use of the <b>operating</b> <b>ratio</b> for a different purpose. It can be used as an indicator of air carrier risk at the operating level as it can be input into an equation that will gauge the operating volatility of a carrier or the industry. That equation states that the volatility of operating profit given a change in revenues can be measured by the following: e = 1 %/[1 -OPR] Where e is defined as the percentage change in operating profit given a 1 % change in operating revenues and t is the tax rate faced by the carrier. It is an alternative measure to the concept of the degree of financial leverage (DOL) discussed in many financial management textbooks. This paper will examine the <b>operating</b> <b>ratio</b> for the US airline industry and compare its volatility to that a large sample of other industrial and transportation firms. It will be shown that the airline industry is very high in what financial theory defines as business risk. As such, the OPR can be useful in making decisions on optimal and operating financial strategies to be followed by the carriers...|$|R
