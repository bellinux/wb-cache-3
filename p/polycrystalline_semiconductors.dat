First-principles calculations show that it has lower formation energies than the prototype GBs adopted widely in previous studies.

This thesis discusses methods for altering the crystallization kinetics of Si and Ge {{in order to}} obtain large-grained <b>polycrystalline</b> <b>semiconductor</b> thin films or size-selected semiconductor nanocrystals in silicon dioxide. Reduction of grain boundaries in <b>polycrystalline</b> <b>semiconductor</b> thin films is important for improving the performance of microelectronic devices because grain boundaries act as traps for charge carriers. Control of nanocrystal size and concentration in silicon dioxide is important in controlling the nanocrystal photoluminescence and electroluminescence characteristics. Results of modification of crystal nucleation and growth rate via ion beam irradiation, thermal annealing, metal-induced crystallization, and dopant enhanced solid phase epitaxy are presented. Ion beam irradiation was used to induce amorphization of 1 - 50 nm Si crystals in amorphous Si. A size-dependent amorphization rate was calculated from the temporal evolution of the crystal size distribution under ion irradiation. A model for irradiation- induced, size-dependent crystal growth/amorphization is developed and it shows good quantitative agreement with the present experiment as well as other experiments. Precipitation of 1 - 10 nm Ge nanocrystals and 1 - 2 nm Si nanocrystals in silicon dioxide was accomplished by ion implantation followed by thermal annealing. Nucleation of 1 - 2 nrn Ge nanocrystals occurred during implantation, and annealing at temperatures higher than 600 [ [...] . ]C induced coarsening. Increasing the Ge implantation dose resulted in increased nanocrystal concentration but not size. In contrast, no Si nanocrystals were observed in as-implanted samples or samples annealed at less than 1000 [ [...] . ]C.
