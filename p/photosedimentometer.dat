40|$|The {{principles}} of particle sizing using a disc centrifuge <b>photosedimentometer</b> are reviewed. The {{importance of the}} extinction correction for accurate measurements is emphasized. Results on the ASTM A 4 through F 4 series of reference blacks is presented. Comparisons between reference materials are made. Different sample preparations are discussed. Stability of such preparations with time is shown...|$|E
40|$|The {{practical}} {{performances of}} single and multi-angle photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) for resolving bimodal distributions of industrial poly (methyl methacrylate) samples {{was investigated in}} a comparative study by several users affiliated to academic and industrial groups and by two suppliers of commercial equipment. The results for the harmonic intensity averaged diameters obtained by cumulants analysis reported by the different laboratories are in agreement, {{in addition to the}} results for the normalized second cumulants. The uncertainty on the latter quantities is large, however. For the bimodal samples with two populations with average diameters in a ratio of about 2. 5 : 1, not all users were able to resolve the distribution in its components by single-angle PCS. Some slight improvement was obtained by multi-angle PCS. Other indirect techniques (polarization intensity differential scattering, static light scattering data and disc <b>photosedimentometer)</b> appeared to be superior for resolving the bimodal distributions...|$|E
40|$|Polybutadiene (I) latexes prepd. by emulsifier-free {{emulsion}} polymn. {{and having}} particle diam. 50 - 300 nm for both unimodal and bimodal particles size distributions {{were analyzed by}} the line-start (LIST) method in a Brookhaven disk centrifuge <b>photosedimentometer.</b> A special spin fluid {{was designed to be}} able to sediment I since the d. of the polymer is 0. 89 g/cm 3 and is thus less dense than its suspending medium. D. and viscosity gradients were created simply by adding 5 different mixts. of EtOH, water, and emulsifier in d. sequence to the spinning disk. Coagulation problems caused by dilg. I latexes with EtOH were overcome by using the nonionic surfactant Triton X- 100. Good agreement in the av. particle size and distribution as well as polydispersity was obtained between transmission electron microscopy and disk centrifuge data. The anal. time for I latex particle sizing thus was reduced from several days to approx. 1...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Modem disc {{centrifuge}} technology has extended {{the range of}} application of sedimentation particle size analysis to include the submicron region. An overall size range of approximately 10 nm to 100 /tm is now accessible. The principles of both the disc centrifuge <b>photosedimentometer,</b> which employs optical detection with full Mie light scattering corrections, and the X-ray disc centrifuge are described. Examples of their application toa variety of samples are given to illustrate the performance characteristics of the instruments including a direct comparison f resolving power {{with that of the}} laser diffraction technique. Particle size is well {{recognized as one of the}} fundamental parameters which determine the properties of clays and other minerals and the techniques which have been devised to measure particle size distribution are extremely diverse. Each method has its attractions but it is important o select one which meets the actual requirements of the application in question; versatile as many current instruments may be, the one which does everything has yet to be produced (Weiner & Fairhurst, 1992). The disc centrifuge sedimentation techniques described here are especially suited to the high-resolution size distribution analysis of particles from about 10 nm to 100 #m or so i...|$|E
