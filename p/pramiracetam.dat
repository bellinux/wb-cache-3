50|$|<b>Pramiracetam</b> is {{a central}} nervous system {{stimulant}} and nootropic agent belonging to the racetam family of drugs. It is marketed by Menarini under the brand name Pramistar {{as a treatment for}} memory and attention deficits in aging people with neurodegenerative and vascular dementias in Italy and some Eastern European countries.|$|E
50|$|The parent {{compound}} {{in which the}} AMPA modulating activity was first characterised was the well known nootropic drug aniracetam. Several drugs in the racetam family have been reported as producing ampakine effects, but while this has been well established for some compounds such as aniracetam and <b>pramiracetam,</b> it is unclear {{if all of the}} racetam family act in this way, as the racetam drugs appear to have multiple modes of action.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pramiracetam</b> was {{discovered}} by scientists at Parke-Davis, at that time a division of Warner-Lambert, in the late 1970s; patents expired in 1996. Warner-Lambert conducted clinical trials in Alzheimer's Disease and abandoned that indication after Phase II trials showed mixed results; it then began to develop it as an orphan drug {{as an adjunct to}} electroconvulsive therapy for major depressive disorder, in part {{to take advantage of the}} administrative exclusivity provided by the orphan status. It licensed European rights to Menarini which continued developing it for dementias, and in 1991 it licensed US and other non-European rights to Cambridge Neuroscience, Inc, (CNI) which pursued the ECT indication, as well as a use in restoring cognitive function after stroke or traumatic brain injury. [...] CNI obtained the orphan designation for the ECT use from the FDA in 1991, which was later withdrawn when CNI abandoned the drug.|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} of the title compound, C 14 H 28 N 3 O 2 +·HSO 4 −, a nootropic drug (<b>pramiracetam)</b> investigated for cognition-enhancing properties, is closely {{similar to that of}} the previously determined acetonitrile solvate, both structures being characterized by the presence of ribbons of hydrogen-bonded ions. The pyrrolidine ring adopts an envelope conformation...|$|E
40|$|Using neuromorphometry {{analysis}} {{differences in}} the effects of nootropic drugs on morphology and function of neurons and endothelial cells of hippocampus, content of RNA, content of apoptotic and destructive neurons were examined in white rats with chronic alloxan-induced hyperglycemia. It ha s been found that diabetes in rats is accompanied by specific morphological and functional changes and activation of apoptosis in neurons of the CA 1 -area in hi ppocampus, which {{may be related to}} disturbance of local blood flow due to endothelial damage. N-carbamoyl-methyl- 4 -phenyl- 2 -pyrrolidone (entrop), N-phenylacetyl-L-prolylglycine (noopept), <b>pramiracetam,</b> cerebrocurin and citicoline show protective effects on neurons and endothelial cells, which are much larger in force than effect s of ginkgo biloba extract, piracetam and pentoxifylline. This protective activity is characterized by reducing the number of apoptotic and dest ructive neurons in hippocampal CA 1 -area, increasing the density of functioning nerve and endothelial cells, activation of RNA biosynthesis in the neurocytes and endo-thelial cell...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{nootropic}} drugs Piracetam (Pir) and <b>Pramiracetam</b> (Pram) were evaluated on recognition-memory of rats in a new one-trial test. This test is based on spontaneous exploratory activity and does not involve rule learning or reinforcement. Recognition {{is measured by the}} time spent by rats in exploring two different objects, one familiar (the sample), the other new. When the retention interval is 1 min, normal rats spend more time exploring the new object which demonstrates that they recognize the familiar one, but they do not discriminate between the two objects after a 24 -h interval. Three doses of Pram (15, 30 and 60 mg/kg) and Pir (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg) were administered i. p. 30 min before the acquisition trial. The doses of 30 mg/kg of Pram and of 400 mg/kg of Pir produced a significant improvement in retention when the intertrial interval was 24 h. This effect was not associated with a change in overall exploratory behavior. This study shows that the new object-recognition test may be a useful tool for pharmacological studies of memory in rats...|$|E
