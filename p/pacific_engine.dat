5000|$|SP 9113 (ex-9010) was {{converted}} into a [...] "Camera Car" [...] between 1968 and 1969 at the Sacramento General Shops. Its purpose was to record picture and audio to create the background motion plates and sound effects for a computerized locomotive simulator for engineer training, developed by Conductron-Missouri, a subsidiary of McDonnell-Douglas. This pioneering six-axis-of-motion locomotive simulator was housed in a fixed-base operation in Southern California. Called the [...] "Southern <b>Pacific</b> <b>Engine</b> Service Training Center", it was located in Cerritos, California.|$|E

50|$|After {{the success}} of this record-holding locomotive, Hammel {{designed}} a <b>Pacific</b> <b>engine</b> for Bavaria, based on the Class IVf engines built by Maffei for the Baden State Railways. This new express locomotive, the Bavarian S 3/6 (later the DRG Class 18.4-5), illustrated right, was a major success and continued to be built by the DRG. For many enthusiasts this is the most beautiful German steam locomotive and its popularity is testified by the numerous models produced in recent years by manufacturers such as Roco, Märklin and Trix.|$|E
5000|$|... 231 G 558 was a <b>Pacific</b> <b>engine</b> of the État, {{built in}} 1922. It {{had a career}} pulling express {{passenger}} trains on the Paris-Chartres-Bordeaux, Paris-Niort, Paris-Saintes, Paris-Cherbourg, and Paris-Le Havre runs. It ended its career on the run between Nantes and Le Croisic, and pulled its last train on 29 September 1968 when it was moved to Angers. In 1969 it was used in Dieppe as a heater for ferries. The SNCF wished to sell the engine for scrap in 1971, but the depot manager in Sotteville got the engine transferred to his depot in 1972. After five years of campaigning, the engine was sold to the depot staff for the token price of one franc. The engine was listed for preservation on 4 June 1984. After 8,000 man-hours of work, the engine was made fit for mainline use. The engine was reviewed and received its timbre, a stamp showing {{the pressure of the}} boiler, on 28 November 1985 and was certified for mainline use on 30 May 1986. The Princess, as it is nicknamed, made its first run to Paris on 29 June 1986.|$|E
5000|$|Service between Jersey City, New Jersey and Buffalo {{began on}} 18 May 1896, [...] It {{originally}} used the Pennsylvania Railroad's Exchange Place Station, where passengers could board ferries to station to New York. In 1913, {{the train was}} forced by the PRR to vacate the station so the eastern terminus was changed to the Central Railroad of New Jersey's Communipaw Terminal. That lasted only five years, as the United States Railroad Administration decided in 1918 to re-route all Lehigh Valley trains into New York Penn Station to centralize traffic. For most of its existence the Black Diamond used the Lehigh Valley Terminal in Buffalo.The Black Diamond competed with services offered by the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad and the New York Central Railroad; although slower than either of these, its level of service won it the nicknames [...] "the Handsomest Train in the World" [...] and [...] "the Honeymoon Express." [...] In 1940 the train was provided with the line's first set of lightweight streamlined coaches, designed by Otto Kuhler, who also designed streamlined shroudings for the existing 4-6-2 Pacific locomotives that hauled the train. Later, the <b>Pacific</b> <b>engine</b> was replaced by Alco's PA-1, which was painted Cornell red with black playing a secondary role. The black was used in a role similar to the [...] "cat whiskers" [...] that appeared on the PRR's GG-1's.|$|E

5000|$|Fittingly for a {{train ride}} {{sponsored}} by the Union Pacific, the Omaha Zoo Railroad was initially themed after the UP's First Transcontinental Railroad route, for which Omaha was the eastern terminus. Passengers boarded at the [...] "Omaha train depot" [...] located in the Aksarben Nature Kingdom (today known as Red Barn Park) and rode to [...] "Promontory Junction" [...] {{at the south end}} of the zoo's lagoon, where they had the option of disembarking at the small depot and catching a later train back to Omaha. The ride also featured a climb up the 6% grade of [...] "Sherman Hill", named for the Union Pacific's own grade over the continental divide in Wyoming. The steam locomotive was painted and decorated to resemble Union Pacific's No. 119, the famous locomotive used in the laying of the real [...] "Golden spike" [...] marking the transcontinental line's completion, and the four coaches were given names significant to the UP's history. The UP influence was perhaps most evident in the Omaha Zoo Railroad's logo: a Union Pacific shield with a smiling tiger superimposed over it. Though the direct references to Union Pacific place names have faded over the years, UP's support of the zoo railroad has remained strong. For years the train equipment was trucked to the Union Pacific's Omaha shops for winter maintenance, and when the shops closed much of the machinery was donated to build a new shop on site at the zoo. The Union <b>Pacific</b> <b>Engine</b> House, as this building is called, was dedicated in July 1994. Union Pacific crews continue to maintain the crossing signals along the zoo railroad's route.|$|E

5000|$|Sir Herbert Nigel Gresley [...] (19 June 1876 - 5 April 1941) {{was one of}} Britain's {{most famous}} steam {{locomotive}} engineers, who rose to become Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). He was the designer {{of some of the}} most famous steam locomotives in Britain, including the LNER Class A1 and LNER Class A4 4-6-2 <b>Pacific</b> <b>engines.</b> An A1 <b>pacific,</b> Flying Scotsman, was the first steam locomotive officially recorded over 100 mph in passenger service, and an A4, number 4468 Mallard, still holds the record for being the fastest steam locomotive in the world (126 mph).|$|R
5000|$|Many steam {{locomotives}} were streamlined {{during this}} time to attract passengers, and the first steam streamlined locomotive was the New York Central's Commodore Vanderbilt. Nonetheless, some of these steam locomotives became very fast - some were said to exceed 120 mph on a regular basis. Examples include the New York Central's [...] "Super Hudsons" [...] as used on the Twentieth Century Limited; the Milwaukee Road's purpose-built Atlantics and Hudsons used in Hiawatha service; the Pennsylvania Railroad's duplex-drive 4-4-4-4 type T1 locomotives, and two Union <b>Pacific</b> <b>engines,</b> a 4-6-2 and a 4-8-2, used on the [...] "Forty Niner" [...] and other trains.|$|R

5000|$|... 1957 - Southern <b>Pacific</b> steam <b>engine</b> #982 was {{dedicated}} at Hermann Park and the Mini-train service was established. The engine was saved after a newspaper letter from Peter Whitney got 75 replies and Southern <b>Pacific</b> donated the <b>engine</b> to the Junior Chamber of Commerce and the city. It took 5 days {{to move it}} from Blodgett to the Park, as rails were laid in the streets in front of it. The locomotive was relocated by 50 wheel trailer to Minute Maid Park in 2005.|$|R
50|$|The LNER also {{classified}} <b>pacific</b> tank <b>engines</b> with A-numbers, {{and these}} were initially classified A5-7, and were eventually joined by a class A8. However, because of their different lineage and operational use, they are not further considered here.|$|R
25|$|On May 25, 2013, in Chaffee, Missouri, a Union Pacific train {{collided}} with a BNSF train at a level junction. Seven people were injured. A total of 24 cars were derailed, including loaded autorack and scrap metal cars. Included in the crash were two Union <b>Pacific</b> <b>engines.</b> The accident caused an overpass to partially collapse, and a post-accident fire was also reported. The resulting investigation concluded the engineer most likely fell asleep, due to sleep apnea. In this incident, four progressively restrictive signals where violated, resulting in the UP train hitting the BNSF train at roughly 40 MPH. Total damages exceeded ten million dollars. The Missouri Route M bridge was reopened in August, 2013 with a new design.|$|R

We arrived at Rawlins at midnight. The snow was thicker than ever. Here the engine was to go into the round-house, being replaced by a fresh engine. As the train came to a stop, I dropped off the engine steps plump into the arms of a large man in a large overcoat. He began asking me questions, and I promptly demanded who he was. Just as promptly he informed me that he was the sheriff. I drew in my horns and listened and answered.|$|R
50|$|The Sydney-bound Bourke Mail train, with 110 passengers, was {{steaming}} towards Geurie station. The locomotive was C38 <b>Pacific</b> steam <b>engine,</b> 3817.
