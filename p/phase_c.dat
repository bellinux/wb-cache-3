40|$|The {{cytoskeleton}} globally reorganizes between mitosis (M <b>phase)</b> and cytokinesis (<b>C</b> <b>phase),</b> which presumably requires extensive regulatory changes. To reveal these changes, we {{undertook a}} comparative proteomics analysis of cells tightly drug-synchronized in each phase. We identified 25 proteins that bind selectively to microtubules in <b>C</b> <b>phase</b> and identified several novel binding partners including nucleolar and spindle-associated protein. C phase-selective microtubule binding {{of many of}} these proteins depended on activity of Aurora kinases as assayed by treatment with the drug VX 680. Aurora-B binding partners switched dramatically between M <b>phase</b> to <b>C</b> <b>phase,</b> and we identified several novel C phase-selective Aurora-B binding partners including PRC 1, KIF 4, and anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome. Our approach can be extended to other cellular compartments and cell states, and our data provide the first broad biochemical framework for understanding <b>C</b> <b>phase.</b> Concretely, we report a central role for Aurora-B in regulating the <b>C</b> <b>phase</b> cytoskeleton...|$|R

We then apply Landau theory to study the second-order phase transitions from the A to the <b>C</b> <b>phase.</b> For each symmetry of the A phase we find the allowed molecular orderings and corresponding symmetries in the <b>C</b> <b>phase</b> below Tc. We also find the dipole orderings allowed in each case considered.

25|$|Cebus a. versicolor is {{a complex}} which {{includes}} dark populations and lighter populations. It is thought to include the subspecies C. a. leucocephalus and C. a. pleei. Herskovitz's description of C. a. pleei is of a very reddish animal, particularly in its limbs while C. a. versicolor is a lighter red. C. a. leucocephalus {{was described as a}} dark brown animal with reddish tonalities in the hind legs. Nevertheless, Hernández-Camacho and Cooper discuss evidence that the three subspecies (C. a. leucocephalus, C. a. pleei and C. a. versicolor) could be subsumed into one subspecies (C. a. versicolor), since the variations seem to be found in a very well-defined zone and even in the same groups, close to Barrancabermeja on the eastern bank of the middle Magdalena River in the Department of Santander. This strongly suggests that the dark <b>phase</b> (<b>C.</b> a. leucocephalus) and the light <b>phase</b> (<b>C.</b> a. pleei) are extremes of an intermediate (C. a. versicolor).|$|E

40|$|AbstractVapour {{pressure}} measurements were performed {{in terms of}} a non-isothermal isopiestic method to determine vapour pressures of Cd in the system Cd–Gd between 693 and 1045 K. From these results thermodynamic activities of Cd were derived as a function of temperature for the composition range 52 – 86 at. % Cd. By employing an adapted Gibbs–Helmholtz equation, partial molar enthalpies of mixing of Cd were obtained for the corresponding composition range, which were used to convert the activity values of Cd to a common average sample temperature of 773 K. The relatively large variation of the activity across the homogeneity ranges of the <b>phases</b> <b>Cd</b> 2 Gd and Cd 45 Gd 11 indicates that they probably belong to the most stable intermetallic compounds in this system. An activity value of Gd for the two <b>phase</b> field <b>Cd</b> 6 Gd+L was available from literature and served as an integration constant for a Gibbs–Duhem integration. Integral Gibbs energies are presented between 51 and 100 at. % Cd at 773 K, referred to Cd(l) and α-Gd(s) as standard states. Gibbs energies of formation for the exact stoichiometric compositions of the <b>phases</b> <b>Cd</b> 58 Gd 13, Cd 45 Gd 11, Cd 3 Gd and Cd 2 Gd were obtained at 773 K as about − 19. 9, − 21. 1, − 24. 8, and − 30. 0 kJgatom− 1, respectively...|$|R

25|$|Earliest Neolithic {{sites in}} the flood plains of Kashmir valley are dated to c. 3000 BCE. Most {{important}} of these sites are the settlements at Burzahom, which had two Neolithic and one Megalithic phases. First <b>phase</b> (<b>c.</b> 2920 BCE) at Burzahom is marked by mud plastered pit dwellings, coarse pottery and stone tools. In the second phase, which lasted till c. 1700 BCE, houses were constructed on ground level and the dead were buried, sometimes with domesticated and wild animals. Hunting and fishing were the primary modes of subsistence though evidence of cultivation of wheat, barley, and lentils has also been found in both the phases. In the megalithic phase, massive circles were constructed and grey or black burnish replaced coarse red ware in pottery. During the later Vedic period, as kingdoms of the Vedic tribes expanded, the Uttara–Kurus settled in Kashmir.|$|E
25|$|Radiocarbon dating {{currently}} {{indicates a}} 1200-year duration {{for the use}} of the Beaker pottery on the Balearic Islands, between c. 2475 BC and 1300 BC (Waldren and Van Strydonck 1996). There has been some evidence of all-corded pottery in Mallorca, generally considered the most ancient Bell Beaker pottery, possibly indicating an even earlier Beaker settlement about 2700 BC. However, in several regions this type of pottery persisted long enough to permit other possibilities. Suárez Otero (1997) postulated this corded Beakers entered the mediterranean by routes both through the Atlantic coast and through eastern France. Bell Beaker pottery has been found in Mallorca and Formentera but has not been observed in Menorca or Ibiza. Collective burials in dolmen structures in Ibiza could be contrasted against the individual burials in Mallorca. In its latest <b>phase</b> (<b>c.</b> 1750–1300 cal BC) the local Beaker context became associated with the distinctive ornamented Boquique pottery demonstrating clear maritime links with the (megalithic) coastal regions of Catalonia, also assessed to be directly related to the late Cogotas complex. In most of the areas of the mainland Boquique pottery falls into the latter stages of the Bell Beaker Complex as well. Along with other evidence during the earlier Beaker period in the Balearics, c. 2400–2000 BC, as shown by the local presence of elephant ivory objects together with significant Beaker pottery and other finds (Waldren 1979 and Waldren 1998), this maritime interaction can be shown to have a long tradition. The abundance of different cultural elements that persisted towards the end of the Bronze Age, show a clear continuity of different regional and intrusive traditions.|$|E
