METHODS: 810 immigrants of three language sub-groups were recruited by purposive-sampling. Using self-reports, respondents answered questions regarding <b>Physical</b> Activity <b>Change</b> and Demography in Multicultural Lifestyle Change Questionnaire of English, French or Chinese version. Data were analyzed statistically in percentage, correlation, regression and factor analysis. RESULTS: Immigrants of different gender, language and category sub-groups exhibited different rates in <b>Physical</b> Activity <b>Change,</b> and different language sub-groups displayed different Physical Exercise Items rates after immigration, but no statistical difference between the rates. <b>Physical</b> Activity <b>Change</b> (<b>Physical</b> Activity Behavior <b>Change</b> + <b>Physical</b> Activity Belief <b>Change)</b> was negatively correlated with Gender, Category of Immigration, Employment Status and Primary Occupation. <b>Physical</b> Activity Behavior <b>Change</b> was negatively correlated with Age, Gender, Category of Immigration, Employment Status and Primary Occupation. Age, Gender, Category of Immigration and Employment Status significantly impacted <b>Physical</b> Activity <b>Change.</b> Mother Tongue, Age, Gender, Category of Immigration and Employment Status significantly impacted <b>Physical</b> Activity Behavior <b>Change.</b> Two factors (factor one: <b>physical</b> activity behavior <b>change</b> factor and factor two: <b>physical</b> activity belief <b>change</b> factor) influenced significantly <b>Physical</b> Activity <b>Change.</b> Factor one exposed more significant effect than factor two. CONCLUSIONS: Different immigrant sub-groups experienced different <b>Physical</b> Activity <b>Change</b> and three language sub-groups presented different physical activity patterns after immigration. Age, Gender, Category of Immigration, Employment Status and Primary Occupation were main factors impacting significantly <b>Physical</b> Activity <b>Change.</b> Mother Tongue was an important factor influencing significantly <b>Physical</b> Activity Behavior <b>Change.</b> Culture and acculturation were relating contributing factors.

5|$|Kimlinger of Anime News Network {{said that}} while Naruto's initial fight scenes are lacking {{conviction}} when compared to others, his encounter with Gaara {{is one of his}} best moments because its tactics surpassed most shōnen stereotypes. ANN's Theron Martin and Mania Entertainment's Justin Rich made similar comments. The character's final fight against Sasuke at the end of Part I attracted similar responses, due to the fighting styles employed, and the character development resulting from their rivalry. The enormous <b>physical</b> <b>changes</b> caused by the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox have also been the focus of critics, as Naruto's loss of control causes him to become a bigger threat to his loved ones than other series' antagonists. Carlo Santos of ANN commented on the character's growth in Part II, specifically his fight against Pain in which Naruto's comments on peace, and the means by which it is achieved, touch on philosophical themes never seen in a shōnen series. Chris Beveridge of Mania Entertainment noted a change in Naruto's attitude as he acts calmly and more seriously than in previous story arcs. Naruto's new Senjutsu style was praised, as was his careful preparation for the fight against Pain, which resulted in a detailed display of his skills. Allega Frank from Polygon noted that during the start of both the manga and anime Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, multiple fans were worried in regards to a flashforward; in this sequence an older Boruto is facing an enemy named Kawaki who implies Naruto might be dead so his fate left them worried. Singer Diana Garnet expressed her pleasure at recording one of the ending theme songs for the animated series of Naruto Shippuden stating that not only she has been a fan of the series ever since she was younger, but was also motivated by Naruto's character because of his determination not to give up no matter what challenge he faced.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{exploration}} {{and analysis of}} the spatial form and structure of <b>physical</b> <b>change</b> within an American suburb. Typified as middle class, residential, and single family, one finds in such settings detached one or two story houses on 1 / 8 to 1 / 4 acre lots. One central argument is that <b>physical</b> <b>change,</b> or change of spatial form and structure, is a requisite concern within all built environments, including suburbia. The second argument is that <b>physical</b> <b>change</b> (ought to be) is guided by the existing spatial form and structure of the built environment (suburbia) such that the resulting environment manifests similar patterns of spatial form. The purpose of the thesis is to bring to rational, objective consideration a particular type of <b>physical</b> <b>change</b> which is occurring in suburbia yet is to a certain extent denied and not accepted. If such change is to be properly managed and to be used to the advantage of the greatest number of suburban residents, it must become a legitimate topic for public discussion. This thesis attempts to enable and facilitate the discussion through the presentation of a rational and systematic understanding of how <b>physical</b> <b>change</b> does/would/could come about and through an understanding of the environmental consequences of such change. The particular mode of <b>physical</b> <b>change</b> considered here and occurring in many lower density, middle class, residential suburbs is being referred to as "consolidation". The term, consolidation, is defined as the extension of and the building from current residential investments in housing and infrastructure in order to provide additional housing units without disrupting the existing built environment. The objective confronted in this thesis, in relation to consolidation, is to enable more and a greater variety of households to live in suburbia while guaranteeing these households and existing residents the maintenance of a certain degree of environmental qualities. In addition, such housing must be affordable to purchase and maintain, and tailored to a variety of household sizes and configurations. by Brent Seppanen. Thesis (M. S.)
