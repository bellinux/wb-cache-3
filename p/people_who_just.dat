She {{wanted to be a}} singer, and he was tired of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>just</b> wanted to be famous. They were both hard workers, and he kept her schedule filled with lucrative contracts. She also writes that she was forbidden to read the press, and, having peeked at some of it, was content to follow that rule. Stark, of course, had a heavy hand in manipulating the press. Mireille writes that her mother was often surprised to read on the front page that she was engaged to someone famous, or {{was going to be in}} a movie by some famous director. Her guiding principle was just to sing, and never have her family return to the tenements of Croix des Oiseaux.|$|E
25|$|A drag queen is a person, usually male, who {{dresses in}} {{clothing}} {{of the opposite}} sex and often acts with exaggerated femininity and in feminine gender roles for the purpose of entertainment or fashion. Often, they will exaggerate certain characteristics such as make-up and eyelashes for comic, dramatic, or satirical effect. While drag is very much associated with gay men and gay culture, there are drag artists of all sexualities. There are many kinds of drag artists and they vary greatly in dedication, from professionals who have starred in films to <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>just</b> try it once, or those who simply prefer clothing and makeup that is usually worn by the opposite sex in their culture. Drag queens can vary widely by class and culture. Other drag performers include drag kings, women who perform in male roles and attire, faux queens, who are women who dress in an exaggerated style to emulate drag queens, and faux kings, who are men who dress to impersonate drag kings.|$|E

500|$|With Chelsea {{unable to}} garner maximum points in their next two matches, Arsenal knew before their game away at Tottenham that a draw would {{guarantee}} {{their status as}} champions. Cole returned for the derby, after sitting out the Leeds match with an ankle injury. Arsenal took an early lead when Vieira finished off a counter-attacking move. Incisive football brought about the second goal, ten minutes before the break. Bergkamp passed the ball to Vieira, who cut it back for Pirès to sidefoot. Tottenham replied {{in the second half}} by scoring twice – the equaliser a penalty – but it did not stop the Arsenal players celebrating at the final whistle [...] "in front of their supporters' White Hart Lane enclave". This marked the second time the club had been crowned league champions at their rivals' ground: the first time had been in 1971. Wenger praised his team for their success, telling the BBC: [...] "We've been remarkably consistent, haven't lost a game and we have played stylish football.

I love the character, and I love that people are passionate about her. I know {{there are a lot of}} <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>just</b> can't stand her. And that's why it's so important to have that character in the mix." [...] Kirshner defended Jenny stating: [...] "Jenny's a very controversial character. I think the great thing about her is the fact that she's so flawed." [...] During season two Jenny is seen coming out, getting her hair cut and becoming best friends with Shane McCutcheon (Katherine Moennig). AfterEllen.com stated that Jenny cutting off her hair was a defining moment in her development because it also symbolized her cutting all of the bad stuff that happened before out of her life. Jenny's transition continued into season three, Chaiken stated: [...] "We find Jenny coming together, I predict this [...] that Jenny will be more likable and accessible to the audience than she has ever been.

The announcement led to panned reception amongst Netflix's Facebook followers, who posted negative comments on its wall. Twitter comments spiked a negative [...] "Dear Netflix" [...] trend. The company defended its decision during its initial announcement of the change:"Given the long life we think DVDs by mail will have, treating DVDs as a $2 add-on to our unlimited streaming plan neither makes great financial sense nor satisfies <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>just</b> want DVDs. Creating an unlimited-DVDs-by-mail plan (no streaming) at our lowest price ever, $7.99, does make sense and will ensure a long life for our DVDs-by-mail offering."In a reversal, Netflix announced in October that its streaming and DVD-rental plans would remain branded together.|$|E

Although seemingly niche, the wint MP account garnered 14,000 followers by May 2017. Tom Dissonance, the creator of wint MP, attributed the account's success to its functioning as a joke on multiple levels, and for multiple audiences: [...] "there are people who get the in-jokey references; there's a broader level of people who get politics and dril, and understand the significance of one commenting on another; and beyond that there are <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>just</b> appreciate an official figure in a suit saying something ridiculous.

Jones was nominated for the Times Breakthrough Award at the 2010 South Bank Show Awards, the last ever ceremony, but lost to David Blandy. When discussing her nomination she said, [...] "You do question 'What am I breaking through?'

2500|$|In the 1950s Federal Republic, {{restitution}} {{laws for}} compensation {{for those who}} had suffered under the Nazis was limited to only those who had suffered from [...] "racial, religious or political reasons", which were defined {{in such a way as}} to sharply limit the number of people entitled to collect compensation. According to the 1953 law on compensation for suffering during the National Socialist era, only those with a territorial connection with Germany could receive compensation for their suffering, which had the effect of excluding the millions of people, mostly from Central and Eastern Europe, who had been taken to Germany to work as slave labor during World War II. In the same vein, to be eligible for compensation they would have to prove that they were part of the [...] "realm of German language and culture", a requirement that excluded most of the surviving slave laborers who did not know German or at least enough German to be considered part of the [...] "realm of German language and culture". Likewise, the law excluded homosexuals, Gypsies, Communists, Asoziale ("Asocials"-people considered by the National Socialist state to be anti-social, a broad category comprising anyone from petty criminals to <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>just</b> were merely eccentric and non-conformist), and homeless people for their suffering in the concentration camps under the grounds that all these people were [...] "criminals" [...] whom the state was protecting German society from by sending them to concentration camps, and in essence these victims of the National Socialist state got what they deserved, making them unworthy of compensation. In this regard it is significant that the 1935 version of Paragraph 175 was not repealed until 1969. As a result, German homosexuals-in many cases survivors of the concentration camps—between 1949 and 1969 continued to be convicted under the same law that had been used to convict them between 1935 and 1945, though in the period 1949–69 they were sent to prison rather than to a concentration camp.|$|E
