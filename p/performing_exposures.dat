They were incubated at 37 °C with 5 % CO 2 in a humidified incubator. For AuNP exposure, cells were plated at densities of 7.5 × 104 cells per millilitre in 96 -well tissue culture microtiter plates (Greiner-Bio one, CellStar, Madrid, Spain) and subsequently incubated for 24 h. After this period, cells were exposed to a series of concentrations of the five AuNP preparations for either 2 or 24 h for ROS production studies or for 24 or 48 h for the cytotoxicity studies. AuNP suspensions were prepared in high-grade Milli-Q water to achieve a stock concentration of 1, 000 μg/ml. All stock preparations were stored at 4 °C. AuNP working concentrations were prepared from the 1, 000 μg/ml stock preparations in EMEM/S + or EMEM/S-. Given the different size and stability profiles found for the AuNPs when suspended in these two types of medium, as shown by UV–vis, DLS and TEM analysis, we <b>performed</b> <b>exposures</b> in medium with and without serum.

40|$|Many {{workers are}} daily exposed to {{chemical}} risks {{in their work}} place {{that has to be}} assessed and controlled. Due to exposure variability, repeated and random measurements should be conducted for valid estimates of the average exposure. Traditionally, experts such as safety engineers, work environment inspectors, and occupational hygienists, have performed the measurements. In self assessment of exposure (SAE), the workers <b>perform</b> unsupervised <b>exposure</b> measurements of chemical agents. This thesis studies a prerequisite for SAE, i. e. the workers’ mental models of chemical exposure. Further, the workers’ mental models are contrasted with experts’ reasons and decision criteria for measurement. Both qualitative and quantitative data generated from three studies (Paper I, II, and III) were used to describe the workers’ mental model of chemical exposure. SAE was introduced to workers in three different industries; transports (benzene), sawmill industry (monoterpenes), and reinforced plastic industry (styrene). By interviews, qualitative data were collected on the workers’ interpretation of measurement results and preventive actions. To evaluate the validity of worker measurement, the measurements were compared with expert measurements. The association between each worker’s number of performed measurement and mean level and variability in exposure concentrations was calculated. Mean absolute percent/forecast error (MAPE) was used to assess whether the workers’ decision models were in accordance with a coherence or correspondence model. In Paper IV, experts (safety engineers, work environment inspectors, and occupational hygienists) were interviewed to elucidate their mental models about the triggers and decision criteria for exposure measurements. The results indicate that the workers’ measurement results were in agreement with experts’. However, the measurement results were not a strong enough signal to induce workers to take preventive actions and sustained exposure measurements even if the measurement result were close to the occupational exposure limit. The fit was best for the median model, indicating that the workers’ mental models for interpretation of measurement data can best be described by the coherence theory rather than by the correspondence theory. The workers seemed to mentally reduce the variation in the exposure to a measure of central tendency (the median), and underestimated the average exposure level. The experts were found to directly take preventive actions instead of <b>performing</b> <b>exposure</b> measurements. When they <b>performed</b> <b>exposure</b> measurements, a worst case sampling strategy was most common. An important trigger for measurement for the experts was “request from the employer” (safety engineers), “legal demands” (work environment inspectors), and “symptoms among workers” (occupational hygienists). When there was a trigger, all experts mentioned expectations of high exposure level as a decision criterion for measurements. In conclusion, the studies suggest that workers’ mental interpretation model is best described in terms of a coherence model rather than a model of correspondence. The workers reduced the variation mentally in favor of an estimate of average exposure (median), which may imply that they underestimate short-term, high exposure health risks. A consequence is that interpretation of measurements such as SAE cannot be given to the individual worker without some support, e. g. from an expert. However, experts often chose to directly take preventive actions, without measuring the exposure. The results indicate that also the experts need support e. g. from the legal system if exposure measurements are to be done...|$|R

METHODS [...] From a cross-sectional respiratory survey, 26 men who reported work-related asthmatic symptoms on a validated questionnaire were selected for repeated measurements of bronchial responsiveness to methacholine. Regular analyses of plasma fluoride levels were <b>performed.</b> <b>Exposure</b> to fluoride and total particulates was assessed from routine surveillance of the workplace. Bronchial responsiveness was expressed as the dose-response slope of the line through the origin and last data point. RESULTS [...] A positive association was found between bronchial responsiveness and plasma fluoride levels, such that {{an increase in the}} plasma fluoride level of 10 ng/ml was associated with an increase in the dose-response slope by a factor of 1. 11 (95 % confidence interval 1. 05 to 1. 17). Plasma fluoride levels were associated with the total atmospheric fluoride concentration in mg/m 3 (beta = 28. 1), but not with total particulates in the environment. CONCLUSIONS [...] Bronchial responsiveness in aluminium potroom workers reporting work-related asthmatic symptoms appears to be related to plasma levels of fluoride.

During the years 2000 – 2008, the committee reviewed 99 cases of HBV-infected health care workers. Fifty of them were found to <b>perform</b> <b>exposure</b> prone procedures (EPPs). Because of high levels of HBV DNA (> 100, 000 copies/ml), a ban on performing EPPs was applied in 11 / 50 cases; 25 / 50 low-viremic health care workers were allowed to continue EPPs while their HBV load was being monitored; and 14 / 50 cases had stopped working or changed profession.

40|$|The {{presence}} of environmental chemicals in breast milk has {{gained increased attention}} from regulatory agencies and groups advocating women’s and children’s health. As the published literature on chemicals in breast milk has grown, there remains a paucity of data on parameters related to infant exposure via breast-feeding, particularly those with a time-dependent nature.

The limitations of the existing data restrict our ability to predict infant body burdens of these chemicals from breast-feeding. Although the data indicate a decrease in breast milk dioxin toxic equivalents over time for several countries, the results for the United States are ambiguous.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the evaluation of}} the 2006 proposal for the risk assessment of persistence of plant protection products in soil. The proposal considered three protection goals and proposed tiered assessment and decision schemes for each protection goal. The three schemes appeared to be consistent, both internally and with each other. It was found that both pore water concentrations and total content have to be considered in the soil risk assessment. The evaluation has been performed for five substances with all available information from both registration dossiers and open literature. Nevertheless, insufficient information was available to evaluate all aspects of the proposal. In practice this means that pesticide industry has to provide additional information for many dossiers. Furthermore, it was found that existing information often needs to be re-interpreted and a need for standardisation of evaluation of terrestrial (semi-) field experiments was observed. The proposal would require specific expertise and investments of evaluating authorities as well as stakeholders. To better understand fate and effects of persistent substances, it is recommended to investigate the behaviour of substances in the field over longer periods, to <b>perform</b> <b>exposure</b> concentration measurements while performing ecotoxicological tests, to develop protocols for testing effects on fungi, and to gain the necessary experience on the conduct and interpretation of (semi-) field studies with respect to the relation between exposure and effects of plant protection products...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In many crustaceans, {{changing}} {{concentrations of}} several {{low molecular weight}} compounds modulates hemocyanin oxygen binding, resulting in lower or higher oxygen affinities of the pigment. The nonphysiological effector caffeine and the physiological modulator urate, the latter accumulating in the hemolymph of the lobster Homarus Vulgaris during hypoxia, increase hemocyanin oxygen affinity and decrease cooperativity of oxygen binding. To derive a model that describes the mechanism of allosteric interaction between hemocyanin and oxygen {{in the presence of}} urate or caffeine, studies of oxygen, urate, and caffeine binding to hemocyanin were <b>performed.</b> <b>Exposure</b> of lobster hemocyanin to various pH values between 7. 25 and 8. 15 resulted in a decrease of p 50. In this pH interval, p 50 decreases from 95 to 11 Torr without effectors and from 49 to 6 Torr and from 34 to 5 Torr in the presence of 1 mM urate or caffeine, respectively. Thus, the allosteric effects induced by protons and urate or caffeine are coupled. In contrast, isothermal titration calorimetry did not reveal any differences in binding enthalpy (¢H°) for urate or caffeine under either normoxic or hypoxic conditions at different pH values. Despite these apparently conflicting results, they {{can be explained by the}} nested MWC model if two different types of modulator binding sites are assumed, an allosteric and a nonallosteric type of site. Simulations of in ViVo conditions with this model indicate that the naturally occurring modulator urate is physiologically relevan...|$|R
