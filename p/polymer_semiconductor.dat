[...] University of Washington, 2015 There {{has been}} {{tremendous}} {{progress in the}} development of conjugated <b>polymer</b> <b>semiconductors</b> {{in the last two decades}} for diverse applications in organic electronics and photonics. Most notably, advances in p-type (hole-conducting) polymers have enabled the development of high-performance organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) as well as more efficient fullerene-based organic photovoltaics (OPVs). In contrast, n-type (electron-conducting) <b>polymer</b> <b>semiconductors</b> remain relatively scarce and consequently the performance of n-channel OFETs and all-polymer solar cells has lagged far behind p-channel OFETs and fullerene-based OPVs. This dissertation mainly focuses on the design and synthesis of new n-type <b>polymer</b> <b>semiconductors</b> for device applications in n-channel OFETs and non-fullerene OPVs. It aims to achieve better understanding of the relationships between molecular structure, processing, morphology, and device performance. New n-type <b>polymer</b> <b>semiconductors</b> were developed based on strong electron withdrawing naphthalene diimide (NDI) building block with various selenophene derivatives as co-monomers. The resulting highly crystalline poly(naphthalene diimide) s (PNDIs) gave the electron mobility as high as 0. 24 cm 2 /Vs in n-channel OFET measurements in air which is comparable or even higher mobility compared to most of the p-channel transistors. Using NDI-selenophene copolymer, PNDIS-HD, as acceptor, a photovoltaic performance with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3. 3 % (Jsc = 7. 78 mA/cm 2, Voc = 0. 76 V, FF = 0. 55) was achieved in all-polymer solar cells, and this work has stimulated a lot of current interest in fullerene-free OPVs. In further studies in all-polymer solar cells, highly enhanced photovoltaic performance was achieved by chemical modifications of acceptor polymers and controlling self-organization kinetics of polymer/polymer blend films. From these studies, a critical role of the bulk crystallinity of acceptor polymer was revealed, and provided an important criterion for the molecular design of high performance polymer acceptors. Furthermore, all-polymer solar cells with more favorable bulk morphology by slow self-organization of polymers facilitated by room temperature film aging resulted in enhanced charge carrier mobility and photocurrent.

40|$|As {{the most}} {{promising}} semiconductor candidates for organic thin film transistors (OTFTs), donor-acceptor (D-A) type π-conjugated polymers have received much attention in the recent years. Their excellent printability, light weight, mechanical robustness and flexibility are desirable characteristics for low cost and portable electronics. Some issues of <b>polymer</b> <b>semiconductors</b> as such relatively low charge carrier mobility {{compared to that of}} silicon as well as the poor stability during manufacturing and device operation in an ambient environment still remain. Although extensive efforts have been made to develop electron acceptor building blocks, which are considered to be critical for achieving high mobility, very few electron acceptors for constructing novel high performance D-A polymers are available. Nowadays most D-A polymers were synthesized using traditional Suzuki or Stille coupling, which use boron- or tin-containing monomers that require extra synthetic steps and are highly toxic in some cases (such as organotin monomers). As an alternative method, the direct (hetero) arylation polymerization (DHAP), provides a new approach to constructing D-A polymers in a cost-effective and environment friendly manner. Certain polymers synthesized by DHAP have demonstrated similar or even better performance compared to the polymers made by other methods. However side reactions and limitations on the types of monomers for DHAP have been reported. To bring the OTFT performance of <b>polymer</b> <b>semiconductors</b> to the next level, new acceptor building blocks and a further study of DHAP need to be exploded. In {{the first part of this}} thesis (Chapters 2 - 4), a novel electron acceptor building block, indigo is chosen, considering its electron deficiency property, highly coplanar geometry and ease of synthesis. Furthermore, indigo and its small molecule derivatives have been demonstrated to be promising semiconductors in OTFTs. However, indigo-containing <b>polymer</b> <b>semiconductors</b> have not been reported yet. In this study, we used 6, 6 ’-indigo as an electron acceptor to successfully develop several n-type electron transport semiconductors. Surprisingly, when 5, 5 ’-indigo was used, the opposite p-type hole transport performance was observed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first observation that the charge transport polarity could be controlled or switched through different regiochemical connections of a building block. The second part of this thesis (Chapters 5 and 6) focuses on the optimization and development of dipyrrolopyrrole (DPP) based polymers. In Chapter 5, DHAP is used to construct a novel high performance pyrrolo[3, 4 -c]pyrrole- 1, 4 (2 H, 5 H) -dione (1, 4 -DPP) -thiazole based polymer. Two synthetic routes are compared and discussed, and the polymer synthesized under optimized DHAP conditions showed better performance than that of a similar polymer obtained by Stille coupling. In Chapter 6, pyrrolo[3, 4 -c]pyrrole- 1, 3 (2 H, 5 H) -dione (1, 3 -DPP), an isomer of 1, 4 -DPP, is developed for constructing <b>polymer</b> <b>semiconductors</b> with promising performance in OTFTs.

This dissertation focuses on studies of OFETs and aims to better understand the charge transport properties of <b>polymer</b> <b>semiconductors</b> and factors that influence the performance of OFETs. Case studies of structure-morphology-property relationships in unipolar p- and n-channel polymer OFETs as well as ambipolar OFETs reveal that variations in molecular structure and processing affect electronic energy levels, solid-state morphology and crystallinity, and thus the magnitude and polarity of charge carriers. The studies resulted in achievement of high-performance OFETs with high charge-carrier mobility of up to 0. 3 cm 2 /Vs. The morphology and electronic energy levels are also related to ambient stability and durability of polymer OFETs through kinetics and thermodynamics of interaction between the semiconductor and extrinsic molecules in ambient air.
