40|$|ZnS:Cu,Cl,Mn,Te, {{which shows}} red AC <b>powder</b> <b>electroluminescence</b> (ACPEL) emission, was {{synthesized}} using a conventional wet synthesis and a sealed vessel method. The photoluminescence (PL) and ACPEL were characterized. After the second firing, 0. 5 wt % tellurium (Te) -doped ZnS: Cu,Cl,Mn,Te phosphor shows almost red PL emission from the 4 T 1 – 6 A 1 transition of Mn 21 ions, which {{are affected by}} the Te. Extended x-ray absorption fine structure analysis on the Mn K edge proved that the substitution of sulfur (S) with Te changes the local crystal field of theMn 21 ions and shifts an orange emission (; 588 nm) to a red emission (; 650 nm). A red ACPEL emission is first shown in 0. 5 wt%Te-doped ZnS:Cu,Cl,Mn,Te after the third firing phosphor even though its luminance is not very high. The origin of the ACPEL emission is assumed to be not a CuxS–ZnS p–n junction but a CuxTe–ZnS p–n junction. Raman spectra were characterized to support that the red ACPEL emission is probably attributed to a CuxTe–ZnS p–n junction. I...|$|E
40|$|Sulfide-based {{luminescent}} {{materials have}} attracted {{a lot of}} attention {{for a wide range of}} photo-, cathodo- and electroluminescent applications. Upon doping with Ce 3 + and Eu 2 +, the luminescence can be varied over the entire visible region by appropriately choosing the composition of the sulfide host. Main application areas are flat panel displays based on thin film electroluminescence, field emission displays and ZnS-based <b>powder</b> <b>electroluminescence</b> for backlights. For these applications, special attention is given to BaAl 2 S 4 :Eu, ZnS:Mn and ZnS:Cu. Recently, sulfide materials have regained interest due to their ability (in contrast to oxide materials) to provide a broad band, Eu 2 +-based red emission for use as a color conversion material in white-light emitting diodes (LEDs). The potential application of rare-earth doped binary alkaline-earth sulfides, like CaS and SrS, thiogallates, thioaluminates and thiosilicates as conversion phosphors is discussed. Finally, this review concludes with the size-dependent luminescence in intrinsic colloidal quantum dots like PbS and CdS, and with the luminescence in doped nanoparticles...|$|E
40|$|A series {{resistance}} – capacitance equivalent circuit {{has been used}} to describe a single layer AC <b>Powder</b> <b>Electroluminescence</b> (ACPEL) lamp in operation. The two crucial components of this practical equivalent circuit are frequency and voltage dependent and have been independently determined for a single layer ACPEL device over a range of 50 – 800 Hz and 10 – 150 V. The organic binder containing a ferroelectric component is mainly responsible for determining the capacitive element since it acts in series with a larger capacitative contribution mainly from the phosphor. The series resistive element will be determined by mainly the phosphor particles, and the remarkable changes in the effective {{series resistance}} and capacitance of the lamp structure are shown to be brought about by the activation of the ZnS phosphor. The effective resistance is consistent with a model where conductivity is governed by the average charge recombination time under given internal field and frequency conditions. Using the effective resistance and capacitance values of our equivalent circuit, the average rate of energy dissipation can be easily calculated as a function of applied voltage and frequency. For sinusoidal waveforms, first indications are that efficacy will be optimized at low voltages, but only weakly dependent on frequency. © The Author(s) 2014. Published by ECS.

40|$|This letter {{proposes a}} new method for {{reducing}} power consumption and enhancing the luminous efficiency of <b>powder</b> inorganic <b>electroluminescence</b> devices by introducing a composite dielectric layer into their structure. The composite dielectric layer contains a composite BaTiO(3) -carbon nanotube (CNT) film, which is formed by adding single-wall CNTs into a BaTiO(3) layer. With an appropriate CNT mixing ratio, the power consumption decreased {{by more than}} 30 %, and the luminous efficiency increased by approximately 50 % at a brightness of 400 nits and an operation frequency of 1 kHz...|$|R
