5|$|Maggie {{asks the}} group for help to remove a bloated walker that fell into a {{freshwater}} well before it contaminates the water. Glenn (Steven Yeun) is lowered down and saddles the walker with rope to <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>out,</b> but as the group pulls it out, its body is ripped in half, its lower half falling back into the well and contaminating it. Maggie and Glenn decide to venture to the local pharmacy to find more supplies. Before he leaves, Lori asks Glenn to find a pregnancy test for her. At the pharmacy, Glenn is flustered with Lori's request, and Maggie seduces and has sex with him before they return.|$|E
5|$|The retiarius was {{routinely}} {{pitted against}} a heavily armed secutor. The net-fighter {{made up for}} his lack of protective gear by using his speed and agility to avoid his opponent's attacks {{and waiting for the}} opportunity to strike. He first tried to throw his net over his rival. If this succeeded, he attacked with his trident while his adversary was entangled. Another tactic was to ensnare his enemy's weapon in the net and <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> of his grasp, leaving the opponent defenseless. Should the net miss or the secutor grab hold of it, the retiarius likely discarded the weapon, although he might try to collect it back for a second cast. Usually, the retiarius had to rely on his trident and dagger to finish the fight. The trident, as tall as a human being, permitted the gladiator to jab quickly and keep his distance. It was a strong weapon, capable of inflicting piercing wounds on an unprotected skull or limb. The dagger was the retiariuss final backup should the trident be lost. It was reserved for when close combat or a straight wrestling match had to settle the bout. In some battles, a single retiarius faced two secutores simultaneously. For these situations, the lightly armoured gladiator was placed on a raised platform and given a supply of stones with which to repel his pursuers.|$|E

25|$|Stout's second {{government}} lasted considerably {{longer than}} his first. Its primary achievements were {{the reform of}} the civil service and a program {{to increase the number}} of secondary schools in the country. It also organised the construction of the Midland railway line between Canterbury and the West Coast. The economy, however, did not prosper, with all attempts to <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> of depression failing. In the 1887 election, Stout himself lost his seat in parliament to James Allen by twenty-nine votes, thereby ending his premiership. Harry Atkinson, Stout's old rival, was able to form a new government after the election.|$|E
25|$|A stuff gag is {{very similar}} to, and works {{in the same way}} as, the ball gag. The person's mouth is stuffed with handkerchiefs, scarves, socks, hosiery, panties, day sheers, bandanas or any item rolled into a ball, acting as a stopper. To reduce the chances of choking, the stuff gag is never pushed all the way into the person's mouth. Instead, a large part of it hangs out of the mouth, {{allowing}} the top to <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> easily when he/she has to. Sometimes, to further ensure that the gag does not accidentally slip deeper into the person's mouth, the top may use a larger gag. It is then secured with a cleave gag, cloth gag or tape gag.|$|E
500|$|During {{the podium}} interview, {{conducted}} by Ted Kravitz, {{a reporter for}} Sky Sports F1, Lewis Hamilton expressed delight at his victory, saying that he needed the victory after the disappointment of Monaco. While he stated that the car suffered from understeer throughout the race, {{he felt that he}} [...] "always had it under control", saying: [...] "I had a bit of time in my pocket to be able to <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> when I needed to, so it was never too serious." [...] In turn, Nico Rosberg felt that his qualifying performance on Saturday [...] " [...] that big difference" [...] and had cost him the chance at victory.|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} of the Punic wars of the 3rd century BC, the Camillan {{organisational}} system had been found to be inefficient. Under a new Polybian system, infantry were sorted into classes according to age and experience rather than wealth, with the hastati being the youngest and least experienced. Their equipment and role was very similar to that which existed under the previous system, except they now carried swords, or gladii, instead of spears. Each hastatus also carried two pila, heavy javelins that, according to Goldsworthy [...] "contrary to deeply entrenched myth" [...] did not bend on impact to make any struck shield useless or prevent the weapon from being thrown back. The weight and barb alone sufficiently hampered any struck shield (often penetrating the shield to hit the man behind it), and the iron was sufficiently hard that pila were often used as hand-held spears against both infantry and cavalry. By the time the volley of pila had reached the enemy line (usually only fifteen yards distant for best effect), the legionaries were charging and very quickly at work with their swords. There was rarely any time for the foe to find a pilum, <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> of whatever it had hit and throw it back.|$|E
2500|$|Also debuting in April was {{the release}} of a {{cannabis}} vapor pen dubbed the [...] "Grassroots Uplifter." [...] A play on words after two album titles by the band. [...] "The sleek, state-of-the-art original Uplifter™ pen – designed in-house by 311 [...] – requires no recharging, no refilling and is easy, discreet and convenient to use. [...] Just <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> and hit it. No cartridges, USB chargers or anything else needed." [...] The pen will be available in Colorado, Washington, Oregon and California.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{foundation}} {{mentioned in}} the Mahavamsa is the Maricavatti vihara, the modern [...] Legend has it that traveling to {{the shore of the}} Tank of Tissa with the 'women of the harem' for a water-festival, Dutugemunu planted his spear (which contained a sacred relic) in the soft ground. When preparing to return to the palace, he found that neither he, nor anyone in his retinue, could <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> Taking this as a sign he ordered the construction of a stupa over the spear.|$|E

2500|$|In {{another version}} of Scottish sword dancing, the Highlander danced on a targe shield, this has {{similarities}} with an ancient Roman exercise in which the man standing on a shield had to defend himself and stay upright while others tried to <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> from under him. Many of the Highland dances now lost to us were once performed with traditional weapons that included the Lochaber axe, the broadsword, targe & dirk and the flail, the old Skye dancing song, [...] "Buailidh mi thu anns a' cheann," [...] (I will strike your head) indicate some form of weapon play to music, 'breaking the head' was the winning blow in cudgelling matches throughout Britain, [...] "for the moment that blood runs an inch anywhere above the eyebrow, the old gamester to whom it belongs is beaten, and has to stop." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1461, Mehmed fitted out a fleet {{comprising}} 200 galleys, and ten warships. At the same time, Mehmed crossed the Dardanelles to Bursa with the Army of Europe and assembled the Army of Asia; one authority estimates the combined force consisted of 80,000 infantry and 60,000 cavalry. According to Doukas, as word of the Sultan's preparations circulated the inhabitants of places as far apart as Lykostomion (or Chilia Veche) {{at the mouth of}} the Danube, Caffa in the Crimea, Trebizond and Sinope, and the islands of the Aegean Sea as far south as Chios, Lesbos and Rhodes, whether or not they had acknowledged his hegemony, all worried they would be his target. This appears to have been Mehmed's intent, for when later asked by a confidante where this force was destined, the Sultan scowled and said, [...] "Be certain if I knew one hair of my beard knew my secret, I would <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> and consign it to the flames." ...|$|E
2500|$|Two more near-disasters on May 17 led to {{the naming}} of {{additional}} features. [...] William Clark was nearly bitten by a rattlesnake while exploring a creek on the northern side of the river. [...] This creek was named Rattlesnake Creek (although today it is called Timber Creek). [...] The party camped near a creek {{on the south side}} of the river that evening. [...] Clark saw a fortified Native American lodge a short distance up the creek, believing it to be an Atsina (Gros Ventre) site. Late that night, a cottonwood tree sheltering the camp caught fire from sparks rising from the expedition campfire. [...] The men were barely able to get out of their tent and <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> of the way before the tree came crashing down on the site. [...] Lewis named this Burnt Lodge Creek (although today it is known as Seven Blackfoot Creek). [...] On May 20, the expedition passed the Musselshell River. On May 22, the party passed another creek, which they decided to name Sacajawea Creek. (Later renamed Crooked Creek, the U.S. government formally changed the name back to Sacagawea Creek in 1979.) The Corps of Discovery left the CMR NWF on May 24 or 25, after spending a week passing through and exploring the area.|$|E

2500|$|In April 1989, Symington {{announced}} {{his bid for}} Governor of Arizona in the 1990 election, promising to run the state like a business. Beginning with {{the initial stages of}} his campaign, Symington had placed his business expertise and his success as a real estate developer center stage, stating, [...] "What Arizona needs right now is a business mind. The state needs a man who can provide experienced, professional fiscal management to <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> of its economic crisis. I am that man." [...] In the Republican primary held on September 11, 1990, Symington was opposed by several high-profile career politicians, including former Governor Evan Mecham, who had been impeached in 1988 and was attempting to make a comeback. Former U.S. Congressman Sam Steiger, who had previously run for U.S. Senate as the Republican nominee in 1976 and for Governor as the Libertarian nominee in 1982 also ran against Symington, but placed a distant fourth behind Mecham and State Senator Fred Koory. Despite being portrayed as a liberal by his primary opponents, Symington received nearly 44% of the vote in the primary. In his election night speech, Symington immediately began his general election campaign message by stating that his Democratic opponent, Terry Goddard, was [...] "a professional politician, a tax-and-spend Dukakis liberal Democrat," [...] and, in contrast, that he was a Barry Goldwater conservative, and [...] "proud of it." [...] At the time, Goldwater was seen as the ideological godfather of the modern Republican Party, and had endorsed Symington's campaign. Symington's father was also personal friends with Goldwater.|$|E
