40|$|The {{effects of}} wood ash and PK {{fertilization}} on natural regeneration and sowing of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) were studied in field experiments on nitrogen-poor (Ntot 0. 87 – 1. 26 %) peat substrates. The study material {{was derived from}} three drained, nutrient-poor pine mires (64 ° 52 'N, 25 ° 08 'E) at Muhos, near Oulu. The experimental fields were laid out in 1985 as a split-split-plot design including the following treatments: mounding, natural regeneration and sowing and fertilization; PK {{at a level of}} 400 and wood ash 5000 kg ha– 1. The seedlings were inventoried on 648 circles and vegetation on 324 circles in July–August 1991. Changes in the vegetation were small and there were no statistical differences due to the fertilization treatments in the ground vegetation. PK or ash fertilization did not cause vegetational changes harmful to Scots pine regeneration on nitrogen-poor peatlands. Both sowing and fertilization significantly increased the number of pine seedlings, but not their height. Wood ash increased seedling number more than <b>PK</b> <b>fertilizer.</b> The number of seedlings varied from 7963 (control) to 42 781 ha– 1 (mounding + sowing + ash). The number of pine seedlings even on non-mounded, non-fertilized naturally regenerated plots was adequate for successful regeneration. The number of birch seedlings varied more than that of pine (370 – 25 927 ha– 1). Mounding especially increased the number of birches. The difference between <b>PK</b> <b>fertilizer</b> and ash was less pronounced than that for pine. In addition to the field studies the effects of ash and <b>PK</b> <b>fertilizer</b> on the germination of Scots pine seeds was studied in a greenhouse experiment.

The aim of research was to find changes in phytocenology, production, nutrition and economy under different treatments of fertilization, cutting and experimental years. In the structure of semi natural grass vegetation, grasses dominated in the first cuttings, clovers dominated in the second cuttings and other meadow herbs dominated in the third cuttings.

40|$|The {{oversupply}} {{of organic}} fertilizers causes {{an urgent need}} for alternative treatments of manure. CO 2 neutral electricity is produced from poultry manure, a renewable fuel which is relatively dry and has a heating value of 6 e 8 MJ/kg. The electricity production from manure saves emissions from fossil fuel combustion, resulting in a reduced environmental impact in the impact category climate change. Moreover, as manure contains {{a large amount of}} ammoniacal N, and due to nitrification and denitrification processes, land spreading of poultry manure causes larger emissions of NH 3, N 2 O and NOx than combustion. Electricity production from manure therefore outperforms land spreading in the impact categories terrestrial acidification, particulate matter formation, marine eutrophication and photochemical oxidant formation. The fluidized bed combustor of BMC in the Netherlands generates zero waste, as the ash is recovered as a <b>PK</b> <b>fertilizer,</b> which is odorless, dry, sterile and has a lower mass and volume than the manure, making it more suitable for export to regions with a high P demand.

40|$|Chemical {{composition}} of soil organic carbon (SOC) is central to soil fertility. We hypothesize that change in SOC content resulting from various long-term fertilization strategies accompanies the shift in SOC chemical structure. This study examined the effect of fertilization strategies along with the time of fertilizer application on the SOC composition by 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The soils (Aquic Inceptisol) subjected to seven fertilizer treatments were collected in 1989, 1999 and 2009, representing 0, 10 and 20 years of fertilization, respectively. The seven fertilizer treatments were (1 - 3) balanced fertilization with application of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) including organic compost (OM), half organic compost plus half chemical fertilizer (1 / 2 OM), and pure chemical NPK fertilizer (NPK); (4 - 6) unbalanced chemical fertilization without application {{of one of the}} major elements including NP fertilizer (NP), <b>PK</b> <b>fertilizer</b> (PK), and NK fertilizer (NK); and (7) an unamended control (CK). The SOC content in the balanced fertilization treatments were 2. 3 - 52. 6 % and 9. 4 - 64. 6 % higher than in the unbalanced fertilization/CK treatments in 1999 and 2009, respectively, indicating significant differences in SOC content with time of fertilizer application between the two treatment groups. There was a significantly greater proportion of O-alkyl C and a lower proportion of aromatic C in the balanced fertilization than in unbalanced fertilization/CK treatments in 1999, but not in 2009, because their proportions in the former treatments approached the latter in 2009. Principal component analysis further showed that the C functional groups from various fertilization strategies tended to become compositionally similar with time. The results suggest that a shift in SOC chemical composition may be firstly dominated by fertilization strategies, followed by fertilization duration...|$|E
40|$|Meat {{and bone}} meal (MBM) is a {{valuable}} co-product of the rendering industry. Its feed and fertilizer uses were restricted in the EU in 2002 {{as a result of}} the occurrence of BSE crisis. Consequently, MBM was land filled, incinerated or used as an alternative fuel in cement production. The re-allowance of the fertilizer use of MBM in the EU since spring 2006 together with the rising prices of industrial nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers have resulted in amplified research and use of MBM as a fertilizer. Additionally, growing consciousness of both finiteness of resources and deteriorating environmental effects of the artificial fertilizer use have contributed to growing popularity of nutrient recycling. The fertilizer effect and the nutrient uptake efficiencies of the Finnish MBM (N-P-K-Ca 8 – 6 - 0. 5 - 15 %) compared to mineral counterparts were tested for in present study. Additionally, the fertilizer effect of MBM in mixture with two potassium fertilizers was tested for. A greenhouse experiment with ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) fertilized with five fertilizers (MBM, mineral fertilizers Y 4 PK and NK, two mixtures of MBM and potassium fertilizers) was conducted from 2007 to 2008 in Department of Agricultural Sciences greenhouses in University of Helsinki, Finland. Each of the fertilizers was applied on three nitrogen levels (80, 160 and 240 kg N ha- 1). Four additional reference treatments (0 kg N ha- 1 fertilizer, PK I, PK II and PK III) were included. Six cuts of ryegrass were cut and the yields were recorded. Post-harvest plant and soil analyses were conducted. MBM was shown to be a highly effective N and P fertilizer with fertilizer effect similar or even longer lasting than artificial Y 4 <b>PK</b> <b>fertilizer.</b> Additionally, unlike highest application levels of mineral fertilizer Y 4 PK and NK, meat and bone meal treatments did not lower the pH level of the soil. Therefore, it can be concluded that the relatively high Ca content of MBM is useful in preventing further costs for liming the soil. The nutrient uptake efficiencies of MBM were generally somewhat lower than for mineral counterparts. That could be partly attributable to possible immobilization of MBM-N to soil and partly to lower readily plant-available P content of MBM than mineral fertilizers. However, as significant amount of MBM-P is still available for following years, it is justified to use MBM only once in a crop rotation. That makes MBM an especially effective complementary N and P fertilizer for organic farming, where most of the nitrogen need in crop rotation is covered with legumes and manure. The fertilizing potential for mixture of MBM and K fertilizers was shown to be rather high. However, the lack of affordable potassium sources suitable for organic farming is a recognized challenge. Additional research is needed for convalescing MBM as NPK fertilizer...|$|E

Four fertilizers were used: apatite, biotite, Rauta-PK (TM) (apatite and ferrosulphate) and a test fertilizer (50 % apatite and 50 % recycled iron phosphate). Forest plots with four different types of nutrient balance (deficient P and deficient K, deficient P and sufficient K, sufficient P and deficient K, and sufficient P and sufficient K) were studied. The effects on EMM biomass and ectomycorrhizal (EM) biomass in roots were estimated by ergosterol and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis using in-growth mesh bags. Nutrients and rare-earth elements in EM roots surrounding the mesh bags were quantified and used as indicators of nutrient transport by the EMM in the mesh bags. The biomass of EMM was enhanced by P, K and PK deficiency of the trees, and EM fungal biomass in the roots was increased by P deficiency. The test fertilizer enhanced EMM biomass in all the plots studied, whereas the other fertilizers did not have any significant effect. No significant interactions between the P and K availability of host and mycelial fertilizer response could be detected. Deficiency of P or K or both in needles did not affect the concentrations of rare-earth elements in the tree roots. Earlier results from laboratory experiments have shown reduced carbon allocation to EM fungi under K deficiency, but this was not the case in these mature forests. Instead, we observed increased EMM biomass in response to both P and K deficiency...|$|R

Indeed, {{there is a growing}} interest from many owners into these species with intensive management, which are compatible with the implantation of silvopastoral systems. The fertilization {{is one of the most}} controversial management practices that is used for reducing rotation length. The implantation of legumes, which are able to fix atmospheric nitrogen, could allow reducing the economic costs of these plantations, improve the pasture production and quality and optimize their environmental functions. The objective of this project is to study the response of trees and pasture in a silvopastoral system established in an intensive hardwood plantation, to the implantation of legumes as nitrogen fertilizer, and its environmental implications. This study was developed in various plantations of 15 -s year old walnut in Extremadura (Spain). Three treatments were tested: mineral fertilization (NPK), sowing of legumes (complemented by <b>PK</b> mineral <b>fertilizers)</b> and control treatment, combined with three levels of irrigation. The nutritional and physiological status of trees were analyzed, as well as their growth. In addition, pasture production, available nutrients (N,P,K) in soil and nitrate leaching were studied. The implantation of legumes, which improved the available nutrients in soil, and the mineral fertilization treatments, both produced similar pasture production, tree growth and nitrogen content in tree leaf, and higher than the control treatment. However, there was no differences in physiological status of trees and organic matter content in soil. Respect to nitrate leaching, the highest values was observed in the uppermost soil layer (0 - 30 cm), especially in legume treatment, but there was no difference among treatment under this deep, that reduces groundwater pollution.

The experiment included seven treatments: organic manure, half organic manure N plus half fertilizer N, fertilizer NPK, fertilizer NP, <b>fertilizer</b> NK, <b>fertilizer</b> <b>PK,</b> and the control (without fertilization). N fertilization greatly increased soil nitrification potential, and mineral N fertilizer had a greater impact than organic manure, while N deficiency treatment (PK) had no significant effect. AOB community structure was analyzed by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) of the amoA gene, which encodes the α subunit of ammonia monooxygenase. DGGE profiles showed that the AOB community was more diverse in N-fertilized treatments than in the PK-fertilized treatment or the control, while one dominant band observed in the control could not be detected {{in any of the}} fertilized treatments. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the DGGE bands derived from N-fertilized treatments belonged to Nitrosospira cluster 3, indicating that N fertilization resulted in the dominance of Nitrosospira cluster 3 in soil.

To broaden our knowledge, high-throughput pyrosequencing and quantitative PCR were used to explore the impacts of inorganic fertilizer and manure on bacterial community composition in a 35 -year field experiment of Chinese Mollisols. Soils were collected from four treatments: no fertilizer (CK), inorganic phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) <b>fertilizer</b> (<b>PK),</b> inorganic P, K, and N fertilizer (NPK), and inorganic P and K fertilizer plus manure (MPK). All fertilization differently changed soil properties. Compared with CK, the PK and NPK treatments acidified soil by significantly decreasing soil pH from 6.48 to 5.53 and 6.16, respectively, while MPK application showed no significant differences of soil pH, indicating alleviation of soil acidification. Moreover, all fertilization significantly increased soil organic matter (OM) and soybean yields, with the highest observed under MPK regime. In addition, the community composition at each taxonomic level varied considerably among the fertilization strategies. Bacterial taxa, associated with plant growth promotion, OM accumulation, disease suppression, and increased soil enzyme activity, were overrepresented in the MPK regime, while they were present at low abundant levels under NPK treatment, i.e. phyla Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, class Alphaproteobacteria, and genera Variovorax, Chthoniobacter, Massilia, Lysobacter, Catelliglobosispora and Steroidobacter.

Foliar and cone dry mass increased after NP or NPK fertilizer application, the dry mass of living branches increased after NPK fertilizer and the dry mass of dead branches decreased after <b>PK</b> or NPK <b>fertilizer.</b> The total dry mass accumulation was not affected. Trees in a control plot (no fertilizer) took up the following nutrient amounts annually from the soil (kg/ha) : N 15. 6, Ca 12. 8, K 4. 1, P 1. 3, Mg 1. 7, S 1. 5 and Mn 1. 5. The annual uptake of Fe, Zn, Cu and B was 510, 130, 70 and 50 g/ha, respectively. More than 50 % of the nutrient uptake (except K and Fe) was released in litterfall. Fertilized stands accumulated more N, P, K and B. Fertilizer application inhibited the uptake of Mn and Ca...|$|R
40|$|P-fertilizer {{other than}} {{chemical}} fertilizers {{has been used}} extensively in agriculture. However, {{the extent to which}} P-fertilizer contributes to the growth of plants has only been discussed a few, meanwhile the information will be very helpful to the use of P-fertilizer efficiently. The 32 P method was used to distinguish P contribution from several sources, i. e soil, chemical fertilizer (Sp) and manure/organic <b>fertilizer</b> (<b>Pk).</b> The isotope carrier free solution of KH 232 PO 4, which is contained of 98 % 32 P, was applied to the soil and thus making it as the only source of labeled-P. Radioactivity counting of soil samples will lead to the measurement of P-contribution from several sources of P given. The experiment result showed that most of the P taken up by the plants was from soil. Thus, the P from Sp (P-Sp) and Pk (P-Pk) became un-significantly support the plant growth expressed in lesser dry weight of straw, grain and plants compared to those who taken its P from soil. Although soil contributed most of its available P to straw and grain of lowland rice, but Sp and Pk still contributed P to both plant parts. It was obtained that in straw 64 – 82 % P was derived from soil; 12 – 21 % P was derived from Pk; and 18 – 29 % P was derived from Sp. For grain 49 – 89 % P was derived from soil; 11 – 15 % P was derived from Pk; and 19 – 45 % P was derived from Sp. Received: 20 November 2009; Revised: 09 August 2010; Accepted: 23 August 201...|$|R
40|$|The {{conversion}} of virgin desert into oasis farmland creates two contrasting types of land-cover. During oasis formation with irrigation and fertilizer application, however, {{the changes in}} the soil microbial population, which play critical roles in the ecosystem, remain poorly understood. We applied high-throughput pyrosequencing to investigate bacterial and archaeal communities throughout the profile (0 - 3 m) in an experimental field, where irrigation and fertilization began in 1990 and cropped with winter wheat since then. To assess the effects of cultivation, the following treatments were compared with the virgin desert: CK (no <b>fertilizer),</b> <b>PK,</b> NK, NP, NPK, NPKR, and NPKM (R: straw residue; M: manure fertilizer). Irrigation had a greater impact on the overall microbial community than fertilizer application. The greatest impact occurred in topsoil (0 - 0. 2 m), e. g., Cyanobacteria (25 % total abundance) were most abundant in desert soil, while Actinobacteria (26 %) were most abundant in oasis soil. The proportions of extremophilic and photosynthetic groups (e. g., Deinococcus-Thermus and Cyanobacteria) decreased, while the proportions of R-strategy (e. g., Gammaproteobacteria including Xanthomonadales), nitrifying (e. g., Nitrospirae), and anaerobic bacteria (e. g., Anaerolineae) increased throughout the oasis profile. Archaea occurred only in oasis soil. The impact of fertilizer application was mainly reflected in the non-dominant communities or finer taxonomic divisions. Oasis formation led to a dramatic shift in microbial community and enhanced soil enzyme activities. The rapidly increased soil moisture and decreased salt caused by irrigation were responsible for this shift. Furthermore, difference in fertilization and crop growth altered the organic carbon contents in the soil, which resulted in differences of microbial communities within oasis...|$|R
