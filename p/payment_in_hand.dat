He began with handbills advertising Mackintosh's Celebrated Toffee as a weekend treat targeting the Saturday afternoon market, when workers had a half-holiday and their weekly wage <b>payment</b> <b>in</b> <b>hand.</b> [...] By 1896, Mackintosh was calling himself the [...] "Toffee King" [...] and his product [...] "The King of All the Toffees". [...] In 1902 the firm began consumer and coupon competitions and then national press marketing: the firm bought space in the Daily Mail, Britain's most popular mass newspaper, and it used story lines, graphics and cartoons, while his competitors still limited themselves to wordy descriptions.|$|E
40|$|The 1996 Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act (FAIR) {{contained}} important breaks with {{a tradition}} of crop-by-crop subsidies {{dating back to the}} Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933. Farmers with recorded base acres were given the opportunity (which nearly all accepted) to sign a seven-year `contract' with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), under which payments will be continued on the merged base acres on a declining schedule until the year 2002. FAIR is an unfinished agenda. First, the coverage of `freedom to farm' is only partial, with numerous commodities left out of the decoupling programme. Second, the largest producers will augment their already significant receipts with generous lump sum transfers from USDA. This will further reinforce the concentration of roughly 90 per cent of receipts and <b>payments</b> <b>in</b> the <b>hands</b> of the 100 000 to 200 000 largest producers of field crops. An alternative would be to make <b>payments</b> <b>in</b> times of low marketing receipts which recede when prices are high. Agricultural and Food Policy,...|$|R

The tenants of a given estate agreed with one another what abatement they thought just in the current half-year’s rent. This in a body they proffered to landlord or agent. If it was refused as <b>payment</b> <b>in</b> full, they <b>handed</b> the money to a managing committee, and the committee deposited it with some person in whom they had confidence, to be used for the purpose of the struggle.(225) That such proceeding constituted an unlawful conspiracy nobody doubts, any more than it can be doubted that before the Act of 1875 every trade combination of a like kind in this island was a conspiracy.|$|R
40|$|In the {{developing}} world, {{having access to}} a toilet does not necessarily imply use: infrequent or non-use limits the desired health outcomes of improved sanitation. We examine the sanitation situation in a rural part of South Africa where recipients of novel, waterless “urine-diverting dry toilets” are not regularly using them. In order to determine if small, conditional cash transfers (CCT) could motivate families to use their toilets more, we paid for urine via different incentive-based interventions: two were based on volumetric pricing and the third was a flat-rate payment (irrespective of volume). A flat-rate payment (approx. € 1) resulted in {{the highest rates of}} regular (weekly) participation at 59 %. The low volumetric payment (approx. € 0. 05 /L) led to regular participation rates of only 12 % and no increase in toilet use. The high volumetric payment (approx. € 0. 1 /L) resulted in lower rates of regular participation (35 %), but increased the average urine production per household per day by 74 %. As a first example of conditional cash transfers being used in the sanitation sector, we show that they are an accepted and effective tool for increasing toilet use, while putting small cash <b>payments</b> <b>in</b> the <b>hands</b> of poor, largely unemployed populations in rural South Africa...|$|R

40|$|The {{organization}} of the creative (arts and entertainment) industries rests on many types of contracts. These contracts govern collaborations between artists and other parties - at arm's length, or within an enterprise. These contracts' structures devolve from a few bedrock properties of creative work and creative products. Artists invest in developing their talents, presenting themselves before `gatekeepers' who seek talents that can profitably be developed and marketed. Gatekeepers commonly function as agents for selecting artists and as match-makers between artists and complementary inputs. As {{an extension of the}} gatekeeping function, the participants in creative industries take part in a continuous ranking process that sets and revises the ranks of vertically differentiated talents. Real option contracts pervasively govern the sequential steps of developing a creative product. These can leave the artist an autonomous creative agent (pop musicians and record labels) or enclose artists' talents in an employment relationship (classic Hollywood studios). The transformation of the movie industry to `flexible specialization' illustrates how changing basic conditions can transform the dominant form of organization. The scales of enterprise in the creative industries tend to be driven by the efficient scales with which creative goods are distributed (very large for record labels and movie studios, small for art galleries), and they tend to assort themselves into those focused on the distribution of creative goods (`promoters') and those concerned with identifying and nurturing creative talents (`pickers'). Large enterprises also include the `entertainment conglomerates' which seek synergistic gains that depend theoretically on quite special conditions; foreclosure and its avoidance may be principal motives. Non-profit enterprises dominate a number of arts activities, apparently for two interrelated reasons. These activities incur high fixed but low marginal costs, pressing them to employ two-part prices and club arrangements to ensure fixed costs' coverage. When product quality is endogenous, however, non-profit status may be necessary for the manager credibly to foreswear degrading quality once the fixed <b>payment</b> is <b>in</b> <b>hand.</b> Non-profits supported by donation streams thus enjoy functional advantages. ...|$|R

Using <b>payments</b> <b>in</b> kind as an example, this paper examines why and how firms engage in such 'irrational' behavior. In-kind <b>payments</b> (<b>payments</b> made <b>in</b> terms of consumer goods) {{used to be an}} important aspect of urban life in China - 68 % of our sample workers received <b>payments</b> <b>in</b> kind in 1988. The ratio declined to only 10 % in 1999. In explaining the prevalence of in-kind <b>payment</b> <b>in</b> the 1980 s and the subsequent decline in the 1990 s, two hypotheses are proposed. The first is the lack of access to consumer goods by individuals. The second is to evade the control on wage bills imposed by the government. Empirical evidence from an urban household survey is consistent with the second hypothesis. The results imply that the introduction of a hard budget constraint is essential to ensure the rational behavior of public enterprises in setting their wage <b>payments.</b> <b>Payment</b> <b>In</b> Kind, Chinese Collective And State-owned Enterprises, Government Control, Budget Constraints, Rational Behavior,...|$|R
