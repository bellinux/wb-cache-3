5|$|Draught camel {{are used}} for several {{purposes}} including <b>ploughing,</b> processing in oil mills and pulling carts. There is no clear description for the ideal draught camel, though its strength, its ability to survive without water and the flatness of its feet could be indicators. It {{may be used for}} <b>ploughing</b> in pairs or in groups with buffaloes or bullocks. The draught camel can plough at around , and should not be used for more than six hours a day four hours in the morning and two in the afternoon. The camel is not easily exhausted unless diseased or undernourished, and has remarkable endurance and hardiness.|$|E
5|$|Most farming {{was based}} on the lowland fermtoun or Highland baile, {{settlements}} of a handful of families that jointly farmed an area notionally suitable for two or three plough teams, allocated in run rigs to tenant farmers. They usually ran downhill so that they included both wet and dry land, helping to offset some of the problems of extreme weather conditions. Most <b>ploughing</b> was done with a heavy wooden plough with an iron coulter, pulled by oxen, which were more effective in heavy soils and cheaper to feed than horses. Obligations to the local lord usually included supplying oxen for <b>ploughing</b> the lord's land on an annual basis and the much resented obligation to grind corn at the lord's mill.|$|E
5|$|Some {{grasshopper}} species, {{like the}} Chinese rice grasshopper, are a pest in rice paddies. <b>Ploughing</b> exposes the eggs {{on the surface}} of the field, to be destroyed by sunshine or eaten by natural enemies. Some eggs may be buried too deeply in the soil for hatching to take place.|$|E
50|$|<b>Plough</b> Monday is the {{traditional}} start of the English agricultural year. While local practices may vary, <b>Plough</b> Monday is generally the first Monday after Twelfth Day (Epiphany), 6 January. References to <b>Plough</b> Monday {{date back to the}} late 15th century. The day before <b>Plough</b> Monday is sometimes referred to as <b>Plough</b> Sunday.|$|R

5|$|Exmoor {{also has}} a henge located near to Parracombe, {{although}} it has been damaged by <b>ploughing.</b> Alongside this, the moor bears a profusion of other Bronze Age monuments, including between 300 and 400 round barrows, standing stones, and linear stone settings. The creation of these different monument types might explain why so few stone circles were apparently created here.|$|E

5|$|Improvement {{continued}} in the nineteenth century. Innovations included the first working reaping machine, developed by Patrick Bell in 1828. His rival James Smith turned to improving sub-soil drainage and developed a method of <b>ploughing</b> that could break up the subsoil barrier without disturbing the topsoil. Previously unworkable low-lying carselands could now be brought into arable production {{and the result was}} the even Lowland landscape that still predominates.|$|E
5|$|In many ways, {{life for}} peasants in the {{countryside}} during the Song dynasty was similar to those living in previous dynasties. The people spent their days <b>ploughing</b> and planting in the fields, tending to their families, selling crops and goods at local markets, visiting local temples, and arranging ceremonies such as marriages. Cases of banditry, which local officials were forced to combat, occurred constantly {{in the countryside}}.|$|E
5|$|Natural England's role is {{to advise}} and help the owners manage Whitton Bridge Pasture effectively. To achieve this Natural England {{provides}} guidelines for each SSSI. Species-rich grassland, such as that found at Whitton Bridge, requires careful management for it to retain its high species diversity. This means many activities are not allowed at the site including: <b>ploughing,</b> drainage {{and the use of}} fertilisers, pesticides or herbicides.|$|E

5|$|On the upland farms of Wales, Welsh ponies and cobs {{would often}} have to do {{everything}} from <b>ploughing</b> a field to carrying a farmer to market or driving a family to services on Sunday.

5|$|Scholars have {{proposed}} {{theories about the}} etymology {{the name of the}} goddess, connections to fertility and <b>ploughing</b> practices, the implications of the references made to her as a virgin, five potential mentions of the goddess in the Old English poem Beowulf, and potential connections between Gefjon and Grendel's Mother and/or the goddesses Freyja and Frigg.|$|E
5|$|The Atharvaveda credits {{him of the}} {{invention}} of <b>ploughing</b> and thus, agriculture. He is also described as one who flattened the Earth's rocky surface, thus encouraging agriculture, cattle-breeding, commerce and development of new cities on earth.

Patil suggests that the Rigvedic Prithu was a vegetarian deity, associated with Greek god Dionysus and another Vedic god Soma.|$|E

5|$|The Somerset {{section is}} largely dry and is {{gradually}} {{disappearing into the}} landscape, {{as a result of}} roads improvements and <b>ploughing,</b> but a footpath has been established along much of its route, and archaeological excavations of the lift at Nynehead, the only one where there are still substantial remains, were carried out between 1998 and 2003 by the Somerset Industrial Archaeological Society.|$|E
5|$|The {{conventional}} {{approach was}} probably {{the first to be}} employed, since it is comparatively easy to destroy weeds by burning them or <b>ploughing</b> them under, and to kill larger competing herbivores. Techniques such as crop rotation, companion planting (also known as intercropping or mixed cropping), and the selective breeding of pest-resistant cultivars have a long history.|$|E
