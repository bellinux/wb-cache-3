50|$|In these studies, data on {{childhood}} vaccinations {{were typically}} collected in periodic surveys, {{and the information}} on vaccinations, which occurred between successive home visits, was updated {{at the time of}} the second visit. The <b>person-time</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> in unvaccinated and vaccinated states was then divided up according to the date of vaccination during the time interval between visits. This method opens up a potential bias, insofar as the updating of person time at risk from unvaccinated to vaccinated is only possible for children who survive to the second follow-up. Those who die between visits typically do not have vaccinations between the first visit and death recorded, and thus they will tend to be allocated as deaths in unvaccinated children - thus incorrectly inflating the mortality rate among unvaccinated children.|$|E
40|$|Background: Numerators and denominators used to {{estimate}} infec-tions ’ incidence rates (IRs), incidence rate ratios (IRRs), and differ-ences (IRDs) vary. Our objective is to quantify the impact of various common definitions for illness episodes (numerators) and <b>person-time</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> (denominators) in estimating these measures. Methods: Data were from a cohort study in which daily occurrence of illness and children’s attendance in day care centers were re-corded. We compared 4 IR estimates using various definitions of episode and at-risk time units. Results: IRs for diarrhea and colds were highest using child-days, lowest for diarrhea using child-weeks, and lowest for colds using child-months. The 4 methods led to similar IRRs but considerably different IRDs. Conclusion: Incidence rate differences and ratios for infectious diseases can vary by the definition of episode and <b>person-time</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk.</b> This limits {{the value of the}} evidence base on which public health recommendations are formulated. Development of a more standard approach to measurement and reporting of IRs is recommended. Public health questions have been raised about the in-creased incidence rates (IRs) of diarrhea and respiratory infections in day care settings. 1 – 7 However, the numerators and denominators used in estimating IRs and incidence rate ratios (IRRs) or incidence rate differences (IRDs) vary con-siderably. Numerators (ie, numbers of new illness episodes) are defined in terms of symptoms, duration and a lag period between independent episodes. Lag periods are not standard-ized (Table 1). Denominators (ie, total <b>person-time</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk),</b> vary by both the unit of time used and lag period. Our objective is to quantify the impact of commonly used definitions for numerators and denominators in estimat-ing the incidence rates of diarrhea and colds in children attending day care centers and to evaluate the impact of these definitions on IRRs and IRDs...|$|E
50|$|The {{incidence}} rate {{is the number}} of new cases per population <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> in a given time period. When the denominator is the sum of the <b>person-time</b> of the <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> population, it is also known as the incidence density rate or person-time {{incidence rate}}. In the same example as above, the incidence rate is 14 cases per 1000 person-years, because the incidence proportion (28 per 1,000) is divided by the number of years (two). Using person-time rather than just time handles situations where the amount of observation time differs between people, or when the population <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> varies with time. Use of this measure implies the assumption that the incidence rate is constant over different periods of time, such that for an incidence rate of 14 per 1000 persons-years, 14 cases would be expected for 1000 persons observed for 1 year or 50 persons observed for 20 years.|$|R

Poisson regression analysis of the mortality trend over 26 years allowed the potential limitation of a relatively short pre-screening period to be overcome. Indeed, the comparison of the SCD trend between screened athletes and unscreened nonathletes (i. e., a control population of the same age from the same geographic area) during the same study period provided compelling evidence of the selective decrease in mortality in young athletes undergoing screening. Although the authors' aim to explain the trend of SCDs in Israel athletes is laudable, their conclusion that the mortality rate in young athletes cannot be changed by implementing pre-participation screening is not supported by scientifically reliable data...|$|E

40|$|In general, poverty {{measures}} are estimated by applying income information. However, only using income data for calculating relative poverty {{might lead to}} an incomplete view. For example, a household can be under a poverty threshold even if a household member owns real estate or equity. In this thesis, <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of income poverty in Germany is estimated. In {{order to get a}} more complete picture of <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of poverty, a multidimensional approach is applied. Not only <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of income poverty, also <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of wealth poverty is measured. Moreover, households that are both <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of income and wealth poor are analyzed. Furthermore, several poverty groups are identified: twice-poor which are households that are, <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of income and wealth poverty; protected-poor, households that are <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of income poverty but not <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of wealth poverty; vulnerable-poor, households which are <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of wealth poverty but not <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of income poverty; non-poor, households which are either <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of income poverty nor <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of wealth poverty. Poverty profiles in Germany and their changes over time are analyzed for the years 2002, 2007 and 2012. In fact, it is investigated to which degree <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of poverty rates differ in socio-economic characteristics. A logit regression is applied for each dimension and each wave for estimation. For robustness checks, 95 percent bootstrap confidence intervals are calculated for all results. Findings suggest that young age, region East Germany, single, lone parent, unemployment and low education are factors that condition the <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of poverty rates.

40|$|SETTING: Correctional {{settings}} and remand prisons. OBJECTIVE: To critically discuss calculations for epidemiological {{indicators of the}} tuberculosis (TB) burden in prisons and to provide recommendations to improve study comparability. METHODS: A hypothetical data set illustrates issues in determining incidence and prevalence. The appropriate calculation of the incidence rate is presented and problems arising from cross-sectional surveys are clarifi ed. RESULTS: Cases recognized during the fi rst 3 months should be classifi ed as prevalent at entry and excluded from any incidence rate calculation. The numerator for the incidence rate includes persons detected as having developed TB during a specifi ed period of time subsequent to the initial 3 months. The denominator is persontime at risk from 3 months onward to the end point (TB or end of the observation period). Preferably, entry time, exit time and event time are known for each inmate to determine <b>person-time</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk.</b> Failing that, an approximation consists of the sum of monthly head counts, excluding prevalent cases and those persons no longer at risk from both the numerator and the denominator.

40|$|Several {{risk factors}} for sudden infant death {{syndrome}} (SIDS) have been consistently reported, while results regarding seasonally and age at death of SIDS victims are conflicting. In the present population-based cohort study, single births in Sweden from 1983 through 1990 were used to estimate the relative and absolute risks for SIDS associated with season at death, age at death, and maternal smoking. In the winter period, 283 SIDS deaths occurred, while only 98 infants died during summer (winter/summer ratio = 2. 9). Taking <b>person-time</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> into account and restricting the analysis to infants aged 7 - 180 days, the authors determined the relative risk for SIDS to be 3. 5 times higher in winter than in summer. When comparing incidence rate differences, they found a more noticeable seasonal variation for early SIDS (7 - 90 days at death) than for late SIDS (91 - 180 days at death). For early SIDS, the incidence rate was 0. 6 cases per 100, 000 person-days higher among smokers than among nonsmokers; for late SIDS, the corresponding difference was 0. 3. The effect of smoking on SIDS was not associated with seasonality. Since exposure to passive smoking is likely to vary by season, the results suggest that the effect of smoking on SIDS is prenatal rather than the result of passive smoking after birth.

40|$|Abstract: Ecosystems <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> {{experience}} the same threats to their existence as species <b>at</b> <b>risk,</b> including ecosystem loss, degradation, alien species invasion, and climate change. Although ecosystems <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> often provide habitat for species <b>at</b> <b>risk,</b> {{many do not}} necessarily support designated species <b>at</b> <b>risk.</b> Certain ecosystems <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> probably contain species <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> from species groups {{that have not been}} well studied, such as invertebrates and lichens. Many of the ecosystems <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> are quite small and are often communities such as shrub steppe, woodland, riparian, or wetlands. Natural Heritage Programs and Conservation Data Centres throughout North America are tracking ecosystems at risk; however, there are few jurisdictions that protect these ecosystems through legislation even though they are a critical element of biological diversity. This paper takes a comprehensive view of ecosystems, which can include broader systems within an ecoregional level down to smaller ecosystems (such as vernal pools or seeps on rocky outcrops) that may not be well covered by existing plant community classification. Legislation for ecosystems <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> is believed to be in effect in only two states in the United States, whereas in Canada, only one jurisdiction has a minimal form of protection for these ecosystems. This paper recommends steps that should be taken to ensure that ecosystems <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> are treated equally to species <b>at</b> <b>risk,</b> and that they are not forgotten when conservation of biological diversity is considered. These recommendations focus on the need for providing protection by legislation or other means, the need for recovery planning for ecosystems <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> that become listed, and the inclusion of aquatic and marine ecosystems <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> in tracking and conservation efforts...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Secondary {{hyperparathyroidism}} (SHPT) {{is associated}} with mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), but the economic consequences of SHPT have not been adequately studied in the European population. We assessed the relationship between SHPT parameters (intact parathyroid hormone [iPTH], calcium, and phosphate) and hospitalisations, medication use, and associated costs among CKD patients in Europe. Methods The analysis of {{this retrospective cohort study}} used records of randomly selected patients who underwent haemodialysis between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2006 at participating European Fresenius Medical Care facilities in 10 countries. Patients had ≥ 1 iPTH value recorded, and ≥ 1 month of follow-up after a 3 -month baseline period during which SHPT parameters were assessed. Time at risk was post-baseline until death, successful renal transplantation, loss to follow-up, or the end of follow-up. Outcomes included cost per patient-month, rates of hospitalisations (cardiovascular disease [CVD], fractures, and parathyroidectomy [PTX]), and use of SHPT-, diabetes-, and CVD-related medications. National costs were applied to hospitalisations and medication use. Generalised linear models compared costs across strata of iPTH, total calcium, and phosphate, adjusting for baseline covariates. Results There were 6369 patients included in the analysis. Mean ± SD <b>person-time</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> was 13. 1 ± 6. 4 months. Patients with iPTH > 600 pg/mL had a higher hospitalisation rate than those with lower iPTH. Hospitalisation rates varied little across calcium and phosphate levels. SHPT-related medication use varied with iPTH, calcium, and phosphate. After adjusting for demographic and clinical variables, patients with baseline iPTH > 600 pg/mL had 41 % (95 % CI: 25 %, 59 %) higher monthly total healthcare costs compared with those with iPTH in the K/DOQI target range (150 – 300 pg/mL). Patients with baseline phosphate and total calcium levels above target ranges (1. 13 – 1. 78 mmol/L and 2. 10 – 2. 37 mmol/L, respectively) had 38 % (95 % CI: 27 %, 50 %) and 8 % (95 % CI: 0 %, 17 %) higher adjusted monthly costs, respectively. Adjusted costs were 25 % (95 % CI: 18 %, 32 %) lower among patients with baseline phosphate levels below the target range. Results were consistent in sensitivity analyses. Conclusions These data suggest that elevated SHPT parameters increase the economic burden of CKD in Europe. </p...|$|E

Until now, it is unclear whether CAP in COPD is due to smoking-related effects, or due to COPD pathophysiology itself. Objective: To evaluate the association between COPD and CAP by smoking status. Methods: In total, 62, 621 COPD and 191, 654 control subjects, matched by year of birth, gender and primary care practice, were extracted from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (2005 – 2014). Incidence rates (IRs) were estimated by dividing the total number of CAP cases by the cumulative <b>person-time</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk.</b> Time-varying Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) for CAP in COPD patients versus controls. HRs of CAP by smoking status were calculated by stratified analyses in COPD patients versus controls and within both subgroups with never smoking as reference. Results: IRs of CAP in COPD patients (32. 00 / 1, 000 person-years) and controls (6. 75 / 1, 000 person-years) increased with age and female gender. The risk of CAP in COPD patients was higher than in controls (HR 4. 51, 95 % CI: 4. 27 – 4. 77). Current smoking COPD patients had comparable CAP risk (HR 0. 92, 95 % CI: 0. 82 – 1. 02) as never smoking COPD patients (reference), whereas current smoking controls had a higher risk (HR 1. 23, 95 % CI: 1. 13 – 1. 34) compared to never smoking controls. Conclusion: COPD patients have a fourfold increased risk to develop CAP, independent of smoking status. Identification of factors related with the increased risk of CAP in COPD is warranted, in order to improve the management of patients at risk.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} children <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> for hearing and/or language {{disorders and}} {{to investigate the}} association between these risks by conducting pre-validated hearing and language screenings. METHODS: The study was conducted during a polio vaccination campaign in August of 2013 in basic health units in western São Paulo. Parents of children between 2 and 5 years of age {{were asked to complete}} two screening tools: a hearing questionnaire (regarding hearing development) and a language production and comprehension scale (including the major language development milestones). The screening tools were administered by different researchers. We compared the risk of having language disorders among children <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> for hearing loss versus children not <b>at</b> <b>risk,</b> as well as the attributable risk and odds ratios. Chi-squared tests and logistic regression analyses were used. RESULTS: The study included 479 children {{with a mean age of}} three and one-half years, of whom 26. 9 % were identified as <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> for deficits in language production, 8. 6 % were <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> for deficits in language comprehension and 14 % were <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> for hearing disorders. The children <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> for hearing disorders were twice as likely as those not <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> to exhibit language production and comprehension deficits. CONCLUSION: The results of this study highlight the importance of establishing and adopting low-cost procedures such as screenings to identify children <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of developing language and/or hearing disorders in early childhood...|$|R
