50|$|The first tunnel (the more {{northern}} of the uptown pair) {{was originally}} built without an excavation shield or iron construction because {{the chief engineer}} of the time, Dewitt Haskin, believed that the river silt {{was strong enough to}} maintain the tunnel's form (with the help of compressed air) until a 2 ft brick lining could be constructed. Haskin's plan was to excavate the tunnel, then fill it with compressed air to expel the water and to hold the iron <b>plate</b> <b>lining</b> in place. They succeeded in building the tunnel out by approximately 1200 ft from Jersey City until a series of blowouts—including a particularly serious one in 1880 that took the lives of 20 workers—ended the project.When the New York & Jersey Tunnel Company resumed construction on the tunnels in 1902, chief engineer Charles M. Jacobs employed a different method of tunneling using tubular cast iron plating. An enormous mechanical shield was pushed through the silt {{at the bottom of the}} river. The displaced mud was then placed into a chamber, where it was later shoveled into small cars that hauled it to the surface. In some cases, the silt was baked with kerosene torches to facilitate easier removal of the mud. The southern tunnel of the uptown pair was constructed using the tubular cast iron method. Construction of the uptown tunnels was completed in 1906. A second pair of tunnels was built about 1+1/4 mi south of the first pair. Construction began in 1906 and was completed in 1909, also using the tubular cast iron method.|$|E

40|$|This senior {{project is}} a {{facilities}} design for the plate production room at Hardy Diagnostics. This project was completed using a systematic layout planning approach. The main reason for this redesign was to consolidate all <b>plate</b> <b>line</b> production into one room. This would ensure better visability for the managers. After the project was defined, the different departments were established and the relationships between those departments were found. The space requirements needed for those departments were then measured out to also include the aisle widths and any machinery or carts needed to complete each function. Having determined all requirements for this facility, three layouts were generated. The first layout is called the horizontal layout because of the direction {{of all of the}} <b>plate</b> <b>lines.</b> The second is called the vertical layout because all the <b>plate</b> <b>lines</b> are positioned vertically. The last is called the modified vertical layout because it is similar to the vertical layout with modifications on the <b>plate</b> <b>line</b> locations. After evaluating each layout, the modified vertical layout was chosen. The implementation costs about $ 3, 880. 00 with a payback period of approximately 3 years...|$|R
40|$|We have {{localised}} the placental endothelial marker caveolin- 1 at the ultrastructural level using indirect immunogold labelling. The particulate label {{has been}} quantified {{to assess the}} distribution of the target protein within term placental chorionic villi. The mesodermal compartment of the tissue was more heavily labelled than the ectodermally derived trophoblast. Basal <b>plate</b> <b>lining</b> endothelium, and villous endothelium had similar immunoreactivity with anti-caveolin- 1 antibody. A polarised distribution of the caveolin within chorionic villous capillary endothelial cells was observed. As evidenced by immuno-reactivity, the protein was statistically significantly more concentrated in the region associated with the basal membrane than the apical membrane. The latter region contained in turn significantly more anticaveolin- 1 immunoreactivity than the central region. These differences are discussed in the light of possible transport and signalling platform roles for villous and basal plate endothelium. (c) 2006 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{provides}} an overview of pollution prevention techniques that apply to <b>plating</b> <b>lines</b> within metal finishing operations. As described in Overview of the Metal Finishing Industry, the <b>plating</b> <b>line</b> is the part of the metal finishing process where metal is applied to a substrate. The first section of this chapter describes general pollution prevention techniques for plating solutions and covers housekeeping, monitoring, additives, equipment modification, and on-site recycling and recovery. The next section covers general issues in pollution prevention for cyanide-based plating. The next seven sections cover pollution prevention options for plating specific metals such as brass, cadmium, chromium, copper, nickel, precious metals, and zinc. The sections that follow cover additional types of plating including electroless, aluminum, chemical and electrical conversion, and others. General Pollution Prevention Techniques for Plating Solutions Common Pollution Prevention Practices presented a number of general pollution prevention techniques for all types of metal finishing operations. These general techniques can apply in a variety ways to <b>plating</b> <b>lines.</b> The following are some specific applications of these techniques to plating baths...|$|R

40|$|The {{highest risk}} to {{encounter}} wake vortices prevails in ground proximity, where the vortices cannot descend below the glide path but tend to rebound {{due to the}} interaction with the ground surface. Weak crosswinds may compensate the self-induced lateral propagation of the upwind vortex, such that it may hover over the runway directly in the flight path of the following aircraft. With the installation of <b>plate</b> <b>lines</b> at distances {{of a few hundred}} meters from the runway threshold, vortex decay in ground proximity can be substantially accelerated. A new hybrid simulation method is employed to capture wake vortex evolution in ground proximity from early roll-up to final decay. The numerical simulations reveal the nature of the disturbances triggered by the <b>plate</b> <b>line</b> and of so-called end effects driven by the sudden loss of lift during touchdown. Field measurement data gathered during the campaigns WakeMUC at Munich airport and WakeOP at special airport Oberpfaffenhofen corroborate and complement the findings of the simulations. Experiments and simulations demonstrate that <b>plate</b> <b>lines</b> appreciably accelerate wake vortex decay and interfere favorably with the end effects. This way safety can be further increased during the flight phase with most reported encounters...|$|R

40|$|Wake-vortex {{encounter}} {{reports as}} well as simulations show a significantly higher encounter probability during landing shortly before touchdown in comparison to other flight phases. This is caused, among other factors, by the special behavior of wake vortices in ground effect. Nevertheless, hazardous wake encounters with adverse consequences are rarely reported in reality. To gain more insight in the mechanisms of wake encounters close to ground, encounter simulations were performed with realistic vortex flowfields. These were generated using coupled Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes and large-eddy simulations covering the whole vortex evolution in ground effect from generation until decay and were used for a hazard analysis. Encounter simulations were performed with a simulation model of an A 320 -size aircraft with autopilot engaged following an A 340 -size aircraft. Different wind conditions and vortex ages were considered {{as well as}} a so-called <b>plate</b> <b>line.</b> Recent studies showed increased vortex decay when a series of plates is positioned in front of the runway threshold. The results of the study reveal a significant reduction of the maximal vortex impact on the encountering aircraft due to the <b>plate</b> <b>line.</b> This effect is more pronounced for younger vortices, but also for operationally relevant vortex ages, a considerable effect of the <b>plate</b> <b>lines</b> in reducing the maximum aircraft reaction due to a wake encounter close to ground can be observed...|$|R
