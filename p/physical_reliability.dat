40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is the {{generation}} of improved optimization approaches, applied to a volcanic modeling. Neither local nor global optimization algorithms can guarantee the generation of a global optimization solution. Furthermore, the generated models have to {{be integrated into the}} physical context of other available observations and models in the specific volcanic region. A reliable optimization result can only be given by a model with significant determined parameters which can be seen on small dispersion if the optimization is carried out several times as well as considering the results of statistical tests about the model fit. In addition, this model has to be validated by additional information from other observation techniques and models. Different improvements of the optimization have been analyzed within this thesis: (1) The first approach is given by the definition of physical constraints, which are implemented into the optimization approach by penalty terms. This approach shall lead to a decrease of possible solutions so the dispersion of the unknown parameters is decreased, which is equal to an increase of significance of these unknown parameters. (2) Another approach of improvement is given by the implementation of the results from a global sensitivity analysis. A re-weighting factor is implemented into the optimization approach, so the weight of the observations is varied with respect to their sensitivity against changes in a specific unknown parameter. (3) The last improvement approach is described by the implementation of a fuzzy logic model. This model fuses physical plausibility checks as well as available density data of the volcanic region. The fuzzy logic model results in a <b>physical</b> <b>reliability</b> value for the model. This approach is implemented actively into the optimization approach by an addend to the objective function. The generated models without any implementation improvements serve as reference. Data collected at the high risk volcano Merapi at Central Java, Indonesia serve as a case study. The modeling is based on a non-linear inversion of gravity changes and three-dimensional displacements which were measured between the years 2000 and 2002 at Merapi. The physical based mathematical model is described by the generalized static Navier equations which are solved for the mathematical half-space where elastic and gravitational effects are coupled. The parameters which have to be determined are given by the point mass of source, its position, and an energy value, described by the product of pressure and cubed radius. The different improvement approaches have been implemented into two different optimization algorithms: A downhill simplex and a genetic algorithm. The best optimization approach has been determined by comparing the different optimization configurations. The comparison results in the definition of a recommended optimization approach concerning the model's significance and <b>physical</b> <b>reliability.</b> The approach given by the implementation of the sensitivity analysis results into the genetic algorithm could determine the best elastic-gravitational source model concerning the dispersion of the unknown parameters and the fitness value of the result. Finally, the application of the fuzzy logic is used to validate these results with respect to the <b>physical</b> <b>reliability</b> of the elastic-gravitational source's position. So the quality of the model can be described statistically as well as physically. Nevertheless, all optimization configurations showed that a model which is solely based on a magmatic source is not feasible. All optimization results showed very shallow sources with small mass components and large energy values. These properties as well as the lack of ability to model the deformations lead to the assumption that another influence is acting. This effect is modelled by superposition of a local fault zone to the assumed magmatic source. This final model results in statistical significant and physical reliable parameters for a volcanic source superimposed with the effects of a fault zone. The model is statistically significant with a larger significance level than the models which are based on a solely elastic-gravitational source. In addition, this combined model also fits into the prior anticipations about the structure of Merapi given in the literature...|$|E

40|$|The {{increasingly}} competitive {{business environment}} has influenced contemporary organisations to build mutual beneficial {{relationships with their}} customers indicating a paradigm shift from transactional marketing. In order to compete in this intense competitive environment, organisations are creating competitive advantage over their rivals through service quality that will influence customer satisfaction which subsequently leads to customer loyalty. Service quality {{has been found to}} be the key strategy of success and survival for most organisations like retail supermarkets who want to win the loyalty of their customers because of its positive effect on customer satisfaction. The purpose of this research was to determine the relationship between service quality, customer satisfaction and customer loyalty in the retail supermarket industry. An empirical study was conducted in Grahamstown between two main supermarkets through a survey that determined customers’ perceptions on service quality, customer satisfaction and customer loyalty respectively. The empirical findings of this research study revealed that moderate to strong positive linear relationships exists between the dimensions of service quality (namely <b>physical</b> aspects, <b>reliability,</b> personal interaction, problem solving and policy) and customer satisfaction at the 5 % level of significance. Furthermore, this study showed that dimensions of service quality (namely <b>physical</b> aspects, <b>reliability,</b> personal interaction and problem solving) have weak negative linear relationships with price sensitivity dimension of customer loyalty. The study further showed that the dimensions of service quality (namely <b>physical</b> aspects, <b>reliability,</b> personal interaction, problem solving and policy) have weak to moderate positive linear relationships with the purchase intentions dimension of customer loyalty. In addition, all the dimensions of service quality (namely <b>physical</b> aspects, <b>reliability,</b> personal interaction, problem solving and policy) showed moderate positive linear relationships with word of mouth communication dimension of customer loyalty. A weak negative linear relationship between price sensitivity dimension of customer loyalty and customer satisfaction was revealed in this study. Purchase intentions dimension of customer loyalty was also found to have a moderate positive linear relationship with customer satisfaction. In addition, word of mouth communication dimension of customer loyalty showed a strong positive linear relationship with customer satisfaction. There is sufficient evidence that the customers of the two supermarkets in this study have different perceptions on problem solving dimension of service quality. This study further provides sufficient evidence of the significant difference between gender on the levels of customer satisfaction. In addition, this study showed that customers of various levels of education and occupations differ in price sensitivity dimension of customer loyalty. The average scores for word of mouth communication, purchase intentions and price sensitivity dimensions of customer loyalty were found to be significantly different between the two supermarkets investigated in this study. Therefore, for supermarkets to compete effectively in the intense retail supermarket industry in South Africa they have to manage their service quality dimensions so as to influence customer satisfaction and customer loyalty respectively...|$|R

40|$|Process {{systems are}} prone to {{accidents}} as they deal with hazardous material at high temperature and/or pressure. Process plants are also characterized as complex systems where a dense cluster of pipes and equipment may cause a chain of accidents. Therefore, implementation and maintenance of safety measures through risk assessment is crucial to maintain risk below the acceptance criteria. Risk assessment methodologies such as quantitative risk analysis (QRA) and probabilistic safety analysis (PSA) comprise different steps among which accident scenario analysis is a common task. Accident scenario analysis includes accident sequence modeling and associated consequence assessment. Among many techniques available to conduct accident scenario analysis, bow-tie (BT) and Bayesian network (BN) are the most popular. Both techniques are graphical methods illustrating an accident scenario completely and taking advantage of robust probabilistic reasoning engines. BT technique addresses causes and consequences of an accident scenario in a transparent manner that is readily tractable and communicable with stakeholders. However, it suffers limitations of being static and unable to model conditional dependencies. These limitations significantly reduce BT's efficacy to do dynamic risk analysis. In the present study, Bayesian updating and real-time monitoring of operational parameters {{in the form of}} <b>physical</b> <b>reliability</b> models are used to overcome these limitations. <b>Physical</b> <b>reliability</b> models provided the analyst with a deeper insight into the behavior of risk while Bayes' rule helps to capture variations over time and to learn from experiences. Bayesian network is an alternative technique to conventional methods such as fault tree and bow-tie, with ample potential in risk assessment and safety analysis. Mapping fault tree and bow-tie into Bayesian network, it is shown that how conditional dependencies, multi-state variables, common cause failures can be considered and most importantly, probability updating can be conducted. Advanced aspects of Bayesian networks such as object-oriented Bayesian networks (OOBN) and discrete-time Bayesian networks (DTBN) are examined in this study. The former decomposes a large network to sub-models with desired level of abstraction, facilitating the modeling and capturing of dependencies. The latter explicitly takes time into account to model sequential failures by means of dynamic gates. To improve the performance of DTBN, an innovative algorithm is introduced {{to reduce the size of}} probability tables. Further, two new relationships are developed for dynamic gates cold spare and sequential enforcing gates to make them compatible with most distribution functions. Applying Bayesian networks in the field of domino effects, both propagation pattern and probability of domino effect at different stages are calculated. In this study, the efficacy of BN in safety analysis and accident scenario modeling of a variety of applications such as loss of well control, risk-based design of safety systems and domino effect is examined...|$|E

Microarray experiments rely on several critical steps that may introduce error and uncertainty in analyses. These steps include mRNA sample extraction, amplification and labeling, hybridization, and scanning. In some cases this may be manifested as systematic spatial variation {{on the surface of}} microarray in which expression measurements within an individual array may vary as a function of geographic position on the array surface. Results We hypothesized that an index of the degree of spatiality of gene expression measurements associated with their physical geographic locations on an array could indicate the summary of the <b>physical</b> <b>reliability</b> of the microarray. We introduced a novel way to formulate this index using a statistical analysis tool. Our approach regressed gene expression intensity measurements on a polynomial response surface of the microarray's Cartesian coordinates. We demonstrated this method using a fixed model and presented results from real and simulated datasets. Conclusion We demonstrated the potential of such a quantitative metric for assessing the reliability of individual arrays. Moreover, we showed that this procedure can be incorporated into laboratory practice as a means to set quality control specifications and as a tool to determine whether an array has sufficient quality to be retained in terms of spatial correlation of gene expression measurements. </p...|$|E

In addition, banks need to create a product - an innovative product that can attract potential customers to join a client. Innovative products that this must also consider the positive qualities that can be sensed or acquired customers, because these qualities can provide the optimum in customer satisfaction. In addition, the bank can provide criticism and suggestion boxes are provided in place of the customer transaction, it is important to do by the parties to determine, the extent to which customers feel the service that consists of physical evidence dimension (tangibles), reliability (reliability), responsiveness (responsiveness), insurance (assurance) and attention (empathy) is given by the bank. The purpose of this research is to find and analyze the influence of the quality of services consisting of <b>physical</b> evidence (tangibles), <b>reliability</b> (reliability), responsiveness (responsiveness), insurance (assurance) and attention (empathy) simultaneously and partially on customer satisfaction in using services of rural banks (BPR) in Mojokerto Puriseger Sentosa.

40|$|Permit to {{a person}} to enter the {{restricted}} area at Ngurah Rai Airport which is called Airport Pas can be given {{in accordance with the}} duties and activities of a person at the airport. On permit service, there are disappointments and complaints of the Pas applicant that can still be found in the Pas service like duration of Pas completion and officer service at the time of application. The different perception and expectation of Pas applicant must remain in the regulation corridors and prioritize security at airports. The purpose of this research is assesing the quality of Pas service in the Airport Authority Region IV by using a SERVQUAL (Service Quality) model. The model is comparing the two main factors, namely real customer perception of the service that they received (Perceived Service) with the actual services expected/desirable (Expected Service) which consists of 5 (five) dimensions, those are Tangibles (<b>physical),</b> <b>Reliability,</b> Responsiveness, Assurance and Empathy (attention). By using these models, it is known that the quality of Pas service in the Airport Authority Region IV is still less than the expectations of the applicant and the most important dimension to enhance is Responsiveness. Gaps between perception and expectation as follows: Responsiveness (- 0, 2240), Assurance (- 0, 2171), Reliability (- 0, 2099), Tangibles (- 0, 1994), dan Empathy (- 0, 1373) ...|$|E
40|$|The <b>physical</b> <b>reliability</b> and {{foundations}} of the Hund-Hückel MO-LCAO model, in which a molecular orbital (MO) is represented as a linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO), are examined in light of ab initio self-consistent field (SCF) computations with bases of various sizes. It is shown that appropriate linear transformations of the basis make evident a substructure of the relevant ab initio matrices and vectors that justifies the physical assumptions on which the MO-LCAO model rests. The main conceptual aspects, viz. hydrogen-like atomic orbitals, hybrids, localized orbitals, give a coherent picture, and the numerical data show that the contributions to occupied orbital energies ignored in the MO-LCAO model are actually small enough to justify their neglect in chemical structure studies. The numerical parameter values can therefore be read quantitatively in the ab initio results {{and the importance of}} the approximations made estimated. These conclusions have been drawn from studies on a variety of molecules with first- and second-row atoms. The well-established transferability of group properties in molecules suggests that they are generally valid. The claim that hybrids are method-independent, and therefore features of chemical reality at the orbital level, is discussed due to its relevance for comparisons of the stability of chemical bonds based on overlap. Of course, further work on questions such as electronegativities and promotion is needed. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|E
40|$|Artists in {{many areas}} of {{creative}} glass have used float glass due to its low cost, <b>physical</b> <b>reliability</b> and extensive sheet size. To date, the creative use of the coated insulating glass known as ‘low emissivity’ has not been explored. Pilkington K Glass is one of several coated low emissivity glasses developed in response to increasing energy conservation demands from the construction industry. The accidental use of a piece of Pilkington K Glass during studio artwork firing revealed an unexpected iridescent surface effect with unusual interferential colouration. To explore this creative potential, a full investigative programme was necessary. The research was undertaken {{from the perspective of a}} studio artist using a series of small scale tests leading to the making of artwork. This was an experimental approach driven by creative goals but also influenced and verified by procedures such as systematic analysis to determine repeatable criteria and microscopic examination to gain knowledge of the structure of the fired coating. Unusual effects of strong reflective colouration and iridescence were achieved through surface manipulation of K Glass by abrasion and subsequent firing at temperatures above 750 ºC. Manipulation by sandblasting and fusing with traditional float glass has enabled the development of an original method named the ‘Mirror Gap Technique’ which exhibited inter-layer interferential colouration from gold to purple. These methods and the adaptation of standard float glass procedures at temperatures above 750 ºC were then expanded into the creation of artworks to further develop innovative effects and applications. This project has developed and documented new possibilities that can be applied to several areas of creative glass. Exhibition and sale of the artwork as well as commissions involving multiple productions of conference gifts and company awards have indicated that low emissivity glass can be used creatively and that this research may have a commercial application. The research has been extended to examine other low emissivity coatings and provides the glass artist with an alternative palette of techniques and effects.
