40|$|Project {{was carried}} out at the Stock-raising Department of the Faculty of Stock-raising Technology of the Lithuanian Veterinary Academy. For the {{research}} the fermented cheese “Liliputas” was taken from UAB “Belvederio sūrinė” and the research {{was carried out}} in the laboratory of sensual analysis of the Nutrition Institute of Kaunas University of Technology. Project supervisor – Assoc. Prof. K. Pauliukas. Objective of the project is to adopt the production technology of the fermented cheese “Liliputas”, research the biochemical changes during the course of technological process, and determine the nutrition value. Research was carried out with the fermented cheese “Liliputas”, produced by UAB “Belvederio sūrinė”, by choosing the milk of the cowshed season and the milk of the <b>pasturable</b> season. Changes in the chemical composition and sensual indicators were researched in the laboratory of sensual analysis of the Nutrition Institute of Kaunas University of Technology. The following indicators were researched: pH, humidity (percentage), total nitrogen content (percentage), total protein content (percentage), total soluble nitrogen content (percentage), total soluble protein content (percentage), soluble non-protein nitrogen (percentage), free volatile fatty acids (VFA) NOOH ml, sensual properties (straw-color strength, elasticity when bending, solidity in mouth, viscosity (N), resiliency (mm), etc.). Maximum variation is observed with the free fatty acids when the cheese matures. Season did not have significant influence on the physical-chemical indicators. More intense straw-color strength as well as the smell of the fermented cheese is attributed to that cheese, which was produced during the <b>pasturable</b> season. Moreover, from the sensual properties we could observe that the cheese, produced during the <b>pasturable</b> season, was softer, more elastic, and a little bit more salty than the cheese, produced during the cowshed season. Cheese, produced during the <b>pasturable</b> season, was of the taste, more characteristic to the fermented cheese. After extra aging of the cheese, a slight difference according to the sensual indicators is observed {{under the influence of the}} season, however, it still remains. The most alterations of the indicators are observed during the periods of maturing. It is true to say that the most optimum period of maturing of the fermented cheese “Liliputas” is 2 months. Cheese, which has been matured for one month, is not mature enough. Whereas the maturing of the cheese for the period of 3 months did not have a major influence on the quality of the cheese...|$|E

In order to reduce the harmful effects of this contamination and to provide cost-effective and environmentally safe food production methods, we are forced to look for ways of reliable analysis of the environmental situation, the selection systems of animal husbandry and regulations for the degree of impact of pollutants on the elements of the agroecosystem. This article presents the results of studies aimed at assessing the plight of the environment of a large industrial centre, and its anthropogenic impacts on every element of the suburban ecosystems. It presents data on maintenance and migration of anthropogenous pollutants in the trophic chains of <b>pasturable</b> ecosystems of the suburb of Volgograd. The authors have listed the industrial enterprises as the key sources of pollution. The features of the distribution of xenobiotics in the tissues and organs of calves and heifers of different breeds were analysed in the study. Conclusions were drawn on the accumulation of heavy metals and arsenic in cattle, and the impact of this factor on the quality of production. A comparative assessment of the resistance of different breeds of cows to the action of toxicants in the environment of the Lower Volga region was carried out. Ways to decrease the impact of pollutants on the cattle organism have also been suggested.

Aim of {{the paper}} – to assess {{correlation}} of the quantity of urea, lactose and somatic cells in cows’ milk with non pregnancy period duration in Ltd Experimental Farm of Upytė. Objectives {{of the paper}}: to evaluate level of feeding cows of the farm. To estimate quantity of urea, lactose and somatic cells in cows’ milk during the period until insemination. To assess quantity of urea, lactose and somatic cells in cows’ milk, non pregnancy period duration and insemination index of different species and lactations cows. To assess correlation of the quantity of urea, lactose and somatic cells in cows’ milk with non pregnancy period duration. The research {{was carried out in}} district of Panevėžys - in Ltd Experimental Farm of Upytė. For the research were chosen cows of such species as Swedish with reddish brown spots, Lithuanian reddish brown and dairy Simmentals, which were calving in the period of 2008. 11. 01 – 2009. 01. 31. The level of feeding cows was analysed during the <b>pasturable</b> period and period in cow-house. Data of the milk composition and quality were recorded during the whole non pregancy period, but not longer than until 2009. 06. 30. More attention was paid to the number of somatic cells – thousands/ml, quantity of lactose – percents and urea mg percents, also to correlation of these indexes with non pregnancy period. Conclusions: 1. In Ltd Experimental Farm of Upytė feeding of dairy cows is well-balanced. 2. The best according to insemination index in farm are Lithuanian reddish brown and dairy Simmentals (insemination indexes 1, 7) and 5 and 6 lactation cows (1, 3; 1, 5), and cows of Simmentals species were more quickly inseminated (93 days) also 3; 4; 5 lactations cows respectively (94; 85; 78 days). 3. The composition of milk significantly changes and becomes worse, when cows are not inseminated until the 5 th month of lactation. Increases the number of somatic cells from 273 to 919 thousands/ml, decreases quantity of lactation in milk from 4, 79 to 4, 36 %, quantity of urea significantly changes just on the 7 th month of lactation. 4. Quantity of urea of the experimental group according to species is 13, 5 – 23 mg%, and from 1 to 6 lactation fluctuates from 10, 50 to 22, 5 mg%, that shows, that in respect of albumen the feeding ration of these cows is well-balanced. Just in particular cases quantity of nitrogen can be too low or quantity of energy can be too big. 5. Quantity of lactose according to species is 4, 36 – 4, 88 %, and from 1 to 6 lactation 4, 36 – 5, 01 %. In some cases concentration of lactose is lower, that is why can be stated that few cows can have mastitis or their ration is not fully balanced. However, most of cows according to this index are within the mark. 6. Quantity of somatic cells of the experimental group according to species is 104 – 1102 thousands/ml, and from 1 to 6 lactation – from 64 to 1168 thousands/ml. The number of somatic cells in this herd does not depend on the month of non pregnancy period, breed or lactation. This index shows that in farm quite a few cows have mastitis. 7. Connection between non pregnancy period duration and quantity of lactose according to species is different: LŽ (translator’s note: abbreviation of Lithuanian reddish brown) – weakly positive (0, 334), and SP (translator’s note: abbreviation of dairy Simmentals) – medium positive (0, 416). According to the number of lactations weakly positive connection was 1 and 3 lactations cows (0, 035; 0, 080), and strong positive – 6 (1). According to the number of insemination correlation was weakly positive, when cows were inseminated 1, 2 and 3 times (0, 071; 0, 014; 0, 231), other correlations were negative. 8. Correlation of non pregnancy period duration and the number of somatic cells of SP breed is weakly positive (0, 202), of other species - negative, of 1 and 3 lactations – weakly positive (0, 037 and 0, 242), and of 5 lactation is strong positive connection (0, 992). According to the number of insemination 1, 2 and 3 correlation of inseminations was weak (0, 011; 0, 013 and 0, 034) and other correlations were negative. 9. Correlation between non pregnancy period duration and quantity of urea according to species is: LŽ medium positive (0, 422), LŽ and SP weakly positive (0, 012; 0, 031). According to the number of lactations weak connection was of 1, 2 and 4 lactations (0, 375; 0, 161; 0, 359), and according 6 lactation strong positive (1). According to the number of inseminations was weak positive connection after 1, 2 and 4 inseminations (0, 049; 0, 201; 0, 254). In other cases correlation was negative...|$|E
