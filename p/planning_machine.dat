50|$|Lahey's Canungra Sawmill {{was again}} badly damaged by {{fire in the}} early hours of 13 January 1906. The main {{building}} which housed the sawing operations was completely destroyed. Up-to-date equipment recently imported from the United States of America was lost, including a broom handle machine, sand-papering machine and butter box printing machine. Several new additions to the mill operations, including a new drying kiln and <b>planning</b> <b>machine</b> shed were, however, saved. The fire forced the closure of the mill for three months.The rebuild following this fire was complemented by improvements between 1907 and 1908. Electric log-hauling machinery was installed. The tramway servicing the mill was extended over time and by 1910 the main line was 13½ km long with a branch 2 km up Flying Fox Creek and a sub-branch 500m up Little Flying Fox Creek to service a new aerial ropeway on Beech Mountain. Eventually, the total length of track laid amounted to 26½ km. Usage of the tramway continued to increase so that during 1915 alone, 15,000 tons of logs were being hauled to the mill along the tramway.In 1913, Tom Lahey left Australia on an inspection of milling operations in the United States of America. The Lahey's were interested in purchasing new milling machinery and keen to stay abreast of the latest trends in sawmilling practice. A range of new equipment was purchased, and once installed, the capacity of the mill doubled and the cost of labour greatly reduced. The introduction of an eight-foot band mill and steam log turner made the Lahey's Canungra Sawmill the biggest softwood mill in Queensland. In its heyday, the mill was producing Australia's largest output of softwood timber. In the process, the township of Canungra was established because of the presence and success of the mill.|$|E

40|$|There has {{recently}} been an increased emphasis on reducing energy consumption in manufacturing, driven by the fluctuations in energy costs and the growing importance given to environmental impact of manufactured goods. Lots of {{attention has been given}} to the reduction of machine tools energy consumption, as they require large amounts of energy to perform manufacturing tasks. One area that has received relatively little interest, yet could harness great potential, is reducing energy consumption by <b>planning</b> <b>machine</b> activities between manufacturing operations, while the machine is not in use. The intuitive option [...] which is currently exploited in manufacturing [...] is to leave the machine in a normal operating state in anticipation of the next manufacturing job. However, this is far from optimal due to the thermal deformation phenomenon, which usually require an energy-intensive warm-up cycle in order to bring all the components (e. g. spindle motor) into a suitable (stable) state for actual machining. Evidently, the use of this strategy comes with the associated commercial and environmental repercussions. In this paper, we investigate the exploitability of automated planning techniques for <b>planning</b> <b>machine</b> activities between manufacturing operations.

40|$|There has {{recently}} been an increased emphasis on reducing energy consumption in manufacturing. This is largely because of fluctuations in energy costs causing uncertainty. The increased competition between manufacturers means that even a slight change in energy consumption can have implications on their profit margin or competitiveness of quote. Furthermore, there is a drive from policy-makers to audit {{the environmental impact of}} manufactured goods from cradle-to-grave. The understanding, and potential reduction of machine tool energy consumption has therefore received significant interest as they require large amounts of energy to perform either subtractive or additive manufacturing tasks. One area that has received relatively little interest, yet could harness great potential, is reducing energy consumption by optimally <b>planning</b> <b>machine</b> activities while the machine is not in operation. The intuitive option is to turn off all non-essential energy-consuming processes. However, manufacturing processes such as milling often release large amounts of heat into the machine's structure causing deformation, which results in deviation of the machine tool's actual cutting position from that which was commanded, a phenomenon known as thermal deformation. A rapid change in temperature can increase the deformation, which can deteriorate the machine's manufacturing capability, potentially producing scrap parts with the associated commercial and environmental repercussions. It is therefore necessary to consider the relationship between energy consumption, thermal deformation, machining accuracy and time, when planning the machine's activity when idle, or about to resume machining. In this paper, we investigate the exploitability of automated planning techniques for <b>planning</b> <b>machine</b> activities between subtractive manufacturing operations, while being sufficiently broad to be extended to additive processes. The aim is to reduce energy consumption but maintain machine accuracy. Specifically, a novel domain model is presented where the machine's energy consumption, thermal stability, and their relationship to the overall machine's accuracy is encoded. Experimental analysis then demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach using a case study which considers real-world dat...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT) Technological and {{strategic}} developments {{have changed the}} role of human operators in the manufacturing environment. The highly specialized work force of the low-tech manufacturing system has evolved into the multi-functional work force of the high-tech manufacturing system. Among the multiple tasks that an operator is expected to conduct in advanced manufacturing systems (AMS) are job scheduling, inventory <b>planning,</b> <b>machine</b> set-up, problem solving, and quality inspection. The quality inspection task in AMS consists of a search component, frequently conducted by a machine, and a decision making component conducted by the operator. This quality inspection system {{is often referred to}} as a hybrid inspection system (HIS). It has been demonstrated that in general the performance of HIS is better than that of pure human or pure automated inspection systems. This research investigated the effects of different types of defects (presented at the same time in the inspected parts), multitasking (concurrently conducting independent tasks), and their interaction on the operator’s performance in the quality inspection task (with a memorized quality criteria) in an AMS...|$|E
