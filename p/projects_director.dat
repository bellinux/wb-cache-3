5|$|After working {{together}} on other <b>projects,</b> <b>director</b> Martin Ritt and Paul Newman co-founded Salem Productions and the company made a three-film deal with Paramount Studios. For its first film Salem hired husband-and-wife scriptwriters Irving Ravetch and Harriet Frank, Jr., who worked with Ritt and Newman on The Long, Hot Summer. Ravetch found Larry McMurtry's novel, Horseman, Pass By, in an airport shop during a Dallas stopover and presented the project to Ritt and Newman after reading a description of Hud Bannon. The partners met Ravetch and Frank at their home, approved the project and the writers adapted the script.|$|E
5|$|Carter J. Burke (Paul Reiser) {{is special}} <b>projects</b> <b>director</b> of Weyland-Yutani Corporation's Special Services Division {{and the primary}} {{antagonist}} of Aliens. After telling Ellen Ripley about her daughter's death and hearing her account of the Nostromo incident, Burke uses the information to have LV-426's colonists rendezvous with the Derelict and trigger an Alien outbreak. He persuades her to join the Colonial marine expedition, to destroy (not extract) specimens, as an adviser in exchange for her regaining her flight license. Burke accompanies the squad aboard Sulaco to safeguard the company's investment in the terraforming colony. His ulterior motives are discovered by Ripley; his rationale is that the Aliens are an important species they cannot exterminate and the facility is a significant investment. Burke tries to have Ripley and Newt impregnated by imprisoned facehuggers, but the Colonial Marines intervene. Although most of the survivors press for Burke's execution, Ripley protests; the Aliens cut the power and use an architectural-design flaw {{to break into the}} room. He escapes, leaving {{the rest of the group}} to die, but is confronted by an Alien in the locked medical lab and his screams are heard by those outside.|$|E

2500|$|The story then jumps forward 34 years; Dirk Pitt, Special <b>Projects</b> <b>Director</b> for the National Underwater and Marine Agency (NUMA), is vacationing with Colorado Congresswoman Loren Smith at her father’s {{cabin in}} the Sawatch Mountains.

Eissler designated Masson {{to succeed him}} as Director of the Sigmund Freud Archives after his and Anna Freud's death. Masson learned German and studied the history of psychoanalysis. In 1980 Masson was appointed <b>Projects</b> <b>Director</b> of the Freud Archives, with full access to Freud's correspondence and other unpublished papers. While perusing this material, Masson concluded that Freud might have rejected the seduction theory in order to {{advance the cause of}} psychoanalysis and to maintain his own place within the psychoanalytic inner circle, after a hostile response from the renowned sex-pathologist Richard von Krafft-Ebing {{and the rest of the}} Vienna Psychiatric Society in 1896 - [...] "an icy reception from the jackasses," [...] was the way Freud described it later to Fliess ...|$|E

40|$|The Swedish {{construction}} industry faces a current construction boom with several large infrastructure projects being executed, {{especially in the}} urban areas around the larger cities. There is an on-going trend where the projects become larger and larger, which also complies with international trends where the projects are even larger. Earlier research describes site managers as problem-solvers that muddle through their working-tasks reactively, and consider administration as an extra workload that impedes their possibility to lead the production. The role of the <b>project</b> <b>director</b> {{can be described as}} a role that mainly focuses on work with strategic management, coordination and much administration, and due to large financial risks, the <b>project</b> <b>director</b> needs a proactively way of working. Through a qualitative research, the authors have conducted an abductive literature review of construction project characteristics, organizational structures, project management, {{and the role of the}} site manager. Furthermore, an interview study was conducted with seven <b>project</b> <b>directors</b> representing the contractor, and two <b>project</b> <b>director</b> representatives from the Swedish Transport Administration. The study aimed to investigate and discuss the possibility to appoint a <b>project</b> <b>director</b> without the traditional career path, and thereby not having the traditional production-related working life experience. The study indicated that there are differences in how <b>project</b> <b>directors</b> perceive themselves and their working tasks compared to the traditional site manager. By natural causes, there are great similarities since the two professions are different sides of the same coin. However, a <b>project</b> <b>director</b> should, and must emphasize strategic and organization management in greater extent than a traditional site manager. The study showed that there is a possibility to appoint a <b>project</b> <b>director</b> without the traditional background, although it is considered to be a necessity to have a general understanding and knowledge about the processes in the {{construction industry}}. An appointment of a "non-traditional" <b>project</b> <b>director</b> will however lead to some adjustments of the organization structure, and would require a project organization with high degree of knowledge and experience in other key roles, as well as decentralized decision-making...|$|R
