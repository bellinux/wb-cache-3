The route was withdrawn in 1985 due to a fall in passenger numbers which coincided with the rebranding of the main route as Timesaver.|$|E
5|$|Current {{research}} suggests that the rates of self-harm are much higher among young people with the average age of onset between 14 and 24. The earliest reported incidents of self-harm are in children between 5 and 7 years old. In the UK in 2008 rates of self-harm in young people could be as high as 33%. In addition there appears to be an increased risk of self-harm in college students than among the general population. In a study of undergraduate students in the US, 9.8% of the students surveyed indicated that they had purposefully cut or burned themselves on at least one occasion in the <b>past.</b> <b>When</b> the definition of self-harm was expanded to include head-banging, scratching oneself, and hitting oneself along with cutting and burning, 32% of the sample said they had done this. In Ireland, a study found that instances of hospital-treated self-harm were much higher in city and urban districts, than in rural settings. The CASE (Child & Adolescent Self-harm in Europe) study suggests that the life-time risk of self-injury is ~1:7 for women and ~1:25 for men.|$|E

The announcement was just ahead of the Toy Industry Association's annual February exhibition, where representatives held a sampling booth of the products. Other promotional partners include bracelet-maker Colantotte, Dr Pepper, Farmers Insurance, Harley-Davidson, Hershey, Land O'Frost lunchmeats, Oracle, Red Baron pizza, Symantec, Visa and Wyndham Hotels & Resorts. In total, Marvel and its parent-company Disney secured an estimated $100million in worldwide marketing support for the film. Notable exclusions include Baskin-Robbins, Burger King and Dunkin' Donuts, who had partnered with Marvel in the <b>past</b> <b>when</b> their films were distributed by Paramount.

5|$|Second, all {{solutions}} {{suggest that}} there was a gravitational singularity in the <b>past,</b> <b>when</b> R went to zero and matter and energy were infinitely dense. It may seem that this conclusion is uncertain because {{it is based on the}} questionable assumptions of perfect homogeneity and isotropy (the cosmological principle) and that only the gravitational interaction is significant. However, the Penrose–Hawking singularity theorems show that a singularity should exist for very general conditions. Hence, according to Einstein's field equations, R grew rapidly from an unimaginably hot, dense state that existed immediately following this singularity (when R had a small, finite value); this is the essence of the Big Bang model of the Universe. Understanding the singularity of the Big Bang likely requires a quantum theory of gravity, which has not yet been formulated.|$|E

5|$|Stelae {{have become}} {{threatened}} {{in modern times}} by plundering for sale on the international art market. Many stelae are found in remote areas and their size and weight prevents them from being removed intact. Various methods are used to cut or break a stela for easier transport, including power saws, chisels, acid and heat. When a monument is well preserved, the looters attempt to cut off its face for transport. Even when successful, this results in damage to inscriptions {{on the sides of}} the stela. At worst, this method results in complete fragmentation of the stela face with any recoverable sculpture removed for sale. Traceable fragments of well known monuments have been purchased by American museums and private collectors in the <b>past.</b> <b>When</b> such monuments are removed from their original context, their historical meaning is lost. Although museums have justified their acquisition of stelae fragments with the argument that such objects are better preserved in an institution, no stela has been sold in as good a condition as it was in its original location. After 1970 there was a sharp drop in Maya stelae available on the New York art market due to the ratification of a treaty with Mexico that guarantees the return of stolen pre-Columbian sculpture that was removed from the country after the ratification date. In the early 1970s some museums, such as that of the University of Pennsylvania, responded to international criticism by no longer purchasing archaeological artefacts that lack a legally documented history, including place of origin, previous owners and an export license. Harvard University also instituted a similar policy in the early 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Three months later, a {{masquerade}} party ensues in {{the opera}} house. At the party, Christine wears her new engagement ring from Raoul.

Raoul exits the room and Christine approaches the Phantom. At {{the sight of the}} engagement ring, the Phantom rips it from Christine and disappears into a trap on the floor. Raoul tries to follow him but is stopped by Madame Giry, who privately tells him the story of the Phantom's <b>past.</b> <b>When</b> she was a little girl, she went to a freak circus where they featured a deformed child in a cage. The child was beaten while everyone watched and laughed. The ringmaster then removed a burlap sack covering the child's face, revealing his deformity. Only the young Madame Giry pitied him. She was the last to leave and saw the child strangle the ringmaster with a rope. Chased by the police, Madame Giry helped him escape and found shelter for him beneath the opera house, where she has hidden him from the world ever since.|$|E

40|$|The {{title of}} this {{research}} paper is “An Error Analysis of Simple Past Tense in Students’ Composition Focusing on Narrative Text”. It is written to be submitted to the English Department of Pasundan University. The participant of the study are eighth grade student at SMPN 36 Bandung academic year 2014 / 2015. The study {{was conducted on the}} first of June. The objectives were to describe the errors of simple past tense produced by students in writing narrative text to find out students’ difficulties in using simple <b>past</b> tense <b>when</b> writing questions based on narrative text, to find out the students’ errors in using Simple <b>Past</b> Tense <b>when</b> answering questions and to find out the influence of errors produced by students. The research method was qualitative method. The instrument was students’ test, the theory that was applied based on Stephen Pit Corder’s theory. The research findings were: 20 students produced errors in using Simple <b>Past</b> Tense <b>when</b> they wrote a composition focusing on narrative text, 15 students produced errors in using Simple <b>Past</b> Tense <b>when</b> they wrote some questions based on their composition focusing on narrative text, 15 students produced errors in using Simple <b>Past</b> Tense <b>when</b> they answer their questions that are written based on their composition focusing on narrative text and the influenced of L 1 when they wrote their composition focusing on narrative text (e. g; “you went to Bandung last night?” It must be changed by “did you go to Bandung last night?” and “you happy last night?” it must be changed by “were you happy last night?”). It can be put forward that some students still {{do not know how to}} use Simple <b>Past</b> Tense <b>when</b> they write or when they make questions and answer the questions. in addition some of them are influenced by L 1 interference.
