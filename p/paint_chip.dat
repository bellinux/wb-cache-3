5|$|Some lead {{compounds}} are colorful {{and are used}} widely in paints, and lead paint is a major route of lead exposure in children. A study conducted in 1998–2000 found that 38 million housing units in the US had lead-based paint, down from a 1990 estimate of 64 million. Deteriorating lead paint can produce dangerous lead levels in household dust and soil. Deteriorating lead paint and lead-containing household dust are the main causes of chronic lead poisoning. The lead breaks down into the dust and since children {{are more prone to}} crawling on the floor, it is easily ingested. Many young children display pica, eating things that are not food. Even a small amount of a lead-containing product such as a <b>paint</b> <b>chip</b> or a sip of glaze can contain tens or hundreds of milligrams of lead. Eating chips of lead paint presents a particular hazard to children, generally producing more severe poisoning than occurs from dust. Because removing lead paint from dwellings, e.g. by sanding or torching creates lead-containing dust and fumes, it is generally safer to seal the lead paint under new paint (excepting moveable windows and doors, which create paint dust when operated). Alternately, special precautions must be taken if the lead paint is to be removed. In oil painting it was once common for colours such as yellow or white to be made with lead carbonate. Lead white oil colour was the main white of oil painters until superseded by compounds containing zinc or titanium in the mid-20th century. It is speculated that the painter Caravaggio and possibly Francisco Goya and Vincent Van Gogh had lead poisoning due to overexposure or carelessness when handling this colour.|$|E

5000|$|Yet analysts (and Wegner himself) {{have pointed}} out that, for the artist, color is often a path to other topics. His color-based “D65” series, begun in 2014, takes its title from “the {{standard}} scientific shorthand for the color of daylight, roughly 6500 degrees Kelvin” and is “inspired by sunlight in California,” according to Wegner. More than a decade earlier, Meltzer linked his use of color with market mechanisms. She wrote of the <b>paint</b> <b>chip</b> works that “there is always the problem of capital and its ideological effects. After all the <b>paint</b> <b>chip</b> is an advertising tool—a ploy {{to make a buck}} on a dream. Wegner’s work makes these systems palpable, not through barefaced institutional critique, but by quietly elbowing some room into their rigid structures or—as he says in his book The Other Today Is the One You Want (2002)—by ‘opening up the space between the lines’ and ‘pushing back the horizon.’” ...|$|E
50|$|Another core {{theme in}} Wegner’s work is color. Professor, author, and critic Eve Meltzer {{noted in a}} 2002 review that “color may be the… center” of his entire practice. Poet and essayist John Koethe also {{described}} Wegner as “obsessed with color.” The artist first began deconstructing the subject in the late 1990s with his “Remarks On Color” series, which used commercial <b>paint</b> <b>chip</b> samples as their starting point.|$|E
5000|$|Instead of {{depending}} {{solely on}} the <b>painted</b> <b>chips</b> like {{they did in the}} previous experiment, they [...] "began presenting items of natural or artificial object and asking...’what stain does it have’, a question provided us by a bilingual teacher"(1975). He mentioned later {{that they were able to}} find objects of all colors except pink and brown and that this type of color naming procedure helped the participants answer more quickly and was more enjoyable during the study. In addition to this way of color questioning, they also brought some painted cards because they could not find <b>painted</b> <b>chips</b> and used those along with the objects.|$|R
40|$|Van der Klooster(1) {{provided}} an informative case study and overview on lead poisoning.

Many of these substances will also exhibit neurotoxicity(2, 3). A list of some heavy metals that can also be associated with paint is shown in Table I. Even with a lower use of lead-based paint {{in many parts of the}} world (e. g. United States), toxicity from paint ingestion or other routes of exposure remains important...|$|R
25|$|Lead poisoning* is {{uncommon}} in dogs. Exposure to lead is from eating <b>paint</b> <b>chips</b> from lead-based <b>paint</b> (found in houses painted prior to 1950), and eating lead {{objects such as}} shot, fishing sinkers, or counterweights. Signs of poisoning include vomiting, diarrhea, blindness, seizures, and tremors.|$|R
50|$|Instruments of {{this sort}} have an {{inconclusive}} range, and when a reading falls in this range (range is different for each instrument and model), a <b>paint</b> <b>chip</b> may be taken and sent for laboratory analysis. Testing for lead in dust, water, and air also require laboratory analysis. Commercially available lead test kits are often used to test {{for the presence of}} lead, but they are not reliable and not authorized by HUD to be used in determining if a property is lead-based-paint free.|$|E

50|$|Snouder's Drug Store was {{the oldest}} {{operating}} business in Oyster Bay, New York. The store was first established in 1884. The first telephone in Oyster Bay was installed here, and for several years it remained {{the only one in}} town. When Theodore Roosevelt became Governor of New York State and later President, the press corps gathered at Snouder's to transmit news from Oyster Bay. Phone service and the soda fountain installed in 1889 made Snouder's {{one of the most popular}} gathering places in town. In the 1990s the exterior was returned to its original color, which was determined through <b>paint</b> <b>chip</b> analysis.

50|$|Lead-based paints were {{commonly}} used in Oakland until its ban in 1978, {{and as many as}} 85,000 still extant houses built in Oakland in that time period likely used lead <b>paint.</b> <b>Paint</b> <b>chips</b> or dust from pre-1978 paint contributes greatly to lead pollution in Oakland.

5000|$|A third theme {{identified}} in Wegner’s work is language. Meltzer writes that Wegner’s <b>paint</b> <b>chip</b> pieces beg the question: “How can so many shades of red claim {{the same name}} when, clearly, language’s system of difference can’t fracture fast enough or splinter small {{enough to cover the}} range?” In a 2007 essay, curator Henriette Huldisch observed that Wegner “repeatedly invokes language specifically to create associations, to link his works back to the world of ideas and things from which they originated: systems of classification, names of places, and the incidental items of our daily lives (rulers, billboards, contracts, and so on).” Huldisch goes on to describe how “Wegner also works as a bibliophile collagist, appropriating snippets of marketing jargon, then cutting and pasting the functional epithets into semi-accidental verse he terms ‘poetry written by commerce.’” ...|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{challenging}} aspects of the conservation of Kamehameha the Great (original cast) was determining the original appearance of the statue. Since conservators traditionally strive to uphold the artist’s intent when caring for an artwork, figuring out this piece of information was of critical importance. While the Honolulu cast sported a patinated surface with gilt (See gilding) garments, the North Kohala cast had been painted in lifelike colors for as long as any local residents of the island could remember, and it wasn’t clear whether the statue had been originally gilt or painted. Historical accounts provided little assistance to the investigation, as articles written on the sculpture {{at the time of its}} unveiling in the 1880s offered conflicting and often contradictory descriptions of the artwork. However, by analyzing <b>paint</b> <b>chip</b> samples taken from the statue’s surface using X-ray fluorescence and X-ray diffraction, Wharton was eventually able to gather evidence of 24kt gold leaf residue beneath the layers of paint, effectively concluding that the statue had, like its Honolulu counterpart, an original patinated and gilded surface. [...] Wharton theorized that because of damage caused by the shipwreck, the sculpture’s surface had corroded badly before its eventual transport to Hawaii in 1883, and due to lack of materials and technical expertise to regild and patinate the surface, the statue was instead cleaned and then painted entirely brown in order to prepare it in time for Kalākaua’s coronation ceremony. At some point between 1883 and 1912, the tradition of painting the sculpture in multiple colors began.|$|E

50|$|UV is {{an investigative}} tool {{at the crime}} scene helpful in {{locating}} and identifying bodily fluids such as semen, blood, and saliva. For example, ejaculated fluids or saliva can be detected by high-power UV sources, irrespective of the structure or colour of the surface the fluid is deposited upon.UV-Vis microspectroscopy is also used to analyze trace evidence, such as textile fibers and <b>paint</b> <b>chips,</b> as well as questioned documents.|$|R
40|$|Many {{languages}} without separate {{terms for}} {{green and blue}} are or were spoken in locations receiving above-average exposure to ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation. It has been proposed that this correlation is caused by premature lens aging. This conclusion was supported by an experiment in which younger observers used the term "blue" less often when they described simulated <b>paint</b> <b>chips</b> filtered through the equivalent of an older observer's lens - removing much short-wavelength light - than when they described the unfiltered {{versions of the same}} <b>paint</b> <b>chips.</b> Some stimuli that were called "blue" without simulated aging were called "green" when filtered. However, in the experiment reported here, we found that the proportion of "blue" color-name responses did not differ between younger subjects and older observers with known ocular media optical densities. Color naming for stimuli that were nominally green, blue-green, or blue was virtually identical for older and younger observers who viewed the same (unfiltered) stimuli. Our results are inconsistent with the lens-brunescence hypothesis. Copyright © 2005 American Psychological Society...|$|R
