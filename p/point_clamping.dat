This new DC-DC converter suitable for high power applications is implemented by modifying the high-frequency-linked half bridge soft switching PWM DC-DC converter with two active edge resonant cells in high side and low side DC rails, which is previously-developed put into practice by the authors.

40|$|Pulse-width {{modulated}} (PWM) inverters {{are known}} to generate common mode voltages which cause motor bearing currents in the induction motor drives. They also result in leakage currents which act as sources of conducted electromagnetic interference in the drive system. The common mode voltage generated by a conventional three-level inverter can be eliminated by switching only the voltage space vectors which do not produce the common mode voltage. This paper presents a PWM switching strategy to eliminate common mode voltage using the open-end winding configuration for the induction motor. The switching strategy presented in this paper, does not generate any alternating common mode voltages in the drive system and hence the electrostatic coupling of the common mode voltage, which results in the bearing currents and the leakage currents, is avoided. The proposed scheme is devoid of neutral point voltage fluctuations and does not require neutral <b>point</b> <b>clamping</b> diodes, {{when compared to the}} common mode elimination scheme based on the conventional three-level inverter topology.
