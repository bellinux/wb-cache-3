Commonly, it {{is the amount of}} salt in the buffer which is varied. In 2012, Müller and Franzreb described the effects of temperature on HIC using Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) with four different types of hydrophobic resin. The study altered temperature as to effect the binding affinity of BSA onto the matrix. It was concluded that cycling temperature from 50 degrees to 10 degrees would not be adequate to effectively wash all BSA from the matrix but could be very effective if the column would only be used a few times. Using temperature to effect change allows labs to cut costs on buying salt and saves money.|$|E

The second finding was that the effect of <b>pH</b> <b>changes</b> on the potency of d-Tc and vecuronium was very different from that of metocurine, pancuronium or alcuronium. The action of d-Tc and vecuronium was potentiated in acidosis and antagonized in alkalosis.

40|$|In {{electrochemical}} water desalination, a large {{difference in}} pH can develop between feed and effluent water. These <b>pH</b> <b>changes</b> {{can affect the}} long-term stability of membranes and electrodes. Often Faradaic reactions are implicated to explain these <b>pH</b> <b>changes.</b> However, quantitative theory has not been developed yet to underpin these considerations. We develop a theory for electrochemical water desalination which includes not only Faradaic reactions but {{also the fact that}} all ions in the water have different mobilities (diffusion coefficients). We quantify the latter effect by microscopic physics-based modeling of <b>pH</b> <b>changes</b> in Membrane Capacitive Deionization (MCDI), a water desalination technology employing porous carbon electrodes and ion-exchange membranes. We derive a dynamic model and include the following phenomena: I) different mobilities of various ions, combined with acid-base equilibrium reactions; II) chemical surface charge groups in the micropores of the porous carbon electrodes, where electrical double layers are formed; and III) Faradaic reactions in the micropores. The theory predicts small <b>pH</b> <b>changes</b> during desalination cycles in MCDI if we only consider phenomena I) and II), but predicts that these <b>pH</b> <b>changes</b> can be much stronger if we consider phenomenon III) as well, which is in line with earlier statements in the literature on the relevance of Faradaic reactions to explain pH fluctuations. </p...|$|R
