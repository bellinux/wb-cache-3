5|$|After serving {{twelve years}} as a prosecutor, Thorne-Begland was {{nominated}} for an open seat on the General District Court of Richmond in 2012, but the Virginia House of delegates rejected him for the position for his perceived advocacy on homosexual issues. The Richmond Circuit Court judges granted him a temporary appointment to the post on June 14, 2012.

5|$|After {{starting}} 28th, Kevin Harvick {{had advanced}} to the tenth <b>position</b> <b>by</b> lap 28. Two laps later, Greg Biffle said on his team radio that he could smell smoke in his race car, which his team responded that {{it was probably a}} tire rubbing against the car. During lap 34, Martin Truex, Jr. moved to seventh, having started 25th on the grid. Four laps later, Hamlin had moved to the 22nd position after his earlier accident. On the 41st lap, Truex, Jr. moved past Johnson to claim the fourth position, while Hamlin continued to move toward the front runners. Edwards had over a one-second lead over the second <b>position</b> <b>by</b> lap 46. On the following lap, Hamlin took over the 18th position. After 50 laps, only 38 cars remained on the same lap as the leader. Edwards continued to expand his lead from 1.33 to 1.6 seconds in only five laps. On lap 54, Edwards was the leader, ahead of Allmendinger, Kahne, Truex, and Johnson.|$|E
5|$|Another modern {{development}} (in {{use in the}} Netherlands) is {{the creation}} of housing communities at the edges of wetlands with floating structures, restrained in <b>position</b> <b>by</b> vertical pylons. Such wetlands can then be used to accommodate runoff and surges without causing damage to the structures while also protecting conventional structures at somewhat higher low-lying elevations, provided that dikes prevent major surge intrusion.|$|E

5|$|At {{approximately}} 3:30am 20 SEALs {{and about}} 24 US Army Rangers from the 75th Ranger Regiment (wearing night-vision goggles) approached the compound, fast roping from two CH-47 Chinook helicopters. They were fired {{on from the}} compound and from a nearby <b>position</b> <b>by</b> Taliban armed with AK-47s, rocket-propelled grenades, and suicide vests. Two American snipers aboard a helicopter killed two guards using sound-suppressed rifles. An AC-130 Spectre gunship provided the US {{troops on the ground}} with close air support, killing two fleeing Taliban. The Rangers secured enemy positions on the nearby hills, and all six Taliban gunmen who fought the US forces were killed.|$|E
5|$|At {{least one}} V-2 missile on a mobile Meillerwagen launch trailer was {{observed}} being elevated to launch <b>position</b> <b>by</b> a USAAF 4th Fighter Group pilot over the northern German attack route {{near the town}} of Lochem on 1 January 1945. Possibly on account of the launch crew sighting the American fighter, the rocket was quickly lowered from a near launch-ready 85° elevation to 30°.|$|E
5|$|Brown partnered the {{recovered}} Barnes and patiently scored 140, {{before being}} the fifth man {{out with the}} score at 344, as Australia amassed 456 and defeated Derbyshire by an innings immediately after the Fourth Test. Looking to regain his Test <b>position</b> <b>by</b> sheer weight of runs, Brown started slowly; Barnes made 24 of the first 29 runs. He took 185 minutes to reach 50, much to the displeasure of the restless spectators, before accelerating and scoring his next 50 runs in 37 minutes.|$|E

5|$|Darwaza was {{convinced}} that interpretations of the Quran were the only possible basis for any renewal and development of Islamic religious, political and social thought, and that the Quran was the only resource for Muslim reinterpretation of traditional norms in Islam and Islamic thinking. Since it was quite uncommon to follow a chronological order for a whole tafsir—which Darwaza did—he had to justify his <b>position</b> <b>by</b> seeking a fatwa from the muftis of Aleppo and Damascus.|$|E

5|$|Heraclius the Elder is next {{mentioned}} in 608 as Patrician and Exarch of Africa. According to Patriarch Nikephoros, Heraclius the Elder {{had been appointed}} to the <b>position</b> <b>by</b> Maurice prior to the latter's deposition and death in 602. He might have replaced Innocentius, a temporary exarch appointed between 598 and 600. The appointment suggests that Heraclius the Elder enjoyed the favor of Maurice and would have reason to remain loyal to him. Heraclius the Elder and his African court notably lamented the death and execution of Maurice and posthumously praised the fallen emperor.|$|E
5|$|Hélio Castroneves, the {{defending}} champion of the Indy Japan 300, won the pole <b>position</b> <b>by</b> posting the fastest lap in qualifying. In the race, Wheldon gained the lead from Castroneves on lap 44 and led {{for more than half}} of the 200 laps, but a pit stop with 14 laps remaining forced him to relinquish the top position. Kanaan took the lead because of a late pit stop by Dixon, and held off a late challenge by Wheldon to secure first place.|$|E

5|$|In 1876, Wallace {{needed a}} £500 advance from the {{publisher}} of The Geographical Distribution of Animals {{to avoid having to}} sell some of his personal property. Darwin was very aware of Wallace's financial difficulties and lobbied long and hard to get Wallace awarded a government pension for his lifetime contributions to science. When the £200 annual pension was awarded in 1881, it helped to stabilise Wallace's financial <b>position</b> <b>by</b> supplementing the income from his writings.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, Dodd {{stepped down}} as head {{football}} coach due to health concerns, and he was succeeded by assistant Bud Carson.

Dodd retired as athletic director in 1976 and was followed in the <b>position</b> <b>by</b> Doug Weaver. Dodd continued to serve during his retirement years as an Alumni Association consultant and as a fundraiser for Georgia Tech. In 1983, he expressed interest in running a United States Football League team if Atlanta were awarded one, but the league folded before Atlanta received a team.|$|E
