50|$|In {{order to}} make the {{durability}} of the rubber duck stronger, they added another piece on top of one layer. On the rubber duck, there is an opening {{at the back of the}} body so that architects and staff can perform a body check of the rubber duck. In addition, there is an electric <b>propeller</b> <b>fan</b> in its body so that it can be inflated at any time, in either good or bad weather. The electric <b>propeller</b> <b>fan</b> also keeps the air circulating inside of the rubber duck, so that the air always keeps the shape of the rubber duck sculpture.|$|E

40|$|Research on <b>propeller</b> <b>fans</b> in {{underground}} drift stone mines {{has shown}} that significant ventilation improvements can be achieved. In large-entry mines {{that do not have}} any high resistance-sections (shafts> 100 ft long or shaft diameters < 12 ft), <b>propeller</b> <b>fans</b> can greatly increase the total system airflow. <b>Propeller</b> <b>fans</b> can be used as either main mine fans or as freestanding auxiliary (jet) fans. NIOSH researchers have documented the performance of two recently installed <b>propeller</b> <b>fans</b> in a working limestone mine (figure 1). Together the fans exhausted 750, 000 cfm at a rated hp of 200. These fans replaced an axial vane main mine fan that produced 300, 000 cfm at a rated hp of 250. The use of the <b>propeller</b> <b>fans</b> more than doubled the air quantity while operating at 50 hp less than the original main mine fan system. In addition, the new fans, when used with effective air-coursing methods such as stoppings, reduced or eliminated recirculation near the face areas. This is because <b>propeller</b> <b>fans</b> are more efficient at lower pressures and can produce large air quantities at lower horsepower requirements than axial vane fans.

5000|$|Tube-axial fans - Tube-axial {{fans are}} similar to <b>propeller</b> <b>fans</b> except they are mounted in a tube or cylinder. Therefore, they are more {{efficient}} than <b>propeller</b> <b>fans</b> and can develop up to 3 to 4 in. wg (743.3 to 995 Pa). They are best suited for moving air containing substances such as condensible fumes or pigments.|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{difficulties}} of ventilating large opening stone mines, the effective dilution of diesel particulate matter and noxious gases has often been problematic. Since stone mines have large openings that develop low air resistances, and <b>propeller</b> <b>fans</b> are designed for low pressure-high volume applications, main mine <b>propeller</b> <b>fans</b> may be a feasible option for ventilating underground stone mines. This paper describes {{the results of a}} case study where researchers from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health have demonstrated that significant increases in total mine airflow can be achieved and the ventilation improved in a large-opening stone mine by replacing an axial-vane mine fan with two 12 -ft diameter <b>propeller</b> <b>fans</b> and adding a line of stoppings. In this study, the use of the <b>propeller</b> <b>fans</b> more than doubled the air quantity from 300, 000 cfm to 750, 000 cfm, while operating at 50 horsepower less than the original axial-vane fan...|$|R

As Klondyke Collieries Limited, coke production at the site flourished. The horse whim was replaced by an electric winder, and air shaft sunk to the workings and fitted with an electric <b>propeller</b> <b>fan,</b> a screening and crushing plant was erected, and power supplied by the Electric Supply Company Limited.|$|E
5000|$|Early [...] "jet" [...] style model {{aircraft}} utilized a multi-blade and high pitched <b>propeller</b> (<b>fan)</b> inside ductwork, {{usually in the}} fuselage of the aeroplane. The fans were generally powered by 2 stroke piston engines that were designed to operate at high RPM. Early brands of these units were the Kress, Scozzi, and Turbax, among others. They generally used 0.40 to 0.90 cubic inch displacement engines, but Kress made a model for engines as small as 0.049 (1/2cc). This basic fan-in-tube design has been adopted very successfully for modern electric powered [...] "jet" [...] aircraft and are now quite popular. Glow engine powered ducted-fan aircraft are now relatively uncommon.|$|E
50|$|In the {{prototype}} development stage, {{it was originally}} an air-cooled single-cylinder, borrowing from their current motorcycle products, but a V-twin engine proved more practical. To aid in cooling, a forced air cooling system used a <b>propeller</b> <b>fan</b> to further direct airflow across the cylinders without an encased cooling shroud, and it used a dry sump oil lubrication design. The carburetor used was copied from a Wheeler-Schebler Carburetor Company design in a single barrel carburetor that {{was placed in the}} center behind the V-bank, distributing to the left and right cylinder bank, through a cross-flow cylinder head. The engine was installed suspended above the front wheel differential and in front of the transmission. This arrangement gave the vehicle a higher center of gravity, helping to keep the engine out of river crossing conditions, while it had disadvantages regarding engine vibration as compared with a horizontally-opposed engine layout, but due to Japanese Army requirements, this arrangement was a trade-off, meeting the primary goal set before the development team. The engine layout having a symmetrical implementation with the engine {{directly in front of the}} transmission, with a transfer case providing power to the front wheels installed directly below the engine made manufacture simple to deploy. Because there was a rudimentary production system closely resembling handmade assembly, minor changes took place to various aspects of the car as the need arose, with the early prototype two-door enclosed sedan evolving into a roadster. While some vehicles over time had body changes, many of the production cars were not installed with doors, and the canvas roof for the two-door and four-door vehicles aided in reducing overall weight and adding flexibility to conditions in the field.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} clarify {{relation}} between discrete frequency noise and non-homogenous circular {{wake of a}} <b>propeller</b> <b>fan</b> which is used in a rectangular casing, {{the characteristics of the}} propeller fans were analyzed by measurement of internal flow. The absolute velocity of main flow domain in the meridional plane of the <b>propeller</b> <b>fan</b> became 30 m/s while the velocity of the inclined plane in the case of 40 degree was decreased to 25 m/s. The velocity fluctuations on the vertical plane in the wake were weakened at the diagonal line of the duct by the velocity deformation formed to the circumferential direction around the impeller. Then the circular wake formed in the <b>propeller</b> <b>fan</b> was broken by the velocity deformation. It is considered that the discrete frequency noise of the <b>propeller</b> <b>fan</b> in the second harmonics became large because the fourteen dynamic rotors and the pseudo four stators made by the non-homogenous circular wake resonated...|$|E
40|$|Ring fan is a <b>propeller</b> <b>fan</b> {{that applies}} an axial-flow {{impeller}} with a ring-shaped shroud on the blade tip side. The fan has been expected {{not only to}} improve the aerodynamic characteristics but also to reduce the aerodynamic noise. In this study, the influence of wake on aerodynamic noise of a ring fan has been discussed by comparison with {{the characteristics of a}} current <b>propeller</b> <b>fan.</b> The blade rotating noise was assumed for the mechanism of the discrete frequency noise in the ring fan. Moreover, the theory for the estimation of the blade rotating noise based on the wake characteristics has been proposed. The overall noise level of the ring fan was decreased 3 dB than that of the <b>propeller</b> <b>fan</b> due to the discrete frequency noise in the first harmonics. As a result of CFD analysis, it is considered that the discrete frequency noise was generated from the blade surface of the impeller by the periodic pressure fluctuation synchronizing with the blade passing frequency. According with measured flow patterns, the relative velocity of the ring fan became slightly high than the <b>propeller</b> <b>fan</b> whereas the velocity fluctuation of the ring fan decreased approximately 71 % than that of the <b>propeller</b> <b>fan</b> in the near wake. From results of the estimation based on the proposed theory of the aerodynamic noise, it can be considered that the discrete frequency noise of the ring fan was decreased by the perturbation of the jet-wake flow in the wake...|$|E
40|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has {{investigated}} the unique ventilation requirements of large-opening mines {{to help identify}} and {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} various fan types to improve the ventilation and air quality in the underground workplace. Large-opening mines, with their low airflow resistance factors, can be ventilated with free-standing auxiliary fans because airflow pat-terns in these mines are primarily controlled by airflow momentum. The flow characteristics of both vane-axial and <b>propeller</b> <b>fans</b> were investigated and tested at four large-opening mines to assess the effects of fan location on recirculation and entrainment. Each fan type has its own airflow, entrainment and penetrating air-flow characteristics, and operating costs that are advantageous for specific applications. Either fan type can be used for most auxiliary applications.

40|$|Researchers {{from the}} National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health have {{demonstrated}} that mine-wide ventilation in large-opening stone mines can be improved by using low-pressure, high-volume propeller fans and constructing stoppings in key locations to direct and control airflow.

40|$|A ring fan is a <b>propeller</b> <b>fan</b> {{that applies}} an axial-flow {{impeller}} with a ring-shaped shroud on the blade tip side. In this study, the entire flow {{field of the}} ring fan is simulated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD); {{the accuracy of the}} CFD is verified through a comparison with the aerodynamic characteristics of a <b>propeller</b> <b>fan</b> of current model. Moreover, the aerodynamic noise generated by the fan is predicted {{on the basis of the}} wake characteristics. The aerodynamic characteristic of the ring fan based on CFD can represent qualitatively the variation in the measured value. The main flow domain of the ring fan is formed at the tip side of the blade because blade tip vortex is not formed at that location. Therefore, the relative velocity of the ring fan is increased by the circumferential velocity. The sound pressure levels of the ring fan within the frequency band of less than 200 Hz are larger than that of the <b>propeller</b> <b>fan.</b> In the analysis of the wake characteristics, it revealed that Karman vortex shedding occurred in the main flow domain in the frequency domain lower than 200 Hz; the aerodynamic noise of the ring fan in the vortex shedding frequency enlarges due to increase in the relative velocity and the velocity fluctuation...|$|E
40|$|A flow {{modeling}} for the meridional flow calculation in the aerodynamic {{design of}} the half-ducted turbomachinery blade rows has been presented. It is assumed that the meridional flow is axisymmetric and viscous one. To {{take into account the}} blade loading, a blade force is introduced as a body force to the axisymmeric Navier-Stokes equations. The blade force contains the inviscid blade effect only, namely, the pressure difference across a blade. Numerical examples have been presented for a wind-lens turbine and a half-ducted <b>propeller</b> <b>fan</b> in order to demonstrate the validity of the present flow modeling. For the wind-lens turbine, the present flow modeling can predict non-uniform flow distributions at the inlet and outlet of the turbine rotor. For the half-ducted <b>propeller</b> <b>fan,</b> however, the formation of the several separated and vortical flow structures results in the well prediction of the inlet flow angle only. It is found that the present flow modeling is useful to the blade row design tool...|$|E

When operated in steady state, {{none of the}} methods produced an acceptably uniform cloud (+ or - 5 percent of the mean concentration), and voids in the cloud were clearly visible. In some cases, severe particle agglomeration was observed; however, these clusters could be broken apart by a short acoustic burst from an axially in-line speaker.

40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the main factor of the {{periodical}} aerodynamic noise in the off-design point of the <b>propeller</b> <b>fan,</b> the relative flow field in the blade tip {{is measured by the}} hot-wire anemometer with the phase-lock method. In particular, we discuss the influence of the rotational speed of the impeller experimentally for clarifying the relationship between the relative flow field and the periodical aerodynamic noise. When the <b>propeller</b> <b>fan</b> is operated at the off-design point, the periodaical aerodynamic noise is generated in the lower frequency domain than that of the blade passing frequency. The energy of the velocity fluctuation in {{the leading edge of the}} blade tip became large at the same frequency band of the periodical aerodynamic noise. We indicated experimentally that the leakage flow at the leading edge in the relative flow did not interfere to the next blade. These experimental results indicate the periodical aerodynamic noise was generated because the pressure fluctuation due to the leakage flow became strong...|$|E

40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{were performed}} to investigate the sound generation mechanism of a <b>propeller</b> <b>fan</b> in the outdoor unit of an air conditioner. The vortex and separation flow around two- and three-bladed propeller fans were analyzed to locate the sources of noise. A two-bladed fan usually has a lower flow rate than a three-bladed fan at the same rotating speed. In general, a two-bladed fan should increase the rotating speed to obtain {{the same amount of}} flow rate as a three-bladed fan. The increased rotating speed of a two-bladed fan may results in a louder noise comparing a three-bladed fan. To overcome this drawback, an optimized two-bladed fan was proposed by increasing the solidity and pitch angle. During optimizing the two-bladed fan, the relative priorities of the design parameters were evaluated to identify the most important, and these parameters were then optimized using the response surface methodology. The overall sound pressure level (OASPL) of the new optimized two-bladed <b>propeller</b> <b>fan</b> was 5. 2 dB lower than that of previous two-bladed fans and 1. 2 dB lower than that of the optimized three-bladed fan...|$|E

40|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has {{conducted}} research {{to improve the}} ventilation of large-opening mines whose entries are at least 93 m 2 (1, 000 ft 2). The ventilation of large-opening mines is unique compared to other types of mines because (1) {{it is challenging to}} keep airflow velo cities high enough to effectively remove or dilute airborne contaminants because the entries are so large, (2) large air volumes can be moved through the mines with little static pressure drop, and (3) stopping that are used to direct ventilation airflows are costly to construct and to maintain.

40|$|The ring fan is a <b>propeller</b> <b>fan</b> by an axial-flow {{impeller}} {{that has}} a ring shape shroud on the bladetip side. In this study, the whole flow field of the ring fan is simulated by a CFD code; theaerodynamic noise generated by the fan is predicted based on the wake characteristics. Moreover, theaccuracy of the CFD code has been verified by comparing with the aerodynamic characteristics ofthe <b>propeller</b> <b>fan</b> of a current model. The aerodynamic characteristics of the ring fan by the CFD canrepresent the tendency of the measurement value qualitatively, however, the flow rate in the CFDbecomes 30 % lower than the actual measurement value. The main flow domain of the ring fan isformed at the tip side of the blade since the blade tip vortex is not formed at the blade tip side. Therefore, the relative velocity of the ring fan becomes fast due to the circumferential velocity. Thesound pressure levels of the ring fan in the frequency band less than 200 Hz become larger than thepropeller fan. According to the analysis on the wake characteristics, it clarified that (1) Karmanvortex at the main flow domain is shedding in the frequency domain lower than 200 Hz, (2) theaerodynamic sound of the ring fan on the vortex shedding frequency becomes large because of anincrease in the relative velocity and the velocity fluctuations...|$|E
