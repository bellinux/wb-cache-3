2500|$|Electrostatic induction, {{discovered}} by British scientist John Canton in 1753 and Swedish professor Johan Carl Wilcke in 1762 is a redistribution of charges in an object {{caused by the}} electric field of a nearby charge. [...] For example, if a <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> <b>object</b> is brought near an uncharged metal object, the mobile negatively-charged electrons in the metal will be attracted the external charge, {{and move to the}} side of the metal facing it, creating a negative charge on the surface. [...] When the electrons move out of an area they leave a positive charge due to the metal atoms' nuclei, so the side of the metal object facing away from the charge acquires a positive charge. These induced charges disappear when the external charge is removed. [...] Induction is also responsible for the attraction of light objects, such as balloons, paper scraps and styrofoam packing peanuts to static charges. [...] The surface charges induced in conductive objects exactly cancel external electric fields inside the conductor, so there is no electric field inside a metal object. [...] This is the basis for the electric field shielding action of a Faraday cage. [...] Since the electric field is the gradient of the voltage, electrostatic induction is also responsible for making the electric potential (voltage) constant throughout a conductive object.|$|E
5000|$|When a metal {{object is}} placed in a vacuum and is heated to incandescence, the energy is {{sufficient}} to cause electrons to [...] "boil" [...] away from the surface atoms and surround the metal object {{in a cloud of}} free electrons. This is called thermionic emission. The resulting cloud is negatively charged, and can be attracted to any nearby <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> <b>object,</b> thus producing an electric current which passes through the vacuum.|$|E
50|$|Charge is {{the measure}} of the {{electric}} current flowing through an object. A charge can be positive or negative — objects with a positive charge repel other positively charged objects, thereby causing them to push away from each other, while a <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> <b>object</b> would attract to a negatively charged object, thereby causing the two to draw together. Electrostatic charges are the charges associated with static electricity. Generally, electrostatic charges can build up by friction and can be observed when a balloon attracts a person's hair after the balloon is rubbed against the person's head.|$|E
5000|$|Voltage {{is defined}} so that {{negatively}} <b>charged</b> <b>objects</b> are pulled towards higher voltages, while <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> <b>objects</b> are pulled towards lower voltages. Therefore, the conventional current in a wire or resistor always flows from higher voltage to lower voltage. Current can flow from lower voltage to higher voltage, {{but only when}} a source of energy is present to [...] "push" [...] it against the opposing electric field. This is the case within any electric power source. For example, inside a battery, chemical reactions provide the energy needed for ion current to flow from the negative to the positive terminal.|$|R
30|$|Such a trap is {{suitable}} for capturing <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> <b>objects.</b> Generally, {{the depth of the}} trap, either in the potential (U) or in energy (i.e. qU, assuming that the charged particle has a charge q), decreases rapidly with increasing height (in z direction). When the screen effect is taken into account, the trap depth becomes even smaller than the stimulated values (Fig.  1 b) in vacuum, because the screen effect remarkably reduces the effective surface charge density at the trap electrodes. It is stimulated by COMSOL 4.3 b that the potential depth ΔU at z values (Fig.  1 a) of 0, 5, 10, and 15  μm are 1.18, 0.61, 0.43, and 0.38  V, respectively, as seen in Fig.  1 c. Nevertheless, the results mentioned later confirm that the remaining depth of the traps is still deep enough to trap individual or cluster of the charged micro-particles. In our device, as the medium is de-ionized (D.I.) water, the Debye length is in the order of 1  μm, which is deduced from the equation: λ D = (8 πl B c ∞)− 1 / 2. Here l B is Bjerrum length in water (0.71  nm for univalent ion) and c ∞ is salt ion concentration (10 − 7 M in D.I. water).|$|R
40|$|A <b>positively</b> <b>charged,</b> mixed bilayer vesicle in the {{presence}} of negatively charged surfaces (for example, colloidal particles) can spontaneously partition into an adhesion zone of definite area, and another zone that repels additional negative objects. Although the membrane itself has nonnegative charge in the repulsive zone, negative counterions on the interior of the vesicle spontaneously aggregate there, and present a net negative charge to the exterior. Beyond the fundamental result that oppositely <b>charged</b> <b>objects</b> can repel, our mechanism helps explain recent experiments on surfactant vesicles. ...|$|R
5000|$|The needle {{turns to}} point {{at a nearby}} charged object due to charges induced in {{the ends of the}} needle by the {{external}} charge, through electrostatic induction. For example, if a <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> <b>object</b> is brought near, the mobile negative charges in the metal will be attracted to it, and move {{to the end of the}} needle nearest the object. The attractive force on these negative charges will then turn the needle until the end is nearest to the charged object, when it will stop. Conversely the positive charges in the needle will be repelled, and move to the far end of the needle. The repulsive forces will then push this end of the needle as far away from the object as possible. The result, after the needle stops swinging, is that the axis of the needle points through the object.|$|E
50|$|Franklin’s theory {{stated that}} {{electricity}} should {{be thought of}} as the movement of a single liquid, as opposed to the interaction between two liquids. A body would show signs of electricity when it held either too much, or too little of this liquid. A neutral object was therefore thought to contain a “normal” amount of this fluid. Franklin also outlined two possible states of electrification, positive and negative. He argued that a <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> <b>object</b> would contain too much fluid, while a negatively charged object would contain too little fluid. Franklin was able to apply this thinking by explaining unexplained phenomena of the time, such as the Leyden jar, a basic charge storing device similar to a battery. He argued that the wire and inner surface became positively charged, while the outer surface became negatively charged. This caused an imbalance in fluid, and a person touching both portions of the jar allowed the fluid to flow normally.|$|E
5000|$|The {{attraction}} {{occurs because}} of induced polarization of the atoms inside the pith ball. [...] The pith is a nonconductor, so the electrons in the ball {{are bound to}} atoms of the pith and are not free to leave the atoms and move about in the ball, but they can move a little within the atoms. See diagram at right. If, for example, a <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> <b>object</b> (B) is brought near the pith ball (A), the negative electrons (blue minus signs) in each atom (yellow ovals) will be attracted and move slightly toward {{the side of the}} atom nearer the object. The positively charged nuclei (red plus signs) will be repelled and will move slightly away. Since the negative charges in the pith ball are now nearer the object than the positive charges (C), their attraction is greater than the repulsion of the positive charges, resulting in a net attractive force. [...] This separation of charge is microscopic, but since there are so many atoms, the tiny forces add up to a large enough force to move a light pith ball.|$|E
40|$|Opposite <b>charged</b> <b>objects</b> attract {{each other}} in vacuum; same thing happens in {{solution}} according to Possion-Boltzmann theory. Yet it was observed in the experiment that a <b>positively</b> <b>charged,</b> mixed bilayer vesicle {{with the presence of}} negatively charged colloidal particles can spontaneously partition into an adhesion zone with some area and another zone that repels additional negative objects. ^ An adhesion saturation theory based on the Possion-Boltzmann theory was formulated to explain this phenomenon. Although the membrane is strictly <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> because it 2 ̆ 7 s a mixture of <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> and neutral surfactants, the counterions inside membrane can move laterally. The membrane charges along with inside counterions can partially de-mix into two regions by thermal instability. One region attracts more charged surfactants from the other region, and also attracts some positive counterions inside the membrane and renders the other region repulsive to additional incoming negative objects. ^ This thermal instability is strongest for thin impermeable membrane case. It is weakened but still exists for finite thickness membrane. And several improvements of mean-field PB theory are considered and the instability is robust under those modifications. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this study is the {{possible}} influence analogy making may have upon emotions experienced in everyday life. More specifically we address the question of whether emotions inherently associated with one domain tend to be transferred to another domain via analogical mapping connections. In an experiment we demonstrate that emotional appraisal is indeed a subject to analogical transfer. We also find a substantive difference between the situation in which the two domains are meaningfully mapped and the situation in which these are simply associated because of being encountered simultaneously. We also demonstrate that at least in cases when there is no clear distinction between the two domains in terms of which domain is the base and which domain is the target there is a bidirectional emotional transfer which affects emotional attitudes towards objects from both the domains. Thus whenever a <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> <b>object</b> is mapped onto a negatively charged object the <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> <b>object</b> receives negative valence from the negatively charged object and vice versa...|$|E
40|$|The {{charging}} of spinning insulating objects by plasma and photoemission is {{studied with}} the particle-in-cell method. Unidirectional photon flux, different angular velocities of the object, and different plasma flow speeds are considered. Photoemission {{can lead to}} a positive total charge and electric dipole moment on the object. The spinning of the object redistributes the surface charge. The total object charge oscillates in time with the period matching the period of the object rotation. Plasma potential and density {{in the vicinity of the}} object oscillate with the same frequency. The plasma is rarefied close to a <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> <b>object,</b> and the density wake diminishes when the object is charged negatively. The time averaged charge depends on the angular velocity of the object. Comment: 15 pages, 4 figures, submitted to Geophys. Res. Let...|$|E
40|$|Plasma {{polymerized}} allylamine {{films were}} deposited onto quartz particles at low pressure to optimize humic acid removal by varying the plasma power, flow rate, and polymerization times.

Increasing the allylamine flow rate {{increased the number of}} <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> groups but maximum humic acid removal was observed at 6. 48 sccm due to humic acid removal by <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> and uncharged crosslinked species. Longer polymerization times increased the number of <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> groups while similar humic acid removal resulted as the larger humic acid molecule cannot penetrate as readily into the film as the acid orange 7 used to determine the number of <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> groups.

40|$|AbstractCapillary {{electrochromatography}} (CEC) {{is shown}} {{to be capable of}} separating mixtures containing both <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> and neutral styrene oxide–adenosine adducts. In a study of the mechanism of deamination of <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> 1 -(2 -hydroxy- 1 -phenylethyl) adenosine using 18 O-labeled water, possible contamination of the chromatographically purified deamination product, 1 -(2 -hydroxy- 1 -phenylethyl) inosine, with the <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> 1 -(2 -hydroxy- 1 -phenylethyl) adenosine was observed. Because the deamination product and the presumed contamination have the same molecular weights and similar structures, CEC-microelectrospray mass spectrometry (CEC-μESI/MS) was used to confirm the presence and identity of the suspected impurity. A trace amount of the <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> 1 -(2 -hydroxy- 1 -phenylethyl) adenosine, which could not be observed by either HPLC-UV or CEC-UV, was detected by CEC-μESI/MS. This discriminatory ability of CEC-μESI/MS is attributed to the fact that positive ion mode ESI-MS is a more sensitive detector for a <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> compound than a UV detector, and that the combination of electroosmotic and electrophoretic flows and hydrophobic interactions with the stationary phase contributes to the separation of the <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> compound. As a result, the <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> compound was observed to elute much earlier and with much sharper peaks than the neutral compounds for which electroosmotic flow is the only “pumping” force for the solvent...|$|R

30|$|This was a “scrolling runner game.” The {{foreground}} would {{scroll to}} the right and the dragon would appear to fly to the left, towards the cloud. The dragon simulated quasi-random movements. Because the dragon had a charge of + 1, the r, or distance, of the dragon to the cloud was an important variable that effected when the lightning strike would occur. Participants watched the three minute animation that resulted in the dragon being struck three times. Because the trees also carried valences of + 1, they were sometimes struck as well, e.g. if the cloud was highly charged and it moved low on the screen it would strike the closest <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> <b>object</b> and that was sometimes a tree. When trees were hit with lightning, they would smolder and no points were gained. The game was designed so participant would deduce the interaction between: (1) qnet, as measured {{in the bottom of the}} cloud (the numerator of the equation); and (2) the distance of the dragon (the denominator) to the cloud.|$|E
30|$|These {{movement}} constraints {{made it so}} {{that players}} should not simply position the cloud to always be {{low in the sky}} because if the cloud were charged and low, it would strike the closest <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> <b>object.</b> That object would sometimes be a positive tree. As in the low embodied version A, when trees were hit with lightning they would smolder, no points were gained and the cloud reset to a neutral charge. The goal was to get the cloud close enough to the dragon to strike it and knock off pieces of equipment while not hitting trees. Only the participants in the fourth condition, with the narrative, understood these pieces of equipment were from the “vector machine.” The play mechanic was designed so that participants could use their knowledge of Coulomb’s law to be strategic. If players brought the cloud down too early they were penalized with tree strikes. The cloud would reset to zero qnet (thoroughly mixed positive and negative charges in the cloud) after each strike and it took a few seconds to build a negative charge back up, so it was important to not waste too many strikes within the 3 -min time limit. If players knocked all three pieces of equipment off the dragon before the time limit, the game still continued for the full 3 min to equate for time on task between conditions. The dragon would continue to move at the 0.66 -s rate until the clock ran down.|$|E

As in the {{previous}} condition, the cloud location was constrained to move within the top left quadrant of the screen (counted as 100 units vertical from top left corner). The seventh image in Fig.  4 shows the cloud in the far bottom right position. In the high embodied version, the Kinect was used to track the participant’s highest hand. The participant’s hand position controlled cloud location. Once the timer started the three minute countdown, the dragon would automatically “fly” toward the left edge of the screen (begin scrolling). The foregrounded fence and light poles scrolled to the right giving the illusion of the dragon flying. The participants controlled how close the cloud {{could get to the}} dragon. The dragon’s flight path was perceived as “quasi-random.” The players deduced they should not simply position the cloud to always be low in the sky, because if the cloud were highly charged and low, it would strike the closest <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> <b>object.</b> That object would sometimes be a positive tree. Similar to version A, when trees were hit with lightning this was deemed a mistake; the trees would smolder and the cloud reset to a neutral charge wasting game time. The play mechanic was designed so that participants could use their knowledge of Coulomb’s law to be strategic and win more effectively. It was important to not waste too many strikes within the three minute time limit. If players knocked all three pieces of equipment off the dragon before the time limit, the game still continued for the full 3 min to equate for time on task between conditions.|$|E

The number of <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> particles increased by several orders of magnitude when the target current was increased from 0. 1 A to 2. 5 A. When a high target current was used, many <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> particles with energies higher than the bond energy of single C–C bonds, which are typically found in organic molecules, were generated. In this situation, we observed serious OLED performance degradation. On the other hand, when a low target current was used, OLED performance degradation was not observed when the number of <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> particles colliding with the organic underlayer increased.

50|$|For the {{blockage}} {{of sodium}} channels, electrostatic interactions or hydrogen bonds are needed. Important for the electrostatic interaction {{is the presence}} of a <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> region in the toxin, because the receptor site of the sodium channel contains a lot of negatively charged residues. In HNTX-I, the <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> residues and a vicinal hydrophobic patch have most influence on the binding to the sodium channels. HNTX-IV has a <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> patch containing the amino acids Arg26, Lys27, His28, Arg29 and Lys32, of which Lys27, Arg29 and Lys32 are the most important for interaction with the TTX-S VGSCs.

40|$|Negatively charged DNA can be {{compacted}} by <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> dendrimers and {{the degree}} of compaction is a delicate balance between the strength of the electrostatic interaction and the elasticity of DNA. We report various elastic properties of short double stranded DNA (dsDNA) and the effect of dendrimer binding using fully atomistic molecular dynamics and numerical simulations. In equilibrium at room temperature, the contour length distribution P(L) and end-to-end distance distribution P(R) are nearly Gaussian, the former gives an estimate of the stretch modulus γ_ 1 of dsDNA in quantitative agreement with the literature value. The bend angle distribution P(θ) of the dsDNA also has a Gaussian form and allows to extract a persistence length, L_p of 43 nm. When the dsDNA is compacted by <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> dendrimer, the stretch modulus stays invariant but the effective bending rigidity estimated from the end-to-end distance distribution decreases dramatically due to backbone charge neutralization of dsDNA by dendrimer. We support our observations with numerical solutions of the worm-like-chain (WLC) model as well as using non-equilibrium dsDNA stretching simulations. These results are helpful in understanding the dsDNA elasticity at short length scales as well as how the elasticity is modulated when dsDNA binds to a <b>charged</b> <b>object</b> such as a dendrimer or protein.

30|$|Another {{critical}} factor which influences cellular uptake of NPs is surface charge. In the recent decade, nano surface modification has been employed to engineer the surface charge of NPs {{to be either}} cationic or anionic [92]. The negatively charged CM enhances the uptake of <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> NPs. In particular, <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> NPs have higher internalization than neutral and negatively charged NPs [47, 120]. However, the uptake of <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> NPs may disrupt the integrity of CM and {{lead to an increase}} in toxicity [121, 122]. In general, <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> NPs induce cell death [123, 124]. Interestingly, neutrally charged NPs will lower the cellular uptake as compared to negatively charged NPs [110, 125 – 127]. Moreover, the internalization of negatively charged NPs leads to gelation of membranes, while <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> NPs cause fluidity in the CM [128, 129]. In addition to the uptake rate of NP, surface charges also affect the uptake mechanisms. More specifically, <b>positively</b> <b>charged</b> NPs are mainly internalized by the cell via macropinocytosis whereas clathrin-/caveolae-independent endocytosis is the mechanism for the uptake of negatively charged NP [130]. Cellular uptake pathways vary when the surface of the AuNPs is coated by organic molecules. For instance, plain AuNPs which are <b>positively</b> <b>charged,</b> are internalized via macropinocytosis and clathrin and caveolin-mediated endocytosis, while negatively charged polyethylene glycol (PEG) coated AuNPs are mainly internalized via caveolin- and/or clathrin-mediated endocytosis [131].|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{transport}} of microscopic particles such as growth factors, proteins, or drugs through the extracellular matrix (ECM) {{is based on}} diffusion, a ubiquitous mechanism in nature. The ECM shapes the local distribution of the transported macromolecules {{and at the same}} time constitutes an important barrier toward infectious agents. To fulfill these competing tasks, the hydrogels have to employ highly selective filtering mechanisms. Yet, the underlying microscopic principles are still an enigma in cell biology and drug delivery. Here, we show that the extracellular matrix presents an effective electrostatic bandpass, suppressing the diffusive motion of both <b>positively</b> and negatively <b>charged</b> <b>objects.</b> This mechanism allows uncharged particles to easily diffuse through the matrix, while charged particles are effectively trapped. However, by tuning the strength of this physical interaction of the particles with the biopolymer matrix, the microscopic mobility of formerly trapped particles can be rescued on demand. Moreover, we identify heparan sulfate chains to be one important key factor for the barrier function of the extracellular matrix. We propose that localized charge patches in the ECM are responsible for its highly unspecific but strongly selective filtering effect. Such localized interactions could also account for the observed tunability and selectivity of many other important permeability barriers that are established by biopolymer-based hydrogels, e. g., the mucus layer of endothelial cells or the hydrogel in the nuclear core complex...|$|R
