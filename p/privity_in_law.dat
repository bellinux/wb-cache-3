50|$|The {{doctrine}} of <b>privity</b> <b>in</b> the common <b>law</b> of contract provides that a contract cannot confer rights or impose obligations arising under it on any person or agent except {{the parties to}} it.|$|R
50|$|The {{principle}} of <b>privity</b> <b>in</b> the common <b>law's</b> {{law of contract}} dictates that persons may not reap the benefits nor suffer the burdens of a contract {{to which they were}} not a party. Under the doctrine, if a consumer bought goods from a retailer who had originally bought them from the manufacturer, then, if the goods proved faulty, the consumer should sue the retailer. The consumer could not sue the manufacturer <b>in</b> contract <b>law</b> because no contract existed between them. The retailer could then counterclaim against the manufacturer. In most cases, however, consumers may rely on the manufacturer's guarantee that will have been assigned to them.|$|R
5000|$|In the US {{federal law}} of res judicata, privity {{is said to}} {{preclude}} a party to a legal action from raising an issue that either was raised or could have been raised in previous legal action. Under federal law, [...] "concepts summarized by the term privity are looked to {{as a means of}} determining whether the interests of the party against whom claim preclusion is asserted were represented in prior litigation." [...] Therefore, <b>privity</b> <b>in</b> federal common <b>law</b> is [...] "a convenient means of expressing conclusions that are supported by independent analysis." [...] Because privity is actually a term to summarize a conclusion that one party was precluded, it [...] "may exist for the purpose of determining one legal question but not another depending on the circumstances and legal doctrines at issue." ...|$|R
40|$|Privity and the inter-twined {{notion of}} {{consideration}} are key {{features of the}} classical Common law of contract. The need to protect reasonable expectations has created problems for Common <b>law</b> courts <b>in</b> the past, however, leading to adaptation {{of the doctrine of}} privity by both precedent and statute in many jurisdictions. This paper will move beyond the Common <b>law</b> <b>in</b> its analysis, however, through the use of both comparative law and sociolegal theory. The target jurisdictions of Australia and South Africa have both historically been strongly influenced by the English Common law of contract, but South Africa is a mixed legal system and Australian law has also developed along an independent path, particularly with regard to the protection of reasonable expectations. Our analysis will be based around three specific case studies, in order to contextualize the doctrine of privity and to describe the ‘law in action’, following an approach which draws on relational, or socially embedded, analysis. Our ultimate aim is to move from micro, black-letter case studies to an emergent macro picture. Given the (historically) cornerstone status of <b>privity</b> <b>in</b> the Common <b>law,</b> this will allow us to comment on themes such as convergence and divergence from the classical law of contract, and will also give an insight into comparative legal culture and context in both target countries...|$|R

5000|$|Thomas v. Winchester, 6 N.Y. 397 (1852), which {{established}} the [...] "imminent danger to human life" [...] doctrine, {{was at the}} head of the cases in assaulting the protective wall of <b>privity</b> <b>in</b> the tort field. Subsequent examples include: MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co., Goldberg v. Kollsman Instrument Corp., and finally, Judge Jones's landmark holding in Codling v. Paglia, in which the Court demolished what was left of the <b>privity</b> barrier <b>in</b> tort cases by adopting the doctrine of strict products liability.|$|R
40|$|This Note {{argues that}} the Nebraska Supreme Court missed an {{opportunity}} to reconsider the entrenched common <b>law</b> rule <b>in</b> Nebraska requiring <b>privity</b> <b>in</b> legal malpractice actions. Part II briefly explores the role of <b>privity</b> nationally and <b>in</b> Nebraska, while Part III discusses the facts of Swanson v. Ptak. Part IV explores the implied relationship doctrine, concluding that the harshness of the privity requirement for clients who reasonably relied on what they assumed to be an attorney-client relationship outweighs any benefits it may have to the legal profession...|$|R
50|$|The {{assignment}} {{does not}} necessarily {{have to be in}} writing; however, the assignment agreement must show an intent to transfer rights. The effect of a valid assignment is to extinguish <b>privity</b> (<b>in</b> other words, contractual relationship, including right to sue) between the assignor and the third-party obligor and create privity between the obligor and the assignee.|$|R
50|$|In Australia, it {{has been}} held that {{third-party}} beneficiaries may uphold a promise made for its benefit in a contract of insurance {{to which it is}} not a party (Trident General Insurance Co Ltd v. McNiece Bros Pty Ltd (1988) 165 CLR 107)Austlii. It {{is important to note that}} the decision in Trident had no clear ratio, and did not create a general exemption to the doctrine of <b>privity</b> <b>in</b> Australia.|$|R
40|$|Mutual wills {{are one of}} a {{range of}} {{solutions}} providing for a form of family property <b>in</b> common <b>law</b> jurisprudence. The doctrine of mutual wills also operates in support of contracts for the benefit of third parties. With the settling of the doctrine of <b>privity</b> <b>in</b> 1861, some regard the survival of mutual wills as anomalous. A close analysis of the foundation case for the doctrine, Dufour v Pereira, provides insights into the relationship between probate and equity, and common <b>law</b> and equity, <b>in</b> the late 18 th century. It was a common law solution laced with arguments of the civil law. While the decision was ultimately resolved as a matter of English law, its civil law ‘shadow’ left questions hanging. In the unravelling of those issues within the common <b>law,</b> the developments <b>in</b> equitable doctrine ultimately caught up with the ‘anomaly’. 22 page(s...|$|R
50|$|This issue {{appeared}} repeatedly until MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co. (1916), a case {{analogous to}} Winterbottom v Wright involving a car's defective wheel. Judge Cardozo, {{writing for the}} New York Court of Appeals, decided that no privity is required when the manufacturer knows the product is probably dangerous if defective, third parties (e.g. consumers) will be harmed because of said defect, {{and there was no}} further testing after initial sale. Foreseeable injuries occurred from foreseeable uses. Cardozo's innovation was to decide that the basis for the claim was that it was a tort not a breach of contract. In this way he finessed the problems caused by the doctrine of <b>privity</b> <b>in</b> a modern industrial society. Although his opinion was only <b>law</b> <b>in</b> New York State, the solution he advanced was widely accepted elsewhere and formed the basis of the doctrine of product liability.|$|R

5000|$|A {{contract}} made {{in favor}} of a third party is known as a [...] "third-party beneficiary contract."Under traditional common law, the ius quaesitum tertio principle was not recognized, instead relying on the doctrine of privity of contract, which restricts rights, obligations, and liabilities arising from a contract to the contracting parties (said to be privy to the contract). However, the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 introduced a number of allowances and exceptions for ius quaesitum tertio <b>in</b> English <b>law.</b> Other common-law countries are also making reforms in this area, though the United States is unique <b>in</b> abandoning <b>privity</b> early <b>in</b> the mid-19th century.|$|R

40|$|In the {{products}} liability area the pendulum has now swung {{back to the}} imposition of strict liability.

500|$|It can {{be argued}} {{that this is not a}} true {{exception}} to the doctrine because once the contract is made the [...] "agent" [...] plays no further part, leaving it as an agreement between two parties.

In this situation, the third party can be sued by somebody that he had no idea was involved in the contract.|$|R
