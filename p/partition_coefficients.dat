25|$|The {{partition}} coefficient is defined at a specified temperature and, if applicable, pH of the aqueous phase. <b>Partition</b> <b>coefficients</b> {{are very important}} in pharmacology because they {{determine the extent to}} which a substance can pass from the blood (an aqueous solution) through a cell wall which is like an organic solvent. They are usually measured using water and octanol as the two solvents. Many pharmaceutical compounds are weak acids or weak bases. Such a compound may exist with a different extent of protonation depending on pH and the acid dissociation constant. Because the organic phase has a low dielectric constant the species with no electrical charge will be the most likely one to pass from the aqueous phase to the organic phase. Even at pH7–7.2, the range of biological pH values, the aqueous phase may support an equilibrium between more than one protonated form. logp is determined from the analytical concentration of the substance in the aqueous phase, that is, the sum of the concentration of the different species in equilibrium.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{chemical}} and pharmaceutical sciences, both phases usually are solvents. Most commonly, one of the solvents is water while the second is hydrophobic such as 1-octanol.

2500|$|If {{one of the}} {{solvents}} is a gas and {{the other}} a liquid, a gas/liquid partition coefficient can be determined. [...] For example, the blood/gas partition coefficient of a general anesthetic measures how easily the anesthetic passes from gas to blood. <b>Partition</b> <b>coefficients</b> can also be defined when one of the phases is solid, for instance, when one phase is a molten metal and the second is a solid metal, or when both phases are solids. The partitioning of a substance into a solid results in a solid solution.|$|E
2500|$|Notably, {{solvation}} energy is the free energy needed to transfer a solute molecule from a solvent to vacuum (gas phase). [...] This energy can supplement the intramolecular energy in vacuum calculated in molecular mechanics. [...] Thus, the needed atomic solvation parameters were initially derived from water-gas partition data. However, the dielectric properties of proteins and lipid bilayers {{are much more}} {{similar to those of}} nonpolar solvents than to vacuum. Newer parameters have thus been derived from water-1-octanol <b>partition</b> <b>coefficients</b> or other similar data. [...] Such parameters actually describe transfer energy between two condensed media or the difference of two solvation energies.|$|E
2500|$|Fragment-based: The {{most common}} of these uses a group {{contribution}} method, and is termed ClogP. It {{has been shown}} that the log P of a compound can be determined by the sum of its non-overlapping molecular fragments (defined as one or more atoms covalently bound to each other within the molecule). Fragmentary log P values have been determined in a statistical method analogous to the atomic methods (least squares fitting to a training set). In addition, Hammett type corrections are included to account of electronic and steric effects. [...] This method in general gives better results than atomic based methods, but cannot be used to predict <b>partition</b> <b>coefficients</b> for molecules containing unusual functional groups for which the method has not yet been parameterized (most likely {{because of the lack of}} experimental data for molecules containing such functional groups).|$|E
40|$|The {{history of}} the {{relationship}} of biological activity to <b>partition</b> <b>coefficient</b> and related properties is briefly reviewed. The dominance of <b>partition</b> <b>coefficient</b> in quantitation of structure-activity relationships is emphasized, although the importance of other factors is also demonstrated. Various mathematical models of in vivo transport and binding are discussed; most of these involve partitioning as the primary mechanism of transport. The models describe observed quantitative structureactivity relationships (QSARs) well on the whole, confirming that partitioning is of key importance in in vivo behavior of a xenobiotic. The <b>partition</b> <b>coefficient</b> is shown to correlate with numerous other parameters representing bulk, such as molecular weight, volume and surface area, parachor and calculated indices such as molecular connectivity; this is especially so for apolar molecules, because for polar molecules lipophilicity factors into both bulk and polar or hydrogen bonding components. The relationship of <b>partition</b> <b>coefficient</b> to chromatographic parameters is discussed, and it is shown that such parameters, which are often readily obtainable experimentally, can successfully supplant <b>partition</b> <b>coefficient</b> in QSARs. The relationship of aqueous solubility with <b>partition</b> <b>coefficient</b> is examined in detail. Correlations are observed, even with solid compounds, and these can be used to predict solubility.

50|$|Although the {{distribution}} ratio and <b>partition</b> <b>coefficient</b> {{are often used}} synonymously, they are not necessarily so. Solutes may exist {{in more than one}} form in any particular phase, which would mean that the <b>partition</b> <b>coefficient</b> (Kd) and distribution ratio (D) will have different values. This is an important distinction to make as whilst the <b>partition</b> <b>coefficient</b> has a fixed value for the partitioning of a solute between two phases, {{the distribution}} ratio changes with differing conditions in the solvent.|$|R
2500|$|Atom-based: Standard {{approaches}} of this type, using atomic contributions, {{have been named}} by those formulating them with a prefix letter: AlogP, XlogP, MlogP, etc. A conventional method for predicting log P through this type of method is to parameterize the distribution coefficient contributions of various atoms to the over-all molecular partition coefficient, which produces a parametric model. This parametric model can be estimated using constrained least-squares estimation, using a training set of compounds with experimentally measured <b>partition</b> <b>coefficients.</b> [...] In order to get reasonable correlations, the most common elements contained in drugs (hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen, and halogens) are divided into several different atom types depending on {{the environment of the}} atom within the molecule. [...] While this method is generally the least accurate, the advantage is that it is the most general, being able to provide at least a rough estimate {{for a wide variety of}} molecules.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} noted that wet 1-octanol {{solution}} is a poor approximation of proteins or biological membranes because it contains ~2M of water, and that cyclohexane would be a much better approximation. [...] Investigation of passive permeability barriers for different compounds across lipid bilayers led to conclusion that 1,9-decadiene {{can serve as a}} good approximations of the bilayer interior, whereas 1-octanol was a very poor approximation. [...] A set of solvation parameters derived for protein interior from protein engineering data was also different from octanol scale: it was close to cyclohexane scale for nonpolar atoms but intermediate between cyclohexane and octanol scales for polar atoms. [...] Thus, different atomic solvation parameters should be applied for modeling of protein folding and protein-membrane binding. [...] This issue remains controversial. [...] The original idea of the method was to derive all solvation parameters directly from experimental <b>partition</b> <b>coefficients</b> of organic molecules, which allows calculation of solvation free energy. [...] However, some of the recently developed electrostatic models use ad hoc values of 20 or 40 cal/(Å2 mol) for all types of atoms. The non-existent “hydrophobic” interactions of polar atoms are overridden by large electrostatic energy penalties in such models.|$|E
