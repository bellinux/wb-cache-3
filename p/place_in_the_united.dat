5|$|A {{teaser trailer}} was {{released}} online in September 2000. Universal avoided excessive early marketing to prevent possible backlash, as it believed that {{awareness of the}} film was high enough. Marketing began in April 2001, {{three months before the}} film's release. The first footage from the film was aired during the second-season finale of Survivor in May 2001. Promotional partners included Kodak and The Coca-Cola Company. No fast-food promotions took <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, although kids' meal toys based on the film were offered in Canadian Burger Kings.|$|E

5|$|Mendes was {{approached}} {{to direct the}} film {{after the release of}} Quantum of Solace in 2008. Development was suspended when MGM encountered financial troubles and did not resume until December 2010; during this time, Mendes remained attached to the project as a consultant. The original screenwriter, Peter Morgan, left the project during the suspension. When production resumed, Logan, Purvis, and Wade continued writing what became {{the final version of the}} script. Filming began in November 2011 and primarily took <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom, with smaller portions shot in China and Turkey.|$|E

5|$|After a {{successful}} first contest, the second faced several location problems. The event originally {{should have been}} organised by British broadcaster ITV in Manchester. ITV then announced that due to financial and scheduling reasons, the contest would not take <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom after all. It is also thought that another factor to their decision was the previous years' audience ratings for ITV which were below the expected amount. The EBU approached Croatian broadcaster HRT, who had won the previous contest, to stage the event in Zagreb; though it later emerged that HRT had 'forgotten' to book the venue in which the contest would have taken place. It was at this point, with five months remaining until the event would be held, that Norwegian broadcaster NRK stepped in to host the contest in Lillehammer.|$|E
5|$|Greyhounds were {{introduced}} in the Americas for sport and pleasure, they helped farmers control jackrabbits, and organised coursing meets were taking <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States in the 19th century, by 1886 according to Gulf Coast Greyhounds. Open field coursing of jackrabbits, which {{are members of the}} hare family, now takes place {{in a number of states}} in Western America, including California, Montana and Wyoming, and is said by the North American Coursing Association to take place also in Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah. It takes place with up to four dogs chasing the hare.|$|E

The sequel is set to be released on 16 November 2018, followed by the third on 20 November 2020. In July 2016, David Yates confirmed that Rowling had written the screenplay for the second film and has ideas for the third. In October 2016, Rowling confirmed that the series would comprise five films. In November 2016 it was confirmed that Johnny Depp will have a starring role in the sequel, reprising his role as Gellert Grindelwald. In April 2017, it was confirmed that Jude Law had been cast for the role of Albus Dumbledore at around the time he was the Transfiguration professor at Hogwarts.

5|$|It is {{uncertain}} how Bruce was employed {{after his return}} from Spitsbergen in autumn 1899. In his whole life he rarely had settled salaried work, and usually relied on patronage or on influential acquaintances to find him temporary posts. Early in 1901 he evidently felt sufficiently confident of his prospects to get married. His bride was Jessie Mackenzie, who {{had worked as a}} nurse in Samuel Bruce's London surgery. Bruce's marriage took <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Free Church of Scotland, in Chapelhill within the Parish of Nigg on 20 January 1901, being attended and witnessed by their parents. Perhaps, due to Bruce's secretive nature presenting limited details even among his circle of close friends and colleagues, little information about the wedding has been recorded by his biographers.|$|E
5|$|The {{video game}} Parasite Eve {{is based on}} the {{acclaimed}} Japanese novel Parasite Eve released in 1995. Plot-wise, the video game serves as a sequel to the book. The game was produced by Hironobu Sakaguchi and directed by Takashi Tokita of Square. During development of the game, Square decided to use New York City as the setting after having been previously considered for use in Final Fantasy VII. The game is notable for being Square's first game to be rated Mature by the ESRB. In contrast to previous Square titles, the development team for Parasite Eve consisted of both Japanese and American staff members, with {{a large part of the}} production taking <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States. Different concepts for the games opening were considered, including different designs for Aya and Melissa transforming into Eve on stage during the opera. Book author Hideaki Sena did not know the titles' plot until it was completed, since the game was a collaboration between Square and his publisher.|$|E
5|$|All these {{achievements}} were {{a prelude}} to the 1927 Wimbledon Championships where in successive rounds Cochet defeated two leading Americans Frank Hunter and Bill Tilden and finally Jean Borotra in remarkable five set matches, {{all of whom had}} a two-sets advantage against him. Tilden served for the match, leading 5–1 in the third set and had a match ball. In the final Borotra left six match points unconverted to open the route for Cochet's revival. With the latter one Cochet set a Wimbledon final comeback record that stands up to this day. He then again met Hunter and Tilden in the final of the doubles, this time he joining forces with Jacques Brugnon and lost the championship despite having a match point. This was the first of three consecutive encounters between the French and American teams as in early September the 1927 Davis Cup final took <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States where the US Davis Cup team led by Tilden and Hunter faced the challenging team of the Musketeers. France won 3–2 with Cochet victorious in the decider against Bill Johnston and reclaiming the Davis Cup for France the first time since 1920. A couple of days later the French troupe went to compete in the U.S. National Championships at the West Side Tennis Club in New York. Cochet and Eileen Bennett became the mixed doubles champions. When he returned home {{in the first week of}} October Cochet took revenge on Christian Boussus in their second meeting in the final of the Coupe Porée of Paris. The same week he was ranked third in the world for the second consecutive year although this time he finished ahead of compatriot Borotra. In November he won the Swiss Covered Courts Internationals in a short twenty-five-minute final against Donald Greig.|$|E
