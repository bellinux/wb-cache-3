5|$|Ann Eliza Bleecker's <b>pastoral</b> poems {{exemplified}} a {{new style}} of American poetry, and, due to her experience of the American Revolutionary tumult, {{a new sense of}} national identity. These poems, written in the <b>pastoral</b> tradition, conveyed both the beauty of the colonial New York countryside and the horrific impact of war, suffering, death, and destruction. Because Bleecker was writing from the interesting perspective of a terrified young mother, her articulate depictions of the Revolutionary War are still read by historians today.|$|E

5000|$|He {{was born}} in Shropshire of a Leicestershire family. He was educated at Shrewsbury School and St John's College, Cambridge, of which he became a fellow in 1699. He seems to have lived chiefly at Cambridge until he {{resigned}} his fellowship in 1708, and his <b>pastorals</b> were probably written in this period. He worked for Jacob Tonson the bookseller, and his <b>Pastorals</b> opened the sixth volume of Tonson's Miscellanies (1709), which also contained the <b>pastorals</b> of Alexander Pope. The term [...] "namby-pamby", meaning something that is excessively sentimental, comes from his name.|$|R

5|$|But reform {{brought with}} it new ways of {{thinking}} about the church and its personnel, derived not only from contemporary continental movements but also from the rich <b>pastoral</b> and canonical literature of the Carolingian renaissance. This disseminated ideas concerning the separation of the lay and religious spheres, the distinction between monks and clergy, and enhanced the authority of bishops as both <b>pastoral</b> and political leaders. Ultimately, these ideas were to strike at deeply entrenched features of the early medieval church, such as hereditary control of churches and the right of the clergy to marry.|$|E

5|$|The M.A. {{concentration}} in <b>Pastoral</b> Care and Counseling {{can serve as}} an excellent path of study for those who support {{the life of the}} congregation, desire a career in <b>pastoral</b> counseling in a non-profit agency, or who envision chaplaincy – in fields such as health care, corrections, community or the military – as an expression of their call to ministry.|$|E
5|$|These benefices {{provided}} an income without {{the obligation to}} perform any <b>pastoral</b> services.

Walter remained as a teacher and official at Orléans, perhaps without returning to Scotland at all, until the late 1350s, by when he would have been absent from his native country for more than 25years.

5|$|Academic {{standards}} are high: 93% of GCSE students attain A*-C grades; {{there is a}} 100% pass rate at A-Level; and 100% of A-Level leavers take up places at universities (10% to Oxbridge) or on gap year schemes. The school's most recent inspection rated much of the education and <b>pastoral</b> provision as 'outstanding'.|$|E
5|$|According to Richard Maxwell Eaton, {{author of}} A Social History of the Deccan, Vithoba was first worshipped as a <b>pastoral</b> god {{as early as}} the 6th century. Vithoba's arms-akimbo {{iconography}} is similar to Bir Kuar, the cattle-god of the Ahirs of Bihar, who is now also associated with Krishna. Vithoba was probably later assimilated into the Shaiva pantheon and identified with the god Shiva, like most other <b>pastoral</b> gods. This is backed by the facts that the temple at Pandharpur is surrounded by Shaiva temples (most notably of the devotee Pundalik himself), and that Vithoba is crowned with the Linga, symbol of Shiva. However, since the 13th century, the poet-saints like Namdev, Eknath and Tukaram identified Vithoba with Vishnu.|$|E
5|$|Bleecker's <b>pastoral</b> {{poetry is}} studied by historians to gain {{perspective}} {{of life on}} the front lines of the revolution, and her novel Maria Kittle, the first known Captivity novel, set the form for subsequent Indian Capture novels which saw great popularity after her death.|$|E

Britannia's <b>Pastorals</b> was never finished: in his lifetime Books I & II were published successively in 1613 and 1616. The manuscript of Book III (unfinished) was not published until 1852.
