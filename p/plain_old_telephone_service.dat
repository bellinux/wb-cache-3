25|$|Access network: The {{user can}} {{connect to the}} IP-core of NGN in various ways, most of which use the {{standard}} Internet Protocol (IP). User terminals such as mobile phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs) and computers can register directly on NGN-core, {{even when they are}} roaming in another network or country. The only requirement is that they can use IP and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). Fixed access (e.g., Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), cable modems, Ethernet), mobile access (e.g. W-CDMA, CDMA2000, GSM, GPRS) and wireless access (e.g.WLAN, WiMAX) are all supported. Other phone systems like <b>plain</b> <b>old</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>service</b> and non-compatible VoIP systems, are supported through gateways. With the deployment of the NGN, users may subscribe to many simultaneous access-providers providing telephony, internet or entertainment services. This may provide end-users with virtually unlimited options to choose between service providers for these services in NGN environment.|$|E

50|$|Access is {{essential}} to the future profitability of operators who are experiencing massive reductions in revenue from <b>plain</b> <b>old</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>services,</b> {{due in part to the}} opening of historically nationalized companies to competition, and in part to increased use of mobile phones and voice over IP (VoIP) services. Operators offered additional services such as xDSL based broadband and IPTV (Internet Protocol Television) to guarantee profit. The access network is again the main barrier to achieving these profits since operators worldwide have accurate records of only 40% to 60% of the network. Without understanding or even knowing the characteristics of these enormous copper spider webs, it is very difficult, and expensive to 'provision' (connect) new customers and assure the data rates required to receive next generation services.|$|R

40|$|CSELT is {{evaluating}} {{the feasibility of}} provisioning Telephony over IP (ToIP) services. ToIP is different from Voice over IP, because it is intended as a Carrier-class service, fully featured and with quality of service guarantees, to be offered to {{a large number of}} users, either overlapping or substituting classical <b>Plain</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Telephone</b> <b>Services.</b> CSELT is performing both theoretical and experimental analysis; in particular we are focusing our work on the mechanisms and protocols developed in the standardisation bodies in order to verify how the telephony services can be supported by means of an IP network. In the first half of 2000 we have performed a laboratory trial in order to demonstrate the "proof-of-concept" of ToIP capabilities, performance and interoperability with TDM-based switching technology. In the solution tested in CSELT, provided by a leading manufacturer, the IP technology is deployed in the transit network, so it is necessary to have an interworking function between a traditional circuit network and the IP network. It must be underlined that the solution provided by the manufacturer, as requested by CSELT, was still at an early stage of development, hence it has not been possible to perform a full test campaign. From our theoretical analysis and laboratory experiment we observed the suitability of architectures proposed in the standardisation bodies and by the manufacturers for the provisioning of ToIP services. The experimented system, in particular considering its prototype nature, has shown high performance in terms both of voice and signalling quality. The main problem that arises in ToIP systems is the reliability of the system, that is a fundamental concept for providing carrier-class services. The detailed results of both the theoretical analysis and the laboratory experiment are presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to propose an approach for single-ended loop characterization by which the insertion loss (IL) over a subscriber loop can be estimated to within ± 1 dB accuracy based on some measurements from the central office (CO) only. The estimation of transmission loss at 1 kHz is an essential requirement for both basic <b>plain</b> <b>old</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>services</b> (POTS) and special <b>services</b> provided by <b>telephone</b> companies (telcos). The loss at 1 kHz is used as an indication {{of the quality of the}} connection. To maintain the quality (loss) of the subscriber loops at a certain level, skilled technicians are conventionally needed to perform two-ended loss measurements at both the customer end and the central office. The latest methods used in the industry require large but unreliable data base. These result in substantial expenses to telephone companies. Our objective is to replace these by an automatic procedure. Estimation of the loop loss based on measurements from the Central Office only is complicated by the fact that the customer's terminal set may be one of a wide variety of terminations and will not, in general, be known to the operating companies. The approach proposed in this thesis is intended for voice band special services for Carrier Serving Area (CSA) loops in digital loop carrier (DLC) systems. The problem is formulated as that of modelling a two port network using single port measurements. The parameters of the model representing the subscriber loop are determined so as to minimize the input impedance error at several frequencies for arbitrary customer's termination. It is shown that using this model for insertion loss estimation results in errors within the required 1 dB at 1 kHz. Next, a simple algorithm is proposed to use the same parameters in the model to determine insertion loss at higher voice frequencies. Finally, effect of error in input impedance measurement on loss estimation is studied...|$|R
40|$|The {{authors and}} other members of their group have already written some papers and {{research}} reports on specifying telephone call processing in LOTOS. Two such papers, where two differently organized specifications of the <b>Plain</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Telephone</b> System <b>service</b> (POTS) were presented, were [FLS 90][FLS 91]. The specification in the second paper was mainly in the constraint-oriented style, while the one in the first was in a combination of constraint-oriented and state-oriented style. We are now presenting yet another style of specifying telephone systems, because we feel that this new style has some definite advantages over the ones used in previous papers. In particular: 1. In the previous specifications, the identification of busy telephone numbers was done by including such numbers in a set; in this specification, busy telephones directly inform others of their state by offering the busy action only. 2. While in previous specifications a disconnection caused all the components of the connection (the two stations and the controller) to end up in a deadlock and thus to become “dead ” and nonreusable, in this specification these components go back to initial state and are reusable in another connection. 3. Resource- oriented style: specification modules more closely model software entities such a...|$|R
