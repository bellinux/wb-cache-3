A comparison between bi-metallic <b>core</b> <b>pin</b> with that of tool steel revealed that bi-metallic <b>core</b> <b>pin</b> performed better in terms of soldering under HPDC environment. Due to slow cooling, die holding time needed to be increased in tool steel <b>core</b> <b>pin</b> to allow sufficient solidification of the casting part. The bi-metallic <b>core</b> <b>pins</b> also operated without any catastrophic failure in the clad which particularly substantiated the applicability of DMD deposited tool steel clad on copper alloy substrate to manufacture bi-metallic tooling...|$|R
40|$|Soldering of <b>core</b> <b>pins</b> {{is one of}} {{the major}} issues {{limiting}} the productivity of aluminum castings using high pressure die casting process. This issue is associated with the failure of the ceramic coating, chemical reactions between the molten aluminum and the matrix metal and the dissolution of the pin matrix metal. Methods that prevent coating failure, retard dissolution rates of the <b>core</b> <b>pin</b> materials in molten aluminum can be used for reducing soldering tendency of <b>core</b> <b>pins.</b> As a result, a ceramic coating is usually applied to the <b>core</b> <b>pins</b> in order to reduce soldering tendency, because the coating prevents severe reactions between the <b>core</b> <b>pin</b> material and the molten alloy. Therefore, the coating lifetime governs the soldering process and the <b>core</b> <b>pin</b> lifetime. The purpose of this study is 1) the mechanism of soldering formation, 2) the performance of coatings when contacting with molten alloys, 3) the in-depth analysis of the starting up coating failure, and 4) an ultrasonic method that is used for accelerating testing processes. ^ Results show that the soldering process starts from a local coating failure, involves a series of intermetallic phase formations from reactions between molten aluminum alloys and the H 13 steel pin, and accelerates when the aluminum-rich phase is formed between the intermetallic phases. It is the formation of the aluminum-rich phase in the reaction region that joins the <b>core</b> <b>pin</b> with the casting, resulting in the sticking of the casting to the <b>core</b> <b>pin.</b> When undercuts are formed on the <b>core</b> <b>pin,</b> the ejection of castings from the die will either lead to a <b>core</b> <b>pin</b> failure or damages to the casting be ejected. High intensity ultrasonic vibration was applied on H 13 coupons to accelerate the experiments. Results obtained using the accelerated testing method were then validated using in a high pressure die casting machine under production conditions. These results indicate that coating detachment from the steel substrate is the main failure mechanism of the coatings when tested in water, oil, molten salt, or molten zinc at low temperatures. Coating failure accelerates as the temperature of the melt is increased. At high temperatures, coating fragmentation, as well as detachments, occurs on coupons tested in molten salt. Therefore, the coverage percentage and quality of coatings play an important role in retarding coating failure. As soon as coating failure occurs, the dissolution rate of H 13 steel is extremely high. The affinity, between the <b>core</b> <b>pin</b> material and the molten alloy, plays an important role in the later soldering process. The dissolution rate of H 13 steel in molten zinc is much higher than that in molten A 380 at the same experiment conditions. The dissolution rate of niobium in molten aluminum is at least 300 times slower than that of H 13 steels. It is suggested that Nb alloys have good potential to be used as soldering resistant <b>core</b> <b>pin</b> materials. ...|$|R

40|$|During high {{pressure}} die casting (HPDC) of aluminium alloys {{there is a tendency}} for the molten alloy to react with the steel die, <b>core</b> <b>pins</b> and inserts. This occurrence within the HPDC industry is referred to as ‘soldering’. This is of concern to {{high pressure}} die casters because of down-time, due to regular removal of the soldering, reduced die life and degradation of casting quality. The reaction between the tool steel (usually H 13) and the molten aluminium involves inter-diffusion and the formation of intermetallic phases. To remove this problem the possibility exists of applying a surface treatment to act as a barrier between molten alloy and the die. During the course of this research project several surface treatments were investigated namely PVD (TiN, CrN, TiCN), Duplex PVD (TiN, CrN, TiCN) and Gas Nitriding for soldering prevention during HPDC with aluminium alloy, and their results are compared to uncoated <b>core</b> <b>pins.</b> The coating selection criterion was based on commercial availability of surface treatments in Australia and suitability of coating properties with H 13 tool steel used in molten aluminium alloy (ADC- 12). One of the most important findings made during these experiments was the distinction and characterization of build-up on the surface of PVD coatings. It was found that build-up did not necessarily represent formation of intermetallics (soldering) for PVD surface engineered <b>core</b> <b>pins.</b> It addition build-up did not grow in thickness as previously thought and that build-up was influenced by high fluid flow and temperature during HPDC. The characterization of build-up was a fundamental important step in prolonging the performance of PVD surface engineered <b>core</b> <b>pins</b> in HPDC. The experimental results were confirmed by conducting in-plant HPDC trials at Nissan Casting Plant Pty Ltd Australia. The results demonstrate that PVD coatings can improve the resistance to soldering compared to conventional nitrided and un-coated <b>core</b> <b>pins</b> and the need for polishing was eliminated. Knowledge gained during this research program was transferred to NCAP and a guideline for using PVD coatings in HPDC was prepared. A seminar on PVD coating for HPDC was also given to the Australian die casting industry organized by the Australian Die Casting Association (ADCA) ...|$|R

This occurrence within the high pressure die casting (HPDC) industry is referred to as ‘soldering’. It is of concern to high-pressure die casters because of down-time due to the regular removal of the soldered layer and its detrimental affect on die life and casting quality. In this investigation, several physical vapour deposited (PVD) coatings, namely, TiN, CrN and TiCN, were evaluated for their ability to eliminate soldering during HPDC of aluminium alloys. Accelerated semi-industrial trials were carried out in a 250 -t Toshiba HPDC machine using a specially designed die made of P 20 tool steel with removable <b>core</b> <b>pins.</b> The results from these trials showed that PVD coatings can act as a physical barrier coating preventing any reaction between the molten aluminium alloy and the tool steel. Thus the problem of soldering on such tools as <b>core</b> <b>pins</b> can be eliminated in high HPDC of aluminium alloys. In the accelerated trials, it was found that soldering was replaced by a built-up layer of cast aluminium alloy, which was less detrimental to tool life and reduced machine down-time due to the reduced need for tool polishing. The experimental results were confirmed by conducting in-plant HPDC trials...|$|R

40|$|The {{nanostructure}} {{and magnetic}} properties of polycrystalline MgCNi_ 3 were studied by x-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, and vibrating sample magnetometry. While the bulk flux-pinning force curve F_p(H) indicates the expected grain-boundary pinning mechanism just below T_c = 7. 2 K, a systematic change to pinning by a nanometer-scale distribution of <b>core</b> <b>pinning</b> sites {{is indicated by}} a shift of F_p(H) with decreasing temperature. The lack of scaling of F_p(H) suggests the presence of 10 to 20 % of nonsuperconducting regions inside the grains, which are smaller than the diameter of fluxon cores 2 xi at high temperature and become effective with decreasing temperature when xi(T) approaches the nanostructural scale. Transmission electron microscopy revealed cubic and graphite nanoprecipitates with 2 to 5 nm size, consistent with the above hypothesis since xi(0) = 6 nm. High critical current densities, more than 10 ^ 6 A/cm^ 2 at 1 T and 4. 2 K, were obtained for grain colonies separated by carbon. Dirty-limit behavior seen in previous studies may be tied to electron scattering by the precipitates, indicating the possibility that strong <b>core</b> <b>pinning</b> might be combined with a technologically useful upper critical field if versions of MgCNi_ 3 with higher T_c can be found.
