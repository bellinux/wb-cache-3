5|$|After {{being trapped}} in the harbour {{for more than a}} year, Great Britain was at last floated out in December 1844, but not before causing more anxiety for her proprietors. After passing {{successfully}} through the first set of lock gates, she jammed on her passage through the second, which led to the River Avon. Only the seamanship of Captain Claxton (who after Naval service held the position of Quay Warden (Harbour Master) at Bristol) enabled her to be <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> severe structural damage avoided. The following day an army of workmen, under the direct control of Brunel, took advantage of the slightly higher tide and removed coping stones and lock gate platforms from the Junction Lock, allowing the tug Samson, again under Claxton's supervision, to tow the ship safely into the Avon that midnight.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{the allies}} {{managed to take}} {{possession}} over Jutland and the Swedish commander Philip of Sulzbach was forced into {{a long series of}} retreats. On May 19, 1659, the Swedes abandoned their last positions at Fredriksodde and took up positions at Funen. Less than two weeks later, on May 31, 1659 the first allied assault on Funen began with 9,000 soldiers. Against them stood 4,000 Swedes, considerably fewer, but consisting of battle-hardened veterans. The first attack was duly repelled. On June 26, a second attempt was made: the allies landed after heavy fire had pounded what was thought to be the Swedish positions. However, the Swedes had <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> returned unscathed with heavy fire of their own. The invaders were again thrown back. Before a third attempt could be made, a Swedish naval squadron under Owen Coxe managed to sink a large number of the invading fleet at the naval battle of Ebeltoft, and took 1,000 prisoners. In the end the allies had not succeeded to invade Funen, and a decision was taken to instead go back and attack Swedish Pomerania.|$|E

5|$|The low foot {{to lower}} leg ratio in Deinonychus is due partly to an unusually short {{metatarsus}} (upper foot bones). The ratio is actually larger in smaller individuals than in larger ones. Ostrom {{suggested that the}} short metatarsus {{may be related to}} the function of the sickle claw, and used the fact that it appears to get shorter as individuals aged as support for this. He interpreted all these features– the short second toe with enlarged claw, short metatarsus, etc.– as support for the use of the hind leg as an offensive weapon, where the sickle claw would strike downwards and backwards, and the leg <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> down at the same time, slashing and tearing at the prey. Ostrom suggested that the short metatarsus reduced overall stress on the leg bones during such an attack, and interpreted the unusual arrangement of muscle attachments in the Deinonychus leg as support for his idea that a different set of muscles was used in the predatory stroke than in walking or running. Therefore, Ostrom concluded that the legs of Deinonychus represented a balance between running adaptations needed for an agile predator, and stress-reducing features to compensate for its unique foot weapon.|$|E
5|$|Ethalion {{took over}} pursuit of Bellone from Melampus, {{and for two}} hours {{maintained}} continuous fire with her bow-chasers on the French ship. Ethalion was faster than her quarry, and she slowly pulled parallel with Bellone during the afternoon, but could not get close enough for a decisive blow. It took another two hours of pursuit before the battered Bellone eventually surrendered. Hoche apart, Bellone had suffered more casualties than any other ship present. To the south of this conflict, the struggling Anson discovered herself in danger when the surviving frigates of the French vanguard swept towards her en masse. Captain Durham was initially confused by their approach {{as he had been}} too distant to witness the action and the French ships flew false British ensigns, but he rapidly realised their true identity and at 16:00 opened fire on Loire. The damaged Anson was severely hampered by her inability to manoeuvre, and so could do nothing when the French ships <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> sailed away, except to continue to fire until they were out of range. During the evening, the surviving French frigates gradually pulled away from their pursuers and disappeared into the gathering night, leaving behind four of their squadron, including their flagship, as captives.|$|E

25|$|Most membranophones are drums. Hornbostel-Sachs divides drums {{into three}} main types: struck drums, where {{the skin is}} hit with a stick, the hand, or {{something}} else; string drums, where a knotted string attached to the drum's skin is pulled, passing its vibrations onto the skin; and friction drums, where some sort of rubbing motion causes the skin to vibrate (a common type has a stick passing {{through a hole in}} the skin which is <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> forth).|$|E

One attempt by Johnston to act decisively in the offensive, during the Battle of Cassville, ironically was foiled by Hood, who had been ordered to attack the flank of one column of Sherman's army, but instead <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> entrenched when confronted by the unexpected arrival of a small detachment of that column.|$|E

25|$|On 12 April, Bonaparte's French army {{defeated}} Argenteau's {{soldiers at}} the Battle of Montenotte. While Laharpe mounted a frontal attack with 7,000 troops from Monte Negino, Masséna moved north with 4,000 men to turn Argenteau's weak right flank. Meanwhile, 11,000 more troops were moved {{up behind the}} striking forces. Masséna's flanking movement broke through and Argenteau's efforts to plug the gap failed. The Austrian <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> the French mauled his outnumbered force. Argenteau withdrew his battered force to Dego, complaining that he could rally only 700 men to the colors.|$|E

25|$|Unfortunately for the Germans, {{during their}} retreat earlier that autumn they had {{destroyed}} the Losheim-Losheimergraben road {{bridge over the}} railway.

A railroad overpass they had selected as an alternative route could not bear the weight of the German armor. Peiper instead directed his lead tank to cross the railroad and climb the embankment, but as soon as it reached the top on the far side, Peiper received new orders directing him west along the road through Lanzerath to Bucholz Station. He <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> headed for Lanzerath instead.|$|E

25|$|Galatea {{sent her}} boats {{under the command}} of her first {{lieutenant}} William Coombe, together with Lieutenants Harry Walker and Robert Gibson, Master's Mates John Green and Barry Sarsfield, 50 seamen and 20 marines. The boat crews rowed about 35 miles in eight hours, some of it in the blazing sun, before they were able to catch up with their quarry. The British tried to board twice, but her guns repelled them. The boats then <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> poured musket and small arms fire through the stern and quarter ports. This had the effect of clearing many of the enemy from her decks, including the captain and most of his officers. The British then were able to board on their third attempt. There they still faced a fight as the vessel's crew outnumbered the attackers.|$|E
25|$|Seeing {{that a small}} {{wood was}} the key to the position, Marmont {{organized}} a general attack. He sent the 113th Line Infantry forward deployed in skirmish order. Assisted by a horse artillery battery from I Cavalry Corps and a lancer squadron under Cyrille-Simon Picquet, Ricard's division captured Baye. Lagrange attacked between Baye and Bannay. Ney's divisions began to arrive and his guns pounded Bannay. Bordesoulle's cavalry on the right and Jean-Pierre Doumerc's on the left began edging around the Russian flanks. The 7th Battalion of the 4th Light Infantry were the first French troops to occupy Baye while Pelleport's brigade took Bannay. Olsufiev <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> established a new line at the Andecy Farm. As French cavalry began to envelop both flanks, the Russian withdrew again toward Champaubert.|$|E
25|$|Australia and {{the rest}} of Task Force 44 were removed from patrol duties on 10 January 1943; no Japanese {{aircraft}} or ships were sighted during the three months on station. Task Force 44 was <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> split into smaller groups: two rapid response forces, and a third (made up of Australia and three American destroyers) sent to Moreton Bay for exercises. In early February, Australias group sailed to Sydney, where the cruiser was fitted with a new radar, then proceeded on 17 February to meet the convoy returning the 9th Division from the Middle East. The convoy arrived in Fremantle on 18 February, then sailed for the Great Australian Bight, where Australia and her escorts met them. The ships reached Sydney on 27 February without incident, and Australia and her destroyers returned to northern waters.|$|E

25|$|When the taxi-borne German force {{reached the}} {{farmstead}} of Li {{on the road}} to Dombås, they ran into two truck-loads of soldiers from No. 5 Company, IR 11. After some initial confusion the Norwegian opened fire and the Germans charged with submachine guns and hand grenades. Following a short fire fight during which Schmidt was severely wounded and the Norwegians pushed back, the paratroopers abandoned their advance on Dombås. They instead <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> took up positions in a hedgehog defensive fighting position at the farms of Ulekleiv and Hagevolden, covering all directions and dominating the surrounding landscape. Schmidt—although seriously wounded in the hip and stomach—never relinquished command and ordered his men to use sand to write messages in the snow to the Luftwaffe asking for supplies of provisions and ammunition. The force was not spotted by Luftwaffe reconnaissance aircraft and received no supply drops while at Ulekleiv/Hagevolden.|$|E
25|$|The {{effectiveness}} of U.S. maneuver forces was limited by narrow trails that funneled attacking companies into squad or platoon points of attack, where they encountered PAVN platoons and companies with prepared fields of fire. With most small arms engagements thus conducted at close range, U.S. fire support was also severely restricted. Units frequently <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> called in artillery fire, close air support, and aerial rocket artillery, but the North Vietnamese bunkers were well-sited and constructed with overhead cover to withstand bombardment. During {{the course of}} the battle the foliage was eventually stripped away and the bunkers exposed, but they were so numerous and well constructed that many could not be destroyed by indirect fire. Napalm, recoilless rifle fire, and dogged squad and platoon-level actions eventually accounted for the reduction of most fortifications, though at a pace and price thoroughly unanticipated by American forces.|$|E
