40|$|Whistleblowing by {{administrative}} {{employees in}} local governments can bring critical knowledge about misconduct and failed policy outcomes and priorities {{to the attention}} of <b>politicians.</b> This article examines whether (1) whistleblowing to <b>politicians</b> is considered acceptable among <b>politicians</b> and administrative employees, (2) <b>politicians</b> receive whistleblowing cases and how those who do so handle the case, and (3) contact patterns between <b>politicians</b> and administrative employees influence the whistleblowing activity and the action taken by the <b>politicians</b> to address wrongdoing. The article departs from the theory of pillars of institutions and the tensions between and within institutional pillars to analyse unique data from a survey based on the vignette method and actual whistleblowing among <b>politicians</b> (N[*]=[*] 400) and employees (N[*]=[*] 373) from 20 Norwegian municipalities. The analysis shows that the degree of contact between <b>politicians</b> and administrative employees is correlated with positive perceptions of whistleblowing and constructive handling of wrongdoing reports by the <b>politicians...</b>|$|R

40|$|A rare {{collection}} of personality assessments from 103 Italian <b>politicians</b> revealed predictable patterns of contrasts and similarities with personality dimensions {{from a large}} normative sample (N = 4, 578). Three modal personality characteristics distinguished <b>politicians,</b> with their significantly higher levels of. Energy, Agreeableness, and Social Desirability, from the general public. Comparability between <b>politicians</b> and the public existed on dimensions of Emotional Stability, Conscientiousness, and Openness (Big Five Questionnaire assessment). <b>Politicians</b> from rival coalitions differed on several dimensions; center-right was higher than center-left in Energy and Conscientiousness. Congruencies emerged between <b>politicians</b> and voters for their coalition on all personality dimensions, except that center-left <b>politicians</b> were higher in Energy than center-left voters, and center-right <b>politicians</b> were higher than voters in both Energy and Agreeableness...|$|R
40|$|Popularity is coveted by <b>politicians</b> before general election. <b>Politicians</b> {{who have}} high {{popularity}} {{have a much}} larger capital to be successfully elected in general election. In contrast, ordinary or even low popularity {{will be difficult for}} <b>politicians</b> to win public institution seats contested. The problem is about how to increase the popularity for <b>politicians.</b> This paper discusses about relationship between the popularity of <b>politicians</b> with political work and the greatness of television, whether {{it is true that the}} increase in popularity of <b>politicians</b> can only be done with political work, or in the contrary, the increase in the popularity of <b>politicians</b> can be done with the use of television media, as the media are most widely used in the community. Discussion of this paper was done using literature study obtained from political communication and mass communication books related to this matter. In addition, data from recent news media, especially regarding the popularity of the <b>politicians,</b> political work and the use of television media in general elections were also used to enrich this paper. Result of this literature study concludes that popularity of the <b>politicians</b> has become a major requirement for <b>politicians</b> to succeed in general election. Popularity of the <b>politicians</b> is synonymous with political work. Political work done continuously in approaching the constituent is the way to boost the popularity. Nevertheless, the political work is not enough. Currently, efforts to boost popularity needs mass media, especially television, which can introduce <b>politicians</b> to their constituents who are also the television audience.  </p...|$|R

40|$|I {{examine whether}} stock {{ownership}} by <b>politicians</b> helps to enforce noncontractible {{quid pro quo}} relations with firms. The ownership by US Congress members in firms contributing to their election campaigns is higher than in noncontributors. This bias toward contributors depends on the financial incentives of <b>politicians</b> and the relation's value. Firms with a stronger ownership-contribution association receive more government contracts. The financial gains from these contracts are economically large. When <b>politicians</b> divest stocks, firms discontinue contributions to the <b>politicians,</b> lose future contracts, and perform poorly. <b>Politicians</b> divest the stocks in contributors, but not in noncontributors, in anticipation of retirement...|$|R
