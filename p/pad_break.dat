50|$|This {{variation}} {{looks to}} be better than the wet-nanoFET as it has none of the liquid based problems of the wet-nanoFET. Unfortunately, not much information has been released on how it manages to transport particles to the charging pad. Once at the charging pad, it uses a piezoelectric layer to get the particles moving and to get them off the charging <b>pad.</b> This <b>breaks</b> the adhesion force and severely reduces their attraction to the charging pad, allowing the acceleration grid to start pulling them out.|$|R

25|$|According to Ashley Mallett's {{biography}} of Ian Chappell, Chappelli Speaks Out, Bill Lawry was considering selecting Jordon {{to play in}} the fourth test instead of Taber because of the former's superior batting. Chappell said he would not play in the side if Jordon was picked because the wicketkeeper was a cheat. This was based on an incident during a game on the recent Indian tour when Australia was playing South Zone. E. A. S. Prasanna was facing Alan Connolly with Jordon standing up to the stumps – he appeared to miss the ball and his off stump was knocked forward. Jordon appealed and Prasanna eventually walked but Chappell believed the ball had missed Prasanna's stumps and rebounded off Jordon's <b>pads</b> to <b>break</b> the wicket – and that Jordon knew this.|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] - During braking process {{kinetic energy}} is {{converted}} into heat energy {{and it should}} be removed from the breaking system for proper functioning. The heat generated is due to the friction between the disc brake rotor and <b>breaking</b> <b>pad.</b> For obtaining a good and efficient braking system the knowledge of maximum heat generated in the system and also proper ventilation methods are needed. This paper investigates the temperature field around a disc brake suitable for an all-terrain vehicle. The analysis is done in commercially available ANSYS software and the results are found to be satisfactory. I...|$|R
5000|$|During the 2008 {{political}} crisis, armed masked PAD forces {{broke into}} the government-owned National Broadcasting Service of Thailand and seized control of the television station. The television broadcast of the morning news program briefly showed pictures of <b>PAD</b> forces <b>breaking</b> into {{the gates of the}} station before blacking out for several hours. NBT employees were threatened with violence and forced out of the station. Police eventually regained control of the building and arrested 80 of the raiders, seizing guns, knives, golf clubs, and drugs. The raiders were charged with causing damage to public property and illegal possession of weapons and drugs. Later in the same day, hundreds of hundreds of PAD members, led by Amorn Amornrattananon, again seized the NBST station. Police eventually regained control of the station. [...] The Southeast Asian Press Alliance and the Thai Journalists Association condemned what it called the [...] "mob attack" [...] on the station, and noted that the unjustifiable and went against the principles of democracy, free flow of information, and fair play that the PAD themselves have claimed to justify their illegal act.|$|R

50|$|Defibrillation {{threshold}} {{indicates the}} {{minimum amount of}} energy needed to return normal rhythm to a heart that is beating in a cardiac dysrhythmia. Typical examples are the minimum amount of energy, expressed in joules, delivered by external defibrillator paddles or <b>pads,</b> required to <b>break</b> atrial fibrillation and restore normal sinus rhythm. Other common scenarios are restoring normal rhythm from atrial flutter, ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation.The defibrillation threshold ranking in these settings, from lowest to highest, would be, in order, ventricular tachycardia, atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, ventricular fibrillation. The highest amount of energy that an external defibrillator can deliver {{at the present time}} is 360 joules biphasic. In clinical practice, the real threshold can be approximated but not exactly established, since the defibrillating shock can be delivered only once. Certain medications, in particular sotalol, tend to lower such threshold, while others, such as amiodarone, may increase it.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Low-latency {{anonymous}} {{communication protocols}} in general, {{and the popular}} onion-routing protocol in particular, are broken against simple timing attacks. While {{there have been few}} proposed solutions to this problem when the adversary is active, several padding schemes have been proposed to defend against a passive adversary that just observes timing patterns. Unfortunately active adversaries can <b>break</b> <b>padding</b> schemes by inserting delays and dropping messages. We present a protocol that provides anonymity against an active adversary by using a black-box padding scheme that is effective against a passive adversary. Our protocol reduces, in some sense, providing anonymous communication against active attacks to providing a padding scheme against passive attacks. Our analytical results show that anonymity can be made arbitrarily good at the cost of some added latency and required bandwidth. We also perform measurements on the Tor network to estimate the real-world performance of our protocol, showing that the added delay is not excessive. ...|$|R

We present a protocol that provides anonymity against an active adversary by using a black-box padding scheme that is effective against a passive adversary. Our protocol reduces, in some sense, providing anonymous communication against active attacks to providing a padding scheme against passive attacks. It uses timestamping to enforce timing patterns and redundancy to deal with both malicious and benign delays. Because of an asymmetry between sending data to a destination and receiving data from a destination, the protocol uses different techniques in each direction. Our analytical results show that anonymity can be made arbitrarily good at the cost of some added latency and required bandwidth.

40|$|An {{investigation}} of brake pad moisture {{effect on the}} passenger car's braking efficiency was carried out. The study aims to assess the change of the car‘s stopping distance at different pad irrigation parameters. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine the ultimate change of stopping distance, the length of stopping time and what variations of breaking parameters determine the efficiency of stopping. In this study it was determined what parameters condition the efficiency of breaking when the brake pads are damp. The change of breaking system efficiency was calculated from the moment of brake pedal operation to a full vehicle stop. For this investigation, a pad irritating system was installed in a chosen vehicle. The data of the test was recorded with DL 1 Mk 2 classical data recorder. MS Excel was used for calculations and graphical presentation of the results. According to the results of the study, the alteration of friction coefficient of <b>breaking</b> <b>pads</b> was assessed for both wet and dry braking pads. The change of breaking efficiency at different pad irrigation parameters was calculated. The course of investigation, analysis of calculation and the results of the study are presented in the paper...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Polishing {{process is}} a primary {{technique}} for planarization of material surface in manufacture fabrication. The pad structure and its material properties are important to determine the polish rate and planarity {{that can be achieved}} by the polishing process. Besides, the pad conditioning is used to regenerate the surface of the polishing <b>pad</b> surface by <b>breaking</b> up the glazed areas. Because the polishing and pad conditioning mechanism is inadequately understood and because higher levels of pad polishing performance are desired, the investigation of experiment becomes more important. In this paper, a high precision polishing machine has established. With an improved design, a test rig can be easily used to simulate the polishing, pad conditioning process and acquire the signals of temperature. The temperature of test pads (i. e. Rodel IC 1000 A, Rodel IC 1000 B and Opetech SB 660) is measured during polishing and pad conditioning process. For the self-design test rig, its surface temperature is measured by T-type thermocouples screwed behind the polishing (or conditioning) interface of the carrier. The parameters of thermal measurement, including polishing time, down force, rotation speed and particle size, increase the understanding of the mechanism on polishing pads during polishing / conditioning processes...|$|R
