25|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, Vought {{engineer}} Rex B.

In replacing the standard biplane observation aircraft with a more modern monoplane design, Beisel incorporated innovations becoming the first <b>production</b> <b>type</b> to be assembled with spot welding, a process Vought and the Naval Aircraft Factory jointly developed to create a smooth fuselage that resisted buckling and generated less drag. Beisel also introduced high-lift devices, spoilers and in a unique arrangement, deflector plate flaps and drooping ailerons located on {{the trailing edge of}} the wing were deployed to increase the camber of the wing and thus create additional lift.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY To {{evaluate}} whether abnormal <b>production</b> of <b>type</b> III collagen, the characteristic biochemical feature {{of patients with}} the type IV Ehiers-Danlos syndrome, consistently predisposes to mitral valve prolapse, we evaluated {{the family of a}} proband with classic type IV Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. <b>Production</b> of <b>type</b> III collagen was assessed with the use of cultured skin fibroblasts. Mitral valve prolapse was detected by M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiography. Biochemical abnormalities in the <b>production</b> of <b>type</b> III collagen and echocardiographic findings of mitral valve prolapse were completely concordant. All patients with abnormal <b>production</b> of <b>type</b> III collagen had mitral valve prolapse and all subjects with normal <b>production</b> of <b>type</b> III collagen had entirely normal echocardiograms. Six of the eight patients with abnormal <b>production</b> of <b>type</b> III collagen had subtle cutaneous abnormalities. The consistent association of abnormal <b>production</b> of <b>type</b> III collagen and mitral valve prolapse in this family suggests that this abnormality of collagen may give rise to mitral valve prolapse. MITRAL VALVE PROLAPSE (MVP) is a hetero-geneous clinical syndrome that affects 5 % or more of the population.

500|$|In {{order to}} meet the {{timetable}} set by the RCAF, Avro decided that Arrow program would adopt the Cook-Craigie plan. Normally a small number of prototypes of an aircraft were hand built and flown to find problems, and when solutions were found these changes would be worked into the design and then the production line would be set up. In a Cook-Craigie system, the production line was set up first and a small number of aircraft were built as production models. Any changes would be incorporated into the jigs while testing continued, with full production starting when the test program was complete. As Jim Floyd noted at the time, this was a risky approach, however: [...] "...it was decided to take the technical risks involved to save time on the programme... I will not pretend that this philosophy of <b>production</b> <b>type</b> build from the outset did not cause us a lot of problems in Engineering. However, it did achieve its objective." ...|$|E
500|$|The Type 26 {{revolver}} {{was issued}} with a clamshell holster {{similar to the}} French Modèle 1892 revolver. [...] The earliest Type 26 holsters were black, and the cotton lanyards issued with them were a dark blue color known in Japan as kon. A leather pocket for the cleaning rod was provided, sewn onto the forward edge of the holster body. Most examples of holsters are stamped {{on the inside of}} the clamshell flap with the maker's identification and arsenal inspection markings with the year of manufacture. [...] Very early holsters, issued in the late 1890s and early 1900s, were of a slightly different size and shape and without a pocket for the cleaning rod. A few holsters developed in 1943 have been noted to be all black lacquered hardware, missing the brass and galvanized steel fittings. Holsters produced towards the end of World War II have a last ditch fabric similar to late <b>production</b> <b>Type</b> 94 Nambu pistol holsters, with no shoulder straps or pouches for cleaning rods and ammunition.|$|E

The series had five variants, the Type A Model 1902 (also called the Grandpa Nambu), the Type A Model 1902 Modified (also known as the Papa Nambu), the Type B (also known as the Baby Nambu), the Type 14 (南部十四年式自動拳銃) and the Type 94. The pistols were designed by Kijiro Nambu and saw extensive service during the Russo-Japanese War, Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II. The Type A was made in very small numbers. Type A Modified and Type B Nambus were never formally adopted by any branch {{of the armed forces}} of Imperial Japan but were sold to officers through officer stores. The Type 14 was adopted as an official sidearm. As World War II progressed, and particularly in the final year of the war, in order to speed <b>production,</b> <b>Type</b> 14s began to be more hastily manufactured with a subsequent decline in quality.|$|E

They also have differing fluorescence characteristics, but no discernible visible absorption spectrum. Type IIa diamond can be colored pink, red, or brown due to structural anomalies [...] arising through plastic deformation during crystal growth—these diamonds are rare (1.8% of gem diamonds), but constitute {{a large percentage of}} Australian <b>production.</b> <b>Type</b> IIb diamonds, which account for 0.1% of gem diamonds, are usually light blue due to scattered boron within the crystal matrix; these diamonds are also semiconductors, unlike other diamond types (see Electrical properties of diamond). However, a blue-grey color may also occur in Type Ia diamonds and be unrelated to boron. Also not restricted to type are green diamonds, whose color is caused by GR1 color centers in the crystal lattice produced by exposure to varying quantities of radiation.|$|E
