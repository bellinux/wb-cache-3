Biogas technology has recently been considered {{as one of the}} few most promising renewable and sustainable energies. However, there exists certain challenges to household digester’s dissemination. Some of these challenges are very critical to the appreciation of anaerobic digestion processes as well as systems. The type of waste, feeding regime, temperature, <b>pressure,</b> <b>retention</b> <b>time,</b> hydrogen ion concentration and the carbon-tonitrogen ratio are considered to be very important factors for optimum anaerobic digestion processes. The plant sustainability and the quality of anaerobic digestion bi-products are also considered very important during design and implementation stages...|$|E

Chemical pretreatment and post treatment of coals relative to the chlorination were tried {{as a means of}} enhancing desulfurization by the chlorinolysis process. Elevated temperature (500 - 700 C) hydrogen treatment of chlorinolysis-processed coal at atmospheric pressure was found to substantially increase coal desulfurization up to 90 percent. Sulfur forms, proximate and ultimate analyses of the processed coal are included. Minipilot plant operation indicates that the continuous flow reactor provides coal desulfurization results comparable to those obtained in the batch reactor. Seven runs were conducted at coal feed rates of 1. 5 to 8. 8 kg per hour using water and methylchloroform solvents, gaseous chlorine feed of 3 to 31. 4 SCFH at 21 to 70 C, and atmospheric <b>pressure</b> for <b>retention</b> <b>times</b> of 20 to 120 minutes...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{the various}} {{parameters}} that influence air solubility and microbubble production in dissolved air flotation (DAF), a multitude of values that cover a large range for these parameters are suggested for field systems. An unpacked saturator and an air quantification unit were designed to specify the effects of power, <b>pressure,</b> temperature, hydraulic <b>retention</b> <b>time,</b> and air flow on the DAF performance. It was determined that a pressure of 621 kPa, hydraulic <b>retention</b> <b>time</b> of 18. 2 min, and air flow of 8. 5 L/h {{would be the best}} controlled parameters for maximum efficiency in this unit. A temperature of 7 °C showed the greatest microbubble production, but temperature control would not be expected in actual application. The maximum microbubble flow from the designed system produced 30 mL of air (± 1. 5) per L of water under these conditions with immediate startup. The maximum theoretical dissolved air volume of 107 mL (± 6) was achieved at a <b>retention</b> <b>time</b> of 2 h and a pressure of 621 kPa. To isolate and have better control over the various DAF operational parameters, the DAF unit was operated without the unsaturated flow stream. This mode of operation {{led to the formation of}} large bubbles at peak bubble production rates. In a real-world application, the large bubble formation will be avoided by mixing with raw unsaturated stream and by altering the location of dissolved air output flow...|$|R

He {{wrote about the}} potential of using CGA in drilling fluids to reduce near wellbore formation damage (Brookey 1998). CGA has also been studied to enhance blocking capacity. Growcock et al. (2006) investigated the flow of CGA in porous media by microcosmic visualization model; they summarized that when CGA drilling fluid entered the formation, the CGA moved forward rapidly to concentrate at the fluid front and established a microenvironment that segregated the bulk fluid from the formation. There was successful blockage of the micromodel and porous media by the stable CGA fluid {{as compared to the}} flow of fluids formulated with only polymer and only surfactant; pressure drop through porous media increased continuously as more CGA fluid was injected into the porous media (Bjorndalen et al. 2014). The CGA fluids showed more stable frontal displacement, lower injection <b>pressure</b> and longer <b>retention</b> <b>time</b> as compared to polymer flooding (Samuel et al. 2012). These characteristics of the flow behavior of CGA in porous media were the main motivation behind the idea of using CGA for applications in enhanced oil recovery.

Both nations are expanding their palm oil production capacity {{and the market}} continues to grow. With the current acreage of 4. 49 million hectares of Palm Oil Cultivation in Malaysia, it is estimate 26. 2 million tonnes of oil palm frond are treated as biomass. Oil palm frond consist huge amount of fiber, in which it can be transform into cellulose. Fronds are taken from oil palm tree as wastes, which are normally burnt. This research is to prepare and produce the cellulose fiber from oil palm frond. Steam explosion pre-treatment was conducted to enhance the accessibility of the oil palm frond lignocellulose. The combination of temperature and time known as the Log Ro in steam explosion process were used as the main parameter in this research. It has many applications in pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, foods, paper and structural composites. For pharmaceutical uses, it {{is used as a}} binding agent and also as a disintegrating agent. MCC also naturally derived stabilizer, texturing agent and a fat substitute. The MCC was prepared by controlled acid hydrolysis of the isolated α-cellulose which attacked the amorphous region and was followed by the back neutralization process alkalization. The structural properties of cellulose and microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) were studied by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). Basically the process for producing microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) involves preparation of holocellulose and α-cellulose from oil palm frond.

40|$|The {{hydraulic}} <b>retention</b> <b>time</b> {{has been}} identified as the key operating parameter that affects the performance of the UASB reactor. For low-strength wastewaters such as the domestic wastewater, it is the limiting design parameter.

The highly fluctuating flow rates of domestic wasterwater, which corresponds to fluctuating hydrualic <b>retention</b> <b>times,</b> have been cited as one of the inherent difficulties for application of the UASB reactor in domestic wastewater treatment.

40|$|DRAM cells {{store data}} {{in the form of}} charge on a capacitor. This charge leaks off over time, {{eventually}} causing data to be lost. To prevent this data loss from occurring, DRAM cells must be periodically refreshed. Unfortunately, DRAM refresh operations waste energy and also degrade system performance by interfering with memory requests. These problems are expected to worsen as DRAM density increases. The amount of time that a DRAM cell can safely retain data without being refreshed is called the cell’s <b>retention</b> <b>time.</b> In current systems, all DRAM cells are refreshed at the rate required to guarantee the integrity of the cell with the shortest <b>retention</b> <b>time,</b> resulting in unnecessary refreshes for cells with longer <b>retention</b> <b>times.</b> Prior work has proposed to reduce unnecessary refreshes by exploiting differences in <b>retention</b> <b>time</b> among DRAM cells; however, such mechanisms require knowledge of each cell’s <b>retention</b> <b>time.</b> In this paper, we present a comprehensive quantitative study of retention behavior in modern DRAMs. Using a temperaturecontrolled FPGA-based testing platform, we collect <b>retention</b> <b>time</b> information from 248 commodity DDR 3 DRAM chips from five major DRAM vendors.

Further, the calculation of <b>retention</b> <b>times</b> and peak widths for optimization purposes is discussed...|$|R
