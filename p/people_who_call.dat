25|$|Peronism is a {{political}} phenomenon that draws support from both the political left and political right. Peronism is not considered a traditional party, but {{a political}} movement, because of {{the wide variety of}} <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>call</b> themselves Peronists, and there is great controversy surrounding his personality. The following Argentinian presidents were Peronist: Hector Campora, Isabel Perón, Carlos Menem, Eduardo Duhalde, Nestor Kirchner and Cristina Kirchner.|$|E
25|$|Other tribes {{claiming}} partial {{descent from}} surviving Roanoke colonists include the Catawba (who absorbed the Shakori and Eno people), and the Coree and the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>call</b> themselves the Lumbee. Samuel A'Court Ashe {{was convinced that}} the colonists had relocated westward to the banks of the Chowan River in Bertie County, and Conway Whittle Sams claimed that after being attacked by Wanchese and Powhatan, the colonists scattered to multiple locations: the Chowan River, and south to the Pamlico and Neuse Rivers.|$|E
25|$|The Mayos are {{the most}} {{numerous}} indigenous ethnic group in the state with more than 75,000 who have maintained their language and traditions. These <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> <b>call</b> themselves Yoreme, are descended from ancient Huatabampo culture. They are concentrated along the Mayo River. Most {{are found in the}} municipalities of Álamos, Quiriego and others in the south of the state, as well as {{in some parts of the}} coast near the Isla Tiburón. There is also a notable community in the northwest of Sonora. Their religion is a mix of Catholicism and traditional beliefs, which they assimilated along with European farming and livestock knowledge. Mayo houses often have a cross made of ironwood to protect against evil. Ethnically pure Mayos tend to segregate themselves from mestizos and other ethnicities. The Mayos make their living from subsistence farming, working on larger farms and combing wild area for herbs, fruits and other resources. They also work making crafts in wood making utensils and decorative items.|$|E

500|$|Edward Easton, Vilma Hollingbery, Kath Hughes, James Meehan and Vicky Hall {{provide the}} voices of various <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>call</b> in to the centre. Some of the voice actors were drawn from the comedy group Gein's Family Giftshop, the {{performing}} members of which are Hughes, Easton and Meehan. After watching a Gein's Family Giftshop performance, Pemberton and Shearsmith had invited the members to star in Inside No. 9. The comedians then suggested that they also appear on-screen as extras, playing unnamed call centre volunteers. Hollingberry, who voiced [...] "Ivy", an old woman caller, had previously starred in Pemberton and Shearsmith's Psychoville as Mrs Wren/Mrs Ladybirdface. She {{was one of the}} few actors whom Pemberton and Shearsmith used in both series.|$|E
500|$|In a 2004 plot, Dot was {{diagnosed}} with kidney cancer. The programme makers sought advice from health care professionals when devising the storyline, including specialist information nurses from CancerBACUP. Nurse Martin Ledwick said, [...] "We drew on our experience of talking {{to the thousands of}} <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>call</b> our helpline, to help advise the EastEnders scriptwriters. Many people react to a cancer diagnosis as Dot does in the BBC serial– with confusion and fear. We also speak to family and friends affected by the illness and those living with continuing uncertainty. EastEnders explores all these issues, and hopefully will help improve people's understanding of what it's like to be affected by a cancer diagnosis." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a feature}} for 1UP.com, Jeremy Parish states that many Metroid fans were {{disappointed}} by the game's story, power-up restrictions and its [...] "awkward handling of its leading lady". Video game scholar Luke Arnott argued that players were dissatisfied with Other M {{because it did not}} consistently balance gameplay constraints with player agency, and because it failed at what he calls “imperative” storytelling. Arnott suggested that studying how games like Other M create meaning in virtual spaces may help design better games and situate them within wider theories of postmodern subjectivity. Clyde Mandelin of Legends of Localization noted that the game received mixed-to-positive reactions from Japanese fans. Kotakus Luke Plunkett wrote that Team Ninja was blamed by [...] "many people" [...] for the game's story; Hayashi later clarified that Sakamoto wrote the story himself. Nintendo Treehouse producer Nate Bihldorff stated that the scene depicting Samus' encounter with Ridley [...] "is not a sign of weakness, but of strength. <b>People</b> <b>who</b> <b>call</b> out that scene as anything but empowering are kind of missing the point". He added that Samus' story [...] "has largely been a matter of individual perception, especially in the US, where people haven't read any of the official manga related to her childhood." ...|$|E

This {{is one of the}} few instances where the U.S.government permitted a tribe to return to their traditional boundaries. The Navajo were granted 3.5million acres (14,000km²) of land inside their four sacred mountains. The Navajo also became a more cohesive tribe after the Long Walk and were able to successfully increase the size of their reservation since then, to over 16 million acres (70,000km²).|$|E

She sends policemen on sick-leave when they refuse to bow in front of her. She takes revenge from <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>call</b> her ‘Soumitra’ instead of addressing her as the ‘Madamji’. She mocks tears during a political speech as she talks about her late husband and in the next scene curses the insurance company for not giving her the due money.

[...] Lee Ferguson, a consultant to KWST, {{said in an interview that}} Los Angeles radio stations were banning disc jockeys from using the term and noted, [...] "Most of the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>call</b> music new wave are the ones looking for a way not to play it."

2500|$|Curry's death saw {{an angry}} {{reaction}} {{from both the}} UDA's C Company on the Shankill and the LVF, with a death threat issued against McDonald and Cusack by LVF associate Jackie Mahood and his dissident UDA allies due to their reporting of Curry's involvement in bomb-making, an issue that his loyalist supporters felt was the crucial factor {{in the decision to}} kill Curry. For its part, the Red Hand Defenders issued a statement which blamed the killing on the UVF and threatened retaliation, although Gusty Spence, by then a leading figure in the Progressive Unionist Party (PUP), quickly denied the claims that it was a UVF attack, a sentiment echoed by PUP leader David Ervine. The killing was also condemned by Ulster Democratic Party activist John White who said [...] "it's disgraceful that a man who dedicated his life to the loyalist cause should be cut down like this by <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>call</b> themselves loyalists". Curry was close to White and had hoped to see him on the day of his killing in order that White might help him with some job applications.|$|E

5000|$|The taxonomic {{status of}} the Mariana mallard is disputed, since it resembles an {{intermediate}} of the mallard and the Pacific black duck, two closely related allopatric species which frequently hybridise. Its males had two intergrading color morphs, called the [...] "platyrhynchos" [...] and the [...] "superciliosa" [...] types after the species they resembled more. It was first scientifically described by Tommaso Salvadori as full species in the genus Anas, named after its collector, the French zoologist Emile Oustalet.

60|$|Again. Among poor women, as well {{as among}} rich ones, as they grow older, how much gossiping, tale-bearing, slandering, there is, and that too among <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>call</b> {{themselves}} religious. Yes, I say slandering; I put that in too; for I am certain that where the first two grow, the third is not far off. If gossiping is the root, tale- bearing and harsh judgment is the stem, and plain lying and slandering, and bearing false witness against one's neighbour, is the fruit.|$|E
