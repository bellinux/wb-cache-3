40|$|Lube pump gears of an Aircraft Mounted Accessory Gearbox (AMAGB) {{were found}} to have cracks on the face and gear root areas after {{completion}} of 290 h of flight trials and 1000 h of endurance test respectively. After a preliminary investigation, the subject gears were forwarded to this laboratory for analyzing the cause(s) of failure. The gears were provided in cut-pieces. Dye penetrant inspection (DPI) carried out showed presence of cracks in gears AGB 02 1008 and AGB 02 1009. The DPI signatures were very feeble indicating that the cracks were very tight. Subsequent examination of the gears in scanning electron microscope revealed presence of one crack in gear AGB 02 1008 and six cracks in gear AGB 02 1009. However, no cracks could be identified on the available portion of gear AGB 02 1013. A few representative cracks observed in gear AGB 02 1009 were pulled open for further study. All these cracks {{were found to}} be very shallow and they were found to be confined only to the carburized layer. Macroscopic examination of the crack surface gave no evidence of corrosion, fatigue marks or rapid ductile failure. Based on these, the crack generation either by fatigue mechanism or stress corrosion cracking (SCC) was ruled out. Electron fractographic study, however, showed typical brittle, intergranular mode of crack propagation, suggestive of hydrogen embrittlement (HE) failure. Investigation revealed that the gears were given <b>phosphating</b> <b>treatment.</b> In view of the hydrogen embrittlement as the cause of crack generation, the question arises whether or not the <b>phosphating</b> <b>treatment</b> had been performed as per standard practice. It is reported that the <b>phosphating</b> <b>treatment</b> involved electrolytic processes. Therefore, the possibility of hydrogen embrittlement is inherent in this case. In the event of not performing baking operation after <b>phosphating</b> <b>treatment,</b> failure by hydrogen embrittlement is inevitable. Metallurgical examination showed that neither the chemical composition of the steel nor the hardness profile of the gears conformed to the specification. The gear material was found to contain high amount of MnS inclusions. The effective case depth and the core hardness were found to be more than the specifications in all gears. In addition, the surface of the gears was found to have asperities resulting during the <b>phosphating</b> <b>treatment.</b> In summary, the gears in question have failed by HE. The steel picked up hydrogen during <b>phosphating</b> <b>treatment.</b> The susceptibility to HE was further increased due to high hardness in the material, stress concentrations in the hard carburized layer, and more importantly, presence of MnS in the microstructure. ...|$|R

40|$|Heavy metal {{contamination}} of soil is an environmental {{and public health}} issue of prime interest because metals are non-biodegradable and accumulate throughout the food chain. Conventional heavy metal remediation technologies include chemical precipitation, membrane filtration, ion exchange, electrochemical treatment, etc. Recently adsorption has become an alternative treatment method of contaminated media and a great effort {{has been devoted to}} develop new adsorbents. <b>Phosphate</b> <b>treatment</b> is widely considered an effective in situ treatment to reduce metal mobility and bioavailability in soils through the formation of highly insoluble phosphates which are stable {{in a wide range of}} environmental conditions. The mechanisms of metal retention are still debated and include: ion exchange, dissolution/precipitation and surface complexation. Various types of phosphate amendments, such as synthetic and natural apatites, phosphate rocks, bone meal and bone char have been tested. <b>Phosphate</b> <b>treatment</b> has been shown to be effective in stabilizing Pb, Cd, Cu, Zn, Co, Ni, Sb, Cr, V in contaminated soils. In soils phosphate stabilization has been applied mainly to remediate Pb contamination although the method can be used to reduce also the mobility and bioavailability of other metals. The main factors determining the removal capacity of <b>phosphate</b> <b>treatment</b> in contaminated soils include type of phosphate source due to their different solubilities, rate of phosphate application, heavy metals speciation, soil pH and Eh and grain size of the amendment. The adverse effects of phosphate stabilization resulting in enhanced leaching of phosphate and availability in the soil of contaminants, such as As, Se and W, have to be addressed for evaluating the environmental impact of <b>phosphate</b> <b>treatment.</b> © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

40|$|The {{stabilisation}} of Pb in {{the soil}} by phosphate is influenced by environmental conditions and physicochemical properties of the soils {{to which it is}} applied. Stabilisation of Pb by phosphate was examined in four soils under different environmental conditions. The effect of soil moisture and temperature on stabilisation of Pb by phosphate was examined by measurement of water extractable and bioaccessible Pb, sequential fractionation and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The addition of humic acid, ammonium nitrate and chloride was also examined for inhibition or improvement of Pb stability with <b>phosphate</b> <b>treatment.</b> The effect of moisture level varied between soils. In soil MB and DA a soil moisture level of 50 % water holding capacity was sufficient to maximise stabilisation of Pb, but in soil TV and PE reduction in bioaccessible Pb was inhibited at this moisture level. Providing moisture at twice the soil water holding capacity did not enhance the effect of phosphate on Pb stabilisation. The difference of Pb stability as a result of incubating phosphate treated soils at 18 °C and 37 °C was relatively small. However wet-dry cycles decreased the effectiveness of <b>phosphate</b> <b>treatment.</b> The reduction in bioaccessible Pb obtained was between 20 and 40 % with the most optimal treatment conditions.

40|$|ABSTRACT Day-old Cobb x Cobb broiler chicks were {{housed in}} battery brooders for 21 -day feeding periods during two experiments. Dietary {{treatments}} {{consisted of a}} corn-soybean starter feed (. 37 % total;. 14 % nonphytin phosphorus) supplemented with 0,. 05,. 10,. 15, or. 28 % phosphorus {{in the form of}} dicalcium phosphate, precipitated bone phosphate, or a mixture of soft and precipitated phosphates (each providing 50 % of the phosphorus addition). Total dietary calcium was held constant at. 90 %. Comparable dietary phosphorus from precipitated bone and the soft-precipitated mixture supported body weights statistically equivalent to those of dicalcium <b>phosphate</b> <b>treatments.</b> Tibia ash results at suboptimal phosphorus levels, with one exception, indicated statistically equal utilization from the soft-precipitated combination. Slope-ratio techniques using tibia ash and total nonphytin phosphorus intake established the bioavailability of phosphorus from precipitated bone was 120 % when dicalcium phosphate was the standard. The data indicate that precipitated bone phosphate for broilers was fully equivalent in performance to dicalcium phosphate. Providing one-half the supplemental phosphorus from both soft phosphate and precipi-tated bone seemed to be an acceptable method of meeting practical phosphorus requirements...|$|R
