50|$|The ancient port of Cosa {{is located}} below {{the city on}} the hill to the southeast. It was likely founded {{at the same time as}} the early Roman colony in 273 BC, and thus {{represents}} the earliest Roman harbor known thus far. The port was initially associated with the Etruscans, however excavations have determined that it was first used by the Romans in the 3rd century BC and continued being used into the 3rd century AD, as confirmed by the material evidence. The Cosa harbor was never a major <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>transit,</b> however in ancient times it provided the best anchorage between Gaeta in the south and La Spezia to the north. This was probably a primary reason for the colony’s position within newly acquired Etruscan territory. Eventually the harbor established its own community, including a temple dedicated either to Portunus or Neptune, which resembled the Temple on the Arx and probably also dates to 170-160. In addition, remains of fish tanks have been found which suggest the importance of aquiculture and the production of garum. The port’s main period of prosperity occurred from the late 2nd century BC through the later 1st century BC, and there was a revival by the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD due to the growth of the villa economy in the countryside of Cosa. Although the city of Cosa and the port must have interacted in important ways, material evidence indicates that they do not follow a parallel development.|$|E

40|$|The years {{coinciding with}} the {{publication}} of Vincenz Bronzin’s main work, witch appeared in 1908, represent for Trieste a time of fast-paced and intense economic and social development, that put this Adriatic town, before the first World War, on the international map as great industrial, port and financial centre. More and more integrated in the economy of the Habsburg Empire, Trieste’s financial landscape is still dominated by the merchant families that were the historical protagonists of the growding trading wealth between the 18 th and 19 th century. They have control of the Stock Exchange, the evolution of the powerfull institution created in 1755 to regulate market exchanges and wich has followed the decline of this trading centre, now turned into a <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>transit.</b> In spite of the limited number of listed companies and monetary exchanges, the Stock Exchanges Commitee, trought its regulations, puts in place a strong self-management and self-regulating system, it issues strict surveillance provisions, and performs a screening function to shape the trading system, overseeing ang defending it from the assaults of unrestreined speculation. The decline of the Stock Exchange is accompanied by the rise of insurance companies. Established {{in the first half of}} the 19 th century, in the early 20 th century Assicurazioni Generali e Riunione Adriatica di Sicurtà were the main insurance conpanies of the Habsburg Empire, ready to conquer also the markets of Europe and Far Earst. They were still in the hands of Trieste’s great historical merchant families, who made up the most relevant and influential group of stakeholders. These were business enterprises aimed to collect private savings, with the need to set aside significant reserves to face unexpected risks, wich leads the management to opt for investments that offer lower returns but greater security, mainly consisting in government stock and also in real estate. Thus speculation and security coexist in a unique balance in Trieste’s financial world...|$|E

40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{whether the}} Jews leaving Tsarist Russia and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, {{part of the}} transatlantic mass migration {{of the end of}} the nineteenth century, became subject to state control. Most emigrants from Eastern Europe in this period passed through the <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> Bremen, Hamburg and Antwerp. In the 1880 s only a few emigrants were not welcome in America and sent back to Europe, but economic competition and the supposed health threat immigrants posed meant the US became the trendsetter in implementing protectionist immigration policy in the 1890 s. More emigrants were returned to Europe because of the newly erected US federal immigration control stations, but many more were denied the possibility to leave for the United States by the remote control mechanism which the American authorities enforced on the European authorities and the shipping companies. At the Russian-German border and the <b>port</b> <b>of</b> Antwerp, shipping companies stopped transit migrants who were deemed medically unacceptable by American standards. The shipping companies became subcontractors for the American authorities as they risked heavy fines if they transported unwanted emigrants. The Belgian authorities refused to collaborate with the Americans and defended their sovereignty, and made shipping companies in the <b>port</b> <b>of</b> Antwerp solely responsible for the American remote migration control. Due to the private migration control at the <b>port</b> <b>of</b> Antwerp <b>transit</b> migrants became stuck in Belgium. The Belgian authorities wanted these stranded migrants to return “home. ” It seems that the number of stranded migrants remained manageable as the Belgian authorities did not make the shipping companies pay the bill. They were able to get away by making some symbolic gestures and these migrants were supported by charitable contributions from the local Jewish community...|$|R
2500|$|The {{areas from}} the capital east to the <b>port</b> <b>of</b> Veracruz saw {{significant}} regional development along this main transportation route. Alexander von Humboldt called this area [...] "Mesa de Anahuac" [...] which {{can be defined as}} the adjacent valleys of Puebla, Mexico, and Toluca, enclosed by high mountains, along with their connections to the <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> Gulf Coast <b>port</b> <b>of</b> Veracruz and the Pacific <b>port</b> <b>of</b> Acapulco, where over half the population of New Spain lived. These valleys were linked trunk lines, that is main routes, facilitating the movement of vital goods and people to get to key areas. But the difficulty <b>of</b> <b>transit</b> <b>of</b> people and goods, even in this relatively richly endowed region of Mexico in the absence of rivers and level terrain should not be discounted as a major challenge to the economy of New Spain. This challenge <b>of</b> <b>transit</b> persisted during the post-independence years until the late nineteenth-century construction of railroads. In the colonial era and up until railroads were built in key areas, mule trains were the main mode of transporting goods. Mules were used since unpaved roads and mountainous terrain could not generally accommodate carts.|$|R

This was first officially formulated in spatial planning documents in 1974, and construction started in 1977. The first, 8.3 km section was completed in July 1988, between Diračje and Orehovica interchange, executed as a two-lane expressway with grade separated intersections. The 4.0 km Diračje - Matulji and Matulji - Jušići sections, completed in 1990 and 1991 respectively, were built as four-lane expressways without emergency lanes. Those completed the western arm of Rijeka bypass, but traffic proceeding east from Orehovica interchange to Krk Island, Crikvenica, and Senj still had to switch to streets of Rijeka.|$|R
