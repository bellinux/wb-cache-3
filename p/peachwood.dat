50|$|While many deities {{are part}} of the tradition, some of the most {{recognized}} holy figures include Guan Yin, the Jade Emperor and Buddha. Many of the stories have since evolved into traditional Chinese holidays. Other concepts have extended to outside of mythology into spiritual symbols such as Door god and the Imperial guardian lions. Along with the belief of the holy, there is also the evil. Practices such as Taoist exorcism fighting mogwai and jiangshi with <b>peachwood</b> swords {{are just some of the}} concepts passed down from generations. A few Chinese fortune telling rituals are still in use today after thousands of years of refinement.|$|E
50|$|The {{gates and}} doors of Chinese houses have long {{received}} special ritual attention. Sacrifices {{to a door}} spirit are recorded {{as early as the}} Book of Rites. By the Han, this spirit had become the two gods Shentu and Yulü, whose names or images were painted into <b>peachwood</b> and attached to doors. The Great Ancestor of the Tang ("Emperor Taizong") ordered portraits of his generals Qin Shubao and Yuchi Gong to be affixed to gates. They eventually came to be considered divine protectors, replacing Shentu and Yulü and remaining the most common door gods to the present day. Qin and Yuchi, along with various other deified military leaders, make up a class of martial door gods intended to ward off evil spirits and bad influences. A separate group of scholars make up a class of civil door gods intended to attract blessings and good fortune. Some deities are also thought to have guardians who serve a similar role at their temples, such as Mazu's companions Qianliyan and Shunfeng'er.|$|E
5000|$|The (5th century) Book of the Later Han also {{describes}} fangxiangshi in the Nuo exorcism.One {{day before}} the sacrifice {{of the end of}} the year the great no is celebrated, called expulsion of epidemical disease. The ritual of it is the following — From among the apprentices of the inner Yellow Gate of the Palace, one hundred and twenty of ten, eleven or twelve years are selected to act as 'lads'; they are dressed with red bonnets and black coats, and they carry large hand-drums. The fang-siang shi with four eyes of gold and masked with bearskins, wearing black coats and red skirts, grasp their lances and wield their shields. There are also twelve animals with feathers or hairs, and with horns. These people start their work at the inner Yellow Gate, under command of a Chamberlain in general employ, to expel maleficent spectres from the Forbidden Palace. before dawn, the 120 boys and all the court officials gather together and repeat a chant listing 12 demon-eating spirits, [...] "Jiazuo These twelve divinities are herewith ordered to chase away evil and misfortune, to scorch your bodies, seize your bones and joints, cut your flesh in pieces, tear out your lungs and bowels. If you do not get quickly away, the stragglers among you will become their food. Now the fang-siang are set to work. Together with those twelve animals (representing these twelve demon-devourers) they lump about screaming, making three tours round about the inner Palace buildings in front and behind, and with their torches they escort the pestilential disease out of the front gate. Outside this gate, swift horsemen take over the torches and leave the Palace through the Marshal’s Gate, on the outside of which they transfer them to horsemen of the fifth army-corps, who thereupon drive the spectres into the Loh river. In every mansion of the official world, men with wooden masks and representing animals may act as leaders of the performers of the no. When the ceremony is finished, keng of <b>peachwood</b> are put up, with Yuh-lei and ropes of reed, after which the performers and the officers in attendance on the throne stop their work. Ropes of reed, lances, and sticks of peach wood are presented by the emperor to the highest ministers, commanders, and special and general feudal rulers. (tr. Groot 1910 6: 976-977) The syntax of this fangxiangshi description differs from the Zhouli: 方相氏黃金四目蒙熊皮 [...] "the fangxiangshi wears four golden eyes and is covered by a bearskin".|$|E
