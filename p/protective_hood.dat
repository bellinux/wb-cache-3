The front sight is contained in a <b>protective</b> <b>hood</b> {{with a hole in}} the top to insert an elevation adjustment tool, while the rear sight is shielded by two metal ears.|$|E
25|$|The L-shaped rear sight has two {{apertures}} preset for {{firing at}} 0–300m and 300–500m respectively (the rear sight {{can only be}} adjusted for elevation). The front post is fully adjustable for both windage and elevation zero and is enclosed in a <b>protective</b> <b>hood.</b> Low-light flip-up front blade and rear sight elements have three self-luminous tritium capsules (betalights) which are calibrated for 100 m when deployed. When the rear night sight is flipped up for use, the rear aperture sights must be placed in an offset position intermediate between the two apertures. Certain variants have a receiver-mounted dovetail adapter {{that is used to}} mount various optical sights.|$|E

40|$|The hood is {{recognized}} throughout {{the nuclear industry}} as the standard radiological protective head covering for use in radioactively contaminated work environments. As of June 15, 1995, hoods were required for all activities performed in contaminated areas at the Y- 12 Plant. The use of hoods had historically been limited to those radiological activities with a high potential for personnel contamination. Due to the large size of many posted contaminated areas at the Y- 12 Plant, and compounding safety factors, requirements {{for the use of}} hoods are being reevaluated. The purpose of the evaluation is to develop technically sound guidelines for the selection of hoods when prescribing radiological protective head covering.

40|$|Feral pigeons (Columba livia domestica), which {{thrive in}} most European towns and cities, are {{commonly}} {{infected with the}} zoonotic bacterium Chlamydophila psittaci, the agent of psittacosis (also known as ornithosis) in humans. A number of surveys carried out over {{the last thirty years}} across Europe have detected high seropositivity values and high percentages of infection in feral pigeon populations. Overall, when considering data from 11 European countries, seropositivity values to C. psittaci in the sampled populations ranged from 19. 4 % to 95. 6 %. In most surveys, the complement fixation test was used, and antibodies were detected in 19. 4 - 66. 3 % of the samples, with a median of 46. 1 %. Indirect immunofluorescence and ELISA tests were employed less frequently, but led to the detection of higher percentages of seropositivity (23. 7 - 67. 7 % and 35. 9 - 95. 6 %, respectively). Attempts to grow C. psittaci in cell culture or embryonated chicken eggs were successful in 2 - 42. 3 % and 0 - 57. 1 % of samples, respectively, antigen detection methods were positive in 2. 3 - 40 % of samples, while conventional PCR and real-time PCR using different genomic targets detected the organism in 3. 4 - 50 % of samples. Twenty-five C. psittaci isolates from pigeons were typed as ompA genotype B (n= 14), E (n= 10) and E/B (n= 1). The huge increase of feral pigeon populations in Europe is a major cause of concern for the detrimental effect of pigeon droppings on environmental hygiene, in addition to the extensive damage due to the fouling of buildings and monuments. The most important pathogenic organism transmissible from feral pigeons to humans is C. psittaci, with 101 cases of disease reported in the literature. Exposure to C. psittaci-contaminated dust, direct contact with pigeons through handling and, to a lesser extent, through pigeon feeding have been identified as hazardous exposures in {{more than half of the}} human cases, while loose or transient contacts with feral pigeons have been mentioned in abou 40 % of the cases. Education initiatives as to the communication of a health risk resulting from contact with pigeons and pigeon excreta should primarily be targeted at individuals who may be exposed to C. psittaci-contaminated dust, such as demolition/construction workers. Recommendations to this category of workers include wearing <b>protective</b> clothes with <b>hoods,</b> boots, gloves and air filter face masks when removing pigeon faeces from roofs, garrets and buildings, especially if working indoors. Monitoring for C. psittaci infections in these workers over time should also be considered. Children should be warned not to handle sick or dead pigeons, and immunocompromised individuals should be advised to carefully limit their contact to feral pigeons. Culling of pigeons by shooting or poisoning is both unethical and ineffective as the place of the killed birds in the population is quickly filled by new juveniles or immigrating birds from neighbouring areas. Pigeon-deterring systems, such as nets and plastic or metal spikes applied to buildings and monuments will prevent their fouling, and the administration of contraceptive drugs may allow size regulation of the pigeon populations. Nevertheless, the measure that will ultimately lead to permanent reduction and will establish healthy sustainable populations is the restriction of indiscriminate feeding by pigeon lovers. The erection of dovecotes and artificial breeding facilities should be considered for providing shelter and a balanced diet to the birds, as well as a chance of interaction for pigeon lovers in a hygienically controlled environment...|$|R

50|$|The third EVA began 6 December 1993 at 10:34 pm EST while Endeavour {{was over}} Australia. Hoffman {{installed}} guide studs on the Wide Field Planetary Camera (WF/PC) and prepared the WF/PC for removal while Musgrave {{set up a}} work platform and worked on opening an access door to allow observation of WF/PC status lights. Hoffman attached the support handle to the WF/PC and, with assistance by Claude Nicollier on the arm and a free floating Story Musgrave, removed the WF/PC during the night pass starting at 11:41 pm EST. The WF/PC was clear of the telescope by 11:48 pm EST and moved back into its storage container. A <b>protective</b> <b>hood</b> was then removed on the new WFPC2 camera (protecting its fragile external mirror) and the 620 lb WFPC2 was then installed at 1:05 am EST. Ground controllers then ran an Aliveness Test and 35 minutes later reported that the new camera successfully performed its series of initial tests. The new Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 had a higher rating than the previous model, especially in the ultraviolet range, and included its own spherical aberration correction system.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{ability to}} analyze cryopreserved {{peripheral}} blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) from biobanks for antigen-specific immunity {{is necessary to}} evaluate response to immune-based therapies. To ensure comparable assay results, collaborative research in multicenter trials needs reliable and reproducible cryopreservation that maintains cell viability and functionality. A standardized cryopreservation procedure is comprised of not only sample collection, preparation and freezing but also low temperature storage in liquid nitrogen without any temperature fluctuations, to avoid cell damage. Therefore, we have developed a storage approach to minimize suboptimal storage conditions {{in order to maximize}} cell viability, recovery and T-cell functionality. We compared the influence of repeated temperature fluctuations on cell health from sample storage, sample sorting and removal in comparison to sample storage without temperature rises. We found that cyclical temperature shifts during low temperature storage reduce cell viability, recovery and immune response against specific-antigens. We showed that samples handled under a <b>protective</b> <b>hood</b> system, to avoid or minimize such repeated temperature rises, have comparable cell viability and cell recovery rates to samples stored without any temperature fluctuations. Also T-cell functionality could be considerably increased {{with the use of the}} <b>protective</b> <b>hood</b> system compared to sample handling without such a protection system. This data suggests that the impact of temperature fluctuation on cell integrity should be carefully considered in future clinical vaccine trials and consideration should be given to optimal sample storage conditions...|$|E

On abdominal examination she had pain in the upper quadrants,without peritoneal irritation. The successful endoscopic removal decreases if delayed approach, beyond 12 h, and sharp objects. Moreover in case of sharp objects, even if already into the stomach or duodenum, they should be retrieved endoscopically {{if it can be}} accomplished safely, because the risk of a complication during its natural exteriorization is as high as 35 %. Extreme caution is required as it is easy to injure the wall of the gastrointestinal tract, in order to that one method involves using an overtube to protect the esophagus and another technique fashioning a <b>protective</b> <b>hood.</b> Instead we were able to remove all the needles without complication using the method described above.

40|$|The {{proper use}} of {{protective}} hoods on panel saws should reliably prevent severe injuries from (hand) contact with the blade or material kickbacks. It also should minimize long-term lung damages from fine-particle pollution. To achieve both purposes the hood must be adjusted properly by the operator for each workpiece to fit its height. After a work process is finished, the hood must be lowered down completely to the bench. Unfortunately, in practice the <b>protective</b> <b>hood</b> is fixed at a high position {{for most of the}} work time and herein loses its safety features. A system for an automatic height adjustment of the hood would increase comfort and safety. If the system can distinguish between workpieces and skin reliably, it furthermore will reduce occupational hazards for panel saw users. A functional demonstrator of such a system has been designed and implemented to show the feasibility of this approach. A specific optical sensor system is used to observe a point on the extended cut axis in front of the blade. The sensor determines the surface material reliably and measures the distance to the workpiece surface simultaneously. If the distance changes because of a workpiece fed to the machine, the control unit will set the motor-adjusted hood to the correct height. If the sensor detects skin, the hood will not be moved. In addition a camera observes the area under the hood. If there are no workpieces or offcuts left under the hood, it will be lowered back to the default position...|$|E
