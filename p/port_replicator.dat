25|$|A {{breakout}} dock is conceptually {{a breakout}} {{box in the}} form of a dock. It is an extension to a typical <b>port</b> <b>replicator</b> in that it not only replicates existing ports already on the computer, but also offers additional ports. Modern computers most often accomplish this by using a special, often proprietary, connector that consolidates the signals from many concealed traces from onboard external buses into one connector. As such, the dock can offer a greater number of ports than is physically present on the computer. This allows the basic unit to have fewer physical ports while still allowing users a way to access to the full range of features of its motherboard.|$|E
2500|$|In {{computing}} {{and video}} gaming, a docking station or <b>port</b> <b>replicator</b> or dock provides a simplified way of [...] "plugging-in" [...] an electronic device {{such as the}} [...] tablet-like hybrid video game console, the Nintendo Switch and laptop computer to common peripherals. Because {{a wide range of}} dockable devices—from mobile telephones to wireless mice—have different connectors, power signaling, and uses, docks are not standardized and are therefore often designed with a specific make and model of a device in mind.|$|E

50|$|The first {{generation}} (xx10) of Precision laptops {{is compatible with}} the E-Series Advanced <b>Port</b> <b>Replicators</b> except the 5510. The second generation (xx20) the 3520 & 5520 do not support the E-Series docking station but the 7520 & 7720 do.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Port</b> <b>replicators</b> (also called passthroughs) are {{functionally}} and logically {{identical to}} {{a bundle of}} extension cables, except that they are plugged in and unplugged together through the docking port. Some also include electrical adaptors to change from one pinout to another (e.g., Micro-DVI to normal DVI connector.) ...|$|R
40|$|We study light {{propagation}} through cyclic arrays, composed by {{copies of a}} given PT-symmetric dimer, using a group theoretical approach and finite element modeling. The theoretical mode-coupling analysis suggest {{the use of these}} devices as output <b>port</b> <b>replicators</b> where the dynamics are controlled by the impinging light field. This is confirmed to good agreement with finite element propagation in an experimentally feasible necklace of passive PT-symmetric dimers constructed from lossy and lossless waveguides.

5000|$|Expansion is {{possible}} via a dock connector which connects to a <b>port</b> <b>replicator,</b> offering two USB ports (blocking the single port on the unit), VGA, audio, AC power and Ethernet. A sliding cover {{on the lid}} provides access to a [...] "snap on" [...] expansion system. There is one expansion option provided for this, a 3.2Mp (5Mp marketed) add-on camera. The expansion cover also provides access to the built in SIM socket.|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} of the modern desktop replacement computer came {{with the realization that}} many laptops were used in a semi-permanent location, often remaining connected to an external power source at all times. This suggested that a market existed for a laptop-style computer that would take advantage of the user's reduced need for portability, allowing for higher-performance components, greater expandability, and higher-quality displays. Desktop replacement computers are also often used with a <b>port</b> <b>replicator,</b> to full enjoy the desktop comfort.|$|E

5000|$|The Latitude D8x0 {{series is}} the 15.4" [...] {{corporate}} model; unlike the D600 and D610, all feature a widescreen form factor.

50|$|IBM ThinkPad 380Z — The 380Z was {{the last}} model of the 380 series to be produced. It {{introduced}} the optional 300 MHz Pentium II mobile processor into the line, and included advanced features such as a S.M.A.R.T. hard drive, a larger 13.3 in TFT LCD screen with a maximum resolution of 1024x768 (compared to the 12.1 in, 800x600 maximum on the older models), ACPI support, the integration of higher-quality speakers {{with the addition of}} an internal sub-woofer, and its own <b>port</b> <b>replicator</b> that would only work with the 380Z.|$|E
5000|$|The Latitude D6x0 {{series is}} the 14"/14.1" [...] {{corporate}} model. It aims to combine heavy-duty power with reasonable portability, and differs primarily from D8x0 series in screen size.

It has a 1024x600 pixels, 9" [...] inch resistive LED back-lit touchscreen, which {{has been described as}} [...] "impressive" [...] by reviewers. [...] The device has both 802.11b/g Wifi and Bluetooth 2.1, 1 USB port, and can add an additional 2 USB ports, standard VGA monitor connection, and an Ethernet port via the <b>Port</b> <b>Replicator</b> accessory.|$|E

5000|$|A {{docking station}} (sometimes {{referred}} to {{simply as a}} dock) is a laptop accessory that contains multiple ports, {{and in some cases}} expansion slots or bays for fixed or removable drives. A laptop connects and disconnects to a docking station, typically through a single large proprietary connector. A docking station is an especially popular laptop accessory in a corporate computing environment, due to a possibility of a docking station to transform a laptop into a full-featured desktop replacement, yet allowing for its easy release. This ability can be advantageous to [...] "road warrior" [...] employees who have to travel frequently for work, and yet who also come into the office. If more ports are needed, or their position on a laptop is inconvenient, one can use a cheaper passive device known as a <b>port</b> <b>replicator.</b> These devices mate to the connectors on the laptop, such as through USB or FireWire.|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Use of a notebook computer in an office setting has been implicated as a risk factor for musculoskeletal disorders. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if there were differences in performance, posture, and blink rate between workers using cathode ray tube (CRT) computer monitors vs. a notebook computer flat panel display (FPD). Six combinations of typical CRT workstation configurations were presented to twenty-four subjects according to a Latin Square Crossover Design. The treatments consisted of a notebook computer alone, a notebook computer used with external input devices, monitor blocks, a notebook computer stand, and CRT monitors. Each subject performed two tasks (data entry and editing) for 10 minutes in each configuration-task combination. The results of this study indicate that the use of the notebook alone causes an increase in neck angle and viewing angle, while decreasing viewing distance and elbow angle. Use of the notebook computer elevated to eye level with either monitor blocks or a notebook computer stand alleviated these changes in body posture without affecting the blink rate or user performance of the subjects. Use of a CRT monitor, keyboard, and mouse were still generally preferred over the use of the notebook computer. However, if a user needs or desires a notebook computer and intends to use it in an office setting, the results of this study suggest that if a docking station or <b>port</b> <b>replicator</b> are not available, the notebook computer FPD should be elevated to eye level and used only as a visual terminal while using an external keyboard and mouse as input devices...|$|E
