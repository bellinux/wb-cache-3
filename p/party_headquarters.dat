5|$|During {{the run-up}} to the 2006 Swedish general election, Reinfeldt was {{subjected}} to a smear campaign. Mats Lindström, a staff member in the Social Democratic <b>Party</b> <b>headquarters,</b> admitted to sending e-mails accusing Reinfeldt of tax fraud, false financial declarations and only attaining his position because of his father's influence. The IP address used in the e-mails was traced to the Social Democratic <b>Party</b> <b>headquarters.</b> Social Democratic Party Secretary Marita Ulvskog apologized and said that such behavior was completely unacceptable. A short time after the e-mail campaign, images that depicted Reinfeldt and the Moderate Party in an unflattering light were spread internally within the Social Democratic Party and subsequently leaked to the media. Social Democratic Party spokeswoman Carina Persson confirmed that the material came from the Social Democratic Youth League, but denied the existence of an official smear campaign and stated that the material was not meant to be released or spread to a wider audience.|$|E

5|$|Hitler was {{discharged}} from the army on 31 March 1920 and began working full-time for the NSDAP. The <b>party</b> <b>headquarters</b> was in Munich, a hotbed of anti-government German nationalists determined to crush Marxism and undermine the Weimar Republic. In February 1921—already highly effective at speaking to large audiences—he spoke to a crowd of over 6,000. To publicise the meeting, two truckloads of party supporters drove around Munich waving swastika flags and distributing leaflets. Hitler soon gained notoriety for his rowdy polemic speeches against the Treaty of Versailles, rival politicians, and especially against Marxists and Jews.|$|E

5|$|On 1 August 1931 Heydrich {{began his}} job as chief of the new 'Ic Service' (intelligence service). He set up office at the Brown House, the Nazi <b>Party</b> <b>headquarters</b> in Munich. By October he had created a network of spies and informers for intelligence-gathering {{purposes}} and to obtain information {{to be used as}} blackmail to further political aims. Information on thousands of people was recorded on index cards and stored at the Brown House. To mark the occasion of Heydrich's December wedding, Himmler promoted him to the rank of SS-Sturmbannführer (major).|$|E

His membership in the SS was confirmed seven months later (SS member number 45,326). His regiment was SS-Standarte 37, responsible for guarding the <b>party</b> <b>headquarters</b> in Linz and protecting party speakers at rallies, which would often become violent. Eichmann pursued party activities in Linz on weekends while continuing in his position at Vacuum Oil in Salzburg.|$|E
5|$|Amid {{reports of}} looting, {{concerns}} were {{raised about the}} safety of the antiquities of the famous Egyptian Museum, near the epicenter of the Cairo protests. Egyptian state television announced in the evening that army commandos had secured the museum. Protesters joined soldiers in protecting the museum, situated beside the burning ruling <b>party</b> <b>headquarters.</b> Looters managed to enter during the night from the roof to damage a number of small artifacts, and it was initially reported that they had ripped the heads off two mummies, but subsequent reports claimed that Egypt's top archaeologist had mistaken skulls from other skeletons, and that the mummies were intact.|$|E

5|$|By 1988, Searchlight {{reported}} that the party's membership had declined to around 1,000. Tyndall responded by trying to raise finances, calling for greater sales of their newspaper and increasing the price of membership by 50%. He also promised {{that he would make}} the BNP the largest extreme-right group in the UK and that he would establish a professional headquarters for the party. This was achieved in 1989, as a <b>party</b> <b>headquarters</b> was opened in Welling, Southeast London, an area chosen because it was a recipient of significant 'white flight' from inner London. That year also witnessed the BNP become the most prominent force on the British far-right as the NF collapsed amid internal arguments and schisms.|$|E

5|$|On 14–19 December 1970 mass demonstrations {{against the}} price rises {{broke out in}} the {{northern}} coastal cities of Gdańsk, Gdynia, Elbląg and Szczecin. In violent confrontations at those and other locations 19 public buildings were destroyed or damaged, including the <b>party</b> <b>headquarters</b> in Gdańsk and Szczecin. The PZPR Central Committee was deliberating in Warsaw, but a smaller conference, led by Gomułka, issued an authorization for a limited use of lethal force to defend lives and property. Nevertheless, Gomułka remained determined to impose a forceful resolution of the conflict. Among the leaders of the party who arrived on the coast and directed the local enforcement actions, initially in Gdańsk, were Zenon Kliszko and Stanisław Kociołek. In Gdynia, the soldiers were instructed to prevent protesters from returning to factory buildings; they fired into a crowd of workers emerging from commuter trains. Fatal confrontations took place also in Szczecin. The exact number of people killed in the region in December is not known, but is believed to be higher than the officially given figure of 44.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, Stevens {{was elected}} {{to serve on the}} National Council of the National Woman's Party. The {{following}} year, when Alice Paul returned from a two-year trip to Switzerland to establish the World Woman’s Party (WWP), difficulties arose. Paul experienced both challenges to the direction she was taking the NWP and had personality conflicts with members, including Stevens. When Alva Belmont died in 1933, the bequest she had promised Stevens for years of personal service was instead directed to the NWP. Stevens sued the estate, eventually receiving US$12,000, but she believed that Paul had sabotaged her relationship with Belmont. After Paul's resignation in 1945, Stevens did not support Paul's hand-selected replacement, Anita Pollitzer and led an unsuccessful attempt to challenge her leadership. Pollitzer was seen as a figurehead for Paul and an internal dispute arose over the NWP’s emphasis on the WWP and international rights rather than domestic organizing. During these tensions, a dissenting faction of NWP members tried to take over <b>party</b> <b>headquarters</b> and elect their own slate of officers, but Pollitzer’s claim to leadership was supported by a ruling of a federal district judge.|$|E
5|$|In June 1921, while Hitler and Eckart {{were on a}} {{fundraising}} trip to Berlin, a mutiny {{broke out}} within the NSDAP in Munich. Members of its executive committee wanted to merge with the rival German Socialist Party (DSP). Hitler returned to Munich on 11 July and angrily tendered his resignation. The committee members realised that the resignation of their leading public figure and speaker would {{mean the end of}} the party. Hitler announced he would rejoin on the condition that he would replace Drexler as party chairman, and that the <b>party</b> <b>headquarters</b> would remain in Munich. The committee agreed, and he rejoined the party on 26 July as member 3,680. Hitler continued to face some opposition within the NSDAP: Opponents of Hitler in the leadership had Hermann Esser expelled from the party, and they printed 3,000 copies of a pamphlet attacking Hitler as a traitor to the party. In the following days, Hitler spoke to several packed houses and defended himself and Esser, to thunderous applause. His strategy proved successful, and at a special party congress on 29 July, he was granted absolute powers as party chairman, replacing Drexler, by a vote of 533to1.|$|E

25|$|On 21 August, the {{day before}} the hearing began, 100 members of the group Caring Hong Kong Power (CHKP) planned a march from Victoria Park to Civic <b>Party</b> <b>headquarters</b> in North Point. Roughly 30 or so persons {{belonging}} to Socialist Action and the Chinese University of Hong Kong-alumni-dominated Leftist Reloaded confronted the CHKP members and attempted to prevent them from marching, claiming the CHKP members were promoting racism and discrimination. A scuffle broke out; police attempted to separate the two sides with barricades, but then people present at the scene began to clash with the police themselves. Police then arrested 15 men and four women and removed them from the scene; among them, three refused bail. Another march by CHKP marchers proceeded from Electric Road to the Civic <b>Party</b> <b>headquarters</b> without incident. However, as it was a Sunday, no party members or staff were present at Civic <b>Party</b> <b>headquarters.</b> According to a Ta Kung Pao report, 1,000 people attended that march.|$|E
