5|$|The {{production}} {{of renewable energy}} in Scotland {{is an issue that}} has come to the fore in technical, economic, and <b>political</b> <b>terms</b> during the opening years of the 21st century. The natural resource base for renewable energy is extraordinary by European, and even global standards, with the most important potential sources being wind, wave, and tide.|$|E
5|$|In <b>political</b> <b>terms,</b> the {{practical}} benefits were minimal, the dangers considerable. Less than 2% of Scots were professed Catholics {{who already had}} considerable freedom to practice in private, a point made by James himself. The opening of Catholic chapels in Edinburgh allowing public celebration of the Mass led to riots and made private worship more difficult. Attempts to build support by expanding the measures benefitted dissident Presbyterians while undermining his Episcopalian base. When James failed to get Parliament's approval, he confirmed popular prejudice linking Catholicism and arbitrary rule by using the Royal Prerogative to promote Catholics to key government positions.|$|E
5|$|At the 1906 election, Deakin {{remained}} Prime Minister {{even though}} Labour gained considerably more seats than the Protectionists. When Watson resigned in 1907, Fisher succeeded him as Labour leader, although Hughes and William Spence also stood for the position. Fisher {{was considered to}} {{have a better understanding of}} economic matters, was better at handling caucus, had better relations with the party organisation and the unions, and was more in touch with party opinion. He did not share Hughes' passion for free trade or that of Watson and Hughes for defence (and later conscription). In <b>political</b> <b>terms</b> he was a radical, on the left-wing of his party, with a strong sense of Labour's part in British working-class history.|$|E

5|$|Oases in {{the largely}} desert region lived {{in by the}} Qedarites - such as Dedan, Tayma, and Dumah - played an {{important}} role as sites of settlement, trade, and watering-places. Dumah, a remote desert city to the west, known later as Dumat Al-Jandal and today as al-Jawf, was the most important of these, sitting as it did between the empires of Babylonia and Assyria. Serving as the base for Qedarite religious ceremonies, Dumah's strategic position on the north-south trade route in the area meant that relations with its inhabitants were sought after by both empires, though Dumah and the Qedarites were closer in both geographical and <b>political</b> <b>terms</b> to Babylonia. Those coming from the south and wishing to access Mesopotamia were obliged to pass through Dumah, which also lay on an alternate route to the northwest, leading to the city of Damascus, and from there, on to Assyria and Anatolia.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} {{population of}} the Red River had historically been Métis and First Nation people. Upon his return, Riel found that religious, nationalistic, and racial tensions were exacerbated by an influx of Anglophone Protestant settlers from Ontario. The political situation was also uncertain, as ongoing negotiations for the transfer of Rupert's Land from the Hudson's Bay Company to Canada had not addressed the <b>political</b> <b>terms</b> of transfer. Finally, despite warnings to the Macdonald government from Bishop Taché and the HBC governor William Mactavish that any such activity would precipitate unrest, the Canadian minister of public works, William McDougall, ordered {{a survey of the}} area. The arrival on 20 August 1869 of a survey party headed by Colonel John Stoughton Dennis increased anxiety among the Métis. The Métis did not possess title to their land, which was in any case laid out according to the seigneurial system rather than in English-style square lots.|$|E
5|$|Farnese's attack {{achieved}} {{his goal}} of distracting the Dutch States forces from Maastricht. After the battle, the Spanish Army moved quickly to Turnhout, taking the castle of Grobbendonk on its way and appearing before Masstricht on 8 March, just six days after the battle of Borgerhout. François de la Noue followed the Spanish till Herentals with some troops, but {{when he realized that}} Farnese was to lay siege to Maastricht, {{it was too late for}} him to reinforce the city's garrison. Moreover, mutinies and defections hampered the Dutch efforts to save the city. The English soldiers under John Norrey's orders, who remained out of Antwerp, kidnapped the abbot of St. Michael's Abbey in demand for back pays, and William of Orange's had to mediate to placate them. In <b>political</b> <b>terms,</b> the battle increased the Walloon defections from the States General to the Spanish party in the following months. Emanuel Philibert de Lalaing joined the Spanish Army with 5,000 Walloon troops of the Dutch States army and expelled from Menen a garrison loyal to the States General.|$|E

25|$|While {{his father}} Constantijn had wished his son Christiaan to be a diplomat, {{it also was}} not to be. In <b>political</b> <b>terms,</b> the First Stadtholderless Period that began in 1650 meant that the House of Orange was not in power, {{removing}} Constantijn's influence. Further, he realised that his son {{had no interest in}} such a career.|$|E

25|$|Despite its spiritual importance, in <b>political</b> <b>terms</b> Arabia {{soon became}} a {{peripheral}} region of the Muslim world, in which the most important medieval Islamic states were based at various times in such far away cities as Damascus, Baghdad, Cairo, and Córdoba.

25|$|During the 1930s and 1940s {{when her}} work was published, the {{pre-eminent}} African-American author was Richard Wright. Unlike Hurston, Wright wrote in explicitly <b>political</b> <b>terms,</b> as someone who had become disenchanted with communism, using the struggle of African Americans for respect and economic advancement as both the setting and the motivation for his work. Other popular African-American authors of the time, such as Ralph Ellison, dealt with the same concerns as Wright.|$|E

25|$|In <b>political</b> <b>terms</b> he is a {{partisan}} {{of his native}} Northumbria, amplifying its role in English history over and above that of Mercia, its great southern rival. He takes greater pains in describing events of the seventh century, when Northumbria was the dominant Anglo-Saxon power, than the eighth, when it was not. The only criticism he ventures of his native Northumbria comes in writing {{about the death of}} King Ecgfrith in fighting the Picts at Nechtansmere in 685.|$|E
25|$|A British {{military}} expert, Michael Orr, {{claims that}} the hierarchy had great difficulty in fully understanding the changed situation, due to their education. As graduates of Soviet military academies, they received great operational and staff training, but in <b>political</b> <b>terms</b> they had learned an ideology, rather than a wide understanding of international affairs. Thus, the generals—focused on NATO expanding to the east—could not adapt themselves and the Armed Forces to the new opportunities and challenges they faced.|$|E

Zhuge Liang ostracised Wei Yan and cracked down on him because he wanted to eliminate Wei Yan as a possible obstacle to his appointed successors.|$|E

25|$|The American radical feminist group Redstockings were {{strongly}} opposed to lesbian separatism, seeing interpersonal relationships with men {{as an important}} arena of feminist struggle, and hence seeing separatism as escapist. Like many radical feminists of the time, Redstockings saw lesbianism primarily as a political identity rather than a fundamental part of personal identity, and therefore analyzed it primarily in <b>political</b> <b>terms.</b> Redstockings were also opposed to male homosexuality, which they saw as a deeply misogynistic rejection of women. Redstockings' line on {{gay men and lesbians}} is often criticized as homophobic.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the 16th century, the {{emergence}} of a first autonomous Lebanese Emirate in the southern Mount Lebanon had important impacts in Jebbet Bsharri. In <b>political</b> <b>terms,</b> it ended in 1621 the role of the Muqaddams of Bsharri as the traditional lords of the region being the official representatives of the Ottoman Governor of Tripoli. In economical terms, the southern Mount Lebanon under the stable rule of the Emir Fakhreddine attracted many families who were encouraged by the Emir to establish there. An important migration took place from Jebbet Bsharri to the south but also to Aleppo, Syria.|$|E
25|$|Astrologically speaking, Neptune is {{associated}} with sophistication, dreams, extravagance, artistry, and empathy, but with illusion and vagueness too. Its appearance coincided {{with the discovery of}} anesthetics and hypnotism. In <b>political</b> <b>terms,</b> Neptune was linked to the rise of nationalist movements throughout Europe in countries like Germany, Italy, Hungary, Ireland, and Serbia, seeking independence for their nations inspired by an idealized past of legend. It was also linked to the rise of socialism and the beginnings of the welfare state. Neptune coincided with the utopian ideals of Communism, when Marx and Engels first published 'The Communist Manifesto' in 1848. Neptune also represents the day of Friday, alongside Venus.|$|E
