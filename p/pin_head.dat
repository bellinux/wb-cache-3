50|$|Even though {{years of}} {{experience}} accounts for a good gauge for the appropriate lifting anchor to be used, {{it should not be}} left to the reinforcement fabricators and precast factory personnel to select the lifting anchor. The design engineer should specifically account for the applied loads expected during the lifting, transport and placement (or re-usability requirements) of the element. Flexure, casting bed suction, load direction (axial ‘tensile’, angular ‘sling’, transverse ‘shear’) are also load considerations to be accounted for in the lifting design of the element.The anchor selection, together with additional reinforcement, and rigging arrangements is influenced by:- The dead weight of the element- The number of anchors in the element and the configuration of the anchor- Capacity of the anchor at the specific concrete compressive strengths at time of lift- The dynamic loads applied during lifting (suction to the casting bed, or crane dynamics)- The rigging configurationAll of the above factors must be taken into consideration during the lifting design phase of the element.The weight of the element can be determined by the calculated volume, and using the specific gravity (normal weight reinforced concrete is approximately 24 kN/m3).Establishing the lifting anchor positions will influence the rigging arrangements used and therefore the static analysis of the rigging should be determined. Particular rigging configurations may be more suitable for particular job sites or lifting in place considerations, and the lifting design should denote the assumptions accordingly. For example, the statically determined systems, shown in Figure 3, where the determination of the loads is not always possible.Dynamic loads considered in lifting design are accounted for in two stages; suction to the casting bed on the initial lift and then the dynamic loads induced from crane vibration. These crane impact loads must be accounted for during transportation in the yard and on-site, and the coefficient increases from an overhead gantry crane through to a crane moving over rough terrain. Consideration for the entire transportation loads {{must be taken into account}} during the lifting design.Anchor capacity, or load resistance, should be considered for tensile loads (axial), sling angle (angular) and shear loads (transverse). Consideration of different load combinations may result in wide variations required from the lifting insert. The load directions during production, transport and placement should be considered carefully. Depending on the planned load direction, either a different anchor may be included in the lifting design, alternatively, reinforcement may be included to reduce the possibility of element flexure crack damage. The configuration (size, position and quantity) of this reinforcement should be supplemented to the element reinforcement design to ensure for adequate capacity of the lifting design.Lifting design is influenced by the steel / concrete interaction of the specific anchor selected. Different load cases are considered by the lifting design engineer, such as anchor susceptibility to edge distance, placement sensitivity, and anchor capacity at the specific concrete strength at time of lift. For example, a footed <b>pin</b> <b>head</b> style anchor maybe more susceptible to edge distance than a hairpin style anchor. Or a splayed anchor does not have the same tensile/axial capacity with the equivalent anchor length (effective embedment is greater on a footed anchor than a splayed anchor of equivalent overall length, see figure 4).|$|E

BHOOSHAN SHARMA Department of Plant Pathology, Indira Gandhi Agricultural University, Raipur 492 006 ABSTRACT: The effect of prevailing environmental conditions on spawn run, <b>pin</b> <b>head</b> formation and biological efficiency of Pleurotus djamor was studied continuously for 9 months from February-October 2003 on Paddy, Wheat and Mustard straw. July month took minimum time (6. 75 to 8. 5 days) for spawn run and 10. 5 to 11. 5 days for <b>pin</b> <b>head</b> formation {{and gave the}} highest biological efficiency (45. 2 to 46. 0) on all the three substrates. However, February and March months took more period for spawn run and <b>pin</b> <b>head</b> initiation and yield was less. No spawn run was observed in months of April, May and June. Correlation coefficient analysis showed negative correlation with maximum, minimum and average temperature. It was negative and significant only for the period for spawn run and <b>pin</b> <b>head</b> formation in case of wheat and mustard substrates. Correlation coefficient for biological efficiency was negative and non- significant with maximum, minimum and average temperature in case of paddy and wheat straw substrate, however, mustard straw showed positive and non-significant relationship with minimum temperature.

The pile is modeled as an Euler-Bernoulli beam while the soil medium is modeled using a Winkler subgrade approach. Two analytical solutions are developed to specifically address both steady state and transient loads encountered during dynamic pile testing. After choosing a proper contour integration in the complex plane, inverse integration is evaluated. The steady state solutions are associated to the residues of the integration around the poles while the transient solutions are associated to the integration paths along the contour integration. The derived solutions are applied to a case history for which results of dynamic pile tests are available. Dynamic pile flexion is generated by delivering eccentric impact using a dynamic loading test module. Validity of the proposed solution is discussed basing on geotechnical campaign and recorded pile head bending moment and rotation rate. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht...|$|R
