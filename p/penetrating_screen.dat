This document {{describes a}} series of tests conducted to assess the potential for loss-of-coolantaccident (LOCA) –generated debris to be trapped in the throttle valve downstream of the sump screen. Trapping of debris in the valve has important consequences for emergency-core-coolingsystem (ECCS) operation because it may result in unacceptably high pressure losses in the system and consequent degradation of ECCS performance. Tests have been performed using a range of loadings and compositions of insulation introduced either as a single batch or as a set of successive batches. The tests used a surrogate throttle valve designed to simulate a range of representative valve configurations in use within United States pressurized-water reactors. This test program was the second in {{a series of}} Nuclear-Regulatory-Commission-sponsored tests that were conducted to address the effects downstream of the ECCS sump screens.

5|$|Cinema audiences {{could wear}} {{disposable}} polarized glasses {{to view the}} film, creating the illusion that elements from the film were <b>penetrating</b> the <b>screen</b> to come towards the viewers. The opening sequence makes obvious use of the technique, with the titles flying {{to the forefront of}} the screen, leaving a trail. There are more subtle instances in the film where props are meant to leave the screen. The more obvious examples are in the climactic sequence of the shark attacking the control room and its subsequent destruction. The glass as the shark smashes into the room uses 3D, as does the shot where the shark explodes, with fragmented parts of it apparently bursting through the screen, ending with its jaws. There were many difficulties in making the green screen compositing work in 3D, and a lot of material had to be reshot.|$|R
