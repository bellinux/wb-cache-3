A series hypotheses are set up which are tested through research on British growers and Wholesales of fresh <b>produce</b> <b>undertaken</b> in 1994. The results demonstrate a close association between size of growers marketing organization and channel strategy with large growers more likely to supply range of outlets including ones with more demanding requirements and with smaller growers more dependent on the use of wholesale market. This reflects the competencies of the different seizes of supplier organization and the results demonstrate how the existence of particulars type of channels in turn influences the structure of completion at growers level. The results also show how the nature of the grower- wholesaler relationship locks smaller growers into the dependence on supply of wholesale market...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new general {{platform for the}} simulation of occupants' presence and behaviours. Called No-MASS (Nottingham Multi-Agent Stochastic Simulation platform) the platform takes a selection of well validated stochastic models to generate a synthetic population of agents, predicts their presence and, {{in the case of}} residences also their activities and inferred locations, as well as their use of windows, lights and blinds. A social interaction framework is used to emulate negotiations amongst the members of diverse populations. Furthermore, machine learning techniques allow the agents to learn dynamic behaviours that maximise energy and/ or comfort rewards. This is complemented by a belief-desire-intent framework for the representation of less sophisticated behaviours for which data is scarce. Using the Functional Mockup Interface (FMI) co-simulation standard No-MASS is coupled with EnergyPlus: EnergyPlus parses environmental parameters to No-MASS which in turns parses back the energetic consequences of agents behaviours. Simulations demonstrating the range of results that No-MASS can <b>produce</b> are <b>undertaken</b> and presented...|$|R

40|$|The ways {{in which}} {{individual}} catering appliances were used, {{as well as the}} planning of meal production, have been studied for five catering facilities (namely for 3 canteens, an hotel and a psychiatric hospital). For each kitchen, activity charts were deduced from the observed patterns of use of each appliance. Several of the identified practices, such as switching-on appliances well before necessary, incurred excessive energy consumptions. Other established habits, such as permitting inordinately-long cooking or holding periods for the food at elevated temperatures, increased energy consumptions and adversely affected the quality of the food <b>produced.</b> The <b>undertaken</b> surveys provided evidence for: 1. (i) the need to review existing practices within kitchens, in order to promote the adoption of more efficient operational procedures and equipment use; 2. (ii) the need, as a systematic requirement, to train staff in the effective uses of new appliances; 3. (iii) the incorporation of programmed timers to switch-on, as well as switch-off, equipment and so relieve staff of the worry that these items will not be at the desired temperatures (and so not be available for immediate use) when required; and 4. (iv) the removal from the kitchen of equipment which is no longer needed or is of low efficiency. ...|$|R

40|$|Social, {{economic}} and environmental importance of bio-based economy is rapidly growing and vegetable oils play an important role. About 75 % of global production of vegetable oils derives from commodity oilseeds (i. e., soybean, oil palm, rapeseed), while the remaining 25 % is produced from minor oilseeds characterized by unusual fatty acid composition. The present review aims at analyzing the potentialities of two alternative oilseed crops for Europe, camelina (Camelina sativa) and crambe (Crambe abyssinica), identified as major candidates for the future European bio-based economy as testified by the recently funded EU Project (Horizon 2020) COSMOS (Camelina and crambe Oil crops as Sources of Medium-chain Oils for Specialty oleochemicals).

40|$|Cosmic strings are topological defects {{appearing}} as extended solutions in many high energy physics scenarios. Observation of signatures expected {{due to the}} presence of cosmic string networks could provide critical evidence in distinguishing and constraining fundamental cosmological and particle physics theories. Large scale evolution of cosmic string is well understood but the dynamics influenced by small scale structure remains unclear. Radiation back-reaction is expected to smooth strings, setting the scale of small structure and the size of loops <b>produced.</b> We <b>undertake</b> an investigation of cosmic strings numerically simulated from their underlying field theories, in particular we use the U(1) gauge theory of the Abelian-Higgs model which radiates to massive modes and the global U(1) theory of the Goldstone model which additionally radiates into the massless mode of the Goldstone field. By comparison to the emission of Goldstone bosons we can infer the effects of gravitational radiation, a further important energy loss mechanism for cosmological string, but difficult to simulate. We analyse the scaling properties of the string tangent vector correlation function and loop number density distributions which are expected to follow related power law forms and compare the results for gauge and global strings with a view to deciphering the influence of a massless degree of freedom on these attributes of network evolution. We find that the change in correlation function due to a massless mode can be incorporated by an effective value for the exponent of time by which the scale factor evolves whereby the smoothing due to back-reaction behaves like additional causal damping. From long gauge strings we find no evidence for direct ‘core’-sized loop production, finding instead that our simulations favour radiation into the gauge and Higgs modes and fragmentation of horizon-sized loop...|$|R

The assignments <b>produced</b> by students <b>undertaking</b> the HNC in Social Care and year one students at the initial stage of the BA Social Work programme in Scotland were examined. The findings suggest that students working in social care environments and year one students on the BA Social Work course were able to evidence some critical thinking; however, it was generally quite minimal and limited to certain categories. Whilst there are likely to be diverse opinions within Scotland as to how the new four‐year honours degree in social work is implemented in terms of teaching, assessment and learning, a valuable opportunity may be missed if critical thinking is not a core feature and meaningfully aligned to students' experiences at Further Education and Higher Education...|$|R
40|$|Since its {{independence}} in 1962, Algeria, as an oil <b>producing</b> country, <b>undertook</b> {{the construction of}} a socialist economy supported by heavy industrialisation and substantial investment in human capital. This strategy of development was based on state-led industrialization, after it nationalized almost the whole economy in 1966. However, this policy focused on establishing large state enterprises and investing heavily in the public sector while not allowing any significant role for the private sector. This rapid industrialization resulted in severe inefficiencies in the productive capacity of various industries and generated fiscal imbalances in the mid- 1970 s, which constrained Algeria’s ability to continue its expansionary industrial policy. The reversal of oil and gas prices in 1986 made the situation even worse and the state-owned industrial sector remained a heavy burden for the government because of its low productivity and lack of competitiveness. Under these troublesome and shaky political and economic atmospheres, economic reforms was introduced in the 1990 s in order to change the Algerian business context from one of state-centered, control orientation, to a free, open market orientation. Furthermore, privatization was imposed on the country by the international monetary fund (IMF) supported adjustment program, as one of the main pillars of these economic reforms, and the right tool to rescue the ill functioning economy and make local industries more efficient and globally competitive. Despite a number of years of economic reform and adjustment, the privatization process in Algeria never really took off, and the country’s industrial efficiency is still relatively weak. Rapid decline and deindustrialization characterize the period from 1980 to the present. However, attempts at industrial reforms have not yet started to show any signs of improvement in its performance. Nonhydrocarbon exports account for a small share of total exports (less than 5 percent) and the oil sector remains a dominant feature of Algeria’s economy, making it vulnerable to changes in world oil markets...|$|R
