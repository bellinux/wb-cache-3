50|$|The Arplast Micro'B (Microbe) is a French {{ultralight}} aircraft {{that was designed}} and produced by <b>propeller</b> <b>manufacturer</b> Arplast Helice. It was supplied as a kit for amateur construction or as a complete ready-to-fly-aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Giovanni Magnani (fl. 1913) was a Romanian-Italian {{entrepreneur}} {{who lived in}} Bucharest {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century. In 1911 he fabricated a set of propellers for A Vlaicu II airplane, thus becoming the first <b>propeller</b> <b>manufacturer</b> in Southeast Europe.|$|E
50|$|The GP-5 Sweet Dreams was a Super Sport Class racing {{airplane}} {{designed by}} George Pereira and originally built by Gary Childs. The aircraft was sold once to another builder before being sold to and completed by George Backovich who {{with the help}} of the designer finished it in 2007 following several modifications for its automotive engine conversion, and changing <b>propeller</b> <b>manufacturers.</b> The aircraft was specifically built to race in the Unlimited class at the Reno Air Races.|$|R
50|$|The FDR {{parameter}} {{for the low}} {{propeller pitch}} lights indicate that the left propeller entered the ground control range about 1 sec prior to the right propeller, yet the propeller RPM parameters indicated that both propellers moved simultaneously into the ground control range. The engine, aircraft and <b>propeller</b> <b>manufacturers</b> were in agreement that propeller behaviour in a ground control range during flight was unpredictable. However, from analysis of the DFDR data, {{there was a general}} consensus as to the propeller behaviour.|$|R
50|$|Duke Boats {{was founded}} by Charlie Duke in 1924 under the name Duke & Greavette after Duke {{had worked for the}} Disappearing <b>Propeller</b> Boat Company, <b>manufacturer</b> of the Dippy and Ditchburn Boats. He began in {{partnership}} with Ernie Greavette, who separated in 1926 to begin his own boat company. Duke took over the Port Carling shop and renamed the company Duke Motor Service.|$|R
50|$|Rolls-Royce {{acquired}} a factory previously used by an aircraft <b>propeller</b> <b>manufacturer</b> after World War Two in 1945. The factory, officially known as 'Rolls-Royce Mountsorrel', became a specialist production factory for 'structural and high temperature fabrications', advising on new designs of both aircraft and cars for Rolls-Royce.|$|E
50|$|By 1781, the {{population}} was recorded as '150 dwellings', and by 1840 {{the population}} of Mountsorrel had reached 1,900. During World War II, in 1942, Alvis, an armoured vehicle manufacturer based in Coventry, acquired a factory previously used to produce cardboard boxes in the village after their factory in Coventry was bombed by the Luftwaffe. Alvis built a new factory {{on the site of}} an old brickworks, which DeHavilland, an aeroplane <b>propeller</b> <b>manufacturer,</b> briefly used after the war until Rolls-Royce Limited acquired the site in 1945. The site has since closed and is now covered by housing (see below).|$|E
50|$|With {{headquarters}} at Hartford, Connecticut, {{the holding company}} controlled the stock of the Boeing Airplane Company of Seattle, the Chance Vought Corporation, the Hamilton Aero Manufacturing Company (a <b>propeller</b> <b>manufacturer),</b> and the Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Company, an aeroengine manufacturer. Sikorsky Aviation Corporation, the Stearman Aircraft Company of Wichita, Kansas, and the Standard Steel Propeller Company were added to United's portfolio shortly thereafter, followed by several more airlines brought into the fold. The airline interests were soon grouped under a new management company known as United Air Lines, Inc. However, the individual airlines (as well as the individual companies held by United) continued to operate under their own names.|$|E
40|$|Today 2 Ì† 7 s {{unmanned}} aerial {{vehicles are}} being utilized by numerous {{groups around the}} world for various missions. Most of the smaller vehicles that have been developed use commercially-off-the-shelf parts, and little information about the performance characteristics of the propulsion systems is available in the archival literature. In light of this, the aim of the present research was to determine the performance of various small-scale propellers in the 4. 0 to 6. 0 inch diameter range driven by an electric motor. An experimental test stand was designed and constructed in which the propeller/electric motor was mounted in a wind tunnel for both static and dynamic testing. Both static and dynamic results from the present experiment were compared to those from previous studies. For static testing, the coefficient of thrust, the coefficient of propeller power, and the overall efficiency, defined as the ratio of the propeller output power to the electrical input power, were plotted versus the propeller rotational speed. For dynamic testing, the rotational speed of the propeller was held constant at regular intervals while the freestream airspeed was increased from zero to the windmill state. The coefficient of thrust, the coefficient of power, the propeller efficiency and the overall efficiency were plotted versus the advance ratio for various rotational speeds. The thrust and torque were found to increase with rotational speed, propeller pitch and diameter, and decrease with airspeed. Using the present data and data from the archival and non-archival sources, {{it was found that the}} coefficient of thrust increases with propeller diameter for square propellers where D = P. The coefficient of thrust for a family of <b>propellers</b> (same <b>manufacturer</b> and application) was found to have a good correlation from static conditions to the windmill state. While the propeller efficiency was well correlated for this family of propellers, the goodness of fit parameter was improved by modifying the propeller efficiency with D/P...|$|R
50|$|In May 2013, Mattheus Strieker {{confirmed}} that the V-Prop went out of production some two years earlier. The design rights were sold to Hoffmann Propeller, an established <b>propeller</b> <b>manufacturer</b> in Germany. Hoffman Propeller plans to develop the V-Prop for fitment to certified aircraft {{as well as to}} kit planes. Stefan Bichlmeyr from Technical Engineering at Hoffmann Propeller has said that the firm is working with Thomas Strieker to redesign the VProp system for bigger engines. As of June 2016 this redesign is in process but still not finished. Although the original 5kg two-bladed propeller was effective and was fitted to several European ultralights, Hoffman have suspended any further development. Instead, Hoffmann are focusing on the more lucrative certified aircraft market, and their current prototype is a five-fold heavier (25kg) three-bladed propeller for engines such as the Lycoming O-360.|$|E
50|$|There {{was a major}} {{disagreement}} between the engine manufacturer and the <b>propeller</b> <b>manufacturer</b> over whether the Allison T40-A-2 driveshaft {{was strong enough to}} take the forces caused at high revolutions per minute of the propellers. Allison was predicting that it would be at least four years before a successful powerplant would be delivered. In October 1948, a conference in Dayton, Ohio was addressing the problems of the XB-55 when it was proposed over lunch that the XB-52 (Boeing Model 464), which until that point had been planned with turboprop engines, could be equipped with the forthcoming Pratt & Whitney J57 turbojet engines. Within a week, it was clear that not only would the XB-52 outperform the XB-55, it could be flying at least a year before the XB-55 could be expected to have reliable engines. Also bearing on the decision to abandon the XB-55 program were government funding constraints and the growing realization that the B-47 was becoming more successful than first projected. On 29 January 1949, the Air Materiel Command was directed to cancel the Boeing XB-55 contract.|$|E
40|$|Positioning systems include {{different}} control {{functions for}} automatic positioning and guidance of marine vessels {{by means of}} proper action of the thruster and propeller devices. These may be controllable pitch propeller (CPP) with fixed speed, controllable speed with fixed pitch propeller (FPP), or controllable pitch and speed in combination. The positioning controller computes commanded forces in surge and sway and moment in yaw. The thruster allocation algorithm determines the corresponding force and direction each thruster and propeller device must produce in order to fulfil the positioning controller commands. Conventionally, the final pitch or speed set-point signals are determined from stationary propeller force to speed/pitch relations {{based on data from}} the <b>propeller</b> <b>manufacturer.</b> However, these relations are strongly influenced by the local water flow around the propeller blades, hull design, operational philosophy, vessel motion, waves and water currents.

40|$|Thruster and {{propeller}} devices {{may be of}} {{the type}} controllable pitch propeller (CPP) with fixed speed, controllable speed with fixed pitch propeller (FPP), or controllable pitch and speed in combination. In conventional positioning systems the final thruster pitch or speed set-point signals are determined from stationary propeller-force-to-speed/pitch relations {{based on data from}} the <b>propeller</b> <b>manufacturer.</b> However, these relations are strongly influenced by the local water flow around the propeller blades subject to hull design, operational philosophy, vessel motion, waves and water current. In this paper a method based on torque control and power control of the propeller and thruster devices is presented. Instead of calculating the propeller speed and pitch set-point signals based on stationary functions, the propeller-force-to-moment and-power relations are used. Power and torque control in combination gives a significant improvement in the performance and the stability of the electrical power plant network, while the positioning accuracy and bandwidth are improved as well...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} written in {{fulfilment}} of deliverable D 3. 3 of the EU-FP 7 project HyMAR. Aim of the project is to develop innovative hybrid drive train systems for small and medium size marine vehicles, by exploiting self-pitching propellers. In this context, the present report describes an automated optimal design procedure developed in the project and {{presents the results of}} applying this methodology to a practical self-pitching propeller design exercise. The proposed design procedure combines propeller hydrodynamics models by Blade Element Momentum Theory and Boundary Element Method with a general-purpose numerical optimization platform. Both models and corresponding numerical codes are developed by INSEAN. In the report, results of the validation of computational hydrodynamics models are presented through numerical applications and comparisons with numerical and experimental data from the literature. Next, results of a practical design exercise are presented and discussed. An existing self-pitching propeller model representative of current production by the <b>propeller</b> <b>manufacturer</b> partner of the HyMAR project is chosen as baseline configuration to be re-designed and optimised in terms of hydrodynamic performance. Main objective of the design exercise consists in achieving delivered thrust higher than the baseline in a given range of advance speed while hydrodynamic efficiency should not be lower than the baseline model. Numerical results of this design exercise are presented to demonstrate the capability of the proposed methodology to match design objectives...|$|E
40|$|Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Aerospace EngineeringIncludes bibliographic {{references}} (leaves 82 - 84) Data {{obtained from}} digital flight data recorders installed on {{a fleet of}} 27 Beech 1900 Ds are {{used to assess the}} actual operational environment of propellers on commuter aircraft. The data consists of 910 complete flights and 589 flight hours. Aircraft operations have been separated into three ground operations categories and five flight phases. Parameters that pertain to the propellers are emphasized. Overall aircraft and subsystem usage is also considered to establish the commuter airline flight profile. Overall aircraft usage includes information on flight durations and time within each flight phase, time at various airspeeds and engine torque levels, and flap operations. Flights of commuter aircraft are shown to be of short duration, with the cruise phase accounting for the majority of airborne time. Ground phases highlight the operation of the propellers within prohibited shaft speed ranges. A noticeable length of time is shown to have been spent within these restricted ranges. The usage of reverse thrust during landing rollouts and ground operations is also considered. Reversals upon landing accounted for {{less than half of the}} total number of reverse cycles. The short duration takeoff rotation is shown to impose the most severe operating conditions on the propellers. Aerodynamic parameters indicate large inflow angles into the propeller disk, resulting in the most severe vibratory loads. Engine torque, propeller shaft speed, and airspeed are all considered as contributing factors to the large vibratory loads the propellers experience at takeoff rotation. Information pertaining to the in flight engine and propeller usage is also given, and shows no abnormal usage of these components. Cumulative frequency of occurrence of angle of attack for each of the five flight phases has been normalized per 1000 hours and per nautical mile. Each flight phase is shown to produce a unique pattern of frequency of occurrence of the angle of attack, driven by the associated airspeeds. Another aerodynamic parameter considered while in flight is the upwash angle. Upwash angle has been derived for a variety of aircraft weights and airspeeds. This parameter is shown to have a significant influence on the propeller inflow angle, especially at high aircraft weight and low airspeed conditions. The change in inflow angle due to gusts has also been extracted and normalized per 1000 hours and per nautical mile. This data is given in the form of plots of cumulative frequency of occurrence for each flight phase and altitude. Increasing altitude shows a significant reduction in the frequency and magnitude of variations in angle of attack caused by gusts. The information is presented in statistical formats that could enable the FAA, the <b>propeller</b> <b>manufacturer,</b> and the airline to better understand and control those factors that influence the structural integrity of these components...|$|E
