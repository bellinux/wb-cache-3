Her publications also center around bioenergy and food production in both the cyclical water deficit lands and the highly flooded plains of Bangladesh. The influence of water stress on tomato plants and fruit quality was investigated in a <b>pot</b> <b>experiment.</b> The uptake of nitrogen, sodium, potassium, sulphur, calcium and magnesium was significantly reduced by water stress in the plants. Significant increases in glucose, fructose, sucrose in fruits and proline content in leaves showed some tendency of this crop to adjust osmotically to water stress. Water stress increased the sugar and acid contents (ascorbic, malic and citric acid) of the tomato fruits and thus improved the fruit quality. This study investigates the effects of water stress on moisture content distribution at different soil layers (pot) and on morphological characters of tomato plants. Moisture content distribution was higher at the surface and decreased with increasing stress at all growth stages. Yield and related morphological characters responded better at certain of the field capacity compared when with other treatments. A study was conducted in the experimental field of Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University, in Dhaka, Bangladesh to study the effect of water stress on fruit quality and osmotic adjustment in different types. The plants had a tendency to adjust against drop in potential in soil by producing organic solutes such as glucose, fructose, sucrose and proline. The quality of fruits was improved {{as a result of the}} synthesis of ascorbic acid, citric acid and malic acid. No physical damage due to stress was observed in fruits, which were over 90% red. Another such test conducted studied the effect of water stress on the height, dry matter and yield of few cultivars where it was noticed that the yield was reduced due to stress but no significant difference was observed.|$|E

Based on the results of multiemelent analyses, it was evident that P and Zn were found mainly in the grains, and Ca, Fe, and Mn preferably in the straw. Concentrations in the grains were kept rather constant for Fe, Mn, S, and P, whereas the straw acted as a buffer to store excess mobile amounts. Apart from some differences due to cereal species and cultivars, additional supply of nutrient element fertilizer solution and shorter root length led to higher Cu, Fe, Mn, and Zn in cereals grown in pots, and a shift in the grain/straw ratios for Ca. Thus, the results obtained in <b>pot</b> <b>experiments</b> cannot be directly transferred to fi eld conditions. From at least 5 replicates of each setup, on the average, precision of analytical data obtained for whole grain samples was better than for straw samples, and precision obtained in <b>pot</b> <b>experiments</b> was less than those in fi eld <b>experiments.</b> In <b>pot</b> <b>experiments,</b> increase of the number of replicates from 5 to 10 or 20 did not improve analytical precision...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe water {{requirement}} {{pattern for}} tobacco (Yun 85) was identified based on {{analysis of data}} obtained from <b>pot</b> <b>experiments</b> in a canopy at the Xiuwen Irrigation Test Central Station in Guizhou Province, China. The {{results showed that the}} tobacco water requirement and the tobacco water requirement intensity throughout the growth period in <b>pot</b> <b>experiments</b> were significantly lower than those in field production. In <b>pot</b> <b>experiments,</b> the tobacco water requirement throughout the growth period ranged from 159. 00 to 278. 90 Â mm, with a reduction in the range of 241 â 441 Â mm, as compared with that in field production. Also, the average water requirement intensity at the vigorous growing stage was 1. 97 Â mm/d, and the water requirement and water requirement module were 33. 80 â 72. 60 Â mm and 16. 39 %â 33. 09 %, respectively, at the group stage, almost equal to their values at the vigorous growing stage. The patterns of the tobacco water requirement and water requirement module in <b>pot</b> <b>experiments</b> were different from those in field production. In <b>pot</b> <b>experiments,</b> the tobacco water requirement and water requirement module ranked the highest at the mature stage, followed by those at the group/vigorous growing and rejuvenation stages, while the water requirement intensity ranked the highest at the vigorous growing stage, followed by those at the mature, group, and rejuvenation stages. The pattern of the water requirement intensity in <b>pot</b> <b>experiments</b> was consistent with that in field production. In addition, the response of the tobacco water requirement to water deficit was also analyzed. Serious water deficit at the vigorous growing stage and continuous water stress at the group, vigorous growing, and mature stages can greatly influence the tobacco water requirement. Water deficit led to reductions in the water requirement and water requirement intensity at each growth stage. The vigorous growing stage exhibited the highest sensitivity to water deficit. The lower limit of moderate soil water stress at the vigorous growing stage was 65 % of the field capacity. Results of this study can help to establish a reasonable irrigation schedule for tobacco production in Guizhou Province, China...|$|R
