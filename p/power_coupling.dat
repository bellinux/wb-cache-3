The tube is often cooled either by compressed air (<10 kW) or cooling water. While the transparency of quartz tube is demanded in many laboratory applications (such as spectrum diagnostic), its relatively poor mechanical and thermal properties pose a risk to other parts (e.g., o-ring seals) that may be damaged under the intense radiation of high-temperature plasma. These constraints limit the use of quartz tubes to low power torches only (<30 kW). For industrial, high power plasma applications (30~250 kW), tubes made of ceramic materials are typically used. The ideal candidate material will possess good thermal conductivity and excellent thermal shock resistance. For the time being, silicon nitride (Si3N4) is the first choice. Torches of even greater power employ a metal wall cage for the plasma {{confinement tube}}, with engineering tradeoffs of lower <b>power</b> <b>coupling</b> efficiencies and increased risk of chemical interactions with the plasma gases.|$|E

30|$|In {{an early}} study of family {{migration}} patterns, Costa and Kahn (2000) show that an increasing proportion of America’s <b>power</b> <b>couples</b> (couples where both spouses are college educated {{to at least}} Bachelor level) were found in large metropolitan areas between 1940 (when 32  % were) and 1990 (when 50  % were). Costa and Kahn (2000) argue that this geographical shift for <b>power</b> <b>couples</b> is predominantly due to the greater probability of a successful labour market match for both spouses that larger metropolitan labour markets offer. In their model, <b>power</b> <b>couples</b> are viewed as dual career households {{in the sense that}} both household members aspire to their own careers (Mincer 1978). If <b>power</b> <b>couples</b> are joint decision makers, they face the difficulty of finding jobs that match the skills of each spouse within a reasonable distance from their mutual home. This may lead <b>power</b> <b>couples</b> to concentrate in large metropolitan areas where there are more potential job matches. Increases in the rates of college education and labour market participation amongst women (Goldin and Katz 2008) exacerbate this matching requirement, increasing the polarity across family education patterns found for metropolitan and rural areas.
