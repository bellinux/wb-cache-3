25|$|Hemp, {{because of}} its height, dense foliage and its high <b>planting</b> <b>density</b> as a crop, is a very {{effective}} and long used method of killing tough weeds in farming by minimizing the pool of weed seeds of the soil. Using hemp this way can help farmers avoid the use of herbicides, to help gain organic certification and to gain the benefits of crop rotation. Due to its rapid, dense growth characteristics, in some jurisdictions hemp is considered a prohibited noxious weed, much like Scotch Broom.|$|E
25|$|In {{many cases}} however, lakes and ponds have been {{designed}} as aesthetic features but suffer from poor health which {{can be caused by}} lack of appropriate inflows sustaining lake water levels, poor water quality of inflows and high organic carbon loads, infrequent flushing of the lake (too long residence time), and/or inappropriate mixing (stratification) leading to low levels of dissolved oxygen. Bluegreen algae caused by poor water quality and high nutrient levels can be a major threat to the health of lakes. To ensure the long-term sustainability of lakes and ponds, key issues that should be considered in their design include catchment hydrology and water level, and layout of the pond/lake (oriented to dominant winds to facilitate mixing. Hydraulic structures (inlet and outlet zones) should be designed to ensure adequate pre-treatment and prevent large nutrient ‘spikes' Landscape design, using appropriate plant species and <b>planting</b> <b>density</b> are also necessary. High costs of the planned pond/lake area and of vegetation establishment as well as frequent maintenance requirements can be deterrents to use of ponds and lakes as WSUD measures.|$|E
