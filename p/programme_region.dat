This frequently results in high within-population spacer diversity, {{but it is}} unclear if and why this is important. Here we show that, {{as a result of}} this spacer diversity, viruses can no longer evolve to overcome CRISPR-Cas by point mutation, which results in rapid virus extinction. This effect arises from synergy between spacer diversity and the high specificity of infection, which greatly increases overall population resistance. We propose that the resulting short-lived nature of CRISPR-dependent bacteria-virus coevolution has provided strong selection for the evolution of sophisticated virus-encoded anti-CRISPR mechanisms.

40|$|Introduction: An {{increasing}} {{proportion of}} adult patients initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) in resource-limited settings are aged > 50 years. Older populations on ART {{appear to have}} heightened risk of death, but {{little is known about}} factors influencing mortality in this population. Methods: We performed a retrospective observational multisite cohort study including all adult patients (≥ 15 years) initiating ART between 2003 and 2013 in programmes supported by Médecins Sans Frontières across 12 countries in Asia, Africa and Europe. Patients were stratified into two age groups, > 50 years and 15 to 50 years. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to explore factors associated with mortality. Results: The study included 41, 088 patients: 2591 (6. 3 %) were aged > 50 years and 38, 497 (93. 7 %) were aged 15 to 50 years. The mortality rate was significantly higher in the age group > 50 years [367 (14. 2 %) deaths; mortality rate 7. 67 deaths per 100 person-years (95 % confidence interval, CI: 6. 93 to 8. 50) ] compared to the age group 15 to 50 years [3788 (9. 8 %) deaths; mortality rate 4. 18 deaths per 100 person-years (95 % CI: 4. 05 to 4. 31) ], p 50 age group. WHO Stage 4 conditions were more strongly associated with increased mortality rates in the 15 to 50 age group compared to populations > 50 years. WHO Stage 3 conditions were associated with an increased mortality rate in the 15 to 50 age group but not in the > 50 age group. <b>Programme</b> <b>region</b> did not affect mortality rates in the > 50 age group; however being in an Asian programme was associated with a 36 % reduced mortality rate in populations aged 15 to 50 years compared to being in an African programme. There was a higher overall incidence of Stage 3 WHO conditions in people > 50 years (12. 8 / 100 person-years) compared to those 15 to 50 years (8. 1 / 100 person-years) (p 50 age groups. Conclusions: Older patients on ART in resource-limited settings have increased mortality rates, but compared to younger populations this appears to be less influenced by baseline CD 4 count and WHO clinical stage. HIV treatment programmes in resource-limited settings need to consider risk factors associated with mortality on ART in older populations, which may differ to those related to younger adults...|$|E
40|$|The thesis aims at {{investigating}} the local {{dimension of the}} EU cohesion policy through the utilization of an alternative approach, which aims at the analysis of discourse and structures of power. The concrete case under analysis is the Interreg IV programme 'Alpenrhein-Bodensee-Hochrhein', which is conducted in the border region between Germany, Switzerland, Austria and the principality of Liechtenstein. The main research question is stated as such: What governmental rationalities {{can be found at}} work in the field of EU cross-border cooperation programmes? How is directive action and cooperation envisioned? How coherent are the different rationalities, which are found at work? The theoretical framework is based on a Foucaultian understanding of power and discourse and utilizes the notion of governmentalities as a way to de-stabilize the understanding of directive action and in order to highlight the dispersed and heterogeneous nature of governmental activity. The approach is situated within the general field of research on the European Union connected to basic conceptualisations such as the nature of power, the role of discourse and modes of subjectification. An approach termed 'analytics of government', {{based on the work of}} researchers like Mitchell Dean is introduced as the basic framework for the analysis. Four dimensions (visiblities, subjectivities, techniques/practices, problematisations) are presented as a set of tools with which governmental regimes of practices can be analysed. The empirical part of the thesis starts out with a discussion of the general framework of the European Unions cohesion policy and places the Interreg IV Alpenrhein-Bodensee-Hochrhein programme in this general context. The main analysis is based on eleven interviews which were conducted with different individuals, participating in the programme on different levels. The selection of interview partners aimed at maximising heterogeneity through including individuals from all parts of the <b>programme</b> <b>region,</b> obtaining different functions within the programme. The analysis reveals interesting aspects pertaining to the implementation and routine aspects of work within initiatives conducted under the heading of the EU cohesion policy. The central aspects of an Interreg IV Alpenrhein-Bodensee-Hochrhein – governmentality are sketched out. This includes a positive perception of the work atmosphere, administrative/professional characterisation of the selves and a de-politicization of the programme. Characteristic is the experience of tensions by interview partners and the use of discoursive strategies to resolve them. Negative perceptions play an important role for the specific governmental rationality. The thesis contributes to a better understanding of the local dimension of the European Union cohesion policy and questions established ways of thinking about governmental activity. It provides an insight into the working of power mechanisms in the constitution of fields of discourse and points out matters of practical importance as well as subsequent research questions...|$|E

A {{very small percentage of}} Irish and Welsh GPs (4. 7 % and 10 % respectively) had received training in neuroimaging and the majority who referred patients for neuroimaging were not aware of any dementia-specific protocols for referrals (93. 1 % and 95 % respectively) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{paper is}} based on the {{experience}} from the intermediate evaluations of the three Interreg II A programmes between Sweden and Norway. Two of the three programmes cover extended geographic areas with a low population size. The areas are sparsely populated compared to the Non-Nordic Interreg programmes. The immediate border areas may be more or less uninhabited in some of the <b>programme</b> <b>regions.</b> The population centres are in many cases located quite far from the border, which means that there are great distances between them. The paper focus on the challenges for the Interreg programmes due to these special circumstances. The programmes must adapt methods of implementing the general aims to these conditions. Here, the distinction between «real » cross-border co-operation and regional development programmes {{on each side of the}} border is not so easy to withhold, as it is in continental Europe. One could argue that the low population density in these peripheral areas makes regional development programmes a prerequisite for cross-border co-operation...|$|R

40|$|European Union financed Interreg {{programmes}} {{focusing on}} cross-border region building form {{an important part}} of the EU integration policy. The region building processes involve many fields of action in which destination development is one. In this article, the latest finished programme, Interreg III, will be highlighted with special focus on cross-border regions in the Baltic Sea Area. The purpose is to analyse how regional identities are re-presented and re-negotiated in connection with cross-border tourism destination development. These questions are analysed with the help of a methodology based on storylines using three selected <b>programme</b> <b>regions</b> as case studies. In our analysis we have found three storylines that in different ways enlighten our understanding of these regions' (actual and possible) political identities: the notion of borders, the practice of history and the future-oriented visions. The study reveals the presence of two fundamental and contradictory visions grounded in the European project: regionalisation and internationalisation. It also shows that the cross-border region co-operation processes share a narrative characterised by liberal economic rationality. Political issues are downplayed in relation to economic issues, even though in the case of tourism political issues like regional identity are not possible to avoid...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{this study}} we aim at {{assessing}} the potential of European regions to solar power generation and its comparison with recent European Union (EU) incentives {{for the development of}} this renewable energy source. In {{this study we}} use a multi-criteria assessment (MCA) supported by Geographical Information System (GIS) to combine already existing information on solar radiation with other geographical factors such as slope, land use, urban extent and population distribution, as well as proximity to the power grid to generate a suitability map for photovoltaic (PV) power plants across the EU at high spatial resolution. A validation exercise showed that the resulting suitability map is a good predictor of appropriate locations for the deployment of PV power plants. The suitability map was in addition compared to the regional distribution of European funds for development of solar energy from the EU Cohesion policy (2007 – 2013 <b>programme).</b> <b>Regions</b> were classified according their overall suitability for solar energy power systems and the allocated solar investments by the EU Cohesion policy. This analysis allowed to identify potential mismatches between fund allocations and actual regional suitability for solar energy. It is recommended that future fund allocations take into account suitability criteria for solar energy for optimised results of public policies...|$|R
