500|$|By {{this time}} Conn and Stafford {{were not on}} {{speaking}} terms and it fell to Tom Smythe, Stafford's son, to mediate between the two. Stafford built a new office suite at the Gardens for Conn, and the feud was over. After Stafford was charged in 1971 with fraud and became ill with a stomach ulcer, Conn was with him in hospital when he died. According to Conn, Stafford's last words to him were [...] "see dad, I told you they wouldn't <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> jail." ...|$|E

When you're pregnant, it's {{a little bit harder}} to breathe, so it was hard doing all the choreography and singing at the same time. I just got my strength from all the love from the fans. I can see all of my super fans in the audience when I'm performing because they're doing the choreography harder than me. Some of the fans were like, 'B, you better <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> this DVD.' So I made sure I did." ...|$|E
500|$|Douglas was {{inducted}} into the National Wildlife Federation Hall of Fame in 1999, and the National Women's Hall of Fame in 2000. John Rothchild declared her a feminist before the word existed, but not entirely. Upon hearing that she was to be inducted, she questioned, [...] "Why should they have a Women's Hall of Fame, as I heard they wanted to <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> the other day? Why not a Citizen's Hall of Fame?" [...] Douglas was included in a tribute to pioneering women when television character Lisa Simpson made a papier-mâché bust of her with Georgia O'Keeffe and Susan B. Anthony in an early episode of The Simpsons.|$|E
500|$|Stein {{says he got}} {{the role}} of Bueller's Economics teacher through six degrees of separation. [...] "Richard Nixon {{introduced}} me to a man named Bill Safire, who's a New York Times columnist. He introduced me to a guy who's an executive at Warner Brothers. He introduced me to a guy who's a casting director. He introduced me to John Hughes. John Hughes and I are among the only Republicans in the picture business, and John Hughes <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> the movie", Stein said. Hughes said that Stein was an easy and early choice {{for the role of}} the teacher: [...] "He wasn't a professional actor. He had a flat voice, he looked like a teacher." ...|$|E

500|$|While Gardner {{intermittently}} {{continued to}} go to the industrial school, he met Debra Bischoff at a Salt Lake City apartment complex where his mother lived. Bischoff described him as: [...] "Very caring. He never <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> the rough situations he was in throughout his life. He sheltered me from that stuff." [...] Gardner had a daughter in May 1977 and a son in February 1980 with Bischoff, but was convicted of robbery and sent to Utah State Prison in the same month his son was born. Gardner successfully escaped the prison's maximum security unit on April 19, 1981, and was shot in the neck while attempting to kill a man who he believed had raped Bischoff. In February 1983, he was identified as a ringleader in a disturbance in which inmates barricaded a cell block and started fires.|$|E
500|$|... "Zoo Station" [...] came {{together}} {{near the end}} of the recording sessions when audio engineer Flood was mixing the song and introduced distortion to the drums. The song's direction was largely influenced by the production team of Daniel Lanois, Brian Eno, and Flood. Lead vocalist Bono had been disappointed with his vocals from early recording sessions for the album and told the production team, [...] "Let's just try something that's gonna <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> a completely different place". After they distorted his voice to make it sound as if it were coming from a megaphone, Bono was inspired to sing in a persona, as the effect gave his vocals a different [...] "emotional feel". Flood mixed the final track with the assistance of Shannon Strong. Along with Robbie Adams, Strong also assisted Flood with engineering. Lanois provided additional guitar during recording.|$|E
500|$|Priyanka Chopra {{was cast}} as series protagonist Alex Parrish, {{the result of}} a talent holding deal with ABC Studios which {{required}} the company to develop a starring project for her or cast her in an existing project for the 2015 television season. ABC casting executive Keli Lee had long tried to persuade Chopra to perform on television in the United States. When the actress began considering U.S. TV, Lee learned that Chopra had been approached by another studio: [...] "I said , 'No, you can't make this deal elsewhere. You're coming here. And I'm flying to India. Lee went to India and convinced Chopra to accept ABC's offer. The actress said about Lee: [...] "I told her, the only way I would do it is if you find me a show and a path which first will <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> the same position that I am in India".|$|E

500|$|During a {{subsequent}} NPR talk show, Savage {{said that he}} has never advocated violence and repeatedly invoked the United States Constitution's First Amendment. After host Neal Conan pointed out that the U.S. Constitution does not apply to the United Kingdom, Savage replied, [...] "No. Thank God I'm an American. But for this lunatic... to link me up with Nazi skinheads who are killing people in Russia... to <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> league with Hamas murderers who killed Jews on buses, is astonishing". Savage also called on his listeners to support him by canceling travel and business in Britain as well as by boycotting British-made goods, commenting, [...] "If they want to play hardball, we'll play hardball." [...] When a caller challenged Savage about his talk show rhetoric, Savage called him a [...] "foaming lunatic... someone in pajamas in a mental asylum... You're nobody and I'm not going to talk to you!" [...] At that point, Neal Conan invited him to leave.|$|E
500|$|Dworkin's {{work from}} the early 1980s onward {{contained}} frequent condemnations of incest and pedophilia {{as one of the}} chief forms of violence against women, arguing once that [...] "incest is terrifically important in understanding the condition of women. It is a crime committed against someone, a crime from which many victims never recover". In the early 1980s she had a public row with her former friend Allen Ginsberg over his support for child pornography and pedophilia, in which Ginsberg said, [...] "The right wants to <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> jail," [...] and Dworkin responded, [...] "Yes, they're very sentimental; I'd kill you." [...] In 1985, When Hustler published the claim that Dworkin advocated incest, Dworkin sued them for defamatory libel; the court dismissed Dworkin's complaint on the grounds that regardless of whether Hustlers interpretations of her reflections on incest were valid, even a faulty interpretation of a work placed into the [...] "marketplace of ideas" [...] could not amount to defamation in the legal sense.|$|E
500|$|In 1916, Coach Yost {{shared his}} {{recollections}} of the Buffalo game with Big Bill Edwards: [...] "Buffalo University came to Michigan with a much-heralded team. They were coached by a Dartmouth man {{and had not}} been scored upon. Buffalo papers referred to Michigan as the Woolly Westerners, and the Buffalo enthusiasts placed bets that Michigan would not score." [...] The score {{at the end of}} the first half was 65 to 0. About fifteen minutes after the second half had started, Yost discovered a Buffalo player, Simpson, [...] "on Michigan's side of the field, covered up in a blanket." [...] Yost was curious and asked, [...] "Simpson, what are you doing over here? You are on the wrong side." [...] To which, Simpson replied, [...] "Don't say anything. I know where I am at. The coach has <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> three times already and I'm not going in there again. Enough is enough for any one. I've had mine." ...|$|E

500|$|Because the CW is a fashion-orientated network, {{there were}} times Nikita had to be dressed {{in a certain way}} to get her noticed by her targets. Q liked the idea, {{but at the same time}} wanted Nikita's dress sense to be [...] "toned down a bit" [...] because she is an assassin. In one scene in {{particular}} Q had to wear a red bikini in the pilot, which [...] "mortified" [...] her. She added [...] "that red bikini was the bane of my existence. You're not going to see me in a bikini again, that's for sure. [...] I was like, 'Danny, can you <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> a one-piece?,' and he gave me that red bikini. I was like, 'That's not a one-piece. That's a two-piece with a string.'" [...] However, Q did not have to cover her tattoos like she had to in the films, as it was in keeping with who the character is; a hardcore, street kid.|$|E
500|$|The {{reference}} to basketball player Steve Nash in the song's lyrics led to speculation {{that he and}} Furtado were romantically involved, but both deny the link with Nash commenting, [...] "I'm flattered that she <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> her song, but I'm completely {{in love with my}} wife and two little baby girls". Furtado decided to include him because she and Nash are both from Victoria, British Columbia, and due to frequent citations of basketballers in songs, she decided to [...] "give him the props". In one of the verses Timbaland introduces himself as Thomas Crown. The Thomas Crown Affair is a film about wealthy businessman who plays a cat-and-mouse/flirting game with an insurance investigator. Timbaland only performed the song live on special occasions, such as Furtado's appearance on Saturday Night Live, and the 2006 MuchMusic Video Awards. Starting with Furtado's show at the 94th Grey Cup on 19 November 2006, and extending into the Get Loose Tour, Timbaland's part is filled in by Canadian rapper Saukrates.|$|E
500|$|Rikky Rooksby, {{author of}} The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna {{felt that the}} lyrics, along with being an answer-song, could also be {{interpreted}} as a rebellious one, where Madonna looks back on a relationship where she was not allowed to speak her mind. The song's lyrics contain sarcastic backing vocals with Madonna asking rhetorical questions based on her real-life actions, such as [...] "Did I say something wrong? Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about sex. I must have been crazy," [...] as well as the line [...] "What was I thinking?" [...] Madonna explained that the lyrics were about [...] "basically saying don't <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> a box, don't pin me down, don't tell me what I can and can't say. It's about breaking out of the restraints." [...] With the Los Angeles Times she further clarified that there was a defensiveness with the lyrics for [...] "Human Nature": ...|$|E

500|$|Abrams {{contacted}} Pegg by e-mail, {{offering him}} the part. To achieve Scotty's accent, Pegg was assisted {{by his wife}} Maureen, who is from Glasgow, although Pegg said that Scotty was from Linlithgow and that he therefore wanted his accent to sound more East Coast Scottish. As a result, the accent he used {{is a mixture of}} both, although it leans more towards the West sound. He was also aided by James Doohan's son, Chris, and Tommy Gormley, the film's Glaswegian first assistant director. Pegg described Scotty as a positive Scottish stereotype, noting [...] "Scots are the first people to laugh at the fact that they drink and fight a bit", and that Scotty comes {{from a long line of}} Scots with technical expertise, such as John Logie Baird and Alexander Graham Bell. Years before, Pegg's character on Spaced joked that every odd-numbered Star Trek film being [...] "shit" [...] was a fact of life. Pegg noted [...] "Fate <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> the movie to show me I was talking out of my ass." ...|$|E
500|$|The fight scene between Jack and Ethan was {{performed}} by the actors themselves. The two were given the freedom to set up how their characters would fight each other. However, stunt coordinator Michael Vendrell wanted Ethan to be [...] "as feral as possible; no school of combat, karate, kung-fu." [...] Before filming the scene where Jack finds Charlie, episode director Stephen Williams scouted for a suitable location and found [...] "what looked like a cathedral," [...] because of the layout of trees behind where Charlie was hung. Monaghan had to be harnessed to a cable for roughly four to five hours. The actor described the scene; [...] "they <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> the tree and I just hung there. I just hung limp. I tried to fall asleep, I tried to relax. When everything was going on, when they cut me down from the tree, when [...] was trying to revive me, when [...] was crying, I really didn't hear any of it. I just was in a semi-meditative state; however close that I could get with someone smacking me in the chest.|$|E
500|$|In January 2006, nine tracks {{recorded}} for the album were {{leaked to the}} Internet. In response to the leak, Garrett Tierney stated [...] "I would say it {{did it in a}} good way 'cause so many people were curious to hear what we have been doing—and for the most part, the record tracks don't sound anything like the leaked demos." [...] However, Lacey was not so upbeat when asked, saying, [...] "For me it was different. It had me pretty down for a while. No one likes to show their creation in mid-process, and those songs weren't done. They were like blueprints. Just the plan, right? It <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> a state where I {{was under the impression that}} those songs had been wasted or something—that we had to go and write new things because those had been heard. Now, in retrospect, I want those songs to be on the album and many of them aren't, and I'm probably more to blame for that than anyone. This record already feels incomplete to me without those tracks and probably will forever." ...|$|E
