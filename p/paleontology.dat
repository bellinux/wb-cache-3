5|$|As {{knowledge}} has increased, <b>paleontology</b> has developed specialised subdivisions. Vertebrate <b>paleontology</b> concentrates on fossils of vertebrates, {{from the earliest}} fish to the immediate ancestors of modern mammals. Invertebrate <b>paleontology</b> deals with fossils of invertebrates such as molluscs, arthropods, annelid worms and echinoderms. Paleobotany focuses {{on the study of}} fossil plants, but traditionally includes the study of fossil algae and fungi. Palynology, the study of pollen and spores produced by land plants and protists, straddles the border between <b>paleontology</b> and botany, as it deals with both living and fossil organisms. Micropaleontology deals with all microscopic fossil organisms, regardless of the group to which they belong.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} <b>paleontology</b> traces {{the history of}} the effort to {{understand}} the history of life on Earth by studying the fossil record left behind by living organisms. Since it is concerned with understanding living organisms of the past <b>paleontology</b> can be considered to be a field of biology, but its historical development has been closely tied to geology and the effort to understand the history of Earth itself.|$|E

5|$|<b>Paleontology</b> even {{contributes}} to astrobiology, {{the investigation of}} possible life on other planets, by developing models of how life may have arisen and by providing techniques for detecting evidence of life.|$|E
5|$|<b>Paleontology</b> lies on {{the border}} between biology and geology, but differs from {{archaeology}} in that it excludes the study of anatomically modern humans. It now uses techniques drawn {{from a wide range of}} sciences, including biochemistry, mathematics, and engineering. Use of all these techniques has enabled paleontologists to discover much of the evolutionary history of life, almost all the way back to when Earth became capable of supporting life, about 3.8 billion years ago. As knowledge has increased, <b>paleontology</b> has developed specialised sub-divisions, some of which focus on different types of fossil organisms while others study ecology and environmental history, such as ancient climates.|$|E
5|$|The Redpath Museum houses {{collections}} {{of interest to}} ethnology, biology, <b>paleontology,</b> and mineralogy/geology. Built in 1882, the Redpath is the oldest building in Canada built specifically to be a museum.|$|E
5|$|The {{results of}} <b>paleontology</b> have {{also contributed to}} the {{development}} of evolutionary theory. In 1944 George Gaylord Simpson published Tempo and Mode in Evolution, which used quantitative analysis to show that the fossil record was consistent with the branching, non-directional, patterns predicted by the advocates of evolution driven by natural selection and genetic drift rather than the linear trends predicted by earlier advocates of neo-Lamarckism and orthogenesis. This integrated <b>paleontology</b> into the modern evolutionary synthesis. In 1972 Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould used fossil evidence to advocate the theory of punctuated equilibrium, which maintains that evolution is characterized by long periods of relative stasis and much shorter periods of relatively rapid change.|$|E
5|$|There are {{relatively}} sparse inclusions of fossilized marine fauna {{found in the}} Marcellus, but these fossils are still important to <b>paleontology.</b> For example, the Marcellus contains the oldest known diverse collection of thin-shelled mollusks still having well preserved shell microstructure.|$|E
5|$|While the dinosaur-bird {{connection}} (or lack thereof) {{was being}} pursued in <b>paleontology,</b> {{the problem of}} the evolution of flight was under scrutiny as well. It was observed that a number of animals with moderate flying or gliding ability, such as bats, flying lizards and flying squirrels have arboreal lifestyles. This led to the idea that the ancestors of birds must have gradually acquired the ability to fly from leaping among branches in the tops of trees. The Hungarian paleontologist Franz Nopcsa proposed an alternate hypothesis in 1907, arguing that the ancestors of birds were fast-running, bipedal animals related to theropod dinosaurs. When Heilmann came onto the <b>paleontology</b> scene, these two sets of conflicting theories provided the framework for his research and eventual conclusions.|$|E
5|$|As an {{important}} cultural centre, Cluj-Napoca has many theatres and museums. The latter include the National Museum of Transylvanian History, the Ethnographic Museum, the Cluj-Napoca Art Museum, the Pharmacy Museum, the Water Museum and the museums of Babeș-Bolyai University—the University Museum, the Museum of Mineralogy, the Museum of <b>Paleontology</b> and Stratigraphy, the Museum of Speleology, the Botanical Museum and the Zoological Museum.|$|E
5|$|Burney was {{reluctant}} to publish the study {{for fear of being}} labeled a cryptozoologist, but eventually published the results in American Anthropologist. Burney concluded that while the villagers had possibly encountered a Malagasy hippopotamus, it was also possible that the stories were inaccuratea combination of misidentified animals, old folk traditions, and information the villagers had gathered from modern <b>paleontology.</b>|$|E
5|$|Entry to the {{protected}} area, including the lake, {{is controlled by}} the Australian government. Permits are strictly issued only for specific scientific research in the field of <b>paleontology,</b> paleoclimate, geology, geomorphology, glaciology, biology and limnology. Visits for educational or cultural reasons, which are mandatory within a defined management plan, are also permitted. Any such visit must not cause harm to the ecological or scientific values of the area.|$|E
5|$|Evolutionary {{biology is}} partly based on <b>paleontology,</b> which uses {{the fossil record}} to answer {{questions}} about the mode and tempo of evolution, and partly on the developments in areas such as population genetics. In the 1980s, developmental biology re-entered evolutionary biology after its initial exclusion from the modern synthesis through the study of evolutionary developmental biology. Phylogenetics, systematics, and taxonomy are related fields often considered part of evolutionary biology.|$|E
5|$|Knowledge about dinosaurs {{is derived}} {{from a variety of}} fossil and non-fossil records, {{including}} fossilized bones, feces, trackways, gastroliths, feathers, impressions of skin, internal organs and soft tissues. Many fields of study contribute to our understanding of dinosaurs, including physics (especially biomechanics), chemistry, biology, and the earth sciences (of which <b>paleontology</b> is a sub-discipline). Two topics of particular interest and study have been dinosaur size and behavior.|$|E
5|$|Most {{scientists}} {{of the day}} recoiled to find that Cope's feud with Marsh had become front-page news. Those closest to the scientific fields under discussion, geology and vertebrate <b>paleontology,</b> certainly winced, particularly as they found themselves quoted, mentioned, or misspelled. The feud was not news to them, for it had lurked at their scientific meetings for two decades. Most of them had already taken sides.|$|E
5|$|Other recent, but undescribed, discoveries {{include a}} {{complete}} skull from the Cloverly of Montana {{and a huge}} fragmentary skeleton from the Cedar Mountain Formation of Utah. These discoveries have been published only as abstracts for the annual Society of Vertebrate <b>Paleontology</b> conference, and {{may or may not}} prove to belong to S. edwardsorum or even Sauropelta when formally published.|$|E
5|$|<b>Paleontology</b> {{is one of}} the {{historical}} sciences, along with archaeology, geology, astronomy, cosmology, philology and history itself. This means that it aims to describe phenomena of the past and reconstruct their causes. Hence it has three main elements: description of the phenomena; developing a general theory about the causes of various types of change; and applying those theories to specific facts.|$|E
5|$|Pterosaurs {{have been}} a staple of popular culture {{for as long as}} their cousins the dinosaurs, though they are usually not {{featured}} as prominently in films, literature or other art. Additionally, while the depiction of dinosaurs in popular media has changed radically in response to advances in <b>paleontology,</b> a mainly outdated picture of pterosaurs has persisted since the mid 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept for}} the Fuchikoma came from one climactic {{scene of the}} film: the battle between Motoko Kusanagi and the big spider-like tank in the museum of <b>paleontology.</b> Based on this tank design, mecha creators Shōji Kawamori and Atsushi Takeuchi made a smaller version, {{designed}} for one person, {{that would be used}} by the police. Thus, the player becomes the pilot of one of these combat machines.|$|E
5|$|The {{first half}} of the 19th century saw {{geological}} and paleontological activity become increasingly well organised with the growth of geologic societies and museums and an increasing number of professional geologists and fossil specialists. Interest increased for reasons that were not purely scientific, as geology and <b>paleontology</b> helped industrialists to find and exploit natural resources such as coal.|$|E
5|$|These {{allegations}} {{were brought to}} the attention of the Ethics Education Committee of the Society of Vertebrate <b>Paleontology</b> (SVP) in 2007, and a response was given in 2008. In regard to Redondasuchus, the SVP found no plagiarism involved, while in the case of Heliocanthus and Rioarribasuchus, the SVP did not try to resolve the issue.|$|E
5|$|Two 20th century {{developments}} in geology {{had a big}} effect on <b>paleontology.</b> The first was the development of radiometric dating, which allowed absolute dates to be assigned to the geologic timescale. The second was the theory of plate tectonics, which helped {{make sense of the}} geographical distribution of ancient life.|$|E
5|$|A second {{specimen}} {{discovered at}} the same locality represents a partially articulated skeleton that is only lacking the tail. Likewise stored at the IVPP, the specimen has the collection number IVPP V13898. The specimen was described in a brief correspondence authored by Li, Olivier Rieppel, and Michael LaBarbera that was published by Science in September 2004; a more detailed description was subsequently published by Rieppel, Li, Nicholas Fraser in a 2008 Journal of Vertebrate <b>Paleontology</b> paper.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>paleontology</b> became {{established}} around 1800, earlier thinkers {{had noticed}} {{aspects of the}} fossil record. The ancient Greek philosopher Xenophanes (570–480 BC) concluded from fossil sea shells that some areas of land were once under water. During the Middle Ages the Persian naturalist Ibn Sina, known as Avicenna in Europe, discussed fossils and proposed a theory of petrifying fluids on which Albert of Saxony elaborated in the 14th century. The Chinese naturalist Shen Kuo (1031–1095) proposed a theory of climate change based {{on the presence of}} petrified bamboo in regions that in his time were too dry for bamboo.|$|E
5|$|At present, the {{building}} houses administrative offices and the university's geological museum. The museum, {{one of the}} oldest collegiate geology collections in the United States, was founded by state geologist and Rutgers professor George Hammell Cook in 1872. Its exhibits showcase the natural history of New Jersey; focusing geology, <b>paleontology,</b> and anthropology. Exhibits include fluorescent zinc minerals from Franklin and Ogdensburg, a mastodon from Salem County, a dinosaur trackway discovered in Towaco, and a Ptolemaic era Egyptian mummy.|$|E
5|$|Augustin Pyramus de Candolle also spelled Augustin Pyrame de Candolle (4 February 1778 – 9 September 1841) was a Swiss botanist. René Louiche Desfontaines {{launched}} de Candolle's botanical {{career by}} recommending him at an herbarium. Within {{a couple of}} years de Candolle had established a new genus, and he went on to document hundreds of plant families and create a new natural plant classification system. Although de Candolle's main focus was botany, he also contributed to related fields such as phytogeography, agronomy, <b>paleontology,</b> medical botany, and economic botany.|$|E
5|$|Bone Sharps, Cowboys, and Thunder Lizards: A Tale of Edward Drinker Cope, Othniel Charles Marsh, and the Gilded Age of <b>Paleontology</b> (2005) is {{a graphic}} novel written by Jim Ottaviani and {{illustrated}} by the company Big Time Attic. The book tells a slightly fictionalized account of the Bone Wars, a period of intense excavation, speculation, and rivalry {{which led to a}} greater understanding of dinosaurs in the western United States. This novel is the first semi-fictional work written by Ottaviani; previously, he had taken no creative license with the characters he depicted, portraying them strictly according to historical sources.|$|E
5|$|Cook {{established}} the university's geology museum in 1872 with specimens {{collected during the}} New Jersey Geological Survey which he directed as New Jersey's state geologist. Since then, the museum has operated on the building's second floor, offering free tours to small groups, schools, and to the general public. The museum's collections, of which {{only a small portion}} is on display, feature exhibits on geology, natural history, <b>paleontology,</b> and anthropology, with an emphasis on the natural history of New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|Edmontosaurus {{has had a}} {{long and}} {{complicated}} history in <b>paleontology,</b> having spent decades with various species classified in other genera. Its taxonomic history intertwines at various points with the genera Agathaumas, Anatosaurus, Anatotitan, Claosaurus, Hadrosaurus, Thespesius, and Trachodon, and references predating the 1980s typically use Anatosaurus, Claosaurus, Thespesius, or Trachodon for edmontosaur fossils (excluding those assigned to E. regalis), depending on author and date. Although Edmontosaurus was only named in 1917, its oldest well-supported species (E. annectens) was named in 1892 as a species of Claosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Gould {{began his}} higher {{education}} at Antioch College, graduating {{with a double}} major in geology and philosophy in 1963. During this time, he also studied at the University of Leeds in the United Kingdom. After completing graduate work at Columbia University in 1967 {{under the guidance of}} Norman Newell, he was immediately hired by Harvard University where he worked until {{the end of his life}} (1967–2002). In 1973, Harvard promoted him to professor of geology and curator of invertebrate <b>paleontology</b> at the institution's Museum of Comparative Zoology.|$|E
