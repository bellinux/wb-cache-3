The player's craft is <b>pre-equipped</b> with some upgrades - weapons and a time-accelerator - so that players can defend themselves from the beginning, although the weapons you start out with are useless against most of enemy ships. The player can leave the ship and space walk in a space suit, purchase new ships from shipyards, and even capture enemy ships that can be flown by the player.|$|E
50|$|A {{possible}} {{distinction is}} that a screw is designed to cut its own thread; it has no need for access from or exposure {{to the opposite side}} of the component being fastened to. This definition of screw is further reinforced by the consideration of the developments of fasteners such as Tek Screws, with either round or hex heads, for roof cladding, self-drilling and self-tapping screws for various metal fastening applications, roof batten screws to reinforce the connection between the roof batten and the rafter, decking screws etc.On the other hand, a bolt is the male part of a fastener system designed to be accepted by a <b>pre-equipped</b> socket (or nut) of exactly the same thread design.|$|E
50|$|The series 7400-7499, 7500-7619, 7620-7881 {{was built}} and {{delivered}} between 2002-2005 and runs with a Detroit Diesel Series 50 {{exhaust gas recirculation}} engine. Some noticeable modifications would be {{the removal of the}} stop request strips which were mounted on the walls. Because of the engine, there is a raised middle seat in the very back row and the fleet came <b>pre-equipped</b> with UWE connectors, which allow the bus to be stored outside rather than inside a garage where the line connected to the bus supplies the bus with heat, to keep the interior and engine warm. Several complaints included frequent breakdowns; rear doors closing slowly; a poor power-to-weight ratio, requiring a lot of effort during acceleration; and a tendency to pollute a bit more than later models.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the first}} {{examples}} of a public transport vehicle that was developed specifically for one-man operation is the Birney streetcar introduced in the United States in 1916. The Birney was <b>pre-equipped</b> {{with one of the}} most important safety devices for enabling one-man operation - the dead man's switch. At the time (and to a certain extent also today) one of the most cited arguments against one-man operation was the safety risks to passengers and bystanders if the driver fell ill. The dead man switch ensured that the tram would stop in the event of an incapacitated driver. For this reason, the Birneys were also called [...] "safety cars". Another critical feature of the Birney in dealing with safety issues from the critics of one-man operation was its compact size which eased the drivers view of the road and reducing the number of doors to a single one.|$|E
5000|$|Real-time {{locating}} is {{a vehicle}} tracking or fleet tracking system using Global Positioning System (GPS) technology. NJ Transit (NJT) is expanding real-time service information for bus customers to all routes {{in the state}} using what has been dubbed [...] "smart bus" [...] technology that can provide real-time bus location and arrival information to web-enabled devices and to “next bus” signage at key locations. In February 2011, NJT authorized a $22 million contract with Clever Devices LTD to install devices on 1,040 buses serving NJT-operated routes. In November 2011, it authorized another $6 million for Clever Devices to equip NJT contracted bus routes with the devices. Completion of the installation is projected for 2013. More than 1,100 new buses coming on line during the period are <b>pre-equipped,</b> thus making the entire fleet [...] "real-time" [...] capable. Real-time customer use was begun with a pilot involving the Trenton and Princeton areas on routes numbered 600 in December 2012. The [...] "MyBus Now" [...] service allows those with smart phones and computers to access NJT's website to see in-transit buses and expected arrival times for those buses within 30 minutes of a bus stop. Commuters can also text MyBus (69287) with the stop and route number to get the arrival time of the next bus. The service was expanded in 2013 to more than 150 NJT routes for Atlantic City, Camden, Philadelphia, and intrastate routes in North Jersey. It will be expanded to buses traveling to the Port Authority Bus Terminal and the George Washington Bridge Bus Station in early 2014.|$|E
50|$|When {{the player}} starts the game, they are {{introduced}} to the battle system via a story relevant tutorial. The player receives a saurian dragon <b>pre-equipped</b> with a weapon and a reflector. A powerful dragonsage comes by and shows the player character his dragon and asks to spar. He doesn't {{take no for an}} answer. It is impossible to defeat this dragon and as a result the player's dragon dies. You can then go to the Cloning Lab and are able to raise as many dragons as you want. The goal of the game is to win in tournaments and get up to the highest rank to defeat the man who first defeated you. Winning in tournaments gives the player money, prestige, and access to better equipment as well. Inside this world, there is an in-game clock and calendar that changes with time passed in the various locations on the map. The day begins at 6 AM and ends at 9 PM, when the player is assumed to sleep. Shops and tourneys close at certain times of the day, so there is a limit on how much the player can accomplish in one day. Tourneys end at 3 PM, and each tourney depending on the rank challenged could take up at least 3 hours of in game time. The player can also choose to speed up time by choosing to sleep at their apartment for a number of hours or a day. There are a few major areas in the city in which the player has access to, each with a notable NPC. They include the cloning lab, an apartment for item and money storage, a weapon/shield shop, the official arena, the junk shop for discount/rare weapons, the sanctuary for capturing/releasing dragons, a training area, and an unofficial arena for battling.|$|E
5000|$|The {{player is}} {{depicted}} as a character on-screen performing at a public venue. The words to the song scroll right-to-left {{at the bottom of}} the screen, above a piano roll representation of the relative pitches at which they are to be sung (the game calls these [...] "note tubes"). At the left end of this area, a [...] "pitch arrow" [...] shows the pitch which the player is singing and provides feedback on whether s/he's hitting the notes. A [...] "crowd meter" [...] shows the mood of the crowd as the player sings; if s/he does a good job of hitting notes on-pitch then the crowd will cheer more loudly and clap in rhythm with the song, and the scene will become more vividly animated. If the crowd meter falls all the way to the lowest rating, the audience will boo the character off-stage and the game is over. New to this iteration of the series is a deep character customization mode, in which players can change facial features, age, ethnicity and weight, along with various clothes and full outfits that comes <b>pre-equipped</b> with some accessories. Also new is a venue customization mode. This allows players to create their own custom stage to sing in, using pyrotechnics, lights, special effects, screens, and more. The game comes pre-packaged with 10 venues, including a Rockabilly theme, a Tiki Torch theme, a Hollywood Glamour theme, and an Outer Space theme. Players can edit these venues, or create their own, with 6 save spaces for custom venues. Also new is the addition of original music videos, which are available for all 50 songs in the track list.The game comes pre-packaged with a USB Logitech microphone, but it will be compatible with all major gaming mics*, including mics from Rock Band, Guitar Hero, Lips and SingStar.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Nowadays, most {{smartphones}} come <b>pre-equipped</b> with loca-tion (GPS) sensing capabilities, allowing {{developers to}} create a wide vari-ety of location-aware applications and services. While location awareness provides novel features and functionality, it {{opens the door to}} many pri-vacy nightmares. In many occasions, however, users do not need to share their actual location, but to determine whether they are in proximity to others, which is practically one bit of information. Private proximity protocols allow this functionality without any further information leak-age. In this work we introduce a novel protocol which is far more efficient than {{the current state of the}} art and bases its security on lattice-based cryptography...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen huge advancements in the methods {{available}} and used in neuroscience employing EEG or MEG. However, the standard approach is to average {{a large number of}} trials for experimentally defined conditions in order to reduce intertrial-variability, i. e. treating it as a source of "noise". Yet it is now more and more accepted that trial-to-trial fluctuations bear functional significance, reflecting fluctuations of "brain states" that predispose perception and action. Such effects are often revealed in a pre-stimulus period, when comparing response variability to an invariant stimulus. However such offline analyses are disadvantageous as they are correlational by drawing conclusions in a posthoc-manner and stimulus presentation is random with respect to the feature of interest. A more direct test is to trigger stimulus presentation when the relevant feature is present. The current paper introduces ConSole (CONstance System for OnLine Eeg), a software package capable of analyzing ongoing EEG / MEG in real-time and presenting auditory and visual stimuli via internal routines. Stimulation via external devices (e. g. TMS) or third-party software (e. g. Psyscope X) is possible by sending TTL-triggers. With ConSole it is thus possible to target the stimulation at specific brain-states. In contrast to many available applications, ConSole is open-source. Its modular design enhances the power of the software as it can be easily adapted to new challenges and writing new experiments is an easy task. ConSole is already <b>pre-equipped</b> with modules performing standard signal processing steps. The software is also independent from the EEG / MEG system, as long as a driver can be written (currently 2 EEG systems are supported). Besides a general introduction, we present benchmark data regarding performance and validity of the calculations used, as well as three example applications of ConSole in different settings.

Hence, it {{is a great}} challenge to selectively cleave a particular C–H bond in the presence of multiple ones. One of most widely used approach to this problem is the use of -chelating directing groups (1). However, the insertion of the transition metal is strictly restricted to the ortho-C–H bond through a six- or seven-membered cyclic pre-transition state (TS). Although many strategies have been developed to selectively functionalize meta- and para-C–H bonds (2 – 4), this newly developed template approach overcomes the intrinsic steric and electronic bias of the substrates, and allows for the activation of remote C–H bonds. ### Introduction The most common bond in many organic compounds is the C–H bond.

On the same piece of weighing paper, weigh all the solids. Weigh the substrate (0. 10 mmol) first, followed by Pd(OPiv) 2 (3. 0 mg, 0. 010 mmol, 0. 10 equiv.) and AgOPiv (62. 7 mg, 0. 30 mmol, 3. 0 equiv.). The solids were carefully transferred into the bottom of a 15 mL pressure vessel equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirrer bar. - Add ethyl acrylate (16. 5 µL, 0. 15 mmol, 1. 5 equiv.) to the solid mixture. - Wash down the solids on the sides of wall with 1, 2 -dichloroethane (1. 0 mL). - Cap the tube and submerge it into a pre-heated 90 °C (controlled by a digital temperature probe) oil bath. - Cover the tube and oil bath with aluminum foil and leave the reaction stirring for a total of 42 – 48 hours. - Lift vessel out of the oil bath and submerge it into ice bath for 10 minutes. - Filter the reaction mixture through a short pad of Celite® into a scintillation vial and wash the tube and Celite® pad three times with 2 mL of diethyl ether. Evaporate the solvent to dryness using a rotary evaporator. - Purify the desired product by preparative silica gel thin-layer chromatography eluting with hexane:ethyl acetate to yield the desired olefinated product. **Hydrocinnamic acid derivatives** 1. On the same piece of weighing paper, weigh all the solids sequentially as followed: Pd(OAc) 2 (2. 3 mg, 0. 010 mmol, 10 mol%), Ac-Gly-OH (2. 4 mg, 0. 020 mmol, 20 mol%), AgOAc (50 mg, 0. 30 mmol, 3. 0 equiv.) and the substrate (0. 10 mmol). The solids were carefully transferred into the bottom of a 35 mL pressure vessel <b>pre-equipped</b> with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirrer bar. - HFIP (1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3 -Hexafluoro- 2 -propanol) (0. 60 mL) was added to the mixture to wash down the solids on the sides of wall, followed by ethyl acrylate (22 µL, 2. 0 equiv.) and then another 0. 60 mL of HFIP. - Cap the tube tightly and submerge it into a pre-heated 90 °C (controlled by a digital temperature probe) oil bath. - Leave the reaction stirring for 24 hours. - Lift vessel out of the oil bath and filtrate the reaction mixture through a short pad of Celite® into a 50 ml round bottom flask after it cools down. - Evaporate the solvent to dryness using a rotary evaporator. - Isolate the desired product by preparative silica gel thin-layer chromatography eluting with hexane:ethyl acetate to yield the desired olefinated product. ### Timing - Toluene derivatives: 42 hours (electron-donating substituents); 48 hours (electron-withdrawing substituents) - Hydrocinnamic acid derivatives: 24 hours ### Troubleshooting - Toluene derivatives - Poor separation of the major meta-isomer from the minor isomers: Preparative thin-layer chromatography is usually the first choice to achieve better separation. Repetitive running of the thin-layer chromatography using less polar eluent is recommended to achieve good resolution. - Hydrocinnamic acid derivatives - Problem: Poor separation of mono-olefinated meta-isomer from the di-olefinated meta-isomer (when applicable), and poor separation of the major meta-isomer from the trace minor isomers for some substrates. - Solutions: Especially for those substrates with di-olefinated product, preparative thin-layer chromatography is usually employed to achieve better separation. Repetitive developing of the thin-layer chromatography (3 to 5 times) using relative less polar eluent is recommended. ### Anticipated Results Typical isolated yield of toluene derivatives should be 46 – 98 % depending on the substituents on the aromatic ring and olefins used. Typical yield of hydrocinnamic acid derivatives should be 67 – 93 % depending on the substituents on the aromatic ring. Longer reaction time than 24 hours may lead to more di-olefinated products; however, shorter reaction time could cause incomplete reaction. ### References 1. Engle, K.
