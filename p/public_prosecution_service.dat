40|$|When {{a family}} is grieving {{the loss of a}} member the {{consideration}} of post mortem is an additional concern. This study set out to explore how relatives are supported to give authorisation and throughout the post mortem process. Thirteen relatives with varied experiences of a relative's death took part in interviews. Data analysis revealed the post mortem as part of the narrative of the death, with more significance for some than others. Important aspects for relatives were being able to say "goodbye" properly, and engagement with staff in hospital and procurator fiscal (<b>public</b> <b>prosecution)</b> <b>services</b> in more substantive communicative relationships, rather than only receiving basic information. Relatives valued receiving results they could understand. There may be opportunities, particularly in coroner or procurator fiscal services, for development of roles in liaison between relatives and pathology services, and support for relatives.

40|$|Tasked with {{enforcing}} {{the criminal law}} against suspected offenders, public prosecutors have traditionally enjoyed broad discretion, which is usually structured by legal and policy guidelines defining rules prosecutors should follow when making their decisions. Basing its analysis upon direct observations and interviews in the two jurisdictions under study, this comparative thesis endeavours {{to understand how the}} French and Anglo-Welsh criminal justice systems attempt to combine the necessities of accountability for <b>public</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>services</b> in modern democratic societies with the flexibility and reactivity needed in the application of the law provided by prosecutorial discretion. There have been few systematic, empirical accounts of the decision-making process of these national <b>prosecution</b> <b>services.</b> This thesis argues that neither system observed achieves a satisfactory balance between accountability and discretion for public prosecutors. In France, although democratic and hierarchical accountability channels are well developed in theory, oversight is weak due to the primacy of the concept of ‘adaptation’ in the legal culture and the strong professional ethos of procureurs as independent judicial officers. In England and Wales, public prosecutors are part of a highly bureaucratic and centralised structure which strictly enforces consistency in prosecutorial decisions at the expense of much discretion and autonomy for individual prosecutors whose responsibility is limited to narrow and repetitive tasks due to the segmentation of the prosecution process. This overbearing accountability structure, coupled with a historical balance of power in favour of the police, appears to prevent prosecutors from making decisions perceived as unpopular with their hierarchy or the police. Finally, pressure on resources and a drive for efficiency in both jurisdictions have resulted in the bureaucratisation of the criminal justice process with part of the prosecution workload being delegated to unqualified staff and minor cases being processed as quickly as possible into a one-size-fits-all system. ...|$|R

40|$|A Constituição Federal de 1988 buscou garantir e ampliar direitos sociais e estabeleceu mecanismos à sociedade brasileira para assegurá-los. Definiu a saúde como direito do cidadão e dever do Estado, possibilitando a participação social, por meio de conselhos gestores, na construção de políticas públicas. Por outro lado, ampliou as atribuições do Ministério Público e o incumbiu de defender o previsto em lei, fornecendo-lhe instrumentos para a defesa de direitos difusos e coletivos. Este estudo tem por objetivo identificar as possibilidades de interação entre estes dois agentes, um de controle social e outro institucional, na construção da defesa e garantia do direito à saúde. Utilizamo-nos de dados registrados em tabelas e gráficos, que documentam a realidade da Comarca de Maringá, e de análise de conteúdo de entrevistas semi-estruturadas com os atores escolhidos, quais sejam, os cinco Presidentes dos Conselhos Municipais de Saúde da Comarca, os respectivos Secretários Municipais de Saúde e a Promotora de Justiça. Os resultados desta pesquisa nos remetem a concluir que a interação estabelecida entre estes espaços se assenta em relações marcadas pela subordinação de um pelo outro. Prova disso é a prevalência de posturas de subserviência identificadas no espaço do conselho, que tem sido obstáculos no trato da coisa pública. Constatamos, ainda, que a forte ofensiva {{neoliberal}} contra projetos democratizantes, como, por exemplo, os princípios do Sistema Único de Saúde, vem encontrando resistências no interior do próprio Estado, através de ações do Ministério Público que buscam sintonia com o Estado de Direito. Defendemos que os atores sociais apropriem-se desses espaços democráticos, estabeleçam sólidas parcerias, e internalizem as constantes lutas pela garantia dos direitos sociais constitucionalmente assegurados. The Federal Constitution of 1988 seeked {{to guarantee}} and expand social rights and introduced ways to the Brazilian society to insure them. It defined health as a citizen?s {{right and a}} State's duty, enabling the social participation, through Management Councils, in building the public politics. On the other hand, it amplified the <b>Public</b> <b>Prosecution</b> <b>Service's</b> attributions and entrusted it to defend what was foreseen by the law, and provided it with instruments {{for the defense of}} diffuse and collective rights. This paper has as its goal to identify the possibilities of interaction between these two agents, one being the social control and the other institutional, in building the defense and guarantee to right to health. We have used qualitative data shown through tables and charts, to charactize the reality of Maringá?s Municipality, and through the analysis of contents of semi-structured interviews with chosen actors, these being the five Presidents of the Municipal Health Councils in the Municipality, the respective Municipal Secretaries of Health and the District Attorney. The results of this research make us conclude that the interaction established between them is based on their subordination to one another. The evidence of this is the prevalence of postures of subservience identified at the Council, which have been obstacles in the treatment of the public thing. We have also verified that the strong neoliberal offensive against democratizing projects, such as the principles of the Unified Health System (Sistema Único de Saúde, SUS), has been finding resistance within its own State through the <b>Public</b> <b>Prosecution</b> <b>Service's</b> actions which seek synchrony with the State of Rights. We defend that the social actors take over these democratic spaces, establish solid partnerships and internalize the constant fights for guarantee to social rights constitutionally insured...|$|R
