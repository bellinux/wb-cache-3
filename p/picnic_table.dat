5|$|The {{first state}} {{trunkline}} highway designated {{along the path}} of the modern US2 was M‑12, a designation that was in use by July 1, 1919, between Ironwood and Sault Ste. Marie. The first roadside park in the country was created by Herbert Larson near what is now US2 near Iron River in 1919–20, although other sources state that the first was a <b>picnic</b> <b>table</b> alongside US16 (Grand River Avenue) in 1929 south of Saranac. When the US Highway System was created on November 11, 1926, US2 partially replaced M-12. Between Crystal Falls and Iron Mountain, US2 was routed through Florence, Wisconsin. The former routing of M‑12 from Crystal Falls to Sagola became a new M‑69 when the former M‑69 became US102 (now US141). M‑12 from Sagola south to Iron Mountain was made a part of an extended M‑45, which is now M‑95. By the next year, M‑48 was added along US2 from Rexton to Garnet {{as part of a larger}} extension.|$|E

The state highway commissioner was required to sign the state trunkline highways, and Michigan become the second state after Wisconsin to do so.

Other sources say that the first roadside park in the country was created by Herbert Larson near what is now US2 near Iron River in 1919–20. The first crows nest traffic tower in the US was installed at the intersection of Woodward and Michigan avenues in Detroit on October 9, 1917.
