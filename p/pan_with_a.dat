Though most {{are not meant}} to be dedicated military satellites, some have a spatial resolution of 1 metre or below which can be also used for military applications. Noteworthy satellites include the Technology Experiment Satellite (TES) which has a panchromatic camera (<b>PAN)</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> resolution of 1-metre, the RISAT-2 which is capable of imaging in all-weather conditions and has a resolution of one metre, the CARTOSAT-2, CARTOSAT-2A and CARTOSAT-2B which carries a panchromatic camera which has a resolution of 80 centimetres (black and white only).|$|E
25|$|Jack accidentally knocks {{himself out}} by {{shooting}} {{a piece of}} the ceiling that falls on his head, and promptly is trapped under a suit of armor when he comes to. Wang kills Rain in a sword duel, while Jack and Gracie chase the newly-alive Lo Pan. Wang joins them, and just when all seems lost, Jack kills Lo <b>Pan</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> skillful knife throw. Thunder - who had been distracted with Wang - reappears, and, furious at finding Lo Pan dead, explodes. Jack, Wang, Gracie, and Miao Yin are cornered by Lightning in a corridor, who triggers a collapse with his powers. Egg rescues them with a rope and kills Lightning by dropping a stone Buddha statue on him when he tries to follow. After finding Jack's truck and dealing the remaining Wing Kong guards, the group busts out and escapes back to Wang's restaurant.|$|E
25|$|To make hollandaise sauce, {{the eggs}} yolks are {{separated}} {{and added to}} a butter base with small amounts of water, vinegar or lemon juice with pepper, heated together slowly over a double boiler. A stainless steel bowl over a sauce <b>pan</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> small amount of water may also be used. The water should not touch the bowl or boil, just simmer. The key to the recipe is to heat the ingredients without curdling the egg. Add the egg and liquid ingredients first and whisk together with a wire whisk until frothy. Add the egg and liquid froth to the double boiler of the simmering water and whisk quickly and continuously. The mixture will expand a few times. Remove from the heat source and begin adding warm, melted, clarified butter to the mixture. If the sauce cools too much the butter will begin to thicken. If this or separation begins to occur, {{a few drops of}} hot water can solve this issue.|$|E

2500|$|Pit latrines are {{sometimes}} {{also referred to}} as [...] "dry toilets" [...] but this is not recommended because a [...] "dry toilet" [...] is an overarching term used for several types of toilets and strictly speaking only refers to the user interface. Depending on the region, the term [...] "pit latrine" [...] may be used to denote a toilet that has a squatting <b>pan</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> water seal or siphon (more accurately termed a pour-flush pit latrine – very common in South East Asia for example) or simply {{a hole in the ground}} without a water seal (also called a simple pit latrine) – the common type in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Whilst a dry toilet can be with or without urine diversion, a pit latrine is almost always without urine diversion. The key characteristic of a pit latrine is the use of a pit, which infiltrates liquids into the ground and acts as a device for storage and very limited treatment.|$|E

He said, 'Now, you have to learn how to kill these things, boys: you bite 'em right behind the eye.' And with that, he chomped down! The octopus has some sort of spinal cord there, and biting it there does kill it! Then we had to go back to the beach where Butch would put these things in a frying <b>pan</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> little oil and some salt and stir them around.
