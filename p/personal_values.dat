These formed the foundation for Brazilian democratic ideals. Historians have also largely agreed that PedroII's reign was not merely benign, but rather, exceptionally constructive and progressive.

5|$|In {{the wake}} of his {{personal}} loss, Morris, known for his sincerity and high <b>personal</b> <b>values,</b> received many offers of work and financial assistance. With a reference from English cricketer Doug Insole, Morris joined British engineering company George Wimpey for a few years. He then moved back to Sydney to take up a public relations job with security group Wormald International where he worked until his retirement in the late 1980s. He was appointed to the Sydney Cricket Ground Trust in 1965 and served there for 22 years, eight of them as deputy chairman. During this time, the ground was modernised and the Bradman Stand erected. In 1968, Morris met and married his second wife Judith Menmuir. He was awarded the MBE in 1974 for services to sport. In late 1989, Morris and his wife retired to the town of Cessnock in the Hunter Region, north of Sydney. He continued to play tennis into his late seventies and enjoyed watching Test cricket although he refused to watch one-day cricket, introduced after his playing days, due to his preference for tradition.|$|E

25|$|Metaphysical naturalists do {{not believe}} in a soul or spirit, nor in ghosts, and when {{explaining}} what constitutes the mind they rarely appeal to substance dualism. If one's mind, or rather one's identity and existence as a person, is entirely the product of natural processes, three conclusions follow according to W.T. Stace. First, all mental contents (such as ideas, theories, emotions, moral and <b>personal</b> <b>values,</b> or aesthetic response) exist solely as computational constructions of one's brain and genetics, not as things that exist independently of these. Second, damage to the brain (regardless of how) should be of great concern. Third, death or destruction of one's brain cannot be survived, which is to say, all humans are mortal. Stace, however, believes that ecstatic mysticism calls into question the assumption that awareness is impossible without data processing.|$|E

500|$|Towards her [...] "weak perfectionist" [...] liberalism, Levinson {{requires}} three {{traits of}} a liberal society: (1) an agreeable, transparent, and equally accessible [...] "legitimation process" [...] for government, (2) pluralism, and (3) [...] "substantive liberal institutions" [...] such as [...] "individual liberties and ... governmental duties". She pairs this view of liberalism with thick autonomy as [...] "the only defensible interpretation of liberalism". Levinson develops an idea of autonomy that would be agreeable to most citizens while sufficient to guarantee liberalism's [...] "substantive liberal institutions", and defines it as [...] "higher-order preference formation" [...] that minds one's <b>personal</b> <b>values</b> while allowing for openness to criticism and a developed personality. She argues that capacity for autonomy is a right to children, {{that the state is}} obligated to facilitate it, and that children are obligated to receive it. In this way, Levinson's stance is that the state must make education compulsory. Children require paternalistic decisions of some sort, and the state is best suited to promote consent and operate {{in the best interests of}} children. The state has a right to override lack of child and parental interest in such an autonomy-promoting education, since such an override lets children decide their values later in life, as adults, as opposed to never having that opportunity. Levinson contends that parents, on the other hand, must provide for the well-being, identity development, and [...] "cultural coherence" [...] sense of their children.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityThe {{purpose of}} the present {{experiment}} was to study the relationship between motivation and perception, specifically between visual recognition thresholds of words related to specific areas of <b>personal</b> <b>value.</b> The context of this experiment is provided by those studies in perception which found the evidence for a relationship between positive motivational states of the perceiver such as reward states, needs, etc., and the speed with which the perceiver recognizes motivationally congruent stimuli. Of these studies, those utilizing <b>personal</b> <b>value</b> as the motivational factor have engendered much theoretical and methodological criticism. One such critique proposed to explain the obtained relationship between high <b>personal</b> <b>value</b> and low tachistoscopic visual recognition thresholds for relevant high value words {{on the basis of the}} perceiver's familiarity with the stimulus words used. In that experiment it was demonstrated that the value factor was insignificant when common words, as measured by word counts of samples of popular literature, were used. [TRUNCATED...|$|R

Some theorists, such as David Keirsey, have expanded on the MBTI descriptions, providing even greater detail. For instance, Keirsey's descriptions of his four temperaments, which he correlated with the sixteen MBTI personality types, show how the temperaments differ in terms of language use, intellectual orientation, educational and vocational interests, social orientation, self-image, <b>personal</b> <b>values,</b> social roles, and characteristic hand gestures.|$|E
2500|$|Swinging {{is a form}} of extradyadic sex where {{married couples}} {{exchange}} partners with each other. Swinging was originally called [...] "wife-swapping" [...] but due to the sexist connotations and the fact that many wives were willing to swap partners, [...] "mate swapping" [...] and or [...] "swinging" [...] was substituted (Hyde, DeLamater, & Byers, 2009).

Swinging can be closed or open, where couples meet and each pair goes off to a separate room or they have sex in the same room (Hyde, DeLamater, & Byers, 2009). The majority of swingers fall into the middle and upper classes, with an above average education and income, and majority of these swingers are White (90%) (Jenks, 1998).
