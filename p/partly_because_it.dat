5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{development}} of the linen industry, Ireland was largely passed over by the industrial revolution, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> lacked coal and iron resources and partly because {{of the impact of the}} sudden union with the structurally superior economy of England, which saw Ireland as a source of agricultural produce and capital.|$|E
5|$|Although the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System began pumping oil in 1977, it did {{not have}} a major {{immediate}} impact on global oil prices. This is <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> took several years to reach full production and partly because U.S. production outside Alaska declined until the mid-1980s. The Iranian Revolution and OPEC price increases triggered the 1979 energy crisis despite TAPS production increases. Oil prices remained high until the late 1980s, when a stable international situation, the removal of price controls, and the peak of production at Prudhoe Bay contributed to the 1980s oil glut. In 1988, TAPS was delivering 25 percent of all U.S. oil production. As North Slope oil production declined, so did TAPS' share of U.S. production. Today, TAPS provides less than 17 percent of U.S. oil production.|$|E
5|$|Until 1912, {{the strip}} (uniform) of the French team was white with two rings, one red and one blue. After {{the first game}} won by France against Scotland in 1911, France's captain Marcel Communeau asked that the team adopt the coq gaulois (Gallic rooster), {{historical}} emblem of France, as its symbol. The Gallic rooster was probably chosen <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is considered as a proud and combative animal that can be sometimes aggressive, although it had been used previously as a symbol by French teams – a former soccer player, Jean Rigal, wore a uniform with this emblem as early as May 1910. The badge was initially white and red, but was altered to a multicoloured, embroidered image after 1945, and has been golden since 1970.|$|E
5000|$|Digital Spy {{gave the}} song 4/5 stars and a {{positive}} review stating: 'Stone Cold Sober' makes the most of her theatrical background. Sure, it's another slice of post-Winehouse retro-pop, but it's more interesting that most tunes of that ilk, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>it's</b> a got a chorus you could quite easily do the can-can to, and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> Faith gives <b>it</b> more sass than a backchatting teenager. Maybe a spell in the circus should be compulsory for all pop wannabes? ...|$|R
5000|$|The Guardian {{said that}} [...] "there's {{a lot going}} on in the recent single Extraordinary - steel drums, pizzicato strings, {{rumbling}} timpani, cut-up vocal samples, chattering electronics - but you'd never notice, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> the production is so polite and anaemic that it saps the constant musical shifts of their power, and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>it's</b> all buried underneath another rotten song, this time a kind of uplifting Emile Sandé-esque ballad: the result is about as extraordinary as branch of Tesco Express".|$|R
25|$|French {{authors and}} historians often {{compared}} Latouche-Tréville to Nelson, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> he fought and defeated {{him in the}} Raids on Boulogne, <b>partly</b> <b>because,</b> had <b>it</b> not been for his untimely death, he would have opposed Nelson at Trafalgar.|$|R
5|$|Carol Vernallis, {{author of}} Experiencing Music Video, found homoerotic connotations between Madonna and the mermen. The mermen {{in the video}} exist in a {{self-contained}} world of their own, where they procreate with their own kind, both biologically and socially. The fact that the mermen {{did not seem to}} possess genitalia led Vernallis to believe that the video associated them with other works by Ritts – namely homoerotic sculptural images without penises. Their tails drew different meanings, including sexual ones and Christian symbolism. Since in contemporary art, images of mermen are rare while mermaids are common, they are sometimes called fairies <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is not known how they came to be. Vernallis believed that the mysteriousness and the elusiveness of the mermen in the video played a crucial role. They never address the camera directly and are often shown disappearing from view. Vernallis believed that since invisibility was a central theme in the homosexual community, this actually portrayed oppression and the desire to watch but never be seen.|$|E
5|$|Common {{blackbirds}} {{spend much}} of their time looking for food on the ground where they can become infested with ticks, which are external parasites that most commonly attach to the head of a blackbird. In France, 74% of rural blackbirds were found to be infested with Ixodes ticks, whereas, only 2% of blackbirds living in urban habitats were infested. This is <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is more difficult for ticks to find another host on lawns and gardens in urban areas than in uncultivated rural areas, and partly because ticks are likely to be commoner in rural areas, where a variety of tick hosts, such as foxes, deer and boar, are more numerous. Although ixodid ticks can transmit pathogenic viruses and bacteria, and are known to transmit Borrelia bacteria to birds, {{there is no evidence that}} this affects the fitness of blackbirds except when they are exhausted and run down after migration.|$|E
5|$|Franklin Pierce won {{the presidential}} election, and in 1853 made Davis his Secretary of War. In this capacity, Davis began the Pacific Railroad Surveys {{in order to}} {{determine}} various possible routes for the proposed Transcontinental Railroad. He promoted the Gadsden Purchase of today's southern Arizona from Mexico, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> would provide an easier southern route for the new railroad; the Pierce administration agreed, and the land was purchased in December 1853. He saw the size of the regular army as insufficient to fulfill its mission, and maintained that salaries would have to be increased, something which had not occurred for 25 years. Congress agreed and increased the pay scale, and added four regiments which increased the army's size from about 11,000 to about 15,000. Davis also introduced general usage of the rifles that he had used successfully during the Mexican–American War. As a result, both the morale and capability of the army was improved. He became involved in public works when Pierce gave him responsibility for construction of the Washington Aqueduct and an expansion of the U.S. Capitol, both of which he managed closely. The Pierce administration ended in 1857 after Pierce's loss of the Democratic nomination to James Buchanan. Davis's term was to end with Pierce's, so he ran for the Senate, was elected, and re-entered it on March 4, 1857.|$|E
25|$|In 2012 the CCME {{started the}} Air Quality Management System process. This {{provided}} {{for evaluation of}} PM and ozone measurements at many sites in BC and across Canada. In 2015 the first air zone reports for BC were published. They show that Crofton, Smithers and Vanderhoof are not meeting the PM2.5 standard. This is a trigger for corrective intervention. The exact type of intervention is not yet determined, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>it's</b> a new process and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of variable site-specific factors.

50|$|In 2015, Sissay {{became the}} Patron of All Fm 96.9 Community Radio in Manchester (www.allfm.org). He said: “I’ve always loved All Fm, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>it’s</b> such diverse radio (with shows in Urdu, Polish, Somali, Persian, Cantonese and more), but also <b>because</b> <b>it</b> played ‘Architecture,’ (Bertallot & Mo-Dus Remix) which I’d lost and the All Fm DJ {{sent me a}} copy.” Lemn’s poems are read {{frequently}} on All Fm and one of it’s older presenters, Li, aged 84, translated and read his poem ‘Invisible Kisses’ in Mandarin and English.

5000|$|Manohla Dargis of The New York Times {{called the}} film [...] "somewhat sickening, mildly gonzo" [...] and added, [...] "Crazy Love takes a mildly hyperventilated {{approach}} to its subject; there’s {{a hint of}} tabloid sensationalism, a splash of kitsch sentimentalism. It moves fast, if predictably so, with the usual mash-up of talking-head testimonials, faded family photographs, blurred home movies and generic stock footage meant to evoke specific times and places. An opening quotation from Jacques Lacan makes you think you’re headed for deep waters, when all that’s in store is a frolic in the shallows. The overall vibe is morbidly entertaining, though something of a downer, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>it’s</b> unclear if Mr. and Mrs. Pugach {{know that they are}} such sick puppies, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>it’s</b> unclear if Mr. Klores cares that they are ... It belongs to that class of documentaries that might be called the family freak show. But it also belongs to the more familiar category of the misery documentary, those nonfiction works that poke into the ghastliness of other people’s lives like a finger rummaging inside a wound ... it also raises more questions than it answers, including the moral responsibility a documentary filmmaker assumes when his subjects seem so eager to exploit themselves." ...|$|R
5|$|Pound's {{editorial}} {{choices were}} {{based on what he}} saw as the degree of sympathy that these writers displayed with Imagist precepts, rather than active participation in a group as such. Williams, who was based in the United States, had not participated in any of the discussions of the Eiffel Tower group. However, he and Pound had long been corresponding {{on the question of the}} renewal of poetry along similar lines. Ford was included at least partly because of his strong influence on Pound, as the younger poet made the transition from his earlier, Pre-Raphaelite-influenced style towards a harder, more modern way of writing. The inclusion of a poem by Joyce, I Hear an Army, which was sent to Pound by W.B. Yeats, took on a wider importance in the history of literary modernism, as the subsequent correspondence between the two led to the serial publication, at Pound's behest, of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man in The Egoist. Joyce's poem is not written in free verse, but in rhyming quatrains. However, it strongly reflects Pound's interest in poems written to be sung to music, such as those by the troubadours and Guido Cavalcanti. The book met with little popular or critical success, at least <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> had no introduction or commentary to explain what the poets were attempting to do, and a number of copies were returned to the publisher.|$|E
5|$|The Tribal Hidage {{has been}} of great {{importance}} to historians {{since the middle of}} the 19th century, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> mentions territories unrecorded in other documents. Attempts to link all the names in the list with modern places are highly speculative and all resulting maps are treated with caution. Three different versions (or recensions) of the Tribal Hidage have survived, two of which resemble each other: one dates from the 11th century and is part of a miscellany of works; another is contained in a 17th-century Latin treatise; the third version, which has survived in six mediaeval manuscripts, has many omissions and spelling variations. All three versions appear {{to be based on the}} same lost manuscript: historians have been unable to establish a date for the original compilation. The Tribal Hidage has been used to construct theories about the political organisation of the Anglo-Saxons, and to give an insight into the Mercian state and its neighbours at a time when Mercia held hegemony over a number of other peoples. It has been used to support theories regarding the origin and location of the tribes in the list and the way in which the tribes were systematically assessed and ruled by others. Some historians have proposed that the Tribal Hidage is not a list of peoples but of administrative areas.|$|E

50|$|The Automatic Tide Marker Station {{achieved}} its objectives. However, Irvine harbour's fortunes still declined, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of <b>it</b> being a {{tidal harbour}} and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of intense rivalry from other local ports.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the Evolutionary programming (EP) method for optimizing PID parameters. PID {{is the most}} common type of regulator within control theory, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>it's</b> relatively simple and yields stable results for most applications. The p, i and d parameters vary for each application; therefore, choosing the right parameters is crucial for obtaining good results but also somewhat difficult. EP is a derivative-free optimization algorithm which makes it suitable for PID optimization. The experiments in this paper demonstrate the power of EP to solve the problem of optimizing PID parameters without getting stuck in local minimums...|$|R
5000|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Emma Tomelty and filmed in March 2012 at the Sydney Technology Park in Sydney, New South Wales. A behind-the-scenes video of the shoot was posted online on 22 March 2012. A preview of the official video clip was shown on Sunrise on 2 April 2012, and the full video premiered online later that day. Ninemsn's MusicFix commented that the video [...] "is certainly eye-catching, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>it's</b> packed with fluoro-bright colours and perfectly-timed dance routines, {{but also because the}} Aussie pop darling has no pants on".

25|$|The {{action of}} one single dose is much longer (6 to 8 hr) than the very short {{half-life}} {{of the drug}} indicates. This could be <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> persists for over 11 hours in synovial fluids.|$|E
25|$|Mexico is {{estimated}} {{to have at least}} 28,000 snake envenomings annually, although {{only a small number of}} these lead to death. Central America is home to 23 species of pit vipers, and they inflict the vast majority of reported bites. Of these, Bothrops asper is the most important species, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is abundant in lowland areas and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is frequently found in agricultural and pastoral areas where humans work. Of the elapids, the yellow-bellied sea snake has, very rarely, caused venomous bites, while the coral snakes, although common, inflict only 1 to 2% of all reported snake bites. Of the coral snakes, Micrurus nigrocinctus is responsible for the most bites.|$|E
25|$|In December, she {{released}} her Cantonese album Di-Dar which mixes an alternative yodelling style {{with a touch}} of Indian and Middle Eastern flavour.

5000|$|The band, much to {{the dismay}} of the management, decides to ditch the name [...] "FIST", and starts {{wondering}} about another one.

25|$|Another {{limitation}} of the social research is that nearly all of it has concerned girls, partly because female puberty requires greater physiologic resources and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> involves a unique event (menarche) that makes survey research into female puberty much simpler than male.

2500|$|Critic Stephanie Zacharek of Salon {{states that}} [...] "this {{adaptation}} of Cormac McCarthy's novel touches on brutal themes, but never really gets its hands dirty. The movie's violence isn't pulpy and visceral, {{the kind of}} thing that hits like a fist; it's brutal, and rather relentless, but there are still several layers of comfortable distance between it and us. At one point a character lifts his cowboy boot, daintily, so it won't be mussed by the pool of blood gathering at his feet ... The Coens have often used cruel violence to make their points– that's nothing new– but putting that violence to work in the service of allegedly deep themes isn't the same as actually getting your hands dirty. No Country for Old Men feels less like a breathing, thinking movie than an exercise. That may be <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>it's</b> an adaptation of a book by a contemporary author who's usually spoken of in hushed, respectful, hat-in-hand tones, as if he were a schoolmarm who'd finally brought some sense and order to a lawless town." ...|$|R
