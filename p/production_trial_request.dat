40|$|Two <b>production</b> <b>trials</b> were {{conducted}} for 84 d each. The first with 22 Holstein cows in late lactation. The second with 46 Holstein cows in early lactation. Treatments were C (control) and AO (A. oryzae 3 g/d). Diets were for <b>production</b> <b>trial</b> 1 a 1 : 1 forage: concentrate ratio; for trial 2 was 2 : 3. Milk <b>production</b> in <b>trial</b> 1 was higher (P >. 05) in AO fed cows {{during the first}} weeks of the trial. In trial two AO cows consistently produced more milk (P. 10). Two digestibility <b>trials</b> followed the <b>production</b> <b>trials.</b> For all digestion trials, Cr₂O₃ was used as digesta marker. In trial one AO tended to increase digestibility of DM (P >. 10). In trial two digestibilities of DM, NDF and ADF were higher in AO fed cows (P. 10) in rumen pH, concentrations and proportions of VFA, and ammonia concentrations resulted from AO treatments. In the second trial C, AO and SC (Saccharomyces cerevesiae 3 g/d) were compared in a repeated 3 x 3 latin square design. A 1 : 2 forage to concentrate diet was fed to six lactating cows. Both AO and SC increased (P <. 05) rumen NDF digestibility. The third trial compared C vs AO in a swithchback design with four lactating cows fed a 2 : 3 forage to concentrate diet. AO increased (P <. 05) rumen fiber digestion. AO did not affect rates of passage of corn or alfalfa hay; or the potentially digestible DM of milo, alfalfa hay or wheat straw. AO did increase (P <. 05) digestion rate of alfalfa DM. In vitro AO increased DM digestibility. That effect can be reproduced by incorporation of the additive {{at the time of}} inoculation...|$|R

The <b>production</b> <b>trials</b> yields are summarized and a summary of annual income per hectare from rice and fish have been given.

40|$|Supplementation {{of dairy}} rations with steroidal sapogenins was {{evaluated}} in an in vitro, an in situ, and a <b>production</b> <b>trial.</b> Sixteen in vitro semicontinuous tureen cultures were supplied a 55 : 45 concentrate to roughage substrate with Sarsaponin concentrations of 0, 33, 55, and 77 ppm of air-dry feed for 22 d. Supplementation decreased protozoa numbers and increased bacterial numbers and acid detergent fiber digestion. Digestion of feed nitrogen {{tended to be}} lowest at the highest con-centration of Sarsaponin, whereas micro-bial nitrogen output was similar for all concentrations. In rumen-cannulated animals fed a typical dairy ration, in situ rate of disappearance of organic matter, acid detergent fiber, and nitrogen of a complete ration substrate tended to be lower with 77 ppm added Sarsaponin. In a <b>production</b> <b>trial,</b> 16 primiparous dairy cows 6 to 10 wk postpartum were fed rations containing either 0 or 77 ppm Sarsaponin.

30|$|While the ISPOR {{recommendations}} [6] remain relevant, the Process Subcommittee {{determined that}} the recommendations do not provide the level of detail required by end users to ensure consistency in the LV process when different translation companies are commissioned to translate PRO measures. Additionally, {{it is important to}} ensure that best practice guidelines are updated periodically to reflect any methodological advances and changes in regulatory requirements since their development. The ISPOR recommendations had been in use for a decade when the PRO Consortium’s consensus process began, and they were based on literature and experience dating back 10  years or more prior to publication. Recent feedback from representatives from clinical trial sponsors and translation companies confirms that current LV methodologies continue to differ across companies. The ISPOR recommendations were intentionally not prescriptive with regard to how the steps were performed, and as a result, member firms interested in using PRO Consortium measures in their <b>trials</b> <b>requested</b> further guidance regarding the appropriate LV process for these measures. As such, this consensus process was also driven by the need to meet increasing clinical <b>trial</b> <b>requests.</b> With the goal of ensuring consistency in the implementation of PRO Consortium-developed measures in global clinical trials and in the methods and evidence used to support their LV, the Process Subcommittee determined it would be necessary to develop a detailed LV process that reflects current best practice based on the ISPOR recommendations with adequate detail to ensure that a standardized LV methodology is used for all PRO Consortium measures.|$|R

40|$|The newest EN 1563 {{standard}} about {{ductile iron}} castings {{was published in}} 2011. The standard contains three new solid solution strengthened ferritic ductile iron grades: 450 – 18, 500 – 14 and 600 – 10. There are some studies for laboratory scale SSF samples, but very few studies about actual full scale SSF ductile iron production. The objective of this thesis was to gain more insight about the specifics of SSF ductile iron production. The theory portion of this thesis consists of a literature survey that focuses on cast iron metallurgy, ductile iron melt processes and cooling curve analysis of cast irons. The experimental part of this thesis consists of two <b>production</b> <b>trials</b> of 600 – 10 ductile iron and several linked cooling curve analyses and solidification simulations. The <b>production</b> <b>trials</b> were not completely successful. Different separately cast tensile test bars showed properties above and below standard requirements. Cooling curve samples taken during the trials showed that more potent nodulant and inoculant materials might be needed for production of 600 – 100 SSF ductile iron grades. The solidification simulations showed that the software does not fully understand {{the properties of the}} SSF grades, but it still is a useful tool for ductile iron design...|$|R
