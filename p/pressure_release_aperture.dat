40|$|Airway <b>pressure</b> <b>release</b> ventilation(APRV) is a {{relatively}} new mode of ventilation, that only became commercially available in the United States in the mid- 1990 s. Airway <b>pressure</b> <b>release</b> ventilation produces tidal ventilation using a method that differs from any other mode. It uses a <b>release</b> of airway <b>pressure</b> from an elevated baseline to simulate expiration. The elevated baseline facilitates oxygenation, and the timed releases aid in carbon dioxide removal. Advantages of APRV include lower airway pressures, lower minute ventilation, minimal adverse effects on cardio-circulatory function, ability to spontaneously breathe throughout the entire ventilatory cycle, decreased sedation use, and near elimination of neuromuscular blockade. Airway <b>pressure</b> <b>release</b> ventilation is consistent with lung protection strategies that strive to limit lung injury associated with mechanical ventilation. Future research will probably support the use of APRV as the primary mode of choice for patients with acute lung injury.

30|$|This paper {{improves}} our mechanistic {{understanding of}} lung protection using a ventilation strategy combining APRV, when {{used as an}} open-valve CPAP with a brief <b>pressure</b> <b>release.</b> If the <b>pressure</b> <b>release</b> phase is sufficiently brief, alveoli will be stabilized by two mechanisms: pressure and time. If the brief <b>pressure</b> <b>release</b> is set to less than the fastest alveolar collapse time constant, the alveolus {{does not have enough}} time to derecruit, and a time-controlled alveolar stability is generated. In addition, since the lung does not have time to fully collapse, an end-expiratory pressure is maintained generating a time-controlled PEEP. Some authors have suggested that auto-PEEP, {{or in the case of}} this study a time-controlled PEEP, is inferior to set PEEP because of heterogeneous alveolar collapse time constants causing the slow time constant alveoli to over-distend and the fast time constant alveoli to collapse. However, this hypothesis is based on theoretical, nonbiologic studies, using a single compartment model with a test lung [32, 33].|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{presence}} of a hydrostatic pressure as a general feature of SPD methods is essential for achieving the high strains {{and the introduction of}} the high amount of lattice defects, which are necessary to establish new grain boundaries. Systematic investigations of High Pressure Torsion (HPT) -deformed Cu under variation of strain and hydrostatic pressure revealed marked differences between the in-situ torsional stress (torque measurement) and the post-HPT strength of the ultrafine-grained materials. These facts let assume the occurrence of relaxation processes (recovery/recrystallisation) of static character with respect to the release of the hydrostatic pressure after straining. In order to gain insight into the processes behind, a special experimental procedure was designed to simulate the hydrostatic <b>pressure</b> <b>release.</b> Investigations by X-ray line profile analysis and hardness measurement show marked influences of the <b>pressure</b> <b>release</b> on microstructure and strength. While the size of the coherently scattering domains is not strongly affected, the dislocation density decreases drastically and the arrangement of the dislocations within the subgrain structure changes to a less stress intensive one, upon the <b>pressure</b> <b>release.</b> In parallel the hardness decreases significantly and confirms the discrepancy between in-situ torque-stress and post-HPT strength...|$|R

The authors developed a custom made <b>pressure</b> <b>release</b> valve {{to be added to}} portable insufflation devices, delivering air at pressures accepted as safe for effective reduction of intussusception in children under fluoroscopic guidance. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a custom made <b>pressure</b> <b>release</b> valve that is suitable for the insufflation devices used for air enema reduction of intussusception and to put this valve into regular clinical practice. Materials and Methods: An adjustable, custom made <b>pressure</b> <b>release</b> valve was assembled by the authors using readily available components. The valve was coupled to a simple air enema insufflation device. The device was used for the trial of reduction of intussusception in a prospective study that included 132 patients. Results: The success rate for air enema reduction with the new device was 88. 2 %. The mean pressure required to achieve complete reduction was 100 mmHg. The insufflation pressure never exceeded the preset value (120 mmHg). Of the successful cases, 58. 3 % were reduced from the first attempt while 36. 1 % required a second insufflation. Only 5. 55 % required a third insufflation to complete the reduction. In cases with unsuccessful pneumatic reduction attempt (18. 1 %), surgical treatment was required. Surgery ranged from simple reduction to resection with a primary end to end anastomosis. No complications from air enema were recorded.
