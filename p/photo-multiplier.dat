5000|$|The KamLAND detector's {{outer layer}} {{consists}} of an 18 meter-diameter stainless steel containment vessel with an inner lining of 1,879 <b>photo-multiplier</b> tubes (1325 17" [...] and 554 20" [...] PMTs). [...] Photocathode coverage is 34%. Its second, inner layer consists of a -diameter nylon balloon filled with a liquid scintillator composed of 1,000 metric tons of mineral oil, benzene, and fluorescent chemicals. Non-scintillating, highly purified oil provides buoyancy for the balloon and acts as a buffer to keep the balloon away from the <b>photo-multiplier</b> tubes; the oil also shields against external radiation. A 3.2 kiloton cylindrical water Cherenkov detector surrounds the containment vessel, acting as a muon veto counter and providing shielding from cosmic rays and radioactivity from the surrounding rock.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} VISARs {{were built}} at the National Laboratories and had free-space beams on optical tables with discrete optical components such as beam-splitting pellicles, mirrors, quarter wave delay plates, glass etalons, high voltage <b>photo-multiplier</b> tubes, Argon ion lasers and so on. They required {{a fair amount of}} expertise to maintain.|$|E
50|$|As {{a further}} {{characteristic}} of the GDD, a gaseous scintillation avalanche also accompanies the electron avalanche and, by detection of the light produced with a <b>photo-multiplier,</b> corresponding SE images can be routinely made. The frequency response of this mode has allowed the use of true TV scanning rates. This mode of the detector has been employed by a latest generation of commercial instruments.|$|E
50|$|The Modular Neutron Array {{consists}} of 144 individual detector modules. Each module {{is based on}} a plastic scintillator measuring 10 cm by 10 cm by 200 cm. This scintillator bar is fitted with light guides on each end that direct the light into one <b>photo-multiplier</b> tube on each end. Each detector module is wrapped in a light-tight material, allowing the detector array to be arranged in different configurations.|$|E
5000|$|A {{laser beam}} {{passes through the}} {{electrophoresis}} cell, irradiates the particles dispersed in it, and is scattered by the particles. The scattered light is detected by a <b>photo-multiplier</b> after passing through two pinholes. There {{are two types of}} optical systems: heterodyne and fringe.Ware and Flygare [...] developed a heterodyne-type ELS instrument, that was the first instrument of this type. In a fringe optics ELS instrument, a laser beam is divided into two beams. Those cross inside the electrophresis cell at a fixed angle to produce a fringe pattern. The scattered light from the particles, which migrates inside the fringe, is amplitude-modulated. The frequency shifts from both types of optics obey the same equations. The observed spectra resemble each other.Oka et al. developed an ELS instrument of heterodyne-type optics that is now available commercially. Its optics is shown in Fig. 3.|$|E
50|$|Time-correlated single-photon {{counting}} (TCSPC) {{is usually}} employed because it compensates for variations in source intensity and single photon pulse amplitudes. Using commercial TCSPC equipment a fluorescence decay curve can be recorded {{with a time}} resolution down to 405 fs.The recorded fluorescence decay histogram obeys Poisson statistics which is considered in determining goodness of fit during fitting. More specifically, TCSPC records times at which individual photons are detected by a fast single-photon detector (typically a <b>photo-multiplier</b> tube (PMT) or a single photon avalanche photo diode (SPAD)) {{with respect to the}} excitation laser pulse. The recordings are repeated for multiple laser pulses and after enough recorded events, one is able to build a histogram of the number of events across all of these recorded time points. This histogram can then be fit to an exponential function that contains the exponential lifetime decay function of interest, and the lifetime parameter can accordingly be extracted. Multi-channel PMT systems with 16 to 64 elements have been commercially available, whereas the recently demonstrated CMOS single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD)-TCSPC FLIM systems can offer even higher number of detection channels and additional low-cost options.|$|E
50|$|The {{detector}} is a high-purity liquid scintillator calorimeter. It {{is placed}} within {{a stainless steel}} sphere which holds the signal detectors (<b>photo-multiplier</b> tubes or PMTs) and is shielded by a water tank to protect it against external radiation and tag incoming cosmic muons that manage to penetrate the overburden of the mountain above. The primary aim of the experiment {{is to make a}} precise measurement of the individual neutrino fluxes from the Sun and compare them to the Standard solar model predictions. This will allow scientists to test and to further understand the functioning of the Sun (e.g., nuclear fusion processes taking place {{at the core of the}} Sun, solar composition, opacities, matter distribution, etc.) and will also help determine properties of neutrino oscillations, including the MSW effect. Specific goals of the experiment are to detect beryllium-7, boron-8, pp, pep and CNO solar neutrinos as well as anti-neutrinos from the Earth and nuclear power plants. The project may also be able to detect neutrinos from supernovae within our galaxy with a special potential to detect the elastic scattering of neutrinos onto protons, due to neutral current interactions. Searches for rare processes and potential unknown particles are also underway. The SOX project will study the possible existence of sterile neutrinos or other anomalous effects in neutrino oscillations at short ranges. Borexino is a member of the Supernova Early Warning System.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} a neural network-based method aimed at automatically calibrating the detector module {{contained in a}} scanner for a highresolution positron emission tomography (PET) system for small animals. The detector module is composed of crystal elements, arranged in a regular matrix and sensitive to gamma rays emitted by a radioactive source. The crystal matrix is optically coupled to a position-sensitive <b>photo-multiplier</b> tube, which reconstructs the original image. Calibration, required to cope with spatial distortions introduced by the optical system, consists of a segmentation process of the image produced after the <b>photo-multiplier</b> tube into a fixed number of areas.

40|$|Systems that adopt organic {{scintillation}} detector arrays often require a calibration process {{prior to the}} intended measurement campaign to correct for significant performance variances between detectors within the array. These differences exist because of low tolerances associated with <b>photo-multiplier</b> tube technology and environmental influences. Differences in detector response can be corrected for by adjusting the supplied <b>photo-multiplier</b> tube voltage to control its gain and the effect that this has on the pulse height spectra from a gamma-only calibration source with a defined photo-peak. Automated methods that analyze these spectra and adjust the <b>photo-multiplier</b> tube bias accordingly are emerging for hardware that integrate acquisition electronics and high voltage control. However, development of such algorithms require access to the hardware, multiple detectors and calibration source for prolonged periods, all with associated constraints and risks. In this work, we report on a software function and related models developed to rescale and regenerate pulse height data acquired from a single {{scintillation detector}}. Such a function {{could be used to}} generate significant and varied pulse height data {{that can be used to}} integration-test algorithms that are capable of automatically response matching multiple detectors using pulse height spectra analysis. Furthermore, a function of this sort removes the dependence on multiple detectors, digital analyzers and calibration source.

40|$|Abstract: The First G-APD Cherenkov {{telescope}} (FACT) is {{the first}} telescope using silicon photon detectors (G-APD aka. SiPM). The use of Silicon devices promise a higher photon detection efficiency, more robustness and higher precision than <b>photo-multiplier</b> tubes. Since the properties of G-APDs depend on auxiliary parameters like temperature, a feedback system adapting the applied voltage accordingly is mandatory. In this presentation, the feedback system, developed and in operation for FACT, is presented. Using the extraction of a single photon-equivalent (pe) spectrum as a reference, it can be proven that the sensors can be operated with very high precision. The extraction of the single-pe, its spectrum up to 10 pe, its properties and their precision, {{as well as their}} long-term behavior during operation are discussed. As a by product a single pulse template is obtained. It is shown that with the presented method, an additional external calibration device can be omitted. The presented method is essential for the application of G-APDs in future projects in Cherenkov astronomy and is supposed to result in a more stable and precise operation than possible with <b>photo-multiplier</b> tubes...|$|E
