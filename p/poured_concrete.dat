Stefan, being a pilot, then used his valid identification card and its virtually unlimited access to hide the body at a construction site at the airport. The construction workers <b>poured</b> <b>concrete</b> over the corpse, unwittingly destroying the evidence.|$|E
5|$|As Stone & Webster {{began work}} on the {{production}} facilities, {{it became clear that}} building the township as well would be beyond its capacity. The Army therefore engaged the architectural and engineering firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill to design and build the township. The John B. Pierce Foundation were brought in as a consultant. In turn, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill brought in numerous subcontractors. This first phase of construction became known as the East Town. It included some 3,000 family dwellings, an administrative center, three shopping centers, three grade schools for 500 children each and a high school for 500, recreation buildings, men's and women's dormitories, cafeterias, a medical services building and a 50-bed hospital. The emphasis was on speed of construction and getting around wartime shortages of materials. Where possible, fiberboard and gypsum board were used instead of wood, and foundations were made from concrete blocks rather than <b>poured</b> <b>concrete.</b> The work was completed in early 1944.|$|E
5|$|The Hotel Valley Ho is a {{striking}} example of the mid-century modern architectural style. Varney's use of masonry, cast and <b>poured</b> <b>concrete,</b> natural stone, and wide expanses of glass make for a close connection between the building and its environment. Stone floor and wall patterns link the exterior entry and the lobby, as does {{the extension of the}} redwood ceiling. The hotel is now considered one of the finest examples of organic architecture. Rooms in the two adjacent wings added in the late 1950s are unusual, and remarkably forward-thinking even by mid-century design standards, for their high nine-foot-ceilings. The prevailing trend at the time of original construction was low-ceilinged rooms, in some cases with ceilings only seven feet above ground level, but the Valley Ho's rooms feel exceptionally roomy and airy thanks to its original decision to buck design trends.|$|E

25|$|Concrete {{construction}} is prevalent among {{the homes and}} buildings in Scales Mound. Adam Rittweger constructed numerous distinctive concrete porches, garages, and foundations between 1908 and his death in 1933. There are several surviving examples of <b>poured</b> <b>concrete</b> constructed buildings in Scales Mound including the 1923 one story electrical generating plant, and Lewis Richard's 1911 restaurant. There is one surviving example in Scales Mound of a stucco clad and <b>poured</b> <b>concrete</b> construction combination, Louis Durrstein's implement dealership. It is presumed that Rittweger also introduced stucco finishes to Scales Mound between the late 1900s and early 1910s.|$|E

Castellano's son Philip was the president of Scara-Mix Concrete Corporation, which exercised a near monopoly on Staten Island on construction concrete. Castellano also handled the Gambino interests in the [...] "Concrete Club," [...] a consortium of mob families that divided revenue from New York developers. No one could <b>pour</b> <b>concrete</b> for a project worth more than $2 million without the approval from the Concrete Club. Finally, Castellano supervised Gambino control of Teamsters Union Local Chapter 282, which provided workers to <b>pour</b> <b>concrete</b> at all major building projects in New York and Long Island.|$|R

25|$|The entire {{movement}} of German architectural modernism {{was known as}} Neues Bauen. Beginning in June 1907, Peter Behrens' pioneering industrial design work for the German electrical company AEG successfully integrated art and mass production on a large scale. He designed consumer products, standardized parts, created clean-lined designs for the company's graphics, developed a consistent corporate identity, built the modernist landmark AEG Turbine Factory, and made full use of newly developed materials such as <b>poured</b> <b>concrete</b> and exposed steel. Behrens was {{a founding member of}} the Werkbund, and both Walter Gropius and Adolf Meyer worked for him in this period.|$|E
25|$|The {{world record}} for the largest {{continuously}} <b>poured</b> <b>concrete</b> raft was achieved in August 2007 in Abu Dhabi by contracting firm Al Habtoor-CCC Joint Venture and the concrete supplier is Unibeton Ready Mix. The pour (a part of {{the foundation for the}} Abu Dhabi's Landmark Tower) was 16,000 cubic meters of concrete poured within a two-day period. The previous record, 13,200 cubic meters poured in 54 hours despite a severe tropical storm requiring the site to be covered with tarpaulins to allow work to continue, was achieved in 1992 by joint Japanese and South Korean consortiums Hazama Corporation and the Samsung C Corporation for the construction of the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.|$|E
25|$|Belcourt's {{distinctive}} exterior {{appearance was}} achieved {{through the use}} of brick and Westerly granite to frame the windows, doors and fields of stucco. The roof is sheathed in Pennsylvania slate and is pierced by numerous ox-eye (elliptical) dormer windows. The interior, completed by 300 imported artisans, was created of carved oak with oak and mosaic marble floors. The numerous decorative ceilings were finished with sculpted and moulded plaster and carved woods (such as chestnut). The walls are finished with canvas paintings, carved oak, imported paneling and pure silk damasks. The numerous exterior railings and gates are composed of wrought iron and bronze, featuring a shell motif and the monogram 'OB'. The foundations are stone, brick and <b>poured</b> <b>concrete</b> with thick brick walls supporting enormous roof timbers and steel I-beams.|$|E

25|$|The 55 foot (16.8 m) {{diameter}} Gerald Harbach Round Barn stands upon a <b>poured</b> <b>concrete</b> foundation {{near the}} unincorporated community of Eleroy in Stephenson County, Illinois, United States. The wood sided exterior has been covered in asphalt since the building's construction. The barn's main, ground level entrance, {{is in the}} west quadrant and over the entrance is the loft door which is a rectangular opening in the ceiling. Each rafter of the single hip roof is braced with a nailed beam four feet (1.2 m) above and four feet (1.2 m) below, on the opposite side, the roof hip. In addition, there are beams nailed diagonally between the studs in the loft to brace the building against strong winds. The roof exterior is capped with a short cupola.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of the facility is above ground. The only part that is underground is a subterranean corridor that links cellblocks to the lobby. Inmates spend 23 hours a day locked in their cells and are escorted by {{a minimum of three}} officers for their five hours of private recreation per week. Each cell has a desk, a stool, and a bed, which are almost entirely made out of <b>poured</b> <b>concrete,</b> as well as a toilet that shuts off if blocked, a shower that runs on a timer to prevent flooding, and a sink lacking a potentially dangerous tap. Rooms may also be fitted with polished steel mirrors bolted to the wall, an electric light that can be shut off only remotely, a radio, and on rare occasions, a black-and-white television that shows recreational, educational, and religious programming. In addition, all cells are soundproofed to prevent prisoners from communicating with each other via Morse code.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, gold mining had petered out and Hearst began buying up property in the area. Over the next two decades, he amassed land holdings covering the entirety of four of the ten Mexican land grants and most of Jolon. On top of the old Rancho Milpitas main ranch house site, {{at the edge of a}} small bluff less than a mile from and overlooking the old mission, Hearst hired Morgan to build a new ranch headquarters. Construction on the Mission Revival-styled building complex began in 1929, using <b>poured</b> <b>concrete</b> instead of adobe. A smoothly domed north tower was built in Moorish Revival style above the main living quarters. Original plans for the building were for it to include housing for 20 employees but this was expanded to 30 during construction. A proposed southern wing for Hearst's private quarters was never completed. Materials were carried from Santa Cruz in a Fageol truck. Construction costs totaled $200,000.|$|E
