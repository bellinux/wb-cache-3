5000|$|On December 9, 2005 while {{attempting}} to navigate to calm waters in the Bay of Praia do Fajã, the container vessel CP Valour, a Bermudan-registered ship, originally traveling between Montreal, Canada and Valencia, Spain, ran aground 300 m from the coast. It was transporting 800 containers, of which three were environmentally hazardous, and the vessel was filled with two thousand tons of fuel oil. The tugboats [...] "São Luís" [...] (from the port of Horta) and [...] "São Miguel" [...] (from the port of Ponta Delgada) were called out to assist the crippled vessel, and were later aided by the Russian tug [...] "Fortiy Frilov" [...] (in order to stabilize the ship in northerly swells). However, the bay's currents forced the ship further to shore, forcing the abandonment of the ship on 25 December. The hulls eventually breached, causing an oil spill into the bay and onto the beach at Fajã. Similarly, some containers containing toxic fire retardant, flammable ink and paint and sodium <b>persulphate</b> were affected, and several containers were damaged or destroyed during the incident, leaking their contents into the bay. In the report on the accident, the Marine Accident Investigation Branch noted several failures including lack of crew management and procedures {{on the part of}} the operator, the inexperience and lack of seamanship of the master, and lack of proper nautical charts and anchoring experience. The accident brought world attention to Fajã da Praia, Faial and the Azores.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Observatoire National des Asthmes Professionnels (ONAP) {{was created}} in 1996 by two French {{professional}} societies to estimate the incidence of occupational asthma and to promote preventive measures against it. Occupational and chest physicians were asked to report newly diagnosed cases of work-related asthma and reactive airway dysfunction syndrome (RADS), the infor-mation collected included age, sex, occupation, suspected causal agents and diagnostic methods. In 1997, 82. 3 % of 559 cases reported (64 % males, mean age 36 ¡ 13 yrs) involved occupational asthma, 4. 7 % RADS and 12. 7 % atypical asthma syndromes. Incidence rates (expressed as number of cases per million workers) showed a regional variation that ranged from 4 to 73 (national mean: 25. 7). The most frequently suspected agents were flour (23. 3 %), followed by isocyanates (16. 6 %), latex (7. 5 %), aldehydes (5. 5 %), and <b>persulphates</b> (4. 1 %). Occupations at risk were bakers (23. 9 %), healthcare workers (12 %), painters (9. 1 %), hairdressers (5. 2 %), wood industry workers (4. 8 %) and cleaners (3. 5 %).

40|$|Background: The {{significant}} value of tests used to certify {{the diagnosis of}} occupational asthma due to <b>persulphate</b> salts remains uncertain. Aims: To validate the specific inhalation challenge (SIC) test for the diagnosis of occupational asthma. Methods: Eight patients with occupational asthma due to <b>persulphate</b> salts, eight patients with bronchial asthma who were never exposed to <b>persulphate</b> salts, and ten healthy subjects were studied. Clinical history taking, spirometry, bronchial challenge with methacholine, skin prick testing to common inhalant allergens and <b>persulphate</b> salts, total IgE levels, and SIC to potassium <b>persulphate</b> were carried out in all subjects. The SIC used increasing concentrations of potassium <b>persulphate</b> (5, 10, 15, and 30 g) mixed with 150 g of lactose. Patients tipped the mixture from one tray to another {{at a distance of}} 30 cm from the face for 10 minutes in a challenge booth.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Hair bleaches {{containing}} persulphates {{have been}} identified as the cause of occupational asthma in hairdressers. Also employees in <b>persulphate</b> production with occupational asthma have been described. It was the aim of this study to give an estimate of the prevalence of asthma due to persulphates in chemical workers with exposure to ammonium and sodium <b>persulphate.</b> METHODS: A cross sectional study was performed in 32 of 33 employees of a <b>persulphate</b> producing chemical plant. Eighteen of 23 workmen from the same plant with no exposure to persulphates were taken as controls. Also, information was collected from medical records of the seven subjects who had left the <b>persulphate</b> production for medical reasons since 1971. Data were recalled by a questionnaire, skin prick tests were performed with five environmental allergens, and ammonium and sodium <b>persulphate</b> (80 mg/ml). Specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) to the same environmental allergens as in the skin test, and total IgE were measured. Lung function and bronchial responsiveness to histamine were assessed by standard procedures. Workplace concentrations of ammonium and sodium <b>persulphate</b> were estimated by area and personal monitoring. The amount of <b>persulphate</b> was analysed as sulphur by inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry. RESULTS: Work related rhinitis was reported by one subject with exposure to persulphates, conjunctivitis and bronchitis were reportedly related to work by two controls. There were no cutaneous reactions to persulphates in either group. Four non-atopic subjects exposed to persulphates, and two controls, one atopic and one non-atopic, were considered to be hyperresponsive to histamine. Three subjects exposed to persulphates with bronchial hyperresponsiveness (provocation dose of histamine causing a 15 % fall in forced expiratory volume in one second (PD 15 FEV 1) or = 20 %, the rest refused peak flow measurements. None of the variables showed significant differences between the groups (P > 0. 05). Six of the exworkers left because of work related contact dermatitis. Mean values for workplace concentrations of ammonium and sodium <b>persulphate</b> within the bagging plant were below 1 mg/m 3, and the maximal concentrations were 1. 4 mg/m 3 and 3. 6 mg/m 3, respectively. CONCLUSION: Exposure to workplace concentrations of ammonium and sodium <b>persulphate</b> of about 1 mg/m 3 in this chemical plant was not associated with a risk of occupational asthma...|$|E
40|$|Petroleum {{hydrocarbon}} (PHC) contamination poses {{a serious}} threat to aquifer systems worldwide. Accidental releases of PHCs due to gasoline spills and leakage from underground storage tanks can often result in PHC subsurface contamination. The main compounds of concern associated with gasoline spills are benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX), trimethylbenzenes (TMBs) and naphthalene, due to their high mobility and potential human health risks. Sodium <b>persulphate</b> is one of the newest oxidants to gain widespread use for in situ chemical oxidation (ISCO), however its effectiveness in treating PHCs is not fully understood. In this study, the ability to use unactivated sodium <b>persulphate</b> as a remediation tool in treating dissolved and residual BTEX contamination was tested during a bench-scale laboratory study and within a pilot-scale field investigation. In both cases unactivated sodium <b>persulphate</b> was used at a concentration of 100 g/L. A laboratory-scale degradation potential batch test was conducted to assess the efficacy of unactivated sodium <b>persulphate</b> to oxidize petroleum hydrocarbon contaminated groundwater in conjunction with aquifer material from a field site. Data from the control reactions indicated that <b>persulphate</b> was stable for the entire 35 -day experimental period and that the decrease in PHC concentrations for most of the samples followed a first-order degradation. The behaviour and ability for sodium <b>persulphate</b> to oxidize dissolved and residual BTEX contamination was further evaluated in a controlled pilot scale field study. 200 kg of sodium <b>persulphate</b> was dissolved in 2000 L of water and injected into the subsurface. Electrical conductivity (EC), pH, sodium, <b>persulphate,</b> sulphate and BTEX concentrations were all monitored throughout the 158 -day study period. Field research showed that there was a strong correlation between EC and sodium concentrations. Hence, this relationship allowed for real-time EC measurements to be used to effectively predict the extent of the injectate. Based on the calculated aqueous density of sodium <b>persulphate</b> at a concentration of 100 g/L, predicted simulation model results and observed tracer field results, density effects were present and played a very important role in the transport of the injectate. The heterogeneous geology of the site also greatly influenced the transport of the injectate. The majority of the injectate appeared to have flowed out of the layers with higher hydraulic conductivity that intersected the upper and lower portion of the injection well’s screen length. The extent of the injected slug in the layers with lower hydraulic conductivity located in the centre portion of the injection well’s screen length was less in comparison. In general, areas with elevated tracer, <b>persulphate</b> and sulphate concentrations, also showed a decrease in BTEX concentration. Four main responses were observed. Group 1 consists of sampling points where tracer levels were elevated along with a corresponding short-term decrease in dissolved BTEX. Group 2 consists of sampling points where elevated tracer levels was observed along with a long-term apparent decrease in dissolved BTEX. Group 3 consists of sampling points where the tracer was elevated however dissolved BTEX levels remained essentially at background levels. And finally, group 4 consists of sampling points where the tracer was not observed to be elevated hence no decrease in dissolved BTEX was observed. Laboratory studies showed that the oxidation of BTEX compounds by unactivated sodium <b>persulphate</b> could be very successful. However, field study results showed that complexities such as heterogeneity of the field site and injectate density effects {{play a key role in}} the success of the remediation system...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: A {{voluntary}} {{surveillance system}} was implemented in Catalonia (Spain) {{to ascertain the}} feasibility, incidence, and characteristics of occupational respiratory diseases and compare them {{with those of the}} compulsory official system. Methods: In 2002, in collaboration with the Occupational and Thoracic Societies of Catalonia, occupational and chest physicians and other specialists were invited to report, on a bimonthly basis, newly diagnosed cases of occupational respiratory diseases. Information requested on each case included diagnosis, age, sex, place of residence, occupation, suspected agent, and physician’s opinion on the likelihood that the condition was work related.

40|$|Chemistry owes {{much to the}} {{catalytic}} {{forces which}} effect otherwise difficulty accomplished reactions. To catalysis Organic Chemistry owes the Grignard reagents, which have been employed not only for a multitude of simpler syntheses {{but also for the}} more complex syntheses of carbohydrates (Paal. Ber, 1905, 38 1656; 1906, 39, 1301, 2823, 2827) Frankland and Twiss J. C. S. 1905, 87, 864), of terpenss (Perkin J. C. S. 1907, 91, 480, Hesse Ber. 1909, 42, 1127, Mills and Bain J. C. S. 1910, 97, 1866) and of organo-silicon compounds (Kipping J. C. S. 1901 to 1909). Pope and Peachy effected resolutions of tin compounds with its aid. Chlorination is effected catalytically by suitable carriers. The Friedel and Crafte reaction is effected also by suitable halides. Numerous condensations such as the Benzoin condensation, the Aldol condensation, the Claisen condensation, and also esterification are catalytically effected. Equilibria between dynamic isomerides, in racemisation, and in mutarotation, are promoted by catalysis. Technical chemistry has, through catalysis, reversed the economic standing of nations. Cases in point are the synthesis of indigo, a stage in which is the catalytic oxidation of Napthalene by Sulphuric acid and Mercury, and the manufacture of sulphuric acids, of Ammonia and of Nitrates. The manufacture of synthetic petrols, power alcohols, and the new utilisations of coal depend entirely upon catalysts for their successful functioning. Analytical chemistry employs catalysts in processes of gas absorption such as addition of Uranyl Sulphate to Sulphuric Acid in the absorption of Ethylene (Lebeau and Damiens Compt. Rand. 1913, 156, 557) or of Corrosive Sublimate to alhaline Pyrogallol to accelerate the absorption of Oxygen. (Stassana, Compt. Rend. Soc. Biol. 1905, 58, 96). Also in Oxidation, such as the permanganate titration of iron in the presence of Hydrochloric and of Manganese Salts (Kessler. Pogg. Am. 1863, 118, 48; 119, 225), or the ability of Ferrous Sulphate to promote interaction between Potassium Persilphate and Potassium Iodide (Price Z Phys. Chem. 1898, 27, 474); and Reduction as in the employment of a Zinc-Copper Couple for the reduction of Chlorates to Chlorates (Thorpe and Eccles J. C. S. 1873, 26, 541; Bothamley and Thompson Ibid 1888, 53, 164). Catalysts are also employed in Organic analysis, as for example the use of colloidal platinum metals to convert Halogen compounds into Hydrogenated products and Halogen acid in the presence of Hydrogen (Borshe and Heimburger, Ber. 1915, 48, 452, 850). In Inorganic Chemistry a large number of reactions are catalytically accelerated. One of the best known is the decomposition of Potassium Chlorate in the Presence of Manganese Dioxide. Numerous catalyses are cited in the work of Dhar. (Ann. Chim. 11, 130 - 223, 1919). Hydrogen peroxide, another example of classical importance in chemical kinetics is decomposed by numerous agents, such as glass wool, salts of heavy metals, colloidal platinum. In Electrochemistry one may cite such examples as the addition of Fluorides in the preparation of <b>Persulphates</b> or percarbonates, (Muller and Friedberger, Z. Elektrochem., 1902, 8, 230), or the use of Lead Peroxide anodes in the oxidation of Chromates to Dichromates (Z. Elektrochem, 1905, 11, 863). Para-nitrotoluene with platinum anodes yields p-nitro-benzoic acid almost quantitatively. An enormous number of reactions is accelerated by radiant energy, according to photo chemical laws. A typical example is the union of Hydrogen and Chlorine, whose mechanism has occupied the attention of numerous workers. The photocatalytic combination of carbon-monoxide and Chlorine, of Sulphur Dioxide and Chlorine, of saturated, unsaturated, and aromatic hydro-carbons, and of acids (much as Acetic acid) and Chlorine furnish still further examples. Such reactions are further sensitive to the presence of ordinary material catalysts or anti-catalysts (See Griffiths and McKeowan, (“Photochemistry” p. 626. ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Hairdressers often {{complain}} of work-related rhinitis (WR). They are infrequently sensitized to persulphates. The cause and {{mechanism of the}} symptoms and the effects on their health-related quality of life (HRQoL) remains unclear. The objectives were to follow female hairdressers with WR mainly from bleaching powder regarding nasal reactivity to <b>persulphate</b> and to evaluate symptoms, HRQoL and inflammatory markers in nasal lavage during a working period after vacation and compared with hairdressers without symptoms and pollen allergic women. METHODS: Skin prick tests to <b>persulphate</b> were performed in the hairdressers. Participants kept a diary of symptoms and of work tasks (hairdressers only). They completed HRQoL questionnaires. Eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) in nasal lavage fluid was examined. The symptomatic hairdressers performed nasal challenges with <b>persulphate</b> {{before and after the}} exposure. RESULTS: Skin prick tests were negative. Although the nasal reactivity to <b>persulphate</b> did not change a steady increase in nasal symptoms, especially blockage, and in ECP was noticed in the symptomatic hairdressers. The HRQoL deteriorated in the symptomatic hairdressers indicating an effect on their working situation and daily life. The atopics had more, but varying symptoms (itching, sneezing and secretion). CONCLUSIONS: The difference in the clinical picture between the symptomatic hairdressers and the pollen allergic women, the increase in symptoms and ECP in the nasal lavage support the view that a sensitization to hairdresser chemicals by a mechanism not yet understood is operating.

40|$|This {{study was}} focused on the {{remediation}} of groundwater contaminated by 1, 4 -dichlorobenzene (DCB), 1, 2 -dichloropropane (DCP), benzene and iron. The aim of the research project was to evaluate the feasibility of chemical oxidation by sodium <b>persulphate</b> through laboratory tests. On the basis of previous results obtained by the authors on artificially contaminated groundwater, some batch tests have been carried out on water samples from the site. It was observed that high values of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and low content of dissolved iron led to decreasing removal efficiencies, due to the competition for the <b>persulphate</b> exerted by the natural organic matter in groundwater and to the lack of the catalyst, respectively.

40|$|The {{contamination}} of aquifer systems by petroleum hydrocarbons {{is a global}} problem. Underground storage tanks used for storing these hydrocarbons often leak, resulting in subsurface contamination. The hazards associated with petroleum hydrocarbon contamination are mainly attributable to the BTEX compounds, namely benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes together with trimethylbenzenes (TMBs) and naphthalene due to their potential to impact {{human health and the}} ease with which they can enter the groundwater system. In situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) is the delivery of strong chemical oxidants to the subsurface for the purpose of treating organic contaminants. ISCO can be an effective way to remediate organic contaminants from the soil and groundwater. Sodium <b>persulphate</b> is one of the newer oxidants to gain widespread use in treating petroleum hydrocarbon contamination, though without being fully understood. This investigation tested the ability of unactivated sodium <b>persulphate</b> in treating dissolved phase and residual BTEX contamination through bench-scale laboratory tests and a pilot-scale field study. A degradation potential batch reactor test was carried out to assess the efficacy of unactivated sodium <b>persulphate</b> in oxidizing petroleum hydrocarbons present in contaminated groundwater as well as its effect on aquifer material from a field site. This test was carried out at a sodium <b>persulphate</b> concentration of 20 g/L. Results from this test did not follow the expected first-order degradation, and so subsequent experiments were carried out using a sodium <b>persulphate</b> concentration of 100 g/L. A test to determine the degree of interaction between the oxidant and aquifer material was also conducted. It was found that the degree of natural oxidant interaction for the field site in question was very low. 1000 kg of sodium <b>persulphate</b> was dissolved in nearly 10, 000 L of water and injected into the subsurface. Electrical conductivity (EC), pH, sodium, <b>persulphate,</b> sulphate and BTEX were all monitored during the subsequent 152 -day post-injection monitoring period. An empirical relationship was determined between EC and the concentration of sodium in groundwater. This enabled the use of EC as a real-time tracer to track the progress of the injectate. Field results supported predictions based on a simulation model that density-driven flow would {{play an important role in}} the delivery of the injectate. A portion of the injectate was believed to have been missed by the monitoring network. Areas that did show elevated tracer results in some cases showed a decrease in BTEX concentrations. Results were categorized in four ways. The first category had wells that showed strong evidence of injectate presence but little to no change in BTEX levels. The second category was comprised of wells that showed a reduction in BTEX levels along with the presence of injectate. BTEX levels in some wells rebounded towards the end of the study period. The third category consisted of wells that showed the presence of dilute injectate but did not show any reduction in BTEX concentrations. The fourth and final category was of wells that showed no evidence of having been affected by the injectate in any way. BTEX levels were the same as background. The oxidation of BTEX by unactivated sodium <b>persulphate</b> was found to be successful, though the vagaries of oxidant delivery and field sampling made difficult the accurate determination of the degree of success...|$|E

In this study, photochemical oxidation processes (UV-A/K 2 S 2 O 8, UV-C/K 2 S 2 O 8) and chemical oxidation process (dark/K 2 S 2 O 8), were investigated in a laboratory scale photoreactor for decolorization of the Reactive blue 19 (RB 19) dye from synthetic textile wastewater. The effects of operating parameters such as potassium <b>persulphate</b> dosage, pH, reaction time and UV source, on decolorization have been evaluated. The results of direct chemical oxidation showed that 50 % of the dye was been removed using K 2 S 2 O 8 in dark condition after 5 h reaction time and photochemical oxidation showed that UV-C irradiation {{is more effective than}} UV-A for RB 19 dye removal. The RB 19 solution was completely decolorized under optimal potassium <b>persulphate</b> dosage of 5 mmol/L and low-pressure mercury UV-C lamps (15 w) in less than 30 min. UV/K 2 S 2 O 8 experiments showed higher color removal performance under acidic conditions (pH= 3), and in this condition with 5 mmol/L of potassium <b>persulphate,</b> 78. 5 % COD has been removed after 3 h irradiation time. The decolorization rate fitted to pseudo-first order kinetics with respect of dye concentration. The reaction rate constants for photochemical degradation of RB 19 were 0. 014 and 0. 237 for UV-A/K 2 S 2 O 8 and UV-C/K 2 S 2 O 8 processes respectively...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to find out the optimal {{degradation}} condition for two potential environmental pollutants, chloridazon and metribuzin (herbicide derivatives), employing advanced oxidation process using TiO 2 photocatalyst in aqueous suspensions. The degradation/mineralization of the herbicide was monitored by measuring the change in pollutant concentration and depletion in TOC content as a function of time. A detailed degradation kinetics was studied under different conditions such as types of TiO 2 (anatase/anatase-rutile mixture), catalyst concentration, herbicide concentration, initial reaction pH, and in the presence of electron acceptors (hydrogen peroxide, ammonium <b>persulphate,</b> potassium <b>persulphate)</b> in addition to atmospheric oxygen. The photocatalyst, Degussa P 25, was found to be more efficient catalyst for the degradation of both herbicides as compared with two other commercially available TiO 2 powders like Hombikat UV 100 and PC 500. Chloridazon (CHL) was found to degrade more efficiently under acidic condition, whereas metribuzin (MET) degraded faster under alkaline medium. All three electron acceptors tested in this study were found to enhance the degradation rate of both herbicides...|$|E
