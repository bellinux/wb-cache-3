40|$|Renal and cardiac {{diseases}} frequently co-exist and {{are associated}} with adverse outcomes. The clinical management of patients with a cardiorenal syndrome aims at reducing fluid overload and congestion, while improving kidney function. Early diagnosis and <b>prompt</b> <b>therapies</b> are key to better outcome. Biomarkers may help to gain insight on the ongoing pathological processes and since an accurate and early diagnosis of the cardiorenal syndrome based on clinical findings is not always possible. Serum creatinine, the derived eGFR and blood urea nitrogen are the standard tools for recognizing changes in renal function but suffer some limitations. In this review we will discuss the role of emerging biomarkers of renal tubular and glomerular injury, bone-mineral axis, or tubular cell-cycle arrest...|$|R

40|$|Is {{morphine}} {{indicated in}} {{acute pulmonary oedema}} Recent referrals to our intensive care unit have led us to question the indication for morphine in acute pulmonary oedema. Acute pulmonary oedema is a common, life-threatening emergency. Appropriate <b>prompt</b> <b>therapy</b> can provide rapid improvements in symptoms by reducing pre-load and after-load, or increasing myocardial contractility. Oxygen, loop diuretics, and nitrates are well-established therapeutic options.

5000|$|Doxycycline is the {{treatment}} of choice. If anaplasmosis is suspected, treatment should not be delayed while waiting for a definitive laboratory confirmation, as <b>prompt</b> doxycycline <b>therapy</b> {{has been shown to}} improve outcomes. Presentation during early pregnancy can complicate treatment. Doxycycline compromises dental enamel during development. Although rifampin is indicated for post-delivery pediatric and some doxycycline-allergic patients, it is teratogenic. Rifampin is contraindicated during conception and pregnancy.|$|R
40|$|Primary thalamic {{tumors are}} rare and {{bilateral}} thalamic tumors are even rarer. The incidence, clinical manifestations, {{natural history and}} prognosis of primary bilateral thalamic gliomas (PBTT) remain relatively obscure. In this article, four cases of bilateral thalamic gliomas are discussed and the available literature is reviewed. We conclude that primary bilateral thalamic tumors are distinct lesions, as proven by their specific neuroradiological and metabolic properties, unresponsiveness to radiotherapy and chemotherapy {{as well as a}} rapidly fatal clinical evolution. Early diagnosis and <b>prompt</b> <b>therapy</b> may delay the devastating effects of this tumor...|$|E
40|$|Two {{thirds of}} the {{exacerbations}} of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) are caused by infections of the respiratory tract. The causative microorganisms differ according to the degree of COPD severity, previous antibiotic therapy and prior bacterial infections. Antibiotics and intensification of bronchodilator therapy are the cornerstones of the management of moderate and severe exacerbations of COPD. <b>Prompt</b> <b>therapy</b> of COPD exacerbations has been shown to reduce the likelihood of hospitalisation and improve the quality of life. In this article, we have reviewed current recommendations regarding the use of antibiotics in the treatment of COPD exacerbations...|$|E
30|$|In our study, {{the very}} elderly cohort {{had a lower}} {{implementation}} of resuscitation bundles after sepsis diagnosis. Interestingly, this finding is in agreement with previous studies, showing that age is an independent factor for the limitation of treatment in critically ill patients. Does it reflect a poor encouragement from the attending physician to change patients’ outcome? Therefore, the older is the patient; the lower is the implementation of therapy. However, and despite of this common clinical sense, <b>prompt</b> <b>therapy</b> provided within the first 6  h of resuscitation {{was associated with a}} reduction in hospital mortality in this subgroup of patients.|$|E

40|$|We present 2 patients, {{who were}} {{admitted}} owing to rapidly progressing purpuric lesions due to postvaricella purpura fulminans, a coagulopathy leading to life- or limb-threatening thrombosis {{caused by a}} severe transient autoimmune protein S deficiency. Laboratory results were being consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation secondary to protein S deficiency; treatment with fresh frozen plasma, intravenous immunoglobulins, and prednisone was started. In our experience, a <b>prompt</b> <b>therapy</b> may limit the course {{and the extent of}} the disease. We present a review of the topic with supporting literature for the therapeutic options. Therefore, we should be reminded that purpura fulminans is a rare but severe complication of chickenpox, which demands quick action...|$|E
40|$|Acute {{progressive}} {{disseminated histoplasmosis}} (PDH) {{may be the}} initial manifestation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, cutaneous involvement is very rare. We present an unusual case of acute PDH with multiple diffuse cutaneous papulonodular lesions predominantly on the face, trunk, and upper extremities, diagnosed initially with fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). Subsequent serological tests revealed positivity for antibodies for HIV 1 and 2. The cytomorphological features were further confirmed by biopsy and histochemical stains. FNAC is a rapid, cost-effective tool that may be utilized in the diagnosis of papulonodular forms of PDH and for initiating <b>prompt</b> <b>therapy.</b> We discuss the clinical features, clinical differentials, and treatment of the condition...|$|E

50|$|Treatment {{guidelines}} {{call for}} the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics within the first hour following recognition of septic shock. <b>Prompt</b> antimicrobial <b>therapy</b> is important, as risk of dying increases by approximately 10% for every hour of delay in receiving antibiotics. Time constraints do not allow the culture, identification, and testing for antibiotic sensitivity of the specific microorganism responsible for the infection. Therefore, combination antimicrobial therapy, which covers {{a wide range of}} potential causative organisms, is tied to better outcomes.|$|R
30|$|Conclusion The {{mortality}} in our PICU is high, higher than predicted by PRISM. It occurred mainly within 24  h of admission.

40|$|Signs of sepsis may be obscure in {{patients}} with rheumatoid arthritis, particularly in association with long-term steroid therapy. If mortality is to be avoided, a high index of suspicion must be maintained for the diagnosis, and doubtful joints should be aspirated for culture and <b>prompt</b> <b>therapy</b> with the correct antibiotic. In this report a patients with advanced rheumatoid arthritis presented with bilateral shoulder dislocation due to septic arthritis. Ultrasonography was particularly helpful in guiding a 20 G needle to fluid collections with the debris-filled joint capsules and in facilitating successful aspiration. Ultrasound also provided a painless, noninvasive, and safe method of serial assessment of the joints after therapy...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} a 29 -year-old {{severely}} compromised acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patient who developed retrobulbar optic neuritis 5 weeks after an episode of cutaneous herpes zoster infection. During the optic neuritis, varicella zoster virus could be demonstrated in the cerebrospinal fluid. The neuritis responded well to treatment with foscarnet, but, 3 weeks into therapy, varicella zoster retinitis developed. Additional treatment with intravenous acyclovir stopped progression of the retinitis and resulted in healing of the retinal lesions. This case suggests that retrobulbar optic neuritis {{can be regarded as}} a prodrome of imminent acute retinal necrosis. Early recognition and <b>prompt</b> <b>therapy</b> with combined antivirals may prevent the development of this devastating ocular complication of varicella zoster infectio...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} case of a 75 -year-old-woman who {{presented}} with bilateral scalp ulcerations and blindness, accompanied by severe headache and scalp tenderness, due to bilateral temporal arteritis without systemic involvement. A biopsy taken from the border of an ulceration showed evidence of giant cell arteritis. She was treated with oral prednisone, 60 mg per day. The ulcerations healed in a few weeks but the vision loss was irreversible. This case highlights for temporal arteritis the importance of accurate and timely diagnosis as well as the need for <b>prompt</b> <b>therapy</b> with systemic steroids in order to avoid major complications, namely loss of vision. It also demonstrates that scalp necrosis and ulcerations are skin signs associated with a poor prognosis...|$|E
