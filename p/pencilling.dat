Since 2003, Brazelton's comic-creation process involved <b>pencilling</b> and inking the strip (with Micron pens) before scanning them into Paint Shop Pro to color them; by December 2006 he had switched to the Adobe Photoshop program, and was spending less time {{on the process of}} creating the comic and instead polishing it with his increasing software skill.|$|E

25|$|Scribing (also {{known as}} <b>pencilling</b> or writing) is the writing {{down of the}} scores and {{comments}} of judges at dressage events so that the judge can concentrate on the performance. In addition to this, the scribe should check the identity of each competitor, and ensure that the test papers are complete and signed before handing them to the scorers. The scribe should have some knowledge of dressage terminology, be smartly dressed and have legible handwriting. The scribe should also be professional in manner, neutral and not engage in small talk or make comments. It is permissible to use abbreviations provided they are accepted and intelligible.|$|E

In 1922 Eliot sent him the manuscript of The Waste Land, then arrived in Paris to edit it with Pound, who blue-inked the manuscript with comments like [...] "make up yr. mind..." [...] and [...] "georgian". Eliot wrote: [...] "I should like to think that the manuscript, with the suppressed passages, had disappeared irrecoverably; yet, on the other hand, I should wish the blue <b>pencilling</b> on it to be preserved as irrefutable evidence of Pound's critical genius." ...|$|E

2500|$|Byrne was {{followed}} by a quick succession of writers: Roger Stern, Tom DeFalco, and Roy Thomas. Steve Englehart took over as writer for issues 304–332 (except #320). The title had been struggling, so Englehart decided to make radical changes. He felt the title had become stale with the normal makeup of Reed, Sue, Ben, and Johnny, so in issue #308 Reed and Sue retired and were replaced with the Thing's new girlfriend, Sharon Ventura, and Johnny Storm's former love, Crystal. The changes increased readership through issue #321. At this point, Marvel made decisions about another Englehart comic, West Coast Avengers, that he disagreed with, and in protest he changed his byline to S.F.X. Englehart (S.F.X. is the abbreviation for Simple Sound Effects). In issue #326, Englehart was told to bring Reed and Sue back and undo the other changes he had made. This caused Englehart to take his name entirely off the book. He used the pseudonym John Harkness, which he had created years before for work he didn't want to be associated with. According to Englehart, the run from #326 through his last issue, #332, was [...] "one of the most painful stretches of [...] career." [...] Writer-artist Walt Simonson took over as writer with #334 (December 1989), and three issues later began <b>pencilling</b> and inking as well. With brief inking exceptions, two fill-in issues, and a three-issue stint drawn by Arthur Adams, Simonson remained in all three positions through #354 (July 1991).|$|E

40|$|The {{standard}} way {{of solving}} the polynomial eigenvalue problem associated with a matrix polynomial is to embed the matrix polynomial into a matrix <b>pencil,</b> transforming the problem into an equivalent generalized eigenvalue problem. Such <b>pencils</b> are known as linearizations. Many of the families of linearizations for matrix polynomials available in the literature are extensions of the so-called family of Fiedler <b>pencils.</b> These families are known as generalized Fiedler <b>pencils,</b> Fiedler <b>pencils</b> with repetition and generalized Fiedler <b>pencils</b> with repetition, or Fiedler-like <b>pencils</b> for simplicity. The goal of this work is to unify the Fiedler-like <b>pencils</b> approach with the more recent one based on strong block minimal bases <b>pencils</b> introduced in canonical. To this end, we introduce a family of <b>pencils</b> that we have named extended block Kronecker <b>pencils,</b> whose members are, under some generic nonsingularity conditions, strong block minimal bases <b>pencils,</b> and show that, {{with the exception of}} the non proper generalized Fiedler <b>pencils,</b> all Fiedler-like <b>pencils</b> belong to this family modulo permutations. As a consequence of this result, we obtain a much simpler theory for Fiedler-like <b>pencils</b> than the one available so far. Moreover, we expect this unification to allow for further developments in the theory of Fiedler-like <b>pencils</b> such as global or local backward error analyses and eigenvalue conditioning analyses of polynomial eigenvalue problems solved via Fiedler-like linearizations...|$|R
