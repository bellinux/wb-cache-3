40|$|We {{present one}} of largest studies to date of {{combined}} near-infrared and submillimeter linear polarization data for a giant molecular cloud. The dust polarized emission data (at 250, 350 and 500 mum) were obtained using the Balloon-borne Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope for Polarimetry (BLASTPol) during its 2012 Antarctic flight. The near-infrared polarization, which {{is produced by}} dichroic extinction of background starlight, was measured in the I band (0. 8 mum) using the Pico dos Dias Observatory in Brazil. The study targets the Vela C cloud, a conspicuous star-forming environment {{at a distance of}} approximately 700 pc, hosting HII regions, protostars, and dense filamentary structures. By studying the relationship between polarized emission and polarized absorption, we can investigate how this relates to the physical properties of dust grains. The area of overlap of the two data sets corresponds to a large fraction of the molecular cloud (approximately 1. 5 ° × 2. 0 °), with hundreds of combined polarization <b>pseudo-vectors</b> distributed mainly along the borders of the cloud. For most sight-lines, the inferred magnetic field orientations match within 20 °. Visual extinction values (AV) for near-infrared <b>pseudo-vectors</b> are estimated from 2 MASS photometry. Based on these extinction values, we determine and correct for a small foreground contribution (~ 0. 4 %) in the near-infrared sample. We calculate the polarization efficiency ratio, defined as the polarization fraction at 500 mum divided by the polarization efficiency in the near-infrared (defined as P/AV). Models of aligned dust grains are helpful for producing predicted polarization maps from numerical simulations of turbulent molecular clouds, and the polarization efficiency ratio provides a constraint for such dust alignment models. Preliminary results show that the measured polarization efficiency ratio appears to be roughly consistent with the predictions of the Draine and Fraisse (2009) models...|$|R

The equations give a possibility to describe the motion of both massive and massless particles with spin. All solutions of the equations of motion in the absence of external fields were found, and besides, we give more precise definition of a free object. It turns out that the massive particles always possess a longitudinal polarization. There are possible transversal motions of the following types: 1) oscillatory motion with proper frequency, 2) circular motion, and 3) complicated motion along rosette trajectories round the center of inertia with the velocity, varying in finite limits. Free massless particles can either fluctuate or move along complicated paths around fixed centers of balance, when the spin of the particles can have any direction.

40|$|The concept "Classical Electromagnetism" in {{the title}} of the paper here refers to a theory built on three foundations: {{relativity}} principles, the original Maxwell's equations, and the mathematics of exterior calculus. In this theory of electromagnetism the general laws are expressed as geometric (coordinate-free) relations between quantities on a four-dimensional spacetime manifold. Based on these laws, and exterior calculus on metric spaces, we derive fields and relations that describe electromagnetism from the inside perspective of Lorentz observers, inside the Minkowski spacetime (the ordinary flat spacetime). It is shown how fields and relations defined on the spacetime are sliced into three-dimensional fields and relations on time slices, and that Lorentz observers perceive these as time-dependent fields and relations on a single three-dimensional Euclidean space. In exterior calculus (on metric spaces) each field is associated to four field variants from which one can choose how a field is to appear. Using this feature, we derive alternative equation systems describing electromagnetism from the inside perspective. In one system, A, all field quantities are form fields. In another system, C, the fields are represented as vector and scalar fields. But in contrast to the traditional Maxwell's equations with div and curl operators, there is here no need for <b>pseudo-vectors</b> and pseudo-scalars. Some theorems of a pseudo-free vector analysis, adapted to the C-system, are derived.

40|$|Resumen del trabajo presentado al: "International Research Symposium on Chiral Magnetism" celebrado en Hiroshima (Japón) del 6 al 8 de diciembre de 2014. Because certain ambiguities in the {{conceptual}} definition of magnetic chirality, in this contribution {{the concept of}} chirality will be revised from both crystallographic and magnetic points of view. The term chirality, in a crystallographic sense, refers to the symmetry restriction {{of the absence of}} improper rotations in a crystal or in a molecule. A chiral space group can then only consist of pure rotations, pure translations, and screw rotations. Consequently, chiral crystals can occur in two different enantiomer forms, which are related by a difference in their handedness. These two enantiomer forms of a molecule or a crystal are mirror-related and not super-imposable (non congruent). Conceming magnetic structures a great variety of types have been described. The first classification regards translation properties of the magnetic structure via the propagation vector. Both commensurate, i. e. the magnetic lattice contains Q-rational times the nuclear lattice, and incommensurate structures can be found. If only the structural motif is considered then ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, collinear, non collinear, helical, fan, squared, modulated, etc., structures are observed. A magnetic structure is formed by an ordered arrangement of magnetic moments which transform as <b>pseudo-vectors</b> under symmetry operations. The mathematical tool necessary to describe such structure should be based on the symmetry transformations of the moments including the time-inversion as a new symmetry operation. Then, the 230 Space Groups, or Fedorov groups, are no longer valid to classify magnetic structures, as they do not include time-inversion as symmetry operation. Inclusion of such operation in the Fedorov groups leads to the 1651 Shubnikov groups that help to classify most magnetic structures. There are however some magnetic structures like the helical ones that can not be described by Shubnikov groups and further generalizations are required, e. g., magnetic superspace groups, etc. If the conditions leading to chirality in a nuclear lattice are weli defined, {{it does not seem to}} he such in the case of magnetic structures. In this contrihution we generalize the crystallographic definition to the case of magnetic space groups, including the time inversion symmetry. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

These particles play no role in this work and our argument is only based in, that the violation of the Bianchi identities, cannot be accounted at the action level with only the standard gauge field.

40|$|In the Wigner-covariant rest-frame instant form of {{dynamics}} it {{is possible}} to develop a relativistic kinematics for the N-body problem which solves all the problems raised till now on this topic. The Wigner hyperplanes, orthogonal to the total timelike 4 -momentum of any N-body configuration, define the intrinsic rest frame and realize the separation of the center-of-mass motion. The point chosen as origin of each Wigner hyperplane can be made to coincide with the covariant non-canonical Fokker-Pryce center of inertia. This is distinct from the canonical <b>pseudo-vector</b> describing the decoupled motion of the center of mass (having the same Euclidean covariance as the quantum 1 Newton-Wigner 3 -position operator) and the non-canonical <b>pseudo-vector</b> for the Møller center of energy. These are the only external notions of relativistic center of mass, definable only in terms of the external Poincaré group realization. Inside the Wigner hyperplane, an internal unfaithful realization of the Poincaré group is defined while the analogous three concepts of center of mass weakly coincide due to the first class constraints defining the rest frame (vanishing of the internal 3 -momentum). This unique internal center of mass is consequently a gauge variable which, through a gauge fixing, can be localized atthe origin of the Wigner hyperplane. An adapted canonical basis of relative variables is found by means of the classical counterpart of the Gartenhaus-Schwartz transformation. The invariant mass of the N-body configuration is the Hamiltonian for the relative motions.
