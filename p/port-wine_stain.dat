50|$|<b>Port-wine</b> <b>stains,</b> {{also known}} as nevus flammeus and {{sometimes}} mistaken for strawberry marks, are present at birth and range from a pale pink in color, to a deep wine-red. Irregular in appearance, they are usually quite large, and caused by a deficiency or absence in the nerve supply to blood vessels. This causes vasodilation, the dilation of blood vessels, causing blood to pool or collect in the affected area. Over time, <b>port-wine</b> <b>stains</b> may become thick or develop small ridges or bumps, and do not fade with age. Such birthmarks may have emotional or social repercussions. <b>Port-wine</b> <b>stains</b> occur in 0.3% of the population, equally among males and females. They frequently express unilaterally, i.e., on only one side, not crossing the midline of the body. Often on the face, marks on the upper eyelid or forehead may be indicative of a condition called Sturge-Weber syndrome. Additionally, <b>port-wine</b> <b>stains</b> in these locations {{may be associated with}} glaucoma and seizures.|$|R
25|$|The {{prominent}} crimson <b>port-wine</b> <b>stain</b> birthmark on Gorbachev's forehead was {{the source}} of much attention from critics and political cartoonists, who often illustrated the mark as the communist Hammer and Sickle.

If the <b>port-wine</b> <b>stain</b> is on the face or other highly visible part of the body, its presence can also cause emotional and social problems for the affected person.|$|E

2500|$|The novel sparked {{discussion}} {{over the}} use of plastic surgery to improve one's looks. The author said he has “received many letters from girls who have decided against having surgery since reading Uglies,” while others, sparked by Uglies, have started to ponder the ethics of changing your body’s appearance. [...] Westerfeld has theorized that “having extreme cosmetic surgery will be like buying a $1,000 Gucci bag, an indication that you are a member of the privileged class." [...] Critics echo his opinion. However, Westerfeld has also stated he “wouldn’t hesitate [...] if he had a kid with <b>port-wine</b> <b>stain.</b> We have all been altering our appearances ever since clothing was invented.” Other critics have stated that while altering one's appearance with plastic surgery can be ethically debatable, the benefits of it to people who have need for it are tremendous.|$|E

40|$|Since their {{introduction}} in dermatology, lasers {{became a}} welcome {{addition to the}} therapeutic armentarium for disfiguring skin conditions. In this thesis, we evaluated laser therapy {{for the treatment of}} scars, of benign dermal tumours, and of <b>port-wine</b> <b>stains.</b> For scars, many different laser devices have been proposed. In this thesis, we performed a review that showed the pulsed dye laser most effective in hypertrophic scars. We did not find enough evidence for the efficacy of ablative fractional laser in the treatment of various scar types. Also, significant side effects have occurred in patients treated with ablative fractional lasers. Although dermal tumours are benign, they may occur in high numbers and when they do, surgery is not an option. When timed exposure settings are used in ablative lasers, patients are offered a simple and fast treatment with uniform results, regardless of the person that controls the laser. The histological findings in this thesis complement the clinical results of timed exposure ablative laser therapy, seen in our daily practice. For the treatment of <b>port-wine</b> <b>stains,</b> sufficient evidence has been provided that the pulsed dye laser can now be regarded as the gold standard. Since a considerable number of <b>port-wine</b> <b>stains</b> still does not respond to this treatment, parameters have been varied and other lasers have been proposed. Until now, no laser has surpassed the pulsed dye laser in the treatment of <b>port-wine</b> <b>stains,</b> although we found that the Nd:YAG laser is a good option for the treatment of hypertrophy in <b>port-wine</b> <b>stains...</b>|$|R

50|$|Weber's {{syndrome}} {{is the only}} form of alternating hemiplegia that is somewhat easy to diagnose beyond the general criteria. Although Weber's {{syndrome is}} rare, a child born with the disorder typically has a <b>port-wine</b> <b>stain</b> on the face around the eye. While the <b>port-wine</b> <b>stain</b> {{does not necessarily mean}} the child has Weber's syndrome, if the <b>port-wine</b> <b>stain</b> involves the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve than the likelihood of it being weber's syndrome greatly increases. If a <b>port-wine</b> <b>stain</b> around the eye is found, the patient should be screened for intracranial leptomeningeal angiomatosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)can be used to determine the presence and severity while computed cranial tomography can be used to determine the effect. MRI is the preferred diagnostic test on children presenting with <b>port-wine</b> <b>stain.</b> Other imaging techniques can be used in addition to further determine the severity of the disorder. The initial diagnosis is made based on the presence of neurologic and ophthalmic disease but the disease progresses differently in each patient so after initial diagnosis the patient should be monitored frequently in order to handle further complications resulting from the syndrome.|$|E

50|$|Higher eumelanin levels {{also can}} be a disadvantage, however, beyond a higher {{disposition}} toward vitamin D deficiency. Dark skin is a complicating factor in the laser removal of <b>port-wine</b> <b>stains.</b> Effective in treating white skin, in general, lasers are less successful in removing <b>port-wine</b> <b>stains</b> in people of Asian or African descent. Higher concentrations of melanin in darker-skinned individuals simply diffuse and absorb the laser radiation, inhibiting light absorption by the targeted tissue. In similar manner, melanin can complicate laser treatment of other dermatological conditions in people with darker skin.|$|R
40|$|<b>Port-wine</b> <b>stains</b> (PWS) are {{capillary}} malformations, typically {{located in}} the dermis {{of the head and}} neck, affecting 0. 3 % of the population. Current theories suggest that <b>port-wine</b> <b>stains</b> are caused by somatic mutations that disrupt vascular development. Understanding PWS genetic determinants could provide insight into new treatments. Our study used a custom next generation sequencing (NGS) panel and digital polymerase chain reaction to investigate genetic variants in 12 individuals with isolated <b>port-wine</b> <b>stains.</b> Importantly, affected and healthy skin tissue from the same individual were compared. A subtractive correction method was developed to eliminate background noise from NGS data. This allowed the detection of a very low level of mosaicism. A novel somatic variant GNAQ, c. 547 C>G, p. Arg 183 Gly was found in one case with 4 % allele frequency. The previously reported GNAQ c. 548 G>A, p. Arg 183 Gln was confirmed in 9 of 12 cases with an allele frequency ranging from 1. 73 to 7. 42 %. Digital polymerase chain reaction confirmed novel variants detected by next generation sequencing. Two novel somatic variants were also found in RASA 1, although neither was predicted to be deleterious. This is the second largest study on isolated, non-syndromic PWS. Our data suggest that GNAQ is the main genetic determinant in this condition. Moreover, isolated <b>port-wine</b> <b>stains</b> are distinct from capillary malformations seen in RASA 1 disorders, which will be helpful in clinical evaluation...|$|R
