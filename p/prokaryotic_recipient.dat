The current model describes the T 6 SS as an inverted phage tail composed of a sheath-like structure wrapped around a tube assembled by stacked Hcp hexamers. Although recent {{progress has been made}} to understand T 6 SS sheath assembly and dynamics, {{there is no evidence that}} Hcp forms tubes in vivo. Here we show that Hcp interacts with TssB, a component of the T 6 SS sheath. Using a cysteine substitution approach, we demonstrate that Hcp hexamers assemble tubes in an ordered manner with a head-to-tail stacking that are used as a scaffold for polymerization of the TssB/C sheath-like structure. Finally, we show that VgrG but not TssB/C controls the proper assembly of the Hcp tubular structure. These results highlight the conservation in the assembly mechanisms between the T 6 SS and the bacteriophage tail tube/sheath...|$|E

The process is mediated by a membrane-spanning multiprotein assembly. Potential NTPases {{belonging to the}} VirB 11 family are {{an essential part of}} the membrane-spanning complex. Three representatives of these NTPases originating from the conjugative trans-fer regions of plasmids RP 4 (TrbB) and R 388 (TrwD) and from the cag pathogenicity island of Helicobacter pylori (HP 0525) were overproduced and purified in native form. The proteins display NTPase activity with distinct substrate specificities in vitro. TrbB shows its highest specific hydrolase activity with dATP, and the preferred substrate for HP 0525 is ATP. Analysis of defined TrbB mutations altered in motifs conserved within the VirB 11 protein family shows that there is a correlation between the loss or reduction of NTPase activity and transfer frequency. Tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy of TrbB and HP 0525 suggests that both interact with phospholipid membranes, changing their conformation. NTPase activity of both proteins was stimulated by the addition of certain phospholipids. According to our results, Virb 11 -like proteins seem to most likely be involved in the assembly of the membrane-spanning multiprotein complex. Translocation of macromolecules across the cell envelope of gram-negative bacteria is facilitated by multiprotein complexe...|$|E
