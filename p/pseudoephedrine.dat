5|$|Finally, Stephen G. Davies of Oxford has {{designed}} a chiral auxiliary that combines the functionality of the Weinreb amide {{with that of}} the Myers’ <b>pseudoephedrine</b> auxiliary, allowing diastereoselective enolate alkylation followed by facile cleavage to the corresponding enantioenriched aldehyde or ketone.|$|E
5|$|Some jurisdictions {{limit the}} sale of lithium batteries, which are the most readily {{available}} source of lithium for ordinary consumers. Lithium {{can be used to}} reduce <b>pseudoephedrine</b> and ephedrine to methamphetamine in the Birch reduction method, which employs solutions of alkali metals dissolved in anhydrous ammonia.|$|E
5|$|In adults {{short term}} use of nasal decongestants {{may have a}} small benefit. Antihistamines may improve {{symptoms}} in the first day or two; however, there is no longer-term benefit and they have adverse effects such as drowsiness. Other decongestants such as <b>pseudoephedrine</b> appear effective in adults. Ipratropium nasal spray may reduce the symptoms of a runny nose but has little effect on stuffiness. The safety and effectiveness of nasal decongestant use in children is unclear.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid is a weak {{monoamine oxidase}} {{inhibitor}} (MAOI), {{and should not}} be used concomitantly with other MAOIs, large amounts of tyramine-rich foods (such as pork, aged cheeses, alcoholic beverages, or smoked and pickled foods), or serotonergic drugs. There have been postmarketing reports of serotonin syndrome when linezolid was given with or soon after the discontinuation of serotonergic drugs, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as paroxetine and sertraline. It may also enhance the blood pressure-increasing effects of sympathomimetic drugs such as <b>pseudoephedrine</b> or phenylpropanolamine. It should also not be given in combination with pethidine (meperidine) under any circumstance due to the risk of serotonin syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Codral (made by Asia-Pacific {{subsidiary}} of Johnson & Johnson) — Codral Original contains <b>pseudoephedrine,</b> Codral New Formula substitutes phenylephrine for <b>pseudoephedrine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Contac (made by GlaxoSmithKline) — {{previously}} contained <b>pseudoephedrine,</b> now contains phenylephrine. As at Nov 2014 UK version still contains 30mg <b>Pseudoephedrine</b> Hydrochloride per tablet.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pseudoephedrine</b> may be quantitated in blood, plasma or urine {{to monitor}} any {{possible}} performance-enhancing use by athletes, confirm {{a diagnosis of}} poisoning or assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Many commercial immunoassay screening tests directed at the amphetamines cross-react appreciably with <b>pseudoephedrine,</b> but chromatographic techniques can easily distinguish <b>pseudoephedrine</b> from other phenethylamine derivatives. Blood or plasma <b>pseudoephedrine</b> concentrations are typically in the 50–300µg/l range in persons taking the drug therapeutically, 500–3000µg/l in abusers or poisoned patients and 10–70mg/l in cases of acute fatal overdosage.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} reports of off-label uses of <b>pseudoephedrine</b> for its {{stimulant}} properties. Long-distance truck drivers and athletes, for example, have reportedly used <b>pseudoephedrine</b> as a stimulant to increase their state of alertness/awareness.|$|E
25|$|In the UK, <b>pseudoephedrine</b> is {{available}} {{over the counter}} {{under the supervision of}} a qualified pharmacist, or on prescription. In 2007, the MHRA reacted to concerns over diversion of ephedrine and <b>pseudoephedrine</b> for the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine by introducing voluntary restrictions limiting over the counter sales to one box containing no more than 720mg of <b>pseudoephedrine</b> in total per transaction. These restrictions became law in April 2008. However no form of ID is required.|$|E
25|$|The salts <b>pseudoephedrine</b> {{hydrochloride}} and <b>pseudoephedrine</b> sulfate {{are found}} in many over-the-counter preparations, either as a single ingredient or (more commonly) in combination with antihistamines, guaifenesin, dextromethorphan, and/or paracetamol (acetaminophen) or an NSAID (such as aspirin or ibuprofen).|$|E
25|$|Products {{whose only}} {{medicinal}} ingredient is <b>pseudoephedrine</b> {{must be kept}} behind the pharmacy counter. Products containing <b>pseudoephedrine</b> along with other medicinal ingredients may be displayed on store shelves but may be sold only in a pharmacy when a pharmacist is present.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pseudoephedrine</b> {{was on the}} IOC's banned {{substances}} list until 2004, {{when the}} World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) list replaced the IOC list. Although WADA initially only monitored <b>pseudoephedrine,</b> it is once again on the banned list starting January 1, 2010.|$|E
25|$|Common adverse drug {{reactions}} (ADRs) {{associated with}} <b>pseudoephedrine</b> therapy include {{central nervous system}} stimulation, insomnia, nervousness, excitability, dizziness and anxiety. Infrequent ADRs include tachycardia or palpitations. Rarely, <b>pseudoephedrine</b> therapy {{may be associated with}} mydriasis (dilated pupils), hallucinations, arrhythmias, hypertension, seizures and ischemic colitis; as well as severe skin reactions known as recurrent pseudo-scarlatina, systemic contact dermatitis, and nonpigmenting fixed drug eruption. <b>Pseudoephedrine,</b> particularly when combined with other drugs including narcotics, may also {{play a role in the}} precipitation of episodes of paranoid psychosis.|$|E
25|$|Increases in <b>pseudoephedrine</b> {{diversion}} were noted, {{beginning with}} the seizures in March and April 2003 of four shipments of product destined for Mexico. The seizures occurred in the United States and Panama, and totaled over 22 million, 60-milligram <b>pseudoephedrine</b> tablets. The source of supply {{has been identified as}} legitimate pharmaceutical companies in Hong Kong. Additional investigations have revealed other companies in Hong Kong that have been engaged in supplying substantial amounts of <b>pseudoephedrine</b> to firms, sometime fictitious, shells or fronts, in Mexico.|$|E
25|$|Health Canada has {{investigated}} {{the risks and}} benefits of <b>pseudoephedrine</b> and ephedrine/ephedra. Near the end of the study, Health Canada issued a warning on their website stating that those who are under the age of 12, or who have heart disease and may suffer from strokes, should avoid taking <b>pseudoephedrine</b> and ephedrine. Also, they warned that everyone should avoid taking ephedrine or pseudoephrine with other stimulants like caffeine. They also banned all products that contain both ephedrine (or <b>pseudoephedrine)</b> and caffeine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pseudoephedrine</b> is {{indicated}} {{for the treatment}} of nasal congestion, sinus congestion and Eustachian tube congestion. <b>Pseudoephedrine</b> is also indicated for vasomotor rhinitis, and as an adjunct to other agents in the optimum treatment of allergic rhinitis, croup, sinusitis, otitis media, and tracheobronchitis.|$|E
25|$|The {{antihypertensive}} {{effects of}} methyldopa, mecamylamine, reserpine and veratrum alkaloids {{may be reduced}} by sympathomimetics. Beta-adrenergic antagonists may also interact with sympathomimetics. Increase of ectopic pacemaker activity can occur when <b>pseudoephedrine</b> is used concomitantly with digitalis. Antacids increase the rate of <b>pseudoephedrine</b> absorption, while kaolin decreases it.|$|E
25|$|Methcathinone {{production}} utilizes the oxidation of <b>pseudoephedrine</b> or ephedrine, {{the former}} being preferred because of much higher yields achieved. Oxidation of <b>pseudoephedrine</b> to methcathinone requires little chemistry experience, making it (relatively) easy to synthesize. Potassium permanganate (KMnO4) is {{most commonly used}} as the oxidant.|$|E
25|$|Most {{states also}} have laws {{regulating}} <b>pseudoephedrine.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Pseudoephedrine</b> {{can be used}} {{either as}} oral or as topical decongestant. However, due to its {{stimulating}} qualities, the topical nasal preparation {{is more likely to}} cause adverse effects, including urinary retention. According to one study, <b>pseudoephedrine</b> may show effectiveness as an antitussive drug (suppression of cough).|$|E
25|$|In Turkey, {{medications}} containing <b>pseudoephedrine</b> {{are available}} with prescription only.|$|E

25|$|Its {{membership}} in the amphetamine class has made <b>pseudoephedrine</b> a sought-after chemical precursor in the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine and methcathinone. As {{a result of the}} increasing regulatory restrictions on the sale and distribution of <b>pseudoephedrine,</b> many pharmaceutical firms have reformulated, or {{are in the process of}} reformulating medications to use alternative, but less effective, decongestants, such as phenylephrine.|$|E
