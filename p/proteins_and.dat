However, the ultrastructural locations of the 60 -kDa Ro <b>protein</b> <b>and</b> its associated small cytoplasmic RNAs (Y RNAs) have not been previously determined, and {{the functions of the}} Ro <b>protein</b> <b>and</b> RNAs are not known. In this study, the cellular locations of the 60 -kDa Ro <b>protein</b> <b>and</b> the Ro Y 1 and Y 4 RNAs are determined by immunoelectron microscopy and in situ hybridization electron microscopy, respectively. Both Ro <b>protein</b> <b>and</b> Y RNAs are concentrated in discrete areas of the nucleoplasm, nucleolus, and cytoplasm of cultured cells and human skin sections. The 60 -kDa Ro <b>protein</b> <b>and</b> Y RNAs are also present diffusely in the cytoplasm, where they occur in ribosome-rich regions, and in the nucleus. The presence of Ro ribonucleoprotein components in nucleoli and in ribosome-rich cytoplasmic areas suggests a potential for the involvement of Y RNAs and/or 60 -kDa Ro protein in ribosome synthesis, assembly, or transport. Double labeling experiments show that Ro <b>protein</b> <b>and</b> Y RNAs colocalize in the nucleoplasm, nucleolus, and cytoplasm. In addition, aggregates of Y RNA occur unassociated with 60 -kDa Ro <b>protein,</b> <b>and</b> aggregates of 60 -kDa Ro protein occur unassociated with Y RNA.
