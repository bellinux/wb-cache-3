50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, PLAN begun to convert Qiongsha-class <b>cargo</b> <b>ship</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>ships</b> to {{ambulance}} transport {{to meet the}} urgent maritime/naval medical needs. A pair of Qiongsha-class converted {{was not enough to}} meet the need, so some other <b>cargo</b> <b>ships</b> that can also carry passengers were selected to be converted to <b>cargo</b> <b>ship,</b> medical evacuation (APR) to supplement the converted Qiongsha-class. The reason <b>cargo</b> <b>ships</b> that can also carrying passengers were specifically selected is because neither the <b>cargo</b> <b>ship</b> nor the passenger ship could meet the requirement for conversion: the <b>cargo</b> <b>ship</b> lacked the accommodation and comfort for crew and patient because it does not carry passengers, and passenger ship does not have the room needed to house the medical facilities and support equipment, so both types would require higher conversion cost because more work is needed for both types. In contrast, <b>cargo</b> <b>ship</b> that also carries passengers would cost less to convert to <b>cargo</b> <b>ship,</b> medical evacuation (APR) because it has what both <b>cargo</b> <b>ship</b> and passenger ship lack. As a result, Type Long March cargo-passenger ship was selected for conversion.|$|R
