25|$|A {{hand plane}} {{is a tool}} for shaping wood using muscle power to force the cutting blade over the wood surface. Some rotary power <b>planers</b> are {{motorized}} power tools used for {{the same types of}} larger tasks, but are unsuitable for fine scale planing where a miniature hand plane is used.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 19th century {{machinery}} was made mostly of wood with iron parts. By the mid century machines were being increasingly of all iron, which {{allowed them to}} operate at higher speeds and with higher precision. The demand for machinery created a machine tool industry that designed and manufactured lathes, metal <b>planers,</b> shapers and other precision metal cutting tools.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, the National Energy Commission (CNE) {{developed}} the National Plan for Rural Electrification (<b>PLANER),</b> which established goals and investment {{figures for the}} period 2004-2013. Its objective is to bring power to 90% of the country’s rural areas {{by the end of}} 2012. The Rural Electrification Policy was approved in September 2006 as the main guide for implementation of the <b>PLANER.</b>|$|R

25|$|Woodworking {{machinery}} that perform a similar function as hand planes include the jointer and the thickness planer, also called a thicknesser; the job these specialty power tools {{can still be}} done by hand <b>planers</b> and skilled manual labor {{as it was for}} many centuries. When rough lumber is reduced to dimensional lumber, a large electric motor or internal combustion engine will drive a thickness planer that removes a certain percentage of excess wood to create a uniform, smooth surface on all four sides of the board and in specialty woods, may also plane the cut edges.|$|E
25|$|The {{experience}} of the War of 1812 led the War Department to issue a request for contract proposals for firearms with interchangeable parts. Previously, parts from each firearm had to be carefully custom fitted; almost all infantry regiments necessarily included an artificer or armorer who could perform this intricate gunsmithing. The requirement for interchangeable parts forced forward the development of modern metal-working machine tools, including milling machines, grinders, shapers and <b>planers.</b> The Federal Armories perfected the use of machine tools by developing fixtures to correctly position the parts being machined and jigs to guide the cutting tools over the proper path. Systems of blocks and gauges were also developed to check the accuracy and precision of the machined parts. Developing the manufacturing techniques for making interchangeable parts by the Federal Armories took over two decades; however, the first interchangeable small arms parts were not made to {{a high degree of}} precision. It wasn't until mid century or later that parts for U.S. rifles and handguns could be considered truly interchangeable with a degree of precision. In 1853 when the British Parliamentary Committee on Small Arms questioned gun maker Samuel Colt, and machine tool makers James Nasmyth and Joseph Whitworth, there was still some question about what constituted interchangeability and whether it could be achieved at a reasonable cost.|$|E
2500|$|Manufacturing became well {{established}} during the mid 19th century. Labor in the U.S. was expensive and industry {{made every effort}} to economize by using machinery. Woodworking machinery such as circular saws, high speed lathes, <b>planers</b> and mortising machines and various other machines amazed the British as was reported by Joseph Whitworth.

2500|$|Having secured these contracts, Roach {{set about}} {{equipping}} the Etna Iron Works {{for its new}} role. He began by hiring Thomas Main, a leading engineer with experience {{in a number of}} the world's most advanced engine works, as the plant's superintendent. Roach then began reorganizing the Works, adding a boilershop, machine shop, coppersmith shop and blacksmith, and equipping the plant with a host of new machines including traveling and swing cranes and the steam engines to power them, along with <b>planers,</b> lathes, boring mills, punches, shears and rollers. Amongst the new equipment was a planer capable of finishing 100-ton iron plates, and a lathe capable of boring a [...] cylinder—the two largest machine tools in the entire country.|$|E
6000|$|Here, {{as we have}} said, above 3500 men {{and boys}} were at work, {{and all sorts of}} trades were represented.

Pattern-makers to make wooden patterns for castings. Moulders, including loam, dry-sand and green-sand moulders and brass-founders. Dressers to dress the rough edges off the castings when brought from the foundry. Turners in iron and brass. <b>Planers</b> and nibblers, and slotters and drillers. Joiners and sawyers, and coach-builders and painters. Fitters and erecters, to do the rougher and heavier part of fitting the engines together. Boiler-makers, including platers or fitters, caulkers and riveters. Finishers to do the finer part of fitting--details and polishing.

40|$|Stockholms läns {{regional}}a planeringsorgan vill utveckla sitt arbete med digitalisering inom regional <b>planering</b> med inriktning på ekologisk hållbarhet. Syftet med denna rapport är att bidra till detta arbete genom att jämföra och identifiera sätt som digitaliseringen behandlas i regional <b>planering</b> i syfte att nå ekologisk hållbarhet. Begreppet ”digitalisering” syftar på den process där teknik och {{digital information}} blir en del av samhället. Konceptet ”smart city” identifierades som intressant och tolkades om för en ”smart region”, och vad det skulle kunna innebära. Ingångar i frågorna skaffades i en workshop med Stockholmsregionens Tillväxtoch Regionplaneförvaltning, samt i en intervju med sakkunnig. Det genomfördes en studie av fem storstadsregioners regionplanedokument, och av litteratur om regional <b>planering,</b> digitalisering och ekologisk hållbarhet. Sju strategier för digitalisering och ekologisk hållbarhet i regional <b>planering</b> identifierades utifrån de regionala planeringsdokumenten. En digital plattform identifierades som ett möjligt sätt att arbeta med tjänster som är kopplade till strategierna. I litteraturen hittades analysverktyg vilka användes för att identifiera hur strategierna med digitalisering kan innebära ökad ekologisk hållbarhet. Efter det diskuterades hur den digitala plattformen kan samverka med regional <b>planering,</b> samt hur den digitala plattformen och samarbetsplattformen kan tolkas ur en planeringsteoretisk vinkel. The Stockholm County regional planning agency wants {{to develop its}} work on digitalisation in Regional Planning {{with a focus on}} ecological sustainability. The purpose of this report is to contribute to this work by comparing and identifying ways that digitalisation is treated in regional planning in order to achieve ecological sustainability. The concept of "digitalisation" refers to the process where technology and digital information becomes a part of the community. The concept of "smart city" was identified as interesting and was interpreted for a "smart region", and what this could entail. Starting points to the issues were gathered in a workshop with the Stockholm region's Growth and Regional Planning Administration, as well as in an interview with an expert. A study was conducted of the five metropolitan regions’ regional planning documents, and of literature on regional planning, digitalisation and ecological sustainability. Seven strategies for digitalisation and ecological sustainability in regional planning were identified {{on the basis of the}} regional planning documents. A digital platform was identified as a possible way to work with services that are linked to the strategies. In the literature analysis tools were found which were used to identify how the strategies of digitalisation can lead to increased environmental sustainability. After that it was discussed how the digital platform can interact with regional planning, as well as how the digital platform and the collaboration platform can be understood from a planning theoretical angle...|$|R

40|$|We solve an player general-sum {{differential}} game. The {{optimization problem}} considered here {{is based on}} the Uzawa-Lucas model of endogenous growth. Agents have logarithmic preferences and own two capital stocks. Since the number of players is an arbitrary fixed number, the model's solution is more general than the idealized concepts of the social <b>planer's</b> solution with one player or the competitive equilibrium with infinitely many players. We show that the symmetric Nash equilibrium is completely described by the solution to a single ordinary differential equation. The numerical results imply that the influence of the externality along the balanced growth path decreases rapidly as the number of players increases. Off the steady state, the externality is of great importance, even for a large number of players. ...|$|R

40|$|Forest {{lands are}} used in {{increasingly}} plural ways and serve society with numerous benefits. This paper analyses the views of private forest owners {{and the general public}} in Sweden on the values of the forest. Two main dimensions were identified: ‘preservation and recreation’ values, reflecting ecological and social aspects; and ‘production’ values, reflecting economic aspects. While the general public emphasised the importance of forest uses which cater to ecological and social forest values more strongly compared to the forest owners, no significant difference was found concerning economic forest values. This suggests that while there is scope for contestation over forest land use, there is also some potential for common ground across stakeholder groups. These findings add to the body of knowledge of the views on the use of forest lands, and can inform forest related planning, management and policy development. <b>Planering</b> för en dynamisk stads-landsbygdsrelation: att leva och verka på flera platse...|$|R
