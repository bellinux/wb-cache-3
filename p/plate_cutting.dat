40|$|While wood {{has long}} been the {{standard}} material for crossties, several factors have in recent years increased interest by the railroad community in possible alternative materials. These factors include increased wear due to higher loads, and environmental concerns associated with preservative chemical treatments. Several manufacturers have entered the market with a variety of plastic composite material designs. Some of these plastic composite ties have to various degrees been subjected to laboratory and field tests including the FAST in Pueblo, CO. Several thousands of plastic composite ties have been installed in track, ranging from mass transit to Class 1 revenue service applications. While these products have some performance attributes that make them attractive alternatives to wood, they also have some properties that are somewhat different than traditional wood materials and are not fully understood.

40|$|Purpose: In {{this paper}} {{the concept of}} {{automatic}} programs of the NC machine for metal <b>plate</b> <b>cutting</b> by genetic algorithm method has been presented. Design/methodology/approach: The paper was limited to automatic creation of NC programs for two-dimensional cutting of material by means of adaptive heuristic search algorithms. Findings: Automatic creation of NC programs in laser cutting of materials combines the CAD concepts, the recognition of features and creation and optimization of NC programs. The proposed intelligent system is capable to recognize automatically the nesting of products in the layout, to determine the incisions and sequences of cuts forming the laid out products. Position of incisions is determined at the relevant places on the cut. The system is capable to find the shortest path between individual cuts and to record the NC program. Research limitations/implications: It would be appropriate to orient future researches towards conceiving an improved system for three-dimensional cutting with optional determination of positions of incisions, with the capability to sense collisions and with optimization of the speed and acceleration during cutting. Practical implications: The proposed system assures automatic preparation of NC program without NC programer.

A multi-parameter optimization was carried out using the robust design. An L 18 (21 × 37) Taguchi orthogonal array experiment was conducted and the right bevel angle was measured, aiming at the investigation of the influence of plasma-arc cut process parameters on right side bevel angle of St 37 mild steel cut surface. The selection of quality characteristics, material, plate thickness and other process parameter levels and experimental limits was based on the experience and current needs of the Greek machining industry. A feed-forward backpropagation (FFBP) neural network was fitted on the experimental data.
