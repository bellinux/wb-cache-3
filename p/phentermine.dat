25|$|The {{combination}} of <b>phentermine</b> and topiramate, brand name Qsymia (formerly Qnexa) {{was approved by}} the U.S. FDA on July 17, 2012, as an obesity treatment complementary to a diet and exercise regimen. The European Medicines Agency, by contrast, rejected the combination as a treatment for obesity, citing concerns about long-term effects on the heart and blood vessels, mental health and cognitive side-effects.|$|E
25|$|On 12 August 2007, at the Tour of Elk Grove, O'Neill {{provided}} a sample which {{tested positive for}} the appetite suppressant drug <b>phentermine.</b> O'Neill received notification of this on 23 September 2007. Later, the B sample also tested positive, he admitted that he had used the medicine for the prescribed purpose out of competition. The drug was not banned for use out-of-competition, and O'Neill maintains that his error is due to a longer than expected clearance time for the drug, compounded by another supplement which increased his urinary pH that he was also taking {{in the days leading up}} to the event. On 6 November 2007, O'Neill was terminated by the Health Net Pro Cycling Team.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, <b>phentermine</b> {{had been}} FDA {{approved}} in 1959 and fenfluramine in 1973. The two {{were no more}} popular than other drugs until in 1992 a researcher reported that when combined the two caused a 10% weight loss which was maintained {{for more than two}} years. Fen-phen was born and rapidly became the most commonly prescribed diet medication. Dexfenfluramine (Redux) was developed in the mid-1990s as an alternative to fenfluramine with fewer side-effects, and received regulatory approval in 1996. However, this coincided with mounting evidence that the combination could cause valvular heart disease in up to 30% of those who had taken it, leading to withdrawal of Fen-phen and dexfenfluramine from the market in September 1997.|$|E
2500|$|Currently, no case of {{pulmonary}} hypertension has been noted. [...] (Fenfluramine, of the 1990s [...] "Fen-Phen" [...] combo, forced excess release of neurotransmitters—a different action. <b>Phentermine</b> was uninvolved in the rare—but clinically significant—heart issues of fenfluramine.) ...|$|E
2500|$|On 13 June 2008 the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) {{ruled that}} O'Neill bore [...] "no {{significant}} negligence" [...] in registering a positive finding for <b>Phentermine,</b> {{and was given}} a 15-month suspension, from 12August 2007 [...] 12November 2008.|$|E
2500|$|O'Neill's 2007 {{positive}} {{test for}} the prescription medication, <b>Phentermine,</b> {{for which he was}} legally prescribed, and which was legal OUT of competition, but not IN competition, there were then, and have been MANY high-profile positives since, revealed within the professional peloton, and these for actual performance enhancers, i.e., EPO, Growth Hormone, Steroids. These are medications that have NEVER been legal in the professional peloton, (Ivan Basso, Floyd Landis, Alejandro Valverde [...] Michael Rasmussen, Christian Vandevelde, George Hincapie, Tom Danielson, Levi Leipheimer, David Zabriski, Matt White, Lance Armstrong, etc. just to name a few.) In fact, one might assert that calling <b>Phentermine</b> a performance enhancer is specious. Quite possibly, O'Neill was made an example of, because of the other problems surfacing in the peloton, ASADA was determined to take a hard line on any doping, even for a substance that was legal out of competition. Perhaps, more nefarious intent, they simply wanted to divert attention from a much more insidious problem that they could not get a handle on, and would shake the foundations of the sport. Regardless, O'Neill wears the badge of [...] "Doper" [...] like every other positive test. The substance itself long forgotten.|$|E
2500|$|In 1994, {{sales of}} the {{combination}} drug Fen-phen (fenfluramine and <b>phentermine)</b> increased dramatically, as this combination produced substantial and apparent synergistic effect in promoting weight loss.

2500|$|The Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (ASADA), the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the UCI jointly {{appealed to}} the CAS to {{increase}} the suspension period [...] "on {{the grounds that the}} athlete had not demonstrated no significant fault or negligence". The CAS also stated that [...] "Also of importance is the evidence from Mr O’Neill that he took the risk because he was of the view that without <b>Phentermine</b> {{he was not going to}} be competitive.

On July 17, 2014, FedEx was indicted for {{conspiracy}} to distribute controlled substances {{in cooperation with the}} Chhabra-Smoley Organization and Superior Drugs.

50|$|In 1984, {{researchers}} at the University of Rochester Medical Center {{reported that they had}} performed a double-blind, controlled clinical trial comparing <b>phentermine</b> alone, fenfluramine alone, a combination of <b>phentermine</b> and fenfluramine, and placebo, for weight loss in humans. Weight loss in those receiving the fen-phen combination was significantly greater (8.4±1.1 kg) than in those receiving placebo (4.4±0.9 kg) and equivalent to that of those receiving fenfluramine (7.5±1.2 kg) or <b>phentermine</b> alone (10.0±1.2 kg). This amounts to an additional weight loss of 4±2 kg over the course of 24 weeks. Adverse effects were less frequent with the combination regimen than with the other active (non-placebo) treatments. The authors felt that combining fenfluramine and <b>phentermine</b> capitalized on their pharmacodynamic differences, resulting in equivalent weight loss, fewer adverse effects, and better appetite control.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Phentermine</b> {{has some}} {{similarity}} in its pharmacodynamics with its parent compound, amphetamine, as they both are TAAR1 agonists, where the activation of TAAR1 in monoamine neurons facilitates the efflux or, release into the synapse, of these neurochemicals; at clinically relevant doses, <b>phentermine</b> primarily {{acts as a}} releasing agent of norepinephrine in neurons, although, to a lesser extent, it releases dopamine and serotonin into synapses as well. [...] <b>Phentermine</b> may also trigger the release of monoamines from VMAT2, which is a common pharmacodynamic effect among substituted amphetamines. The primary mechanism of phentermine's action in treating obesity is the reduction of hunger perception, which is a cognitive process mediated primarily through several nuclei within the hypothalamus (in particular, the lateral hypothalamic nucleus, arcuate nucleus, and ventromedial nucleus). Outside the brain, <b>phentermine</b> releases norepinephrine and epinephrine - also known as noradrenaline and adrenaline respectively - causing fat cells to break down stored fat as well.|$|E
