40|$|Effects of {{landfall}} {{location and}} approach angle on track deflection {{associated with a}} tropical cyclone (TC) passing over an idealized and Central Appalachian Mountain is investigated {{by a series of}} idealized numerical experiments. When the TC landfalls on the central portion of the mountain range, it is deflected to the south upstream, passes over the mountain anticyclonically, and then moves westward downstream. The TC motion is steered by the <b>positive</b> <b>vorticity</b> tendency (VT) which is dominated by horizontal <b>vorticity</b> <b>advection</b> upstream and downstream, but with additional influence from the stretching and residual terms, which are mainly associated with diabatic heating and frictional effects. The track deflection mechanism upstream and downstream is similar to the dry flow in previous study, but is very different {{in the vicinity of the}} mountain. When the TC landfalls near the northern (southern) tip, it experiences less (more) southward deflection due to stronger (weaker) <b>vorticity</b> <b>advection</b> around the tip. When the TC approaches the mountain range from the southeast and landfalls on the northern tip, center, or southern tip, the track deflections are similar to those embedded in an easterly flow but with weaker orographic blocking. These results are similar to the cases simulated in the dry flow in previous study, except that there is no track discontinuity due to the weaker orographic blocking associated with strong TC convection. When a TC moves along the north-south mountain range from the south, it tends to deflect toward the mountain and then crosses over to the other side at later time. In these cases, the positive VT is influenced by all horizontal <b>vorticity</b> <b>advection,</b> <b>vorticity</b> stretching (diabatic heating) and residual (friction) terms due to longer and stronger interaction with the mountain range.

The cyclonic circulation observed in the southern Adriatic area was partly sustained by the local wind forcing, as suggested by the positive correlation between the rate of change of the current vorticity and the wind-stress vorticity. Nevertheless, the influence of <b>vorticity</b> <b>advection</b> from the adjacent area (northern Ionian Sea) cannot be ignored and it is more significant during the anticyclonic phase of Adriatic–Ionian Bimodal Oscillation System.

40|$|This study investigates {{three types}} of {{atmospheric}} forcing across the summertime subtropics that are shown to contribute in various ways to the occurrence of dry and wet climates in the subtropics. To explain the formation of desert over the western parts of continents and monsoon over the eastern parts, we propose a new mechanism of positive feedback between diabatic heating and vorticity generation that occurs via meridional <b>advection</b> of planetary <b>vorticity</b> and temperature. Monsoon and desert are demonstrated to coexist as twin features of multi-scale forcing, as follows. First, continent-scale heating over land and cooling over ocean induce the ascent of air over the eastern parts of continents and western parts of oceans, and descent over eastern parts of oceans and western parts of continents. Second, local-scale sea-breeze forcing along coastal regions enhances air descent over eastern parts of oceans and ascent over eastern parts of continents. This leads {{to the formation of}} the well-defined summertime subtropical LOSECOD quadruplet-heating pattern across each continent and adjacent oceans, with long-wave radiative cooling (LO) over eastern parts of oceans, sensible heating (SE) over western parts of continents, condensation heating (CO) over eastern parts of continents, and double dominant heating (D: LO+CO) over western parts of oceans. Such a quadruplet heating pattern corresponds to a dry climate over the western parts of continents and a wet climate over eastern parts. Third, regional-scale orographic-uplift-heating generates poleward ascending flow to the east of orography and equatorward descending flow to the west. The Tibetan Plateau (TP) is located over the eastern Eurasian continent. The TP-forced circulation pattern is in phase with that produced by continental-scale forcing, and the strongest monsoon and largest deserts are formed over the Afro-Eurasian Continent. In contrast, the Rockies and the Andes are located over the western parts of their respective continents, and orography-induced ascent is separated from ascent due to continental-scale forcing. Accordingly, the deserts and monsoon climate over these continents are not as strongly developed as those over the Eurasian Continent. A new mechanism of positive feedback between diabatic heating and vorticity generation, which occurs via meridional transfer of heat and planetary vorticity, is proposed as a means of explaining the formation of subtropical desert and monsoon. Strong low-level longwave radiative cooling over eastern parts of oceans and strong surface sensible heating on western parts of continents generate negative vorticity that is balanced by <b>positive</b> planetary <b>vorticity</b> <b>advection</b> from high latitudes. The equatorward flow generated over eastern parts of oceans produces cold sea-surface temperature and stable stratification, leading in turn to the formation of low stratus clouds and the maintenance of strong in situ longwave radiative cooling. The equatorward flow over western parts of continents carries cold, dry air, thereby enhancing local sensible heating as well as moisture release from the underlying soil. These factors result in a dry desert climate. Over the eastern parts of continents, condensation heating generates <b>positive</b> <b>vorticity</b> in the lower troposphere, which is balanced by negative planetary <b>vorticity</b> <b>advection</b> of the meridional flow from low latitudes. The flow brings warm and moist air, thereby enhancing local convective instability and condensation heating associated with rainfall. These factors produce a wet monsoonal climate. Overall, our results demonstrate that subtropical desert and monsoon coexist as a consequence of multi-scale forcing along the subtropics...|$|R

Results reveal that the heavy-rain region of elevated MCSs is located on average about 160 km north of a quasi-stationary frontal zone, in a region of low-level moisture convergence that is elongated westward on the cool side of the boundary.

40|$|A three-dimensional, {{high-resolution}} {{numerical model}} {{is used to}} investigate processes and dynamics of an intensified upwelling that is induced by a coastal promontory over the East China Sea (ECS) shelf. The center of the intensified upwelling around the promontory has been constantly observed, but, so far, it has been dynamically unexplained. Forced by an idealized southeasterly wind stress, the model results well capture the observed upwelling at the lee of the coastal promontory. The intensified upwelling is formed by a strengthened shoreward transport downstream of the promontory as the upwelling jet veers shoreward. The jet is mainly controlled by a cross-shore geostrophic balance and is largely modulated by both centrifugal acceleration associated with nonlinear advection and by bottom stress. The strengthened shoreward transport is mainly attributed to the cross-shore geostrophic current that is induced by a countercurrent (negative) pressure gradient force (PGF) and partly attributed to the bottom Ekman transport. Based on the analyses of the momentum balance and depth-integrated vorticity dynamics, the authors provide a new explanation for the origin of negative PGF. It is found that the countercurrent PGF is generated by negative bottom stress curl and strengthened by negative vorticity advection downstream of the promontory. While the negative bottom stress curl arises from bottom shear vorticity, the source of negative advection downstream of the promontory is the negative shear vorticity on the seaside of the shoreward-bent jet. Nevertheless, cyclonic curvature vorticity {{at the bottom and}} <b>positive</b> <b>vorticity</b> <b>advection</b> in the water column at the promontory weakens the negative PGF.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} northward and northwestward {{propagation}} of 30 - 60 day oscillation over the western North Pacific (WNP) at upper and low levels with a three-dimensional streamfunction tendency equation. In the tropical WNP, the surface frictional effect {{associated with the}} cyclonic circulation enhances the low-level convergence at the cyclonic vorticity center to the northwest of the convection, causing the 30 - 60 day convection to develop northwestward. The <b>vorticity</b> <b>advection</b> induces the 30 - 60 day circulation at upper and low levels to propagate northwestward with a baroclinic structure. The combined effect of surface frictional-diabatic heating and <b>vorticity</b> <b>advection</b> causes the 30 - 60 day convection and circulation to develop and propagate simultaneously northwestward. After the convection fully develops, increased static stability associated with adiabatic cooling, reduced solar radiation due to the cloud-radiation effect, and negative land-surface feedbacks on moisture availability restrict any further development of the 30 - 60 day convection. A wave train emanating from the South China Sea/western North Pacific (SCS/WNP) into the extratropical North Pacific is well established 15 -days after the convection reached maximum intensity over the SCS/WNP. The main process and mechanisms responsible for the northwestward propagation of this 30 - 60 day oscillation in the extratropical WNP {{is similar to the}} process proposed for the tropical WNP except that in the mid-latitudes where the coriolis parameter becomes large, the influence of upper-level <b>vorticity</b> <b>advection</b> extends down to the low levels. ...|$|R
40|$|The role {{of static}} {{stability}} (sigma) is diagnosed for an intense extratropical cyclone that {{developed over the}} central United States during January 9 - 11, 1975. Results indicate that minimum sigma values occurred in the lower troposphere at 0000 UTC January 10, 1975, {{during the period of}} slow cyclone development, and then increased as rapid development proceeded. Further, the upward advection of smaller static stabilities in the cyclone area, a forcing process in the height tendency equation, resulted in a significant reduction of height falls attributed to <b>vorticity</b> <b>advection,</b> thermal advection, and latent heat release...|$|R
40|$|Two rapidly {{developing}} extratropical maritime cyclones (one, {{developed during}} January 13 - 15, 1979, along an intense frontal zone south of Japan, the other, of January 26 - 27, 1979, in a polar mass over the North Atlantic) were investigated using the FGGE data and ECMWF level IIIb analyses {{to describe the}} structure and dynamics of these events. Although the cyclones evolved from a strong low-level baroclinic zone without initial large midtropospheric <b>vorticity</b> <b>advection,</b> thus resembling the Petterssen type A development, rapid deepening occurred in both cases when an approaching upper tropospheric jet with appreciable shear <b>vorticity</b> <b>advection</b> became favorably superposed over the surface low. During the development period, stability decreased in the low troposphere, aiding in the rapid development of an intense mass-circulation and low tropospheric vorticity production by the divergence term. The results suggest that upper-level forcing plays {{a greater role in}} the initiation of explosive oceanic development than is suggested by the Petterssen and Smebye (1971) description...|$|R
