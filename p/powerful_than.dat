5|$|Ecuador {{is still}} at risk from earthquakes: Both intraplate (such as those in March 1987) and {{interplate}} earthquakes are possible. Intraplate seismicity poses a more formidable threat, {{as it can be}} much more <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> interplate seismicity and is usually associated with landslides, subsidence, and even soil liquefaction.|$|E
5|$|The city of Chengdu is {{the capital}} of Sichuan province, and it has sub-provincial {{administrative}} status. It contains 9 districts, 4 county-level cities, and 6 counties. The mayor is Ge Honglin, and the CPC Committee Secretary (who {{is considered to be}} more <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> the mayor) is Huang Xingchu.|$|E
5|$|After his {{appointment}} as project director {{for a new}} indigenous fighter program, Tank adapted the basic Ta 183 airframe for the Nene II engine, substantially resulting in a new design that bore only a passing resemblance to its forebear. The Nene was larger, heavier and more <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> the Heinkel HeS 011 turbojet that had been planned {{for use in the}} Ta 183, and therefore required a new, redesigned fuselage with a larger cross-section primarily due to the Nene's centrifugal rather than the HeS 011's axial compressor design.|$|E

5|$|All the bound {{protons and}} {{neutrons}} in an atom {{make up a}} tiny atomic nucleus, and are collectively called nucleons. The radius of a nucleus is approximately equal to 1.07fm, where A is {{the total number of}} nucleons. This is much smaller than the radius of the atom, which is on the order of 105fm. The nucleons are bound together by a short-ranged attractive potential called the residual strong force. At distances smaller than 2.5 fm this force is much more <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> the electrostatic force that causes positively charged protons to repel each other.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the rifle}} corps were re-established in late 1942 and the {{previous}} organization of artillery at the corps level was reintroduced. As {{a result of the}} halting of 152mm howitzer production, the Red Army corps artillery lacked a weapon more mobile than the heavy 152 mm howitzer-gun M1937 (ML-20) (typically employed by army-level and Reserve of the Main Command artillery units), but more <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> the 122 mm howitzer M1938 (M-30).|$|E
5|$|In 1933, the Pennsylvania Railroad {{decided to}} replace the P5, and {{instructed}} General Electric and Westinghouse to design an electric locomotive that was more <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> the P5, capable of speeds of , have a lighter axle load and to be double-ended with a cab {{in the center of}} the carbody. Westinghouse designed the R1 #4800, and General Electric submitted the GG1, then numbered 4899.|$|E

5|$|In {{the battles}} of Modrica and Meçad 7,000 Ottoman forces were left {{dead on the}} {{battlefield}} along with thousands of horses. The Albanians had suffered 1,000 casualties themselves and, in their exhaustion, they refused to pursue the fleeing Ottoman forces. Hamza Pasha and his staff were ransomed to the sultan. Raimon d'Ortafà reported Skanderbeg's victory to Alfonso who received it with great exuberance. Skanderbeg's victory over a ruler even more <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> Murad came as a great surprise to the Albanians. Skanderbeg's reputation among his allies was redeemed and the Dukagjini opted for a reconciliation.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of the convention, Mason {{supported}} much of the Virginia Plan, which was introduced by Randolph on May 29. This plan would have a popularly elected lower house which would choose the members of the upper house from lists provided by the states. Most of the delegates had found the weak government under the Articles insufficient, and Randolph proposed that the new federal government should be supreme over the states. Mason agreed that the federal government should be more <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> the states.|$|E
5|$|NASA {{managers}} and engineers declared the mission a complete success. The completion {{of all the}} major objectives, {{as well as some}} that were not considered vital, upgraded the Hubble telescope to its most technologically advanced state since its launch nineteen years before and made it more <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> ever. The upgrades will help Hubble to see deeper into the universe and farther into the past, closer to the time of the Big Bang.|$|E

50|$|The HS-393 was a <b>powerful</b> {{platform}} <b>than</b> the HS-376 platform, {{being able}} to supply 2,200kW of power versus 1,400 of the HS-376HP. But only three were ever built.|$|R
50|$|Maersk's Triple E {{class of}} ships was {{designed}} for slow steaming, with hulls optimized for lower speeds. Because of this, it has less <b>powerful</b> engines <b>than</b> its predecessors.|$|R
5|$|Terraforming is {{a natural}} {{outgrowth}} of colonizing an alien world. The first playable prototype was just a map generator that tested climate changes during the game. This required the designers to create a world builder program and climatic model far more <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> anything they'd done before. Temperature, wind, and rainfall patterns were modeled in ways that allow players to make changes: for example, creating a ridge-line and then watching the effects. In addition to raising terrain, the player can also divert rivers, dig huge boreholes into the planet's mantle, and melt ice caps.|$|E
5|$|The Action of 26 April 1797 {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} {{during the}} French Revolutionary Wars in which a Spanish convoy of two frigates was trapped and defeated off the Spanish town of Conil de la Frontera by British ships of the Cadiz blockade. The British vessels, the ship of the line HMS Irresistible and the Fifth-rate frigate HMS Emerald, were significantly more <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> the Spanish frigates, which were on the last stage of a voyage carrying treasure from Havana, Cuba, to the Spanish fleet base of Cadiz.|$|E
5|$|The Alaskas were officially {{funded in}} September 1940 {{along with a}} plethora of other ships {{as a part of}} the Two-Ocean Navy Act. Their role had been altered slightly: in {{addition}} to their surface-to-surface role, they were planned to protect carrier groups. Because of their bigger guns, greater size and increased speed, they would be more valuable in this role than heavy cruisers, and would provide insurance against reports that Japan was building super cruisers more <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> U.S. heavy cruisers.|$|E

50|$|HobbyZone {{introduced}} {{their first}} scale model in 2006. The three-channel, 480-powered Super Cub RTF incorporates ACT technology for novice pilots in a larger, more <b>powerful</b> package <b>than</b> ParkZone's intermediate J-3 Cub.|$|R
5|$|The first {{indication}} {{of a change in}} weather was the sudden collapse of the market for specialized AI hardware in 1987. Desktop computers from Apple and IBM had been steadily gaining speed and power and in 1987 they became more <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> the more expensive Lisp machines made by Symbolics and others. There was no longer a good reason to buy them. An entire industry worth half a billion dollars was demolished overnight.|$|E
5|$|The {{position}} of governor has {{developed over the}} course of two centuries. It has become considerably more powerful since the mid-20th century after decades of struggle with the Indiana General Assembly and Indiana Supreme Court to establish the executive branch of the government as an equal third branch of the state government. Although gubernatorial powers were again significantly expanded by constitutional amendments during the 1970s, Indiana governors remain significantly less <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> their counterparts in most other states.|$|E
5|$|Truman's second inauguration was {{the first}} ever {{televised}} nationally. His second term was grueling as his opponents controlled Congress and his policy of rollback in Korea failed. The Soviet Union's atomic bomb project progressed much faster than had been expected and they detonated their first bomb on August 29, 1949. In response, on January 7, 1953, Truman announced the detonation of the first U.S. hydrogen bomb, which was much more <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> the Soviets' atomic weapons.|$|E

5|$|Units can now level up in battle, {{increasing}} their capabilities. Units increase their level once for each enemy unit that they destroy. The level of each unit {{is identified as}} I, II, or Vet, with Vet being the highest level. While units with higher levels are more <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> new units, the power increase is slight. Unit experience is not persistent, and the player begins each mission with new units.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{the revelation}} of the character's new design as a cyborg ninja, writers noted how Raiden distanced himself from his {{previous}} appearance that imitated Solid Snake. They also emphasized how Raiden becomes {{a different type of}} game hero with a new, direct fighting style. Since Raiden has become more <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> Solid Snake in physical strength and weaponry to the point of exaggeration, writers have compared him favorably to other popular game heroes and find his actions still in-character considering the fight scenes throughout the series.|$|E
5|$|While other bats {{have almost}} {{lost the ability}} to {{maneuver}} on land, vampire bats can walk, jump, and even run by using a unique, bounding gait, in which the forelimbs instead of the hindlimbs are recruited for force production, as the wings are much more <b>powerful</b> <b>than</b> the legs. This ability to run seems to have evolved independently within the bat lineage.|$|E
