The ball mill process to make the <b>plate-like</b> <b>particles</b> is called a solid-state powder processing technique which involves repeated welding, fracturing and re-welding of powder particles in a high-energy ball mill. The effect of ball milling process on the magnetic behavior of CI particles is firstly investigated by vibrating sample magnetometer.

40|$|Abstract. Small-angle neutron {{scattering}} (SANS) measurements of low concentration, single crystal Nb–D alloys {{have been performed}} to characterize the effect of deformation on deuteride phase formation. The SANS response from the deuteride phase formed at low temperature in the undeformed matrix was consistent with a spherical particle morphology, as expected from {{a large body of}} published TEM studies. In addition, a significant hysteresis was observed (1 T 100) in the SANS response versus temperature from the undeformed sample material. The hysteresis is attributed to the irreversible plastic deformation required to nucleate the incoherent phase. Deformation produced by unidirectional rolling to 50 % thickness reduction altered the deuteride phase transformation characteristics in a fundamental way. The SANS response was highly anisotropic, indicative of an oriented, anisometric particle morphology. Metallographic analysis of deformed specimens electropolished below the solvus temperature confirmed the presence of large deuteride plates with an orientation consistent with the anisotropic SANS response. Deformation also eliminated the temperature hysteresis observed in the undeformed material. A cellular dislocation substructure was found in TEM characterization of the deformed Nb single crystal material. The <b>plate-like</b> <b>particle</b> morphology in the deformed material is attributed to an interaction between the precipitating deuterium and the cellular dislocation substructure. The elimination of the temperature hysteresis is consistent with an interaction between the deuterium and regions of high dislocation density facilitating heterogeneous nucleation. 1...|$|R

A novel synthesis route to prepare magnetorheological fluid (MRF) using two different sizes of <b>plate-like</b> iron <b>particles</b> is described in detail. Two different kinds of MRF are then prepared and their rheological properties are presented and discussed extensively. Steady shear flow and small amplitude dynamic oscillatory measurements are carried out in the presence of magnetic field. This experimental study reveals and highlights the importance of exploiting some parameters such as magnetic field strength, effect of particle size, magneto-viscous and visco-elastic properties of the suspending fluid. The magnetization of the fluids is also performed to explain the effect of particle size in the magnetic field which is directly correlated with the yield stress. In the absence of magnetic field, the properties of fluid are isotropic and upon the application of magnetic field the magnetized particles form a strong-chain like structures in the field direction which promotes the appearance of yield stress.

40|$|In deep-sea sediments, contourites {{deposited}} {{from bottom}} currents mainly along slopes {{are associated with}} hemipelagites, pelagites, and sediment gravity-flow deposits. The major sedimentary facies of contourites are characterized by bioturbation and mottling and bigradational grading. However, {{it is difficult to}} discriminate muddy contourites from hemipelagites by using only these features of the lithofacies, particularly in core samples. Therefore, the present study focused on microstructure as an additional potentially diagnostic characteristic for identifying muddy contourites. Microstructures of muddy contourites, mainly from the Gulf of Cádiz, and of hemipelagites from off the West Iberian margin collected by IODP Expedition 339 were examined, along with their magnetic fabric and grain-size distribution. The results showed that the muddy contourites were composed mainly of silt grains, including <b>plate-like</b> silt <b>particles</b> that were oriented parallel or sub-parallel to the bedding plane. Some samples were composed of silt grains up to 100 µm in apparent size. In contrast, the hemipelagites were composed of calcareous nannoplankton or silt grains and randomly oriented clay particles. The magnetic fabric, as indicated by the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility, and the grain-size distribution of the muddy contourites also differed from those of hemipelagite. On the basis of these features, the <b>plate-like</b> silt <b>particles</b> parallel or sub-parallel to the bedding plane characterizing the muddy contourites were interpreted to reflect rapid deposition from a low-concentration suspension of fine-grained particles in a weak bottom current.

The Fe, Ca, Mg, Na, and Si concentrations, pH, and electrical conductivity of the solutions increased after dispersant addition, X s, and/or the solids volume fraction, φ{symbol}, was raised. Electrophoretic mobility, negative for all studied dispersions, became more negative after dispersant addition and less negative with increasing solids fraction. The dispersions with X s ≤ 0. 075 mg dispersant/m 2 displayed plastic behaviour (in the shear flow test) and exhibited the characteristics of a gel (in the oscillatory test), owing to the extensive aggregation of the kaolinite particles. The dispersions with X s ≥ 0. 105 mg dispersant/m 2 displayed shear-thinning behaviour (in the shear flow test) and viscoelastic fluid characteristics (in the oscillatory test). This behaviour is typical of dense dispersions of plate-shaped colloidal particles, which are well stabilised by electrostatic repulsion. The rheological properties of well-stabilised dispersions were analysed and readily interpreted by redefining the kaolin platelets as new effective hard particles, the thickness of the <b>plate-like</b> <b>particle</b> with its ionic double layer being considered as effective thickness. This enabled an effective volume fraction to be calculated that describes the combined effect of the solids volume fraction and the dispersant addition on dispersion rheological properties.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{we aim to}} provide a many-sided answer to the question: what are the {{consequences}} of plate-like colloidal shape on a suspensions' physical properties? A central role in this investigation is played by the experimental model system of platelets which, building on the Van 't Hoff Laboratory's rich tradition with respect to synthesizing colloidal model systems, was developed for this purpose. Consisting of fairly monodisperse sterically stabilised gibbsite platelets, this system allows us to focus on the effect of <b>plate-like</b> <b>particle</b> shape while keeping the shape, size and interactions well-defined. In part I, we consider the dynamical properties of dilute suspensions. This yields the first results for the viscosity, sedimentation, and diffusion behaviour of such a platelet suspension {{as a function of the}} volume fraction. It will be interesting to see whether these experiments will inspire theoretical efforts towards calculating the f-coefficients in the viscosity, sedimentation, and diffusion, for which no predictions are yet available. In part II, we show that these suspensions of approximately hard platelets exhibit an isotropic to nematic phase transition. While being predicted by the Onsager theory and computer simulations, this observation clearly contrasts with the ubiquitous (but poorly understood) gel formation in suspensions of clay platelets. Furthermore, increasing the platelets' polydispersity leads to a broadening of the I-N coexistence region and the appearance of pronounced fractionation. We demonstrate that a remarkable feature of the observed I-N transition in these more polydisperse systems -where the nematic phase becomes the upper phase- can be explained on the basis of strong fractionation with respect to platelet thickness. Moreover, at high particle densities, the suspensions exhibit a nematic to columnar phase transition. Although predicted by simulations for monodisperse platelets, the stability of a columnar phase in suspensions with up to 25...|$|R

40|$|The {{large number}} of {{intersecting}} surfaces in a volume divides the latter into small sub-volumes. Each of the sub-volumes is outlined or nearly outlined by parts of the intersecting surfaces. A number of simple geometrical conditions to be imposed on the intersecting surfaces determine a certain size distribution of the outlined sub-volumes. The approach based on these prerequisites was previously successfully applied to the multiple cracking and fragmentation of rocks, naturally and by blasting, {{as well as to}} soil fragmentation by shrinkage cracks. In both cases the intersecting surfaces are cracks, and sub-volumes are rock or soil fragments. The first application of the approach to the pore structure of soils was related to modelling the clay matrix pores and their size distribution. In this case the <b>plate-like</b> clay <b>particles</b> play the part of the intersecting surfaces, and the pore volumes play the part of the sub-volumes. The approach leads to the scale-invariant fragment- and pore-size distributions and permits one {{to take into account the}} superposition of the intersecting surfaces of a different physical nature and scale, the connectedness and tortuosity of the intersecting surfaces, the shape characteristics of sub-volumes, and the swelling-shrinkage of a system of clay particles. In general, soils contain, besides clay matrix pores, such sub-volumes as silt-sand grains and different types of clay aggregates and pores. The boundaries of the silt-sand grains and aggregates, along with cracks and clay particles, play the part of the intersecting surfaces. The objective of this work is to generalize the approach to model the different size distributions in sand and aggregated soil (in the last case we only consider the interaggregate, ie structural porosity). This development follows a brief summary of the approach including its previous applications as well as a consideration of the differences between such inter- secting surfaces as cracks, <b>plate-like</b> clay <b>particles,</b> boundaries of sand grains and aggregates.

The most distinctive feature of the new species is that the test is contained within an agglutinated case (‘secondary test’) composed mainly of larger (10 – 50 ?m) quartz grains. The case {{is equipped with a}} long, narrow tube that originates near the aperture of the inner test and presumably acts as a channel through which pseudopodia are deployed. Secondary agglutinated structures have been described in a number of foraminifera, but never before in a ‘saccamminid’...|$|R
