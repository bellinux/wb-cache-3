5|$|In 1955 the Howitt {{report on}} the {{development}} of <b>pig</b> production in the United Kingdom was published. Its main conclusions were that UK <b>pig</b> farms were poorly placed to compete with European producers, that the diversity of local breeds in the UK was an obstacle to progress, and that British <b>pig</b> farmers should focus on three breeds only: the Welsh, the British Landrace, and the Large White. The report initiated a period of decline in all other British <b>pig</b> breeds, including the Large Black. By the time the Rare Breeds Survival Trust was founded 1973, numbers of all traditional <b>pig</b> breeds were dangerously low, and many of them were extinct. The Large Black was placed on the Trust's endangered list.|$|E

5|$|Commercially {{available}} iron {{is classified}} based on purity and {{the abundance of}} additives. <b>Pig</b> iron has 3.5–4.5% carbon and contains varying amounts of contaminants such as sulfur, silicon and phosphorus. <b>Pig</b> iron is not a saleable product, but rather an intermediate step {{in the production of}} cast iron and steel. The reduction of contaminants in <b>pig</b> iron that negatively affect material properties, such as sulfur and phosphorus, yields cast iron containing 2–4% carbon, 1–6% silicon, and small amounts of manganese. <b>Pig</b> iron has a melting point in the range of 1420–1470K, which is lower than either of its two main components, and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together.

40|$|Abstract Background Currently, larger {{domestic}} <b>pigs</b> {{are only}} animals {{widely used in}} vaccine evaluation and pathogenicity study of classical swine fever virus (CSFV). This study was aimed to create an alternative animal experimental infection model of CSFV. Results Twenty specific-pathogen-free Bama miniature <b>pigs</b> were randomly {{divided into two groups}} and rooms, infected and non-infected, and the <b>pigs</b> in the infected group were inoculated intramuscularly with 10 4, 10 5 or 10 6 TCID 50 (median tissue culture infective dose) CSFV Shimen strain (n = 5 × 3) or left uninoculated to serve as in-contact <b>pigs</b> (n = 3). The uninfected control <b>pigs</b> (n = 2) were housed in a separate room. Clinical signs, body temperature, viraemia, tissue antigen distribution, pathological changes and seroconversion were monitored. Clinical signs were observed as early as 2 days post-inoculation (dpi) in all infected <b>pigs</b> (though mild in contact <b>pigs),</b> but not non-infected control <b>pigs.</b> All inoculated <b>pigs</b> showed viraemia by 6 dpi.
