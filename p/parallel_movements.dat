Then, there is the distortion of the young man—I had called this elementary parallelism. It was a formal decomposition; that is, linear elements following each other like parallels and distorting the object. The object is completely stretched out, as if elastic. The lines follow each other in parallels, while changing subtly to form the movement, or the form of the young man in question. I also used this procedure in the Nude Descending a Staircase.|$|E
2500|$|Everybody was {{influenced}} {{at the time}} by Arturo Toscanini - {{it was easy to}} understand {{what he was trying to}} do: you didn't need any reference to spiritual dimension. There was a certain order in the way the music was presented. With Toscanini I never felt anything spiritual. With Furtwängler on the other hand, I understood that there I was confronted by something completely different: metaphysics, transcendence, the relationship between sounds and sonorities [...] Furtwängler was not only a musician, he was a creator [...] What happens to those who don't understand the manifold variety of musical performance? Who are unable to hear that famous astral octave because they are deaf to music? Then their integration is related only to a part of a musical score, to the least important one, the raw material. But that's precisely what music is not about [...] Then you find each tempo too slow. Because the slowness or fastness are determined by the complexity of these musical manifestations. Furtwängler had the ear for it: not the physical ear, but the spiritual ear that captures these <b>parallel</b> <b>movements.</b>|$|E
2500|$|There emerged two <b>parallel</b> <b>movements</b> of modernization. The {{first was}} the Đông Du ("Go East") Movement started in 1905 by Phan Bội Châu. Châu's plan was to send Vietnamese {{students}} to Japan to learn modern skills, {{so that in the}} future they could lead a successful armed revolt against the French. With Prince Cường Để, he started two organizations in Japan: Duy Tân Hội and Việt Nam Công Hiến Hội. Due to French diplomatic pressure, Japan later deported Châu. Phan Châu Trinh, who favored a peaceful, non-violent struggle to gain independence, led a second movement, Duy Tân (Modernization), which stressed education for the masses, modernizing the country, fostering understanding and tolerance between the French and the Vietnamese, and peaceful transitions of power. The early part of the 20th century saw the growing in status of the Romanized Quốc Ngữ alphabet for the Vietnamese language. Vietnamese patriots realized the potential of Quốc Ngữ as a useful tool to quickly reduce illiteracy and to educate the masses. The traditional Chinese scripts or the Nôm script were seen as too cumbersome and too difficult to learn. The use of prose in literature also became popular with the appearance of many novels; most famous were those from the Tự Lực Văn Đoàn literary circle.|$|E

2500|$|Futurism (...) was {{an artistic}} and social {{movement}} that originated in Italy {{in the early}} 20th century. It emphasized speed, technology, youth, and violence, and objects such as the car, the aeroplane, and the industrial city. Although it was largely an Italian phenomenon, there were <b>parallel</b> <b>movements</b> in Russia, England, Belgium and elsewhere. The Futurists practiced in every medium of art, including painting, sculpture, ceramics, graphic design, industrial design, interior design, urban design, theatre, film, fashion, textiles, literature, music, architecture, and even Futurist meals. Its key figures were the Italians Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carrà, Gino Severini, Giacomo Balla, Antonio Sant'Elia, Bruno Munari, Benedetta Cappa and Luigi Russolo, the Russians Natalia Goncharova, Velimir Khlebnikov, Igor Severyanin, David Burliuk, Aleksei Kruchenykh and Vladimir Mayakovsky, the Belgian Jules Schmalzigaug and the Portuguese Almada Negreiros. It glorified modernity and aimed to liberate Italy from the weight of its past. Cubism contributed {{to the formation of}} Italian Futurism's artistic style. Important Futurist works included Marinetti's Manifesto of Futurism, Boccioni's sculpture Unique Forms of Continuity in Space, and Balla's painting Abstract Speed + Sound (pictured). To some extent Futurism influenced the art movements Art Deco, Constructivism, Surrealism, Dada, and to a greater degree Precisionism, Rayonism, and Vorticism.|$|E

40|$|Collective {{behaviour}} research {{focuses on}} behaviour properties of large groups of similar entities. The most studied collective behaviour species are ocks of birds and schools of �sh. There exist many di�erent computational models of collective behaviour, which researchers used to investigate various properties of collective behaviour like: transfer of information across the group, bene�ts of grouping (defence against predator, foraging),group decisionmaking process and group behaviour types. In this thesis we focused on various group behaviour types, transitions between them and their bene�ts when the prey group is exposed to predator attacks. In our study we implemented the collective behaviour computational model originally presented by Couzin et al. [doi: 10. 1006 /jtbi. 2002. 3065], who discovered four di�erent be-haviour types by adjusting the radius of the orientation zone: swarming, rotating around an empty core, dynamic <b>parallel</b> <b>movement</b> and highly <b>parallel</b> <b>movement.</b> Swarming is typical for insects, rotating around an empty core (torus) is in special cases exhibited by sh schools and dynamic/highly <b>parallel</b> <b>movement</b> is primary associated with bird ocks and �sh schools. With known behaviour types and using various attack tactics we tried to verify which behaviour type is the most e�cient defence against predator attacks, and whether transitions between these behaviour types contribute to a more e�cient defence...|$|R

A finished embossment will be satin-white in color and will contrast with the translucency of the parchment paper. Color can be varied by moderating the level to which the shape is embossed.

50|$|As {{birth control}} became widely accessible, {{men and women}} began to have more {{choice in the matter}} of having {{children}} than ever before. The 1916 invention of thin, disposable latex condoms for men led to widespread affordable condoms by the 1930s; the demise of the Comstock laws in 1936 set the stage for promotion of available effective contraceptives such as the diaphragm and cervical cap; the 1960s introduction of the IUD and oral contraceptives for women gave a sense of freedom from barrier contraception. The opposition of Churches (e.g. Humanae vitae) led to <b>parallel</b> <b>movements</b> of secularization and exile from religion. Women gained much greater access to birth control in the “girls world” decision in 1965, in the 1960s and 1970s the birth control movement advocated for the legalization of abortion and large scale education campaigns about contraception by governments.|$|E

50|$|<b>Parallel</b> <b>movements</b> in Russia were Suprematism, where Kasimir Malevich {{also created}} non-representational work, notably a black canvas. The Jack of Diamonds group with Mikhail Larionov was expressionist in nature.Dadaism preceded Surrealism, where the {{theories}} of Freudian psychology led to the depiction of the dream and the unconscious in art in work by Salvador Dalí. Kandinsky's introduction of non-representational art preceded the 1950s American Abstract Expressionist school, including Jackson Pollock, who dripped paint onto the canvas, and Mark Rothko, who created large areas of flat colour. Detachment {{from the world of}} imagery was reversed in the 1960s by the Pop Art movement, notably Andy Warhol, where brash commercial imagery became a Fine Art staple. Warhol also minimised the role of the artist, often employing assistants to make his work and using mechanical means of production, such as silkscreen printing. This marked a change from Modernism to Post-Modernism. Photorealism evolved from Pop Art and as a counter to Abstract Expressionists.|$|E
