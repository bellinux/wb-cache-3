There had been not only an influential pre-war migration of European architects to Queensland - <b>professionals</b> <b>like</b> Karl Langer who occupied a role with the railways from 1939 until 1946 - but also a post-war flow of architects from Britain and Europe who came to Queensland in search of work and brought with them the architectural ideas and training that were driving forward the large task of post-war reconstruction and housing provision being undertaken in their countries of origin.|$|E
25|$|In the United States {{today there}} are two major {{national}} sanctioning bodies for BMX racing. One is the National Bicycle League (NBL), a nonprofit organization started in 1974 by George Edward Esser (September 17, 1925 – August 31, 2006). It was originally based in Pompano Beach, Florida, in the US, but now its headquarters is located in Hilliard, Ohio. George Esser was exposed to BMX by his son Greg Esser, who was famous within the sport and one of the sport's earliest superstars and first <b>professionals.</b> <b>Like</b> Ernie Alexander and Scot Breithaupt before him, he was a promoter who created the NBL as the BMX auxiliary to the National Motorcycle League (NML), now-defunct, when he became dissatisfied with how the races were run.|$|E
25|$|Yorkshire at {{this time}} was {{in a period of}} transition. They had won the {{championship}} four times between 1922 and 1925 but had since then been overshadowed by their great rivals Lancashire who had won the title in each of the preceding three seasons. In 1929, Yorkshire and Lancashire tied on points as runners-up, the title going to Nottinghamshire. Yorkshire's team relied on the experience and leadership of the veterans Rhodes and Robinson and on the expertise of established <b>professionals</b> <b>like</b> Sutcliffe, his opening partner Percy Holmes, Leyland and bowler George Macaulay. Otherwise, the team consisted of up and coming players who were effectively on trial and there was competition for places. Bowes, for example, had Frank Dennis as his main rival for the role of pace bowler. Other aspiring players active in 1929 were Wilf Barber, Horace Fisher, Arthur Wood and Cyril Turner while Arthur Mitchell had gained his county cap the previous year. Waiting in the wings, however, was Hedley Verity who was then playing in the Lancashire League and made his Yorkshire debut in 1930.|$|E

25|$|To {{boost their}} chances of winning wagers, some patrons formed their own county-class teams such as the Kent and Sussex teams led by Stead and the 2nd Duke of Richmond in the 1720s. As players themselves, they captained their teams and it was gentlemen like them, and the friends whom they invited to play, who {{established}} cricket's amateur tradition. Professionals were paid a match fee for taking part. Thus, a Sussex team of the 1720s might be captained by Richmond and include not only additional gentlemen like his fellow patron Gage but also <b>professionals</b> <b>like</b> Thomas Waymark. That was the pattern of first-class English teams until 1962. Waymark, for example, was employed by the Duke of Richmond as a groom and this became a common arrangement between patron and professional in the 18th century. In later years, Lumpy Stevens and John Minshull were employed by their patrons as a gardener and gamekeeper respectively. In the longer term, however, the professional became an employee of his club and the beginnings of this trend could be observed in the 1770s when the Hambledon Club paid match fees to its players.|$|E

McManaman was also twice voted as the Real Madrid supporters' favourite player at the club during his tenure, who adored him for his workrate, and where the Spanish media would rave about him regarding anything from his love of the Madrid lifestyle, his willingness to learn the language and immerse into their culture, to his home in La Moraleja, or even his androgynous [...] to Hollywood actress Nicole Kidman, all of which, curiously resulted in bolstering his [...] "affable and amiable" [...] image as the darling of the team at that time.

6000|$|In this town, {{facing the}} sea, is a street lined with quaint houses painted in yellows and browns and greens, and under each house {{the kind of}} a shop that brings back to the middleaged delectable {{memories}} of extreme youth and nickels to spend. Up and down that street on a bright Saturday afternoon may be seen our Middle-Western jackies chumming with the British sailors and Tommies, or flirting with the Irish girls, or gazing through the little panes of the show-windows, whose enterprising proprietors have imported from the States a popular brand of chewing-gum to make us feel more at home. In one of these shops, where I went to choose a picture post-card, I caught sight of an artistic display of a delicacy I had thought long obsolete--the everlasting gum-drop. But when I produced a shilling the shopkeeper shook his head. [...] "Sure, every day the sailors are wanting to buy them of me, but it's for ornament I'm keeping them," [...] he said. [...] "There's no more to be had till the war will be over. Eight years they're here now, and you wouldn't get a tooth in them, sir!" [...] So I wandered out again, joined the admiral, and inspected the Bluejackets' Club by the water's edge. Nothing one sees, perhaps, is so eloquent of the change that has taken place in the life and fabric of our navy.

A band of thirty pieces furnished the music, and in the opinion of the jackies one feature alone was lacking to make the entertainment a complete success--the new drop-curtain had failed to arrive from London. I happened to be present when this curtain was first unrolled, and beheld spread out before me a most realistic presentation of [...] "little old New York," [...] seen from the North River, towering against blue American skies.
