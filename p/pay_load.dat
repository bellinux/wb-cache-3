Today, the detection of XSS worm has been largely UN explored. This paper proposes the first purely client-side solution to detect XSS worms.

40|$|Casual {{status is}} {{commonly}} understood {{to exclude the}} entitlements associated with ongoing employment relationships. In Australia, however, the definition of casual employment has never been precise, and {{a high proportion of}} ‘casual’ positions are, in effect, regular forms of employment. Recent strategies to improve working conditions have thus sought to move beyond the typical Australian approach of applying a <b>pay</b> <b>loading</b> to compensate (partially) for lack of entitlements, towards attempts to extend some of the benefits of permanent status to more regular forms of casual employment. In this paper we examine two recent cases in Queensland that exemplify these contrasting strategies, highlighting the essential conflict between them, and the way it is compounded by the imprecise delineation of casuals in the Australian system. We note that both strategies are limited by the industrial relations context in which they are situated, and that additional entitlements may not be readily accessible in practice. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a family of}} innovative fixed wing UAS with can vertical take off and land – the SONGBIRD family. With nominal payloads starting from 0. 5 kg they can take off and land safely like a multi-rotor UAV, removing {{the need for an}} airstrip for the critical phases of operation. A specially designed flight controller allows stable flight at every point of the transition phase between VTOL and fixed wing mode. Because of this smooth process with a all time stable flight, very expensive payload like hyperspectral sensors or advanced optical cameras can be used. Due to their design all airplanes of the SONGBIRD family have excellent horizontal flight properties, a maximum speed of over 110 km/h, good gliding properties and long flight times of up to 1 h. Missions were flown in wind speeds up to 18 m/s. At every time of the flight it is possible to interrupt the mission and hover over a point of interest for detail investigations. The complete flight, including take-off and landing can be performed by autopilot. Designed for daily use in professional environments, SONGBIRDs are built out of glass-fibre and carbon composites for a long service life. For safe operations comprehensive security features are implemented, for example redundant flight controllers and sensors, advanced power management system and mature fail safe procedures.

Both the formulation variables studied exerted a significant influence (p < 0. 05) on the drug release whereas the total polymer levels emerged as a lone factor significantly influencing the percent drug incorporation. Numerical optimization technique employing desirability approach was used to develop a new formulation by setting constraints on the dependent and independent variables.

Two variations of the cycle were considered. The split flow cycle bleeds high temperature, high pressure air from the gas generator directly to the free turbine in the wing. The through flow cycle partially expands the high temperature, high pressure air through the compressor turbine of the gas generator then directs the compressor-turbine exhaust air to the free turbine in the wing. Design parameters of pressure ratio, radiator depth, radiation flow density, and hot gas duct size were optimized to give minimum weight per shaft horsepower of the complete power plant. The weight of a split flow power plant capable of supplying 22, 000 shaft horsepower {{was found to be}} 116, 600 pounds. The weight of a similar through flow power plant was found to be 119, 900 pounds. The reactor power required in both cases was 70 megawatts.
