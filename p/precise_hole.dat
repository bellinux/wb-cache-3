40|$|The {{interaction}} of femtosecond and nanosecond laser pulses with {{the surface of}} glass was compared. The glass was placed inside a vacuum chamber. The laser pulses were focused on the glass surface. The morphology of irradiated glass surfaces and of the materials ejected from the surfaces was examined by scanning electron and optical microscopy. During femtosecond laser irradiation, molten material was ejected from the interaction zone on the glass surface. Nanosecond laser pulses (15 mJ/pulse) induced cracks {{on the surface of}} glass, whereas the laser with an energy of 8 mJ/ pulse removed a thin layer from the surface through the sputtering process. In the former case, pieces of glass were ejected from the interaction zone, whereas spherical fine powder was produced in the latter case. The femtosecond laser can significantly localize the damage zone. Interference fringes similar to liquid waves were generated on the surface. This indicates that the glass was melted locally by the femtosecond laser irradiation. Shock waves generated by the nanosecond laser (15 mJ/pulse) caused cracks in the glass.

40|$|The {{importance}} of Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) process is increasing, {{especially for the}} machining of electric conductive ceramic materials {{within the field of}} micro production technology.

30|$|Overall, {{this paper}} {{suggests}} {{new directions for}} the study of co-occurrences by focusing on their higher-order properties and there is substantial space for further development. The first and most urgent point, in our opinion, regards the necessity to validate the findings from the data by having well-founded null models for comparison. Recently some null models for simplicial complexes have been developed (Young et al. 2017; Courtney and Bianconi 2016), which we did not use here for computational reasons, as producing samples from our relatively large dataset proved too challenging to manage with our resources. Another very important point is to devise methods and find algorithms to localise homological holes with precision, as this could be very useful for some specific applications, and it can still be considered an open problem. In this regard we {{think that it would be}} pivotal to unify the study of the geometry and the topology of the structure. A geometrical approach has been used in (Eckmann and Moses 2002) where they find that curvature is a good measure of thematic cohesion in the WWW. More recently (Wu et al. 2015; Bianconi and Rahmede 2017) studied the emergence of geometry in growing simplicial complexes, without a pre-existing embedding space and metric. This approach could be naturally extended to our case, as we have no natural embedding space for concepts, and also because the co-occurrence simplicial complex that we study is dynamic by nature, as new simplices appear at each time step eventually glueing to existing simplices. Embedding concepts in a space could facilitate the localisation of holes, in this regard (Bianconi and Rahmede 2017) find that the natural embedding for their growing simplicial complexes is hyperbolic, and in their case the position of the incoming nodes depends on the position of the nodes of the face of the simplex to which the new simplex glues. Such a framework could be ideal to the purpose of <b>precise</b> <b>holes</b> identification in our case. Moreover adopting a growing simplicial complex model (generalized to allow for simplices of different size at each time step) and fitting it to our data we could be able to predict the future evolution of the conceptual space of mathematics.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} developing novel Contact-State (CS) modeling, control strategy, {{and environment}} position localization (position searching) for force-guided robotic assembly processes of rigid and flexible objects. For the CS modeling, the wrench (Cartesian force and torque) signals of the manipulated object are captured for different {{phases of the}} considered assembly processes and using the Expectation Maximization-based Gaussian Mixtures Model (EM-GMM), a recognizer is developed for each CS of the assembly. The suggested EM-GMM CS modeling scheme is shown to have excellent Classification Success Rate (CSR) with reduced computational efforts. For the control part, it is shown throughout the thesis that a force-guided robotic assembly process is a hybrid nonlinear system with arbitrary switching signal resulted from the constraints arbitrary switching during the assembly. Furthermore, the robot dynamics is frequently unknown, which {{is the case in}} many industrial robots, that would make the force-guided robotic assembly process to be an unknown hybrid nonlinear system with arbitrary switching. In order to overcome such a control challenge, a Decentralized Robust Adaptive Fuzzy Control (DRAFC) strategy is derived that guarantees stable performance under constraints arbitrary switching and unknown dynamics. For the environment position localization, the EM-GMM CS modeling scheme is integrated with a spiral search path and the <b>precise</b> <b>hole</b> position is identified for cases of position uncertainty. Experiments are conducted on a KUKA Lightweight Robot (LWR) doing different force-guided assembly tasks for rigid and flexible objects. Excellent performance is reported for the proposed EM-GMM CS recognition scheme, the DRAFC strategy, and the suggested position searching algorithm. The suggested EM-GMM CS recognition, DRAFC strategy, and position localization schemes are compared with the availably corresponding schemes and the superiority of the suggested schemes is shown. The reasons behind the superiority of the EM-GMM CS recognition scheme are the accommodation of the captured signals non-stationary behavior, employing optimized number of GMM components in the modeling process, and employing the EM algorithm that iteratively increases the log-likelihood. The causes behind the superiority of the DRAFC strategy are addressing the unknown nonlinear dynamics of the robot, accommodating the constraints arbitrary switching, and the robustness against possible dynamics parameters drift. The reasons behind the surpassing of the suggested position localization strategy are the robustness against the surface roughness and reduced computational efforts. The proposed EM-GMM CS modeling scheme, DRAFC strategy, and position searching scheme are applied to the entire peg-in-hole assembly processes of rigid and flexible objects. Excellent Localization Success Rate (LSR) was resulted when using the suggested schemes. Furthermore, the proposed CS modeling scheme, control strategy, and localization approach are applied to a couple of applications in automotive industry; the first one is the camshaft caps assembly of a cylinder head and the other is the air-intake manifold assembly of a powertrain. Efficient force-guided robotic assembly processes are obtained for both considered applications...|$|E
40|$|Surgical robots {{have been}} {{proposed}} ex vivo to drill <b>precise</b> <b>holes</b> in the temporal bone for minimally invasive cochlear implantation. The main risk of the procedure is damage {{of the facial nerve}} due to mechanical interaction or due to temperature elevation during the drilling process. To evaluate the thermal risk of the drilling process, a simplified model is proposed which aims to enable an assessment of risk posed to the facial nerve for a given set of constant process parameters for different mastoid bone densities. The model uses the bone density distribution along the drilling trajectory in the mastoid bone to calculate a time dependent heat production function {{at the tip of the}} drill bit. Using a time dependent moving point source Green's function, the heat equation can be solved at a certain point in space so that the resulting temperatures can be calculated over time. The model was calibrated and initially verified with in vivo temperature data. The data was collected in minimally invasive robotic drilling of 12 holes in four different sheep. The sheep were anesthetized and the temperature elevations were measured with a thermocouple which was inserted in a previously drilled hole next to the planned drilling trajectory. Bone density distributions were extracted from pre-operative CT data by averaging Hounsfield values over the drill bit diameter. Post-operative [Formula: see text]CT data was used to verify the drilling accuracy of the trajectories. The comparison of measured and calculated temperatures shows a very good match for both heating and cooling phases. The average prediction error of the maximum temperature was less than 0. 7  °C and the average root mean square error was approximately 0. 5  °C. To analyze potential thermal damage, the model was used to calculate temperature profiles and cumulative equivalent minutes at 43  °C at a minimal distance to the facial nerve. For the selected drilling parameters, temperature elevation profiles and cumulative equivalent minutes suggest that thermal elevation of this minimally invasive cochlear implantation surgery may pose a risk to the facial nerve, especially in sclerotic or high density mastoid bones. Optimized drilling parameters need to be evaluated and the model could be used for future risk evaluation...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} two {{relatively}} unexplored types of surface defects on silicon nitride balls – ‘star’ type defects and ‘missing material’. The main {{objective of this}} research is to determine failure modes and the critical or tolerable defect sizes for rolling bearing applications. This is achieved by means of both experimental and numerical techniques (for finding crack initiation location). A modified four-ball machine is used for the rolling contact fatigue experiments on star features and missing material defects (both during manufacturing process and artificially produced) on the surface of silicon nitride balls. Experiments are conducted at different loads (3. 8 - 4. 8 GPa), lubrication types, specific speed (7500 rpm) and temperature conditions (75 °C) to find rolling contact fatigue limitations in relation to these defects. Laser micromachining is used to produce <b>precise</b> <b>holes</b> and trenches to simulate missing material. Two different types of bearing grade silicon nitride are tested to determine tolerance and failure modes in rolling contact fatigue. Scanning electron microscopy, light microscopy and white light interferometry are used for surface analysis and topography. Post-experiment analysis in the star feature experiments has shown that star like radial cracks are prone to develop into missing material by internal fracture over the extent of the star in lubricated rolling contact. Lubrication quality or film thickness and orientation of the pre-existing cracks to the rolling direction influenced the damage process and severity. In the case of missing material experiments, samples with different diameters (50 - 100 μm), depths (5 - 50 μm) and shape (right cylindrical, conical and oblique cylindrical) were tested. It has been confirmed that, apart from the main experimental parameters like applied pressure, cavity diameter and depth, parameters such as cavity base profile, shape and cavity location and orientation on the contact track are important for rolling contact fatigue of silicon nitride material. Replica produced cavity base profiles to investigate failure reasons. Cross-sectioning also gave very good insight of surface and subsurface features both before and after testing (including un-failed specimens). Incipient spalls on tested samples provided the information to understand the failure mechanism (mainly spalling) in the material. FEM is used for finding stress fields at surface and sub-surface positions and ultimately predicting the location and position of crack initiation. 2 D (Axi-symmetric and plane strain) and 3 D models are developed to compare the results, whereas static versus quasi static analysis is presented to examine the effect of rolling. Models are verified using classical contact theory. Hydrostatic pressure effects are also successfully modeled using the finite element analysis approach. Fluid elements modeling on the solid interface of the cavity produced a different stress field and have indicated the location of crack initiation...|$|R
