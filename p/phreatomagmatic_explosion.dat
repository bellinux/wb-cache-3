30|$|After {{a series}} of {{intermittent}} ash emissions and Strombolian explosions from November 2014 to May 2015, a <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>explosion</b> occurred on 14 September 2015 (Miyabuchi et al. 2018). It {{was followed by a}} small <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>explosion</b> on 23 October 2015 and some minor phreatic explosions from December 2015 to March 2016 (JMA 2017). In March 2016, the lake water started to refill the crater bottom, and the surface area of the lake increased to 70 % of the crater bottom in July 2016. During March and September 2016, quite minor wet ash emissions from the crater bottom were frequently observed (JMA 2017). A minor explosion occurred at 21 : 52 JST (UTC +[*] 09 : 00) on 7 October 2016 followed by a large <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>explosion</b> at 01 : 46 JST on 8 October 2016 (JMA 2017). For the latter explosion, the top of the plume height observed by a geostationary meteorological satellite Himawari- 8 was estimated to be 13 – 14  km asl (Ishii et al. 2018). The total eruptive mass of the 7 – 8 October explosions was estimated to be 6.0 – 6.5 [*]×[*] 106 tons, and the juvenile magma erupted by the explosions accounted for 20 % of the deposits (Miyabuchi et al. 2017).|$|E

Furthermore, large summit craters with high crater-to-base ratios (Pike and Clow 1981) are also not common characteristics in the mounds.

30|$|The lack of <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>explosion</b> {{during the}} recent {{eruption}} cycle (2014 – 2015) suggests that the magmatic–hydrothermal interface has remained stable in this case. During the eruption periods of 1984 – 1985 and 1989 – 1991, frequent phreatomagmatic explosions occurred during the late stages, followed shortly by a crater lake recovery. Ono et al. (1995) suggested that these processes {{can be caused by}} water from a heavy precipitation. However, the continuing existence of a hydrothermal system surrounding the eruptive vent provides a condition for spontaneous phreatomagmatic explosions at the Aso volcano, with possible instability at the magmatic–hydrothermal interface occurring even during a continuous magmatic eruption, without any heavy precipitation.|$|E
30|$|This study {{focuses on}} the precursory changes of the plume {{activity}} before the phreatomagmatic eruptions using the ground-based monitoring of the plume intensity and the satellite measurements of SO 2 emissions. We evaluate the plume intensity as the plume height and compare it with the SO 2 mass estimated by the satellite measurements. Comparing a semiquantitative value (plume height) with a quantitative value (SO 2 mass), we appraise an efficiency of the plume monitoring. As a case study, we choose the <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>explosion</b> of Aso volcano, Japan, on 8 October 2016.

40|$|Three eruptive episodes {{during the}} 2006 summit eruptions of Mount Etna were {{exceptionally}} well documented by visual, seismic and thermal monitoring. The first (16 November) was strongly explosive, with vigorous Strombolian activity and ash emission from multiple vents, lava emission, and <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>explosions</b> generating pyroclastic density currents (PDCs). The second episode (19 November) {{had a rather}} weakly explosive component, with mild Strombolian activity but more voluminous lava emission. The third (24 November) was a moderately explosive paroxysm, with intermittent lava fountaining and generation of a tephra column as well as lava emission and PDCs. Data recorded by a thermal monitoring camera clearly document the different phases of each paroxysm, weather clouds occasionally hampering thermal monitoring. The images show a rapid onset of the volcanic activity, which during each of the paroxysms reached a peak in eruptive and thermal intensity, and then decreased gradually. The stronger <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>explosions</b> and PDCs on 16 and 24 November did not yield any seismic signature linked {{to the opening of}} new vents, nor were they associated with peculiar characteristics of the seismic signal. Nevertheless, eruptive styles (Strombolian activity, lava emission) and different levels in the intensity of explosive activity were generally well reflected in the amplitude and frequency content of the seismic signal, and in the source location of the volcanic tremor centroid throughout the three eruptive episodes. This multidisciplinary study, therefore, not only provides a key to distinguish between endogenous and exogenous origins of the phenomena observed, but also documents the complex magma dynamics within the volcano...|$|R

The central part of The Crater comprises basal accidental lithic rich tuff breccias and unsorted, weakly bedded lapilli tuffs inferred to have been deposited by "en masse " deposition of fall back tephra and/or high concentration pyroclastic density currents from vent opening phreatomagmatic explosions, near vent. The unit subsequently subsided into the conduit. Above this unit, is a juvenile rich lapilli tuff deposited near vent by high-concentration pyroclastic density currents. These pyroclastic density currents were generated by phreatomagmatic explosions occurring at shallow levels, which did not excavate significant amounts of subsurface strata. In the western side of the area a large and complex crater rim sequence has collapsed into the vent.

The C isotope data do not indicate whether the carbonate CO 2 was derived from the mantle or from hydrolysis of organic matter. The most probable source of mercury is the Ordovician black shales rather than a positive mercury anomaly in the mantle. The source of sulfur could not be determined by means of the S isotopes.

30|$|In the {{following}} months, waters accumulated within crater and the lake progressively grew up again.

In order to clarify the causal relationship between the conduit process and CT, further analyses of these events are required. An improved understanding of the fluid transport processes in shallow conduit systems at the volcano may lead to more effective hazard mitigation.|$|R

It cuts Proterozoic basement rocks and two Quaternary basanite lava flows, and is rimmed with an eroded tuff ring of debris from the <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>explosion</b> that generated the crater. A scoria cone on the northern wall of the crater was dissected by the explosion and exposes a dolerite plug that was intruded immediately prior to crater formation. The dolerite plug yields a 40 Ar/ 39 Ar age of 1. 147 ± 0. 004 Ma. This is the best possible estimate of the time Al Wahbah crater formed. It is a few tens of thousand years younger than {{the age of the}} lower and upper basalt flows, 1. 261 ± 0. 021 Ma and 1. 178 ± 0. 007 Ma respectively. A dolerite dyke exposed within the basement in the wall of the crater is dated at 1. 886 ± 0. 008 Ma. This is the most precise age so far determined for the initiation of basaltic volcanism of Harrat Kishb, and confirms that it is significantly younger than the other post-rift volcanic provinces in the region.

Viking and Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) images show lobate deposit boundaries, rheomorphic deformation, and numerous craters 270 – 580 m in diameter within the deposit. The deposit coincides with a broad topographic rise ∼ 30 km wide and ∼ 100 – 150 m high extending along the sides of the valley for at least 100 km along strike. We propose that these features formed when a dike underlying the axis of the valley generated a shallow sill, which in turn is partly responsible for the rise topography.

30|$|Anyhow, all the {{recorded}} parameters follow a relatively regular decreasing trend after the major explosion of November 27, 2014. Conversely, the temperatures of the Central Pit show a rather abrupt decrease, {{down to about}} 150  °C by mid-January 2015, and then fluctuate from below 100 – 220  °C {{until the end of}} June. This time span overlaps the ceasing of the Strombolian cycle, which occurs at the beginning of May (e.g., Nobile et al. 2017). A thermal pulse was then recorded in late July-early August 2015 (with apparent temperatures reaching 360  °C) followed by a decreasing trend below 100  °C that marks the reappearance of crater lake (late September 2015). Conversely, both temperatures and the heat flux recorded at the South Area have a moderate constant decrease until mid-February 2016, when they reach their minima, and then progressively rise being always below 300  °C and 1  MW, respectively. Also the temperatures of the Central Pit moderately rise from March 23 to June 8, 2016 reaching a relatively high value, of[*]~[*] 270  °C, on April 20. During this period, the crater lake dried out and was then replenished by July 6, 2016. We have to emphasize that the paucity of alerts detected by MIROVA from April 25, 2015 to November 24, 2016 is essentially related the relatively low values of thermal flux of the fumarole field (which, according to ground-based measurements, fluctuated around 1  MW at the end of April, and then dropped below) coupled with the low temperatures of the Central Pit and the South Area (cf. Fig.  7 a, third image from left). It is interesting to note that, following the major <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>explosion</b> of October 8, 2016, MIROVA started to detect alerts well above 1  MW (among them several at and/or slightly above 2  MW). It is therefore likely that the explosion of October 8 contributed to the reactivation of the fracture system associated with the hot fumaroles (Fig.  7, right images). This is also consistent with ground-based measurements.|$|E
5000|$|That the {{entrapped}} (within the edifice) water did not vapourise {{is shown}} {{by the absence of}} <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>explosions</b> except the mildly explosive eruptive activity that occurred at the Hoyo Negro vent from 12 July to 22 July: steam escaping explosively from the ground is often a precursor of volcanic activity. Further evidence that vapourisation did not occur is that when Rubio Bonelli visited the rift the following day, the newly opened fissure [...] "... Was not issuing fumes, vapour, steam, ashes, lava or other materials ..." [...] In fact at no time during or after was steam or phreatomagmatic activity reported. This reinforces the claim that the waters trapped within the edifice never vapourised, which they would do if the pressure had fallen sufficiently to allow the super-heated water to flash into steam. Only at the Hoyo Negro did any phreatomagmatic activity occur.|$|R

Behncke, S. Falsaperla, E. Pecora Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione di Catania; Piazza Roma, 2; 95123 Catania, Italy Three eruptive episodes of the Southeast Crater {{at the summit}} of Mount Etna in November 2006 were exceptionally well documented by visual, seismic and thermal monitoring. In terms of volcanic activity, the three paroxysms showed marked differences among each other. The first one (16 November) was a strongly explosive event, with vigorous Strombolian activity and ash emission from multiple vents, lava emission, and <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>explosions</b> generating pyroclastic density currents. In contrast, the second episode (19 November) was a rather weakly explosive event, with mild Strombolian activity but more voluminous lava emission. Finally, the third paroxysm (24 November) was a moderately explosive event, with intermittent lava fountaining and generation of a tephra column as well as lava emission and pyroclastic flows. Data recorded by a thermal monitoring camera clearly document the different phases of each paroxysm, although weather clouds occasionally hampered thermal monitoring. The images show a rapid onset of the volcanic activity, which reached a peak in eruptive (and thermal) intensity, and then decreased gradually. The analysis of seismic activity highlights {{a wide range of}} different types of signals, reflecting remarkable complexities in the dynamics of the eruptive events. The different explosive intensities are well reflected in the volcanic tremor amplitude, although the three episodes show common features, such as a maximum in tremor amplitude during their first hour, and a number of strong explosive events during the waning phases of each paroxysm. A neat correlation between typologies of seismic signals and eruptive styles and intensities can be established from the data.

40|$|Despite {{the recent}} {{recognition}} of Mount Etna as a periodically violently explosive volcano, the hazards from {{various types of}} pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) have until now received virtually no attention at this volcano. Large-scale pyroclastic flows last occurred during the caldera-forming Ellittico eruptions, 15 – 16 ka ago, {{and the risk of}} them occurring in the near future is negligible. However, minor PDCs can affect much of the summit area and portions of the upper flanks of the volcano. During the past ~ 20 years, small pyroclastic flows or base-surge-like vapor and ash clouds have occurred in at least 8 cases during summit eruptions of Etna. Four different mechanisms of PDC generation have been identified during these events: (1) collapse of pyroclastic fountains (as in 2000 and possibly in 1986); (2) <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>explosions</b> resulting from mixing of lava with wet rock (2006); (3) <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>explosions</b> resulting from mixing of lava with thick snow (2007); (4) disintegration of the unstable flanks of a lava dome-like structure growing over the rim of one of the summit craters (1999). All of these recent PDCs were of a rather minor extent (maximum runout lengths were about 1. 5 km in November 2006 and March 2007) and thus they represented no threat for populated areas and human property around the volcano. Yet, events of this type pose a significant threat to the lives of people visiting the summit area of Etna, and areas in a radius of 2 km from the summit craters should be off-limits anytime an event capable of producing similar PDCs occurs. The most likely source of further PDCs in the near future is the Southeast Crater, the youngest, most active and most unstable of the four summit craters of Etna, where 6 of the 8 documented recent PDCs originated. It is likely that similar hazards exist in a number of volcanic settings elsewhere, especially at snow- or glacier-covered volcanoes and on volcano slopes strongly affected by hydrothermal alteration...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a new type}} of secondary rootless phreatomagmatic explosions observed at active lava flows at volcanoes Klyuchevskoy (Russia) and Etna (Italy). The explosions occurred at considerable (up to 5 km) distances from primary volcanic vents, generally at steep (15 – 35 °) slopes, and in places where incandescent basaltic or basaltic-andesitic lava propagated over ice/water-saturated substrate. The explosions produced high (up to 7 km) vertical ash/steam-laden clouds as well as pyroclastic flows that traveled up to 2 km downslope. Individual lobes of the pyroclastic flow deposits were up to 2 m thick, had steep lateral margins, and were composed of angular to subrounded bomb-size clasts in a poorly sorted ash–lapilli matrix. Character of the juvenile rock clasts in the pyroclastic flows (poorly vesiculated with chilled and fractured cauliflower outer surfaces) indicated their origin by explosive fragmentation of lava due to contact with external water. Non-juvenile rocks derived from the substrate of the lava flows comprised up to 75 % in some of the pyroclastic flow deposits. We suggest a model where gradual heating of a water-saturated substrate under the advancing lava flow elevates pore pressure and thus reduces basal friction (in the case of frozen substrate water is initially formed by thawing of the substrate along the contact with lava). On steep slope this leads to gravitational instability and sliding of a part of the active lava flow and water-saturated substrate. The sliding lava and substrate disintegrate and intermix, triggering explosive “fuel–coolant” type interaction that produces large volume of fine-grained clastic material. Relatively cold steam-laden cloud of the <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>explosion</b> has limited capacity to transport upward the produced clastic material, thus part of it descends downslope in the form of pyroclastic flow. Similar explosive events were described for active lava flows of Llaima (Chile), Pavlof (Alaska), and Hekla (Iceland) indicating that this type of explosions and related hazard is common at snow/ice-clad volcanoes and sometimes happens also on fluid-saturated hydrothermally altered slopes...|$|E
40|$|Sequences of basaltic pillow lavas that {{transition}} upwards with systematic gradation from pillow fragment breccias to fluidal bomb-bearing breccia to bomb-bearing lapilli tuffs are common at Askja volcano, Iceland. Based on the detailed textural investigation {{of three of}} these sequences, we argue that they record temporally continuous transition from effusive to explosive products that were erupted from and deposited at or near a single subaqueous vent. The recognition of such sequences is important as they provide evidence for controls on the onset of explosive activity in subaqueous environments. Such investigations are complicated by the interplay of magmatic gas expansion, phreatomagmatic and mechanical granulation fragmentation mechanisms in the subaqueous eruptive environment. All of the sequences studied at Askja have textural, componentry and sedimentological characteristics suggestive of a close genetic and spatial relationship between the pillow lavas {{and all of the}} overlying glassy clastic deposits. The identification of magma fragmentation signatures in pyroclasts was accomplished through detailed textural studies of pyroclasts within the full range of grain sizes of a given deposit i. e. bomb/blocks, lapilli and fine ash. These textural characteristics were compared and evaluated as discriminators of fragmentation in pyroclastic deposits. The presence of angular vitric clasts within the breccia and lapilli tuff displaying fragile glassy projections indicates little or no postdepositional textural modification. A shift in vesicle and clast textures between the pillow lavas and the large concentration of fluidal bombs in the breccia indicate that the phreatomagmatic explosions were initially triggered by magmatic vesiculation. The initial magmatic gas expansion may have been triggered by depressurization caused by the drainage of the ice-confined lake surrounding Askja. The Fuel Coolant Interactions (FCI) of the more efficient <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>explosion</b> was enabled by the increase in the surface area to volume ratio of the fluidal bombs in the water, producing a premix of magma and water. The onset and increasing influence of phreatomagmatic fragmentation is preserved in the presence of very fine blocky ash particles and diminished presence of larger particles such as fluidal bombs. The textural, sedimentological and environmental characteristics of these deposits suggest that phreatomagmatic explosions can be triggered by initial magmatic gas expansion, but that it is likely one of many mechanisms for triggering such explosions...|$|E
40|$|The Trepca Pb-Zn-Ag skarn deposit (29 Mt of ore at 3. 45 % Pb, 2. 30 % Zn, and 80 g/t Ag) {{is located}} in the Kopaonik block of the western Vardar zone, Kosovo. The mineralization, hosted by recrystallized {{limestone}} of Upper Triassic age, was structurally and lithologically controlled. Ore deposition is spatially and temporally related with the postcollisional magmatism of Oligocene age (23 - 26 Ma). The deposit was formed during two distinct mineralization stages: an early prograde closed-system and a later retrograde open-system stage. The prograde mineralization consisting mainly of pyroxenes (Hd(54 - 100) Jo(0 - 45) Di(0 - 45)) resulted from the interaction of magmatic fluids associated with Oligocene (23 - 26 Ma) postcollisional magmatism. Whereas there is no direct contact between magmatic rocks and the mineralization, the deposit is classified as a distal Pb-Zn-Ag skarn. Abundant pyroxene reflects low oxygen fugacity (< 10 (- 31) bar) and anhydrous environment. Fluid inclusion data and mineral assemblage limit the prograde stage within a temperature range between 390 degrees and 475 degrees C. Formation pressure is estimated below 900 bars. Isotopic composition of aqueous fluid, inclusions hosted by hedenbergite (delta D = - 108 to - 130 parts per thousand; delta O- 18 = 7. 5 - 8. 0 parts per thousand), Mn-enriched mineralogy and high REE content of the host carbonates at the contact with the skarn mineralization suggest that a magmatic fluid was modified during its infiltration through the country rocks. The retrograde mineral assemblage comprises ilvaite, magnetite, arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite, marcasite, pyrite, quartz, and various carbonates. Increases in oxygen and sulfur fugacities, as well as a hydrous character of mineralization, require an open-system model. The opening of the system is related to <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>explosion</b> and formation of the breccia. Arsenopyrite geothermometer limits the retrograde stage within the temperature range between 350 degrees and 380 degrees C and sulfur fugacity between 10 (- 8. 8) and 10 (- 7. 2) bars. The principal ore minerals, galena, sphalerite, pyrite, and minor chalcopyrite, were deposited from a moderately saline Ca-Na chloride fluid at around 350 degrees C. According to the isotopic composition of fluid inclusions hosted by sphalerite (delta D = - 55 to - 74 parts per thousand; delta O- 18 = - 9. 6 to - 13. 6 parts per thousand), the fluid responsible for ore deposition was dominantly meteoric in origin. The delta S- 31 values of the sulfides spanning between - 5. 5 and + 10 parts per thousand point to a magmatic origin of sulfur. Ore deposition appears to have been largely contemporaneous with the retrograde stage of the skarn development. Postore stage accompanied the precipitation of significant amount of carbonates including the travertine deposits at the deposit surface. Mineralogical composition of travertine varies from calcite to siderite and all carbonates contain significant amounts of Mn.

30|$|Instability of the magmatic–hydrothermal {{interface}} {{may cause}} phreatomagmatic eruptions (Morrissey et al. 2000). Phreatic or <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>explosions</b> {{are a common}} feature {{at the end of}} the eruption cycles of the Aso volcano (Sudo et al. 2006). During the continuous ash eruptions, from November 2014 to May 2015, phreatic to phreatomagmatic eruptions did not occur and the interface seemed stable. The occasional hydrothermal solution input to the degassing conduit, forming the salt fallouts, did not cause further perturbation of the interface. The southern part of the crater floor, 100  m wide, suddenly subsided by 50  m on May 3, 2015, without any significant eruptive activity. The frequency and intensity of the ash eruptions decreased thereafter, and the eruption ceased on May 21, 2015. The crater lake water subsequently recovered by June 6, 2015. The immediate recovery of the crater lake is consistent with the continuous existence of a hydrothermal system.|$|R

The former are dominated by ejection of material during numerous discrete <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>explosions,</b> brecciation, and subsidence of diatreme fill, while the latter are dominated by subsidence over a partly evacuated magma chamber during sustained, magmatic volatile-driven discharge. Many examples share characteristics of both, including landforms that are identified as maars but preserve deposits from non-phreatomagmatic explosive activity, and ambiguous structures that appear to be coalesced maars but that also produced sustained explosive eruptions with likely magma reservoir subsidence.

Scientists believed that pulses of magma mixed together in the chamber before climbing upward—a process estimated to take several thousands of years. But Columbia University volcanologists found that the eruption of Costa Rica’s Irazu volcano in 1963 was likely triggered by magma that took a nonstop route from the mantle over just a few months. Study authors called it the highway from hell.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Trepča Pb-Zn-Ag skarn deposit (29 Mt of ore at 3. 45 % Pb, 2. 30 % Zn, and 80 g/t Ag) {{is located}} in the Kopaonik block of the western Vardar zone, Kosovo. The mineralization, hosted by recrystallized {{limestone}} of Upper Triassic age, was structurally and lithologically controlled. Ore deposition is spatially and temporally related with the postcollisional magmatism of Oligocene age (23 - 26 Ma). The deposit was formed during two distinct mineralization stages: an early prograde closed-system and a later retrograde open-system stage. The prograde mineralization consisting mainly of pyroxenes (Hd 54 - 100 Jo 0 - 45 Di 0 - 45) resulted from the interaction of magmatic fluids associated with Oligocene (23 - 26 Ma) postcollisional magmatism. Whereas there is no direct contact between magmatic rocks and the mineralization, the deposit is classified as a distal Pb-Zn-Ag skarn. Abundant pyroxene reflects low oxygen fugacity (< 10 − 31 bar) and anhydrous environment. Fluid inclusion data and mineral assemblage limit the prograde stage within a temperature range between 390 ° and 475 °C. Formation pressure is estimated below 900 bars. Isotopic composition of aqueous fluid inclusions hosted by hedenbergite (δD = − 108 to − 130 ‰; δ 18 O = 7. 5 - 8. 0 ‰), Mn-enriched mineralogy and high REE content of the host carbonates at the contact with the skarn mineralization suggest that a magmatic fluid was modified during its infiltration through the country rocks. The retrograde mineral assemblage comprises ilvaite, magnetite, arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite, marcasite, pyrite, quartz, and various carbonates. Increases in oxygen and sulfur fugacities, as well as a hydrous character of mineralization, require an open-system model. The opening of the system is related to <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>explosion</b> and formation of the breccia. Arsenopyrite geothermometer limits the retrograde stage within the temperature range between 350 ° and 380 °C and sulfur fugacity between 10 − 8. 8 and 10 − 7. 2 bars. The principal ore minerals, galena, sphalerite, pyrite, and minor chalcopyrite, were deposited from a moderately saline Ca-Na chloride fluid at around 350 °C.

The δ 34 S values of the sulfides spanning between − 5. 5 and + 10 ‰ point to a magmatic origin of sulfur. Ore deposition appears to have been largely contemporaneous with the retrograde stage of the skarn development. Postore stage accompanied the precipitation of significant amount of carbonates including the travertine deposits at the deposit surface.

50|$|Evidence {{shows that}} the {{eruption}} was a single event, that lasted 2 to 4 days initiated by a Plinian eruption, triggered by abrupt changes in composition, properties and physical state in the melt or overpressure in the magma chamber. The eruption started with <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>explosions,</b> followed by {{the formation of the}} Plinian eruption column, fed by simultaneous extraction of two magma layers. The resulting ash plume is estimated to have had a height of 70 km. As gradually an unstable pulsating column formed, fed only by the most evolved magma due to upward migration of the fragmentation surface, reduced magma eruption rate, and/or activation of fractures, the Plinian phase ended. Emissions consisted of pumice and dark colored volcanic rock (Scoria). The mafic minerals cover smaller areas than the more acidic members, also indicating a decrease of explosivity {{over the course of the}} eruption. The eruption column caused a large pumice-fall deposit to the east of the source area.|$|R

Laboratory simulations using immiscible fluids of contrasting density indicate that the structure of the source flow at the vent depends critically on the relative magnitudes of buoyancy and momentum fluxes as reflected in the Richardson number (Ri). Analogue laboratory experiments of buoyant discharges demonstrate a variety of complex flow structures with the potential for greatly enhanced entrainment of surrounding seawater. Such conditions are likely to favor a positive feedback between <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>explosions</b> and volatile degassing that will contribute to explosive volcanism.

40|$|The Nesjahraun is a basaltic {{lava flow}} erupted from a subaerial fissure, {{extending}} NE along the Þingvellir graben from the Hengill central volcano that produced p?hoehoe lava followed by ‘a‘?. The Nesjahraun entered Iceland’s largest lake, Þingvallavatn, along its southern shore during both {{phases of the}} eruption and exemplifies lava flowing into water in a lacustrine environment {{in the absence of}} powerful wave action. This study combines airborne light detection and ranging, sidescan sonar and Chirp seismic data with field observations to investigate the behaviour of the lava as it entered the water. P?hoehoe sheet lava was formed during {{the early stages of the}} eruption. Along the shoreline, stacks of thin (5 – 20 cm thick), vesicular, flows rest upon and surround low ( 2 m deep, ? 50 m long, spaced ? 50 m apart and have sub-horizontal striations on the walls. They likely represent channels or collapsed tubes along which lava was delivered into the water. A circular rootless cone, Eldborg, formed when water infiltrated a lava tube. Offshore from the p?hoehoe lavas, the gradient of the flow surface steepens, suggesting a change in flow regime and the development of a talus ramp. Later, the flow was focused into a channel of ‘a‘? lava, ? 200 – 350 m wide. This split into individual flow lobes 20 – 50 m wide along the shore. ‘A‘? clinker is exposed on the water’s edge, as well as glassy sand and gravel, which has been locally intruded by small (< 1 m), irregularly shaped, lava bodies. The cores of the flow lobes contain coherent, but hackly fractured lava. Mounds consisting predominantly of scoria lapilli and the large paired half-cone of Grámelur were formed in <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>explosions.</b> The ‘a‘? flow can be identified underwater over 1 km offshore, and the sidescan data suggest that the flow lobes remained coherent flowing down a gradient of < 10 °.

40|$|The eruptive {{episode of}} Mount Etna’s Southeast Crater (SEC) on 16 November 2006, which culminated with <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>explosions</b> and a {{peculiar}} volcaniclastic flowage event, {{is the subject}} of different interpretations. Behncke (2009) and Behncke et al. (2008, 2009), interpret the explosions as resulting from mixing of flowing lava with fluid-saturated, hydrothermally altered rock, and describe the resulting flow as a low-temperature (but potentially deadly) pyroclastic density current (PDC). Norini et al. (2009) speak of gravity-induced flank collapse affecting the SEC cone, leading to the emplacement of a landslide (or debris avalanche) deposit. Finally, Ferlito et al., commenting our recent work (Behncke et al., 2009), re-propose their earlier (2007) scenario of a shallow intrusion from the SEC conduit, caused by unloading and decompression when a part of the SEC cone flank was removed (“sector collapse”), leading to the explosive opening of an eruptive fissure, which discharged a pyroclastic flow. An outstanding feature of this event is that it was not accompanied by any significant change in the seismic signal, which led us (Behncke et al. 2009) to exclude the opening of an eruptive fissure. However, Ferlito et al. point out that seismic evidence alone does not rule out their scenario, and cite the lack of seismic signals accompanying the start of the (rather voluminous, in terms of lava discharge, but purely effusive) 2004 - 2005 Etna eruption as support for their hypothesis. Finally, they describe what they interpret as the source fissure for the <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>explosions</b> and PDCs, and was the site of minor lava extrusion {{toward the end of the}} 16 November 2006 event. On their website, Ferlito et al. host a short (< 2 min) clip excerpted from a 40 : 54 min long video recorded by G. Tomarchio, cameraman of the Italian public television RAI, featuring only the 1425 GMT explosion and PDC. The integral, original version of that video (which was made available to INGV-CT immediately after the event) documents, amongst others, the presence of Behncke and INGV colleagues on-site, and shows a number of extremely similar explosions and PDCs over several hours prior to 1425 GMT, only on a smaller scale. As for the 1425 GMT event, the video spectacularly shows explosive activity, but nothing proving the opening of an eruptive fissure, neither does it show any landsliding as surmised by Norini et al. (2009). Our careful viewing of 1500 still photographs taken of the activity on that day, including nearly 1000 taken by INGV staff, plus other videos taken from different viewpoints (e. g., Movie S 3 in the auxiliary material to our article) leads us to analogous conclusions. Videos and photographs document dozens of minor explosive, PDC-generating events before the major <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>explosions</b> and PDCs at 1425 GMT. The mechanisms of these events were virtually the same throughout, differing only in their magnitude. All were caused by hot, flowing lava mixing with wet, hydrothermally altered rocks making up the SEC cone’s flank that the lava was burrowing through. The “eruptive fracture” that Ferlito et al. refer to is a secondary feature, formed at the toe of a lava flow, which had flowed down the ESE side of the cone early on 16 November 2006 and was severed around noon by the progressive enlargement of the large scar eroded into the cone’s flank. Draining of the lava within the active channel of the severed flow led to accumulation of lava at the cone’s base, developing into a sort of bubble. For reasons unknown, this bubble drained during the late afternoon, yielding an extremely small flow. The pocket evacuated by this outflow subsided to become what Ferlito et al. interpret as an eruptive fissure, a single slightly elongate collapse depression, lying approximately 150 m northeast of the locus of the 1425 GMT <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>explosions,</b> which is well visible in aerial photographs taken after the events under discussion (Figure 1). The lava flow that Ferlito et al. claim to have sampled is the secondary flow formed by the draining of the pocket. It has no whatsoever genetic relationship with the <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>explosions</b> and PDCs of 1425 GMT. Another fundamental argument lies in the seismic record, and it is here that Ferlito et al. miss two major points. Firstly, unlike the seismic scenario usually observed at Etna in more than three decades of monitoring (e. g., Patanè et al., 2004), the start of the 2004 - 2005 lava effusion was exceptionally silent as many authors noted (e. g., Burton et al., 2005; Di Grazia et al., 2006; Corsaro et al., 2009). The onset of lava emission was indeed completely and unusually aseismic (in terms of volcano-tectonic seismicity, volcanic tremor changes, etc.), but it was also totally non-explosive, due to the nearly complete depletion in gas of the magma. Therefore, this effusive episode stands in marked contrast with the 16 November 2006 activity. It should be noted that when new, gas-rich magma moved toward the surface at a later stage of the 2004 - 2005 lava effusion, the volcanic tremor amplitude markedly increased (Di Grazia et al., 2006). Secondly, Ferlito et al. refer to papers (e. g., Cardaci et al., 1993; Patanè et al., 2004) which deal with the relationship between volcano-tectonic (VT) seismicity and the triggering of eruptive activity at Etna. VT seismicity covers just a part of the information contained in a seismic record (e. g., McNutt, 2000), a detail which can be easily missed by non-experts in seismology. There is indeed a variety of signals (e. g., long-period events, hybrid events, volcanic tremor, explosion quakes) related to the movement of fluids and/or magma, which can herald and accompany the opening of eruptive fractures. We did extensive cross-checking of the seismic record of the entire 2006 eruptive sequence, paying particular attention to episodes of new eruptive fissures opening. Each single event marked by the opening of new vents displaying some sort of explosive activity (this occurred during at least four of the paroxysms during the August-December 2006 eruptive sequence) shows conspicuous changes not only in the amplitude of the seismic (tremor) signal, but also in the location of the centroid of the tremor source, and frequency content, features amply discussed in our paper (Behncke et al., 2009). The migration of subsurface magma can thus be well documented, if it is accompanied by degassing. We would also like to point out that the <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>explosions</b> and PDCs of 1425 GMT occurred shortly after a conspicuous drop in the volcanic tremor amplitude (see Fig. 8 in Behncke et al., 2009). The lack of changes in the seismic signals concurrent with the PDC is also evident in the spectrograms (in which the frequency content excludes the occurrence of any seismic signals associated with fracturing, see Fig. 9 in Behncke et al., 2009) and in the records of all the broadband stations considered by Behncke et al. (2009), notwithstanding their vicinity to the site of the PDC-generating explosions (EBEL and ECPN are located ~ 1 km from the SEC, at 2899 and 3050 m elevation above sea level, respectively). Finally, the hypothesis of magma uprise at the base of the SEC cone caused by unloading related to the removal of a major portion of the cone’s flank, has been vested by Ferlito et al. (2007) in a volcanic sector collapse scenario similar to the catastrophic 1980 debris avalanche at Mount St. Helens. Volcanic sector collapse commonly takes place instantaneously, which is the contrary of what happened at the SEC on 16 November 2006. Thanks to our presence on site from the early morning onward, we were able to document how the removal of a portion of the flank of the cone occurred extremely slowly, over at least 5 hours (cf. Fig. 5 in Behncke et al., 2008). The material involved in this displacement moved at best at 50 - 80 m per hour, which is rather unlike the speed of volcanic debris avalanches. There was no such thing as a major landslide, and no such thing as a new eruptive fissure opening; what did happen was a very hazardous sequence of events, including <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>explosions</b> and quite low-temperature but fast-moving, dense pyroclastic density currents. Such volcanic phenomena deserve in-depth multidisciplinary studies, and the ongoing discussion underscores how much work is still necessary to better understand the dynamics of a versatile volcano such as Mount Etna...|$|R
