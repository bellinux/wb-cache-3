5|$|Between 1975 and 1996, the Portrack Incinerator on the River Tees burned 200,000 tonnes of Teesside's waste every year, {{generating}} 20 {{megawatts of}} electricity in doing so. In November 1996, the <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> closed down after it failed to meet emission regulations; it was then demolished in stages between 1998 and 2000. Following {{the closure of the}} Portrack plant, a new facility to burn Teesside's refuse was constructed. Teesside Energy from Waste <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> opened in May 1998 as a collaboration between SITA UK (the station's operator) and the local authorities of Stockton-on-Tees, Middlesbrough, Hartlepool and Redcar & Cleveland.|$|E

5|$|In 1883, Cornell {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{university}} campuses to use electricity to light the grounds from a water-powered dynamo. In 1904, a hydroelectric <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> built in the Fall Creek gorge. The plant takes water from Beebe Lake through a tunnel in the side of the gorge to power up to 1.9 megawatts of electricity. The plant continued to serve the campus's electric needs until 1970, when local utility rates placed a heavy economic penalty on independently generating electricity. The abandoned <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> vandalized in 1972, but renovated and placed back into service in 1981.|$|E
50|$|Male {{and female}} flowers of the hop plant usually develop on {{separate}} <b>plants</b> (that <b>is,</b> the <b>plant</b> <b>is</b> dioecious), although fertile monoecious individuals appear occasionally. Because viable seeds are undesirable for brewing beer, only female <b>plants</b> <b>are</b> grown in hop fields, thus preventing pollination. Female <b>plants</b> <b>are</b> propagated vegetatively, and male <b>plants</b> <b>are</b> culled if <b>plants</b> <b>are</b> grown from seeds.|$|R

5|$|In 1925, NESCo set up {{separate}} {{plant at}} the power station for the low temperature carbonisation treatment of coal, before being burned in boilers and the steam used for electricity generation. The treatment <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> manufactured by Babcock & Wilcox, and {{set up in a}} self-contained boiler house which contained four boilers, four retorts and pulverising mills. The building was also fitted with gas-stripping and by-product plants. The carbonising plant could handle up to 100 tonnes of coal per day, while its boilers produced 78,000lb of steam per hour. This <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> extended in 1931.|$|E

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted at}} Cereal Crops Research Institute Pirsabak Nowshera during 2002 - 03 on six wheat cultivars/advance lines to identify the best suitable time of planting in the central agro-ecological zone of NWFP. Randomized complete block design was used with 3 replications. Six <b>planting</b> dates <b>were</b> used from October 25 th to December 15 th with 10 days increment. Data were recorded on Days to 50 % heading, Days to maturity, Plant height and Grain yield. Maximum number of days (132) to 50 % heading <b>were</b> recorded when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> done on October 25 th Minimum number of days (114) <b>were</b> reported when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> done on December, 15 th. Maximum number of days (178) to maturity <b>were</b> recorded when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> done on October 25 th. Number of days to maturity decreased as <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> delayed with 10 days increment. Minimum number of days (130) <b>were</b> recorded when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> delayed till 15 th of December. Highest plant height (98 cm) <b>was</b> recorded when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> done on October 25 th and November 05 th. Plant Height decreased as <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> delayed. Minimum <b>Plant</b> height (85 cm) <b>was</b> recorded when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> delayed till 15 th of December. Maximum grain yield (3937 kg ha - 1) <b>was</b> recorded when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> done on November 05 th. Grain yield decreased as <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> delayed with 10 days increment. Minimum grain yield (2274 kg ha - 1) <b>was</b> observed when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> done on 15 th of December. A negative correlation <b>was</b> recorded between <b>planting</b> dates and days to 50 % heading, days to maturity, Plant height and Grain yield. The yield losses due to late <b>planting</b> recorded <b>were</b> 8 % when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> done on November 15 th, 22 % loss when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> done on 25 th November, 34 % losses <b>were</b> incurred when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> done on December 5 th and 42 % losses <b>were</b> recorded when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> further delayed till December 15 th.

5|$|Weapons {{production}} at the <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> halted after a combined FBI and EPA raid in 1989. Due {{to the end of}} the Cold War, changes in nuclear weapons policy, and years of protests, the Rocky Flats <b>Plant</b> <b>was</b> shut down, with its buildings demolished and completely removed from the site. The site's mission then changed to cleanup. The Rocky Flats <b>Plant</b> <b>was</b> declared a CERCLASuperfund site in 1989 and began its transformation to a cleanup site in February 1992. Removal of the plant and surface contamination was largely completed in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with federal and state agency support and stakeholder input. The cleanup effort decommissioned and demolished over 800 structures; removed over 21 tons of weapons-grade material; removed over 1.3 million cubic meters of waste; and, treated more than 16 million gallons of water. Four groundwater treatment systems were also constructed. The site achieved regulatory closure in 2006.|$|E

5|$|Construction began before {{completion}} of the design for the gaseous diffusion process. Due to {{the large amount of}} electric power that the K-25 <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> expected to consume, it was decided to provide it with its own electric power plant.
