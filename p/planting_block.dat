40|$|Abstract: Reciprocal {{transplant}} studies {{examined the}} contribution of genetic differentiation and phenotypic plasticity to intraspecific variation in blue oak (Quercus douglasii) seedling survival and growth. A nested, mixed model design partitioned seedling survival and growth responses into between-population effects, within-population (among family) effects, and environmental effects. Significant between-population differences in seedling survivorship and growth were observed at both sites. Interactions between population source and <b>planting</b> <b>block</b> suggest local scale adaptation. Differences among maternal families in survival and growth were significant. Phenotypic variation in seedling performance {{may be related to}} indices of acorn quality such as embryo dry weight. Although blue oak (Quercus douglasii Hook. & Arn.) is found only in California, it has a wide geographic distribution within the state. In wideranging plant species, it is often assumed that natural selection has resulted in the formation of genetically differentiated populations adapted to local environmental conditions. For example, provenance testing in many conifer species has indicated that there is often adaptive differentiation in response t...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Entomology, Washington State UniversityHybrid poplars are a short {{rotation}} woody crop {{grown for}} a variety of target markets including paper pulp, saw timber, and biofuels in the Pacific Northwest. Development of pest control strategies within hybrid poplar plantations over the last several decades has focused on controlling foliar feeding herbivores and wood boring pests, and has overlooked the epigeal arthropod community. Understanding this unstudied suite of organisms would allow pest managers to better evaluate the impact their management strategies have on the poplar agroecosystem. Qualitative surveys of the arthropod communities in hybrid poplar plantations and nearby native habitats demonstrated that a greater arthropod diversity persists in the surrounding native areas. Additionally, the poplar plantation's epigeal arthropod community was composed of species found within sampled native areas. Historically poplar research focused on protecting trees in the years following establishment through harvest from emerging pests while discounting cutting mortality by replanting areas of failure. Describing unrooted cutting transplant morality and distribution within newly established <b>planting</b> <b>block</b> could provide a risk assessment tool that growers could utilize to evaluate their potential crop loss. It was determined through the examination of damaged cuttings that several pests were responsible for diminishing establishment success. Identification of these risks {{led to the development of}} a management strategy to reduce mortality in newly planted areas. Soaking cuttings in imidacloprid for 48 hrs provided superior herbivore protection for unrooted cuttings until root formation allowed for uptake from chemigation treatments. An additional study was motivated by the increased concern in growing `clear wood' as poplar has migrated from pulp to saw timber. The accompanying renewed interest in reducing insect galleries in mature trees led to the exploration of deploying a mass trapping, or trap out, effort to reduce populations of Prionoxystus robiniae (Lepidoptera Cossidae) in specific areas of a hybrid poplar plantation. We show that a trap out effort of roughly 5 pheromone-baited traps/ha decimated P. robiniae populations in treated areas throughout the trap out effort and three years post application.

The features of reliability evaluation of electric power <b>plants</b> <b>block</b> schemes were considered in terms of functioning of the electricity market. Objective: to increase the operational reliability of electric power <b>plants</b> <b>block</b> schemes and to reduce the probability of electricity undersupply. Technique of realization: the implementation of modern algorithms and programs for evaluation of the reliability of block schemes. Results: The main methods of analysis of the reliability of electric power <b>plants</b> <b>block</b> schemes were analyzed, numerical values of integral reliability index were obtained according to the number of failures in the circuit. Conclusions: It was shown that the Markov processes method applied for the analysis of reliability of the block schemes of electric power plants is advantageous both at the design stage and in operation or reconstruction. ???????? ????????????? ?????? ??????? ??????????? ?????????? ??????????? ???? ?????????????? ?? ?????? ??????????????. ??????????? ??????????? ?????????? ?????????? ??????????? ???? ?????????????? ? ?????? ???????????????? ????? ????????????? ???????. ???? ????????????: ????????? ???????????????? ?????????? ??????????? ???? ?????????????? ? ???????? ?????????? ?????????????? ????????????? ???????. ???????? ??????????: ????????? ??????????? ?????????? ? ???????? ?????? ?????????? ??????????? ????. ?????????? ????????????: ???????????????? ???????? ?????? ??????? ?????????? ??????????? ???? ??????????????, ???????? ????????? ???????? ????????????? ?????????? ?????????? ? ??????????? ?? ?????????? ??????? ? ?????. ??????: ???????? ???????????? ?????????? ?????? ?????????? ????????? ????????? ??? ??????? ?????????? ??????????? ???? ??????????????, ??? ?? ????? ??????????????, ??? ? ? ???????? ???????????? ??? ?????????????...|$|R

[...] "But the trouble is they tend to be monoculture plantations. They are not places where birds want to live."

However, existing concrete is strongly alkaline due to hydrates generated by the hydration reaction of cement and water; this alkalinity has adverse effects on the environment. In particular, secondary damage has continued to emerge due to the environmental destruction of waterfront environments along rivers and the continuous elution caused by strong alkalinity.|$|R
