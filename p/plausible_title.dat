60|$|As to {{the unfortunate}} gentlemen who may {{at any time}} compose that system, which, under the <b>plausible</b> <b>title</b> of an administration, subsists but for the {{establishment}} of weakness and confusion; they fall into different classes, with different merits. I think the situation of some people in that state may deserve a certain degree of compassion; {{at the same time that}} they furnish an example, which, it is to be hoped, by being a severe one, will have its effect, at least, on the growing generation; if an original seduction, on plausible but hollow pretences, into loss of honor, friendship, consistency, security, and repose, can furnish it. It is possible to draw, even from the very prosperity of ambition, examples of terror, and motives to compassion.|$|E
50|$|With a sorrow {{which he}} could not conceal, he saw that army march which {{penetrated}} {{into the heart of}} the Swiss mountains, and imposed on their hardy inhabitants a constitution in which Bonaparte, under the <b>plausible</b> <b>title</b> of Mediator, secured the co-operation of the valiant descendants of the Celtic tribe of Helvetii in his further schemes of conquest and ambition.|$|E
5000|$|Extant {{primary sources}} make it <b>plausible</b> that the <b>title</b> of khagan {{was applied to}} the rulers of the Rus' during a rather short period, roughly between their embassy to Constantinople (838) and Basil I's letter (871). All Byzantine sources after Basil I refer to the Rus' rulers as archons (Greek for [...] "ruler").|$|R
40|$|Is life plausible? WeU, it's {{more than}} plausible, it has {{actually}} happened! What {{we need to}} ask, rather, is whether our explanations for how life came about and diversified are <b>plausible.</b> So the <b>title</b> of Marc W. Kirschner and John C. Gerhart's book implies the wrong question. Despite that. The Plausibility of Life makes for informative and enjoyable reading, and the issues the authors raise are worthy of attention...|$|R
5000|$|To {{keep the}} show's <b>title</b> <b>plausible,</b> the show's head writer, George Tibbles, {{fashioned}} a three-part story arc {{in which an}} orphaned friend of youngest brother Richard (Chip, played by Stanley Livingston), Ernie Thompson (played by his real-life brother, Barry Livingston), awaits adoption when his current foster parents are transferred to the Orient. Steve offers to adopt Ernie, but faces antagonism from Uncle Charley, who finds Ernie a bit grating, and forecasts major headaches over both {{the boy and his}} dog. It also transpires that a law requires a woman to live in the home of an adoptive family. A likable female social worker supervises the case, and the Douglases speculate that Steve might marry the woman, to make the adoption possible, but they both agree this is not reason enough for them to be married. The family also does not need to hire a housekeeper, since Uncle Charley already has things running smoothly. The family soon appears before a judge who researches the law, and determines that its intent is to ensure a full-time caregiver is in the household. With Charley meeting that role, and having {{had a change of heart}} about Ernie, Charley assents to a legal fiction declaring him [...] "housemother" [...] to the Douglas family.|$|R
