2500|$|People in the United States {{work among}} the longest {{hours per week}} in the industrialized world, and have the least annual leave. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 article 24 states: [...] "Everyone {{has the right to}} rest and leisure, {{including}} reasonable limitation of working hours and periodic holidays with pay." [...] However, there is no general federal or state legislation requiring <b>paid</b> <b>annual</b> <b>leave.</b> Title 5 of the United States Code §6103 specifies ten public holidays for federal government employees, and provides that holidays will be paid. Many states do the same, however, no state law requires private sector employers to provide paid holidays. Many private employers follow the norms of federal and state government, but the right to annual leave, if any, will depend upon collective agreements and individual employment contracts. State law proposals have been made to introduce <b>paid</b> <b>annual</b> <b>leave.</b> A 2014 Washington Bill from United States House of Representatives member Gael Tarleton would have required a minimum of 3 weeks of paid holidays each year to employees in businesses of over 20 staff, after 3 years work. Under the International Labour Organization Holidays with Pay Convention 1970 three weeks is the bare minimum. The Bill did not receive enough votes. By contrast, employees in all European Union countries have the right to at least 4 weeks (i.e. 28 days) of <b>paid</b> <b>annual</b> <b>leave</b> each year. Furthermore, there is no federal or state law on limits to the length of the working week. Instead, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 §207 creates a financial disincentive to longer working hours. Under the heading [...] "Maximum hours", §207 states that time and a half pay must be given to employees working more than 40 hours in a week. It does not, however, set an actual limit, and there are at least 30 exceptions for categories of employee which do not receive overtime pay. Shorter working time was one of the labor movement's original demands. From {{the first decades of the}} 20th century, collective bargaining produced the practice of having, and the word for, a two-day [...] "weekend". State legislation to limit working time was, however, suppressed by the US Supreme Court in Lochner v New York. The New York State Legislature had passed the Bakeshop Act of 1895, which limited work in bakeries to 10 hours a day or 60 hours a week, to improve health, safety and people's living conditions. After being prosecuted for making his staff work longer in his Utica, Mr Lochner claimed that the law violated the Fourteenth Amendment on [...] "due process". Despite the dissent of four judges, a majority of five judges held that the law was unconstitutional. The whole Lochner era of jurisprudence was reversed by the US Supreme Court in 1937, but experimentation to improve working time rights, and [...] "work-life balance" [...] has not yet recovered.|$|E
2500|$|The first Borisov {{government}} also initiated administrative reform by cutting {{the number of}} ministries and agencies. Two ministries were subsumed by others already in November 2009. Next was the streamlining of government agencies. In 2010, a full list of these agencies was compiled – 122 in all. After a month's work, 30 were slated for closure. Here the reform team incurred the wrath of labor unions and ex-government officials, who {{at the same time}} argued that streamlining was necessary but these were the wrong [...] "victims." [...] The government moved ahead and within one year of the start of reforms the government payroll was reduced by 13,000 (out of 110,000 initially). Still, the number of government entities and bureaucrats remained higher than a decade earlier, which was the desired goal. The next step was to create a common salary and promotion structure for the whole administration, starting in 2011. Prior to that, a patchwork of nearly 90 separate laws regulated the pay of public officials {{in different parts of the}} government. As a result, some administrations were paid three times more than others, for comparable tasks and responsibilities. Some administrations had double the <b>paid</b> <b>annual</b> <b>leave</b> of others. Some had a bonus system in place; others paid out only fixed salaries. Putting all this into one law required significant work by Parliament - over 200 pieces of legislation had to be amended.|$|E

New Zealand also has 11 annual public holidays and an employee is entitled to these days off work on pay, if they are days when the employee would normally work.

2500|$|Just {{as there}} are no rights to <b>paid</b> <b>annual</b> <b>leave</b> or maximum hours, there are no rights to paid time off for child care or family leave in federal law. There are minimal rights in some states. Most {{collective}} agreements, and many individual contracts, provide paid time off, but employees who lack bargaining power will often get none. There are, however, limited federal rights to unpaid leave for family and medical reasons. The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 generally applies to employers of 50 or more employees in 20 weeks of the last year, and gives rights to employees who have worked over 12 months and 1250 hours in the last year. Employees can have up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for child birth, adoption, {{to care for a}} close relative in poor health, or because of an employee's own poor health. Child care leave should be taken in one lump, unless agreed otherwise. Employees must give notice of 30 days to employers if birth or adoption is [...] "foreseeable", and for serious health conditions if practicable. Treatments should be arranged [...] "so as not to disrupt unduly the operations of the employer" [...] according to medical advice. Employers must provide benefits during the unpaid leave. Under §2652(b) states are empowered to provide [...] "greater family or medical leave rights". In 2016 California, New Jersey, Rhode Island and New York had laws for paid family leave rights. Under §2612(2)(A) an employer can make an employee substitute the right to 12 unpaid weeks of leave for [...] "accrued paid vacation leave, personal leave or family leave" [...] in an employer's personnel policy. Originally the Department of Labor had a penalty to make employers notify employees that this might happen. However, five judges in the US Supreme Court in Ragsdale v Wolverine World Wide, Inc held that the statute precluded the right of the Department of Labor to do so. Four dissenting judges would have held that nothing prevented the rule, and it was the Department of Labor's job to enforce the law. After unpaid leave, an employee generally has the right to return to his or her job, except for employees who are in the top 10% of highest paid and the employer can argue refusal [...] "is necessary to prevent substantial and grievous economic injury to the operations of the employer." [...] Employees or the Secretary of Labor can bring enforcement actions, but there is no right to a jury for reinstatement claims. Employees can seek damages for lost wages and benefits, or the cost of child care, plus an equal amount of liquidated damages unless an employer can show it acted in good faith and reasonable cause to believe it was not breaking the law. There is a two-year limit on bringing claims, or three years for willful violations. Despite the lack of rights to leave, there is no right to free child care or day care. This has encouraged several proposals to create a public system of free child care, or for the government to subsize parents' costs.|$|E

30|$|According to the Federal Holidays Act (Bundesurlaubsgesetz), {{the minimum}} {{entitlement}} to paid recreational holiday is 20 working {{days per year}} based on a five-day work week. Many collective or individual agreements, however, include more favourable regulations. Overall, the <b>annual</b> <b>leave</b> entitlement for workers covered by collective agreements in Germany is six weeks per year (cf. Schnitzlein 2011). The Collective Agreement Archive of the WSI reports this collectively agreed <b>annual</b> <b>paid</b> holiday <b>leave</b> of employees, distinguishing basic and actual total leave by industries. Collective agreements can determine basic leave for an employee, which is then raised {{in one or more}} stages to the actual total leave. Requirements for an increase can be age, duration of affiliation with the enterprise, wage bracket, etc. Based on details provided by the WSI, basic and actual total leave are weighted on a  40 / 60 basis to obtain the overall leave, which is a plausible proportion also according to analyses of the GSOEP.|$|R
