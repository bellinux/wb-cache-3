[...] After a further delay of 25 minutes Dr Nandasena Amarasekera, the Force Medical Examiner, was called to examine Rigg, although CCTV later showed that custody sergeant PS Paul White misled the doctor by telling him that Rigg was [...] "feigning unconsciousness." [...] When the FME examined him again ten minutes later he found that his heart had stopped and he was not breathing. Although CPR was attempted, Rigg was officially pronounced dead after arriving at King's College Hospital, Southwark.|$|E
50|$|During your flight, {{you control}} {{every aspect of}} the bomber from each of the seven crew positions: Pilot, Front Gunner, Tail Gunner, Bomb Aimer, Navigator, Engineer, and Squadron Leader. Leaving any of these <b>positions</b> <b>unattended</b> during an event could spell the death of the person in that position, {{rendering}} it useless during further encounters. You must evade enemies, plan your approach, and set all of the variables (speed, height, timing, etc.) to execute a successful bombing. Sometimes, it becomes necessary to deal with emergencies, such as engine fires.|$|R
50|$|Don Francisco López de Zúñiga y Meneses, {{the second}} Marquis, was Royal Governor of Chile between 1639 and 1646. He {{was accused of}} {{allowing}} corruption to flourish, to let his <b>position</b> go <b>unattended</b> and of using it to enrich himself. He died fighting against the English on his return to Spain.|$|R
40|$|Electroencephalographic {{studies in}} humans have {{demonstrated}} that orienting of visual attention induces a decrease in oscillatory alpha-band activity (alpha-desynchronization) over cortical areas tuned to the attended visual space. This is interpreted as reflecting intentionally enhanced excitability of these areas to facilitate upcoming visual processing. However, the inverse mechanism might also apply. Brain areas that process task-irrelevant space might be actively suppressed by increased alpha-activity (alpha-synchronization) to protect against input of distracter information. In the present study, we demonstrate that such suppression mechanisms are highly selective and are taking place even without distracters {{that need to be}} ignored. During voluntary orienting of attention, we found alpha-synchronization to dominate over desynchronization, to be topographically specific for each of eight attention positions, and to occur over areas processing unattended space in a retinotopically organized pattern. This indicates that alpha-synchronization is an important component of selective attention, serving active suppression of <b>unattended</b> <b>positions</b> during visual spatial orienting...|$|R
40|$|Inhibition of {{irrelevant}} {{information and}} response tendencies {{is a central}} characteristic of conscious control and executive functions. However, recent theories in vision considered Inhibition of Return (IOR: slower responses to attended than <b>unattended</b> <b>positions)</b> to be a hallmark of automatic exogenous capture of visual attention by unconscious cues. In the present study, we show that an unconscious cue that exogenously captures attention {{does not lead to}} IOR. First of all, subliminal cues with a contrast different from a searched-for target contrast capture attention independently of their match of contrast polarity to the search criteria. This is found with a short cue-target interval (Exp. 1). However, the same cues do not lead to IOR with a long cue-target interval. The lack of IOR is also verified for several intermediate intervals (Exp. 2), for high-contrast cues and low-contrast targets (Exp. 3), and with lower luminance cues presented on a CRT screen (Exp. 4). Finally, no capture effect but IOR is found for consciously perceived anti-predictive cues (Exp. 5). Together the results support the notion of a double dissociation between IOR and exogenous capture and are in line with a decisive role of consciousness for inhibition...|$|R
40|$|Voluntarily {{directing}} visual {{attention to}} a cued position in space leads to improved processing of forthcoming visual stimuli at the attended position, and attenuated processing of competing stimuli elsewhere, due to anticipatory tuning of visual cortex activity. In EEG, recent evidence points to a determining role of modulations of posterior alpha-band activity (8 - 14 Hz) in such anticipatory facilitation (alpha-power decreases) versus inhibition (alpha-power increases). Yet, while such alpha-modulations are a common finding, the direction of modulation varies {{to a great extent}} across studies implying dependence on task demands. Here, we reveal opposite modulation of posterior alpha-power with early/initiation versus later/sustained processes of anticipatory attention orienting. Marked alpha-decreases were observed during shifting of attention (initial 700 ms) over occipito-parietal areas processing to-be-attended visual space, while alpha-increases dominated in the subsequent maintenance phase (> 700 ms) over occipito-parietal cortex tuned to <b>unattended</b> <b>positions.</b> Notably, the presence of alpha-modulation strongly depended on individual resting alpha-power. Overall, this provides further support to an active facilitative versus inhibitory role of alpha-power decreases and increases and suggests that these attention-related changes are differentially deployed during anticipatory attention orienting to prepare versus maintain the cortex for optimal target processing...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFor survival, it is {{necessary}} to attend quickly towards dangerous objects, but to turn away from something that is disgusting. We tested whether fear and disgust sounds direct spatial attention differently. Using fMRI, a sound cue (disgust, fear or neutral) was presented to the left or right ear. The cue was followed by a visual target (a small arrow) which was located on the same (valid) or opposite (invalid) side as the cue. Participants were required to decide whether the arrow pointed up- or downwards while ignoring the sound cue. Behaviorally, responses were faster for invalid compared to valid targets when cued by disgust, whereas the opposite pattern was observed for targets after fearful and neutral sound cues. During target presentation, activity in the visual cortex and IPL increased for targets invalidly cued with disgust, but for targets validly cued with fear which indicated a general modulation of activation due to attention. For the TPJ, an interaction in the opposite direction was observed, consistent with its role in detecting targets at <b>unattended</b> <b>positions</b> and in relocating attention. As a whole our results indicate that a disgusting sound directs spatial attention away from its location, in contrast to fearful and neutral sounds...|$|R
