The data is organized as parameters with one parameter being a one-, two- or three-dimensional floating <b>point</b> <b>array.</b> Several of these parameters may be combined to one time step. This allows to store five-dimensional arrays. Data can be written in single-precision (32 Bit), double-precision (64 Bit) or quadruple-precision (128 Bit). Geometry information for the different directions are saved in the header of the file. It is also possible to store additional information in user defined arrays there. With the file size being limited only by the computer itself (e.g. file system), EAS3 files are suitable for large simulations and thus for high-performance computing.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{application}} of Wireless LAN (WLAN) {{technology has evolved}} from specific vertical domains such as warehouses to both enterprises and homes. While use of WLANs in personal homes is reasonably successful, there are many challenging issues in enterprise-grade WLAN deployment, specifically, seamless mobility, high capacity, security, and quality of service (QoS) support for voice over IP (VoIP) applications. This dissertation proposes several practical techniques that successfully address these issues. To improve the availability and scalability of a WLAN AP, we proposed an access <b>point</b> <b>array</b> architecture that leverages multiple radio channels to increase the aggregate capacity, and employs a novel dynamic load balancing technique to equally distribute the capacity among mobile stations without requiring modifications on them. This access <b>point</b> <b>array</b> architecture improves a WLAN access network’s robustness because it can effectively address the bad fish problem. With IEEE 802. 11 i and IEEE 802. 1 x, most of the security problems associated with IEEE 802. 11 WLANs no longer exist. The major remaining security problem is denial-ofservice attacks that exploit the lack of authentication for management frames. We propose...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. An {{approach}} of calibration method for 3 D sensing {{scheme based on}} shifted <b>point</b> <b>array</b> encoding is presented. Initially a 3 D calibration benchmark is established in object space, the camera subsystem can be calibrated with the benchmark. The projection optics subsystem is bounded with camera subsystem in this sensing scheme so a constraint condition is imposed on both subsystems. Therefore {{it is possible to}} calibrated projection subsystem by introducing a concept of benchmark transmission. Once both subsystems have been calibrated, the 3 D coordinates of range image can be obtained with moderate accuracy. The coordinate difference between measured data and prescribed benchmark is used to define a square-error based objective function, leading to a non-linear equation. By solving this equation, one is able to determine the required parameters of the system configuration. Experiment results show that, after proposed calibration procedure, the 3 -D sensing scheme based on <b>point</b> <b>array</b> encoding is able to achieve such an accuracy as the standard deviation in X direction is 0. 29 mm, 0. 24 mm in Y direction, and 0. 29 mm in Z direction, respectively, for a measuring volume o...|$|E

40|$|With the {{enormous}} {{economies of scale}} of Wireless LAN (WLAN) hardware, the price of commodity WLAN access points has dropped to the level that is even cheaper than some WLAN adapters. In this paper we propose to put together an array of off-the-shelf access points, each operating at a different radio frequency, to build a super access point that can both scale up the overall sustained throughput and improve the robustness of WLAN connectivity {{in the presence of}} failures and denial-of-service attacks. The key enabling technology for the proposed access <b>point</b> <b>array</b> architecture is a dynamic load balancing mechanism that can adaptively adjust the association between stations and access points so as to distribute the traffic load among the array’s channels.

This observation was the departure point for Caspar-Klug’s theory in which the possible positions and orientations of the protein building blocks are predicted and classified in terms of T-numbers. Whilst this theory predicts the layouts of the protein containers, it provides no information on the thickness of the capsid or its surface features. The creation of icosahedrally invariant <b>point</b> <b>arrays</b> via affine extension of the icosahedral symmetry group and their mapping to viral capsids in [37] has shown that they provide geometrical constraints on viral structure that not only correlate positioning of proteins on the capsid, but also relate structural features on different radial levels including genome organisation.

40|$|An {{alternative}} to the single floating gate on a standard EEPROM device could be a continuous semi insulating layer in which the distribution of charge can be controlled. By partial oxidation of porous silicon, a new material named Oxide Passivated Nanocrystalline Silicon (OPNSi) is formed, which has embedded Si nanocrystals in a porous glass structure. With oxide barriers between silicon nanocrystals, carriers can be confined to the silicon crystallites or trapped at interface states {{on the surface of}} these nanocrystals. With the assistance of an electric field, carriers can undergo direct tunneling through the very thin barriers and alter the charge distribution within the OPNSi layer. The placement of charge within the layer will determine the field-effect on the underlying silicon substrate. A nondestructive read would take place at low control-gate bias, and possibly result in faster write/erase cycles compared to traditional EEPROM.

Three different process sequences for the phosphorus-diffused profiles {{on the front and}} back surfaces are depicted: One exhibits a shallow field, and two sequences have deeper, driven-in profiles. For realizing high efficiencies, such cell structures must meet several prerequisites, such as firing-stable front and rear passivations, and functional small screen-printed Al structures. Furthermore, it must be possible to create contacts on the Si surfaces using the driven-in P-profiles. With such a structure, cell efficiencies of 20. 0 % are reached. An analysis of the series resistance and area-weighted recombination is performed. The results are compared with the measured cell parameters.

40|$|The CARTOSAT 1 satellite, {{launched}} by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in 2005, can provide panchromatic alongtrack stereo imagery with a ground resolution of 2. 5 m. Along with the imagery, encrypted files with rational polynomial coefficients (RPCs) and meta-data are distributed by ISRO. The RPCs allow direct georeferencing within certain limits depending on the on-board systems for registering the orbit path and attitudes of the satellite. At the Cooperative Research Centre for Spatial Information at the University of Melbourne (Australia), the software package Barista for the processing of high-resolution satellite images is being developed. Barista offers three techniques for precise georeferencing of such image data, namely the 3 D affine model, bias correction for RPCs, and a generic pushbroom sensor model. The 3 D affine model can only be applied when ground control points (GCPs) are available. The RPC model can be improved {{beyond the limits of}} direct georeferencing by correcting for the biases contained in the original RPCs. This process requires at least one well-defined GCP per image. Whereas the meta-data for CARTOSAT 1 imagery do not contain all the information required for using the generic pushbroom sensor model for direct georeferencing, they provide initial values for such a sensor model to be determined if enough GCPs are available. In this paper, the authors compare the geopositioning accuracy achievable with CARTOSAT 1 imagery via the 3 D affine, bias-corrected RPC and generic pushbroom sensor models.

Specimens were sectioned and stained with haematoxylin-eosin, Masson trichrome, PAS, alcian blue-PAS, and orcein. The vessels were counted and the vascular area was calculated as a percentage in the lamina propria, in blind conditions, on PAS stained sections in 50 microscopic fields (magnification × 1000, 0. 02 mm 2 per field). The vascular area was calculated using the points counting procedure (Chalkley <b>point</b> <b>array).</b> The vascular morphology, intravascular cells, and the perivascular area were also studied using a magnification up to × 1200.  RESULTS—Patients with asthma had more vessels (mean (SD) 226. 70 (74. 53) v 172. 05 (30. 58), p= 0. 0043) and a larger percentage vascular area (8. 61 (2. 38) % v 6. 81 (2. 25) %, p= 0. 028) than non-asthmatic subjects. Patients with severe asthma had significantly more vessels than those with mild or moderate disease (p= 0. 0044). Asthmatic capillaries and venules had oedematous walls and thickening of the subendothelial basement membrane, and hypotrophic or atrophic myocytes and fibrosis in the arterioles. Vessels from asthmatic subjects showed eosinophil recruitment, activation, and intravascular lysis. Intense eosinophil recruitment was associated with more marked vascular structural changes. Muscular formations protruded into the lumen in the arterioles of both groups, and in asthmatics these had hypotrophic or atrophic myocytes and fibrosis.  CONCLUSIONS—Morphometric analysis showed that the bronchial lamina propria of asthmatic subjects had a larger number of vessels, occupying a larger percentage area than in non-asthmatic subjects. The number of vessels was correlated with the severity of the asthma. Marked alterations to the vascular structure appeared to be associated with intense eosinophil recruitment and intravascular activation. This is the first report of asthmatic and non-asthmatic bronchial wall specimens containing intra-arteriolar muscular formations, presumably to regulate blood flow to the capillary network and/or sinusoids. This function might be impaired when these structures are remodelled in asthmatic patients. ...|$|E
40|$|As {{military}} operations in urban environments become more numerous, the ability of combat units to communicate, jam enemy communications, or employ RF weapons within this environment must be evaluated. To perform this evaluation in a mission level model requires a capability to evaluate the contributions of both terrain and man-made structures (interior and exterior) to RF propagation. The present study is {{an analysis of the}} adequacy of a mission level model (EADSIM) to perform these RF propagation calculations in an urban environment. Three basic environments must be assessed. The first environment consists entirely of terrain, with no man-made features impacting propagation values. The second environment includes terrain, but also includes the contribution of solid structures with abrupt edges, which may obstruct/influence LOS paths. The third environment includes not only terrain and structures, but also contains structures with interior features which must be evaluated to determine the propagation levels within and around these structures. EADSIM was used as the model for evaluation in view of its suite of propagation tools which can be used for analysis of RF propagation between transmitters and receivers including terrain. To assess EADSIM's capability to perform in these environments, flat terrain maps with an obstruction were created to permit comparison of EADSIM's propagation models with analytical calculations and with measurements. Calculations from the Terrain Integrated Rough Earth Model (TIREM) and the Spherical Earth Knife Edge (SEKE) propagation models included within EADSIM showed that the ability of the models to calculate knife-edge diffraction agreed favorably with analytical values. The representation of multipath effects was less encouraging. SEKE only models multipath when Fresnel clearance exists. TIREM models multipath, but the cyclical characteristics of multipath are not represented, and only subtractive path loss is considered. Multipath is only evaluated along a 2 -D path in the vertical orientation. This precludes modeling propagation in the urban canyons of metropolitan areas, where horizontal paths are dominant. It also precludes modeling exterior to interior propagation. In view of the apparent inadequacy of urban propagation within mission level models, as evidenced by EADSIM, the study also attempts to address possible solutions to the problem. Correction of the sparsing techniques in both TIREM and SEKE models is recommended. Both SEKE and TIREM are optimized for DTED level 1 data, sparsed at 3 arc seconds resolution. This led to significant errors when map data was sparsed at higher or lower resolution. TIREM's errors would be significantly reduced if the 999 <b>point</b> <b>array</b> limit was eliminated. This would permit using interval sizes equal to the map resolution for larger areas. This same problem could be fixed in SEKE by changing the interval spacing from a fixed 3 arc second resolution ({approx} 93 meters) to an interval which is set at the map resolution. Additionally, the cell elevation interpolation method which TIREM uses is inappropriate for the man-made structures encountered in urban environments. Turning this method of determining height off, or providing a selectable switch is desired. In the near term, it appears that further research into ray-tracing models is appropriate. Codes such as RF-ProTEC, which can be dynamically linked to mission level models such as EADSIM, can provide the higher fidelity propagation calculations required, and still permit the dynamic interactions required of the mission level model. Additional research should also be conducted on the best methods of representing man-made structures to determine whether codes other than ray-trace can be used...|$|E
40|$|Cancer {{of the eye}} is a {{rare and}} {{challenging}} disease. Uveal melanoma is the most prevalent of ocular malignancies in adults, with Australia holding {{one of the highest}} rates of incidence worldwide. While rare, the consequences are serious and more often than not, the sufferer will incur vision loss as a result of treatment, or, in time, will face losing the eye. Brachytherapy using radioactive eye plaques is the preferred method of treatment for ocular melanoma, yielding the best results for the patient in terms of vision and survival. Currently, methods of plaque brachytherapy dosimetry are limited by the size and spatial resolution of detectors such as thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs), where steep dose gradients create significant challenges. It is not only the detector size but the complexity of source geometry that hinder accurate dosimetry further still. These limitations lead to incomplete dose distributions and inevitably, inaccurate treatment planning for the quality assurance of eye plaques before clinical use. Dose planning software for I- 125 plaque brachytherapy using the 15 mm ROPES plaque has been developed based on interpolation of data from the published dosimetric parameters of the Task Group No. 43 (TG 43) AAPM revised protocol (Rivard et al., 2004). This application includes the ability to export dose maps in the format of a 256 x 256 pixel array analogous to the output of the Medipix 2 silicon pixelated counting device recently used in physical measurements at the Centre for Medical Radiation Physics (CMRP). Using the Geant 4 photon transport toolkit, Monte Carlo dosimetry was performed for a single I- 125 model 6711 seed to optimise the dose rate distribution data calculated the software. Dose point data was obtained every millimetre up to 25 mm in the radial direction and every five degrees in polar angle. Similarly, Monte Carlo method was used to compare dose distributions for the Ru- 106 CCD plaque with those generated by the Plaque Simulator (BEBIG GmbH, Berlin, Germany). The cylindrical symmetry of the plaque allowed data to be obtained in toroids of radii in millimetre increments up to 25 mm, and depth from the plaque surface also in millimetre increments up to 25 mm. The results of the I- 125 simulation were used to calculate the TG 43 dosimetric parameters and were in good agreement with the published data. Radial dose functions over the scoring range fell within 3 % with a maximum deviation from TG 43 data of only 2. 8 % (occurring 1 mm away from the source on the plaque central axis). Anisotropy functions were obtained within 5 % uncertainty for all polar angles. The Ru- 106 plaque results differed considerably from the dose data generated by the Plaque Simulator withthe most significant deviation occurring at very small distances from the plaque inner surface (within 1 cm). Monte Carlo method is a useful technique for dosimetry of plaque brachytherapy sources used in the treatment of ocular melanoma. The Geant 4 toolkit is capable of accurately scoring dose at defined small radial distances from the source previously unaccounted for. The dose <b>point</b> <b>array</b> obtained for the model 6711 seed can be input into the dose planning software for dose optimisation and combined with the results of recent physical measurements using the Medipix 2, can achieve the quality assurance of eye plaque brachytherapy treatment...|$|E

We have developed an adaptive algorithm that continually calibrates an array of sensors that contains gain and offset variations. This papers extends the work of Ullman and Schechtman who developed an algorithm for for gain adjustment. 17 The adaptive nonlinear dynamical system can be mapped to analog VLSI or a discretized version may be efficiently implemented in digital hardware.

Introduction Transistor mismatches and parameter variations cause unavoidable nonuniformities in VLSI sensors. To counteract these variations between components, a one-time calibration procedure is normally used.
