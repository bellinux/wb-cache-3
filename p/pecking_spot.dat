50|$|Kelp gull chicks are {{stimulated by}} a red {{spot on the}} mother's beak to <b>peck</b> at the <b>spot</b> (pictured), which induces regurgitation.|$|R
500|$|The spot {{near the}} gonydeal expansion, in adults of many bird species but {{especially}} in gulls, usually reddish or orangish in colour, that triggers begging behaviour. Gull chicks, for example, <b>peck</b> at the <b>spot</b> on its parent's bill, {{which in turn}} stimulates the parent to [...] food.|$|R
25|$|The gonys is the ventral {{ridge of}} the lower mandible, created by the {{junction}} of the bone's two rami, or lateral plates. The proximal end of that junction—where the two plates separate—is known as the gonydeal angle or gonydeal expansion. In some gull species, the plates expand slightly at that point, creating a noticeable bulge; {{the size and shape}} of the gonydeal angle can be useful in identifying between otherwise similar species. Adults of many species of large gulls have a reddish or orangish gonydeal spot near the gonydeal expansion. This spot triggers begging behavior in gull chicks. The chick <b>pecks</b> at the <b>spot</b> on its parent's bill, which in turn stimulates the parent to regurgitate food.|$|R
40|$|Overexpression of the bacterio-opsin (bO) gene {{in tobacco}} had {{previously}} been shown to induce hypersensitiveresponse- like lesions, increase viral and bacterial disease resistance, and stimulate pathogenesis-related gene expression. To see if this gene enhanced resistance to fungal pathogens of poplar, we generated a total of 35 transgenic lines in two clones of Populus trichocarpa Torr. & A. Gray × Populus deltoides Bartr. ex Marsh. and one clone of P. trichocarpa × Populus nigra L. and challenged them with the fungal pathogens Melampsora occidentalis H. Jack (leaf rust), Venturia populina (Vuill.) Fabric. (leaf and shoot blight), Septoria musiva Peck, and Septoria populicola <b>Peck</b> (leaf <b>spot</b> and stem canker) in greenhouse, field, or laboratory inoculations. Northern analysis showed that the bO gene was expressed in the transgenic poplars; however, no increase in expression of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL 1) or two wound-inducible poplar chitinase genes (WIN 6 and WIN 8) were observed, even in one line that showed very high bO expression, intensive lesion development, and retarded growth. Poplars required a high threshold of bO expression for lesion development, and susceptibility {{to all of the}} pathogens tested was unaffected by bO overexpression...|$|R
6000|$|... 5. The fifth kind of {{property}} is representative property, consisting of documents or money, or rather documents only, for money itself {{is only a}} transferable document, current among societies of men, giving claim, at sight, to some definite benefit or advantage, most commonly to a certain share of real property existing in those societies. The money is only genuine when the property it gives claim to is real, or the advantages it gives claim to certain; otherwise, it is false money, and may be considered as much [...] "forged" [...] when issued by a government, or a bank, as when by an individual. Thus, if a dozen of men, cast ashore on a desert island, pick up a number of stones, put a red spot on each stone, and pass a law that every stone marked with a red spot shall give claim to a peck of wheat;--so long as no wheat exists, or can exist, on the island, the stones are not money. But the moment as much wheat exists as shall render {{it possible for the}} society always to give a <b>peck</b> for every <b>spotted</b> stone, the spotted stones would become money, and might be exchanged by their possessors for whatever other commodities they chose, to the value of the peck of wheat which the stones represented. If more stones were issued than the quantity of wheat could answer the demand of, the value of the stone coinage would be depreciated, in proportion to its increase above the quantity needed to answer it.|$|R
