50|$|The entire bank of Kukdi River {{is turned}} into moon land of huge <b>pot</b> <b>holes.</b> The {{phenomenon}} behind its formation {{goes back to}} more than thousands of years. The river flow wears out the vesicular basalt’s upper layer and compact basalt layer of the rock. Then small hard pebbles vigorously swirl in these wear out areas due to flow of the water to create circular <b>pot</b> <b>holes.</b> There is huge gorge or canyon created in the river due to the whirl effect of stones for the ages. These {{are believed to be}} the largest natural <b>pot</b> <b>holes</b> in Asia. It is very amazing and interesting place. You just have to see this miracle with your eyes to believe it. There is small temple of “Malganga” on the bank on this river.|$|R

The crag has been popular since the late 1970s/early 1980s and is often visited on the way to or from Snowdonia, when traveling from the North West of England. The quarry, and much of the Clwyd Area, was pioneered by Stuart Cathcart.

50|$|Limestone is {{partially}} soluble, especially in acid, and therefore forms many erosional landforms. These include limestone pavements, <b>pot</b> <b>holes,</b> cenotes, caves and gorges. Such erosion landscapes {{are known as}} karsts. Limestone is less resistant than most igneous rocks, but more resistant than most other sedimentary rocks. It is therefore usually associated with hills and downland, and occurs in regions with other sedimentary rocks, typically clays.|$|R
5000|$|Also {{located in}} Cimei, the Great Lion Scenic Area overlooks Longcheng (龍埕, [...] "shaped like a dragon").

Longcheng is an abrasion platform with <b>pot</b> <b>holes</b> and chessboard rocks.|$|R
