40|$|Abstract: We used an {{electrical}} cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) technique to measure {{changes in the}} <b>projected</b> <b>area</b> of individual cells. The <b>projected</b> <b>area</b> of the cell {{plays a significant role}} in cellular behavior, including cell spreading, cell growth, cell death and cell adhesion. We built a custom impedance sensing setup; we recorded real time impedance spectra of individual adherent cells; and we used two parameters extracted from each impedance spectrum to measure the changes in the <b>projected</b> <b>area</b> of the cell. The <b>projected</b> <b>area</b> of the cell determines how much electrical current was measured using ECIS; therefore, it directly governed the values of two extracted impedance parameters...|$|R
40|$|In 2009 {{an early}} runic {{inscription}} was discovered on a triangular <b>projecting</b> <b>area</b> that through subsequent excavation was confirmed {{to be at}} the lower part of a funerary monument. Yet such find reports and commentaries as have appeared to date have tended not to assess the Hogganvik inscription prin­ci­pally as a commemorative expression, {{as an example of a}} broader memo­rial epigraphic tradition. Rather than as an epigraphic record of the history of emotions, suggestions of magic appear in the main treatments of the remark­able find. After all, lexically irregular sequences found on other early runic memo­rials are often taken as signs they feature a magical aspect. Taking the Hoggan­vik inscription in its broader linguistic and archaeological context, how­ever, suggests a rather different understanding is to be assumed for the early Norwegian memorial. Instead of reflecting magic, the less clear sections of the Hoggan­vik text can more regularly be understood as abbreviated or other­wise obscurely expressed sequences...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMaturation of {{functional}} neuronal circuits during {{central nervous system}} development relies on sophisticated mechanisms. First, axonal and dendritic growth should reach appropriate targets for correct synapse elaboration. Second, pruning and neuronal death are required to eliminate redundant or inappropriate neuronal connections. Serotonin, {{in addition to its}} role as a neurotransmitter, actively participates in postnatal establishment and refinement of brain wiring in mammals. Brain resident macrophages, that is, microglia, also {{play an important role in}} developmentally regulated neuronal death as well as in synaptic maturation and elimination. Here, we tested the hypothesis of cross-regulation between microglia and serotonin during postnatal brain development in a mouse model of synaptic refinement. We found expression of the serotonin 5 -HT 2 B receptor on postnatal microglia, suggesting that serotonin could participate in temporal and spatial synchronization of microglial functions. Using two-photon microscopy, acute brain slices, and local delivery of serotonin, we observed that microglial processes moved rapidly toward the source of serotonin in Htr 2 B(+/+) mice, but not in Htr 2 B(-/-) mice lacking the 5 -HT 2 B receptor. We then investigated whether some developmental steps known to be controlled by serotonin could potentially result from microglia sensitivity to serotonin. Using an in vivo model of synaptic refinement during early brain development, we investigated the maturation of the retinal projections to the thalamus and observed that Htr 2 B(-/-) mice present anatomical alterations of the ipsilateral <b>projecting</b> <b>area</b> of retinal axons into the thalamus. In addition, activation markers were upregulated in microglia from Htr 2 B(-/-) compared to control neonates, in the absence of apparent morphological modifications. These results support the hypothesis that serotonin interacts with microglial cells and these interactions participate in brain maturation...|$|E
40|$|The axon {{degeneration}} following lesions in the dorsal lateral and posterior lateral thalamic nuclei {{of the cat}} was traced in serial sections impregnated by the Nauta-Gygax method. The following conclusions were drawn. 1. The dorsal {{lateral nucleus}} projects diffusely to the cortex of the middle and posterior suprasylvian gyri, {{the lower part of}} the posterolateral gyrus, the anterior and posterior limbic regions, the postsubicular area and the hippocampal fusiform gyrus. However, the severely degenerating cortical areas vary with the site of the lesions in the lateral dorsal nucleus. The anterior part of the dorsal lateral nucleus projects profusely to the anterior part of the above-mentioned cortex, while the posterior part of the nucleus has strong projection to the posterior part of the cortex. This indicates that the cortical projection of the dorsal lateral nucleus is organized essentially in a topical manner in the anteroposterior direction. 2. The cortical <b>projecting</b> <b>area</b> of the posterior lateral nucleus corresponds roughly to that of the dorsal lateral nucleus. In addition, it includes the anterior suprasylvian gyrus and the anterolateral part of the lateral gyrus, area 19. The heavily projecting areas, however, are limited to the anterior and middle suprasylvian gyri and the adjacent part of area 19 in the lateral gyrus, as well as the cortical part around the anterior part of the splenial sulcus. Moreover, the heaviest cortical projection of the posterior lateral nucleus to these cortical areas is organized in a topical manner in the anteroposterior dimension. The anterior part of the posterior lateral nucleus projects most profusely to the anterior part of the heavily projecting areas, while the posterior part of the nucleus has the most massive projetion to the posterior part of the areas. In all cases with lesions in the posterior lateral nucleus slight degeneration is found in the limited cortical part of the anterior sylvian gyrus. 3. It should be mentioned that the dorsal lateral and posterior lateral nuclei have diffuse projection to certain cortical areas, collectively called the association cortex, though their heavy projections are organized in a topical manner in the anteroposterior dimension...|$|E

40|$|Projection fibers {{from the}} visual cortex and {{adjacent}} regions, {{located in the}} lateral surface of the cerebral hemisphere in the cat, were studied with the Nauta staining technique. Following are conclusions gathered from this study: (1) The fine degenerated fibers distributing to the dorsal nucleus of the ipsilateral lateral geniculate body arise from the region corresponding to the striate area. Within this regions, fibers from the anterior lateral gyrus project to the anterior half of the dorsal nucleus, and those from the posterior lateral gyrus to the posterior half, respectively. These fibers are traced through the antero-dorsal margin of the dorsal nucleus to the postero-ventral direction, and terminate in the lamina A receiving the crossed optic preterminals, and also, in the lamina A_I related to the uncrossed ones. However, it remains uncertain as to whether there are terminal arborizations within the lamina B itself. (2) The projecting fibers to the stratum opticum and the superficial grey stratum of the superior colliculus originate in the homolateral striate and parastriate areas: There is {{a high degree of}} organization in the projection from the cortex upon the superior colliculus. That is to say, the anterior lateral gyrus is related to the lateral part of the superior colliculus and the occipital polar part to the intermediate part; the posterior lateral and posterior suprasylvian gyri project exclusively to the medial part of the superior cnlliculus. (3) The cortico-tectal fibers mentioned above give off the preterminal fibers mainly to the pretectal nucleus in their passage through the pretectal nuclear complex. (4) The <b>projecting</b> <b>area</b> to the pulvinar nucleus, composed of the posterior lateral and posterior suprasylvian gyri, the posterior half of the middle suprasylvian gyrus, and the posterior one third of the anterior lateral gyrus, is overlapped with the greater part of the visual cortex consisting of the striate and parastriate areas. (5) An area contributing the preterminal fibers to the ventral nucleus of the lateral geniculate body is considerably {{similar to that of the}} pulvinar nucleus, but does not contain the anterior lateral gyrus in its field. (6) An area related to the posterior lateral nucleus of the thalamus is restricted to the middle suprasyluian and anterior lateral gyri and is overlapped with the anterior portion of the visual cortex. (7) The projecting fibers to the caudate and pontine nuclei arise from the parastriate area located in the anterior lateral gyrus, but, not from the striate area...|$|E

40|$|There are {{instances}} {{in which it is}} desirable to determine relationships among fruit physical attributes. For example, fruits are often graded on the basis of size and <b>projected</b> <b>area,</b> but it may be more economical to develop a machine which would grade by mass or volume. Therefore, the relationships between mass/volume (either mass or volume) and other physical attributes of fruit are needed. In this study three Iranian varieties of tangerine were selected and the various models for predicting mass/volume of tangerine from its dimensions, <b>projected</b> <b>area,</b> and volume/mass were established. The models were divided into three classifications: 1 &# 8211; single and multiple variable regressions of tangerine dimensions, 2 &# 8211; single and multiple variable regressions of <b>projected</b> <b>areas,</b> 3 &# 8211; estimating tangerine mass/volume based on its volume/mass. The results revealed that mass and volume modelling on the basis of intermediate diameter, on any <b>projected</b> <b>area,</b> and the measured volume are the best models. Based on the results, mass and volume modelling, respectively {{on the basis of the}} actual volume and one <b>projected</b> <b>area,</b> were identified as the best models. The highest determination coefficient in all the models was obtained for volume modelling based on <b>projected</b> <b>area</b> as R 2 = 0. 97.
