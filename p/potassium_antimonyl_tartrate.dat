40|$|Fundamental {{objective}} of the present doctoral thesis {{is the study of}} phosphorus behavior in the sediments of Louros river. This region constitutes an interesting case since it includes a number of water biotopes, protected by the Ramsar treaty, as well as some areas of intense productive activity. For the study of phosphorus in the sediments the fractionation method of Hedley was applied, which provides valid information with regard to the vioavailability of phosphorus. The application of this method showed that the phosphorous fraction found in higher percentages in the sediments are apatites. For the determination of various forms of phosphorus, an analytical procedure was followed which includes the transformation of phosphorus species in dissolved orthophosphate and the spectrophotometrical determination of dissolved orthophosphate. The determination of orthophosphate was performed according to the method of Murphy and Riley, based on the phosphomolybdenum blue complex, in the presence of <b>antimonyl</b> <b>tartrate</b> to fasten the color development. In an effort to monitor orthophosphate, an analytical methodology was established owing to the need for interference-free determination at the low mg/L levels. This method is based on the reaction of orthophosphate with molybdate towards a yellow heteropoly acid complex, which is electrically balanced with a cationic surfactant (cetylatrimethylammonium bromide) towards a complex non-polar derivative. This derivative is conveniently solubilized in the micelles of a non-ionic surfactant under mild conditions and measured spectrophotometrically at 370 nm after its uptake with a sulfuric acid-methanol solution. The control of representativity of the results of fractionation and determination of various forms of phosphorus was achieved with an extensive determination of errors that arise during the inquiring effort. The total error, in the form of relative standard deviation, amount about 20 %. The method of speciation of the fractionation of phosphorus that was applied, provided conclusions with regard to the levels of pollution from phosphorus, the nature of inputs (natural and not natural) and the type of sources of phosphorus (point and non-point) that affects each region. Also, a range from other physicochemical parameters of sediments were determined, in order to check their interactions with the various types and fractions of phosphorus. In this effort, a combination of parametric and non-parametric explanatory statistical procedures were deployed in order to unravel the intricate P patterns throughout the river and elucidate the interactions between natural occurring processes and anthropogenic influence on its concentration and bioavailability. More specific the results of this inquiring effort shows that the concentrations of P in Louros sediments indicate relatively moderate accumulation, especially of inorganic forms, along the river although several sources that could maintain an elevated concentration profile are present. The sampling points of fishfarms and Saint George are the most heavily loaded with phosphorus while the sampling point of Amvrakikos gulf presents the lowest P burden. ...|$|R

We present our studies on Leishmania infantum amastigote parasites selected for resistance to <b>potassium</b> <b>antimonyl</b> <b>tartrate</b> [Sb(III) ]. Inside macrophages, the Sb(III) -selected cells are cross-resistant to sodium stibogluconate (Pentostam), the main drug used against Leishmania.

The expression of three genes coding for the ABC transporter MRPA (PGPA), S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, and folylpolyglutamate synthase was found to be consistently increased. The levels of cysteine were found to be increased in the mutant. Transfection of the MRPA gene was shown to confer sodium stibogluconate resistance in intracellular parasites.

40|$|Antimony-containing {{drugs are}} still the drugs of choice in the {{treatment}} of infections caused by the parasite Leishmania. Resistance to antimony is now common {{in some parts of the}} world, and several mechanisms of resistance have been described. By transfecting cosmid banks and selecting with <b>potassium</b> <b>antimonyl</b> <b>tartrate</b> (SbIII), we have isolated a cosmid associated with resistance. This cosmid contains 2 copies of the heat shock protein 70 (HSP 70) and 1 copy of the heat shock cognate protein 70 (HSC 70). Several data linked HSP 70 to antimony response and resistance. First, several Leishmania species, both as promastigotes and amastigotes, increased the expression of their HSP 70 proteins when grown in the presence of 1 or 2 times the Effect Concentration 50 % of SbIII. In several mutants selected for resistance to either SbIII or to the related metal arsenite, the HSP 70 proteins were found to be overexpressed. This increase was also observed in revertant cells grown for several passages in the absence of SbIII, suggesting that this increased production of HSP 70 is stable. Transfection of HSP 70 or HSC 70 in Leishmania cells does not confer resistance directly, though these transfectants were better able to tolerate a shock with SbIII.

The ability of axenically cultured amastigote organisms to be used in an investigation of antileishmanial agents was first evaluated.

The free radical characteristic of NO prevented direct induction of resistance in Leishmania wild-type parasites. Starting from the previous observation that antimony-resistant amastigotes of Leishmania infantum were not affected by NO-induced apoptotic death, we used a continuous NO pressure protocol and succeeded in inducing NO resistance in amastigote forms of L. infantum. Two clones resistant to 50 mu M (LiNOR 50) and 100 mu M (LiNOR 100) of the NO donor DETA/NONOate, derived from parental clone weakly resistant to trivalent antimony (LiSbIIIR 4), were selected and analysed. Both clones were also resistant to other NO donors, particularly SNAP In the absence of <b>potassium</b> <b>antimonyl</b> <b>tartrate,</b> all clones (LiSbIIIR 4, LiNOR 50 and LiNOR 100) lost their antimony resistance almost totally. Interestingly, the parasitic developmental life cycle of NO-resistant mutants was dramatically disturbed.

Nevertheless, NO-resistant amastigotes produce a maximal number of parasites 1. 5 - 2 times lower than the wild-type whereas, after differentiation, NO-resistant promastigotes produced more cells than the wild-type.

Several conditions for optimization of the in vitro metacyclogenesis and cell infectivity of Leishmania donovani, L. guyanensis, and L. braziliensis field strains obtained from patients receiving standard antimony medication were investigated. Triggering log-phase promastigotes to become amastigote-like by increasing the temperature or acidifying the culture medium was not successful. Adequate metacyclogenesis and {{the highest levels of}} macrophage infection were obtained after 5 -day-old late-log-phase promastigote cultures were preconditioned at 25 Â°C to pH 5. 4 for 24 h in Schneider's medium prior to infection.

All strains were sensitive to miltefosine (50 % inhibitory concentration [IC 50] < 10 Î¼M) and PX- 6518 (IC 50 < 2 Î¼g/ml) but showed distinct susceptibility to SbV and/or SbIII, depending on whether they were derived from cured, relapse, or nonresponder patients. Within the available set of Leishmania species and strains, simultaneous SbV-SbIII resistance was clearly associated with treatment failure; however, a larger set of isolates is still needed to judge the predictive value of SbV-SbIII susceptibility profiling on treatment outcome.

40|$|Schistosomes are {{parasitic}} platyhelminths {{that constitute}} an important {{public health problem}} globally. Infection {{is characterized by the}} presence of adult worms within the vasculature of their hosts, where they can reside for many years. The worms are covered by an unusual dual lipid bilayer through which they import nutrients. How the parasites import other vital molecules, such as water, is not known. Recent proteomic analysis of the schistosome tegumental membranes revealed the presence of an aquaporin homologue at the host-interactive surface whose cDNA we have cloned and characterized. The cDNA encodes a predicted 304 -aa protein (SmAQP) that is found largely in the parasite tegument by immunolocalization and is most highly expressed in the intravascular life stages. Treatment of parasites with short interfering RNAs targeting the SmAQP gene results in potent (> 90 %) suppression. These suppressed parasites resist swelling when placed in hypotonic medium, unlike their control counterparts, which rapidly double in volume. In addition, SmAQP-suppressed parasites, unlike controls, resist shrinkage when incubated in hyperosmotic solution. While suppressed parasites exhibit lower viability in culture relative to controls and exhibit a stunted appearance following prolonged suppression, they are nonetheless more resistant to killing by the drug <b>potassium</b> <b>antimonyl</b> <b>tartrate</b> (PAT). This is likely because SmAQP acts as a conduit for this drug, as is the case for aquaporins in other systems.

We report that amastigotes of Leishmania infantum cultured under axenic conditions were poorly susceptible to meglumine [Glucantime; an Sb(V) ], unlike those growing inside THP- 1 cells (50 % inhibitory concentrations [IC 50 s], about 1. 8 mg/ml and 22 Î¼g/ml, respectively). In order to define more precisely the mode of action of Sb(V) agents in vivo, we first induced in vitro Sb(III) resistance by direct drug pressure on axenically grown amastigotes of L. infantum. Then we determined the susceptibilities of both extracellular and intracellular chemoresistant amastigotes to the Sb(V) -containing drugs meglumine and sodium stibogluconate plus m-chlorocresol (Pentostam). The chemoresistant amastigotes LdiR 2, LdiR 10, and LdiR 20 were 14, 26, and 32 times more resistant to Sb(III), respectively, than the wild-type one (LdiWT). In accordance with the hypothesis described above, we found that intracellular chemoresistant amastigotes were resistant to meglumine [Sb(V) ] in proportion to the initial level of Sb(III) -induced resistance. By contrast, Sb(III) -resistant cells were very susceptible to sodium stibogluconate. This lack of cross-resistance is probably due to the presence in this reagent of m-chlorocresol, which we found to be more toxic than Sb(III) to L. infantum amastigotes (IC 50 s, of 0. 54 and 1. 32 Î¼g/ml, respectively). Collectively, these results were consistent with the hypothesis of an intramacrophagic metabolic conversion of Sb(V) into trivalent compounds, which in turn became readily toxic to the Leishmania amastigote stage...|$|E

Interestingly, drugs used for treating other non-infectious conditions including verteporfin, oltipraz, pyroglutamic acid, pidolic acid, and dextrorphan tartrate, that act on the glutathione/Î³-glutamyl pathway involved in protection against free radical damage, and also the antidepressant drug indatraline, were found to have high activity against stationary phase B. burgdorferi. Among the active hits, agents that affect cell membranes, energy production, and reactive oxygen species production are more active against the B. burgdorferi persisters than the commonly used antibiotics that inhibit macromolecule biosynthesis. Future studies are needed to evaluate and optimize the promising active hits in drug combination studies in vitro and also in vivo in animal models. These studies may have implications for developing more effective treatments of Lyme disease...|$|E
