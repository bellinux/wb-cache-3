5|$|Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine {{first used}} {{camouflage}} in the 1940 Norwegian campaign. A {{wide range of}} patterns were authorised, but most commonly black and white diagonal stripes were used. Most patterns were designed to hide ships in harbour or near the coast; they were often <b>painted</b> <b>over</b> with plain grey when operating in the Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|In 1959, Fox {{cast her}} in two {{independent}} gangster films filmed in the United Kingdom: The Challenge and Too Hot to Handle. Both films were low-budget, and their American releases were delayed. Too Hot to Handle was not {{released in the}} United States until 1961 (as Playgirl After Dark), and The Challenge in 1963 (as It Takes a Thief). In the United States, censors objected to a scene in Too Hot to Handle where Mansfield, wearing silver netting with sequins <b>painted</b> <b>over</b> her nipples, appeared nearly nude.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, {{she began}} {{painting}} pictures of each Tennessee Walking Horse {{to win the}} breed's World Grand Championship, held annually {{as part of the}} Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration. Nipper's first World Grand Champion portrait was of that year's winner Shades of Carbon, and his trainer Judy Martin. In all, she <b>painted</b> <b>over</b> 30 World Grand Champions, the last one before her death being I Am Jose.|$|E
5|$|Take Off (1944) – a {{large and}} complex group {{portrait}} of the four-man crew of a Short Stirling bomber, deep in concentration, preparing for a flight, which Knight <b>painted</b> <b>over</b> several months at RAF Mildenhall. Knight lived in the WAAF Officers' Mess while on the base, and the RAF gave her {{the use of an}} obsolete Stirling to work in while preparing the painting. When Knight learned that the navigator in the picture, Raymond Frankish Escreet, had been killed in action, she arranged that his family received a photograph of the painting.|$|E

5|$|The Wrestlers is an oil {{painting}} on millboard by English artist William Etty, painted around 1840 and {{currently in the}} York Art Gallery. It depicts a wrestling match between a black man and a white man, both glistening with sweat and under an intense light emphasising their curves and musculature. While little documentation of the painting exists prior to 1947, {{it is likely that}} it was <b>painted</b> <b>over</b> a period of three evenings at the life class of the Royal Academy.|$|E
5|$|The panel {{comprises}} four individual {{pieces of}} oak, <b>painted</b> <b>over</b> a chalk ground bound with glue. The preparation wood is dated to around 1410, giving an estimated {{date for the}} Van der Weyden in the mid-1430s. The dominant pigments are lead white (often used in the panel to highlight blue and green passages), charcoal black, ultramarine, lead-tin-yellow, verdigris and red lake. There has been some discolouration– some greens are now brown, including pigments used to depict grass in the background.|$|E
5|$|X-ray {{analysis}} {{shows that there}} were a few preparatory drawings made with chalk before the paint was applied. This is left exposed in some areas, most noticeably in the Virgin's veil and mantle and in Christ's shroud. Infrared photography reveals little underdrawing but shows that the canvas underwent several changes before it was completed; Mary Salome was repositioned slightly to the left, the sizes of Nicodemus' arm and shoulder were reduced, and the Magdalen's face was <b>painted</b> <b>over</b> the Virgin's mantle.|$|E
40|$|For mural {{communities}} in Surabaya, seizing walls to paint on is like conquering power over a territory. To <b>paint</b> <b>over</b> each others works {{that leads to}} verbal or physical conflicts can occur from a situation of rivalry between the mural communities or conflicts with the graffiti communities. Although conflicts can happen, interestingly {{there is still a}} sense of respect that conjures up guilt when they <b>paint</b> <b>over</b> other communities murals. <b>Painting</b> <b>over</b> others works in street art is common because it is in open space. Walls, in the street art communitys perspective, can become public space when the buildings structure faces the publicly accessible streets. This research aims to understand the strategies of the mural {{communities in}} creating works in Surabaya streets, especially when they must fight for a wall. Communities like Bunuhdiri, Tiadaruang, Horrorcrew, Artpuccino, and HateHate are invited in focus group discussions to talk about strategies, conflicts, and their understanding of public sphere. These mural communities still maintain local values, such as tolerance and permission from other communities when <b>painting</b> <b>over</b> their works, {{in the midst of the}} customary act of <b>painting</b> <b>over</b> others street art, just as with street art communities in developed countries that have been the exemplar of street art in Indonesia as well as Surabaya...|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} {{alterations}} are {{visible to the}} naked eye as pentimenti. A piece of paper draped over the edge of the table is clearly visible in outline, despite having been <b>painted</b> <b>over</b> with detailing of the table itself. Sigismunda's index finger which was bent towards and perhaps touching the heart has been straightened, but the outline of the tip is still visible on the surface of the heart. A looped cord in the top right-hand corner is poorly concealed under the topmost layer of paint. It is also known that, to attempt to appease critics, Hogarth repainted the fingers of Sigismunda so that the blood that was previously there would no longer be visible.|$|E
5|$|After {{the guns}} were fired, each rifle barrel {{had to be}} cleaned. Unlike small caliber guns which can be field-stripped, the guns aboard an Iowa-class {{battleship}} could not be disassembled, so the gunners mates assigned the job of cleaning the rifles required a full day or more {{to ensure that the}} barrels were correctly and adequately cleaned. To clean the rifles, a bore brush was lifted by two sailors and inserted into the gun barrel, where it was pulled through the rifle with the same equipment used to load the shells. Within the turret, crewmen checked to ensure that the breech fittings were properly cleaned and lubricated, while sailors outside the turret scraped off soot, and <b>painted</b> <b>over</b> flash burns left from the explosive expulsion of the 16-inch shells from the gun barrels.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} other Black Paintings, Goya began with a black {{background}} which he <b>painted</b> <b>over</b> with lighter pigments, then with broad, heavy brushstrokes of grey, blue and brown. The darker areas were achieved by leaving the black under-paint exposed; this is most obvious in {{the figure of the}} Devil. Like the other works in the series, Witches' Sabbath is worked up through heavy, slashing brushstrokes. The plaster was underlaid with thick carbon black before the paint was applied in hues of white lead, Prussian blue, vermilion of mercury, and crystals of powdered glass, orpiment and iron oxides. He likely worked with mixed materials. Technical analysis indicates that most of the Black Paintings begun with preparatory drawings. Witches' Sabbath is the exception; the final composition seems to have been painted directly onto the wall.|$|E

5|$|Cannon {{recovered}} from the sea are often extensively damaged from exposure to salt water; because of this, electrolytic reduction treatment is required to forestall the process of corrosion. The cannon is then washed in deionized water to remove the electrolyte, and is treated in tannic acid, which prevents further rust and gives the metal a bluish-black colour. After this process, cannons on display may be protected from oxygen and moisture by a wax sealant. A coat of polyurethane may also be <b>painted</b> <b>over</b> the wax sealant, to prevent the wax-coated cannon from attracting dust in outdoor displays.|$|E
5|$|Inside the church, an {{intricate}} five-tier icon screen funded by Hetman Pavlo Skoropadsky and executed by Hryhoryi Petriv from Chernigov {{was installed in}} 1718. During {{the eighteenth and nineteenth}} centuries, almost all of the original Byzantine mosaics and frescoes on the interior walls were <b>painted</b> <b>over.</b> Some restoration work on the mosaics and frescoes that remained unpainted was carried out {{towards the end of the}} nineteenth century. However, there were no major and serious investigations of the walls done, so it is possible that medieval frescoes or mosaics were preserved under the newer coats of plaster.|$|E
5|$|Olga escaped revolutionary Russia {{with her}} second husband and their two sons in February 1920. They joined her mother, the Dowager Empress, in Denmark. In exile, Olga acted as {{companion}} and secretary to her mother, and was often sought out by Romanov impostors {{who claimed to be}} her dead relatives. She met Anna Anderson, the best-known impostor, in Berlin in 1925. After the Dowager Empress's death in 1928, Olga and her husband purchased a dairy farm in Ballerup, near Copenhagen. She led a simple life: raising her two sons, working on the farm and painting. During her lifetime, she <b>painted</b> <b>over</b> 2,000 works of art, which provided extra income for both her family and the charitable causes she supported.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the centuries}} the frescoes were greatly altered and damaged. In 1746 the upper levels were <b>painted</b> <b>over</b> {{by the artist}} Vincenzo Meucci, {{covering}} up most of Masolino's work. Then, in 1771, the church was ruined by fire. The Brancacci Chapel, though structurally undamaged by the fire, suffered great damages to its frescoes. It {{was not until the}} years 1981–1990 that a full-scale restoration of the chapel was undertaken, restoring the frescoes to approximately their original state. The paintings had suffered some irreparable damage though, particularly the parts that were painted a secco: in The Tribute Money, the leaves on the trees were gone, while Christ's robe had lost much of its original azure brilliance.|$|E
5|$|The Kuching Orangutan Murals {{are vital}} {{images of a}} {{wheelbarrow}} filled with eight young orangutans and another baby orangutan swinging from a pipe. It was painted by Ernest Zacharevic along Power Street in the city on 27 April 2014. This latest mural is painted in Zacharevic's usual interactive style, with an actual wheelbarrow sliced into half and secured to the wall to enable the public to take selfies while holding onto the handle. On the other hand, the baby orangutan was <b>painted</b> <b>over</b> a nail on the wall, where people can 'place' items in its hand.|$|E
5|$|The park {{district}} {{does not}} appear to have moved the carousel after taking over in 1945, as a 1955 newspaper article noted it was still in the same spot it had occupied for 38years. The carousel was again operated as a concession within the park, this time by the wife of Everett DuBois, the park superintendent. Like Hubbs, Mrs. DuBois operated the carousel for almost 10years. Although the district did not change the ride's location, it noted in 1955 that the equipment was showing its age. In 1955 the park district attempted to paint over the oil paintings on the canopy, which had deteriorated. The Indianapolis Art League objected, and volunteered to restore the original paintings rather than have them <b>painted</b> <b>over</b> with Disney characters.|$|E
30|$|Shen Kuo [36] {{explained}} {{that there were}} a number of methods to correct writing errors: (1) scrapping (which damages the paper); (2) glue a piece of paper over the writing (which has the disadvantage of potential detachment); (3) <b>painting</b> <b>over</b> with a white paint fen (粉) (which has the disadvantage of not having a high hiding power and multiple layers would be needed); (4) <b>paint</b> <b>over</b> with orpiment (which has the best hiding power and one layer would be sufficient). Finally he stated that this was the reason why ancients prefer qian huang (铅黄 or literally ‘lead yellow’) for <b>painting</b> <b>over</b> error. In the context, one would assume that this meant a lead white and orpiment mixture, but massicot is also commonly referred to as qian huang.|$|R
