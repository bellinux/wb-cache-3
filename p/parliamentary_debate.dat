5|$|The {{issue of}} the {{constitutionality}} of this restriction has not yet arisen in any Singapore court, but during a <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>debate</b> in May 2001, Non-constituency Member of Parliament J.B. Jeyaretnam challenged the provision as unconstitutional.|$|E
5|$|A <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>debate</b> {{and motion}} to censure the Labour {{government}} on this {{was set for}} 8 October, but before this MacDonald called Hastings {{into his office and}} suggested a way to solve the problem. Hastings would accept all the blame and resign as Attorney General, and in exchange MacDonald {{and the rest of the}} cabinet would speak for Hastings at the resulting by-election. Hastings refused the general suggestion, but planned to make a speech at the upcoming debate explaining his actions.|$|E
5000|$|The Union {{is notable}} for its five annual <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Debates.</b> This format {{is unique to}} the Union, {{involving}} an Afternoon Session and an Evening Session of five rounds each. GUU Parliamentaries {{are not to be}} confused with the British <b>Parliamentary</b> style of <b>debating.</b> <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>debates</b> currently involve five (fictitous) clubs: the Scottish Nationalist Association, Her Majesty's Loyal Tory Club, the Whigs Club, the Independent Socialists and The World Almighty Distributist League. During <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>debates,</b> speakers are referred to by Parliamentary names, assigned to them akin to [...] "constituencies", but usually of a humorous nature.|$|R

5|$|A thin {{conception}} {{of the rule of}} law has generally been adopted by the Singapore Government and Members of Parliament from the ruling People's Action Party, as evidenced from the views expressed during a 1999 <b>parliamentary</b> <b>debate</b> on the rule of law. However, a thicker conception was evinced by the Minister for Law in a speech made during the 2009 seasonal meeting of the New York State Bar Association's International Section in Singapore. On the other hand, a thick {{conception of}} the rule of law that encompasses human rights has been adopted by a number of Government critics, including opposition politicians, and foreign and international organizations such as Human Rights Watch, Lawyers' Rights Watch Canada and the World Justice Project.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{political}} satire, the film received {{a positive response}} from the government of Singapore. Goh Chok Tong, then Prime Minister of Singapore, commended Jack Neo's creative talent during his National Day Rally address on 18 August 2002. In 2004, Neo was the first local film-maker to receive a National Day Award, and on 21 October 2005, he and Dick Lee became the first pop culture artists to receive the Cultural Medallion, Singapore's highest arts award. The movie sparked public discussion and <b>parliamentary</b> <b>debate</b> about {{the negative effects of}} streaming. In 2004, the Ministry of Education decided to merge the EM1 and EM2 streams, and on 29 September 2006, it announced that the EM3 stream will be scrapped by 2008.|$|E
5|$|During the 2009 <b>parliamentary</b> <b>debate</b> on {{the right}} to vote's status, Thio Li-ann {{proposed}} that, to avoid doubt, the right should be specifically set out in the Constitution. She argued that entrenching the right to vote through an Article in the Constitution would provide the opportunity to protect the details of the right. Currently, voting is regulated by the PEA. As it is an ordinary statute, it can be altered with a simple parliamentary majority by future governments seeking to amend or restrict voting rights. Thio said that expressing the right to vote clearly in the Constitution would allow aspects of that right such as voter secrecy and the universality and equality of votes to be protected from unjust manipulation.|$|E

5|$|Editorials by AlterNet, The Montreal Gazette, The Wall Street Journal, The Guardian, and The New York Times {{have accused}} Wilders of {{hypocrisy}} given that, in their view, Wilders {{has called for}} the ban of {{the sale of the}} Quran while simultaneously arguing for his own personal freedom of speech. In a speech during a Dutch <b>parliamentary</b> <b>debate,</b> Wilders elaborated that he calls for the consistent application of Dutch laws restricting any act of expression that incites violence. Ideally, he would prefer to see nearly all such laws abolished. As such, he supports a European-wide constitutional protection of freedom of speech like that which exists in the United States.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, {{debate for}} an {{official}} Canadian flag intensified {{and became a}} subject of controversy, culminating in the Great Flag Debate of 1964. In 1963, the minority Liberal government of Lester B. Pearson gained power and decided to adopt an official Canadian flag through <b>parliamentary</b> <b>debate.</b> The principal political proponent of the change was Pearson. He had been a significant broker during the Suez Crisis of 1956, {{for which he was}} awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. During the crisis, Pearson was disturbed when the Egyptian government objected to Canadian peacekeeping forces {{on the grounds that the}} Canadian flag (the Red Ensign) contained the same symbol (the Union Flag) also used as a flag by the United Kingdom, one of the belligerents. Pearson's goal was for the Canadian flag to be distinctive and unmistakably Canadian. The main opponent to changing the flag was the leader of the opposition and former prime minister, John Diefenbaker, who eventually made the subject a personal crusade.|$|E
5|$|Howe's {{impatience with}} the {{necessity}} for <b>parliamentary</b> <b>debate</b> of his proposals won him few friends, and he was often accused of dictatorial conduct by the Opposition. As the Liberal government entered its third decade, it and Howe {{came to be seen}} as arrogant. The Government's attempt to impose closure in the 1956 Pipeline Debate led to major controversy in the House of Commons. In the 1957 election, Howe's actions and policies were made an issue by Opposition leader John Diefenbaker. Howe faced a serious challenge in his riding, but was expected to make speeches elsewhere as a major Liberal leader. Howe lost his seat in the election, and Diefenbaker became Prime Minister, ending almost 22years of Liberal rule. Howe returned to the private sector, accepting a number of corporate directorships. The former minister died suddenly {{of a heart attack in}} December 1960.|$|E

5|$|The {{right to}} vote in Singapore is not {{explicitly}} stated in Singapore's Constitution, but the Government has expressed the view {{that it may be}} inferred from the fact that Singapore is a representative democracy and from specific constitutional provisions, including Articles 65 and 66 which set out requirements for the prorogation and dissolution of Parliament and the holding of general elections. Speaking on the matter in Parliament in 2009, the Minister for Law, K. Shanmugam, said that the {{right to vote}} could not be a mere privilege as this would imply the existence of an institution superior to the body of citizens that is empowered to grant such a privilege, but that no such institution exists in a free country. In 1966 a Constitutional Commission chaired by Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin advocated entrenching the right to vote within the Constitution, but this was not taken up by the Parliament of the day. When this proposal was repeated during the 2009 <b>parliamentary</b> <b>debate,</b> the Government took the view that such entrenchment was unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|During {{her maiden}} speech on 17 May 1999, Lamont {{was the first}} MSP to use Gaelic at a sitting of the Parliament. She served {{on a number of}} the Parliament's {{committees}} during her first term in office, including the Equal Opportunities Committee, the Local Government Committee and the Social Justice Committee. She became convener of the Social Justice Committee in 2001. In 2000 she became the first Labour MSP to rebel against the Labour-led administration when she threatened to lead backbenchers in voting against a planned Scottish Executive attempt to block the Abolition of Poindings and Warrant Sales Bill, which had been introduced by Sheridan. The move resulted in the withdrawal of the amendment, and a crucial parliamentary vote in favour of the legislation. At a session of First Minister's Questions in 2002, she narrowly avoided becoming the first MSP to be ejected from the parliament after continuing to speak when Presiding Officer David Steel had told her to sit down. Steel felt her supplementary question about youth crime was too long, but the incident led to a heated <b>parliamentary</b> <b>debate,</b> and accusations from Lamont's colleague, Labour's Helen Eadie that the Presiding Officer was not treating male and female MSPs equally, an allegation he rejected.|$|E
5|$|In July 1991, Špegelj and Đodan's demands were {{backed up}} {{by a number of}} Croatian Parliament members during a <b>parliamentary</b> <b>debate.</b> This led Tuđman to dismiss Đodan the same month he was {{appointed}} Defence Minister, and Špegelj resigned his post on 3 August. The deteriorating situation in eastern Croatia including JNA forces' removal of the ZNG from Baranja, intermittent fighting around Osijek, Vukovar and Vinkovci increasing losses and the growing conviction that the JNA actively supported the Croatian Serb revoltforced Tuđman to act. On 22 August, he issued an ultimatum to the federal Yugoslav authorities demanding the withdrawal of the JNA to its barracks {{by the end of the}} month. The ultimatum stated if the JNA failed to comply, Croatia would consider it an army of occupation and take corresponding action. On 1 September, the EC proposed a ceasefire and a peace conference was accepted by Tuđmandespite his ultimatumand by the Yugoslav Presidency. The conference started on 7 September, but only four days later, the Croatian member and chair of the presidency Stjepan Mesić ordered the JNA to return to its barracks within 48 hours. The move was motivated by Tuđman's impression that the conference would continue while the ZNG lost ground. Even though the order was disputed by other members of the body, it gave Croatia a justification to openly confront the JNA.|$|E
