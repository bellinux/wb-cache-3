5|$|A survey {{conducted}} in 2006 identified 216 {{species of birds}} known to have occurred in Petrified Forest National Park since the park became a protected area in 1906. Of those, 33 species breed within the park, 6 other species <b>probably</b> <b>do,</b> and 18 species live in the park year-round. Thirty-five species live in the park only {{during the summer and}} 11 species only during the winter. The greatest diversity of birds occurs during fall and winter migrations.|$|E
5|$|Population size {{is usually}} largest {{during the summer}} and declines during winter, {{although}} populations in Texas and Louisiana may be more seasonally stable. Animals also often lose weight during winter. Population size varies dramatically from year to year in southern Texas. In coastal Mississippi, storms <b>probably</b> <b>do</b> not cause the population to decline substantially, and in Texas, inundation of its habitat did not significantly influence population density. However, in Mississippi, flooding did cause a marked decline in rice rat abundance.|$|E
5|$|Between 1926 and 1972, no Albertosaurus fossils {{were found}} at all; but, since the seventies, {{there has been a}} steady {{increase}} in the known material. Apart from the Dry Island bonebed, six more skulls and skeletons have since been discovered in Alberta and are housed in various Canadian museums: specimens RTMP 81.010.001, found in 1978 by amateur paleontologist Maurice Stefanuk; RTMP 85.098.001, found by Stefanuk on 16 June 1985; RTMP 86.64.001 (December 1985); RTMP 86.205.001 (1986); RTMP 97.058.0001 (1996); and CMN 11315. However, due to vandalism and accidents, no undamaged and complete skulls could be secured among these finds. Fossils have also been reported from the American states of Montana, New Mexico, and Wyoming, but these <b>probably</b> <b>do</b> not represent A. sarcophagus and may not even belong to the genus Albertosaurus.|$|E

5|$|Medusae {{and complex}} {{swimming}} colonies such as siphonophores and chondrophores sense tilt and acceleration {{by means of}} statocysts, chambers lined with hairs which detect the movements of internal mineral grains called statoliths. If the body tilts in the wrong direction, the animal rights itself by increasing {{the strength of the}} swimming movements on the side that is too low. Most species have ocelli ("simple eyes"), which can detect sources of light. However the agile Box Jellyfish are unique among Medusae because they possess four kinds of true eyes that have retinas, corneas and lenses. Although the eyes <b>probably</b> <b>do</b> not form images, Cubozoa can clearly distinguish the direction from which light is coming as well as negotiate around solid-colored objects.|$|E

25|$|These {{assumptions}} might not, and <b>probably</b> <b>do</b> not, {{reflect the}} actual {{conditions of the}} market in which the subject business might be sold. However, these conditions are assumed because they yield a uniform standard of value, after applying generally accepted valuation techniques, which allows meaningful comparison between businesses which are similarly situated.|$|E
25|$|The 'apsara dance' {{of today}} was created under the {{guidance}} of Queen Kossamak Nearireath. Its costume is based on the bas-relief of apsaras on temple ruins but much of it, including its music and gesture is not unique from other classical Khmer dances that <b>probably</b> <b>do</b> not date back to the Angkor period.|$|E
25|$|Valerian also {{contains}} isovaltrate, {{which has been}} shown to be an inverse agonist for adenosine A1 receptor sites. This action likely does not contribute to the herb's possible sedative effects, which would be expected from an agonist, rather than an inverse agonist, at this particular binding site. Hydrophilic extractions of the herb commonly sold over the counter, however, <b>probably</b> <b>do</b> not contain significant amounts of isovaltrate. Valerenic acid in valerian stimulates serotonin receptors as a partial agonist, including 5-HT5A which is implicated in the sleep-wake cycle.|$|E

25|$|The {{hydrolysis}} of GM2-ganglioside requires three proteins. Two of {{them are}} subunits of hexosaminidasenbsp&A; the third is a small glycolipid transport protein, the GM2 activator protein (GM2A), which acts as a substrate-specific cofactor for the enzyme. Deficiency {{in any one of}} these proteins leads to ganglioside storage, primarily in the lysosomes of neurons. Tay–Sachs disease (along with AB-variant GM2-gangliosidosis and Sandhoff disease) occurs because a mutation inherited from both parents deactivates or inhibits this process. Most Tay–Sachs mutations <b>probably</b> <b>do</b> not directly affect protein functional elements (e.g., the active site). Instead, they cause incorrect folding (disrupting function) or disable intracellular transport.|$|E
25|$|Nanotechnology has the {{potential}} to reshape the entire world, Kurzweil exclaims. Assembling materials molecule by molecule could solve energy problems, cure cancer and other diseases, strengthen our bodies, and produce self-assembling food, clothing, and buildings. Kurzweil admits that nanotechnology carries a big risk; a self-replicating substance, without the constraints of a living organism, might grow out of control and consume everything. However he points out that today there are already technologies which pose grave risks, for example nuclear power or weapons, and we have managed to keep them relatively safe, so he feels we can <b>probably</b> <b>do</b> the same with nanotechnology.|$|E
25|$|The {{remaining}} trace (<1% volume) compounds give flatus its smell. Historically, compounds such as indole, skatole, ammonia {{and short}} chain fatty acids {{were thought to}} cause the smell of flatus. More recent evidence proves that the major contribution to the smell of flatus comes {{from a combination of}} volatile sulfur compounds (VSC). It is known that hydrogen sulfide (H2S), methyl mercaptan, MM (also known as methanethiol, MT), dimethyl sulfide (DMS), dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) and dimethyl trisulfide (DMTS) are present in flatus. The benzopyrrole volatiles indole and skatole have a mothball smell, and therefore <b>probably</b> <b>do</b> not contribute greatly to the characteristic smell of flatus.|$|E

25|$|The Chauci {{were one}} of the most {{prominent}} early Germanic sea raiders. They are probable participants in the Germanic flotilla that was destroyed by Drusus in 12 BC. They were raiding the coasts of Roman Belgica in AD 41, long before they participated in further raids of the same coasts under Gannascus in AD 47. It is likely that their raiding was endemic over the years, as the few surviving accounts <b>probably</b> <b>do</b> not reflect all occurrences. Tacitus describes the Chauci as 'peaceful' in his Germania (AD 98), but this is in a passage describing the non-coastal, inland Chauci, whereas sea raiders are necessarily a coastal people.|$|E
25|$|Except for Bentheuphausia amblyops, krill are bioluminescent animals having organs called photophores {{that can}} emit light. The light is {{generated}} by an enzyme-catalysed chemiluminescence reaction, wherein a luciferin (a kind of pigment) is activated by a luciferase enzyme. Studies indicate that the luciferin of many krill species is a fluorescent tetrapyrrole similar but not identical to dinoflagellate luciferin and that the krill <b>probably</b> <b>do</b> not produce this substance themselves but acquire {{it as part of}} their diet, which contains dinoflagellates. Krill photophores are complex organs with lenses and focusing abilities, and can be rotated by muscles. The precise function of these organs is as yet unknown; possibilities include mating, social interaction or orientation and as a form of counter-illumination camouflage to compensate their shadow against overhead ambient light.|$|E
25|$|Aquaria may {{be grouped}} by their species selection. The {{community}} tank {{is the most common}} today, where several non-aggressive species live peacefully. In these aquaria, the fish, invertebrates, and plants <b>probably</b> <b>do</b> not originate from the same geographic region, but tolerate similar water conditions. Aggressive tanks, in contrast, house a limited number of species that can be aggressive toward other fish, or are able to withstand aggression well. Most marine tanks and tanks housing cichlids have to take the aggressiveness of the desired species into account when stocking. Specimen tanks usually only house one fish species, along with plants, perhaps ones found in the fishes' natural environment and decorations simulating a natural ecosystem. This type is useful for fish that cannot coexist with other fish, such as the electric eel, as an extreme example. Some tanks of this sort are used simply to house adults for breeding.|$|E

25|$|The {{current range}} of black bears in the United States is {{constant}} {{throughout most of}} the Northeast, and within the Appalachian Mountains almost continuously from Maine to north Georgia, the northern Midwest, the Rocky Mountain region, the West Coast and Alaska. However, it becomes increasingly fragmented or absent in other regions. Despite this, black bears in those areas seem to have expanded their range during the last decade, such as with recent sightings in Ohio and southern Indiana, though these <b>probably</b> <b>do</b> not yet represent stable breeding populations. Surveys taken from 35 states in the early 1990s indicate that black bears are either stable or increasing, except in Idaho and New Mexico. The overall population of black bears in the United States has been estimated to range between 339,000 and 465,000, though this excludes populations from Alaska, Idaho, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming, whose population sizes are unknown. In the state of Maine, there are an estimated 30,000 black bears, making it the largest black bear population in the Contiguous United States.|$|E
500|$|When SpongeBob SquarePants premiered, Plankton was {{not part}} of the series' main cast. Plankton's voice actor, Mr. Lawrence, has stated that after {{producing}} Plankton's debut episode in the late 1990s, creator Stephen Hillenburg was unsure if he would continue to use the character. After recording it, Hillenburg was noncommittal, telling Lawrence: [...] "We'll <b>probably</b> <b>do</b> another [...] next year," [...] Lawrence summarized Plankton's origins in 2015, saying that he [...] "was only supposed to be in one or two episodes, but I was a writer on the show and I really liked this character". Following his first voice recording as Plankton, Lawrence drafted some of his own ideas for the character and passed them to Hillenburg. From then on, Plankton began to appear more often. Lawrence considers the third season the first in which Plankton is a main character.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, EGV Entertainment, a {{movie theater}} {{operator}} in Thailand, opened the EGV Drive-in Cafe in Bangkok, explicitly modeling the restaurant after the Sci-Fi Dine-In. Wichai Poolwaraluk, the company's executive {{president and chief executive}} officer, visited the Sci-Fi Dine-In in 2000, and was inspired to open a similar restaurant. He said that, while he was eating at the Sci-Fi Dine-In, the other guests seemed more interested in their food than in the film clips on the screen, and he therefore considered the Sci-Fi Dine-In more of a restaurant than a theater, with the film reel simply being a gimmick. Appealing to EGV's identity as {{a movie theater}} operator, Poolwaraluk said that the EGV Drive-in Cafe [...] "can <b>probably</b> <b>do</b> a better job blending the cinema and the food together and also concentrate on both of them". Like the Sci-Fi Dine-In, the EGV Drive-in Cafe features classic cars for seating, but, instead of showing film clips on a loop, the EGV Drive-in Cafe shows entire short films.|$|E
