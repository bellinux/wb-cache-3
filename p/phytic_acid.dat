25|$|Fat-free (defatted) {{soybean meal}} is a {{significant}} and cheap source of protein for animal feeds and many packaged meals. For example, soybean products, such as textured vegetable protein (TVP), are ingredients in many meat and dairy substitutes.

Soy vegetable oil, used in food and industrial applications, is another product of processing the soybean crop. Traditional non-fermented food uses of soybeans include soy milk from which tofu and tofu skin are made. Fermented soy foods include soy sauce, fermented bean paste, natto and tempeh.|$|E
500|$|The cowpea {{has often}} been {{referred}} to as [...] "poor man's meat" [...] due to the high levels of protein found in the seeds and leaves. However, it does contain some anti-nutritional elements, notable <b>phytic</b> <b>acid</b> and protease inhibitors, which reduces the nutritional value of the crop. Although little research has been conducted on the nutritional value of the leaves and immature pods, what is available suggests that the leaves have a similar nutrition value to black nightshade and sweet potato leaves, while the green pods have less anti-nutritional factors than the dried seeds.|$|E
2500|$|The Enviropig is {{a genetically}} {{modified}} Yorkshire pig that expresses phytase in its saliva. Grains, such as corn and wheat, have phosphorus that is bound in an naturally indigestible form known as <b>phytic</b> <b>acid.</b> Phosphorus, an essential nutrient for pigs, is then {{added to the}} diet, since {{it can not be}} broken down in the pigs digestive tract. [...] As a result, nearly all of the phosphorus naturally found in the grain is wasted in the feces, and can contribute to elevated levels in the soil. Phytase is an enzyme that is able to break down the otherwise indigestible <b>phytic</b> <b>acid,</b> making it available to the pig. The ability of the Enviropig to digest the phosphorus from the grains eliminates the waste of that natural phosphorus (20-60% reduction), while also eliminating the need to supplement the nutrient in feed.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Soybean seeds contain many biologically active {{secondary}} metabolites, such as proteins, saponins, iso-flavones, <b>phytic</b> <b>acids,</b> trypsin inhibitors and phytosterols.

40|$|Starchy {{roots and}} tuber crops play {{a pivotal role}} in the human diet. There are number of roots and tubers which make an {{extensive}} biodiversity even within the same geographical location. Thus, they add variety to the diet in addition to offering numerous desirable nutritional and health benefits such as antioxidative, hypoglycemic, hypocholesterolemic, antimicrobial, and immunomodulatory activities. A number of bioactive constituents such as phenolic compounds, saponins, bioactive proteins, glycoalkaloids, and <b>phytic</b> <b>acids</b> are responsible for the observed effects. Many starchy tuber crops, except the common potatoes, sweet potatoes, and cassava, are not yet fully explored for their nutritional and health benefits. In Asian countries, some edible tubers are also used as traditional medicinal. A variety of foods can be prepared using tubers and they may also be used in industrial applications.

40|$|Barley is a grain whose {{consumption}} has {{a significant}} nutritional benefit for human health as a very good source of dietary fibre, minerals, vitamins, and phenolic and <b>phytic</b> <b>acids.</b> Nowadays, it {{is more and more}} often used in the production of plant milk, which is used to replace cow milk in the diet by an increasing number of consumers. The aim {{of the study was to}} classify barley milk and determine the optimal processing conditions in barley milk production based on NIR spectra, particle size, and total dissolved solids analysis. Standard recipe for barley milk was used without added additives. Barley grain was ground and mixed in a blender for 15, 30, 45, and 60 seconds. The samples were filtered and particle size of the grains was determined by laser diffraction particle sizing. The plant milk was also analysed using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), in the range from 904 to 1699 [*]nm. Furthermore, conductivity of each sample was determined and microphotographs were taken in order to identify the structure of fat globules and particles in the barley milk. NIR spectra, particle size distribution, and conductivity results all point to 45 seconds as the optimal blending time, since further blending results in the saturation of the samples...|$|R
2500|$|Iron from {{different}} foods is absorbed and processed differently by the body; for instance, iron in meat (heme-iron source) is more easily absorbed than iron in grains and vegetables ("non-heme" [...] iron sources). Minerals and chemicals in {{one type of}} food may also inhibit absorption of iron from another type of food eaten at the same time. For example, oxalates and <b>phytic</b> <b>acid</b> form insoluble complexes which bind iron in the gut {{before it can be}} absorbed.|$|E

In cases of diarrhoea this stale rice is not to be served to the patient. According to another study (ILSI 1998), fermentation improves the bioavailability of minerals such as iron and zinc as a result of <b>phytic</b> <b>acid</b> hydrolysis, and increases the content of riboflavin and vitamin B.

30|$|Inclusion of GC in broiler ration {{appeared}} to increase feed intake during the later stage of development. The increased feed intake with increasing level of GC may indicate its {{positive influence on}} appetite of the birds and nutrient digestion. Similar to the present result, earlier works showed increased intake (Windisch et al. 2007) as well as digestion (Mellor 2000) in birds consumed feeds prepared with inclusion of herbs and various plant extracts due to their appetite and digestion stimulating properties. Herbs and their extracts are known {{to contribute to the}} nutrient requirements of the animals (Frankic et al. 2009) due to their complex mixture of bio-active components and some unidentified factors and their stimulating effect of digestive enzymes (Jang et al. 2007). Nevertheless, the increased intake in the present experiment did not improve average daily gain at the higher level of inclusion, {{may be due to the}} presence of certain anti-nutritional factors. According to Agarwal and Sharma (2013), whole GC seed flour contain tannins, <b>phytic</b> <b>acids,</b> oxalic acid and cyanogens (51, 0.77, 136 and 5.50  mg/ 100  g, respectively), which might have hampered the bioavailability of nutrients. Similar to the present study, moderate level of GC inclusion in rats ration (Al Hamedan 2010) resulted in higher weight gain and feed efficiency ratio than the control group. Likewise, positive effect of GC on live weight, FCR and egg production were reported (Nada 1999) when included at low level in the ration of hen. Feeding GC seeds to rat in water suspension did not improve body weight in the first 3  weeks, but body weight significantly decreased after 6  weeks at doses of 4  g/ 100  mL and 8  g/ 100  mL compared to 2  g/ 100  mL and the control groups indicating high dose negatively influenced body weight gain (Bafeel and Ali 2009).|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} aimed the {{extraction}} of total flavonoids, anthocyanins and phenolics, {{as well as the}} antioxidant activity of black rice (Oryza sativa) and to study the stability in relation to pH, light and copigmentation. Variations in temperature (10 – 50 °C), time (20 – 80 min), and solid–solvent ratio (1 : 15 – 1 : 45) were studied using a Box–Behnken design. The regression models were significant (P< 0. 001) and determination coefficients ⩾ 0. 900. Extraction at 34. 7 °C for 80 min using a solid:solvent ratio of 1 : 30 rendered an extract with 51. 26 mg 100 g− 1 of flavonoids, 116. 58 mg 100 g− 1 of anthocyanins, 520. 17 mg 100 g− 1 of phenolics and 46. 50 % inhibition of the DPPH radical. A decrease in the color intensity was observed when pH values were changed while anthocyanins were reversible in the process of protonation/deprotonation.

40|$|Arabinoxylans (AXs) were {{extracted}} from destarched wheat bran (DWB) according to different processes, {{with a view}} to their production at industrial scale. Two fractions (F 3 a and F 3 b, respectively purified on 10 kDa and 100 kDa ultrafiltration membranes) were obtained with low yields by treating DWB with an endoxylanase and this process left a solid residue exhausted in enzyme-extractable AXs (EDWB). F 1 and F 2 AX fractions were obtained by treatment with sodium hydroxide of respectively DWB and EDWB. The fraction F 4 resulted from a hydrothermal treatment of EDWB in a pressure reactor, followed by ethanol precipitation. The different AX fractions were characterized and compared for the composition in monosaccharides, for the contents in fats and in ferulic, <b>phytic</b> and uronic <b>acids,</b> for the molecular mass distribution and the degrees of methylation and acetylation. The alkaline extractions gave one desesterified AX population with molecular mass (MM) higher than 670 kDa and arabinose/xylose ratios (Ara/Xyl) around 1. The enzyme and thermal treatments yielded AXs with two main populations in size-exclusion chromatography (the largest one at 5 - 12. 5 kDa and a second one at 140 - 160 kDa), having overall Ara/Xyl of respectively 0. 7 and 0. 5 for both processes. These data bring information about the influence of the process on the characteristics of AX fractions obtained from pretreated wheat bran. Here are also reported processes that enabled to recover enzyme-unextractable AXs from DWB, including an original and up-scalable hydrothermal extraction.

40|$|In this {{four-year}} proposal, we aim {{to produce}} high value purified micron-nano bioactiveparticles, individually from propolis, rice bran and wine lees by using supercritical fluidscrystallization. Counter-current supercritical fluids extractive distillation and columnchromatography will be previously and subsequently employed to concentrate and isolatefunctional compounds from these raw materials. In the first year, phase equilibria and expansion coefficients of potential solventssolvated with supercritical fluids (carbon dioxide and propane) will be experimentallymeasured at elevated pressures. Then, batch supercritical anti-solvent (SAS) crystallizationswill be adopted to micronize bioactive compounds from propolis. The key controllingparameters of the SAS experiments including expanded temperature, expanded pressure,solvent type, solvent volume, pre-post expansion rate and substrate concentration will beinvestigated by means of analyses of quantification and particle size distribution through anexperimental design. In the second year, {{we aim to}} investigate continuous supercritical fluids crystallizationapplied to produce micronized particles of flavonoids, DHCA, and other active compoundsfrom propolis. In the mean time, isolation and purification of bioactive compounds usingcolumn chromatography {{will be carried out}} to obtain marker type standards having highpurity and high recovery. Afterwards, bioactive tests shall be done to examine thebioavailability of those purified precipitates. In the third and fourth year, production of nano-particles of 訕-oryzanol, <b>phytic</b> acid,inositol, amino <b>acids</b> individually from rice bran and wine lees, will be investigated by usingcontinuous supercritical fluids crystallization, counter-current supercritical fluids extractivedistillation, and packed column chromatography sequentially.
