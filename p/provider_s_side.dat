30|$|Public key {{encryption}} with keyword search (PEKS) schemes, {{first proposed}} in [4], {{can be useful}} in this respect. Such a scheme allows a user to delegate searching capabilities on publicly encrypted data to a third party (e.g., an email storage provider) without revealing information in the data. Consider a distributed e-mail system (or a distributed storage system) that consists of three entities, namely an originating sender, a receiver (R), and an email server or storage <b>provider</b> (<b>S).</b> The sender encrypts an email message with a conventional public key encryption scheme (PKE) [9]. S/He also encrypts a keyword (or a list of keywords) associated with the mail content with a PEKS scheme. S/He then appends the PEKS ciphertext to the PKE ciphertext and sends both to the email storage provider. R sends a trapdoor associated with a searching keyword w to the email storage <b>provider</b> <b>S</b> for retrieving all the emails containing the keyword. The PEKS scheme enables S to test whether w is a keyword associated with the email but learns nothing else about the email.|$|R

40|$|With the {{tremendous}} {{growth in the}} amount of information stored on remote locations and cloud systems, many service providers are seeking ways {{to reduce the amount of}} redundant information sent across networks by using data de-duplication techniques. Data de-duplication can reduce network traffic without the loss of information, and consequently increase available network bandwidth by reducing redundant traffic. However, due to the heavy computation required for detecting and reducing redundant data transmission, de-duplication itself can become a bottleneck in high capacity links. We completed two parts of work in this research study, Hardware Accelerated Redundancy Elimination in Network Systems (HARENS) and Distributed Redundancy Elimination System Simulation (DRESS). HARENS can significantly improve the performance of redundancy elimination algorithm in a network system by leveraging General Purpose Graphic Processing Unit (GPGPU) techniques as well as other big data optimizations such as the use of a hierarchical multi-threaded pipeline, single machine Map-Reduce, and memory efficiency techniques. Our results indicate that throughput can be increased by a factor of 9 times compared to a naive implementation of the data de-duplication algorithm, providing a net transmission increase of up to 3. 0 Gigabits per second (Gbps). DRESS provides further acceleration to the redundancy elimination in network system by deploying HARENS as the server 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>side</b> redundancy elimination module, and four cooperative distributed byte caches on the clients 2 ̆ 7 side. A client 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>side</b> distributed byte cache broadcast its cached chunks by sending hash values to other byte caches, so that they can keep a record of all the chunks in the cooperative distributed cache system. When duplications are detected, a client 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>side</b> byte cache can fetch a chunk directly from either its own cache or peer byte caches rather than server 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>side</b> redundancy elimination module. Our results indicate that bandwidth savings of the redundancy elimination system with cooperative distributed byte cache can be increased by 12...|$|R

30|$|We {{define the}} load on a service {{provider}} SP {{as the number}} of requests handled by the SP during the simulation time. In the LocVSDP [3], the service requester receives in the service reply the information of the closest requested service provider {{to the center of the}} desired RI. If many service requesters specify the same RI, then the same service <b>provider</b> <b>S</b> P 0 would be returned to these service requesters, even if there are other service providers located in the desired RI. Thus, the service <b>provider</b> <b>S</b> P 0 would be overloaded while the other service providers located in the RI are underloaded, which can affect the performance of the overloaded service provider. In order to overcome this weakness and balance the load on service providers in the vehicular network, we proposed the following load balancing technique: When a service client sends its request to the desired RI, the RRs inside the RI compute a spanning tree with a unique leader RR. Then all RRs send their local replies to the leader of the spanning tree starting from the leaves. In their local replies, every RR adds the load on each service provider in its range. The leader RR receives all the information about SPs including their loads. In the reply returned to the service requester, the leader sends the information of service providers ranked from the less loaded one to the most loaded one. Then the service requester connects to the service provider that satisfies the desired QoS requirements. The chosen service provider updates its load and acknowledges its neighboring RRs about its new load that would be considered for future requests.|$|R
