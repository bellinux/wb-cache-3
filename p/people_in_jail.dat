25|$|Housing the {{approximately}} 500,000 <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>jail</b> in the US awaiting trial who cannot afford bail costs $9billion a year. Most jail inmates are petty, nonviolent offenders. Twenty years ago most nonviolent defendants were released {{on their own}} recognizance (trusted {{to show up at}} trial). Now most are given bail, and most pay a bail bondsman to afford it. 62% of local jail inmates are awaiting trial.|$|E

2500|$|Due to {{the often}} {{political}} and cultural contours of blackness in the United States, the notion of blackness can also be extended to non-black people. Toni Morrison once described Bill Clinton as the first black President of the United States, because, as she put it, he displayed [...] "almost every trope of blackness". Christopher Hitchens was offended by the notion of Clinton as the first black president, noting, [...] "Mr Clinton, according to Toni Morrison, the Nobel Prize-winning novelist, is our first black President, the first {{to come from the}} broken home, the alcoholic mother, the under-the-bridge shadows of our ranking systems. Thus, we may have lost the mystical power to divine diabolism, but we can still divine blackness by the following symptoms: broken homes, alcoholic mothers, under-the-bridge habits and (presumable from the rest of [...] Miller's senescent musings) the tendency to sexual predation and to shameless perjury about same." [...] Some black activists were also offended, claiming that Clinton used his knowledge of black culture to exploit black people for political gain as no other president had before, while not serving black interests. They cite the lack of action during the Rwandan Genocide and his welfare reform, which Larry Roberts said had led to the worst child poverty since the 1960s. Others cited that the number of black <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>jail</b> increased during his administration.|$|E

60|$|The girl sat a {{long time}} with the letter in her hand. She was but a child, after all, and the lad's words alarmed and {{burdened}} her, for {{the meaning of the}} letter was plain. It was a message of love and admiration, and though it contained no subtleties, it came from one who was in jail, and she had been taught to regard <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>jail</b> as lost souls, aliens with whom it was dangerous to hold any intercourse, save in prayer and Scripture. The handsome boy with the sad face had appealed to her very deeply, and she bore him in her thoughts a great deal; but now he came in a new guise--as a lover, bold, outspoken, and persuasive.|$|E
6000|$|You {{lament the}} inconceivable {{disasters}} [...] "inaugurated by {{the attack on}} Sumter." [...] True enough {{they may have been}} inaugurated by that act, but their unconcealed cause lies far back of that, as we have shown. That was only a raising of the curtain, or rather a forcing of it to be raised by the Abolitionists--a beginning of the bloody drama. Who caused the attack? What meant those human cargoes that approached so close to its walls the day before the battle? Why did the worthy (?) Lincoln so long deceive the South^rn Commissioners by promise after promise not to make war, but to evacuate the fort, & meet them, as a sensible Pres. would have done, in friendly negotiation for peace? S.C. was right, and acted nobly in the affair, and was as justifiable therein, as was Anderson in occupying the Fort before he had a reason for doing so, declaring by his overt act that the U.S. forces under him were at enmity with S.C. But then you say S.C. should have first tried Lincoln before determining to secede. I think she saw with prophetic vision the end from the beginning. She took Lincoln at his word--that itself was oppression & tyranny sufficient to burst asunder the closest ties of Union that could exist in any Country. You say we sh^d. give everything a fair trial. I disagree. If I saw a serpent in my path & it sh^d. attempt to make battle, or declare its hostility by displaying its horrid fangs, do you think I would coolly stand by & give it a fair trial, & test its friendship? I would be impelled, even had I never seen or heard of such a creature before, to crush it immediately, & so S.C. has sensibly said to the Administration [...] "Serpent, bite a file!" [...] As to your Eulogium on Lincoln I have not much to say. If he pleases you, well enough, you're easily satisfied. I take it that he is a disgrace to the Chair he occupies; and to judge from his conversations, he is devoid of all sense of refinement & etiquette; to look at his executive powers as displayed thus far, he had better be a Bey than helmsman of the [...] "Old Ship"; and what of his efforts at speeches? In the language of Logan, [...] "I appeal to any white man" [...] to say if they would not be a disgrace to many a [...] "Country 'Squire"! And yet such a man elevated to the highest position in the gift of the American people! There {{was a time when the}} soundest and most learned men of the land were made Presidents, now a man's capacity for the office seems to depend on the meanness of his intellect & the number of rails he can split in a day. And so great were his [...] "maul & wedge" [...] propensities that he withheld not his hand from splitting the Tree of Liberty. But let us inquire upon which side [...] "humanity" [...] stands in this contest. You complain much of several (local) depredations com^td by South on private boats &c. I ask, in candor, if it was not in retaliation for like outrages com^td by the North. I am certain as to its being so in several cases. The very 1st boat thus ill-treated was one belonging to the South on its way down the Miss. & attacked at Cairo. To retaliate they determined to attack North^en boats coming up the river. And what have your noble Ohioans done lately & repeatedly with our Ka. boats at Gallipolis? Thrice have they overhauled the same boat and twice kept every pound of freight on her timbers. But this is not all; your humane Lincoln has closed the Southern ports, & is daily robbing vessels on their way in & out of the same. During the last week he stole $150,000 worth of Southern Tobacco, & thus the programme continues. Very humane indeed! Again, he is no invader! No indeed! by no means! yet hundreds of Citizens are now fleeing from Wheeling, & other towns invaded, for personal safety. Scarce a day passes but some one stops here who has thus escaped. If they remain on their own soil and round their proper hearthstone the (very) humane doom of a murderer awaits them! The North don't intend to make invasion at all, yet 4000 F^l troops are now in Parkersburg, breaking up printing presses, putting innocent <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>jail,</b> and doing other humane acts, [...] "too numerous to mention." [...] According to my letter from Father I understand they don't have the first principles of Civilized warfare--they intend to hang all their prisoners. Oh! humanity! HUMANITY! ...|$|E
