5|$|In children, the <b>penicillamine</b> test may be used. A 500 mg oral dose of <b>penicillamine</b> is administered, {{and urine}} {{collected}} for 24 hours. If this {{contains more than}} 1600 μg (25 μmol), it is a reliable indicator of Wilson's disease. This test has not been validated in adults.|$|E
5|$|People who are {{asymptomatic}} (for instance, those diagnosed through {{family screening}} or {{only as a}} result of abnormal test results) are generally treated, as the copper accumulation may cause long-term damage in the future. It is unclear whether these people are best treated with <b>penicillamine</b> or zinc acetate.|$|E
5|$|Cumings, and {{simultaneously}} the New Zealand neurologist Derek Denny-Brown, {{working in the}} United States, first reported effective treatment with metal chelator British anti-Lewisite in 1951. This treatment had to be injected but {{was one of the}} first therapies available in the field of neurology, a field that classically was able to observe and diagnose but had few treatments to offer. The first effective oral chelation agent, <b>penicillamine,</b> was discovered in 1956 by British neurologist John Walshe. In 1982, Walshe also introduced trientine, and was the first to develop tetrathiomolybdate for clinical use. Zinc acetate therapy initially made its appearance in the Netherlands, where physicians Schouwink and Hoogenraad used it in 1961 and in the 1970s, respectively, but it was further developed later by Brewer and colleagues at the University of Michigan.|$|E
5|$|The World Health Organization {{assisted}} the Iraqi government through {{the supply of}} drugs, analytical equipment and expertise. Many new treatments were tried, since existing methods for heavy metal poisoning were not particularly effective. Dimercaprol was administered to several patients, but caused rapid deterioration of their condition. It was ruled out {{as a treatment for}} this sort of poisoning following the outbreak. Polythiol resins, <b>penicillamine</b> and dimercaprol sulfonate all helped, but are believed to have been largely insignificant in overall recovery and outcomes. Dialysis was tested on a few patients late in the treatment period, but they showed no clinical improvement. The result of all treatments was varied, with some patients' blood mercury level being dramatically reduced, but a negligible effect in others. All patients received periods of treatment interspersed with lay periods; continuous treatment was suggested in future cases. Later treatment was less effective in reducing blood toxicity.|$|E
25|$|Drug reactions, {{with the}} most common {{inducers}} including gold salts, beta blockers, traditional antimalarials (e.g. quinine), thiazide diuretics, furosemide, spironolactone, metformin and <b>penicillamine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Renal {{amyloidosis}} {{can occur}} {{as a consequence of}} untreated chronic inflammation. Treatment with <b>penicillamine</b> and gold salts are recognized causes of membranous nephropathy.|$|E
25|$|Alcoholic {{cirrhosis}} {{caused by}} alcohol abuse is treated by abstaining from alcohol. Treatment for hepatitis-related cirrhosis involves medications {{used to treat}} {{the different types of}} hepatitis, such as interferon for viral hepatitis and corticosteroids for autoimmune hepatitis. Cirrhosis caused by Wilson's disease, in which copper builds up in organs, is treated with chelation therapy (for example, <b>penicillamine)</b> to remove the copper.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} {{a wide variety of}} drugs that can trigger dysgeusia, {{including}} zopiclone, H1-antihistamines, such as azelastine and emedastine. Approximately 250 drugs affect taste. The sodium channels linked to taste receptors can be inhibited by amiloride, and the creation of new taste buds and saliva can be impeded by antiproliferative drugs. Saliva can have traces of the drug, giving rise to a metallic flavor in the mouth; examples include lithium carbonate and tetracyclines. Drugs containing sulfhydryl groups, including <b>penicillamine</b> and captopril, may react with zinc and cause deficiency. Metronidazole and chlorhexidine have been found to interact with metal ions that associate with the cell membrane. Drugs that prevent the production of angiotensin II by inhibiting angiotensin converting enzyme, eprosartan for example, have been linked to dysgeusia. There are few case reports claiming calcium channel blockers like Amlodipine also cause dysguesia by blocking calcium sensitive taste buds.|$|E
25|$|If {{diagnosed}} {{and treated}} early enough, patients with Wilson's disease may live long and productive lives. Wilson's disease is managed by copper chelation therapy with D-penicillamine (which picks up and binds copper and enables patients to excrete excess copper accumulated in the liver), therapy with zinc sulfate or zinc acetate, and restrictive dietary metal intake, {{such as the}} elimination of chocolate, oysters, and mushrooms. Zinc therapy is now the treatment of choice. Zinc produces a mucosal block by inducing metallothionein, which binds copper in mucosal cells until they slough off and are eliminated in the feces. and it competes with copper for absorption in the intestine by DMT1 (Divalent Metal transporter 1). More recently, experimental treatments with tetrathiomolybdate showed promising results. Tetrathiomolybdate {{appears to be an}} excellent form of initial treatment in patients who have neurologic symptoms. In contrast to <b>penicillamine</b> therapy, initial treatment with tetrathiomolybdate rarely allows further, often irreversible, neurologic deterioration.|$|E
500|$|Generally, <b>penicillamine</b> is {{the first}} {{treatment}} used. This binds copper (chelation) and leads to excretion of copper in the urine. Hence, monitoring {{of the amount of}} copper in the urine can be done to ensure a sufficiently high dose is taken. <b>Penicillamine</b> is not without problems: about 20% experience a side effect or complication of <b>penicillamine</b> treatment, such as drug-induced lupus (causing joint pains and a skin rash) or myasthenia (a nerve condition leading to muscle weakness). In those who presented with neurological symptoms, almost half experience a paradoxical worsening in their symptoms. While this phenomenon is observed in other treatments for Wilson's, it is usually taken as an indication for discontinuing <b>penicillamine</b> and commencing second-line treatment. Those intolerant to <b>penicillamine</b> may instead be commenced on trientine hydrochloride, which also has chelating properties. Some recommend trientine as first-line treatment, but experience with <b>penicillamine</b> is more extensive. A further agent, under clinical investigation by Wilson Therapeutics, with known activity in Wilson's disease is tetrathiomolybdate. [...] This is regarded as experimental, though some studies have shown a beneficial effect.|$|E
2500|$|Topical {{treatment}} for the skin changes of scleroderma do not alter the disease course, but may improve pain and ulceration. A range of NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) {{can be used to}} ease painful symptoms, such as naproxen. There is limited benefit from steroids such as prednisone. Episodes of Raynaud's phenomenon sometimes respond to nifedipine or other calcium channel blockers; severe digital ulceration may respond to prostacyclin analogue iloprost, and the dual endothelin-receptor antagonist bosentan may be beneficial for Raynaud's phenomenon. The skin tightness may be treated systemically with methotrexate and ciclosporin. and the skin [...] thickness treated with <b>penicillamine.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Mercury {{occurs as}} salts such as mercuric {{chloride}} (HgCl2) and mercurous chloride (Hg2Cl2), the latter {{also known as}} calomel. Because they are more soluble in water, mercuric salts are usually more acutely toxic than mercurous salts. Their higher solubility lets them be more readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. [...] Mercury salts affect primarily the gastrointestinal tract and the kidneys, and can cause severe kidney damage; however, as they cannot cross the blood–brain barrier easily, these salts inflict little neurological damage without continuous or heavy exposure. Mercuric cyanide (Hg(CN)2) is a particularly toxic mercury compound {{that has been used}} in murders, as it contains not only mercury but also cyanide, leading to simultaneous cyanide poisoning. The drug n-acetyl <b>penicillamine</b> has been used to treat mercury poisoning with limited success.|$|E
