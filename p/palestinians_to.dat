After the wanted men were handed over the siege was lifted. With that, and a promise that he would issue {{a call to the}} <b>Palestinians</b> <b>to</b> halt attacks on Israelis, Arafat was released. He issued such a call on 8 May. On 19 September 2002, the IDF largely demolished the compound with armored bulldozers in order to isolate Arafat.

5|$|Jordan {{was home}} to 2,117,361 Palestinians in 2015, most of them Jordanian citizens.

West Bank Palestinians with family in Jordan or Jordanian citizenship were issued yellow cards guaranteeing them all the rights of Jordanian citizenship if requested.|$|E
