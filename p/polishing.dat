5|$|After initial cutting, {{the diamond}} is shaped in {{numerous}} stages of <b>polishing.</b> Unlike cutting, {{which is a}} responsible but quick operation, <b>polishing</b> removes material by gradual erosion and is extremely time consuming. The associated technique is well developed; it is considered as a routine and can be performed by technicians. After <b>polishing,</b> the diamond is reexamined for possible flaws, either remaining or induced by the process. Those flaws are concealed through various diamond enhancement techniques, such as repolishing, crack filling, or clever arrangement of the stone in the jewelry. Remaining non-diamond inclusions are removed through laser drilling and filling of the voids produced.|$|E

5|$|The {{dominant}} {{industrial use}} of diamond is in cutting, drilling, grinding, and <b>polishing.</b> Most of these applications {{do not require}} large diamonds; in fact, most diamonds of gem-quality except for their small size can be used industrially. Diamonds are embedded in drill tips or saw blades, or ground into a powder for use in grinding and <b>polishing</b> applications. Specialized applications include use in laboratories as containment for high pressure experiments (see diamond anvil cell), high-performance bearings, and limited use in specialized windows. With the continuing advances {{in the production of}} synthetic diamonds, new applications are becoming feasible. Garnering much excitement is the possible use of diamond as a semiconductor suitable for microchips, and because of its exceptional heat conductance property, as a heat sink in electronics.|$|E
5|$|Charcoal {{is used as}} {{a drawing}} {{material}} in artwork, barbecue grilling, iron smelting, and in many other applications. Wood, coal and oil are used as fuel for production of energy and heating. Gem quality diamond is used in jewelry, and industrial diamonds are used in drilling, cutting and <b>polishing</b> tools for machining metals and stone. Plastics are made from fossil hydrocarbons, and carbon fiber, made by pyrolysis of synthetic polyester fibers is used to reinforce plastics to form advanced, lightweight composite materials.|$|E
5|$|Diamonds {{have been}} treasured as gemstones since their use as {{religious}} icons in ancient India. Their usage in engraving tools also dates to early human history.

5|$|Prior to 1906, shoe polish was {{not well}} known as a purchasable product, nor was it {{particularly}} sophisticated. While sales were not especially high, a few brands, like Nugget, were available in the U.K. during the 19th century.

5|$|A concave line of {{abrasion}} and <b>polishing</b> can {{be found}} on both one of the central kerb-stones on the western end of the monument and a kerb-stone on the south-east of the monument.

Similar evidence for the sharpening of tools has been found at West Kennet Long Barrow, as well as later prehistoric monuments such as Stonehenge.|$|E
