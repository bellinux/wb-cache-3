Slater's youthful interests were with things mechanical, chemical, and electrical. A family helper, a college girl, finally <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>name</b> (then little-known as a subject) to his set of interests: physics. When Slater entered the University of Rochester in 1917 he took physics courses and as a senior assisted in the physics laboratory and did his first independent research for a special honors thesis, a measurement of the dependence on pressure of the intensities of the Balmer lines of hydrogen.|$|E

We saw many actors, but there was a quality I was looking for and I couldn't <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>name</b> on that quality. I finally figured out what it was when Nick came in and he had a kind of {{androgynous}} quality that worked. I thought he looked like Joe College, but he could scare the hell out of you." [...] Producer Glen Morgan said Chinlund's performance was outstanding. Nutter stated [...] "Nick Chinlund was wonderful to work with. The guy was like putty in my hands. He was great. If you're looking for someone to underline the weirdness and strangeness of the character, he did that." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{title track}} is a soca-pop song, and blends horns and {{background}} vocals with ukulele folk-pop and island percussion {{morphed into a}} programmed beat. It contains handclaps and subtle modern sound effects. Trainor uses an assertive throwback aural tone on the song. The rap verse in [...] "Title" [...] was compared to the works of Australian rapper Iggy Azalea and American duo Karmin. The song's lyrics see Trainor demanding her lover to <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>name</b> on their relationship status. It was described by the singer as [...] "call me your girlfriend, I'm sick of being your boo thing, so call me your girlfriend and give me that title". Musically, Trainor felt the song showcased what her artistic style was about, and said, [...] "I loved that 'Title' showed a little Caribbean drum before the chorus and then, like, a rap bridge that was, like… totally different sound." [...] Christina Garibaldi of MTV News wrote that the song serves a lesson for women not {{to settle for a}} friends-with-benefits relationship.|$|E

500|$|Toyah {{was aware}} that her {{attacker}} knew her as she remembered him calling her name, but could not <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>name</b> to the voice. She also struggled {{to deal with her}} [...] "physical and emotional scars" [...] and soon developed agoraphobia. Toyah found support from her mother and neighbour Charlie Ramsden (Clare McGlinn), who revealed that she had once been raped. Taylor told Inside Soap's Allison Maund that Charlie's advice really helped Toyah to start getting back on her feet. However, the process was hampered when Toyah received an anonymous phone call, which left her feeling [...] "extremely frightened". The phone call sparked [...] "a terrifying event" [...] in which Toyah's rapist was finally revealed to be her friend Phil Simmonds (Jack Deam). When Phil came round to comfort Toyah, she recognised his voice as he called out her name and realised that he was her rapist. While Toyah tried to escape, Phil grabbed her and held her hostage. Toyah's screams were heard by Peter, who broke the door down and knocked Phil unconscious. A show spokesperson commented that Toyah would be left to worry about whether Phil would deny the rape and be convicted.|$|E
2500|$|Over the years, {{confusion}} over {{the name of}} the township had become an issue for many residents. [...] A movement organized around the Dover Township Name Change Committee, founded by Mayor Paul Brush and supported by the Ocean County Chamber of Commerce, collected signatures to <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>name</b> change question on the ballot in November 2006. On Election Day, November 7, 2006, over 60% of residents voted to approve changing the name from the Township of Dover to the Township of Toms River. The name change campaign featured the slogan [...] "Toms River YES", signifying a yes vote for the name change, and the name was officially changed on November 14, 2006.|$|E
2500|$|The phrase [...] "girl power" [...] <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>name</b> to {{a social}} phenomenon, but the slogan was met with mixed reactions. The phrase was a label for the {{particular}} facet of post classical neo-feminist empowerment embraced by the band: that a sensual, feminine appearance and equality between the sexes need not be mutually exclusive. This concept {{was by no means}} original in the pop world: both Madonna and Bananarama had employed similar outlooks. The phrase itself had also appeared in a few songs by British girl groups and bands since at least 1987; most notably, it was the name of British pop duo Shampoo's 1996 single and album, later credited by Halliwell as the inspiration for the Spice Girls' mantra.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "shotacon" [...] is a Japanese bimoraic clipped {{compound}} of Shōtarō complex (Shōtarō konpurekkusu), {{a reference to}} the young male character Shōtarō (正太郎) from Tetsujin 28-go. In the anime and manga series, Shōtarō is a bold, self-assertive detective who frequently outwits his adversaries and helps to solve cases. Throughout the series, Shōtarō develops close friends within the world. His bishōnen cuteness embodied and formed the term [...] "shotacon", <b>putting</b> <b>a</b> <b>name</b> to <b>an</b> old sexual subculture.|$|R
2500|$|The Tunnel Rats formed after rapper Dax Reynosa {{performed}} at a graffiti equipment store Hex's Hip Hop Shop. After the performance, he invited {{about two dozen}} rappers to his house for an open mic. The performers came from racially diverse backgrounds, a mix of Latinos, whites, and blacks, groups which Reynosa says did not always get along then. Among the standout performers that night were Reynosa's cousin Jurny Big, his sister Zane One, the four-member group Future Shock (consisting of Ahred a.k.a. Redbonz, Ajax Starglider, Sojourn, and DJ Trey-Qel), and Shames Worthy (a.k.a. Raphi), all of whom came together to form the Tunnel Rats. Reynosa was inspired to name the group [...] "Tunnel Rats" [...] after his father, {{who served in the}} Vietnam War as a tunnel rat. Ahred, a member of Future Shock, stated in an interview that [...] "We just <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>name</b> to it and called it Tunnel Rats. In Vietnam, the tunnel rats were the guys who went underground {{to make sure that the}} tunnels were clear so the soldiers could go through. We considered ourselves as those guys going first to make the way clear for people to go after us." [...] Reynosa recounts that [...] "we never believed that we were called to emcee or rap, never.
