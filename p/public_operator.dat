40|$|Background: In Sweden, {{air traffic}} control is {{currently}} performed in a mo-nopoly with the state owned Luftfartsverket as the only sup-plier. A deregulation process has been initiated with the ration-ale of cost reductions, both for airports and airline passengers. Problem and purpose: Economic arguments have been predominant for this potential deregulation and the underlying assumptions are that private al-ternatives would improve efficiency and reduce costs. This has lead the authors to identify what private alternatives would do differently than the current <b>public</b> <b>operator</b> in order to offer these benefits. Method: To fulfill the purpose the authors have used a qualitative ap-proach {{based on interviews with}} the current <b>public</b> <b>operator</b> as well as a new potential private alternative. In addition to this, interest organizations and regulative agencies have been con-tacted and secondary data incorporated to provide a holistic perspective. Conclusion: The authors have identified differences in activities between a public and private alternative that would create an advantageous effect on the market. They are: a different management of re-tirement funds, prolonged retirement age, new compensation system, altered recruitment policy, a full utilization of staff and a seizing of non-value adding activities...|$|E

The decision rules establish in which configuration welfare is maximized and bring to light the relative inefficiency of the public sector.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} a transport system with two road links in a series that describes traffic patterns under various pricing regimes. We consider various mixes of road operation including private-public toll roads, free-private toll roads, and free- public toll roads. We derive the pricing rules and evaluate the economic welfare under alternative regimes. Inter-regional distribution of welfare is also discussed. It is shown that pricing rules applied by a <b>public</b> <b>operator</b> differ from those in a parallel network, and the relative efficiency of alternative regimes depends on the presence of road congestion. A mix of private and public toll roads attains higher economic welfare and lower disparity, especially in the presence of heavy congestion. © 2008 LSE and the University of Bath...|$|E
40|$|Private-sector {{involvement}} in the construction and operation of roads is growing {{around the world and}} private toll roads are seen as a useful tool in the battle against congestion. Yet serious concerns remain about exercise of monopoly power if private operators can set tolls freely. A number of theoretical studies have investigated private toll-road pricing strategies, and compared them with first-best and second-best public tolls. But most of the analyses have employed simple road networks and/or used static models that do not capture the temporal dimension of congestion or describe the impacts of tolling schemes that vary by time of day. This paper takes a fresh look at private toll road pricing using METROPOLIS: a dynamic traffic simulator that treats endogenously choices of transport mode, departure time and route at the level of individual travellers. Simulations are performed for the peak-period morning commute on a stylized urban road network with jobs concentrated towards the centre of the city. Tolling scenarios are defined in terms of what is tolled (traffic lanes, whole links, or toll rings) and how tolls are varied over time. Three administration regimes are compared. The first two are the standard polar cases: social surplus maximization by a public-sector operator, and unconstrained profit maximization by a private-sector operator. The third regime entails varying tolls in steps to eliminate queuing on the tolled links. It is a form of third-best tolling that could be implemented either by a <b>public</b> <b>operator</b> or by the private sector under quality-of-service regulation. Amongst the results it is found that the no-queue tolling regime performs favourably compared to public step tolling, and invariably better than private tolling. Another provisional finding is that a private operator has less incentive than does a <b>public</b> <b>operator</b> to implement time-of-day congestion pricing. ...|$|E
