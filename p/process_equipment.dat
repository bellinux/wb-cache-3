5|$|Welded {{titanium}} {{pipe and}} <b>process</b> <b>equipment</b> (heat exchangers, tanks, process vessels, valves) {{are used in}} the chemical and petrochemical industries primarily for corrosion resistance. Specific alloys are used in Oil & Gas downhole applications and nickel hydrometallurgy for their high strength (e. g.: titanium Beta C alloy), corrosion resistance, or both. The pulp and paper industry uses titanium in <b>process</b> <b>equipment</b> exposed to corrosive media, such as sodium hypochlorite or wet chlorine gas (in the bleachery). Other applications include ultrasonic welding, wave soldering, and sputtering targets.|$|E
5|$|Tantalum is {{also used}} to produce a variety of alloys that have high melting points, strength, and ductility. Alloyed with other metals, it {{is also used}} in making carbide tools for {{metalworking}} equipment and in the production of superalloys for jet engine components, chemical <b>process</b> <b>equipment,</b> nuclear reactors, and missile parts. Because of its ductility, tantalum can be drawn into fine wires or filaments, which are used for evaporating metals such as aluminium. Since it resists attack by body fluids and is nonirritating, tantalum is widely used in making surgical instruments and implants. For example, porous tantalum coatings are used in the construction of orthopedic implants due to tantalum's ability to form a direct bond to hard tissue.|$|E
5|$|As an {{industrial}} process, {{the cost of}} welding {{plays a crucial role}} in manufacturing decisions. Many different variables affect the total cost, including equipment cost, labor cost, material cost, and energy cost. Depending on the <b>process,</b> <b>equipment</b> cost can vary, from inexpensive for methods like shielded metal arc welding and oxyfuel welding, to extremely expensive for methods like laser beam welding and electron beam welding. Because of their high cost, they are only used in high production operations. Similarly, because automation and robots increase equipment costs, they are only implemented when high production is necessary. Labor cost depends on the deposition rate (the rate of welding), the hourly wage, and the total operation time, including time spent fitting, welding, and handling the part. The cost of materials includes the cost of the base and filler material, and the cost of shielding gases. Finally, energy cost depends on arc time and welding power demand.|$|E

Lower explosive limits for many organic materials {{are in the range}} of 1050g/m³, which is much higher than the limits set for health reasons, as is the case for the LEL of many gases and vapours. Dust clouds of this concentration are hard to see through for more than a short distance, and normally only exist inside <b>process</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|E

500|$|In 1930 the {{northern}} facade {{was given a}} proper entranceway with transomed doors and Doric columns below a frieze identifying the building as the Crane Museum. [...] Above this doorway a circular window was also added. [...] The slate roof and its support beams were also replaced in 1930, but without altering the exterior lines of the building. [...] A late 19th century brick addition to {{the east side of}} the building (not a part of the landmark designation) is screened from view by plantings.

2500|$|The [...] "total recycle" [...] {{concept has}} two main disadvantages. The {{first is the}} {{complexity}} of the flow scheme and, consequently, the amount of <b>process</b> <b>equipment</b> needed. The second is the amount of water recycled in the carbamate solution, which has an adverse effect on the equilibrium in the urea conversion reaction and thus on overall plant efficiency. The stripping concept, developed in the early 1960s by Stamicarbon in The Netherlands, addressed both problems. It also improved heat recovery and reuse in the process.|$|E

It is also used for cleaning waste discharge pipes under sinks and drains in domestic properties. Surfactants {{can be added to}} the sodium hydroxide solution in order to stabilize dissolved substances and thus prevent redeposition. A sodium hydroxide soak solution is used as a powerful degreaser on stainless steel and glass bakeware. It is also a common ingredient in oven cleaners.|$|E

2500|$|An {{integrated}} gasification {{combined cycle}} (IGCC) is {{a technology that}} uses a high pressure gasifier to turn coal and other carbon based fuels into pressurized gas—synthesis gas (syngas). It can then remove impurities from the syngas prior to the power generation cycle. Some of these pollutants, such as sulfur, {{can be turned into}} re-usable byproducts through the Claus process. This results in lower emissions of sulfur dioxide, particulates, mercury, and in some cases carbon dioxide. With additional <b>process</b> <b>equipment,</b> a water-gas shift reaction can increase gasification efficiency and reduce carbon monoxide emissions by converting it to carbon dioxide. [...] The resulting carbon dioxide from the shift reaction can be separated, compressed, and stored through sequestration. Excess heat from the primary combustion and syngas fired generation is then passed to a steam cycle, similar to a combined cycle gas turbine. This process results in improved thermodynamic efficiency compared to conventional pulverized coal combustion.|$|E
