5|$|Following the June 29, 1889 elections, several {{suburban}} townships {{voted to}} be annexed to the city, which offered better services, such as improved water supply, sewerage, and fire and <b>police</b> <b>protection.</b> Hyde Park Township, however, had installed new waterworks in 1883 {{just north of}} 87th Street.

After the 1889 annexation Chicago was able to leverage efficiencies as the largest United States city in area and second largest in population.|$|E
