5|$|Cultivars of Hippeastrum {{are popular}} indoor {{ornamental}} plants prized for their large brightly colored flowers (including red, pink, salmon, orange and white). As such {{they have a}} very important place in the floriculture trade for sale as cut flowers or <b>potted</b> <b>plants.</b> Although the market is dominated by the Netherlands, and South Africa, other areas of production include Israel, Japan and the United States (Florida). Brazil also produces 17 million Hippeastrum bulbs annually.|$|E
5|$|Levels {{become more}} complex as the player progresses, {{introducing}} different mechanics and {{new types of}} enemies. Each enemy type {{is dressed in a}} unique colour, allowing the player to recognise their movement patterns. Some enemies remain static or rotate on a single node, while others will patrol the board along a specific route. Later stages may require the player to collect keys located on the board and unlock doors that block access to the level objective. Trapdoors connect one location on the board to another and allow the player to move between them during a turn. Some nodes contain <b>potted</b> <b>plants,</b> the player will not be detected while occupying these nodes. Coloured disguises can be found and equipped to let the player walk past an enemy type of that colour without being detected. There are throwable objects that are used to disrupt and change enemy behaviour patterns. Firearms can also be found on certain levels, they are used to shoot targets or obstacles from a distance.|$|E
5|$|The Season Nine DVD {{contains}} {{a number of}} deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include: more scenes from the Q panel; Pete discussing what he learned working at Dunder Mifflin; Angela's sister, Phyllis, and Andy giving toasts at the wedding; more scenes with Erin and her biological parents in which they reconnect; further shots of the office members reminiscing about shared memories; and the office taking one of the <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> outside and planting it in actual soil. The episode originally was scripted {{to begin with a}} different cold open; it would have entailed a prank on Dwight by Jim, in which Dwight is led to believe that he is actually living in the Matrix, a computer-simulation from the eponymous 1999 film of the same name. The scene was either not filmed, or cut from the episode and not included with the other deleted scenes. A table read of it—along {{with the rest of the}} episode—was included as a bonus feature on the ninth season DVD.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the demand for <b>pot</b> <b>plants</b> for interior decoration at various points of sale in Poznan. The results were based on questionnaires filled by clients of three retail sale points with pot plants: flower shop, horticultural centre and building material market in Poznan and its surroundings. Collected information was analysed for a frequency of purchases, amount of money spent on <b>pot</b> <b>plants,</b> place of purchases, occasions for which plant was bought, preferences of buyers and pattern of purchases. Customers purchase plants in various points of sale from 7 to 9 <b>pot</b> <b>plants</b> per year, mostly in horticultural centres and in spring. Plants are used for interior decoration and are cultivated for many years, however cut flowers are more often chosen for a gift than <b>pot</b> <b>plants.</b> Whereas a significant part of building material market customers cultivate flowers <b>pot</b> <b>plants</b> for a short time, and they buy <b>pot</b> <b>plants</b> for a gift as often as cut flowers. Among plants with flowers Phalaenopsis and Anthurium are selected most frequently, and Zamioculcas and Yucca among plants with decorative foliage. While choosing plants, buyers are guided by the overall appearance and price. ...|$|R

5|$|When {{given the}} {{opportunity}} to host a public reception for President McKinley, fair organizers chose to site it in the Temple of Music—Louis L. Babcock, grand marshal of the Exposition, regarded the building as ideal for the purpose. The large auditorium was located close to the Esplanade, {{in the heart of the}} fair, and had doorways on each of its four sides. In addition to rows of chairs on the floor of the hall, it had spacious galleries. Babcock spent the morning of September 6 making some physical arrangements for the reception. Floor seating was removed to create a broad aisle, running from the east doors through which the public would be admitted, to where McKinley would stand. Once members of the public shook hands with McKinley, they would continue on to exit the building. An American flag was draped behind the President, both to screen him from behind and for decoration—several <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> were arrayed around his place to create an attractive scene. Besides its utility for other purposes, the ornate building was one of the architectural features of the fair.|$|E

25|$|As a soil conditioner: Where {{the native}} soil is heavy or sticky, gentle mixing of {{vermiculite}} - up to one-half {{the volume of}} the soil - is recommended. This creates air channels and allows the soil mix to breathe. Mixing vermiculite in flower and vegetable gardens or in <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> will provide the necessary air to maintain vigorous plant growth. Where soils are sandy, mixing of vermiculite into the soil will allow the soil to hold the water and air needed for growth.|$|E

In 2010 a one-year pilot program was approved which was later extended by six months. On February 6, 2012, Toronto City Council voted to permanently close the street to car traffic, from O'Keefe Lane to Bond Street. The space was official renamed Ryerson Square. It features seating areas, <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> and is used for a weekly farmers market, student group sign-up days and festivities associated with Ryerson’s week of welcome.|$|E
25|$|The common pests afflicting bonsai include insects both {{above and}} beneath the soil, and infections, usually fungal. A tree grown as a bonsai {{is subject to the}} pests that affect the same species full-grown, and also to pests common to other <b>potted</b> <b>plants.</b> Most pests are species-specific, so a {{detailed}} understanding of the specific bonsai species is necessary for identifying and treating most pests. The same materials and techniques used for other affected plants {{can be applied to the}} bonsai, with some relatively minor variation. Pesticide chemicals are usually diluted more for bonsai than for a larger plant, as a regular-strength application may overwhelm the smaller bonsai's biological processes.|$|E

If the land is fenced etc., gates must be left open to enable entrance. These rules apply to all outdoor agriculture, including private gardens and even outdoor <b>potted</b> <b>plants.</b> Plants inside a building are exempt. However, the Rabbis of the Mishna and Jerusalem Talmud imposed rabbinic ordinances on harvesters to ensure an orderly and equitable process and to prevent a few individuals from taking everything.

500|$|In pots, {{the species}} {{requires}} well-drained, sandy potting soil and bright, sunny conditions. Aloe plants can burn under too much sun or shrivel when the pot does not drain water. The {{use of a}} good-quality commercial propagation mix or packaged [...] "cacti and succulent mix" [...] is recommended, as they allow good drainage. Terra cotta pots are preferable as they are porous. <b>Potted</b> <b>plants</b> {{should be allowed to}} completely dry before rewatering. When potted, aloes can become crowded with [...] "pups" [...] growing from the sides of the [...] "mother plant". Plants that have become crowded should be divided and repotted to allow room for further growth and help prevent pest infestations. During winter, Aloe vera may become dormant, during which little moisture is required. In areas that receive frost or snow, the species is best kept indoors or in heated glasshouses.|$|E
500|$|Armillaria gallica can {{normally}} {{be found on}} the ground, but sometimes on stumps and logs. Mushrooms that appear to be terrestrial are attached to plant roots underneath the surface.

The species has also been found in the Western Cape Province of South Africa, where it is thought to have been introduced from <b>potted</b> <b>plants</b> imported from Europe during the early colonization of Cape Town. In Scandinavia, it is absent in areas with very cold climates, like Finland or Norway, but it is found in southern Sweden. It is thought to be the most prevalent low altitude species of Armillaria in Great Britain and France. The upper limits of its altitude vary by region. In the French Massif Central, it is found up to , while in Bavaria, which has a more continental climate, the upper limit of distribution reaches [...] In Serbian forests, it is the most common Armillaria between elevations of [...] Field studies suggest that A.gallica prefers sites that are low in organic matter and have high soil pHs.|$|E
