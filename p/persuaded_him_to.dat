He received classical music lessons, but was influenced by the jazz playing of Art Tatum, Teddy Wilson, and others after fellow pianist Erroll Garner, four years Marmarosa's elder, introduced him to their music. Marmarosa practiced a lot, until his left and right hands were equally strong.|$|E
5|$|Governor Henry Lee III of Virginia, {{a friend}} of Harrison's father, learned of William's {{situation}} and <b>persuaded</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> join the military. Within twenty-four hours of meeting Lee, eighteen-year-old Harrison was commissioned as an ensign in the U.S. Army, 1st Infantry Regiment.

5|$|The {{extended}} Robinson family established {{itself on}} a residential plot containing two small houses at 121 Pepper Street in Pasadena.

5|$|While Verdi {{was working}} on his second opera Un giorno di regno, Margherita died of {{encephalitis}} {{at the age of}} 26. Verdi adored his wife and children and was devastated by their deaths. Un giorno, a comedy, was premiered only a few months later. It was a flop and only given the one performance. Following its failure, it is claimed Verdi vowed never to compose again, but in his Sketch he recounts how Merelli <b>persuaded</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> write a new opera.|$|E

5|$|According to the Life of St. Theodore of Syceon, Domentziolus {{fell into}} a Persian ambush but was able to escape. In 604/605, he also {{surrounded}} Narses and his troops, and <b>persuaded</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> surrender on guarantees of his personal safety. Phocas, nonetheless, had Narses executed by burning him alive. At about the same time, Dara, an important Byzantine city in Mesopotamia, fell to the Persians. Khosrau was encouraged to cease simply raiding the Byzantine provinces, instead attempting to conquer them. In 607, he launched concurrent invasions on Mesopotamia and Armenia.|$|E
5|$|Betances {{was awarded}} the rank of Chévalier (Knight) of the Legion of Honor by the French {{government}} in July 1887, for {{his work as a}} diplomat for the Dominican Republic, and for his work as a medical doctor in France. He had been offered the award as early as 1882, but had repeatedly declined the honor out of humility, until friends from Puerto Rico <b>persuaded</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> accept it as a tribute to Puerto Rico, and not as a personal award. The French Legion of Honor (Légion d'honneur) is the premier order of France, and its award is one of great distinction.|$|E

The film's producers visited several cities in the United States and Canada; Thompson was cast based on a tape which his agent had sent and a follow-up audition after the first actor cast in the lead was forced to pull out. The film was shot over 30 days in Baltimore, Maryland and Trenton, New Jersey.|$|E

They <b>persuaded</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> give them their father's former copper mines at Besztercebánya (now Banská Bystrica in Slovakia) in 1494. Soon after, they leased the mines to John and George Thurzó for 10 years. They also regained Szklabonya (Sklabiná in Slovakia) from Anton Poki, a retainer of John Corvinus.

Although he initially declined the honour, Harold Wilson, the incumbent prime minister, wrote to him, then invited him and Plowright to dinner, and <b>persuaded</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> accept.|$|E
5|$|In January 1016, Mansur fled Aleppo {{after the}} citadel commander, Fath al-Qal'i, revolted and {{recognized}} Salih's emirate and Caliph al-Hakim's suzerainty over Aleppo. According to Aleppine chroniclers, the revolt was coordinated with Salih, who was restored {{his share of}} Aleppo's revenues and given custody of the mother, wives and daughters of Mansur; Salih immediately sent the women to join Mansur, but kept one of the latter's daughters, whom he married. Mansur's ouster and the subsequent disorder in northern Syria drove Basil to halt all travel and trade with Syria and Egypt, but Salih <b>persuaded</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> exempt Aleppo and the Kilab from these sanctions.|$|E

Max Newman withdrew from the project, believing that the development of computers required engineers and not mathematicians at this point, but Williams preferred to return to electrotechnics, leaving Kilburn in charge. He was assisted by Alan Turing, who arrived at Manchester in 1948. The Mark I incorporated innovations such as index registers, and combined CRTs with magnetic drum storage. Nine Mark I computers were sold by between 1951 and 1957.|$|E
5|$|Motohiro {{wanted to}} return to making anime after a long hiatus but he needed a charismatic script writer. Motohiro and his staff were {{surprised}} with Gen Urobuchi's contribution to the highly acclaimed anime series, Puella Magi Madoka Magica. Motohiro was fascinated by Madoka Magica; he read other works from Urobuchi, which <b>persuaded</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> talk to Urobuchi. In early 2011, Motohiro proposed to Urobuchi that the pair should work together.
