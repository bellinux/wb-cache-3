40|$|AIM: To {{study the}} role of Fas ligand (FasL) and Caspase- 3 {{expression}} in carcinogenesis and progression of gastric cancer and molecular mechanisms of relevant immune escape. METHODS: FasL and Caspase- 3 expression was studied in adjacent epithelial cells, cancer cells and lymphocytes of <b>primary</b> <b>foci,</b> and cancer cells of metastatic foci from 113 cases of gastric cancer by streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase (S-P) immunohistochemistry. Expression of both proteins in cancer cells of <b>primary</b> <b>foci</b> was compared with clinicopathological features of gastric cancer. The relationship between FasL expression in cancer cells and Caspase- 3 expression in cancer cells or infiltrating lymphocytes of <b>primary</b> <b>foci</b> was investigated...|$|R

When Blackburn became governor in 1879, the mortality rate of the almost one thousand inmates in the state penitentiary was over 7 percent. Scurvy caused by poor nutrition afflicted 75 percent of prisoners. Blackburn compared conditions at the penitentiary to the infamous Black Hole of Calcutta.|$|E

5|$|Following the war, {{construction}} resumed on roadways throughout Ontario. The expressway between Highland Creek and Oshawa {{was completed}} in December 1947, while other sections languished.

Despite the delays, highway minister George Doucett officially announced the plans for construction of the new trans-provincial expressway that year, with the Toronto to Oshawa expressway serving {{as a model for the}} design. Work on the most important link, the Toronto Bypass, began in 1951, but it would not open with that name.|$|E

During that decade, Roberts and William Branham criticized other prosperity ministries, arguing that their fund-raising tactics unfairly pressured attendees. These tactics were prompted {{in part by the}} expense of developing nationwide radio networks and campaign schedules. At the same time, leaders of the Pentecostal Assemblies of God denomination often criticized the focus on prosperity taken by independent healing evangelists.|$|E

40|$|Lewis lung {{carcinoma}} {{cells were}} {{implanted in the}} foot-pads of mice {{and the effects of}} the plasminogen-plasmin inhibitor tranexamic acid (t-AMCHA) and of the plasminogen activator urokinase on metastasis were examined by electron microscopy. The intravascular tumour cells were not associated with thrombus formation in either control or urokinase-treated mice. Polymerized fibrin deposition around tumour cells and thrombi composed of fibrin and platelets was observed only in the mice given t-AMCHA. This suggests that the inhibition of fibrinolysis by tACC caused fibrin deposition and thrombus formation around intravascular tumour cells, which prevented release of the cells from <b>primary</b> <b>foci</b> to form secondary tumours. On the other hand, fibrinolysis induced by urokinase prevented thrombus formation, and accelerated cell release from <b>primary</b> <b>foci...</b>|$|R
40|$|Ten new-born lambs were necropsied {{at various}} {{intervals}} after artificial infection with Rift Valley fever virus {{for the study}} of the sequential development of the hepatic lesions. During the late stage of the disease, the livers were slightly to moderately swollen and mottled yellow, orange-brown and red. Greyish-white foci, approximately 0, 25 - 0, 5 mm in diameter, were also scattered throughout the parenchyma. Microscopically, the liver lesions progressed from sparsely distributed acidophilic bodies and hepatocytes, revealing acidophilic degeneration and necrosis 6 - 12 h post-inoculation, to small randomly scattered <b>primary</b> <b>foci</b> of necrosis 12 - 24 h after infection. At 30 - 36 h, these <b>primary</b> <b>foci</b> were larger and more circumscribed. In addition, numerous acidophilic bodies and necrotic hepatocytes were dispersed throughout the markedly degenerated parenchyma. The terminal stage of the disease (48 - 53 h after inoculation), was characterized by massive hepatic necrosis in which <b>primary</b> <b>foci</b> of necrosis could still be recognized as dense aggregates of cytoplasmic and nuclear debris.

5|$|Nurkse's theory {{discusses}} how {{the poor}} {{size of the}} market in underdeveloped countries perpetuates its underdeveloped state. Nurkse has also clarified the various determinants of the market size and puts <b>primary</b> <b>focus</b> on productivity. According to him, if the productivity levels rise in a less developed country, its market size will expand and thus it can eventually become a developed economy. Apart from this, Nurkse has been nicknamed an export pessimist, as he feels that the finances to make investments in underdeveloped countries must arise from their own domestic territory. No importance should be given to promoting exports.|$|E
