50|$|<b>Photoplotters</b> {{are closely}} related to imagesetters. <b>Photoplotters</b> differ from their imagesetting {{counterparts}} in the type of controller used to produce the image, and in the resolution and absolute accuracy of the image, with <b>photoplotters</b> meeting much more stringent specifications than imagesetters.|$|R

50|$|A <b>photoplotter</b> is an electro-mechanical-optical {{machine that}} exposes a latent image on a media, usually high-contrast {{monochromatic}} (black-and-white) photographic film, using a light source under computer control. Once the exposing step is complete, {{the media is}} processed in a film processor using a developer solution, along with fixing, washing, and drying.|$|E
5000|$|Gerber also invented and {{introduced}} a novel form of plotter that used a controlled {{beam of light}} instead of an ink-pen, to draw digital graphics directly on photographic film. The world’s most accurate printing technology, the [...] "photoplotter" [...] reduced the cost and time of fabricating circuit board s and enabled production of more sophisticated, miniaturized, and multi-layered printed circuit boards and integrated circuits. The <b>photoplotter</b> [...] "revolutionized the production of printed circuit board artwork." [...] Ultimately, the company would provide a suite of numerically controlled and computer-based tools for design through inspection of circuit boards. Gerber’s computerized manufacturing process {{played a leading role}} in the consumer electronics revolution, from pocket radios to computers. The <b>photoplotter</b> was also used to manufacture over 75% of the CRT color television screens and the masters for the original Universal Product Code (UPC) barcodes.|$|E
50|$|Gerber’s {{plotters}} and <b>photoplotters</b> brought transformative computer-automation to the labor-intensive {{field of}} cartography, once {{the province of}} labor-intensive and highly skilled tasks and of cumbersome photographic processes.

50|$|Before EDA, {{integrated}} circuits {{were designed by}} hand, and manually laid out. Some advanced shops used geometric software to generate the tapes for the Gerber <b>photoplotter,</b> but even those copied digital recordings of mechanically drawn components. The process was fundamentally graphic, with the translation from electronics to graphics done manually. The best known company from this era was Calma, whose GDSII format survives.|$|E

50|$|Nearly any {{conceivable}} image can be formed. Photoplotters {{are used}} {{primarily for the}} production of PCBs (printed circuit boards) and IC packaging. Other application areas include chemical milling and specialized graphic arts. Photoplotting is the first step of making photolithography masks for printed circuit boards. In the PCB industry, these masks are called photoplots and are generally limited to features of 20 µm or more. Integrated circuits are made in a similar fashion utilizing photomasks with sub-micrometer feature sizes; photomasks are traditionally made by photoreducing <b>photoplotter</b> output.|$|E
25|$|Gerber {{is used in}} PCB {{fabrication}} data. PCBs {{are designed}} on a specialized electronic design automation (EDA) or a computer-aided design (CAD) system. The CAD systems output PCB fabrication data to allow fabrication of the board. This data typically contains a Gerber file for each image layer (copper layers, solder mask, legend or silk...). Gerber is also the standard image input format for all bare board fabrication equipment needing image data, such as <b>photoplotters,</b> legend printers, direct imagers or automated optical inspection (AOI) machines and for viewing reference images in different departments. For assembly the fabrication data contains the solder paste layers and the central locations of components to create the stencil and place and bond the components.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>photoplotter</b> was {{introduced}} by the Gerber Scientific Inc. in the 1960s. Early machines used a xenon flash lamp, and projected an image mounted in a rotating aperture wheel onto the photosensitive surface of the film or glass plate. The imaging head assembly traversed {{over the surface of}} the media without touching it to produce draws and flashes. Draws are vectors or arcs created by continuous illumination as the imaging head moves over the photosensitive surface. A flashe create single simple graphic in a location by shining light through an aperture of the appropriate shape at a fixed location.|$|E
5000|$|Gerber’s <b>photoplotter</b> was {{the first}} {{computerized}} product used to automate printing prepress and {{was the first}} imagesetter. In 1981, Gerber introduced the Autoprep, the first computerized system specifically for production printing, and the beginning of automated prepress. This system managed the whole digital workflow of a printing operation and addressed all aspects of prepress production, from pre-flight, trapping, and imposition to RIPing and archiving. In 1984, Gerber began developing Computer-To-Plate (CTP) technology. Gerber’s Crescent was the first commercially viable CTP Platesetter and was introduced in 1991. Observed Frank Romano, president of the Museum of Printing, [...] "Gerber pioneered computer-to-plate; and, today almost all printers and newspapers use CTP." ...|$|E
50|$|Originally, stereoplotters {{recorded}} {{the path of}} the flying light spot by directly scribing the path on a sheet of acetate or polyester coated with an opaque lacquer, which could be photographed to make the topographic map printing plates. If mistakes were made during contour tracing, the operator would daub some lacquer on the incorrect trace, allow it to dry and then try flying the light spot again. Current systems that use digital capture techniques allow simple erasure of part of the faulty data vector in computer memory, whereupon digitizing can resume. The digital database is then combined in a graphics program with annotations and symbols, ultimately being used to produce the map printing plates with a <b>photoplotter.</b>|$|E
50|$|Rubylith {{was used}} {{in the early days of}} {{semiconductors}} and integrated circuits. The physical layouts of the first generations of Intel microprocessors (the Intel 4004 and the Intel 8008 (nee 1201)) were first hand drawn on graph paper. A technician would then use a coordinatograph to precisely cut the rubylith and a knife to peel the appropriate sections away. The finished Rubylith mechanical masters were then photo reduced up to 100 times and then step and repeated on to glass plates for production use. Shortly after the 8008, Intel started using Calma's computer-aided design system that ran on a Data General minicomputer; the output masters may have stayed rubylith for a time, but other output options became available. Bell Telephone Laboratories, for example, had a high-resolution <b>photoplotter.</b> The integrated circuit industry left rubylith for better technologies.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} self-made laser <b>photoplotter</b> {{developed}} {{to serve the}} scientific and technical community in the task of high-resolution mask manufacturing and direct writing of diffractive continuous phase objects. In its current configuration (Figure 1), the laser <b>photoplotter</b> has demonstrated the next capabilities with binary masks: Mask size: up to 250 x 200 mm Critical dimension: down to 1. 5 µm, Absolute accuracy: 0. 6 µm. Writing strategy: vector-scan The equipment has been designed in a very flexible way: both vector-scan and raster-scan strategies {{will be available for}} binary masks, whereas raster-scan will be used for direct phase writing. The motivation which leads us to undertake this project is the necessity for flexible and in-the-house manufacturing of diffractive optics, micro optics, phase and amplitude diffraction gratings, masks for lithography and reticules. The main application of this technology (in reference with the research line of the promoting research group), is the continuous improvement of optical encoder and sensor technologies, as well as miniaturization of the same. Besides this, the results of the project present worldwide application capabilities. This is because diffractive optics, micro optics, diffraction gratings and high precision and resolution masks and reticules are key elements in many enabling technologies and industrial processes (for example MEM’s and MOEM’s, photonic devices, etc [...] ). The relevance of the results of this projects are even greater, if we take into account that there is no other installation in Spain for diffractive optics, micro optics and mask manufacturing with the intended capabilities of size (300 × 500 mm), critical dimension (0. 5 µm) and accuracy (± 1 micra/ 500 mm). The laser, contrary to standard systems, is a NGa semiconductor laser from Nichia, with a wavelength of 405 nm and cc power of 30 mW.

40|$|An all optical {{autofocus}} {{has been}} designed and tested for tight line width control in a high NA laser <b>photoplotter</b> system. The laser system is based in a GaN semiconductor laser with power 30 mW and wavelength 405 nm. The advantage of using this laser, despite the relatively long wavenlength, is compactness and easy for high frequency modulation. The autofocus system is based in a secondary 635 nm GaAlAs laser without need for wavelength, neither power stabilization. The two beams are delivered coaxially through the focusing lens {{by means of a}} dichroic beamsplitter. Focusing lens need no correction for chromatic aberration, as this is compensed by appropriate autofocus beam divergence. After reflection in the sample, the autofocus beam is separated from the returning writing beam and then guided to a collimation sensor, in which defocus of about 1 / 20 of the Rayleigh range of the writing beam can be detected and compensated by an analogue PID electronic control. Stable linewidth within 5 % is achieved with different numerical aperture focusing lenses...|$|E
40|$|One major {{hindrance}} to {{the advent}} of novel bio-implantable sensor technologies {{is the need for}} a reliable power source and data communications platform capable of continuously, remotely, and wirelessly monitoring deeply implantable biomedical devices. This research proposes the feasibility and potential of combining well established, ‘human-friendly' inductive and ultrasonic technologies to produce a proof-of-concept, generic, multi-tier power transfer and data communication platform suitable for low-power, periodically-activated implantable analogue bio-sensors. In the inductive sub-system presented, 5 W of power is transferred across a 10 mm gap between a single pair of 39 mm (primary) and 33 mm (secondary) circular printed spiral coils (PSCs). These are printed using an 8000 dpi resolution <b>photoplotter</b> and fabricated on PCB by wet-etching, to the maximum permissible density. Our ultrasonic sub-system, consisting of a single pair of Pz 21 (transmitter) and Pz 26 (receiver) piezoelectric PZT ceramic discs driven by low-frequency, radial/planar excitation (- 31 mode), without acoustic matching layers, is also reported here for the first time. The discs are characterised by propagation tank test and directly driven by the inductively coupled power to deliver 29 μW to a receiver (implant) employing a low voltage start-up IC positioned 70 mm deep within a homogeneous liquid phantom. No batteries are used. The deep implant is thus intermittently powered every 800 ms to charge a capacitor which enables its microcontroller, operating with a 500 kHz clock, to transmit a single nibble (4 bits) of digitized sensed data over a period of 18 ms from deep within the phantom, to the outside world. A power transfer efficiency of 83...|$|E
