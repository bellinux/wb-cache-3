The Effect of Adding Vitamin B 12 on Fe Folate Supplementation in Increasing Hemoglobin Level Among Post Caesarian Section Patients at RSU PKU Muhammadiyah Delanggu, Klaten. A Thesis for The Masters Program in Nutrition, Postgraduate Program, Universitas Sebelas Maret, Surakarta. 2009 Caesaria {{section is}} an {{important}} cause of maternal bleeding at <b>delivery.</b> <b>Post</b> caesarian section bleeding leads to anemia among lactating women that subsequently can {{affect the quality of}} mothers’ milk and maternal fatigue. The anemia problem stems from not only iron deficiency but also folic acid and vitamin B 12 deficiencies. This study aimed to determine the effect of adding vitamin B 12 on Fe folate supplementation in increasing hemoglobin level among post caesarian section women. This study was a double blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT). The target population was <b>post</b> birth <b>delivery</b> mothers who underwent caesarean section. The source population was <b>post</b> birth <b>delivery</b> mothers who underwent caesarian section at RSU PKU Muhammadiyah Delanggu, Klaten, Jawa Tengah. Sixteen post caesarian section mothers received Fe Folate supplement, while other 16 post caesarian section mothers received Fe Folate and vitamin B 12 for 60 days. The outcome variable was hemoglobin level (g/L) measured twice, before and after treatment. Confounding factors under consideration were age, intakes of iron, vitamin B 12, protein, energy, and folate, respectively during the study. The effectiveness of adding B 12 was analyzed by t test, using SPSS version 16. The analysis results showed {{no significant difference in the}} mean increase of Hb between mothers who received and who did not receive vitamin 12 supplementation (p= 0. 369). This study concludes that adding vitamin B 12 on Fe Folate supplementation is not effective in further increasing the hemoglobin level among <b>post</b> birth <b>delivery</b> mothers who underwent caesarean section.

500|$|The Meråker Line was {{of great}} {{economic}} and social importance for the villages it passed through. It allowed much quicker transport into Trondheim, and the station buildings became centers of community life. For the first time these places had telegraph stations and daily <b>post</b> <b>deliveries.</b> The expedient transport meant that many more people chose to travel into Trondheim, which gained an advantage over other towns, such as Levanger and Stjørdalshalsen, in becoming the regional center for trade. Especially [...] Stjørdalshalsen {{lost much of its}} importance for the villages up the valley Stjørdalen. For farmers, the railway made it possible to sell fresh dairy products to Trondheim, and even to Sundsvall. New markets, combined with good income during construction that allowed for investments in machinery, increased the revenue and profits for agriculture along the line. By 1900, 68 people were employed by the railway in Meråker alone.|$|R
