40|$|Retaining {{walls are}} widely used for {{stabilising}} earth slopes and supporting excavations. They often interact with soils which are unsaturated. However, retaining wall-unsaturated soil interaction has not been investigated in experiments and treated adequately in theories. In this research the very first experimental testing program to investigate aspects of how a rigid retaining wall interacts with unsaturated soils is conducted. Another first is the extension of slip line theory to unsaturated soils for the retaining wall problem. The research characterises the unsaturated silty sand soil used in the experiments, with mechanical properties investigated using triaxial compression tests, and hydraulic properties using pressure plate tests and mercury intrusion porosimetry. Observed strength gains due to suction are described successfully using the effective stress concept. Also, water retention and hydraulic hysteresis are successfully represented by a fractal-based water retention model. The research details the development and validation of a new testing facility and set of procedures for carrying out retaining wall model tests in unsaturated soils. This includes a new compaction technique employing a hand-held electric percussion hammer to prepare samples at targeted moisture contents and densities. Also, a system is developed to saturate commercially available vibrating wire piezometers for reliable suction measurements during testing. Furthermore, soil displacements are successfully determined using particle image velocimetry. Results of five retaining wall model tests are presented in full. For each a rigid retaining wall is rotated about its toe into a sample, compacted at different combinations of moisture content and density. Both density and moisture content are found to affect the loads the soil exerted on the wall, the <b>earth</b> <b>pressures</b> mobilised, the depths of passive thrusts, and suction variations as wall rotation occurred. Guidelines are given on how these aspects may be incorporated into retaining wall design. The slip line theory demonstrates that suction increases the limiting <b>passive</b> <b>earth</b> <b>pressures.</b> Suction also influences soil displacements as the wall undergoes a rotation increment. Although the theory can not capture discontinuities in the measured soil displacements, it does predict average values of <b>earth</b> <b>pressures</b> to a reasonable accuracy...|$|R

Design codes provide evaluation methods that provide hardly any insight in the actual development of excess pore pressures and the don’t consider soil structure interaction. There {{is a need for}} tools that include these aspects, since performance based design principles are more often adopted in earth- quake engineering. In this research effects of excess pore <b>pressures</b> on dynamic <b>earth</b> <b>pressures</b> and dynamic behaviour of an anchored are investigated. Different evaluation methods are analysed on their performance. Initially prescribed pseudo-static methods in design codes are applied, followed by a dynamic analysis using ﬁnite element model PLAXIS. After a broad literature overview of available pseudo-static methods and sensitivity analysis. A case study in Akita Port is adopted where two similar anchored quay walls were both hit by the Nihonkai Chubu Earthquake in 1983. One quay wall survived the seismic event, the other suffered severe damage. Damage was related to occurrence of liquefaction in the backﬁll. Pseudo-static- and dynamic analyses are applied to assess both structures. Performance of both analyses is evaluated and effects of liquefaction are investigated. Pseudo-static analysis of the quay wall without liquefaction are, after reduction of the seismic coefﬁcient, rea- sonably in correspondence with observations. Active <b>earth</b> <b>pressures</b> are well predicted, while <b>passive</b> <b>earth</b> <b>pressures</b> are overestimated. The relatively simple method is however suitable to give a ﬁrst indication of failure/non-failure of the structure. On the other hand the pseudo-static method is not capable to realisti- cally include effects of excess pore pressures. Large stiffness differences between layers lead to exaggerated bending moments and displacements, again passive resistance is overestimated. Since Mononobe-Okabe is a limit equilibrium method, it is not well able to capture progressive failure. By performing a dynamic analysis, using the ﬁnite element model PLAXIS, insight is obtained in the actual soil structure interaction. The Hardening Soil small strain (HSsmall) constitutive material model is adopted to model the static and dynamic behaviour of soil not vulnerable to liquefaction. A calibrated dynamic cal- culation lead to reasonable accurate for the case without liquefaction. Bending moment distribution and displacements are in line with observations. Different earthquake motions lead to relatively large spread in displacement of the structure, less differences are found for bending moment distribution. To include effects of liquefaction the user-deﬁned UBC 3 D-PLM constitutive material model is assigned to potential liqueﬁable layers. Liquefaction resistance depends on the type of soil and on the stress state of the soil. By calibrating the UBC 3 D-PLM model a reasonably accurately prediction of the onset of liquefaction can be obtained for the considered stress state. Performance of the model deteriorates for variation of the stress state, especially for initial static shear stresses. Therefore a calibration method is developed to get around this limitation. Initially zones with a speciﬁc stress state are identiﬁed around the structure. Subsequently the model is calibrated to accurately predict the onset of liquefaction for each considered stress state, leading to a calibrated model parameter set for each zone. After adopting all parametersets for each zone a calibrated dynamic calculation is performed of the system, leading to reasonably accurate results of the development of excess pore pressures around the structure. Calculated displacements and bending moments are in line with observations in the ﬁeld and the failure mode is well predicted. Insight is gained in the development of excess pore pressures in time at different locations. Leading {{to the conclusion that the}} UBC 3 D-PLM model is capable to reasonable accurately evaluate liquefaction and corresponding effects on an anchored quay wall. Finally link is made between the followed procedure and applicability of this procedure for performing a dy- namic analysis including liquefaction for one of the anchored quay walls in the Eemshaven in Groningen. Important aspects that are typical for Groningen are the location of the bedrock and corresponding transla- tion of the earthquake motion and characteristics of the motion.
