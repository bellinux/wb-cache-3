40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine effects and {{problems}} of the 2 ̆ 7 Grain for Green 2 ̆ 7 project of China, which progressed halfway through the onset, from the viewpoints both of ecological recovery and of changes in land use as well as rural subsistence economy. The 2 ̆ 7 Grain for Green 2 ̆ 7 project tries for ecological recovery of the upper reaches of the Huang-He and the Yangtze River, by <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> <b>grazing</b> and transformation of cultivated fields in steep slopes into afforested areas. This project aims at not only ecological recovery but also rural economic development, because improvement of peasant economy is regarded as a key for future sustainability of the forests. The authors used remote sensing analysis to examine the extent of ecological recovery after the onset of the project on the one hand, and conducted intensive field research in Beisongta Village, Ansai Province, Shanxi to investigate the extent of change of traditional land use and subsistence economy on the other hand. The result of remote sensing analysis showed marked recovery of land cover, that indicates the effect of afforestation and the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> <b>grazing.</b> Though peasant subsistence economy were greatly affected by the prohibition of sheep and goats grazing and decrease of cultivated land, hothouse cultivation which started at the same time as the project, seems to make up for them so far...|$|E

CCTC is sited on land owned by the Department of Energy (DOE) and Kirtland Air Force Base and managed by SNL. The survey covered 3, 760 acres of land, most of which is rarely disturbed by CCTC operations. Absence of grazing by livestock and possibly native ungulates, and relative to the general condition of private range lands throughout New Mexico, and relative to other grazing lands in central New Mexico. Widely dispersed, low intensity use by SNL as well as <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> <b>grazing</b> has probably contributed to abundance of special status species such as grama grass cactus within the CCTC area. This report evaluates threatened and endangered species found in the area, as well as comprehensive assessment of biologic habitats.

30|$|Another notable {{reason for}} the {{decrease}} in the daily average grazing time, mentioned by 89 [*]% of the study participants, is the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> transboundary <b>grazing,</b> as we have already noted. When asked about how grazing was managed {{in the past to}} ensure sustainable rangeland regeneration, 90 [*]% answered that they grazed across borders and boundaries. This practice was a natural (hima-like) protection and graze management system where herders moved from place to place based on a collective understanding of where not to graze each year. Today, however, such a system no longer exists, according to the participants in the study.|$|R
40|$|Xin Lu (2011) Reproductive {{ecology of}} three Tibetan waterbird species, with special {{reference}} to life-history alterations along elevational gradients. Zoological Studies 50 (2) : 192 - 202. Life-history theory predicts that birds nesting at higher elevations will have lower reproductive output due to ecological constraints. Higher-elevation birds should allocate more energy into individual offspring through producing fewer and larger eggs {{to allow their}} offspring to better survive the harsh environments. To test the prediction, I collected reproductive data on 3 waterbirds, the Mallard Anas platyrhynchos, Common Moorhen Gallinula chlorpus and Eurasian Coot Fulica atra, at Lhalu Wetland (3650 m in elevation), the largest marshland with macrophytes on the Tibetan Plateau. These birds became regular nesters after <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> yak <b>grazing</b> and reed harvesting in the wetland since 2003. Mallards laid eggs from mid-Apr. to mid-June, moorhens from early May to mid-June, and coots from mid-May to late June. Clutch size and egg size of these high-elevation waterbirds were smaller or intermediate compared to those of their lowland counterparts, partially supporting the prediction. The pattern might {{be associated with a}} balance between environmental harshness and allocation of body reserves {{in terms of the number}} of clutches produced annually, and the number and size of eggs within a clutch across elevational gradients. The high-elevation mallards and moorhens primarily used reeds Phragmites australis as nesting habitat (with 92 % and 68 % of nests located there, respectively), whereas coots preferred rushes Juncus effusu...|$|R

40|$|The {{impediments to}} the {{contracting}} of marriage are those circumstances expressly stipulated {{by the law}} whose existence incapacitates the contracting of marriage. The article present and analyzes the impediments to marriage according to articles 5 - 9 of the Family Code and to art. 273 - 277 of the Civil Code. Thus, we will see that according to art. 5 - 9 of the Family Code and to art. 273 - 276 of the Civil Code the impediments to marriage are: 1. {{the existence of a}} previous valid marriage (the state of bigamy); 2. the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> marriage between blood relatives; 3. the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> marriage between relatives by adoption; 4. the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> marriage between the legal tutor and the minor child; 5. the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> marriage of the mentally alienated people and of the mentally retarded people; 6. the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> marriage between the people who suffer from temporary lack of judgment; 7. the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> same-sex marriage. However, the provisions in the Civil Code only bring under regulation as an impediment the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> marriage between the persons who suffer from temporary lack of judgment. Art. 277 paragraph 3 in the Civil Code stipulates the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> the civil partnerships between people of different or same sex. the Family Code, the new Civil Code, impediments to the contracting of marriage, the existence of a previous valid marriage (the state of bigamy); 2. the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> marriage between blood relatives; the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> marriage between relatives by adoption; the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> marriage between the legal tutor and the minor child; the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> marriage of the mentally alienated people and of the mentally retarded people; the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> marriage between the people who suffer from temporary lack <b>of</b> judgment; the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> same-sex marriage...|$|R

40|$|This {{article will}} address the issue {{regarding}} <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> torture and its challenges at two levels: ASEAN and Indonesia. The <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> torture {{is considered to be}} a rule of “jus cogens” or peremptory norm as well as customary law. In addition the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> torture is absolute and non-derogable. Therefore. it entails some obligations for states whether or not they ratify the CAT. States have the universal obligations to prevent torture and inhuman degrading treatment in theirjurisdiction under international customary law. Since many of ASEAN countries do not ratified ICCPR, the AICHR have to implement the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> torture based on the customary international law. In addition, AICHR needs to monitor the national law regarding the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> torture. However. theAlCHR lacks of protection mandate and might not mnctioning well especially when dealing with the allegation <b>of</b> the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> torture or other human rights’ allegations within ASEAN jurisdiction. In Indonesia. the use of torture to get the confession is widely used by the police. Not all the perpetrators are brought to the Court of Law and are given an equitable sentences: although. Indonesia does have a regulation on <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> torture; the Criminal Code, the Law No 39 / 1999 concerning Human Rights. and the Law No. 26 / 2000 concerning Human Rights Courts. There is lack of competence of the Indonesian Human Rights Court to hear the violation cases.

40|$|The {{requirement}} <b>of</b> the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> reformatio in peius {{may arise}} {{taking into consideration}} several basic principles of the criminal procedure. The most important element <b>of</b> the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> reformatio in peius {{is that it is}} a legal guarantee for the defence to be able to file an appeal without the risk that a judgment might be altered to the detriment of the accused. Therefore, the accused will have confidence that the appeal will not do wrong to his interest. Nevertheless, the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> reformatio in peius can only be considered as a legal favour, but at the same time, many problems and counterarguments are being discussed regarding the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> reformatio in peius, such as the violation of fundamental principles and constitutionality.

40|$|The extent <b>of</b> <b>grazing</b> is {{affected}} by technical factors like stocking desity per ha grassland. Previous research suggested that farmers themselves also {{play a key role}} in determining the extent <b>of</b> <b>grazing</b> since they decide on the day to day management on their farm. However, the effect of social factors on the extent <b>of</b> <b>grazing</b> had not been quantified. The aim of this research was to study the technical and social factors that affect the extent <b>of</b> <b>grazing</b> on commercial dairy farms. Based on the Theory of Planned Behavior, is was hypothesised that the extent <b>of</b> <b>grazing</b> is influenced by the attitude <b>of</b> farmers towards <b>grazing,</b> subjective norms about grazing, perceived behavioural control <b>of</b> <b>grazing</b> and technical possibilities for grazing. An on-line questionnaire was sent to commercial dairy farmers in the Netherlands and 212 valid responses were obtained. Results were analysed using factor analysis and linear regression analysis. Combining technical and social factors in multiple linear regression model could account for 47 % of the variation in the extent <b>of</b> <b>grazing.</b> The results imply that future work on grazing in the Netherlands should take the mind-set of the farmer into account...|$|R

40|$|Resumé Aj The {{purpose of}} my thesis {{is to provide}} a {{detailed}} view <b>of</b> <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> torture in contemporary practice of States. De iure is the absolute <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> torture unquestionable. However situation de facto is more complicated. States are very inventive in finding ways of circumventing this absolute prohibition. Their justification for circumventing the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> torture may be called various things, such as diplomatic assurances, extraordinary rendition, interpretation of the definition of torture, national security, etc. Due to the limited scope of this work, I have selected the approaches of those States, which I find most worrisome and I will address them by presenting the practice of these individual States. This thesis has focused on an approach of certain European States, USA and Israel in their attempts to circumvent the absolute <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> torture. All examples support the topic of this thesis, however in different contexts. The thesis is composed of three core chapters. Chapter One deals with the legal status <b>of</b> the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> torture. Chapter Two affirms the absolute <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> torture by case - law of ECtHR in cases Chahal v UK and Saadi v Italy. Chapter Three is subdivided into three parts.
