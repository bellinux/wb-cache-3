One gram of poppy seeds {{contains}} up to 33 micrograms of morphine and 14 micrograms of codeine, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration in the United States formerly mandated that all drug screening laboratories use a standard cutoff of 300 nanograms per milliliter in urine samples. A single poppy seed roll (0.76grams of seeds) usually did not produce a positive drug test, but a positive result was observed from eating two rolls.

On November 30, 1998, the standard cutoff was increased to 2000 nanograms (two micrograms) per milliliter. Confirmation by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry will distinguish amongst opium and variants including poppy seeds, heroin, and morphine and codeine pharmaceuticals by measuring the morphine:codeine ratio and looking for the presence of noscapine and acetylcodeine, the latter of which is only found in illicitly produced heroin, and heroin metabolites such as 6-monoacetylmorphine.|$|E

The meat is frequently prepared with gravy and then eaten with dumplings, cabbage or potatoes. Vegetables are consumed daily, like carrots, peas, and cabbage.

Fish provides a main component of the Christmas Eve meal across Poland; since 1940 more popular are carp fillet, carp in aspic, [...] "carp Jewish-style" [...] (gefilte fish) etc. Wigilia is observed as a Black Fast meaning that most Poles abstain from eating meat on this day. Many households also prepare a great variety of special Christmas rollmops, matjas herring, <b>poppy</b> <b>seed</b> <b>cakes</b> (makowiec), dried fruit compote and other delicacies including edible Christmas ornaments. Common dishes are various fruits (dried apples, plums, apricots, dates, etc.) and salads.

40|$|The opium poppy, Papaver somniferum L., is {{the source}} of both poppy seeds and opium. The commercially {{available}} seeds are widely used as ingredients for various kinds of food. IgE-mediated sensitization to poppy seeds is rare, but, if present, clinical symptoms are usually severe. Cross-sensitizations between poppy seeds and other food allergens have been described with sesame, hazelnut, rye grain and kiwi fruit. We report the case of a 17 -year-old female with an apparently food-allergic reaction after ingestion of a <b>poppy</b> <b>seed</b> <b>cake.</b> Allergological workup revealed a poppy seed anaphylaxis and led to the identification of a novel cross-sensitization with buckwheat.

40|$|We {{measured}} morphine and codeine in commercially avail-able <b>poppy</b> <b>seeds</b> and in serum {{and urine}} samples from healthy adults who had ingested these <b>poppy</b> <b>seeds.</b> Four brands of black <b>poppy</b> <b>seeds,</b> examined by gas chromatogra-phy-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) with deuterated internal standards, contained from 17 to 294 of morphine and 3 to 14 g of codeine per gram of seeds. Morphine {{was detected by}} GC-MS in hydrolysates of serum as late as 24 h after ingestion, with a maximum mean concentration of 100 ng/mL (range 82 - 131) measured 2 h after the subjects ingested 25 g of seeds. Opiates were detectable (> 300 ig/L) in urine by enzyme-multiplied immunoassay (EMIT; Syva Co.) and by radioimmunoassay screening procedures {{for as long as}} 48 h after ingestion. The identity and quantities of morphine and codeine in <b>poppy</b> <b>seed</b> extracts and in hydrolysates of serum and urine were confirmed by GC-MS. Therefore a positive finding of morphine or codeine in blood and urine may sometimes be due to ingestion of <b>poppy</b> <b>seeds.</b> The recent increase in demand for drug testing in the U. S. has made more urgent the need for accuracy in drug screening, particularly because confirmatory tests are not always carried out and because the rate of false-positive results is substantial (1). Morphine being a major metabo-lite of both heroin and codeine (2), its presence in urine has been used as an indicator of opiate use (3, 4). However, recent reports (5, 6) from abroad have identified morphine in urine of persons who had ingested <b>poppy</b> <b>seeds</b> orpoppy-seed <b>cakes.</b> To confirm these reports and investigate this possible source of interference in opiate-screening tests, we mea-sured the concentrations of morphine and codeine in <b>poppy</b> <b>seeds</b> obtained in the United States and have examined serum and urine for content of these opiates after our subjects ingested <b>poppy</b> <b>seeds.</b> We also determined the duration of the effect of these concentrations on three widely used screening and confirmatory tests for opiates: EMI...|$|R
50|$|Christmas Day is a {{national}} holiday in Poland and most Poles spend the day feasting with their family. The Christmas meal is quite a feast, served in the evening on 24 December, offering large quantities of food. This Christmas Eve meal is called Wigilia. After the first star appears in the sky, everyone shares the Christmas wafer (opłatek) and wishes good things for the coming year. Then supper begins. The meal is meatless, honoring Catholic tradition. Many households also prepare {{a great variety of}} special Christmas dishes, typically numbering 12 in honor of the 12 apostles. Dishes include: stuffed carp, fried carp, herring in wine sauce, herring in cream sauce, fruit compote, vegetable salad, soup (beetroot, mushroom, or fish) with uszka, pierogi, peas and carrots, boiled potatoes, mushroom cream sauce, sauerkraut, and makowiec (<b>poppy</b> <b>seed</b> rolled <b>cake).</b> Most households leave an empty plate at the table for an unexpected guest. Straw or hay is usually on the table to symbolize the manger. During the season, pierniczki, or honey ginger cookies, are baked.|$|R

40|$|<b>Poppy</b> <b>seed</b> (Papaver somniferum l.) is an {{important}} oilseed, whose cultivation {{has a long tradition}} in the Czech Republic. <b>Poppy</b> <b>seed</b> grown in the Czech Republic has good quality and, therefore, is preferred to <b>poppy</b> <b>seeds</b> {{in other parts of the}} world. The objective of this paper is to characterize the current position of the Czech <b>poppy</b> <b>seed</b> production and foreign trade in the world. Czech Republic is the main world producer of <b>poppy</b> <b>seed</b> and price maker of the European and world prices. With regards to trade, the Czech Republic is also the main producer and seller both in Europe and in the world. The <b>poppy</b> <b>seed</b> crop grown in the Czech Republic is mainly produced for exports, because the domestic consumption consists of only between four and five thousand tons. Major export markets of Czech <b>poppy</b> <b>seed</b> are European countries with a population of Slavic origin or those influenced by Slavic cuisine. Another important markets are overseas countries, that were settled by Slavic immigrants. The paper stresses out the position of the Czech Republic as a major player in the world market with <b>poppy</b> <b>seed.</b> The paper provides analysis of the market position of the Czech production and Czech foreign trade participation. Development of production and trade, as well as some other factors affecting the <b>poppy</b> <b>seed</b> economy, are analyzed such as prices, hectarage, yields, volume of production and volume of trade.
