40|$|Any {{communication}} system requires {{at least three}} elements in order to function: a transmitting device, a receiving device, and a transmission line or propagation medium. Even the device children use, tin cans connected with string, consists or these three elements. One speaks into one can (transmitter), which vibrates at the same frequencies as the voice. The string (transmission path) picks up the vibrations of the can and carries them along its entire length. The other can (receiver) detects the vibration and reproduces the original sounds {{to a lesser extent}} depending on distance, tightness of string, type of string, etc. All {{communication system}}s depend on these three elements: transmitter, transmission path, and receiver. Communication systems can be divided into three fundamental categories: wired phone systems, radio systems, and carrier current systems. Sections 2. 2, 2. 3, and 2. 4, respectively, describe these systems and explain the basic principles of how each works. Hybrid systems are those systems that use various combinations of the three basic communication methods. Hybrid systems are described in section 2. 5. There are some other methods of signaling (stench warning, bell signaling, etc.) {{that can be used in}} underground mines to transmit or convey information. These systems, although they cannot be considered true communication systems since they do not provide voice or even two-way communication, are briefly described in section 2. 6. 2. 2 Wired Phone Systems Wired phone systems are all those that depend on a wire connection between phones with the wire carrying the voice signals. Figure 2 - 1 is a diagram of two typical wired phone systems. The top panel shows a simple single pair party line system. In this system each phone is connected to a common pair of wires, and a person speaking into one phone will be heard at all the other phones on the line. The bottom panel shows a multipair private line phone system. In this type of system, each phone is connected by its own individual pair of wires to a central switch or telephone exchange. To establish a call between two phones in this system, the lines between the two phones must be connected (switched together) within the telephone exchange. In early exchanges, the connections were made manually by an operator. These exchanges are called Private <b>Branch</b> <b>Exchanges</b> (PBX's). Today, equipment within the exchange can automatically connect each phone to any other phone in the system. These <b>exchanges</b> are called <b>Private</b> <b>Automatic</b> <b>Branch</b> <b>Exchanges</b> (PABX's). There are many different types of automatic exchanges. Some utilize switches to physically make each connection according to the number dialed. Other, more advanced exchanges are completely solid state and may even be computer controlled. [...|$|R

50|$|The term PBX {{originated}} when switchboard operators managed company switchboards manually using cord circuits.

40|$|The present {{explosion}} in digital communications and multi-user wireless cellular networks has urged {{a demand for}} more effective modulation methods, utilizing the available frequency spectrum more efficiently. To accommodate {{a large number of}} users sharing the same available frequency band, one requirement is the availability of large families of spreading sequences with excellent AC and CC properties. Another requirement is the availability of sets of orthogonal basis functions to extend capacity by exploiting all available degrees of freedom (e. g., temporal, frequency and spatial dimesions), or by employing orthogonal multi-code operation in parallel, such as used in the latest 3 GPP and 3 GPP 2 Wide-band Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) modulation standards by employing sets of orthogonal Walsh codes to improve the overall data throughput capacity. The generic Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) transmitter developed in this dissertation has originally been designed and implemented to investigate the practicality and usefulness of complex spreading sequences, and secondly, to verify the concept of non-linearly interpolated root-of-unity (NLI-RU) filtering. It was found that both concepts have a large potential for application in point-to-point, and particularly micro-cellular Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) and Wireless-Local-Loop (WLL) environments. Since then, several novel concepts and subsystems {{have been added to the}} original system, some of which have been patented both locally and abroad, and are outlined below. Consequently, the ultimate goal of this research project was to apply the principles of the generic DSSS transmitter and receiver developed in this study in the implementation of a WLL radio-frequency (RF) -link, and particularly towards the establishment of affordable wireless multimedia services in rural areas. The extended coverage at exceptionally low power emission levels offered by the new design will be particularly useful in rural applications. The proposed WLL concept can for example also be utilized to add a unique mobility feature to for example existing <b>Private</b> <b>Automatic</b> <b>Branch</b> <b>Exchanges</b> (PABXs). The proposed system will in addition offer superior teletraffic capacity compared to existing micro-cellular technologies, e. g., the Digital European Cordless Telephony (DECT) system, which has been consider by Telkom for employment in rural areas. The latter is a rather outdated interim standard offering much lower spectral efficiency and capacity than competitive CDMA-solutions, such as the concept analyzed in this dissertation, which is based on the use of unique large families of spectrally well confined (i. e., band-limited) constant envelope (CE) complex spreading sequences (CSS) with superior correlation properties. The CE characteristic of the new spreading sequences furthermore facilitates the design of systems with superior power efficiency and exceptionally robust performance characteristics (much less spectral re-growth) compared to existing 2 G and 3 G modulation standards, in the presence of non-linear power amplification. This feature allows for a system with larger coverage for a given performance level and limited peak power, or alternatively, longer battery life for a given maximum communication distance and performance level, within a specified fixed spreading bandwidth. In addition, the possibility to extend the concept to orthogonal multi-code operation provides for comparable capacity to present 3 G modulation standards, while still preserving superior power efficiency characteristics in non-linear power amplification. Conventional spread spectrum communication systems employ binary spreading sequences, such as Gold or Kasami sequences. The practical implementation of such a system is relatively simple. The design and implementation of a spread-spectrum communication system employing complex spreading sequences is however considerable more complex and has not been previously presented, nor been implemented in hardware. The design of appropriate code lock loops for CSS has led to a unique design with 3 dB performance advantage compared to similar loops designed for binary spreading sequences. The theoretical analysis and simulation of such a system will be presented, with the primary focus on an efficient hardware implementation of all new concepts proposed, in the form of a WLL RF-link demonstrator.

So, TE provided connections between COs of the local network, and access to the toll exchange. A function of the toll exchange is to establish connections for the long-distance and international calls. Last type of calls is served by the Gateway (GW). Processing of the local calls is performed by the COs and TEs.

The <b>Private</b> <b>Automatic</b> <b>Branch</b> <b>Exchange</b> (PABX) is introduced. the variety of telecommunications traffic as well as the practical requirements of a connection topology are discussed. The fundamental Network Optimisation Problem (NJP) is defined and analysed. Simple exhaustive methods of solution are considered together with partial solution algorithms and simplification methods. Centralised networks with and without concentrators are introduced. Extensions and modifications are proposed for some techniques and existing practical methods of dealing with the NOP are investigated. A number of new ideas are proposed for the practical solution of the NOP. Reduction methods are presented for replacing large unmanageable networks with smaller ones, on which optimisation can take place. Fixed topology techniques are introduced for initial tandem switch selection purposes and perturbation methods are considered which can be applied to such an initial solution. Lookahead methods of link removal are introduced for the purposes of determining the tandem interconnection network together with the traffic routeing strategy. A composite method is proposed incorporating all of these concepts and the results of a number of numerical experiments upon actual network problem; are presented. the extension of the proposed techniques to other areas of problem solving and optimisation is considered. In particular, a new method for the solution of the Euclidean Travelling Salesman Problem (ETSP) is presented.

These communication systems have their own control panels. In addition these systems use various communication technologies for transportation of voice and data. The operators have to deal with each of these control panels to operate these systems under normal and critical situations. In critical situations it can be crucial for the operators to act fast and correct to maintain control over the situation. This can be a demanding job especially when {{they have to deal with}} many different control panels simultaneously. Normally these control panels have similar layout with similar functions. This makes it possible to integrate these systems and to use one common integrated user interface to operate these systems. This thesis is confined to deal with the integration of the PA system and the UHF system. The Integrated Safety Systems (ISS) is primarily a safety system developed according to the NORSOK standard T- 100 [1]. Besides, no single error shall cause this safety system to become dysfunctional. One of the main tasks has been to evaluate a common communication technology for transportation of voice and data between the subsystems (PA and UHF) and the control panels. The different communication technologies we have evaluated for this purpose are various IP solutions, G. 703 [2] solutions and a combination of these two solutions. After evaluating six different proposals for a common transportation technology, we decided to continue our work with the combination solution.

40|$|Investigations {{into the}} {{transmission}} of real-time interactive speech over local area networks (LAN) in an industriai/commerciai environment to eventually obviate {{the need for a}} <b>private</b> <b>automatic</b> <b>branch</b> <b>exchange</b> and ultimately prepare the way for a single interactive integrated information system (PS) that provides work stations, which are networked via a LAN, with a fully interactive speech and graphics facility commensurate with the future requirements in computer integrated manufacturing (CIM). The reasons for conducting this programme of research were that existing LANs do not offer a real time interactive speech facility. Any verbal communication between workstation users on the LAN has to be carried out over a telephone network (PABX). This necessitates the provision of a second completely separate network with its associated costs. Initial investigations indicate that there is sufGcient capacity on existing LANs to support both data and real-time speech provided certain data packet delay criteria can be met. Earlier research work (in the late 1980 s) has been conducted at Bell Labs and MIT. [Ref 25, 27 & 28], University of Strathclyde [Ref 24] and at BTRL [Ref 22 and 37]. In all of these cases the real time implementation issues were not fijlly addressed. In this thesis the research work reported provides the main criteria for the implementation of real-time interactive speech on both existing and newly installed networks. With such enhanced communication facilities, designers and engineers on the shop floor can be projected into their suppliers, providing a much greater integration between manufacturer and supplier which will be beneficial as Concurrent and Simultaneous Engineering Methodologies are further developed. As a result, various LANs have been evaluated as to their suitability for {{the transmission of}} real time interactive speech. As LANs, in general, can be separated into those with either deterministic or stochastic access mechanisms, investigations were carried out into the ability of both the: (i) Token Passing Bus LANs supporting the Manufacturing and Automation Protocol (MAP) —Deterministic and (u) Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) LANs supporting the Technical Office Protocol (TOP) — Stochastic to support real time interactive speech, as both are used extensively in commerce and manufacturing. The thesis that real time interactive speech can be transmitted over LANs employed in a computer integrated manufacturing environment has to be moderated following the tests carried out in this work, as follows:- The Token Passing LAN presents no serious problems under normal traffic conditions, however, the CSMA/CD LAN can only be used in relatively light traffic conditions i. e. below 30 % of its designed maximum capacity, providing special arrangements are made to minimise the access, transmission and processing delays of speech packets. Given that a certain amount of delay is inevitable in packet switched systems (LANs), investigations have been carried out into techniques for reducing the subjective efifect of speech packet loss on real-time interactive systems due to the unacceptable delays caused by the conditions mentioned above...|$|E
