5|$|The {{intermetallic}} compounds of the alkali metals with the heavier group 13 elements (aluminium, gallium, indium, and thallium), such as NaTl, are <b>poor</b> <b>conductors</b> or semiconductors, unlike the normal alloys with the preceding elements, {{implying that the}} alkali metal involved has lost an electron to the Zintl anions involved. Nevertheless, while the elements in group 14 and beyond tend to form discrete anionic clusters, group 13 elements tend to form polymeric ions with the alkali metal cations located between the giant ionic lattice. For example, NaTl consists of a polymeric anion (—Tl−—)n with a covalent diamond cubic structure with Na+ ions located between the anionic lattice. The larger alkali metals cannot fit similarly into an anionic lattice and tend to force the heavier group 13 elements to form anionic clusters.|$|E
5|$|At a given temperature, each {{material}} has an electrical conductivity that determines {{the value of}} electric current when an electric potential is applied. Examples of good conductors include metals such as copper and gold, whereas glass and Teflon are <b>poor</b> <b>conductors.</b> In any dielectric material, the electrons remain bound to their respective atoms and the material behaves as an insulator. Most semiconductors have a variable level of conductivity that lies between the extremes of conduction and insulation. On the other hand, metals have an electronic band structure containing partially filled electronic bands. The presence of such bands allows electrons in metals to behave {{as if they were}} free or delocalized electrons. These electrons are not associated with specific atoms, so when an electric field is applied, they are free to move like a gas (called Fermi gas) through the material much like free electrons.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{rigorous}} {{definition of}} a nonmetal. They show more variability in their properties than metals do. The following {{are some of the}} chief characteristics of nonmetals. Physically, they largely exist as monatomic gases, with a few having more substantial (but still open-packed) diatomic or polyatomic forms, unlike metals, which are nearly all solid and close-packed; if solid, they generally have a submetallic or dull appearance and are brittle, as opposed to metals, which are lustrous, ductile or malleable; they usually have lower densities than metals; are <b>poor</b> <b>conductors</b> of heat and electricity when compared to metals; and have significantly lower melting points and boiling points than those of metals (with the exception of carbon). Chemically, the nonmetals have relatively high ionisation energy and high electronegativity; they usually exist as anions or oxyanions in aqueous solution; generally form ionic or interstitial compounds when mixed with metals, unlike metals, which form alloys; and have acidic oxides whereas the common oxides of the metals are basic.|$|E

5|$|Mercury is a heavy, silvery-white liquid metal. Compared {{to other}} metals, it is a <b>poor</b> <b>{{conductor}}</b> of heat, but a fair conductor of electricity.|$|R
50|$|Aquaria {{can also}} be heated {{by the use of}} heating mats which are placed beneath aquaria. Glass is, however, a <b>poor</b> <b>conductor</b> of heat and thus reduces the {{efficiency}} of this method of heating.|$|R
25|$|During McGlaughlin's {{years as}} a trombonist after his master's degree, he brought a full orchestral score to rehearsals, taking careful notes on how good and <b>poor</b> <b>conductors</b> handled {{difficult}} passages. In 1973, he asked Georg Solti whether he should pursue a conducting career; Solti encouraged him, but insisted he needed an orchestra to practice with. McGlaughlin formed three orchestras in Pittsburgh that year — an orchestra of college students, the Pittsburgh Camerata, and the Upper Partials Chamber Players. His practice paid off: In 1975, {{he was awarded the}} Exxon-Arts Conducting Endowment, and an assistant conductorship at the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra.|$|E
25|$|Ionic liquids {{are often}} {{moderate}} to <b>poor</b> <b>conductors</b> of electricity, non-ionizing (e.g., non-polar), highly viscous and frequently exhibit low vapor pressure. Their other properties are diverse: many have low combustibility, are thermally stable, with wide liquid regions, and favorable solvating properties {{for a range}} of polar and non-polar compounds. Many classes of chemical reactions, such as Diels-Alder reactions and Friedel-Crafts reactions, can be performed using ionic liquids as solvents. IL's can serve as solvents for biocatalysis. The miscibility of ionic liquids with water or organic solvents varies with side chain lengths on the cation and with choice of anion. They can be functionalized to act as acids, bases, or ligands, and are precursors salts in the preparation of stable carbenes. They have recently been found to hydrolyse, affording acidic or basic media in the aqueous milieu. Because of their distinctive properties, ionic liquids are attracting increasing attention in many fields, including organic chemistry, electrochemistry, catalysis, physical chemistry, and engineering; see for instance magnetic ionic liquid.|$|E
2500|$|Important {{classes of}} {{inorganic}} compounds are the oxides, the carbonates, the sulfates, and the halides. [...] Many inorganic compounds {{are characterized by}} high melting points. [...] Inorganic salts typically are <b>poor</b> <b>conductors</b> in the solid state. [...] Other important features include their high melting point and ease of crystallization. [...] Where some salts (e.g., NaCl) are very soluble in water, others (e.g., SiO2) are not.|$|E
50|$|Lead, in contrast, is a {{relatively}} <b>poor</b> <b>conductor</b> (among metals) with a resistivity of , about 9 times that of gold. Its skin depth at 50 Hz is likewise found to be about 33 mm, or times that of gold.|$|R
50|$|Like steel, {{stainless}} steel {{is a relatively}} <b>poor</b> <b>conductor</b> of electricity, with significantly lower electrical conductivity than copper. Other metals in contact with {{stainless steel}}, particularly in a damp or acidic environment, may suffer galvanic corrosion even though the stainless metal may be unaffected.|$|R
50|$|Another {{important}} factor is humidity. Water is a <b>poor</b> <b>conductor</b> of heat, thus if clothes are damp — because of sweat, rain, or immersion — water replaces {{some or all}} of the air between the fibres of the clothing, causing thermal loss through conduction and/or evaporation.|$|R
2500|$|A team of US {{scientists}} {{developed a}} method of predicting lahars. [...] Their method was developed by analyzing rocks on Mt. Rainier in Washington. [...] The warning system depends on noting the differences between fresh rocks and older ones. [...] Fresh rocks are <b>poor</b> <b>conductors</b> of electricity and become hydrothermically altered by water and heat. [...] Therefore, if they know {{the age of the}} rocks, and therefore the strength of them, they can predict the pathways of a lahar. A system of Acoustic Flow Monitors (AFM) has also been emplaced on Mount Rainier to analyze ground tremors that could result in a lahar, providing an earlier warning.|$|E
2500|$|A [...] (GEC) is used {{to connect}} the system {{grounded}} ("neutral") conductor, or the equipment to a grounding electrode, or a point on the grounding electrode system. This is called [...] "system grounding" [...] and most electrical systems are required to be grounded. The U.S. NEC and the UK's BS 7671 list systems that are required to be grounded. [...] According to the NEC, the purpose of connecting an electrical system to the physical ground (earth) is to limit the voltage imposed by lightning events and contact with higher voltage lines, and also for voltage stabilizion. In the past, water supply pipes were used as grounding electrodes, but due to {{the increased use of}} plastic pipes, which are <b>poor</b> <b>conductors,</b> the use of an actual grounding electrode is required. This type of ground applies to radio antennas and to lightning protection systems.|$|E
2500|$|In figure 1, x equals {{half the}} degree of {{polymerization}} (DP). Leucoemeraldine with n = 1, m = 0 is the fully reduced state. Pernigraniline is the fully oxidized state (n = 0, m = 1) with imine links instead of amine links. Studies have shown that most forms of polyaniline {{are one of the}} three states or physical mixtures of these components. The emeraldine (n = m = 0.5) form of polyaniline, often referred to as emeraldine base (EB), is neutral, if doped (protonated) it is called emeraldine salt (ES), with the imine nitrogens protonated by an acid. Protonation helps to delocalize the otherwise trapped diiminoquinone-diaminobenzene state. Emeraldine base is regarded as the most useful form of polyaniline due to its high stability at room temperature and the fact that, upon doping with acid, the resulting emeraldine salt form of polyaniline is highly electrically conducting. [...] Leucoemeraldine and pernigraniline are <b>poor</b> <b>conductors,</b> even when doped with an acid.|$|E
50|$|Electric motors contain coils {{to produce}} the {{required}} magnetic fields. For a given size of motor frame, high conductivity material allows the coils to be smaller {{to achieve the same}} level of loss due to coil resistance. <b>Poorer</b> <b>conductors</b> generate more waste heat when transferring electrical energy into kinetic energy.|$|R
50|$|The Downs cell uses {{a carbon}} anode and an iron cathode. The {{electrolyte}} is sodium chloride {{that has been}} heated to the liquid state. Although solid sodium chloride is a <b>poor</b> <b>conductor</b> of electricity, when molten the sodium and chloride ions are mobilized, which become charge carriers and allow conduction of electric current.|$|R
5|$|Titanium {{is not as}} hard as some {{grades of}} {{heat-treated}} steel; it is non-magnetic and a <b>poor</b> <b>conductor</b> of heat and electricity. Machining requires precautions, because the material can gall unless sharp tools and proper cooling methods are used. Like steel structures, those made from titanium have a fatigue limit that guarantees longevity in some applications.|$|R
2500|$|Modern day atom probe {{tomography}} (APT) uses a position-sensitive detector {{to deduce}} the lateral location of atoms. The {{idea of the}} APT, inspired by J. A. Panitz's Field Desorption Spectrometer patent, was developed by Mike Miller starting in 1983 and culminated with the first prototype in 1986. Various refinements {{were made to the}} instrument, including the use of a so-called position-sensitive (PoS) detector by Alfred Cerezo, Terence Godfrey, and George D. W. Smith at Oxford University in 1988. The Tomographic Atom Probe (TAP), developed by researchers at the University of Rouen in France in 1993, introduced a multichannel timing system and multianode array. Both instruments (PoSAP and TAP) were commercialized by Oxford Nanoscience and CAMECA respectively. Since then, there have been many refinements to increase the field of view, mass and position resolution, and data acquisition rate of the instrument. [...] The Local Electrode Atom Probe was first introduced in 2003 by Imago Scientific Instruments. [...] In 2005, the commercialization of the pulsed laser atom probe (PLAP) expanded the avenues of research from highly conductive materials (metals) to <b>poor</b> <b>conductors</b> (semiconductors like silicon) and even insulating materials. [...] AMETEK acquired CAMECA in 2007 and Imago Scientific Instruments (Madison, WI) in 2010, making the company the sole commercial developer of APTs with more than 90 instruments installed around the world in 2016.|$|E
2500|$|Proliferation {{risk from}} {{reprocessing}} - Effective reprocessing implies a proliferation risk. LFTRs {{could be used}} to handle plutonium from other reactors as well. However, as stated above, plutonium is chemically difficult to separate from thorium and plutonium cannot be used in bombs if diluted in large amounts of thorium. In addition, the plutonium produced by the thorium fuel cycle is mostly Pu-238, which produces high levels of spontaneous neutrons and decay heat that make it impossible to construct a fission bomb with this isotope alone, and extremely difficult to construct one containing even very small percentages of it. The heat production rate of 567W/kg means that a bomb core of this material would continuously produce several kilowatts of heat. The only cooling route is by conduction through the surrounding high explosive layers, which are <b>poor</b> <b>conductors.</b> This creates unmanageably high temperatures that would destroy the assembly. The spontaneous fission rate of 1204kBq/g is over twice that of Pu-240. Even very small percentages of this isotope would reduce bomb yield drastically by [...] "predetonation" [...] due to neutrons from spontaneous fission starting the chain reaction causing a [...] "fizzle" [...] rather than an explosion. Reprocessing itself involves automated handling in a fully closed and contained hot cell, which complicates diversion. Compared to today's extraction methods such as PUREX, the pyroprocesses are inaccessible and produce impure fissile materials, often with large amounts of fission product contamination. While not a problem for an automated system, it poses severe difficulties for would-be proliferators.|$|E
6000|$|... "Those {{ideas about}} {{increasing}} heat at increasing depths are old-fashioned, Margaret," [...] he said. [...] "Recent science {{has given us}} better theories. It is known that there is great heat {{in the interior of}} the earth, and it is also known that the transmission of this heat towards the surface depends upon the conductivity of the rocks in particular locations. In some places the heat comes very near the surface, and in others it is very, very far down. More than that, the temperature may rise as we go down into the earth and afterwards fall again. There may be a stratum of close-grained rock, possibly containing metal, coming up from the interior in an oblique direction and bringing the heat towards the surface; then below that there may be vast regions of other rocks which do not readily conduct heat, and which do not originate in heated portions of the earth's interior. When we reach these, we must find the temperature lower, as a matter of course. Now I have really done this. A little over five miles down my thermometer registered ninety-one, and after that it began to fall a little. But the rocks under us are <b>poor</b> <b>conductors</b> of heat; and, moreover, it is highly probable that they have no near communication with the source of internal heat." ...|$|E

The difference was attributed to his taking a fall after the first, which left his arms in a sling.|$|R

25|$|Aerogels {{are good}} thermal {{insulators}} because they almost nullify 2 {{of the three}} methods of heat transfer – conduction (they are mostly composed of insulating gas) and convection (the microstructure prevents net gas movement). They are good conductive insulators because they are composed almost entirely of gases, which are very <b>poor</b> heat <b>conductors.</b> (Silica aerogel is an especially good insulator because silica is also a <b>poor</b> <b>conductor</b> of heat; a metallic or carbon aerogel, on the other hand, would be less effective.) They are good convective inhibitors because air cannot circulate through the lattice. Aerogels are poor radiative insulators because infrared radiation (which transfers heat) passes through them.|$|R

50|$|Very {{typically}} most of {{the temperature}} drop occurs in the gas boundary layer since gases are relatively <b>poor</b> <b>conductors.</b> This boundary layer can be destroyed however by combustion instabilities, and wall failure can follow very soon afterwards.|$|E
50|$|Most hair dryers {{consist of}} {{electric}} heating coils and a fan (usually {{powered by a}} universal motor). The heating element in most dryers is a bare, coiled nichrome wire that is wrapped around mica insulators. Nichrome wire is used in heating elements because of two important properties: It is a <b>poor</b> <b>conductor</b> of electricity {{and it does not}} oxidize when heated.|$|R
50|$|These intumescents {{produce a}} light char, {{which is a}} <b>poor</b> <b>conductor</b> of heat, thus {{retarding}} heat transfer. Typically the light char consist of microporous carbonaceous foam formed by a chemical reaction of three main components: Ammonium polyphosphate, Pentaerythritol and Melamine. The reaction {{takes place in a}} matrix formed by the molten binder which is typically based on vinyl acetate copolymers or styrene acrylates.|$|R
50|$|Cookware and {{bakeware}} may be clad in stainless steels, {{to enhance}} their cleanability and durability, and to permit their use in induction cooking (this requires a magnetic grade of stainless steel, such as 432). Because stainless steel is a <b>poor</b> <b>conductor</b> of heat, it is often used as a thin surface cladding over a core of copper or aluminum, which conduct heat more readily.|$|R
5000|$|However, in very <b>poor</b> <b>conductors,</b> at {{sufficiently}} high frequencies,the factor {{under the}} large radical increases. At frequencies {{much higher than}} [...] it can be shown that the skin depth, rather than continuing to decrease, approaches an asymptotic value: ...|$|E
5000|$|Solid-phase {{electrical}} conductivity: Variable, {{depending on}} the nature of the bonding: network solids in which all electrons are used for sigma bonds (e.g. diamond, quartz) are <b>poor</b> <b>conductors,</b> as there are no delocalized electrons. However, network solids with delocalized pi bonds (e.g. graphite) or dopants can exhibit metal-like conductivity.|$|E
50|$|Modacrylics are <b>poor</b> <b>conductors</b> of heat. The fabrics are soft, {{warm and}} {{resilient}} but {{are prone to}} pilling and matting.

They also have great dimensional stability and high elastic recovery, which gives them the ability to hold their shape.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we analyze a typical shape {{optimization}} problem in two-dimensional conduc-tivity. We study relaxation for this problem itself. We also analyze {{the question of}} the approximation of this problem by the two-phase optimal design problems obtained when we fill out the holes that we want to design in the original problem by a very <b>poor</b> <b>conductor,</b> that we make to converge to zero...|$|R
50|$|This {{departure}} from the usual formula only applies for materials of rather low conductivity and at frequencies where the vacuum wavelength is not {{much larger than the}} skin depth itself. For instance, bulk silicon (undoped) is a <b>poor</b> <b>conductor</b> and has a skin depth of about 40 meters at 100 kHz (&lambda; = 3000 m). However, as the frequency is increased well into the megahertz range, its skin depth never falls below the asymptotic value of 11 meters. The conclusion is that in <b>poor</b> solid <b>conductors</b> such as undoped silicon, the skin effect doesn't need {{to be taken into account}} in most practical situations: any current is equally distributed throughout the material's cross-section regardless of its frequency.|$|R
50|$|Movement {{of metals}} being {{soldered}} before the solder has cooled {{will cause a}} highly unreliable cracked joint. In electronics soldering terminology {{this is known as}} a 'dry' joint. It has a characteristically dull or grainy appearance immediately after the joint is made, rather than being smooth, bright and shiny. This appearance is caused by crystallization of the liquid solder. A dry joint is weak mechanically and a <b>poor</b> <b>conductor</b> electrically.|$|R
