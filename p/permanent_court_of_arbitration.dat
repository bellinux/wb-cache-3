50|$|In 1916, Finlay became Lord Chancellor in Lloyd George's {{coalition}} government, {{being at}} the same time created Baron Finlay, of Nairn in the County of Nairn. It is generally thought that Finlay was a temporary appointment: Lloyd George excluded him from the War Cabinet and insisted that he forego the Â£5,000 pension given to retired lord chancellors. He sat on the Woolsack for three years, and in 1919, on his retirement, was created Viscount Finlay, of Nairn in the County of Nairn.

50|$|One {{reason was}} that the British {{government}} had at that point to find a role for Abdullah, after his brother Faisal had lost his control in Syria and been given {{the role of the}} king of Iraq. The British consequently made Abdullah emir of the newly created Transjordan. At first, Abdullah was displeased with the territory given to him, and hoped it was only a temporary allocation, to be replaced by Syria or Palestine. The <b>Permanent</b> <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> International Justice and an International <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arbitration</b> established by the Council of the League of Nations handed down rulings in 1925 which determined that Palestine and Transjordan were newly created successor states of the Ottoman Empire as defined by international law.|$|R
25|$|Furthermore, Eritrea's {{diplomatic}} relations with Djibouti were briefly severed during the border war with Ethiopia in 1998 due to a dispute over Djibouti's intimate relation with Ethiopia during the war but were restored and normalized in 2000.

25|$|In 2004 Belgium {{requested}} a reopening of the Iron Rhine railway. This {{was the result}} of the increasing transport of goods between the port of Antwerp and the German Ruhr Area.

The Belgian request was based on the treaty of 1839, and the Iron Rhine Treaty of 1873. After a series of failed negotiations, the Belgian and Dutch governments agreed to take the issue to the <b>Permanent</b> <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arbitration</b> and respect its ruling in the case.|$|E

25|$|As {{discussed}} above, the Meiji {{government was}} unwilling to allow foreigners to own land, and instead lent it to them on a perpetual lease. These leases continued even after {{the return of the}} settlement to Japan, but Japan began a policy of taxing the buildings on the land. The foreigners were opposed to this {{on the grounds that they}} were already being taxed on the land itself, and so were being subjected to double taxation, and in 1902 the Japanese government presented the case to the <b>Permanent</b> <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arbitration.</b> In 1905, Japan's plea was discarded, and Japan was disallowed from levying any taxes on buildings on the land under perpetual lease.|$|E
25|$|An {{international}} {{court had}} long been proposed; Pierre Dubois suggested it in 1305 and Ãmeric CrucÃ© in 1623. An idea of an international court of justice arose in the political world at the First Hague Peace Conference in 1899, where it was declared that arbitration between states was the easiest solution to disputes, providing a temporary panel of judges to arbitrate in such cases, the <b>Permanent</b> <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arbitration.</b> At the Second Hague Peace Conference in 1907, a draft convention for a permanent Court of Arbitral Justice was written although disputes and other pressing business at the Conference meant that such a body was never established, owing to difficulties agreeing on a procedure to select the judges. The outbreak of the First World War, and, in particular, its conclusion {{made it clear to}} many academics that some kind of world court was needed, and it was widely expected that one would be established. Article 14 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, created after the Treaty of Versailles, allowed the League to investigate setting up an international court. In June 1920, an Advisory Committee of jurists appointed by the League of Nations finally established a working guideline for the appointment of judges, and the Committee was then authorised to draft a constitution for a permanent court not of arbitration but of justice. The Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice was accepted in Geneva on December 13, 1920.|$|E
25|$|It {{was also}} in Paris that Acharya's {{thoughts}} were first turned towards socialism. This {{was similar to the}} lines of thought that appeared in the Indian revolutionary circles in Europe, especially in France, at this time. He was introduced to the Socialist circle in Paris in 1910, and enjoyed the congenial atmosphere and the thoughts and ideas that he shared. It was also {{with the help of the}} Paris Socialist circle, notably Jean Longuet, that the Paris Indian Society- which included Acharya, Har Dayal, Madam Cama and other notable names- brought pressure on the French Government when Savarkar was rearrested at Marseilles after escaping from a ship that was deporting him to India. Acharya made the most of the available press freedom and the socialist platform to press for the re-extradition of his erstwhile leader to France and build French public opinion in support of such moves. Under public pressure at home, the French Government conceded to make such a request to Britain. The matter was ultimately settled in the <b>Permanent</b> <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arbitration</b> at the Hague, which ruled in favour of Britain. Acharya became extensively involved in the socialist movement. The Paris Indian Society at this time grew to be one of the most powerful Indian organisations outside India at the time, and grew to initiate contacts with not only French Socialists, but also those in continental Europe. It sent delegates at this time to the International Socialist Congress in August 1910, where Shyamji Krishna Varma and V.V.S. Iyer succeeded in having a resolution passed demanding Savarkar's release and his extradition to France. It also succeeded in bringing to the attention of the organisation the state of affairs in India.|$|E

500|$|Wilson had {{stated that}} the 1920 {{election}} would be a [...] "great and solemn referendum" [...] on the League of Nations, {{making it difficult for}} Cox to maneuver on the issueâalthough Roosevelt strongly supported the League, Cox was less enthusiastic.

This was general enough to satisfy most Republicans, and only a few bolted the party over this issue. By October, Cox had realized there was widespread public opposition to Article X, and stated that reservations to the treaty might be necessary; this shift allowed Harding to say no more on the subject.|$|E
