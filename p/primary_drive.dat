40|$|This paper {{discusses}} essential motivational representations {{necessary for}} a comprehensive computational cognitive architecture. It hypothesizes the need for implicit drive representations, as well as explicit goal representations. Drive representations consist of <b>primary</b> <b>drives</b> — both low-level <b>primary</b> <b>drives</b> (concerned mostly with basic physiological needs) and high-level <b>primary</b> <b>drives</b> (concerned more with social needs), as well as derived (secondary) drives. On the basis of drives, explicit goals may be generated on the fly during an agent’s interaction with various situations. These motivational representations help to make cognitive architectural models more comprehensive and provide deeper explanations of psychological processes. This work represents a step forward in making computational cognitive architectures better reflections {{of the human mind}} and all its motivational complexity and intricacy. ...|$|R

500|$|Bowlby {{departed}} from psychoanalytical theory which saw the gratification of sensory needs {{as the basis}} for the relationship between infant and mother. Food was seen as the <b>primary</b> <b>drive</b> and the relationship, or [...] "dependency" [...] was secondary. He had already found himself in conflict with dominant Kleinian theories that children's emotional problems are almost entirely due to fantasies generated from internal conflict between aggressive and libidinal drives, rather than to events in the external world. (His breach with the psychoanalysts only became total and irreparable after his later development of attachment theory incorporating ethological and evolutionary principles, when he was effectively ostracised). Bowlby also broke with social learning theory's view of dependency and reinforcement. Bowlby proposed instead that to thrive emotionally, children needed a close and continuous caregiving relationship.|$|E
2500|$|Designed by Charles B. Franklin, the Scout was {{introduced}} in October 1919 as a 1920 model.

2500|$|Not {{unlike other}} Harley-Davidson engines, the unit {{construction}} {{left and right}} engine cases split vertically, and formed four cavities: a center front crankcase, a center rear gearbox, a right side cavity gearcase [...] for the timing train, where the four camshafts are housed, and a left cavity for the three row <b>primary</b> <b>drive</b> chain. A row of four camshafts had also been used on the KR racers, inherited from the sidevalve Model WL, and even earlier Model D of 1929. While the single camshaft of other Harley-Davidson designs was cheaper to manufacture, and quieter, four cams allowed better performance, such as greater flexibility in adjusting the cam timing, and the short single camshafts are durable, and give the pushrods a straighter path to the rocker arms.|$|E

Over the winter of 18851886 the belt drive was upgraded to a two-stage, two-speed transmission with a belt <b>primary</b> <b>drive</b> and the final drive using a ring gear on the back wheel.

Their acceptance of a variant of slavery and ideology of forced unity lends a darker side to the faction. [...] UEF units are blueish, and somewhat blocky in form, reflecting the UEF's <b>primary</b> <b>drive</b> to maintain peace and order throughout the galaxy, and bring all of humanity back under one government.

Doris Kraeling and Byron Campbell experimented to determine if “reduction would be more effective as a reinforcer if the initial drive were low than if the initial drive were high.” Their findings are quite surprising: “Changes in stimuli are more discriminable at low levels of stimulus intensity than at higher levels of stimulus intensity”.|$|R
