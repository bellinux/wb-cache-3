5000|$|When a <b>card</b> <b>holder</b> buys {{something}} from a vendor and expects the card to be charged only once, a vendor may charge the card a small amount multiple times at infrequent intervals such as monthly or annually until the card expires. The vendor may state in the fine print that the customer is now a [...] "member" [...] and the membership will be renewed periodically unless the <b>card</b> <b>holder</b> notifies the vendor in accordance with a cancellation procedure in the [...] "membership agreement" [...] which the <b>card</b> <b>holder</b> agreed to when they made the initial purchase. Because the periodic charges are unexpected, infrequent, and small, most <b>card</b> <b>holders</b> will not notice the charges. If a <b>card</b> <b>holder</b> complains to the bank that the charges were unauthorized, the bank will notify the vendor of the disputed charges and the vendor will respond that the <b>card</b> <b>holder</b> never cancelled the [...] "membership" [...] which the <b>card</b> <b>holder</b> agreed to. Since most <b>card</b> <b>holders</b> {{have no idea what}} the cancellation procedure is and the vendor will reveal it only to new customers, the bank will not reverse the charges, but instead will offer to cancel the credit card and reissue it with a different account number or expiration date. Unexpected repeat billing is in a gray area of the law, depending on whether the customer legitimately agreed to the charges.|$|R
5000|$|At the {{warehouse}} the team {{finds out that}} the next <b>card</b> <b>holder</b> is in Las Vegas, Nevada. Lincoln, Sucre, Roland, and Sara proceed to Las Vegas. The foursome tails the <b>card</b> <b>holder</b> in a casino to copy his card. Meanwhile, Sara becomes shaken when she learns from Lincoln that Michael may have a brain aneurysm and could die soon like his mother did. Roland's device fails to pick up any signal, and Lincoln deduces that the <b>card</b> <b>holder</b> is keeping his card in his room. At an outdoor swimming pool, Sara is wearing a string bikini with a transparent dress over it and is sent to hit up the <b>card</b> <b>holder</b> by faking {{that she was on}} a stagette party and her friends dared her to get a photo in a whale room. However, the <b>card</b> <b>holder</b> refuses and leaves. The bartender tells her that she [...] "isn't his type" [...] and that the <b>card</b> <b>holder</b> asked if he [...] "liked to party." [...] This leads to the team using Sucre instead, who accepts very reluctantly.|$|R
5000|$|Also, during Access Card creation, {{the game}} will ask the player to create a user name and password. This will be {{registered}} on the Internet and allows an Access <b>Card</b> <b>holder</b> {{to gain access to}} the Project DIVA Arcade Diva.Net. Here, an Access <b>Card</b> <b>holder</b> can edit data and perform many and more of the functions that a Project DIVA Arcade machine can do. However, an Access <b>Card</b> <b>holder</b> must first accumulate 10 non-consecutive plays on any Project DIVA Arcade machine with an Internet connection before they can use many of Diva.Net's functions. Once 10 plays are accumulated, the Access <b>Card</b> <b>holder</b> will gain 30-day access to all of Diva.Net's functions. Access to Diva.Net can only be performed this way, and one gains another 30 days of access every 10 plays. This [...] "access" [...] is known as a Diva.Net Right. Upon first play, a <b>Card</b> <b>holder</b> can automatically obtain a Diva.Net Right once. Losing one's Right does not affect the data, but the <b>Card</b> <b>holder</b> is unable to change it through Diva.Net until another Right is obtained.|$|R
40|$|A {{credit card}} {{is one of}} the {{facilities}} for facilitating buying and selling transaction which involves a bank or a company as the publisher, credit <b>card</b> <b>holders,</b> and sellers. In practice, however, the use of credit cards is determined by the good faith of the parties concerned in taking their responsibilities since it is not possible that there is a default in the contract conducted especially by the credit <b>card</b> <b>holders.</b> The aim of the research was to explain the purchase agreement by using credit cards, the implementation of good faith principle by the credit <b>card</b> <b>holders</b> related to the purchase agreement, and the legal consequences of using credit cards when there is a default by the credit <b>card</b> <b>holders.</b> The research used descriptive analytic method and judicial normative approach which described and analyzed the implementation of good faith principle of credit <b>card</b> <b>holders</b> related to purchase agreement...|$|R

50|$|Normally a <b>probe</b> <b>card</b> is {{inserted}} into an equipment called a wafer prober, inside which {{position of the}} wafer to be tested will be manipulated so {{that there should be}} a precise contact between the <b>probe</b> <b>card</b> and wafer. Once the <b>probe</b> <b>card</b> and the wafer is loaded, a camera in the prober will optically locate several tips on the <b>probe</b> <b>card</b> and several marks or pads on the wafer, and using this information it can align the pads on the device under test (DUT) to the <b>probe</b> <b>card</b> contacts.|$|R

5000|$|People {{who once}} had U.S. {{permanent}} residence status ("green card holders") may also face similar tax issues as accidental citizens, combined with similar unawareness of their status. Green <b>card</b> <b>holders</b> generally {{have the same}} U.S. tax filing obligations as U.S. citizens, regardless of their actual residence. Many green <b>card</b> <b>holders</b> later emigrated from the U.S. and let their green cards expire, believing that since {{they were no longer}} entitled under immigration law to live in the U.S., they also correspondingly had no further tax obligations. However, [...] provides that a green <b>card</b> <b>holder's</b> tax obligations do not end until a formal administrative or judicial determination of abandonment of U.S. residence; this generally requires the green <b>card</b> <b>holder</b> not just {{to move out of the}} United States, but to file Form I-407 with United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. About eighteen thousand people per year file this form, but it is likely that many more green <b>card</b> <b>holders</b> moving out of the U.S. are unaware that this procedure is required.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{attempts to}} contribute to the advancement of knowledge within the services marketing and consumer behaviour domain. Its main aim is to enhance our understanding of the relationship between attitude and behaviour within a financial services setting. The Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) by Fishbein and Ajzen (1967, 1973, 1975) was employed as the theoretical basis of the research. Following an extensive literature review, we identified five constructs and credit card specific items. used to develop a Credit <b>card</b> <b>holder</b> Attitude-Behaviour (CABM) model. All the constructs (with the exception of credit <b>card</b> <b>holder</b> behaviour) were measured using multiple items. The survey method was employed via a self-administered postal questionnaire. The data collection instrument was submitted to a sample of 2000 randomly selected UK credit <b>card</b> <b>holders.</b> Statistical properties of the constructs were analysed using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis techniques. The proposed research model was tested with PLS in structural equation modeling technique. The results of the study provided limited support for the central hypothesis of a significant relationship between attitude and behaviour. Two unexpected findings included the significant relationship between <b>card</b> <b>holder</b> behaviour and experience outcome, and also substantial support for the relationship between attitude towards future real income and attitude towards credit <b>cards.</b> Credit <b>card</b> <b>holders</b> exhibit two typical behaviours and future research is needed to examine the attitude-behaviour relationship of convenience users (non-interest paying) and revolving (interest-paying) credit <b>card</b> <b>holders</b> separately. Also recommended, is the examination of the <b>card</b> <b>holder</b> behaviour under observable variables as well as latent variables. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
