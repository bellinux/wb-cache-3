40|$|Current {{trends in}} design of <b>pump-turbines</b> have led into higher rotor-stator {{interaction}} (RSI) loads over impeller-runner. These dynamic loads are {{of special interest}} having produced catastrophic failures in <b>pump-turbines.</b> Determining RSI characteristics facilitates the proposal of actions that will prevent these failures. Pressure measurements all {{around the perimeter of}} the impeller-runner are appropriate to monitor and detect RSI characteristics. Unfortunately most installed <b>pump-turbines</b> are not manufactured with in-built pressure sensors in appropriate positions to monitor RSI. For this reason, vibration measurements are the preferred method to monitor RSI in industry. Usually vibrations are measured in two perpendicular radial directions in bearings where valuable information could be lost due to bearing response. In this work, in order to avoid the effect of bearing response on measurement, two vibration sensors are installed rotating with the shaft. The RSI characteristics obtained with pressure measurements were compared to those determined using vibration measurements. The RSI characteristics obtained with pressure measurements were also determined using vibrations measured rotating with shaft. These RSI characteristics were not possible to be determined using the vibrations measured in guide bearing.

A <b>pump-turbine</b> impeller is a complex structure attached to a rotor and rotating inside a casing full of water with very small clearances between the rotating and the stationary parts. The dynamic response {{of this type of}} structures is very complex and it is very much affected by the connection to the rotor {{as well as by the}} added mass and boundary conditions. As a consequence its calculation presents several uncertainties.; First, the dynamic response of <b>pump-turbine</b> impellers is introduced. Second an experimental investigation in a real impeller attached to the rotor and inside the machine was carried out. For this investigation, the impeller of an existing <b>pump-turbine</b> unit with an installed power of 110 MW and a diameter of 2. 87 m was studied. For a better analysis of the experimental results a numerical model using FEM was also built-up. Frequencies and mode-shapes were identified numerically and experimentally and the characteristics of the structural response analyzed.; To determine the influence of the rotor and supporting structures on the impeller response the results were compared with the ones obtained with the same impeller but suspended (non-connected to the rotor). Experimental and numerical simulation were also used for this case. The changes in the dynamic response due to the rotor connection were determined.; Finally the results obtained are compared with the results from other <b>pump-turbine</b> impellers of different designs and general conclusions about the dynamics of this type of structures are given.

40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} share of new renewable energies like wind and solar in the generation of electricity the need for power regulation and energy storage is becoming of paramount importance. One of the systems to store huge amounts of energy is pumped storage using reversible hydropower units. The machines used in these power plants are <b>pump-turbines,</b> which can operate as a pump and as a turbine. The surplus of electrical energy during low consumption hours can be converted into potential hydraulic energy by pumping water to a higher level. The stored energy can be converted into electricity again by operating the runner as a turbine. Due to new regulation requirements machines have to extend the operating range in order to match energy generation with consumption for the grid stability. In this paper the consequences of extending the operating range in existing <b>pump-turbines</b> have been studied. For that purpose, the data obtained {{after two years of}} condition monitoring were analyzed. Vibrations and pressure fluctuations of two <b>pump-turbines</b> of 85 MW each have been studied during pump and turbine operation.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{hydraulic}} transient analysis of hydro-power plants with particular emphasis {{being placed on}} the turbine and <b>pump-turbine</b> boundary conditions. A lack of suitable data, {{in the form of}} the machine performance characteristics, during the early stages of a hydro-power station's development led to the investigation of alternative sources of performance characteristics, not based on the testing of a hydraulically similar model turbine. Two methods of obtaining turbine performance characteristics were developed, one based on the published performance characteristics of typical reaction turbines and the second based on performance characteristics from a turbine of similar specific speed. The problems particular to the unit parameter representation of four quadrant reversible <b>pump-turbine</b> performance characteristics for use in hydraulic transient analyses were investigated.

40|$|Abstract: As a {{renewable}} energy resource, the {{pumped storage power station}} has great prospects for better balancing supply and demand, particularly with {{further development of}} intermittent power sources and the growing need for an intelligent electric grid. However, pump-turbines often involve problematic S-shaped regions in their machine characteristics and thus, while pumped storage may solve some problems in the grid, <b>pump-turbine</b> operation and control can lead to other problems including severe self-excited oscillation in the hydro-mechanical system. These operational challenges have been so severe that they have even led to some reported accidents. Based on two typical and complex water conveyance systems, includ-ing two <b>pump-turbine</b> system sharing a common tail tunnel and two <b>pump-turbine</b> systems sharing an upstream penstock, the mathematical equations for self-excited oscillation are deduced from the basic equations of pressurized pipe flow coupled to the pump-turbine’s characteristics; moreover, the behaviour of a single <b>pump-turbine</b> system is obtained through simplification of the first analysis. An analytical study is performed and the amplitude–frequency characteristic is investigated by means of both non-linear vibration theory and its corresponding analytical solution algorithm through a multi-scale method. With a given case study in detail, the results show that, for the turbines staying in the S-shaped regions for a relatively long time, self-excited oscillation inevitably occurs with severe oscillation superposed by several oscillation modes by the use of power spectral analysis module in MATLAB, and numerical results are shown to agree well with the theoretical analysis...|$|E
