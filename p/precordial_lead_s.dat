40|$|AbstractIntroductionArrhythmogenic right {{ventricular}} cardiomyopathy/dysplasia (ARVC/D) is {{a genetic}} cardiomyopathy that most commonly affects young adults. The most commonly observed reason {{of death in}} patients suffering from ARVC/D is sudden cardiac death (SCD). On the other hand, idiopathic right ventricular outflow tract tachycardia (RVOT VT) usually has a benign course. Both of the entities may have ventricular tachycardia (VT) with left bundle branch block (LBBB) pattern and inferior axis. We tried to propose new discriminating electrocardiographic indices for differentiation of foretold entities. Material and methodThis was a retrospective study. We reviewed records of patients admitted between 2003 and 2012 with the diagnosis of either ARVC/D or RVOT VT that presented with VT (LBBB morphology). ResultA total of fifty nine patients (30 RVOT VT and 29 ARVC/D) were enrolled. In ARVC/D group, men were dominant while the reverse was true of RVOT VT. Palpitation was {{more common in the}} RVOT VT group (90 % vs. 66. 7 %), but aborted SCD and sustained VT were more common in ARVC/D group. The new ECG criteria proposed by us mean QRS duration in V 1 –V 3, QRS difference in right and left <b>precordial</b> <b>leads,</b> <b>S</b> wave upstroke duration, JT interval dispersion, QRS and JT interval of right to left <b>precordial</b> <b>leads</b> were all significantly longer in ARVC/D when compared to RVOT VT patients (p <  0. 001). ConclusionThe proposed ECG criteria can be used for non-invasive diagnosis of ARVC/D and incorporation in the future updates of ARVC/D task force criteria...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the electrocardiographic (ECG) {{diagnosis}} of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), we evaluated novel quantitative parameters of the QRS complex {{and the value of}} bipolar chest leads (CF leads) computed from the standard 12 leads. We analysed digital 12 -lead ECGs in 44 patients with ARVC, 276 healthy subjects including 44 age and sex-matched with the patients and 36 genotyped members of ARVC families. The length and area of the terminal S wave in V 1 to V 3 were measured automatically using a common for all 12 leads QRS end. T wave negativity was assessed in V 1 to V 6 and in the bipolar CF leads computed from the standard 12 leads. The length and area of the terminal S wave were significantly shorter, whereas the S wave duration was significantly longer in ARVC patients compared with matched controls. Among members of ARVC families, those with mutations (n = 15) had shorter QRS length in V 2 and V 3 and smaller QRS area in lead V 2 compared with those without mutations (n = 20).

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} whether the occurrence of the Brugada Syndrome typical electrocardiogram (ECG) pattern (i. e., right bundle branch block, coved-type ST-segment elevation, and T-wave inversion in the right <b>precordial</b> <b>leads)</b> is characterized by a concomitant lengthening of QT intervals in the right <b>precordial</b> <b>leads.</b> BackgroundIt has been suggested that the typical ECG pattern of Brugada syndrome is due to a decreased net inward current during phase 1 of the action potential, which also leads to its prolongation in the right epicardium. MethodsThirty-two subjects (19 males) age 37 ± 15 years with a suspicious baseline ECG, or who were relatives of Brugada syndrome patients, underwent 12 -lead ECG before and after the administration of flecainide. ResultsThe flecainide test was negative in 14 and positive in 18 subjects. After flecainide administration, the positive ECGs were characterized by a greater QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) prolongation in the right <b>precordial</b> <b>leads</b> than that in the negative ECGs (78. 2 ± 35. 5 ms vs. 22. 0 ± 28. 4 ms in V 1 and 107. 1 ± 43. 8 ms vs. 26. 7 ± 30. 1 ms in V 2; p < 0. 01), whereas there was no difference in the QTc prolongation in the left <b>precordial</b> <b>leads</b> (55. 2 ± 25. 3 ms vs. 35. 1 ± 28. 1 ms in V 5 and 53. 1 ± 32. 8 ms vs. 27. 3 ± 22. 4 ms in V 6; p = NS).

40|$|In this {{exploration}} into electrocardiogram (ECG) lead reconstruction, two algorithms were developed and tested {{on a public}} database and in real-time on patients. These algorithms were based on independent component analysis (ICA). ICA was a promising method due to its implications for spatial independence of lead placement and its adaptive nature to changing orientation of the heart {{in relation to the}} electrodes. The first algorithm was used to reconstruct missing <b>precordial</b> <b>leads,</b> which has two key applications. The first is correcting <b>precordial</b> <b>lead</b> measurements in a standard 12 -lead configuration. If an irregular signal or high level of noise is detected on a <b>precordial</b> <b>lead,</b> the obfuscated signal can be calculated from other nearby leads. The second is the {{reduction in the number of}} <b>precordial</b> <b>leads</b> required for accurate measurement, which opens up the surface of the chest above the heart for diagnostic procedures. Using only two <b>precordial</b> <b>leads,</b> the other four were reconstructed with a high degree of accuracy. This research was presented at the 33 rd International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society in 2011. 1 The second algorithm was developed to construct a full 12 -lead clinical ECG from either three differential measurements or three standard leads. By utilizing differential measurements, the ECG could be reconstructed using wireless systems, which lack the common ground necessary for the standard measurement method. Using three leads distributed across the expanse of the space of the heart, all twelve leads were successfully reconstructed and compared against state of the art algorithms. This work has been accepted for publication in the IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics. 2 These algorithms show a proof of concept, one which can be further honed to deal with the issues of sorting independent components and improving the training sequences. This research also revealed the possibility of extracting and monitoring additional physiological information, such as a patient 2 ̆ 7 s breathing rate from currently utilized ECG systems...|$|R
40|$|Introduction There is {{concordant}} {{opinion that}} upward displacement of V 1, V 2, and V 3 leads increases {{the number of}} ECGs that are diagnostic for the Brugada Syndrome (BS). There are no data that prove whether this manoeuvre increases {{the sensitivity of the}} diagnosis without affecting its specificity. Methods and Results After the clinical diagnosis of BS had been established in a 35 years old male with identification of an SCN 5 A mutation, 59 family members were clinically and genetically evaluated and ECG recordings were performed with upward displacement of <b>precordial</b> <b>leads.</b> Conventional lead position confirmed BS diagnostic (type 1 Brugada ECG) in 2 patients (sensitivity 8, 3 % and specificity 88, 6 %). Positioning of the right <b>precordial</b> <b>leads</b> in the 2 nd intercostal space augmented the sensitivity to 45, 8 % (p= 0, 002), with an inferior specificity (85, 7 %) (p= 0, 5). In the 1 st intercostal space, the sensitivity increased to 54, 2 % (p= 0, 0005) with the smallest specificity (82, 9 %, p= 0, 25). Conclusion We concluded, with statistic significance, that modified upward positioning of right <b>precordial</b> <b>leads</b> augments ECG sensibility in BS diagnostic.

40|$|The {{profound}} {{effects that}} {{rotation of the}} heart, particularly about the longitudinal axis, have on the mean electrical axis, as seen in limb leads, are emphasized, {{and some of the}} experimental and clinical studies that bear on this matter are discussed. The advantages that spatial vectorcardiograms may have in the evaluation of electrocardiographic changes due solely to an unusual position of the heart are pointed out, but, for a number of practical reasons, it is felt that such records will not be very useful in the solution of these or similar problems in the near future. Peculiarities in the form of tracings from the precordium due entirely to an unusual position of the heart are mentioned, but it is considered unwise (except for purposes of investigation) to recommend a change from the conventional sites for multiple <b>precordial</b> <b>leads</b> because of the suspicion that the heart may be placed in an unusual fashion. The suggestion of Kossmann and co-workers that signs suggesting right ventricular enlargement in both standard and <b>precordial</b> <b>leads</b> may arise as a result of marked clockwise rotation of the heart about the long axis is discussed, and some evidence for and against this view is presented. Since concepts basic in the interpretation of <b>precordial</b> <b>leads</b> are involved in this problem, the need for further studies to decide the matter is emphasized. It is pointed out that tangential rather than purely radial spread of the activation wave over the ventricles may explain some of the difficulties encountered in interpretation of <b>precordial</b> <b>leads,</b> particularly when right ventricular enlargement or left bundle branch block is present...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{cardiac rhythm}} {{depends on the}} source and mode of spread of the {{generated}} impulse. ST-T segment represents the repolarization phase of the action potential. Racial variability {{has been established in}} the morphology of the ST segment among the adult population and four waveforms has been described among Nigerian adults which are different from that of Caucasian adults; therefore, there may be differences among the pediatric population. Materials and Methods: This study was a further review of the electrocardiograph (ECG) of 650 apparently healthy primary school children aged 5 - 15 years, in Kano metropolis. Twelve-lead ECG was recorded, and interpretation was manually done. The subjects were categorized into three age groups namely 5 - 7, 8 - 11, and 12 - 15 years, respectively. The ST segment morphology was classified using Araoye′s criteria. Results: Early repolarization changes were recorded in the 12 - 15 years age-group. The presence of ECG variants such as T-wave inversion in <b>precordial</b> <b>leads</b> V 1 -V 3 was reported and left axis deviation was documented in 0. 4 % of the 5 - 7 years age-group. Type I morphology was common in leads I, II, aVF, V 5, V 6. Type II morphology was common in leads I, II, V 4 R, V 5, V 6, while Type III morphology was common in leads V 4 R, V 5, V 6 but Type IV morphology was seen mostly in V 1.

Methods. The presence of complete or incomplete RBBB, S waves in aVL <b>lead,</b> <b>S</b> 1 Q 3 T 3 sign and negative T-waves in the <b>precordial</b> <b>leads</b> were determined at admission ECG in 130 consecutive patients admitted to the intensive care unit of a single tertiary medical center in a 5 -year period. Echocardiography examination with measurement of RVDD and RVSP, multidetector computed tomography pulmonary angiography (MDCT-PA) with the calculation of EBS and SI was determined during the admission process. Multivariable regression models were calculated with ECG parameters as independent variables and the mentioned ultrasound, MDCT-PA parameters and SI as dependent variables. Results. The presence of S-waves in the aVL was the only independent predictor of RVDD (F = 39. 430, p < 0. 001; adjusted R 2 = 0. 231) and systolic peak right ventricle pressure (F = 29. 903, p < 0. 001; adjusted R 2 = 0. 185).
