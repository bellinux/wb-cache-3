40|$|The {{malformation}} of {{sheet metal}} <b>tapping</b> <b>screw</b> threads in the screw threading process increases {{the cost of}} screw threading dies and their maintenance. Die factories do not reveal their screw threading die design techniques, so production and maintenance processes are established by trial-and-error or worker experience and passing down such techniques and documenting quality control is difficult. In this study, screw thread forming design and process analysis were carried out by combining computer-aided design software with computer-aided metal forming analysis software. Simulation results were verified in an actual forming process. The sheet metal <b>tapping</b> <b>screw</b> forging size error was less than 0. 90 %, except at a sharp angle, which was associated with an error of 3. 075 %, thereby demonstrating {{the accuracy of the}} simulated forming process. The numerical analysis process can be utilized to shorten forming development time; {{to reduce the number of}} die tests, and to improve product quality and die service life, reducing the cost of development and promoting the overall competitiveness of the company...|$|R

This study is the initial step {{in the development of}} a basic skills simulator for surgical residents, intended to serve as a cross-platform objective motor skills training system. A robust system was developed to measure motor skills of orthopaedic surgeons and gynecologic surgeons. The orthopaedic study focused on three basic skills: drill, <b>tap,</b> and <b>screw</b> insertion. Each of the participants repeated the sequential task of drill, <b>tap,</b> <b>screw</b> insertion ten times in cadaveric femoral diaphyseal bone. The gynecologic study focused on placement of sutures across ten incisions in synthetic skin. Real time wrist, hand, and finger position was recorded bilaterally using Immersion CyberGloves® and the Ascension Liberty Tracker®. Four metrics were evaluated: task duration, gesture proficiency, hand movement smoothness (replaced by subjective rating in Gyn study), and number of errors, in order to differentiate between groups with different skill levels: No Skills, Limited Skills, Advanced Skills, and Expert Skills. The results demonstrated a significant difference between the Expert Skills group and the less skilled groups. In both studies the Expert Skills group completed the tasks the fastest, with the greatest proficiency, smoothness and accuracy. These results establish the 5 capability of our present skill quantification system and will assist in future improvement of the analysis algorithm...|$|R

40|$|This is {{an article}} from the journal, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part H: Journal of Engineering in Medicine [© IMechE]. It is also {{available}} at: [URL] use of power screwdrivers and drills for <b>tapping</b> and <b>screw</b> insertion in surgery is becoming more common. It has been established from clinical observations {{that the use of}} a small air drill for inserting self-tapping screws provides improved coaxial alignment and precision, and that the drill should be stopped before the screw head is completely seated on the plate, presumably {{to reduce the risk of}} over-tightening. The risk of overrun and over-tightening during <b>tapping</b> and <b>screw</b> insertion is increased with the use of power tools. Prevention of over-tightening is dependent upon when the surgeon detects the onset of tightening, both visually and from the feel of the rapid increase in torque. If detection is too late, then over-tightening or stripping can occur. This study is concerned with using a mechatronic screwdriver to control the tapping depth and to prevent the over-tightening of screws. The effects of various parameters upon the torque profile during <b>tapping</b> and <b>screw</b> insertion have been investigated in synthetic bone and sheep tibia. An automated system is proposed for preventing over-tightening of pre-tapped and self-tapping screws when attaching a surgical plate to a sheep tibia in vitro. The system was used to attach a plate to a sheep tibia using self-tapping screws. The mean torque of the screws inserted using the automated system was 35 per cent of the stripping torque...|$|R
