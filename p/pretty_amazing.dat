In 2011, she appeared nude in The Body Issue of ESPN The Magazine. Of the experience, she said, [...] "I'm an athlete—that's all I am. If a sex symbol is now a top female athlete, I think that's <b>pretty</b> <b>amazing</b> and it shows how far our country has come from the stick-thin models, from what you see in most magazines." ...|$|E

"Battle of the Bastards" [...] {{was also}} the last episode for {{recurring}} character Rickon Stark (Art Parkinson), who had appeared since the series premiere episode [...] "Winter Is Coming". In an IGN interview, Parkinson {{said that he was}} tipped off about his character's death: [...] "Whenever I was told that I was coming back for Season 6, before they sent me through the scripts and stuff, they sent me through a ring just to say, 'Listen, so that you don't get a shock whenever you read the scripts, just know that you die this season. He continued, [...] "Whenever I came back, I was excited to come back, and the scenes all seemed <b>pretty</b> <b>amazing.</b> I was so happy to re-embrace the character."

500|$|James Montgomery of MTV {{stated that}} the video manages to combine {{elements}} from her previous music videos, such as the style of [...] "Everytime" [...] and the attitude of [...] "Stronger". He also {{referred to it as}} [...] "a <b>pretty</b> <b>amazing</b> amalgamation of all things Brit, and a nice primer of her entire career up to this point". Rolling Stone writer Daniel Kreps compared the party in the video to the 1999 film Eyes Wide Shut and added that [...] "this may be the first Spears video ever crafted strictly with the morally-lax Internet in mind, a brazen clip that doesn't have to tone down its explicit nature lyrically and visually in order to get airplay". Chris Johnson of the Daily Mail compared Spears' housewife style to one of her looks in a 2001 Pepsi commercial. Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly said, [...] "it's kind of difficult to believe the song's real meaning will get past even the thickest listener, the video itself is pretty tame...almost disappointingly so". The reviewer also compared the hairstyle of Spears during the housewife scenes to Marilyn Monroe.|$|E
500|$|Beth Hardie for the Daily Mirror {{wrote that}} the remix came as a shock, because of how Brown [...] "beat her {{virtually}} senseless in a car three years ago just before the Grammys," [...] and noted that Rihanna would face harsh criticism from journalists and fans alike for not setting a good example to younger girls. Hardie continued to state that although the collaboration came as a surprise, [...] "We have to admit, it’s a <b>pretty</b> <b>amazing</b> stroke of genius in terms of publicity and messing with people’s minds." [...] Regarding the collaboration on the remix Jo Usmar from Daily Mirror compared the collaboration to the physical altercation between Rihanna and Brown at the 2009 Grammy Awards, writing [...] "In case you've {{been living in a}} cave {{for the last two years}} this is extraordinarily controversial as Brown was convicted of assaulting Rihanna in 2009 and there was a restraining order issued against him." [...] Ben Rayner for the Toronto Sun was complimentary of the remix, writing that it was an improvement upon the original interlude, [...] "What was empty, unfinished titillation before, then, has become empty, overstated, boardroom-written pseudo-pornography for the pop charts." ...|$|E

[...] He was raised to follow role players like Mario Tremblay, Guy Carbonneau and Bob Gainey rather than stars such as Guy Lafleur or Wayne Gretzky. [...] Bégin has played the majority of his career as a grinder, willing to play a physical game. His style often results in bruises and injuries, a part of the game he relishes. [...] Speaking of his comeback with the Flames in 2013, he noted: [...] "What I missed the most was the pain of playing hockey. The pain from blocking shots, getting hit, hitting people... I missed it a lot." [...] That attitude impressed his coaches; Bob Hartley argued that players like Bégin are a valuable commodity: [...] "Players with the commitment of Steve Begin, I really believe that there’s not enough (of them) in the NHL. [...] I always admired the way that he played. I look at the spirit, the leadership. <b>Pretty</b> <b>amazing</b> what he’s done for us." ...|$|E

[...] Lynch recorded her scenes together with cast member Dan Castellaneta, who voices Homer.

[...] Lynch added that she [...] "had the best time. I would do it again and again. This is kind of very much a milestone in my career. I will point to this as a big deal." [...] In an interview with Fox All Access, Lynch revealed that she is a longtime fan: [...] "Indeed I am a fan of The Simpsons. I started watching twenty years ago. I remember the first season.

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} many positive reviews from fans and television critics. One-time The Simpsons writer and comedian Ricky Gervais named it his second favorite episode, and said: [...] "Mr. Burns gives [...] this terrible plaque above his desk that says, 'Don't forget: You're here forever.' It's about how sometimes things don't {{go the way}} you planned, which is <b>pretty</b> <b>amazing</b> in a cartoon. Homer then puts up all the pictures of Maggie he's ever taken to strategically cover this horrible thing so it now reads, 'Do it for her.' It gives me a lump in the throat thinking about it." [...] Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{the authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, said: [...] "A surprisingly traditional episode. The flashback to 1993 seems a bit odd, but this {{is a good example of}} a story that doesn't overly rely on set pieces and confounded expectations for its success." [...] In a review of the sixth season, Joshua Klein of the Chicago Tribune cited [...] "And Maggie Makes Three", [...] "Treehouse of Horror V", [...] "Homer Badman", and [...] "Lisa's Rival" [...] among his favorite episodes of the season.|$|E
500|$|Pamela and Bobby's {{relationship}} {{changed significantly}} {{as the show}} went on and began to progress. In order to create conflict, the producers brought in actors Priscilla Presley (Jenna Wade) and John Beck (Mark Graison) to cause drama for the couple. Eventually, the two characters divorced one another and went their separate ways. After becoming involved with Ewing oil, Bobby tended to put Pam on the backburner with the company coming first. In an interview with People, Principal said: [...] "I wouldn't {{put up with the}} way Pam is treated by Bobby." [...] She also added, [...] "Our marriage just doesn't work anymore and I want a divorce." [...] With the impending couple doomed, Pamela began a newfound relationship with Mark Graison (played by John Beck). The producers of Dallas were faced with the obstacle of getting the audience to root for a new love interest in Pam's life. When asked about the reception of his characters relationship with Pamela, Beck commented: [...] "It was always set up that way from the beginning, so it was quite a task and of course they came back together in the long run. I was just hoping for the best. I never got an extraordinary reaction from the public but it was everywhere, so constant recognition. It was <b>pretty</b> <b>amazing</b> but I never saw it the way he sees it but I can see his point of view. I never really looked at it like that." ...|$|E

[...] The New York Times noted [...] "fter her right breast upstaged the Super Bowl, she was criticized by the first lady, vilified by media executives and abandoned by her co-conspirator, Justin Timberlake; less excitable commentators suggested she was merely a shrewd publicity-stunt woman with a new album to promote." [...] Jackson's parents, Joe and Katherine Jackson, also expressed concern that Timberlake did not stand by Janet following the incident, commenting, [...] "What I didn't like is there wasn't one person on that stage, there were two people. After a while, there was only Janet Jackson. That's all there was. Janet Jackson," [...] adding [...] "Janet don't pull that thing open herself. He did it. We were surprised that they didn't say anything to Justin about it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Arisu Kashiwagi, lead {{designer}} at Imaginary Forces for {{the title}} sequence, was [...] "inspired by all the changing activity and vignettes within those rows of windows [...] — the patterns of light, color, narratives, and graphic silhouettes. It is <b>pretty</b> <b>amazing</b> {{how much you can}} see and the number of windows out there with wide open shades... I could understand our innate fascination with the rear window and that discomforting pleasure when catching a small sliver of a private act." [...] She also looked to Edward Hopper's [...] "Night Windows" [...] and Gerhard Richter's paintings for reference. In order to differentiate the sequence from other painting-inspired ones, Kashiwagi chose to take [...] "a more modern, abstract look while also embracing the spirit of David Mack’s watercolor paintings from" [...] Alias. On the design concept, she added, [...] "We based the concept off of Jessica’s PTSD and alcoholism, her blurry, unreliable point of view, and translated that visually using paint strokes that smear and obfuscate the scenes ... the scenes would appear only in small sections of the frame, either blocked by a foreground element or contained inside of a silhouetted framing device." [...] Michelle Dougherty, creative director on the project, looked to the opening sequence of Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window to help create the [...] "voyeuristic approach" [...] as well as [...] "using the city as a character" [...] to highlight [...] "the dark places [...] the grit" [...] where Jones investigates.|$|E
