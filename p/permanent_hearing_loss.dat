5|$|Although only males {{produce the}} cicadas' {{distinctive}} sound, both sexes have membraneous structures called tympana {{by which they}} detect sounds; the equivalent of having ears. Males disable their own tympana while calling, thereby preventing damage to their hearing; a necessity partly because some cicadas produce sounds up to 120dB (SPL) which is among the loudest of all insect-produced sounds. The song is loud enough to cause <b>permanent</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> in humans should the cicada sing just outside the listener's ear. In contrast, some small species have songs so high in pitch that they are inaudible to humans.|$|E

25|$|According to the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks, {{the risk}} of hearing damage from digital audio players depends on both sound level and {{listening}} time. The listening habits of most users are unlikely to cause hearing loss, but some people are putting their hearing at risk, because they set the volume control very high or listen to music at high levels for many hours per day. Such listening habits may result in temporary or <b>permanent</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> tinnitus, and difficulties understanding speech in noisy environments.|$|E

40|$|<b>Hearing</b> <b>loss</b> is a signifi cant global health-care burden {{because of}} its {{widespread}} prevalence and long-term consequences for affected individuals, communities and society. Recent estimates by the World Health Organization indicate that 360 million persons, comprising 5. 3 % of the global population, suffer from <b>permanent</b> disabling <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> (WHO, 2013 a). More than 32 million of these are children, of whom the vast majority will {{not have access to}} early detection services for their <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> (WHO, 2010, 2013 a). Children with <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> are at risk for delayed speech, language, and cognitive skills, which translates to reduced literacy, academic and socio-emotional development, and higher risks of failure and fall-out in schools (WHO, 2013 a). Unidentifi ed childhood <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> has historically been shown to dramatically deteriorate educa-tional achievement and ultimately vocational outcomes (AAA, 2011; Holden-Pitt & Diaz, 1998).

25|$|Opposition to vaccination, from a {{wide array}} of vaccine critics, has existed since the {{earliest}} vaccination campaigns. Although the benefits of preventing serious illness and death from infectious diseases greatly outweigh the risks of rare serious adverse effects following immunization, disputes have arisen over the morality, ethics, effectiveness, and safety of vaccination. Some vaccination critics say that vaccines are ineffective against disease or that vaccine safety studies are inadequate. Some religious groups do not allow vaccination, and some political groups oppose mandatory vaccination on the grounds of individual liberty. In response, concern has been raised that spreading unfounded information about the medical risks of vaccines increases rates of life-threatening infections, not only in the children whose parents refused vaccinations, but also in those who cannot be vaccinated due to age or immunodeficiency, who could contract infections from unvaccinated carriers (see herd immunity). Some parents believe vaccinations cause autism, although there is no scientific evidence to support this idea. In 2011, Andrew Wakefield, a leading proponent of one of the main controversies regarding a purported link between autism and vaccines, was found to have been financially motivated to falsify research data and was subsequently stripped of his medical license. In the United States people who refuse vaccines for non-medical reasons have made up {{a large percentage of the}} cases of measles, and subsequent cases of <b>permanent</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> and death caused by the disease.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{long-term}} {{risk factor}} from firefighting is exposure {{to high levels}} of sound, which can cause noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and tinnitus. [...] NIHL is caused by exposure to sound levels at or above 85dBA according to NIOSH and at or above 90dBA according to OSHA. dBA represents A-weighted decibels. dBA is used for measuring sound levels relating to occupational sound exposure since it attempts to mimic the sensitivity of the human ear to different frequencies of sound. OSHA uses a 5-dBA exchange rate, which means that for every 5dBA increase in sound from 90dBA, the acceptable exposure time before a risk of <b>permanent</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> occurs decreases by half (starting with 8 hours acceptable exposure time at 90dBA). NIOSH uses a 3-dBA exchange rate starting at 8 hours acceptable exposure time at 85dBA. [...] The time of exposure required to potentially cause damage depends on the level of sound exposed to..The most common causes of excessive sound exposure are sirens, transportation to and from fires, fire alarms, and work tools. Traveling in an emergency vehicle has shown to expose a person to between 103 and 114dBA of sound. According to OSHA, exposure at this level is acceptable for between 17 and 78 minutes and according to NIOSH is acceptable for between 35 seconds and 7.5 minutes [...] over a 24-hour day before <b>permanent</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> can occur. This time period considers that no other high level sound exposure occurs in that 24-hour time frame. Sirens often output about 120dBA, which according to OSHA, 7.5 minutes of exposure is needed and according to NIOSH, 9 seconds of exposure is neededin a 24-hour time period before <b>permanent</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> can occur. In addition to high sound levels, another risk factor for hearing disorders is the co-exposure to chemicals that are ototoxic. [...] The average day of work for a firefighter can often be under the sound exposure limit for both OSHA and NIOSH. The average day of sound exposure as a firefighter is often under the limit, but firefighters can be exposed to impulse noise, which has a very low acceptable time exposure before permanent hearing damage can occur due to the high intensity and short duration.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} {{the nature of}} <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> and associated risk profile in a representative South African population of infants and children diagnosed at a pediatric referral clinic. METHODS: A retrospective review of patient files for a pediatric auditory evoked potential clinic in Pretoria was conducted (January 2007 to December 2011). Collected data included demographical information, risk factors from case history questionnaire, diagnosis (type and degree of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss),</b> documented age of caregiver suspicion and age of first diagnosis. RESULTS: <b>Hearing</b> <b>loss</b> was present in 73 % (73 / 100) of cases evaluated. <b>Permanent</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>losses</b> (SNHL, ANSD & Mixed) constituted 76 % of <b>losses.</b> Unilateral <b>hearing</b> <b>losses</b> constituted 8 % of SNHL and 20 % of conductive <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> ANSD was diagnosed in 21. 4 % and SNHL in 78. 6 % of <b>permanent</b> non-conductive <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> cases. The most prevalent SNHL risk was family history of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> and for ANSD it was admittance to the NICU for more than 5 days. The majority {{of the sample was}} diagnosed with a permanent bilateral SNHL and ANSD after 36 months of age (47 %) despite 40 % already suspected of having a <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> before 12 months of age. CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence of ANSD was found with preventable risk factors often indicated. Age of diagnosis was significantly delayed, evidencing the lack of early hearing detection services in South Africa. The majority of children were diagnosed at ages precluding optimal benefits from early detection and subsequent intervention. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Acoustic {{weapons are}} under {{research}} and development in a few countries. Advertised as one type of non-lethal weapon, {{they are said to}} immediately incapacitate opponents while avoiding permanent physical damage. Reliable information on specifications or effects is scarce, however. The present article sets out to provide basic information in several areas: effects of large-amplitude sound on humans, potential high-power sources, and propagation of strong sound. Concerning the first area, it turns out that infrasound- prominent in journalistic articles- does not have the alleged drastic effects on humans. At audio frequencies, annoyance, discomfort and pain are the consequence of increasing sound pressure lev-els. Temporary worsening of hearing may turn into <b>permanent</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>losses</b> depend-ing on level, frequency, duration etc.; at very high sound levels, even one or a few short exposures can render a person partially or fully deaf. Ear protection, however, can be quite efficient in preventing these effects. Beyond hearing, some disturbance of the equilibrium, and intolerable sensations mainly in the chest can occur. Blast waves from explosions with their much higher overpressure at close range can damage othe...|$|R
