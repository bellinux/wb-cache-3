25|$|<b>Pneumatic</b> <b>tire</b> - Granted U.S. Patent 488,494 on December 20, 1892 (Stillman and Brown).|$|E
25|$|The two-wheeled pedal powered bicycle {{was first}} {{conceived}} in Paris in the 1860s. By 1888 John Dunlop's <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tire</b> and the chain drive {{made possible the}} safety bicycle, giving the bicycle its modern form.|$|E
25|$|In 1888, when John Dunlop re-invented the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tire</b> for his son's tricycle, {{the high}} wheel was made obsolete. The {{comfortable}} ride once found only on tall wheels {{could now be}} enjoyed on smaller chain-driven bicycles. By 1893, high-wheelers were no longer being produced. Use lingered into the 1920s in track cycling until racing safety bicycles were adequately designed.|$|E
30|$|Tires {{carry the}} weight of the entire vehicle and are the only contact media with the ground [1]. However, {{traditional}} <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tires</b> are punctured easily in poor road conditions, which could lead to vehicle failure as well as traffic accidents. In addition, the pressure of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tires</b> must be kept stable at all times, thus increasing the time and maintenance costs [2, 3]. Therefore, various new structure safety tires have been proposed. Non-pneumatic tires are air-proof and maintenance-free compared to conventional <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tires,</b> thus improving vehicle safety while providing good comfort.|$|R
50|$|Walther {{had been}} {{thinking}} about wheel designs for <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tires</b> because the increased speed of commercial vehicles was causing problems with the solid rubber tires. He believed that <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tires</b> were the coming thing. He studied everything that had been done in the development of wheels for <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tires.</b> Among the war equipment exhibited in Washington after World War I was dual pneumatic wheel equipment made by Michelin Tire Company of France. Walther studied these wheels and the ones being made by Firestone in this country. He felt that both could be vastly improved.|$|R

25|$|Further {{innovations}} increased {{comfort and}} {{ushered in a}} second bicycle craze, the 1890s Golden Age of Bicycles. In 1888, Scotsman John Boyd Dunlop introduced the first practical <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tire,</b> which soon became universal. Soon after, the rear freewheel was developed, enabling the rider to coast. This refinement led to the 1890s invention of coaster brakes. Dérailleur gears and hand-operated Bowden cable-pull brakes were also developed during these years, but were only slowly adopted by casual riders.|$|E
25|$|Widely imitated, {{the safety}} bicycle {{completely}} replaced the high-wheeler in North America and Western Europe by 1890. Meanwhile, John Dunlop's reinvention of the pneumatic bicycle tire in 1888 {{had made for}} a much smoother ride on paved streets; the previous type were quite smooth-riding, when used on the dirt roads common at the time. As with the original velocipede, safety bicycles had been much less comfortable than high-wheelers {{precisely because of the}} smaller wheel size, and frames were often buttressed with complicated bicycle suspension spring assemblies. The <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tire</b> made all of these obsolete, and frame designers found a diamond pattern to be the strongest and most efficient design.|$|E
2500|$|Vulcanized rubber {{made the}} <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tire</b> possible, {{which in turn}} enabled the {{development}} of on and off-road vehicles as we know them. [...] Synthetic rubber became important during the Second World War when supplies of natural rubber were cut off.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tire</b> and {{the diamond}} frame {{improved}} rider comfort {{but do not}} form a crucial design or safety feature. A hard rubber tire on a [...] bicycle is just as rideable but is bone jarring. The frame design allows for a lighter weight, and more simple construction and maintenance, hence lower price.|$|E
2500|$|Brown and Stillman {{are best}} known for their {{invention}} of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tire</b> for vehicles, patented on December 20, 1892. The tire was manufactured at the Hartford Rubber Works in Hartford, Connecticut in 1895. In July of that year, auto manufacturer, Charles Duryea used the Brown-Stillman tires on his [...] "motorized wagon" [...] and won the $5,000 first prize in the [...] automobile race which was reported as the first automobile race held in the United States. Duryea [...] "covered the distance in 7 hours, 53 minutes at an average speed of [...]|$|E
2500|$|The Me 261 had a conventional, {{retractable}} tail-wheel landing gear, {{although it}} had unusually large and bulky low-pressure tires, much like modern day aircraft tundra tires, which prevented the aircraft from becoming bogged down on rough grass landing strips. [...] The main gear's design appears to use main struts that rotated through 90° during their rearwards retraction sequence, that had the sizable main wheels resting atop the retracted struts, much like the production examples of the Junkers Ju 88 already used, with even the fully retractable tailgear possessing a larger-than-average, low-pressure <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tire.</b>|$|E

2500|$|An {{explosion}} of new discoveries and inventions took place, {{a process called}} the Second Industrial Revolution. The electric light, telephone, steam turbine, internal combustion engine, automobile, phonograph, typewriter and tabulating machine {{were some of the}} many inventions of the period. New processes for making steel and chemicals such as dyes and explosives were invented. [...] The <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tire,</b> improved ball bearings, machine tools and newly developed metal stamping techniques enabled the large scale production of bicycles in the 1890s. Another significant development was the widespread introduction of electric street railways (trams, trolleys or streetcars) in the 1890s.|$|E
60|$|I {{approached}} my bicycle, earnestly {{hoping that}} the bear had been attempting to ride it, but I found {{that he had been}} trying to do something very different. He had torn the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tire</b> from one of the wheels, and nearly the whole of it was lying scattered about in little bits upon the ground.|$|E
60|$|But Lord Roberts A {{has been}} pretty exhaustively figured and {{described}} in various aeronautical publications. The unforeseen defect was the badness {{of the work in}} the silk netting. It tore aft as soon as I began to contract the balloon, and the last two segments immediately bulged through the hole, exactly as an inner tube will bulge through the ruptured outer cover of a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tire,</b> and then the sharp edge of the torn net cut the oiled-silk of the distended last segment along a weak seam and burst it with a loud report.|$|E

5000|$|The M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System, {{used in the}} USA {{and several}} other countries, uses a tractor crawler drive instead of {{conventional}} <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tires.</b> An example of a single-missile vehicle with a tractor crawler drive is the French Pluton missile launcher, based on the AMX-30 tank. The 2K11 Krug is a Soviet/Russian two-missile transporter erector launcher with a tractor crawler drive. The Russians also have rather extensive S-300 missile systems on various vehicles. Other examples of Soviet MRLs include the BM-21 Grad, BM-27 Uragan, and BM-30 Smerch, which use <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tires</b> and tubular missile canisters and are also used by various other countries. A Soviet-produced 9K52 Luna-M missile system uses a 9P113 single-missile TEL with <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tires</b> to transport an uncovered Soviet 9M21 missile. American missile vehicles include the M1134 Anti-Tank Guided Missile Vehicle from the Stryker family of military vehicles (with <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tires</b> and smaller BGM-71 TOW missiles), MIM-72 Chaparral (with tractor crawler drive and four exposed missiles), and AN/TWQ-1 Avenger (with <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tires</b> and anti-aircraft missile canisters) systems. The Long Range Surveillance and Attack Vehicle produced by Lockheed Martin for the USA is an armored vehicle with four large <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tires</b> on each side (left and right) {{and is able to}} fire missiles from its rotatable turret on top of the vehicle. [...] The initially Soviet then Russian family of S-300 missile systems has been upgraded by the Russian military to the current S-400 Triumf missiles and their carrier vehicles and put into service starting in 2007. The launch tubes with their S-400 missiles inside are transported horizontally (see photo in gallery below), and the battery of launch tubes with missiles are moved into a vertical position for launching with the launch tube bottoms on the ground (see photo of S-400 battery in vertical launch position in gallery below).|$|R
