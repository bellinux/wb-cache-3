50|$|One common {{method for}} {{collecting}} a <b>plankton</b> <b>sample</b> is to tow the net horizontally using a low-speed boat. Before collecting the plankton, the net should be rinsed with the sample water. The user should {{ensure that the}} cod end is completely closed by turning the valve into a vertical position. Then the plankton net is then lowered horizontal to the water surface {{at the side of}} the slowly moving boat. Sampling is done for 1.5 minutes. After this time, the <b>plankton</b> <b>sample</b> is collected in a sample bottle by opening the cod end above it by turning the valve horizontally.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} obtain {{high-quality}} and low-noise images, charge-coupled device (CCD) sensors {{are used in the}} camera system. In the early design system, the CCD cameras were mounted in one of the arm of the platform. The developments in the recent years made the cameras system possible to be mounted in the platform body along with other sensors and flight control. The magnification power on the cameras should be vary, with high magnification power on the camera, we can obtain detail observation result on the <b>plankton</b> <b>sample,</b> such as protozoan that has <1 µm resolution [...] In other hand, the high magnification is able to identify plankton into genus level while low magnification of the camera will provide the rare and larger taxa.|$|E

40|$|Human {{norovirus}} (NoV) {{has been}} studied extensively as an important cause of gastroenteritis outbreaks worldwide. While oysters are a primary vehicle for infection, {{few studies have examined}} the wider distribution of NoV in the estuarine environment. Active shellfish-harvesting areas in Georgia were examined for the prevalence, genotype diversity, and concentrations of NoV in a variety of estuarine sample types over the course of 1 year. Of the 225 samples (9 oyster, 72 water, 72 63 - to 200 -μm plankton, and 72 > 200 -μm plankton) collected from 12 stations across two estuaries, 21 samples (9. 3 %) tested positive for NoV. By sample type, 55. 0 % (5 / 9) of oysters, 8. 3 % (6 / 72) of water samples, 11. 1 % (8 / 72) of 63 - to 200 -μm <b>plankton</b> <b>samples,</b> and 2. 8 % (2 / 72) of > 200 -μm <b>plankton</b> <b>samples</b> were positive for human NoV.

40|$|In 2004 an {{international}} consortium comprising England, Scotland, Netherlands, Germany, Denmark and Norway conducted an ichthyoplankton survey covering {{the whole of}} the North Sea in order to comprehensively survey cod and plaice spawning areas. At each station, ‘cod-like’ eggs were pre-sorted at sea from the <b>plankton</b> <b>sample</b> and preserved in ethanol for subsequent analysis using species-specific genetic probes. The remainder of the <b>plankton</b> <b>sample</b> was fixed in formalin and ichthyoplankton subsequently sorted and identified using traditional visual methods. The results showed stage I plaice spawning to be located in the traditional areas reported from the literature although with evidence of a more northward extension up {{the eastern edge of the}} Dogger Bank compared to data from the 1930 s. The distribution of stage I cod eggs also conformed to historical patterns being most abundant around the southern and eastern edge of the Dogger Bank, in the German Bight, off the Moray Firth and to the east of the Shetland Isles. ‘Cod-like’ eggs were also found in southern Bight but this area was not as well sub-sampled for genetic analyses. Most of the ‘cod-like’ eggs on stations that were sub-sampled adequately in this region were shown to be whiting or other species. Data was also produced on the distribution of haddock eggs which were found over a wider region of the north-western North Sea than shown in historical maps. Whiting eggs were found south of the Dogger Bank and to the east of the Shetland Isles but were absent from the central North Sea. These results are discussed in relation to historical patterns of spawning and recent changes in the abundance of the North Sea plaice, cod and haddock stocks.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop analytical: methods for the determination of trace elements in artificially grown marine <b>plankton</b> <b>samples</b> to provide a knowledge of metal concentrations in marine <b>plankton.</b> <b>Samples</b> were dissolved in a mixture of HF and HNO 3 acids either in teflon beakers on a hot plate or in sealed vessels in a microwave oven. In flame atomic absorption spectrometric determinations (FAAS), it was necessary to complex fluoride with boric acid to prevent the precipitation of lanthanum fluoride. For the determination of calcium in air-acetylene flame, silicon had to be removed by heating to dryness, while for that of strontium the use of nitrous oxide-acetylene flame was essential. ^ Lead was determined by hydride generation FAAS. Plumbane was trapped on the interior of a slotted quartz tube under fuel-lean conditions followed by atomization with the introduction of isobutylmethyl ketone. Although the detection limit was considerably improved, it was not linear with increasing trapping period due to the impurities in the reagents. ^ A method was developed for total elemental characterization of marine <b>plankton</b> <b>samples</b> by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Matrix induced signal suppressions were corrected by internal standardization. The method was applied to the analysis of <b>plankton</b> <b>samples</b> including several whose growth media had been enriched with selenium. The <b>plankton</b> <b>samples</b> were able to tolerate higher mercury concentrations as the selenium concentration increased. ^ The effect of sodium on removal of silicon by heating to dryness was investigated. Evaporation as SiF 4 was unsuccessful in the presence of sodium due the precipitation as sodium fluosilicate. Thus, sodium fluosilicate was first precipitated in acidic solution followed by extractions with mixtures of methanol/nitric acid to recover elements. Fourteen elements were determined accurately by ICP-MS with successful elimination of silicon. ^ A gas chromatographic resin, Chromosorb 102, was investigated for on-line preconcentration of trace elements in seawater for determination by ICP-MS. Preconcentrations were achieved at pH 8. 2 without any chelating agent followed by elution with dilute HNO 3. The resin was capable of retaining 20 elements simultaneously in seawater. No significant degradation was observed in the long-term stability under acid-base treatment. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{new method}} for sensitive, {{specific}} and direct determination of palytoxin is proposed herein. It {{is based on}} combination of reversed phase liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The new method was set up on a turbo ionspray (TSI) -triple quadrupole MS instrument operating in selected ion monitoring (SIM) and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) acquisition modes (positive ions). The minimum detection levels for matrix-free toxin on column were thus estimated from the data to be 200 pg and 125 pg in SIM and MRM mode, respectively. Spiking experiments before and after extraction allowed to assess limits of detection and quantitation for palytoxin in matrix, accuracy, intra-day and inter-day reproducibility of the method.

40|$|In {{the early}} spring of 1997, an {{outbreak}} of paralytic shellfish poisoning due to ingestion of wild oysters occurred at a coast of Tamanoura Bay in Fukue Island, Goto, west Japan. To clarify causative organisms for this incident, dinoflagellate cysts were examined in surface sediments collected from 12 stations of Tamanoura Bay, Kishuku Bay and Togi Bay of Fukue Island. More than 18 genera including 32 species of dinoflagellate cysts were identified and cyst densities in these samples ranged from 442 (GKS-st. 1) - 2070 (GTU-st. 6) cells/ml. A small amount of living cysts of Gymnodinium catenatum, and probable cysts of Alexandrium catenella/tamarense, A. andersonii, and A. minutum were also found.

40|$|Twelve {{species of}} benthic algae from the {{northeast}} coast of the United States, three species of planktonic algae grown in the laboratory, a pelagic alga, a sample of mixed phytoplankton and zooplankton, and a recent marine sediment were analyzed for their normal paraffin distribution from CI,Hm to CXH,,. Normal paraffins occurred in all samples. Benthic and planktonic algae and the mixed <b>plankton</b> <b>sample</b> exhibited only a slight odd-carbon predominance. All algae showed a major maximum at n-C&I = or n-C 1,H 38, a minimum between n-C 1 sH 3 s and &AI-I ~ and a secondary maximum between n-C&Hoe and n-C&~. In all thcsc features, the algae and the plankton differed from recent marine sediments. This suggests that the normal paraffins of recent marine sediments are largely derived from sources other than the organisms studied. Differences in the hydrocarbon distribution patterns of various classes of benthic algae may be of taxonomic value.
