In a population of hospitalized patients, prior antibiotic treatment plus diarrhea or abdominal pain had a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 45%.

25|$|However, it {{has been}} shown that the widely {{accepted}} WHO and American Diabetes Association diagnostic cutoff for diabetes of a fasting plasma glucose ≥ 7.0mmol/l (126mg/dl) does not accurately identify diabetic retinopathy among patients. The cohort study included a multi-ethnic, cross-sectional adult population sample in the US, as well as two cross-sectional adult populations in Australia. For the US-based component of the study, the sensitivity was 34.7% and specificity was 86.6%. For patients at similar risk to those in this study (15.8% had diabetic retinopathy), this leads to a <b>positive</b> <b>predictive</b> <b>value</b> of 32.7% and negative predictive value of 87.6%.|$|E
25|$|One {{can perform}} {{high-throughput}} shotgun sequencing from plasma {{of pregnant women}} to obtain about 5 million sequence tags per patient sample.

Shotgun sequencing can be done with a Solexa/Illumina platform. Whole fetal genome mapping by parental haplotype analysis using sequencing of cell free fetal DNA was done in 2010. Chiu et al. in 2010 studied 753 pregnant females, using a 2-plex massively parallel maternal plasma DNA sequencing and trisomy was diagnosed with z-score greater than 3.

All urine samples also underwent routine microscopy and culture. The sensitivities of the Nephur test and Multistix were 83 % and 82 %, respectively; the specificities were 28 % and 40 %, respectively; the negative <b>predictive</b> <b>values</b> were 85 % and 88 %, respectively; and the <b>positive</b> <b>predictive</b> <b>values</b> were 24 % and 29 %, respectively.

25|$|Aneuploidy, {{which refers}} to {{abnormal}} number of chromosomes, can also be detected using non-invasive prenatal tests. Research previous shown an increase in quantity of cffDNA in maternal plasma for fetal trisomy 13 and trisomy 21, {{and it is not}} elevated in fetal trisomy 18. A number of fetal nucleic acid molecules derived from aneuploid chromosomes can be detected including SERPINEB2 mRNA, clad B, hypomethylated SERPINB5 from chromosome 18, placenta-specific 4 (PLAC4), hypermethylated holocarboxylase synthetase (HLCS) and c21orf105 mRNA from chromosome 12. With complete trisomy, the mRNA alleles in maternal plasma isn't the normal 1:1 ratio, but is in fact 2:1. Allelic ratios determined by epigenetic markers {{can also be used to}} detect the complete trisomies. Massive parallel sequencing and digital PCR for fetal aneuploidy detection can be used without restriction to fetal-specific nucleic acid molecules. Several cell-free fetal DNA and RNA technologies are under development to test a pregnancy for aneuploidy, mostly focusing on Down syndrome testing. Sampling of cffDNA from maternal blood for analysis by massively parallel sequencing (MPSS) is estimated to have a sensitivity of between 96 and 100%, and a specificity between 94 and 100% for detecting Down syndrome. It can be performed at 10 weeks of gestational age. One study in the United States estimated a false positive rate of 0.3% and a <b>positive</b> <b>predictive</b> <b>value</b> of 80% when using cffDNA to detect Down syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Assessing the {{accuracy}} of CT pulmonary angiography is hindered by the rapid changes {{in the number of}} rows of detectors available in multidetector CT (MDCT) machines. According to a cohort study, single-slice spiral CT may help diagnose detection among people with suspected pulmonary embolism. In this study, the sensitivity was 69% and specificity was 84%. In this study which had a prevalence of detection was 32%, the <b>positive</b> <b>predictive</b> <b>value</b> of 67.0% and negative predictive value of 85.2%. However, this study's results may be biased due to possible incorporation bias, since the CT scan was the final diagnostic tool in people with pulmonary embolism. The authors noted that a negative single slice CT scan is insufficient to rule out pulmonary embolism on its own. A separate study with a mixture of 4 slice and 16 slice scanners reported a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 96%, which means that it is a good test for ruling out a pulmonary embolism if it is not seen on imaging and that it is very good at confirming a pulmonary embolism is present if it is seen. This study noted that additional testing is necessary when the clinical probability is inconsistent with the imaging results. CTPA is non-inferior to VQ scanning, and identifies more emboli (without necessarily improving the outcome) compared to VQ scanning.|$|E
500|$|However, not {{all people}} with a falling {{platelet}} count while receiving heparin {{turn out to have}} HIT. The timing, severity of the thrombocytopenia, the occurrence of new thrombosis, and the presence of alternative explanations, all determine the likelihood that HIT is present. A commonly used score to predict the likelihood of HIT is the [...] "4 Ts" [...] score introduced in 2003. A score of 0–8 points is generated; if the score is 0-3, HIT is unlikely. A score of 4–5 indicates intermediate probability, while a score of 6–8 makes it highly likely. Those with a high score may need to be treated with an alternative drug while more sensitive and specific tests for HIT are performed, while those with a low score can safely continue receiving heparin as the likelihood that they have HIT is extremely low. In an analysis of the reliability of the 4T score, a low score had a negative predictive value of 0.998, while an intermediate score had a <b>positive</b> <b>predictive</b> <b>value</b> of 0.14 and a high score a <b>positive</b> <b>predictive</b> <b>value</b> of 0.64; intermediate and high scores therefore warrant further investigation.|$|E

Furthermore, {{the level of the}} D-dimer correlated with the extent of the thrombosis. A subsequent study, however, [...] showed that 10% of patients with confirmed thrombosis had a normal D-dimer, and in those who had presented with only a headache 26% had a normal D-dimer. The study concludes that D-dimer is not useful in the situations where it would make the most difference, namely in lower probability cases.|$|E
