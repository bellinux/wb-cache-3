40|$|Abstract: In the 21 st century, the {{development}} of revolution in the new era emphasizes {{the development}} of universal art, and the cartoon develops rapidly in China, which realizes effective inheritance <b>and</b> development of <b>painting</b> <b>and</b> animation. How to ensure that <b>painting</b> <b>and</b> cartoon has better visual art and appreciation value is one the focuses of the animation industry in China. While researching <b>and</b> analyzing <b>painting</b> <b>and</b> animation, the paper firstly analyzes the principle and main manifestation of animation, <b>and</b> then compares <b>painting</b> <b>and</b> animation. Lastly, the paper expounds the relationship between <b>painting</b> <b>and</b> animation...|$|R

5|$|Drying oils are {{vegetable}} oils that dry to a hard finish at normal room temperature.

5|$|As Griet cleans Vermeer's studio, {{which his}} wife Catharina (Essie Davis) never enters, the painter begins to {{converse}} with her and encourages her appreciation of painting, light and color. Vermeer gives her lessons in mixing <b>paints</b> <b>and</b> other tasks, taking care to keep this secret from his wife, who would react with anger and jealousy if she found out {{that her husband was}} spending time with Griet. In contrast, Vermeer's pragmatic mother-in-law, Maria Thins (Judy Parfitt), sees Griet as useful to Vermeer's career.|$|E

5|$|Cobalt is {{primarily}} {{used in the}} preparation of magnetic, wear-resistant and high-strength alloys. The compounds, cobalt silicate and cobalt(II) aluminate (CoAl2O4, cobalt blue) give a distinctive deep blue color to glass, ceramics, inks, <b>paints</b> <b>and</b> varnishes. Cobalt occurs naturally as only one stable isotope, cobalt-59. Cobalt-60 is a commercially important radioisotope, used as a radioactive tracer and for the production of high energy gamma rays.|$|E
5|$|During the 1800s, {{chromium}} {{was primarily}} {{used as a}} component of <b>paints</b> <b>and</b> in tanning salts. At first, crocoite from Russia was the main source, but in 1827, a larger chromite deposit was discovered near Baltimore, United States. This made the United States the largest producer of chromium products till 1848 when large deposits of chromite were found near Bursa, Turkey.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the major}} dangers to the frescoes is {{automotive}} exhaust, and they are also vulnerable {{to the effects of}} the crowds of tourists that pass through the chapel every day, bringing with them heat, humidity, dust and bacteria (the latter of which can biodegrade <b>paints</b> <b>and</b> pigments). The clean plaster surfaces are more in danger from these destructive elements than they were when they were covered with a layer of smoky wax.|$|E
5|$|Some {{heavy metals}} are either {{essential}} nutrients (typically iron, cobalt, and zinc), or relatively harmless (such as ruthenium, silver, and indium), {{but can be}} toxic in larger amounts or certain forms. Other heavy metals, such as cadmium, mercury, and lead, are highly poisonous. Potential sources of heavy metal poisoning include mining, tailings, industrial wastes, agricultural runoff, occupational exposure, <b>paints</b> <b>and</b> treated timber.|$|E

5|$|Cobalt-based blue {{pigments}} (cobalt blue) {{have been}} used since ancient times for jewelry and <b>paints,</b> <b>and</b> to impart a distinctive blue tint to glass, but the color was later thought by alchemists {{to be due to}} the known metal bismuth. Miners had long used the name kobold ore (German for goblin ore) for some of the blue-pigment producing minerals; they were so named because they were poor in known metals, and gave poisonous arsenic-containing fumes upon smelting. In 1735, such ores were found to be reducible to a new metal (the first discovered since ancient times), and this was ultimately named for the kobold.|$|E
5|$|In the American Azteca registry, horses with American Paint Horse (APHA) {{breeding}} {{are also}} allowed. However, horses {{with more than}} 25 percent Thoroughbred blood in their pedigrees (common in many <b>Paints</b> <b>and</b> Quarter Horses) within four generations cannot be registered. American Aztecas have four categories of registration based on the relative degree of blood from each foundation breed, seeking an ideal blend of 3/8 Quarter Horse and 5/8 Andalusian.

5|$|Meanwhile, Julian {{had written}} to the Glidden Company, a {{supplier}} of soybean oil products, to request a five-gallon sample of the oil to use as his {{starting point for the}} synthesis of human steroidal sex hormones (in part because his wife was suffering from infertility). After receiving the request, W. J. O'Brien, a vice-president at Glidden, made a telephone call to Julian, offering him the position of director of research at Glidden's Soya Products Division in Chicago. He was very likely offered the job by O'Brien because he was fluent in German, and Glidden had just purchased a modern continuous countercurrent solvent extraction plant from Germany for the extraction of vegetable oil from soybeans for <b>paints</b> <b>and</b> other uses.|$|E

5|$|Roughly {{one quarter}} of all zinc output in the United States in 2009 was {{consumed}} in zinc compounds; a variety of which are used industrially. Zinc oxide is widely used as a white pigment in <b>paints</b> <b>and</b> as a catalyst {{in the manufacture of}} rubber to disburse heat. Zinc oxide is used to protect rubber polymers and plastics from ultraviolet radiation (UV). The semiconductor properties of zinc oxide make it useful in varistors and photocopying products. The zinc zinc-oxide cycle is a two step thermochemical process based on zinc and zinc oxide for hydrogen production.|$|E
5|$|The calcium {{carbonate}} or silica spicules of most sponge genera make them too rough for most uses, but two genera, Hippospongia and Spongia, have soft, entirely fibrous skeletons. Early Europeans used soft sponges for many purposes, including padding for helmets, portable drinking utensils and municipal water filters. Until {{the invention of}} synthetic sponges, they were used as cleaning tools, applicators for <b>paints</b> <b>and</b> ceramic glazes and discreet contraceptives. However, by the mid-20th century, over-fishing brought both the animals and the industry close to extinction.|$|E
5|$|The element was {{probably}} {{named by the}} alchemist Paracelsus after the German word Zinke (prong, tooth). German chemist Andreas Sigismund Marggraf is credited with discovering pure metallic zinc in 1746. Work by Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta uncovered the electrochemical properties of zinc by 1800. Corrosion-resistant zinc plating of iron (hot-dip galvanizing) is the major application for zinc. Other applications are in electrical batteries, small non-structural castings, and alloys such as brass. A variety of zinc compounds are commonly used, such as zinc carbonate and zinc gluconate (as dietary supplements), zinc chloride (in deodorants), zinc pyrithione (anti-dandruff shampoos), zinc sulfide (in luminescent <b>paints),</b> <b>and</b> zinc methyl or zinc diethyl in the organic laboratory.|$|E
