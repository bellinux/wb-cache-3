40|$|As {{teachers}} and society become {{more comfortable with}} various technologies, {{it is likely that}} technology will be implemented in all areas of the educational curriculum as well as physical education. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the extent to which individual physical education teachers in public schools were using technology as a tool for their students' education. Individuals who were currently teaching physical education in public schools in Indiana completed the Computer Usage Survey on the web (N = 400). To determine types of technology used, potential uses for technology, difference in the implementation of technology by gender and teaching experience, usage of the Internet, and physical educators' attitudes toward technology, statistics including descriptive statistics, Chi-square (X), and One-way ANOVA were used (p <. 05). The results of this study show that <b>physical</b> <b>educators</b> were more likely to use PC computers (both desktop and laptop) over Apple computers. Participant responses demonstrated a high usage of hardware devices such as Printers, hard drives, and CD drives, however, 5. 25 floppy drives, external hard drives, Hand-held computers (i. e. Pocket PC or Companion PC), Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), and smart boards were rarely used by <b>physical</b> <b>educators.</b> A significant positive relationship resulted between use of technology at school and at home. Significant differences were observed between male and female <b>physical</b> <b>educators</b> in types of technology used and purposes for using technology. Use of technology was significantly lower in the experienced <b>physical</b> <b>educators</b> group. Most of the <b>physical</b> <b>educators</b> use the Internet and they usually use it for research and teaching/assessment ideas. <b>Physical</b> <b>educators</b> in Indiana believed that technology has an important role and can enhance their teaching with implementation of technology.

Pseudonyms protected the names of the participants and institutions. The theoretical framework guiding this study was social cognitive theory. The research questions were (a) How do the attitudes and beliefs of teaching physical education as pre-service <b>physical</b> <b>educators</b> influence their knowledge and skill development for classroom preparedness? (b) What aspects of the teacher education program do pre-service <b>physical</b> <b>educators</b> believe best prepared them for their student teaching experiences to influence student outcomes?

40|$|Effective {{teachers}} must be skilled in {{using a variety of}} assessment techniques. Research has demonstrated that there is a significant gap between assessment theory taught to pre-service <b>physical</b> <b>educators</b> and practice in the physical education setting. One of the most critical skills necessary in successful assessment is the ability to observe. Observational skills in physical education demand movement analysis and subsequent translation of this visual analysis into a series of criteria. The Test of Gross Motor Development II (TGMD II) provides criteria for motor skills taught to children in elementary school (age 3 - 10). In addition to the written criteria, a series of pictures are provided to assist the person performing the assessment. This study sought to determine the effectiveness of <b>physical</b> <b>educators</b> utilizing screencasts of motor skills found in the TGMD II compared to <b>physical</b> <b>educators</b> who studied the images found in the TGMD II manual. The primary issue was whether <b>physical</b> <b>educators</b> who watch screencasts become skilled in observational techniques and thus are able to utilize these skills in the real world when observing children performing the TGMD II. A second question is which method increased pre-service teacher confidence for and interest in evaluation. Data was collected during Fall 2011. The proposal seeks to determine: 1. Assessment skill development of teachers: The effectiveness of screencasts compared to textbook methods to implement motor skill evaluation. 2.

40|$|Background: In {{order to}} design {{appropriate}} environments for performance and learning of movement skills, <b>physical</b> <b>educators</b> need a sound theoretical {{model of the}} learner and of processes of learning. In physical education, this type of modelling informs the organisation of learning environments and effective and efficient use of practice time. An emerging theoretical framework in motor learning, relevant to physical education, advocates a constraints-led perspective for acquisition of movement skills and game play knowledge. This framework shows how <b>physical</b> <b>educators</b> could use task, performer and environmental constraints to channel acquisition of movement skills and decision-making behaviours in learners. From this viewpoint, learners generate specific movement solutions to satisfy the unique combination of constraints imposed on them, a process which can be harnessed during physical education lessons. Aims: In this paper {{the aim is to}} provide an overview of the motor learning approach emanating from the constraints-led perspective, and examine how it can substantiate a platform for a new pedagogical framework in physical education: nonlinear pedagogy. We aim to demonstrate that it is only through theoretically valid and objective empirical work of an applied nature that a conceptually sound nonlinear pedagogy model can continue to evolve and support research in physical education. We present some important implications for designing practices in games lessons, showing how a constraints-led perspective on motor learning could assist <b>physical</b> <b>educators</b> in understanding how to structure learning experiences for learners at different stages, with specific focus on understanding the design of games teaching programmes in physical education, using exemplars from Rugby Union and Cricket. Findings: Research evidence from recent studies examining movement models demonstrates that physical education teachers need a strong understanding of sport performance so that task constraints can be manipulated so that information-movement couplings are maintained in a learning environment that is representative of real performance situations. <b>Physical</b> <b>educators</b> should also understand that movement variability may not necessarily be detrimental to learning and could be an important phenomenon prior to the acquisition of a stable and functional movement pattern. We highlight how the nonlinear pedagogical approach is student-centred and empowers individuals to become active learners via a more hands-off approach to learning. Conclusions: A constraints-based perspective has the potential to provide <b>physical</b> <b>educators</b> with a framework for understanding how performer, task and environmental constraints shape each individual's physical education. Understanding the underlying neurobiological processes present in a constraints-led perspective to skill acquisition and game play can raise awareness of <b>physical</b> <b>educators</b> that teaching is a dynamic 'art' interwoven with the 'science' of motor learning theories. </p...|$|R
