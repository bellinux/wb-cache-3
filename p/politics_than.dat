The 1890s were a tough time for the Romanian economy, and {{a rising tide of}} anti-Semitism made it an even tougher time for the Jews. One quarter of the Jewish population emigrated, with intellectuals particularly likely to leave, and those intellectuals who remained were more interested in <b>politics</b> <b>than</b> in theater: this was a period of social ferment, with Jewish socialists in Iaşi starting Der Veker (The Awakener).|$|E
5|$|Lyrically, All Hope Is Gone {{centers on}} themes such as anger, disaffection, obsession, {{and the music}} industry. The album name also {{features}} a more prominent focus on <b>politics</b> <b>than</b> their previous albums. Slipknot promoted All Hope Is Gone on a world tour and at the Mayhem Festival. Generally well received by critics, the album reached the top position on nine record charts worldwide, including the Billboard 200—the first Slipknot album to do so. It was certified platinum by the RIAA on August 10, 2010 for shipments in excess of 1,000,000 albums in the United States. It is the final studio album released by the band to include two longtime members: bassist and founding member Paul Gray, who {{was found dead in}} an Iowa hotel on May 24, 2010, almost two years after the release of All Hope Is Gone, and drummer Joey Jordison, who departed from the group in December 2013.|$|E

He had considered himself to be Indira's likely successor and, siding with those within his party who aligned themselves against Rajiv Gandhi, Mukherjee was eventually expelled.|$|E
25|$|France, Luxembourg, {{and most}} of the Eastern Bloc along with their {{overseas}} territories opted for SECAM. SECAM was a popular choice in countries with a lot of hilly terrain, and technologically backward countries with a very large installed base of monochrome equipment, since the greater ruggedness of the SECAM signal could cope much better with poorly maintained equipment. However, for many countries the decision was more down to <b>politics</b> <b>than</b> technical merit.|$|E

Then, he went to Najaf in 1957, but soon returned to Mashhad due to his father's unwillingness to let him stay there. In 1958, he settled in Qom where he attended the classes of Seyyed Hossein Borujerdi and Ruhollah Khomeini. Like many other politically active clerics at the time, Khamenei was far more involved with <b>politics</b> <b>than</b> religious scholarship.|$|E

Teachers complained about poor management which was often authoritarian rather than democratic. School director appointments were not seen {{to be based on}} merit and, in some cases, were clearly political.

Of the two main routes, the southeast ridge is technically easier and more frequently used. It was the route used by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953 and the first recognised of 15 routes to the top by 1996. This was, however, a route decision dictated more by <b>politics</b> <b>than</b> by design, as the Chinese border was closed to the western world in the 1950s, after the People's Republic of China invaded Tibet.|$|E

25|$|There was a moral {{elevation}} in Cousin's spiritual philosophy which {{touched the}} hearts of his listeners, {{and seemed to be}} the basis for higher development in national literature and art, and even in <b>politics,</b> <b>than</b> the traditional philosophy of France. His lectures produced more ardent disciples than those of any other contemporary professor of philosophy. Judged on his teaching influence, Cousin occupies a foremost place in the rank of professors of philosophy, who like Jacobi, Schelling and Dugald Stewart have united the gifts of speculative, expository and imaginative power. The taste for philosophy—especially its history—was revived in France to an extent unknown since the 17th century.|$|E

25|$|The LTTE is {{responsible}} for forcibly removing, or ethnic cleansing, of Sinhalese and Muslim inhabitants from areas under its control. The eviction of Muslim residents happened in the north in 1990, and the east in 1992. The expulsion of Muslims {{had more to do}} with disagreements over ethnic identity and <b>politics</b> <b>than</b> with religion as the Sri Lankan Muslims did not support the LTTE or the creation of an independent Tamil state and they do not identify with the ethnic Tamils despite being a Tamil-speaking people. The LTTE also saw Muslims as a threat to 'national security' as they alleged their Muslim cadres had defected from their movement to join the Sri Lankan military and paramilitary forces who were allegedly responsible for attacks on Tamil civilians.|$|E

25|$|To the Gaelic-speaking Scottish Highland clans, to {{whom the}} {{supporters}} of Jacobitism were known as , the conflict was more about inter-clan <b>politics</b> <b>than</b> about religion, and a significant factor was resistance to the territorial ambitions of the (Presbyterian) Campbells of Argyll. There was a precedent for post-1689 Jacobitism {{during the period of}} the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, when clans from the western Highlands had fought for James's father Charles I against the Campbells and the Covenanters. Another factor in Highland Jacobitism was James VII's sympathetic treatment of the Highland clans. Whereas previous monarchs since the late 16th century had been antagonistic to the Gaelic Highland way of life, James had worked sympathetically with the clan chieftains in the Commission for Pacifying the Highlands. Some Highland chieftains therefore viewed Jacobitism as a means of resisting hostile government intrusion into their territories. The significance of their support for the Stuarts was that the Highlands was the only part of Britain which still maintained private armies, in the form of clan levies. During the Jacobite Risings, they provided the bulk of Jacobite manpower.|$|E
25|$|The game then cuts to {{a cluster}} of villages near Forest Heart. As with the first game, {{the story is told}} through the journal entries of a soldier in The Legion, which is now led by Crüniac, who the {{soldiers}} think is more interested in <b>politics</b> <b>than</b> military matters, and spends its time on what the men perceive as trivial errands. Their latest assignment has them investigate reports of grave robbing, however, they are shocked to find the village of Willow Creek besieged by undead Ghasts. They clear the village, and learn the grave robbing leads to the keep of Baron Kildaer. They head to the keep and see hundreds of Thrall moving towards Tallow. Crüniac sends a runner to warn the villagers, while The Legion attack the keep. Crüniac proves a more skilled military tactician than his men believed, masterminding an attack which results in Kildaer's death. Soon thereafter, the runner returns with news that every village in the vicinity has been destroyed, and an undead army is amassing nearby. Crüniac sets fire to the Keep, and The Legion flee into the Clouspine Mountains.|$|E
