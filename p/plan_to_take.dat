5|$|In early July, Washington {{suggested}} an attack {{be made at}} {{the northern part of}} Manhattan Island, but his officers and Rochambeau all disagreed.

De Grasse encouraged Washington to move south so they could launch a joint operation. Washington abandoned his <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> New York, and began to prepare his army for the march south to Virginia.|$|E

5|$|As at Darwin, Herring's primary {{difficulty}} was logistics. The {{troops on}} the Kokoda Track had to be supplied from Port Moresby either by air or by Papuan native carriers who lugged stores over the track on their backs. MacArthur created the Combined Operation Service Command (COSC), an unusual combined Australian-American logistical organisation, under U.S. Brigadier General Dwight Johns, who in turn was answerable to Herring. Herring backed a <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> American engineers off working on the airstrips {{in order to develop}} the port by building a causeway to Tatana Island, the successful completion of which doubled the port's capacity and was the logistical turning point of the campaign.|$|E

5|$|In 1949 Palmer left Ziff-Davis and was {{replaced}} by Howard Browne, who was knowledgeable and enthusiastic about fantasy fiction. Browne briefly managed {{to improve the quality of}} the fiction in Fantastic Adventures, and the period around 1951 has been described as the magazine's heyday. Browne lost interest when his <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Amazing Stories upmarket collapsed, and the magazine fell back into predictability. In 1952, Ziff-Davis launched another fantasy magazine, titled Fantastic, in a digest format; it was successful, and within a few months the decision was taken to end Fantastic Adventures in favor of Fantastic. The March 1953 issue of Fantastic Adventures was the last.|$|E
5|$|In the laboratory, Susan, Russell, wrangler Carter Blake, marine {{biologist}} Janice Higgins, and engineer Tom Scoggins witness the shark smash Jim's stretcher against the laboratory's main window, drowning him and flooding the facility. With few options left, the group {{goes to the}} facility's wet entry, where they <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a submersible to escape. Upon being confronted, Susan confesses to the others that she and Jim genetically engineered the sharks to increase their brain size, as they were not large enough to harvest sufficient amounts of the protein complex; this has the side effect of making them smarter and deadly. When the group reaches the wet entry, they discover that the submersible has been damaged. While delivering a monologue emphasizing the need for group unity, Russell is dragged into the submersible pool by the shark and killed.|$|E

5|$|On August 27, 2003, the St. Joseph Valley Parkway freeway {{carrying}} US31 {{was completed}} from northwest of Berrien Springs (exit15) to Napier Avenue near Benton Harbor (exit24).

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 2006–07 season, Gannon and Stockport announced they had drawn up a five-year <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the club to the Championship. Results on the field followed this statement of intent, with Gannon leading County to a League record nine consecutive victories without conceding a goal. Gannon lodged a complaint with The Football Association against Bristol Rovers when a fixture was postponed due to a waterlogged pitch, as he felt not enough was done to ready the pitch, and also a complaint with regard to the referee's handling of the situation. Gannon was later incensed with the FA when the same referee was allowed to take charge of the postponed fixture, which Rovers won 2–1. Gannon also branded approaches from Manchester City and Liverpool questionable and unprofessional after the two Premier League clubs swooped for youngsters being trained in Stockport County's development squads.|$|E
5|$|Iris Crowe is {{the older}} sister of Brother Justin and a devoted {{supporter}} of his ministry duties in California. Iris' {{significance in the}} series starts when Brother Justin informs her about the church board's <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> away his new ministry.

5|$|Shortly after midnight, in {{the first}} minutes of 1 January 1966, Bokassa and Banza {{organized}} their troops and told them of their <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> over the government. Bokassa claimed that Dacko had resigned from the presidency and given the position to his close adviser Izamo. He then told the soldiers {{that they had to}} act now to prevent the gendarmerie from taking over the Central African Republic army. He then asked the soldiers if they would support his course of action; the men who refused were thrown in jail. At 00:30WAT, Banza, Bokassa and their supporters left Camp de Roux to take over the capital. They encountered little resistance and were able to take Bangui in a matter of hours. Bokassa and Banza then rushed to the Palais de la Renaissance, where they tried to arrest Dacko, who was not there.

5|$|Ölvir {{appears in}} the saga {{as the son of}} Þorljót, and Steinnvör 'the Stout'. The mother of Steinnvör is Frakökk, who has been {{described}} {{as one of the great}} villains of the entire saga. One of Frakökk's sisters, Helga, is the concubine of Earl Hákon Pálsson. Part of the saga relates of how the Earldom of Orkney is for a time jointly run by half-brothers—Haraldr Hákonsson and Páll Hákonsson, who are both sons of Earl Hákon. With the death of Earl Haraldr, son of Helga, Frakökk's family falls out of favour, and are forced to leave Orkney. In time, Frakökk conspire with the father of Earl Rögnvaldr, and agrees to a <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the Orkney by force and split it with Earl Rögnvaldr. She and Ölvir eventually make their way to the Suðreyjar, and may their return in a bid to win half of the earldom. However, their small fleet of ships are defeated in battle against Earl Páll. The saga also tells of how Ölvir kills an Orkney chieftain who fought against him during the sea-battle—by burning the man to death within his house. The chieftain's vengeful son later tracks down Ölvir and Frakökk, at their own home in Sutherland. After a short battle behind their homestead, Ölvir's men are routed and Frakökk is burned to death within her house; Ölvir flees from the scene, making for the Suðreyjar, and is not heard from again.|$|E
