The total number of bundles of cattle forage cut per year was estimated from the questionnaires. The weights of five bundles cut by men from the floodplain were estimated and compared with weights of five bundles we cut. The area cut on the floodplain was determined by relating the surveyed area on a sketch map to its equivalent on a surveyed map of part of the area. Productivity, biomass and turnover rate of the floodplain grassland were estimated. The turnover rate was found to be very large, partly due to some sampling errors.

40|$|Abstract – Complete {{inventories}} of the fauna {{at a given}} place, for a specific community or geographical area are often exceedingly hard to get. In recent years a number of estimation techniques have emerged {{that can be used}} to extrapolate from these samples to the true number of species in an area. These estimation models are based on different mathematical approaches and can be classified as either species accumulation curves or nonparametric estimators (Brose et al., 2003, Ecology, 84, 2364 – 2377). In this paper, we have tested the performance of some of the richness estimators on nineteen mountain ponds in Castilla y León (Spain) in order to provide guidance on their potential use in future researches. We collected benthic macroinvertebrate of these ponds from the littoral zone with a <b>pond</b> <b>net</b> by kicking and sweeping. Ten-second samples were collected in each pond up to a total time of 3 to 5 minutes per pond, depending on the pond size. In addition, two of the ponds, were sampled in 2004, 2006 and 2007 providing a three-year time series. The results of this study showed that Jackknife 2 was the best of the evaluated methods based on all chosen criteria and also performed well across all studied ponds. Jackknife 1, Chao 1 and Chao 2 also presented good results and they were inferior to Jackknife 2 mainly because of the requirement for larger sub-sample sizes...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{standardise}} biological assessment of surface waters in Europe, a standardised method for sampling, sorting and identification of benthic macroinvertebrates in running waters was {{developed during the}} AQEM project. The AQEM method {{has proved to be}} relatively time-consuming. Hence, this study explored the consequences of a reduction in sample size on costs and bioassessment results. Macroinvertebrate samples were collected from six different streams: four streams located in the Netherlands and two in Slovakia. In each stream 20 sampling units were collected with a <b>pond</b> <b>net</b> (25 × 25 cm), over a length of approximately 25 cm per sampling unit, from one or two habitats dominantly present. With the collected data, the effect of increasing sample size on variability and accuracy was examined for six metrics and a multimetric index developed for the assessment of Dutch slow running streams. By collecting samples from separate habitats it was possible to examine whether the coefficient of variation (CV; measure of variability) and the mean relative deviation from the ¿reference¿ sample (MRD; measure of accuracy) for different metrics depended only on sample size, or also on the type of habitat sampled. Time spent on sample processing (sorting and identification) was recorded for samples from the Dutch streams to assess the implications of changes in sample size on the costs of sample processing. Accuracy of metric results increased and variability decreased with increasing sample size. Accuracy and variability varied depending on the habitat and the metric, hence sample size should be based on the specific habitats present in a stream and the metric(s) used for bioassessment. The AQEM sampling method prescribes a multihabitat sample of 5 m. Our results suggest that a sample size of less than 5 m is adequate to attain a CV and MRD of ¿ 10 % for the metrics ASPT (Average Score per Taxon), Saprobic Index and type Aka+Lit+Psa (%) (the percentage of individuals with a preference for the akal, littoral and psammal). The metrics number of taxa, number of individuals and EPT-taxa (%) required a multihabitat sample size of more than 5 m to attain a CV and MRD of ¿ 10 %. For the metrics number of individuals and number of taxa a multihabitat sample size of 5 m is not even adequate to attain a CV and MRD of ¿ 20 %. Accuracy of the multimetric index for Dutch slow running streams can be increased from ¿ 20 to ¿ 10 % with an increase in labour time of 2 h. Considering this low increase in costs and the possible implications of incorrect assessment results it is recommended to strive for this ¿ 10 % accuracy. To achieve an accuracy of ¿ 10 % a multihabitat sample of the four habitats studied in the Netherlands would require a sample size of 2. 5 m and a labour time of 26 h (excluding identification of Oligochaeta and Diptera) or 38 h (including identification of Oligochaeta and Diptera).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of season, habitat, hydroperiod and water chemistry on the distribution of turlough aquatic invertebrate communities. Twenty-two turloughs, selected as representative of geographical distribution and hydrological conditions were included in the study. A comparative study of eight turloughs representing a nutrient gradient determined macroinvertebrate community distinctiveness in a stratified sampling design and related assemblage structures to environmental variables. Assessment of macroinvertebrate temporal and spatial variation was the objective of separate studies conducted in a subset of four turloughs, varying in hydrological and nutrient regimes. The influence of disturbance and habitat characteristics on macroinvertebrate community dynamics was tested. Across twenty-two turloughs macroinvertebrate and cladoceran zooplankton communities were analysed and their relation to varying trophic, hydrological and morphological regimes identified. For a comparative study of macroinvertebrates eight turloughs were selected to represent a gradient of total phosphorus (TP) concentrations. To allow comparability of turlough macroinvertebrate communities, samples were collected from one habitat type (submerged grassland) in April 2007 using a simple box sampler. Five replicates were collected in every turlough by rapidly lowering the box to the substratum and removing trapped organisms with a net. Community analysis identified highly distinct macroinvertebrate assemblages, indicating that a single or pooled sample can provide a reliable description of turlough macroinvertebrate communities. Hydroperiod influenced mean taxon richness and abundance of macroinvertebrates but no correlation was found between nutrient status and either mean taxon richness or abundance. In order to study temporal dynamics of macroinvertebrates in turloughs, littoral faunal samples were collected over a one to two year period in four turloughs with differing hydrological and nutrient regimes. Sampling was carried out using a standardised sampling approach. Five replicate samples were collected every month using a box sampler from the dominant turlough habitat, submerged grassland. Macroinvertebrate biodiversity and community structure varied monthly and interannually. A two-phased hydrocycle was identified with permanent residents dominating during the start of the hydrocycle, with an increase of ephemeral taxa over time. Disturbance, as demonstrated by short hydroperiod and high areal reduction rate had an important effect on macroinvertebrate community structure in turloughs, with high disturbance generally supporting lower faunal diversity. Influence of disturbance generally decreased over time leading to a stabilization of macroinvertebrate communities. For the study of spatial variation of macroinvertebrates in turloughs two habitats were sampled in two turloughs during sampling season 2006 / 2007 using a box sampler and five replicates were collected in each habitat. Within-habitat variability was assessed by collecting five replicate macroinvertebrate samples from four different submerged grassland habitat sites in four turloughs in sampling season 2007 / 2008 using the box sampler. While habitat specific preferences were found for some taxa of conservation concern variability of macroinvertebrates within turloughs was nevertheless identified to be smaller than among turloughs. Macroinvertebrate samples collected in any location of the dominant turlough habitat (submerged grassland) were identified as reliable indicators of ecological change of turloughs. A comparative study of macroinvertebrates and cladoceran zooplankton communities was conducted across twenty-two turloughs, representing a wide hydromorphological and geographical range. Macroinvertebrate samples were collected in November 2006 and April 2007 using a stratified sampling approach. All available habitats in a turlough were sampled proportional to their availability using sweeps with a standard FBA <b>pond</b> <b>net.</b> Three minute sampling time was subdivided proportionally to each habitat?s availability. Cladoceran zooplankton and separate chydorid samples were collected from twenty turloughs in April 2007 by horizontal hauls with a zooplankton net from the shore and a perspex tube, respectively. Varying associations of macroinvertebrate as well as zooplankton communities to environmental variables season, TP concentrations, number of habitats sampled and hydroperiod of turloughs were detected. Some macroinvertebrate orders and zooplankton species showed significant relationships with chemical descriptors of nutrient enrichment. Turlough macroinvertebrate communities are highly distinct and conducive to time and cost-effective monitoring. Collection of a single submerged grassland sample reduces inherent `noise? and is suited for the detection of pressure gradients. The number of habitats sampled should, however, depend on the objective of the sampling. Sampling for more holistic purposes should be carried out using a multi-habitat sampling approach to obtain a more comprehensive survey of turlough biodiversity. Season had an important influence on macroinvertebrate community structures. Turlough sampling regimes need a flexible approach with timing and frequency of sampling depending on sampling protocol objectives and should be geared towards the start of the flooding season and variable hydrocycles. Turloughs are inherently variable systems which might negate the development of simple type-specific reference conditions as required for lakes under the WFD...|$|E

Unsustainable culture practices such as dependence on wild caught seeds, use of trash fish, use of high stocking densities, and unregulated expansion and proliferation of fish cages, have led to the "boom and bust" cycle of grouper aquaculture in the Philippines. The drastic decrease in grouper aquaculture production in the late 90 's was mainly attributed to environmental deterioration and diseases outbreaks. To sustain grouper production, research on the breeding, seed production and culture of groupers started in the mid 1980 s. As a regional inter-government R&D organization, the Aquaculture Department of the Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center (SEAFDEC/AQD) followed the recommendations of the 1987 Seminar-Workshop on Aquaculture Development in Southeast Asia on grouper R&D. Research activities initially focused on market survey of grouper species in the Philippines and Southeast Asia, assessment of fry and availability in traditional fishing grounds, and development of broodstock management techniques. Following the spontaneous spawning of Epinephelus coioides in concrete tanks and floating net cages in 1990 's, protocols for the seed production of milkfish and sea bass were adapted and modified.

50|$|Pond {{hockey is}} a form of ice hockey very similar in its object and {{appearance}} to traditional ice hockey, but far simpler and designed to be played on part of a natural frozen body of water. The rink is 50-80% the size of a standard NHL-specification rink, and has no boards or glass surrounding it to add to the convenience of setting up and removing the rink (usually only a barrier of snow keeps the puck in play). In addition, because there are no protective barriers behind the goal to contain high errant shots, the top of the goal is far lower, in fact only slightly taller than the width of a puck, and the game more often than not does not have a formal goalie. Because of these differences, pond hockey places more emphasis on skating and puckhandling ability and less on shooting and checking.

The growth in Karapad pond, where supplementary feed was provided was better than in Veppalodai pond. The highest growth rate was obtained in net cage culture at Tuticorin Bay. Length-frequency analysis of samples from commercial catch reveal a faster growth in the wild than in the culture systems. The better growth in the brackishwater culture and in the wild is attributed to the lower salinity and better live feed availability in brackishwater. In the pond system, the growth can be improved by maintaining proper water exchange so as to maintain the salinity equivalent to open sea/bay/ brackishwaters and by providing supplementary feed...|$|R
40|$|Salmonid {{fish are}} {{important}} species for hatchery reared and released fish. Flounders and shrimp {{are also important}} species for seed production and sea-farming in Japan. Viral disease {{is one of the}} limitations of successful propagation of these species. Methods currently used to control viral diseases are 1) hygiene and sanitation in facilities, 2) disinfection of rearing and waste water using U. V. irradiation, ozonization and electrolyzation, 3) selection of pathogen-free brood stock by cell culture isolation and detection of specific antibody against important pathogens with ELISA or viral gene with PCR, 4) health monitoring of hatched fry by cell culture isolation and detection of pathogens by immunological and molecular biological methods, 5) control of normal intestinal flora by feeding bacteria producing antiviral substances, and 6) temperature manipulation. Under these circumstances, hatched fish and shrimp are healthy and specific pathogen free, but there is still a possibility of infection by some pathogens in environmental waters after they are moved to <b>ponds</b> or <b>net</b> pens outside of facilities. For prospective studies, development of effective vaccines, vaccine injection machines and immunological tools for evaluation of vaccination effect are necessary...|$|R

40|$|Among {{the most}} {{prevalent}} wetland and deep-water habitats in Alaska are ponds, {{many of which are}} subarctic ponds occurring as moraine, ice-scour, or dead-ice depressions. Many are closed-basin depressions, where surface-water inflows and outflows are negligible. The objective {{of this study was to}} quantify the water sources and hydrodynamics of these subarctic ponds, particularly with respect to the role they play in groundwater recharge. There are two types of ponds on the study site. Perched-precipitation ponds have inflows by melt water and direct precipitation, outflows by evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge, and are seasonally inundated because surface water is perched above the water table and infiltration through the low-permeability surficial deposits to the water table is slow. Flow-through ponds have inflows by melt water, direct precipitation, and groundwater discharge, outflows by evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge, and are perennially inundated because of groundwater throughflow. Both are groundwater recharge focal points. This is particularly true for perched-precipitation <b>ponds,</b> where <b>net</b> groundwater recharge rates were 215 % larger than in flow-through ponds, and 332 % larger than in the broader landscape. Most of the additional groundwater recharge occurs immediately following breakup, as aeolian-transported snow trapped in the depressions melts which results in enhanced groundwater recharge rates...|$|R

Não houve efeito dos teores de milheto sobre o peso final, ganho de peso, conversão alimentar aparente, taxa de eficiência protéica e sobrevivência dos alevinos. Foi observado efeito quadrático para o custo/kg ganho, em que o menor custo foi obtido com 20, 31 % de inclusão de milheto. Conclui-se que o milheto pode ser incluído em até 30, 00 % em substituição ao milho nas rações para alevinos de piavuçu, sem afetar o desempenho. Aiming to {{evaluate}} the effects of including millet (Pennisetum americanum) in diets for piavuçu, Leporinus macrocephalus, were utilized 240 fingerlings with initial weight of 1. 38 ± 0. 03 g, distributed in randomized blocks with six treatments (0. 00; 6. 00; 12. 00; 18. 00; 24. 00 and 30. 00 % of millet in diets) and five replicates, in 30 <b>net</b> <b>ponds</b> (120 L) installed in five cement abestos tanks (1, 000 L), with eight animals in each <b>net</b> <b>ponds.</b> There was no effect of millet inclusion on the final weight, weight gain, apparent alimentary conversion, rate of efficiency proteic and survival of the fingerlings. Quadratic effect was observed for the cost/kg gain with the minimum cost at 20. 31 % of inclusion. It was concluded that millet can be included into 30. 00 % in substitution to the maize in diets for piavuçu fry, without affecting the performance...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the results of three of the tests {{performed}} on the Nebraska modified roof pond. During the summer of 1985,? with the test room decoupled from the roof pond itself, several series of tests were initiated. The first experiment (fig. 1) was to test the overall response of the system by forcing the temperature in storage to a preset value and observe its decay / curve with ponding and spray. The second experiment (fig* 2) was similar to the first but with ponding only and no spray. Experiment three (fig. 3) observed the discharge of heat from pond with the-pump turned off, in essence a natural decay test without roof <b>pond</b> cooling. <b>Net</b> night sky radiation,, ambient air and pond temperatures, and dew point temperature were measured. The water in the roof pond was heated electrically to about 500 C and then permitted to cool in various ways. With the pump on in experiments 1 and 2 the convection and evaporation losses were considerably larger than the radiative losses; at the elevated water temperatures the evaporative and convective losses were significantly higher than at the lower water temperatures; the convective-evaporative losses when ponding and ponding with spray are comparable. The losses from the system without active cooling strategies are mainly due to evaporation thru or refluxing in the cracks of the floating insulation and to convection...|$|R
