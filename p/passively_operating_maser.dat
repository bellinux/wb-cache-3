40|$|For safety reasons, to {{preserve}} a proper appearance and to ensure a long life cycle, facades have to be maintained regularly. Until now, this {{has been done by}} human workers. However, due to overhangs and structurally weak facades, work on outer facades can be a difficult and dangerous job. Thus there is a high potential for the deployment of autonomous or remote controlled facade climbing robots. But for a facility management provider such a robot only becomes interesting if it is usable across a large number of buildings. In this context free climbing robots are the most appropriate system for an all-purpose deployment. The majority of existing free climbing robots use suction cups for attachment, which are actively provided with vacuum by an extra vacuum generator. In this context <b>passively</b> <b>operated</b> suction cups have the advantage that the attaching force is generated simply by mechanically pressing the suction cup onto the surface. In the scope of this work it is shown that the weight and the complexity of the robot system can be reduced and thus the flexibility of deployment and the reliability of free climbing robots could be increased by using <b>passively</b> <b>operated</b> suction cups. The chosen system for a free climbing robot with <b>passively</b> <b>operated</b> suction cups utilises the caterpillar principle for propulsion. In order to produce suitable pressure at the front suction cups a specific attach system for suction cup suspension has been developed in this work. To calculate the characteristic forces for this climbing system that affect the suction cups the necessary mathematical process has been developed and design rules for the minimization of these forces has been derived. The sheer load has been identified as being the critical load to the suction cups. Thus the focus of this work was the development of a mathematical model for the determination of the elastic and failure behaviour of <b>passively</b> <b>operated</b> suction cups. These forces cause slippage and thus the elastic and failure behavior of the suction cups. The mathematical model for simulating the determination of the coherence between sheer forces and slippage drift {{as a function of the}} normal force has been worked out on the basis of the finite element method, and has been verified by tests. Therefore a two dimensional friction model has been developed and a new parameter to consider material expansion in the normal direction has been introduced. In an exemplary test series it has been verified that the model reproduces real conditions to an adequate accuracy. For practical use this basic system can be used for the dimensioning of <b>passively</b> <b>operated</b> suctions cups and thus for the dimensioning of climbing robots for glass facades. On the basis of this knowledge a prototype for a free climbing and autonomous robot for glass facades has been built and tested. The tests have been carried out on the functionality of the new climbing mechanism on the basis of a caterpillar with <b>passively</b> <b>operated</b> suction cups, and of the behaviour of the suction cups with different loads and different patterns of suction cup arrangements. The functionality of the climbing mechanism has been proven. Important knowledge for the optimisation of the climbing mechanism has been obtained from the interpretation of the behaviour of the suction cups during the testing in comparison with the results of the mathematical model...|$|R

40|$|This paper verifies the {{efficiency}} of a smart passive system based on MR damper through the experimental study. A Magnetorheological (MR) damper {{is one of the}} most promising control devices for earthquake hazard mitigation, because it has many advantages such as small power requirement, reliability, and low price to manufacture. However, it is not easy to apply the MR damper-based control system to large-scale civil structures because of the difficulties of building up with power supply and maintaining the control system individually. An Electromagnetic induction (EMI) system for MR dampers can be used to resolve these problems. According to the Faraday’s law of induction, the EMI system changes kinetic energy of the structure to electric energy, and then the electric energy is used to vary the damping characteristics of the MR damper to control the vibration of structure. The experiments of EMI system for MR damper are performed and the results are compared with the <b>passively</b> <b>operated</b> MR damper-based control systems...|$|R

The method is applied to an out-of-plane, spiral-coil microactuator based on shape-memory-alloy (SMA). The SMA spiral coil forms an inductor-capacitor resonant circuit that is excited using external RF magnetic fields to thermally actuate the coil. The actuation causes {{a shift in the}} circuit’s resonance as the coil is displaced vertically, which is wirelessly monitored through an external antenna to track the displacements.

40|$|The {{penetration}} of wind power into the electricity grid is growing significantly. A {{significant portion of}} this wind power is being installed in distribution systems, of which most are <b>passively</b> <b>operated.</b> Under this operating practice, wind power can only be admitted based on minimum load and maximum generation consideration. This severely limits the wind power hosting capacity of the system. Hence, the use of active-management strategies (AMSs) has been proposed to increase the hosting capacity of distribution systems. This paper incorporates AMSs into two optimization models whose objectives are to maximize the net benefit of distribution system operator and wind farm owner, respectively. The AMSs considered are wind energy curtailment, coordinated on-load tap changer voltage control, and reactive power compensation.

The benefit of the tubular geometry compared to the planar geometry is the higher instantaneous volumetric power density provided by the larger active area, which could be beneficial in applications that require a high instantaneous power while occupying a small volume. First, a two-dimensional, two-phase, non-isothermal model was developed to investigate the steady-state performance and design characteristics of a tubular-shaped, passive DMFC. It was found that a higher ambient temperature improves fuel cell performance, but also increases both methanol and water crossover.

40|$|The MAX IV storage rings, {{currently}} {{under construction in}} Lund, Sweden, will use third harmonic cavities <b>operated</b> <b>passively</b> to lengthen the bunches and alleviate collective instabilities. These cavities are an essential ingredient in the MAX IV design concept and are required for achieving the final design goals in terms of stored current, beam emittance, and beam lifetime—such performance challenges are in fact common to all recent ultralow emittance storage ring designs and harmonic cavities are {{currently under}} consideration in several laboratories. In this paper, we report on parametric studies comparing different harmonic cavity settings {{in terms of the}} resulting bunch length, peak bunch density, and incoherent synchrotron frequency spread for the MAX IV 3  GeV ring. The equilibrium longitudinal bunch density distribution was calculated by establishing a self-consistent equation for the bunch form factor, describing the bunch shape. The calculations are fully self-consistent in the sense that not only the amplitude but also the phase of the waves excited by the beam in the harmonic cavity were assumed to be a function of the bunch shape, which allowed us to explore a wide parameter range not restricted to the region close to the conditions for which the first and second derivatives of the total rf voltage are zero at the synchronous phase. Our results indicate that up to a factor 5 increase in rms bunch length is achievable with a purely passive system for the MAX IV 3  GeV ring while keeping a relatively large harmonic cavity detuning, thus limiting the unavoidable Robinson antidamping rate from the fundamental mode of a <b>passively</b> <b>operated</b> harmonic cavity to values below the synchrotron radiation damping rate.

The proposed smart passive system also incorporates a roller chain and sprocket, transforming the linear motion of the cable into the rotational motion of the DC generator.

A multitude of polymer-based electronic and electrochemical devices and sensors have been developed, of which some already has reached the consumer market. This thesis focuses on polarization characteristics in polyelectrolyte-based capacitor structures and their role in sensors, transistors and supercapacitors. The fate of the ions in these capacitor structures, within the polyelectrolyte and at the interfaces between the polyelectrolyte and various electronic conductors (a metal, a semiconducting polymer or a network of carbon nanotubes), is of outermost importance for the device function.

40|$|In {{contrast}} {{with the majority of}} flowering plants, where pollen is released directly from the anthers to travel to the female organ to effect fertilization, the pollen in certain species belonging to fifteen families worldwide is initially deposited on the female part of the flower before transport to another flower occurs. The structure on which the pollen is deposited is (in almost all cases) a modification of the style called the pollen presenter. In South Africa, pollen presenters are ubiquitous in the Asteraceae, Campanulaceae, Lobeliaceae, Goodeniaceae and Proteaceae; they also occur in almost half of the genera in the Rubiaceae, and in Polygala and some Muraltia (Polygalaceae), in Turraea, Trichilia and Ekebergia (Meliaceae) and a small proportion of taxa in the Fabaceae.

A viable solution to this problem is the widespread adoption of nuclear breeder reactor technology. Innovative breeder reactor concepts using liquid-metal coolants such as sodium or lead will be able to utilize the waste produced by the current light water reactor fuel cycle to power the entire world for several centuries to come. Breed & burn (B&B) type fast reactor cores can unlock the energy potential of readily available fertile material such as depleted uranium without the need for chemical reprocessing.

40|$|Fish {{personality}} traits, such as swimming activity, or personality related emergent behavioural properties, such as {{the degree}} of space use shown by an individual fish, should affect encounter rates between individual fish and fishing gear. Increased encounters should in turn drive vulnerability to capture by <b>passively</b> <b>operated</b> gears. However, empirical evidence documenting a relationship between activity-based behaviours and vulnerability to capture by passive fishing gear in the wild is limited. Using whole-lake acoustic telemetry, we first documented significant repeatabilities over several months in a suite of encounter rate-associated behaviours (swimming distance, activity space size, time on baited feeding sites, switching frequency among baited feeding sites, distance to the lake bottom) in two recreationally important benthivorous cyprinid species, the common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and tench (Tinca tinca). We then experimentally targeted both species using stationary angling on baited feeding sites. Individual fish regularly visited the angling sites, documenting that the fishes encountered the angling baits. When attempting to explain individual variation in vulnerability {{as a function of}} repeatable behavioural traits, we found no evidence of a significant relationship among various encounter-based behaviours and vulnerability to angling for both species. There was also no evidence for size selection or for energetically less conditioned fish to be more vulnerable. The data cumulatively suggest that fine-scale behaviours after encountering a bait (e. g., frequency of bait intake) may be ultimately decisive for determining vulnerability to angling in benthivorous fish. Based on our work, fishing-induced selection on encounter-based behaviours in recreational angling for benthivorous fish in the wild appears unlikely...|$|R
40|$|In <b>passively</b> <b>operated</b> fishing gear, boldness-related {{behaviors}} should fundamentally {{affect the}} vulnerability of individual fish and thus be under fisheries selection. To test this hypothesis, we used juvenile common-garden reared carp (Cyprinus carpio) within a narrow size range to investigate the mechanistic basis of behavioral selection caused by angling. We focused on one key personality trait (i. e., boldness), measured in groups within ponds, two morphological traits (body shape and head shape), and one lifehistory trait (juvenile growth capacity) and studied mean standardized selection gradients caused by angling. Carp behavior was highly repeatable within ponds. In the short term, over seven days of fishing, total length, not boldness, was the main predictor of angling vulnerability. However, after 20 days of fishing, boldness {{turned out to be}} the main trait under selection, followed by juvenile growth rate, while morphological traits were only weakly related to angling vulnerability. In addition, we found juvenile growth rate to be moderately correlated with boldness. Hence, direct selection on boldness will also induce indirect selection on juvenile growth and vice versa, but given that the two traits are not perfectly correlated, independent evolution of both traits is also possible. Our study is among the first to mechanistically reveal that energy-acquisitionrelated behaviors, and not growth rate per se, are key factors determining the probability of capture, and hence, behavioral traits appear to be the prime targets of angling selection. We predict an evolutionary response toward increased shyness in intensively angling-exploited fish stocks, possibly causing the emergence of a timidity syndrome...|$|R

Two prototypes of mLHP, one with a disk-shaped evaporator, 30 mm diameter and 10 mm thick, {{and the other with}} a rectangular-shaped evaporator, 47 Ã¿Â¿ 37 mm 2 plan area and 5 mm thick, were designed to handle heat fluxes up to 50 W/cm 2. In the disk-shaped evaporator, the compensation chamber was incorporated into the overall thickness of the evaporator, whereas for the rectangular-shaped evaporator a new design approach was used in which the compensation chamber was positioned {{on the sides of the}} wick structure such that it was coplanar with the evaporator section. The new design approach helped to decrease the thickness of the rectangular evaporator by 50 % and therefore improved the ability to integrate miniature loop heat pipe technology into compact electronics enclosures.

A 3 GeV linear accelerator serves as a full-energy injector into both rings {{as well as a}} driver for a short-pulse facility, in which undulators produce X-ray pulses as short as 100 fs. The 3 GeV ring employs a multibend achromat (MBA) lattice to achieve, in a relatively short circumference of 528 m, a bare lattice emittance of 0. 33 nm rad, which reduces to 0. 2 nm rad as insertion devices are added. The engineering implementation of the MBA lattice raises several technological problems. The large number of strong magnets per achromat calls for a compact design featuring small-gap combined-function magnets grouped into cells and sharing a common iron yoke. The small apertures lead to a low-conductance vacuum chamber design that relies on the chamber itself as a distributed copper absorber for the heat deposited by synchrotron radiation, while non-evaporable getter (NEG) coating provides for reduced photodesorption yields and distributed pumping. Finally, a low main frequency (100 MHz) is chosen for the RF system yielding long bunches, which are further elongated by <b>passively</b> <b>operated</b> third-harmonic Landau cavities, thus alleviating collective effects, both coherent (e. g. resistive wall instabilities) and incoherent (intrabeam scattering).

40|$|Harvesting {{wild animals}} may exert size-independent {{selection}} pressures {{on a range}} of morphological, life history, and behavioral traits. Most work so far has focused on selection pressures on life history traits and body size as morphological trait. We studied here how recreational fishing selects for morphological traits related to body shape, which may correlate with underlying swimming behavior. Using landmark-based geometric morphometrics, we found consistent recreational fishing-induced selection pressures on body shape in two recreationally exploited marine fish species. We show that individuals with larger-sized mouths and more streamlined and elongated bodies were more vulnerable to <b>passively</b> <b>operated</b> hook-and-line fishing independent of the individual's body size or condition. While the greater vulnerability of individuals with larger mouth gapes {{can be explained by the}} direct physical interaction with hooks, selection against streamlined and elongated individuals could either involve a specific foraging mode or relate to underlying elevated swimming behavior. Harvesting using passive gear is common around the globe, and thus, size-independent selection on body shape is expected to be widespread potentially leaving behind individuals with smaller oral gapes and more compact bodies. This might have repercussions for food webs by altering foraging and predation. © 2014 The Authors. Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

It is found that the surface recombination to molecular hydrogen, which might be considered as undesirable, is actually necessary to achieve the masing conditions. We develop the maser equations and consider a number of realistic conditions for operation...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{explore the}} {{potential}} of Nd:YAG single-crystal fibers for the amplification of <b>passively</b> Q-switched microlasers <b>operating</b> below 1 ns. Different regimes are tested in single or double pass configurations. For high gain and high power amplification this novel gain medium provided average powers up to 20 W at high repetition rate (over 40 kHz) for a pulse duration of 1 ns. As an energy amplifier, Nd:YAG single-crystal fiber delivered 2. 7 mJ, 6 MW 450 ps pulses at 1 kHz. The extraction efficiencies vary from 8 % to 32. 7 % following the configurations...|$|R
