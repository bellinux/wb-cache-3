A singly charged deuterium ion under the sample conditions would have acquired roughly X/1.41ms−1. If a detector was <b>placed</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>distance</b> of 1m, the ion flight times would be 1/X and 1.41/Xs.

25|$|Fort Campbell is very {{different}} from earlier fortifications in Malta, such as the bastioned forts built by the Knights Hospitaller and the polygonal forts built by the British in the 19th century. Due to the new threat of aerial warfare, the fort was surrounded by a thin wall, and the buildings were <b>placed</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>distance</b> from each other. Due to this, the fort was camouflaged as from the air it resembled the field walls of the surrounding countryside. Unlike many of the earlier fortifications, Fort Campbell was designed with an eye to functionality rather than aesthetics. For example, the fort's gateway is just a breach in the perimeter wall defended by a guard room, in contrast with the usually ornate gates of many Hospitaller or Victorian forts.|$|E
500|$|Mask of the Lunar Eclipse was co-developed by Koei Tecmo, Grasshopper Manufacture and Nintendo Software Planning & Development. Koei Tecmo was {{in charge}} of the {{gameplay}} and atmosphere, Grasshopper Manufacture were put in charge of character motion and other unspecified aspects of development, while Nintendo managed general production. Makoto Shibata and Keisuke Kikuchi, series creators and respective director and producer of the previous games in the series, returned to their respective posts. In addition, Grasshopper Manufacture's Goichi Suda acted as a co-director, co-writer and designer. Suda was initially reluctant to work on the project due to his intense dislike for ghosts and horror games. According to a later interview with Kikuchi, he was first inspired when he saw the potential in the Wii hardware, and was the first to propose the project to Nintendo. The main development goal for Mask of the Lunar Eclipse was [...] "feeling fear with [...] body", with gameplay functions closely tied into the Wii hardware. Among these were feeding sounds through the Wii remote's speaker and creating effects using the rumble function. An adjustment they made was to the camera perspective: while it had been <b>placed</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>distance</b> in previous games, it was shifted to an over-the-shoulder third-person view so the control of the torch was more realistic. This raised concerns as to the pace of the character's movement. Taking into account similar criticisms from fans of earlier games, the characters' speed was increased. This aspect was undergoing revision until quite late into development.|$|E

[...] A {{deceptively simple}} design, the circuit {{provided}} {{a tap on}} the primary winding of the output transformer to provide feedback to the second grid, which improved the amplifier's linearity.

2500|$|Figure 2 shows a more {{complicated}} grating configuration that involves focusing elements, here depicted as lenses. The lenses are <b>placed</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>distance</b> [...] from each other (they act as a 1:1 telescope), and at a distance [...] from the gratings. If , the setup acts as a positive-dispersion stretcher and if , it is a negative-dispersion stretcher. And the case [...] {{is used in the}} pulse shaper. Usually, the focusing element is a spherical or cylindrical mirror rather than a lens. As with the configuration in Figure 1, it is possible to use an additional mirror and use a single grating rather than two separate ones. This setup requires that the beam diameter is very small compared to the length of the telescope; otherwise undesirable aberrations will be introduced. For this reason, it is normally used as a stretcher before the amplification stage, since the low-intensity seed pulses can be collimated to a beam with a small diameter.|$|E

So complete had been the quiet throughout the country since the Egyptian occupation that the garrison had ceased to take any precautions whatever. No watch was set, and the gates of the city were seldom closed even at night.|$|E

The house was roomy, and like most of the houses at that date had a large courtyard paved with red tiles and planted with small lemon trees and flowering shrubs of various kinds. The streets were straight and narrow, paved with round boulder stones the size of a football, the pavements with brick or flagstones, and so narrow they would hardly admit of more than two persons walking abreast. Along the pavements {{on each side of the}} street were rows of posts <b>placed</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>distance</b> of ten yards apart.

As they were then paved the streets must have been the noisiest in the world, on account of the immense numbers of big springless carts in them.

He was not sorry to be thus able to watch her, though he did not see her in the point of view in which she pleased him best. She looked better now, he thought, than in the court dress; for the broad, simple, antique braids of her dark hair, only adorned by two large pearl pins, suited better than the plumes and lappets, with the cast of her classical features. All that he had thought promised beauty, as a child, had fulfilled the promise, and the countenance, the expression, would have been fine, seen on a much plainer face, and as she eat there, her black, shady eyes cast down, her dark pencilled eyebrows contrasting with her colourless cheek, and her plain white drapery in full folds, flowing round her, she might have been some majestic lady in a mysterious picture, who had stepped from her frame into a scene belonging to another age. She looked as if she was acting a tableau; she moved, indeed, and smiled, and spoke occasionally; but the queen-like deportment of her neck did not relax; her lips resumed their statue-like expression; there was no smile about the eye, no interest in the air. She was among the company, but not of them; neither shy nor formal, but as if she belonged to some other sphere, and had only come there by mistake. Edmund could have counted the times, for they were few enough, when her head bent forward with eagerness, and there was animation in her face.|$|E
