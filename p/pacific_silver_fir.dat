5|$|The {{climate of}} Adams {{gives it a}} large amount of {{diversity}} within its forests. On the west side, down in the lower valleys, grand fir and Douglas fir dominate the forest with Western hemlock and Western red cedar as well. On the east side, Douglas fir and ponderosa pine are dominant with some patches of dense lodgepole pine. Western hemlock and Western red cedar also occur, but are limited to creek and river bottoms. Grand fir is present on sites with better moisture retention. At middle elevations on the west side, grand fir is increasingly replaced by <b>Pacific</b> <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> and noble fir; and on the east side, lodgepole becomes much more prevalent. Above a certain elevation, lodgepole pine also appears in areas on the west side as well. As elevation increases further, the forest changes again with subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, and mountain hemlock becoming the dominant tree species on all sides of the mountain. Eventually, the last trees to disappear from the mountainside are the highly cold tolerant whitebark pine and mountain hemlock. Other conifers, 18 species in all, that play a lesser role than the dominant species are Western white pine, Sitka spruce, Western larch, Pacific yew, Alaska cedar, and mountain juniper. Adams is also home to many hardwoods as well including the tree species big leaf maple, Oregon white oak, quaking aspen, black cottonwood, and red alder. Large shrubs/small trees include the dwarf birch, Suksdorf’s hawthorn, California hazelnut, bitter cherry, vine maple, Douglas maple, and blue elderberry and contribute to a vibrant fall display.|$|E
25|$|The {{ecology of}} the area can be {{understood}} by following a west-to-east line {{at the southern end}} of the North Cascades, at approximately 47.5 degrees north. As the line passes through the Cascade range, it passes through a number of ecoregions, first getting higher and colder, then getting warmer, yet drier. Each of these component ecoregions can be described by either a tree indicator species, or by a lack of trees: western hemlock, <b>Pacific</b> <b>silver</b> <b>fir,</b> subalpine mountain hemlock, alpine, subalpine fir, and grand fir/Douglas fir.|$|E
5|$|The Cascade Range is {{dramatically}} different in climate from west to east. The west side is heavily forested and features trees such as Douglas <b>firs,</b> western hemlock, <b>Pacific</b> <b>silver</b> <b>firs,</b> and Alaska yellow cedars. East of the Cascades, where Yamsay lies, the climate becomes much drier, even arid. Precipitation significantly declines and vegetation becomes more sparse, with lodgepole pine, white fir, ponderosa pine, and juniper.

500|$|Over {{the past}} 150 years, a {{significant}} change for the Willamette River has been the loss of its floodplain forests, which covered an estimated 89percent of a [...] band along each river bank in 1850. By 1990 only 37percent of this zone was forested; the rest had been converted to farm fields or cleared for urban or suburban uses. The remaining forests close to the river include large stands of black cottonwood, Oregon ash, willow, and bigleaf maple. The central valley—a former perennial grass prairie interspersed with oaks, ponderosa pines, and other trees—is devoted almost entirely to farming. Douglas fir, western hemlock, and western red cedar dominate the forest on the Coast Range side of the basin.

500|$|Image Lake and the {{surrounding}} area is in the North Cascades ecoregion, and temperate rainforests grow at lower elevations, such as in the Suiattle River valley. Common trees in this habitat include western redcedar, western hemlock, and Douglas fir. At middle elevations, forests are dominated by <b>Pacific</b> <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> and, to a lesser extent, Alaska cedar. Devil's club and huckleberry grow in moist areas on the forest floor. However, beargrass and salal dominate in drier areas. The mid-elevation forests also receive more precipitation, especially in the form of snowfall, than lower elevations. Western hemlock and Douglas fir are also present, especially at the lower edge of the mid-elevation forest zone. At higher elevations, Douglas fir and redcedar are largely replaced by mountain hemlock and Alaska cedar, which both become more common as elevation increases. [...] The mid-elevation forest zone often occupies the steepest slopes on the mountainside, which result in the occurrence of avalanche tracks. Avalanche tracks are usually occupied by scrub such as Sitka alder, as well as smaller shrubs and herbs.|$|E

40|$|We {{analysed}} {{the characteristics}} of <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> (Abies alba Mill.) occurrence and distribution in Slovenia using databases of the Slovenian Forest Service (SFS). <b>Silver</b> <b>fir</b> is the third most widely distributed tree species in Slovenia, occurring in approximately 40 % of total forest area, but abundantly in less than 10 %. Its share in total growing stock varies between separate forest management regions. It is more abundant in the Dinaric {{and part of the}} Pre-alpine phytogeographic regions. The highest share in total growing stock reaches at altitudes between 800 m and 1000 m above sea level, forests with <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> cover the most extensive surface in the altitude belt from 1000 to 1200 m. <b>Silver</b> <b>fir</b> occurs abundantly in 11 syntaxes.

The common growth characteristic of the two trees, a 450 -year-old tree as the main study object (labeled Tree A) and a 270 -year-old Tree B is a long stagnation stage. For Tree A the latent phase, with small interruptions, lasted 410 years; one phase lasted 330 years in continuity, which is the longest period of <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> stagnation recorded in Europe. Tree B showed a long-lasting stagnation stage that lasted 170 years. The long stagnation stage of Tree A, characterized by an average diameter increment of 1. 4 mm/year (average growth ring width of 0. 7 mm) and an average height increment of 0. 08 m/year, shows the extraordinary <b>silver</b> <b>fir</b> capacity for physiological survival in complete shade.
