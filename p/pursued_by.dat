Central to the argument is a nested goal/sub-goal hierarchy that the authors claim is inherent to the structure of epistemically responsible belief-formation: <b>pursuing</b> true beliefs <b>by</b> <b>pursuing</b> beliefs that are objectively likely given one’s total available evidence; <b>pursuing</b> this sub-goal <b>by</b> <b>pursuing</b> beliefs that are likely true (given that evidence) relative to one’s own deep epistemic sensibility; and <b>pursuing</b> this sub-sub-goal <b>by</b> forming beliefs in accordance with one’s own all-in, ultima facie, epistemic seemings...|$|R
