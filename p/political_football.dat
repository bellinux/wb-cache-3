5|$|The {{government}} {{response to}} the strike and riot became a <b>political</b> <b>football</b> between the Republican leadership of Indianapolis, and the Democratic leadership of the state. The refusal by the city police to battle the strikers was met with approval by Mayor of Indianapolis, Republican Samuel Shank. Shank informed Governor Samuel Ralston that the strike was growing beyond what he could control and insisted the Governor should take responsibility {{for dealing with the}} situation. Shank asked Ralston to call a special session of the Indiana General Assembly to end the strike through a compulsory arbitration law, but Ralston refused because he thought it unlikely that the General Assembly could agree to such legislation in a timely manner. Ralston believed Shank was undermining the police effort and told him to order the city police back into action, but Shank refused. Ralston then bypassed the mayor and requested that County Sheriff, Democrat Theodore Porttens, bring in county police to reestablish order.|$|E

Tentative plans were already being developed for the second Glasnost Bowl, between Miami and Penn State. Illinois baseball coach Augie Garrido suggested creating a two-sport doubleheader with both universities' baseball teams preceding the game.|$|E
500|$|Civil service {{reform was}} a {{prominent}} issue following Harrison's election. Harrison had campaigned as {{a supporter of the}} merit system, as opposed to the spoils system. Although some of the civil service had been classified under the Pendleton Act by previous administrations, Harrison spent much of his first months in office deciding on political appointments. Congress was widely divided on the issue and Harrison was reluctant to address the issue in hope of preventing the alienation of either side. The issue became a <b>political</b> <b>football</b> of the time and was immortalized in a cartoon captioned [...] "What can I do when both parties insist on kicking?" [...] Harrison appointed Theodore Roosevelt and Hugh Smith Thompson, both reformers, to the Civil Service Commission, but otherwise did little to further the reform cause.|$|E

500|$|Walker {{published}} International Bimetallism in 1896 roundly critiquing the demonetization {{of silver}} out of political {{pressure and the}} impact of this change on prices and profits as well as worker employment and wages. Walker's reputation and position on the issue isolated him among public figures and made him a target in the press. The book was published {{in the midst of the}} 1896 presidential election pitting populist [...] "silver" [...] candidate William Jennings Bryan against the capitalist [...] "gold" [...] candidate William McKinley and the competing interpretations of the nation's leading economist's stance on the issue became a <b>political</b> <b>football</b> during the campaign. The presidential candidate and economist were not close allies as Walker advocated a double standard by all leading financial nations while Bryan argued for the United States' unilateral shift to a silver standard. The rift was heightened by the east-west divide on the issue as well as Walker's general distaste for political populism; Walker's position was supported by conservative bankers and statesmen like Henry Lee Higginson, George F. Hoar, John M. Forbes, and Henry Cabot Lodge.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the contested}} 1995 {{election}} {{for the presidency}} of the AFL-CIO, the OI became a <b>political</b> <b>football.</b> [...] SEIU president John Sweeney criticized the Kirkland administration for failing to boost union organizing, and pointed to the small budget and lack of focus on the OI as one example. [...] Sweeney promised to dramatically boost the OI's funding and importance. [...] For his part, Lane Kirkland pointed to the establishment of the OI as a major success of his administration. [...] Kirkland later abandoned the race and resigned as president of the federation. His successor and presidential candidate, Thomas Donahue, was able to lay a stronger claim on organizing success because of his role as the primary backer of the OI in 1989. But Donahue's claims were rejected by AFL-CIO member unions, and Sweeney won the presidential race.|$|E

At a press conferences days after the failed Christmas Day bomb attack on Northwest Airlines Flight 253 by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, Brennan said U.S. intelligence agencies did not miss any signs that could have prevented the attempt but later said he had let the President down by underestimating a small group of Yemeni terrorists and not connecting them to the attempted bomber. Within two weeks after the incident, however, he produced a report highly critical of the performance of U.S. intelligence agencies, concluding that their focus on terrorist attempts aimed at U.S. soil was inadequate. In February 2010, he claimed on Meet the Press that he was tired of Republican lawmakers using national security issues as <b>political</b> <b>footballs,</b> and making allegations where they did not know the facts.|$|R

2500|$|Today, {{the tension}} between {{preservation}} and development {{is seen in the}} Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) drilling controversy. The question of whether to allow drilling for oil in ANWR has been a <b>political</b> <b>football</b> for every sitting American president since Jimmy Carter. Studies performed by the US Geological Survey have shown that the [...] "1002 area" [...] of ANWR, located just east of Prudhoe Bay, contains large deposits of crude oil. Traditionally, Alaskan residents, trade unions, and business interests have supported drilling in the refuge, while environmental groups and many within the Democratic Party have traditionally opposed it. Among native Alaskan tribes, support is mixed. In the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, votes about the status of the refuge occurred repeatedly in the U.S. House and Senate, but as of 2007 efforts to allow drilling have always been ultimately thwarted by filibusters, amendments, or vetoes.|$|E

The icon's melancholy orbit is reflected in the various characters' ellipses and near-misses as they career vertiginously through all kinds of space, be it physical, political, emotional or metaphysical.

50|$|On {{its release}} The Football Factory was heralded as a ‚Äòstate of the nation‚Äô novel by some reviewers, while others criticised its aversion to <b>political</b> correctness. <b>Football</b> {{fans and the}} wider public made it a best-seller.

5000|$|By {{the middle}} of the 2nd century BC, the Plebeians (commoners) saw a {{worsening}} economic situation. The long military campaigns, in particular those of the Punic Wars, had forced citizens to leave their farms, which often caused those farms to fall into a state of disrepair. This situation was made worse during the Second Punic War, when Hannibal fought the Romans throughout Italy, and the Romans adopted a strategy of attrition and guerilla warfare in response. When the soldiers returned from the battlefield, they often had to sell their farms to pay their debts, and the landed aristocracy quickly bought these farms at discounted prices. The wars had also brought to Rome a great surplus of inexpensive slave labor, which the landed aristocrats used to staff their new farms. Soon the masses of unemployed Plebeians began to flood into Rome, and into the ranks of the legislative assemblies. At the same time, the aristocracy was becoming extremely rich, and with the destruction of Rome's great commercial rival of Carthage, even more opportunities for profit became available. While the aristocrats spent their time exploiting new opportunities for profit, Rome was conquering new civilizations in the east. These civilizations were often highly developed, and as such they opened up a world of luxury to the Romans. As both wealth and eastern luxuries became available to aristocratic Romans, they began to enter the [...] "international" [...] Mediterranean arena in collection of art, sponsorship of literary works, and cultural acquisition and development generally; some Romans saw the changes with alarm. The sums that were spent on the new luxuries had no precedent in prior Roman history; the Romans began to pass sumptuary laws to limit some excesses, although these were harmless at best, <b>political</b> <b>footballs</b> at worst.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} that the EU can curtail the autonomy of FIFA and UEFA by building upon insights from Principal-Agent theory. It explores and explains the EU‚Äôs control over these organisations by mapping the actors and instruments that define EU control of FIFA and UEFA and discussing their activation and mitigation. In this light, it introduces a new perspective (exogenous control) and instrument (steering). Whether or not the EU deploys the control instruments at its disposal is defined by a constant interplay between FIFA and UEFA, their <b>political</b> and <b>football</b> principals and their EU supervisors. Activating and mitigating control within this triangular set-up will dictate whether or not FIFA and UEFA can expect their autonomy to be curtailed if and when they break from good governance practices. status: publishe...|$|R

He was further able to show that similar events occurring in a variety of different types of crowd disorder were regarded very differently by the courts and were the subject of major discrepancies in sentencing.|$|R
