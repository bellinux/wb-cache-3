Due to increased demand, high product variety, and a <b>push</b> <b>production</b> <b>system,</b> the plant has suffered from excessive wastes, unorganized workstations, and unhealthy work environment. This has translated into increased production cost, frequent delays, and low workers morale. Under such conditions, it has become difficult, if not impossible, to implement effective continuous improvement studies. Hence, the lean project is aimed at diagnosing the production process, streamlining the workflow, removing/reducing process waste, cleaning the production environment, improving plant layout, and organizing workstations. 5 S lean technology is utilized for achieving project objectives. The work {{was a combination of}} both culture changes and tangible/physical changes on the shop floor. The project has drastically changed the plant and developed the infrastructure for a successful implementation of continuous improvement as well as other best practices and quality initiatives...|$|E

The forecasts are essential, especially for companies working with a <b>push</b> <b>production</b> <b>system,</b> {{for which there is}} no sale of collateral. They should therefore plan their production and financial systems with the aim of meeting the demand forecast of their products or services. Thus, this study was conducted at a meat agribusiness located in Chapecó, in the state of Santa Catarina, in order to analyze the demand forecasting methods used by the company. It is a case study with a qualitative approach. Data collection was conducted through semi-structured interviews with the operations manager, commercial manager and analysts who respond to the demand forecasts made. The main results highlight the use of both quantitative and qualitative methods, as well as indicating the importance of demand forecasts for the planning of the compan...|$|E

In this work, causes of high WIP were identified and three approaches were developed to reduce and control better the WIP. We propose to split the production line into dedicated lines, to change the <b>push</b> <b>production</b> <b>system</b> to a pull production system, and to align the process times to the takt time. A simulation model of the proposed production line was analyzed and was verified by a simulation model of the current production line. Three configurations were tested for production line A and production line B. We found that the proposed production line reduced the WIP by 70 % and saved $ 990, 000 annually in {{inventory holding}} costs. In addition, the lead time was reduced from 6. 4 days to 1. 9 days and the strain on the warehouse capacity was eliminated. by Kevan Yong Cai Chim. Thesis (M. Eng.)

40|$|The pull {{multi-stage}} {{production scheduling}} and inventory control {{system is a}} way of implementing the just-in-time doctrine. In the pull <b>system</b> the <b>production</b> schedule of the final stage is transmitted back to all the upstream stages. This is achieved by keeping a certain amount of parts at each stage, with succeeding stages withdrawing parts from preceding ones {{only to the extent that}} they are needed;A stochastic model for the pull multi-stage <b>production</b> <b>system</b> is developed for two situations. The first situation is that a single machine (server) with non-zero inventory. The second situation is that of several machines with zero inventory;The model is studied and analyzed in the light of several measures of system performance and effectiveness. Allocation of parts among stages, and the effect of processing rates are investigated;A stochastic model for the <b>push</b> multi-stage <b>production</b> <b>system</b> is also developed and compared to the pull model. A new method, which reduced the number of Markovian states, is developed to model the blocking phenomenon in push system. A duality phenomenon between the pull and a specially defined push model is presented and discussed;The confluent system, with 2 ̆ 2 made 2 ̆ 2 parts processed in house into subassemblies, and then into final assemblies, is also modeled under the pull system. WIP allocation is studied as for the series system, and the possibility is explored of analyzing a process through its 2 ̆ 2 sub-process 2 ̆ 2;Although processing and demand are assumed exponential, the limitation imposed by stage capacity will cause the output process not to be poisson.

40|$|Production {{systems such}} as the CONWIP (constant work-in-process) pull {{production}} system have been widely studied by researchers to date. The CONWIP pull production system is an alternative to pure push and pure pull systems that lowers and controls inventory levels and reduces production lead time. In this study, a CONWIP pull production system was simulated {{in place of the}} current <b>push</b> <b>production</b> <b>system</b> at a food packaging company. ARENA 12. 0 simulation software was used and a production system with two dedicated production lines was proposed to reduce the current system's complexity. A method for obtaining the optimum CONWIP level was determined. Various advantages of the CONWIP pull production system were analyzed and it was found that besides a reduction in planning complexity, the proposed two dedicated lines with CONWIP pull production system can also help the company to greatly reduce their total WIP and achieve inventory holding costs savings of over S$ 38, 000 per month. In addition, the total customer lead time can also be reduced from 12 days to 10 days while still meeting customer demand. by Jean Jingying Liu. Thesis (M. Eng.)

40|$|A low {{inventory}} {{with high}} availability {{is the primary}} objective for make-to-stock production plants. Thus, production plants must choose between two approaches, a <b>push</b> <b>production</b> <b>system</b> or a pull production system. Despite {{the simplicity of the}} pull system, and numerous reports of successful implementation, the push system remains prevalent. Interviews with local managers reveal two obstacles to implementing pull systems: (1) lack of a precise definition for pull systems, and a general ignorance among managers regarding the concept of pull systems. As a result, some managers may believe they are running a pull system when they are actually using a push system; (2) lack of confidence in the ability of a pull system to handle significant demand variability. This study designs a make-to-stock production plant game to enable managers to determine whether: (1) they are using a push or a pull system; and (2) a pull system is superior to a push system, even under significant demand variability. The results support our belief that most participating managers still use a push system, and demonstrate that a pull system is superior. We anticipate that {{the results of this study}} will increase the willingness of make-to-stock companies and make-to-order companies (especially fashion product manufacturers) to re-examine the potential benefits of implementing a pull system, and encourage them to assess whether such a move is suitable...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} possible reasons for long lead-time in a customer driven production, and how the lead-time can be reduced. To fulfil the purpose the study has been broken down into two questions. 1. Whichfactorsaffectthelead-timeinacustomer-drivenproduction? 2. How to reduce the lead-time in a customer-driven production? Methodology – A literature review and a case study has been conducted to fulfil the purpose. The case study is conducted at JELD-WEN AB in Forserum. The empirical data have been collected by observations, interviews and by document studies. A Value Stream Map has also been used as a method to show the present state. By analysing collected empirical data with the theoretical framework the findings of the study was generated. Findings – The study identified four factors that cause long lead-time. These are: planning and steering, <b>push</b> <b>production</b> <b>system,</b> lot sizing and priority rule. All of these individual factors have in common that they all lead to an identified main factor, Work in progress (WIP). According to Little ́s law a high level of WIP results in a increased lead-time. To reduce the lead-time it is important to take control of the level of WIP. It is possible to control the level of work in progress by using a pull-system with generic kanban. Further, the production system should be synchronized with identified bottleneck to create a smoother flow. The level of WIP is also affected by the size of the production batch and should therefore also be considered and adjusted accordingly. To avoid the risk of sub-optimizing the production flow, it is important to consider how each resource or section are optimizing, and how their priorities were made. Implications – By implementing the recommendations of the authors, the level of WIP can be controlled. By providing the decision making process with the right information based on accurate data, the correct effect can be achieved. Limitations - Limitations of the study are covered by the fact that only one case company was investigated. Because of that, it is difficult to draw general conclusions from the results obtained in the study. The study is also limited in that the possible factors identified to affect the lead-time are not exclusive, other factors may have been left out. Key Words – Customer-driven production, Work in progress, Lead-time reduction. ...|$|E
40|$|According to Wortmann classification, the Building Industry (BI) can {{be defined}} as engineer-to-order (ETO) industry: the engineering-process starts only when an order is acquired. This {{definition}} implies that every final product (building) is almost unique, and processes cannot be easily standardized or automated. For this reason, the Building Industry is one of the less efficient industries today, and the productivity gap with other industries is growing faster. Since the 1940 s, prefabrication and standardization of entire buildings or of complex components are effective strategies to push BI from an ETO industry towards an assembly-to-order industry (ATO). Although, prefabrication and standardization strategies provide effective solutions to improve process efficiency, they are not widespread adopted. The reason for this poor success can be identified in limits of customization that afflicts prefabricated and standardized products, which do not satisfy completely the needs usually delivered by customers. This paper presents a research activity aiming at enhancing Mass-Customization capabilities in the BI through Parametric and Generative design techniques in frontend activities of the value-chain system. Referring to a case study for Glued-Laminated Timber (GLT) products, a parametric algorithm has been programmed in order to satisfy two specific design intents: reducing the usage of unneeded high-quality raw material in final products and facilitating the manufacturing process of complex products, such as doubled-curved ones. Crossing capabilities of the parametric algorithm in Digital Fabrication strategies and capabilities of a standard <b>production</b> <b>system</b> of GLT, authors discuss whether Parametric and Generative Design techniques may enhance Mass-Customization capabilities in the BI, <b>pushing</b> the whole <b>production</b> <b>system</b> towards more efficient processes...|$|R

An attempt is made here to summarize the information on rice <b>production</b> <b>systems,</b> resources used, crop productivity attained, the challenges encountered, and possible research needs for improving productivity in rice <b>production</b> <b>systems,</b> to meet the future food demands. Based on the major methods of rice establishment of the world, the rice <b>production</b> <b>systems</b> are categorized as (a) transplanted rice (TPR) <b>production</b> <b>systems</b> and (b) direct-seeded rice (DSR) <b>production</b> <b>systems.</b> DSR <b>production</b> <b>systems</b> are further categorized as (i) dry-seeded rice (dry-DSR) <b>production</b> <b>system,</b> (ii) wet-seeded rice (wet-DSR) <b>production</b> <b>system,</b> and (iii) water-seeded rice (water-DSR) <b>production</b> <b>system.</b> The productivity of TPR and DSR {{was reported to be}} similar when the best management practices are adopted.

40|$|Manufacturing {{companies}} are increasingly required {{to deal with}} and introduce significant changes in their <b>production</b> <b>systems</b> to gain a competitive advantage. The <b>production</b> <b>system</b> design process is widely considered a means of introducing such changes, and decisions made during design are viewed as critical to its characterization and performance. However, this presents a problem because committing to decisions that involve significant changes implies not only dealing with requirements, products, challenges, or expectations that are different from what currently exists, but also addressing uncertainties regarding both the information necessary for committing to a <b>production</b> <b>system</b> design decision and the actual benefits {{that can be achieved}} {{as a result of these}} changes. One way to support the <b>production</b> <b>system</b> design decisions in this context is through the use of Discrete Event Simulation (DES). However, understanding of DES use when supporting <b>production</b> <b>system</b> design decisions in this domain remains limited.      Therefore, the objective of this thesis is to explore the use of DES in support of <b>production</b> <b>system</b> design decisions when significant changes are introduced. Data are collected through a multiple case study method and DES from three real-time <b>production</b> <b>system</b> design projects at one manufacturing company. All <b>production</b> <b>system</b> design projects studied involved the introduction of significant <b>production</b> <b>system</b> changes for which limited experience existed. The cases and results are presented in three appended publications. The findings establish the purpose of DES use when supporting <b>production</b> <b>system</b> design decisions in this context. To this end three groups of DES model objectives are identified: communicating decisions and visualizing results, evaluating a <b>production</b> <b>system</b> design concept focused on operational performance, and experimenting with what-if scenarios while predicting <b>production</b> <b>system</b> outputs. The points of DES use when supporting <b>production</b> <b>system</b> design decisions are specified in relation to current theoretical understanding of a <b>production</b> <b>system</b> design process. Then, challenges and contributions of DES use supporting <b>production</b> <b>system</b> design decisions are identified. A framework is presented to facilitate the use of DES supporting <b>production</b> <b>system</b> design decisions when significant changes are introduced. The framework is based on the identification of high-level strategic objectives and relates these to <b>production</b> <b>system</b> design decisions. It defines DES use in support of these decisions and establishes milestones for DES use during <b>production</b> <b>system</b> design. Based on an analysis of the challenges and contributions of DES use, the framework helps formulate the purpose of DES use to achieve <b>production</b> <b>system</b> design decision support. ...|$|R

40|$|To compete, {{manufacturing}} companies need <b>production</b> <b>systems</b> that quickly {{can respond to}} changes. To handle change drivers such as volume variations or new product variants, reconfigurability is advocated as a competitive means. This implies an ability to add, remove, and/or rearrange {{the structure of the}} <b>production</b> <b>system</b> to be ready for future changes. Still, {{it is not clear how}} the <b>production</b> <b>system</b> design process can capture and support the design of reconfigurable <b>production</b> <b>systems.</b> Therefore, the objective of this thesis is to increase the knowledge of how to support the design of reconfigurable <b>production</b> <b>systems.</b> Reconfigurability could be defined by a number of reconfigurability characteristics including convertibility, scalability, automatibility, mobility, modularity, integrability, and diagnosability. In eight case studies, reconfigurability characteristics in <b>production</b> <b>system</b> design were studied in order to investigate reconfigurability needs, knowledge, and practice in {{manufacturing companies}}. In three of the case studies reconfigurable <b>production</b> <b>systems</b> were studied to identify the links between change drivers and reconfigurability characteristics. In the remaining five case studies, reconfigurability in the <b>production</b> <b>system</b> design processes was addressed in terms of needs, prerequisites, and consideration. Based on the literature review and the case studies, support for reconfigurable <b>production</b> <b>system</b> design is suggested including two parts. The first part comprises support for analyzing the need for reconfigurability. Based on relevant change drivers the need for reconfigurability must be identified to enable selection of right type and degree of reconfigurability for each specific case of application. A comprehensive view of the reconfigurability characteristics is presented and links between change drivers and reconfigurability characteristics are described. The characteristics are divided into critical characteristics, that lead to a capacity or functionality change of the <b>production</b> <b>system,</b> and supporting characteristics, that reduce system reconfiguration time but do not necessarily lead to a modification of functionality or capacity of the <b>production</b> <b>system.</b> The second part provides support in how to consider reconfigurability in the <b>production</b> <b>system</b> design process. A holistic perspective is crucial to design reconfigurable <b>production</b> <b>systems</b> and therefore constituent parts of a <b>production</b> <b>system</b> are described.

This indicates that the additive genetic effects differ in organic and conventional <b>production</b> <b>systems.</b> The specific combining abilities (SCA) were significant for grain yield and plant height, indicating {{a significant difference between}} the non-additive effects. However, the SCA x <b>production</b> <b>systems</b> interactions were not significant for those traits. It was concluded that for the development of maize cultivars for the organic <b>production</b> <b>system,</b> selection must be made in the specific environment for the expression of favorable alleles that confer advantages for adapting to this system; the general combining ability of genitors is different for the two <b>production</b> <b>systems,</b> but the specific combining ability isn’t different in organic and conventional systems.
