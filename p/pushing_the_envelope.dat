500|$|Distancing {{the film}} from what {{producer}} Preston Stutzman called the [...] "candy-coated, brightly colored pastel world" [...] of other CG animated films, an {{attempt was made}} to bring an organic look to the film, and dirt was rubbed into the colors. The Nightmare Before Christmas was cited as an inspiration for the filmmakers to try to bend the characters' shapes into extremes, and many other choices unconventional to computer-animated films were also made. For example, one of the Woodsman's eyes was made bigger than the other, and Red was given only four fingers, so as to make her look more like a doll. Producer Katie Hooten explained that [...] "CG in the past has been <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> <b>envelope</b> to make things look more realistic, but Hoodwinked takes things back to where CG looks a lot more like a cartoon." ...|$|E

So <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> <b>envelope</b> for us {{will be in the}} sexual nature". This is evidenced by the episode's opening, a [...] "sexy" [...] look at the character Quake getting dressed. Executive producer Jeph Loeb added, [...] "what it does is give us the chance to tell different stories. The idea is some of the material might be more mature, there may be more grit, what we're doing might be darker. It certainly made a lot more sense when we wanted to introduce a character like Ghost Rider into this world." ...|$|E

500|$|Distressed from a {{long stretch}} of poor ratings, NBC {{executives}} placed pressure on Homicide: Life on the Street producers to improve its viewership and become more popular than its higher-rated time-slot competitor, Nash Bridges. Yoshimura and the other producers, however, decided to continue <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> <b>envelope</b> with [...] "Subway" [...] because they felt the series needed to maintain its quality and survive. [...] "Subway" [...] had to be greenlighted by NBC before a script could be written, and Yoshimura anticipated backlash about the episode. He said, [...] "Every episode, we have trouble with NBC, so this is no different. We've fought that battle, we've had five years of that, so it doesn't matter to us." [...] However, the executives were surprisingly enthusiastic about the premise. Warren Littlefield, then-president of NBC Entertainment, said his first reaction was [...] "the classic response of a network programmer: 'Oh my God, this is scary, but that he quickly came around to the idea and greenlighted the project.|$|E

The band has spent {{the middle of the}} year in Los Angeles recording 18 new tracks including an acoustic EP. With a career spanning nearly 20 years and selling over half a million records Andrew Schwab feels this album is a special landmark for P86. He says, [...] "We have loved <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> <b>envelope</b> of evolution on every Project 86 release and this record is no exception.

500|$|FLCL has {{received}} highly positive reviews from critics.

Robert Nelson of T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews gave the anime 4 out of 5 stars stating, [...] "FLCL {{may not have a}} straightforward or deep plot. It may not have complex characterizations. Hell, it may not have any meaning. But FLCL does succeed in its true objective. It is fun to watch!" [...] Chris Beveridge of Mania gave it an A- stating, [...] "FLCL is something that allowed those involved to try a wide variety of styles and techniques and does come off as quite experimental. But nearly everything worked in their favor and you end up with three hours of nearly break neck speed action, comedy and commentary on modern life." [...] Brian Ruh praised the series stating, [...] "It was very frenetic and kept <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> <b>envelope</b> on what was possible in Japanese animation." ...|$|E

500|$|Helmsley {{was being}} {{highlighted}} again in 1997, winning the 1997 King of the Ring tournament by defeating Mankind in the finals. Later that year, Shawn Michaels, Helmsley, Chyna and Rick Rude formed D-Generation X (DX). This stable became known for <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> <b>envelope,</b> as Michaels and Helmsley made risqué promos – using the catchphrase [...] "Suck It" [...] and a [...] "crotch chop" [...] hand motion, – and sarcastically derided Bret Hart and Canada. By that point, Helmsley had fully dropped the [...] "blueblood snob" [...] gimmick, appearing in T-shirts and leather jackets. During this period, his ring name was shortened to simply Triple H, {{even though he}} would still be referred for a while as Helmsley {{from time to time}} and Hunter for the rest of his career. Even after the DX versus Hart Foundation storyline ended, he continued to feud with the sole remaining Hart family member Owen over the European Championship. This ended in a match between the two at WrestleMania XIV, with the stipulation that Chyna had to be handcuffed to then-Commissioner Sgt. Slaughter. Triple H won after Chyna threw powder into Slaughter's eyes, momentarily [...] "blinding" [...] him and allowing her to interfere in the match.|$|E

Entertainment Weeklys Ken Tucker wrote that [...] "Stankonia reeks of artful ambition rendered with impeccable skill" [...] and described OutKast as [...] "endlessly good-humored and imaginative even {{when dealing with}} the most grim and mind-deadening facets of ghetto life." [...] Yahoo! Music's Soren Baker commented that [...] "Dre and Big Boi again reinvent themselves, this time as Parliament-inspired musicians who specialize on male-female relationships, boasting, and out-there lyrics." [...] Baker concluded in his review, [...] "With another nearly flawless album, OutKast arguably solidifies their {{reputation as one of}} the best hip-hop groups of all time." [...] The Los Angeles Times opined that [...] "the record's most interesting moments are gorgeous Prince-style soul." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote that [...] "OutKast's music savors the viscous propulsion of funk, with raps and tunes that never ignore the body and its instinctive desires ... Yet OutKast -- taking cues from a band it obviously reveres, Parliament-Funkadelic -- never forgets that bodies are attached to minds." [...] URB called the album [...] "a complex tome that enmeshes contemporary hip-hop values with a timeless Southern soul, while <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> <b>envelope</b> damn near off the table." [...] Mojo called it [...] "hip hop with the power to convert even the most reactionary nonbelievers." ...|$|E
500|$|In a less {{enthusiastic}} review, Time Out Sydney {{felt that}} the album is unfortunately Brian Eno's new album rather than U2's: [...] "for all that's new, there's no way that you'll mistake it for another band." [...] Pitchfork Media reviewer Ryan Dombal gave a score of 4.2 out of 10, stating, [...] "the album's ballyhooed experimentation is either terribly misguided or hidden underneath a wash of shameless U2-isms." [...] Kaj Roth of Melodic magazine described it as [...] "more electronic and less rock" [...] and stating {{that part of the}} album [...] "reminds just too much of their early 90's records". Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun gave a rating of three and a half stars, comparing it to the 1990s albums Zooropa, Pop, and Original Soundtracks 1 while stating [...] "This is no blockbuster... It's the least immediate U2 album in years, but one that diehard fans will enjoy living with". Madeleine Chong of MTV Asia wrote that, [...] "Although U2 should be lauded for their efforts at constant reinvention and <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> <b>envelope</b> in the rock genre, [...] possesses neither the iconic qualities of The Joshua Tree or the radical yet relevant magnetism of Achtung Baby." [...] Toronto Star music critic Ben Rayner called the songs boring, adding that the ambience introduced by Eno and Lanois was [...] "often all these vague, hook-deficient songs have going for them." [...] Rob Harvilla of The Village Voice gave the album a mixed review and wrote that its songs [...] "will remind you of other, much better songs, but in a way that only makes you want to go and listen to those other songs instead." [...] Time magazine also gave it an unfavourable review, calling the effort [...] "unsatisfied" [...] and [...] "mostly restless, tentative and confused." ...|$|E

500|$|Early {{before the}} release of B'Day in 2006, Knowles held a {{nationwide}} audition for female musicians which ended in Sony Music Studios {{where she and her}} father and collaborator Mathew Knowles were among the judges. The auditions searched for keyboard players, bassists, guitarists, horn players, percussionists and drummers with stops in New Jersey, Atlanta, Burbank, Chicago and Houston. The musicians were asked to re-create the performance of [...] "Work It Out" [...] from the live album Live at Wembley (2004) and be able to perform at least a one-minute solo. Knowles stated that her goal was to get together a group of [...] "fierce, talented, hungry, beautiful" [...] women and form an all-female band. Speaking about her tour and the decision to form a band, Knowles said, [...] "I'm all about female empowerment. I'm all about <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> <b>envelope.</b> I know it's my responsibility to do something different. I said, 'I want a band, I want something different.'" [...] She further described the process of choosing the contestants during an interview, saying: [...] "I had worldwide auditions; people flew in from Atlanta, Houston, Israel, all over the world. It was extremely difficult [...] [...] so many talented women. I wanted only a nine-piece band, but the girls were so amazing, I couldn't decide. I think I'm going to wind up having 12 people so I have two [...] certain instruments, because [...] were just brilliant. It's a thing called star quality, it's a thing you can't put your finger on, can't describe. When they were playing, I said, 'I want to see y'all battle.' I brought in two of every instrument and that's how I chose. You see the one that really wants it. It was so entertaining, the energy, seeing the girls battle ... God, it was the best. It was magical." [...] Between segments of the show, Suga Mama performed periodic instrumental interludes, with every member giving a solo so Knowles could change her costumes seven times. Describing them as [...] "fantastic", Eamon Sweeney of the Irish Independent noted that [...] "the interval music works perfectly... but two excruciating drum solos are absolutely unnecessary".|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{version of the}} tour was acclaimed by critics. Jane Stevenson from Toronto Sun gave the concert {{four out of five}} stars and said that Lady Gaga came across as a [...] "confident, colourful, and campy performer. [...] Gaga's success was evident with slick-looking videos, lights, elaborate costumes, dancers, and yes, a band, even if her stage was sometimes left dark as she left to make numerous changes." [...] T'Cha Dunlevy for The Gazette noted that the performance was lacking—adding that the show never reached its peak until the end, when Gaga performed the [...] "real rendition" [...] of [...] "Poker Face" [...] and [...] "Bad Romance." [...] "Better late than never", Dunlevy concluded. Aedan Helmer from Jam! magazine said that [...] "At first blush, it might seem the real driving force behind Gaga's meteoric rise to fame is her hand-picked cadre of costume and set designers—dubbed Haus of Gaga—who seemingly know no bounds when it comes to <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> <b>envelope</b> of haute couture and the theatre of the absurd. [...] But what really sets Gaga apart from the middling masses of lip-synching Britney clones and Idol wannabes is her pure, unadulterated musical talent. [...] The Lady can sing." [...] Theatre critic Kelly Nestruck, while writing for The Guardian, said [...] "While The Monster Ball has nothing on the great operas or the golden age of musical theatre, Lady Gaga's 'electro-pop opera' is at least twice as entertaining and infinitely fresher than any stage musical written over the last decade." [...] Lauren Carter from Boston Herald praised the show saying [...] " [...] only has two albums under her belt but who cares? Every song feels like a hit, and Gaga-as-star is already taking on Madonna-like proportions. [...] After [...] at the Wang Theater, fans could justifiably walk away thinking Lady Gaga is crazy, brilliant or both." [...] Jeremy Adams from Rolling Stone reviewed the performance at Wang Center in Boston and said that [...] "Throughout the evening, Gaga [...] aimed for a kind of pop theatricality that might potentially cement her burgeoning status as performance artist." ...|$|E
