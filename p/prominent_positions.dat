5|$|Jagielski {{was born}} to a peasant family on 12 January 1924, in Kołomyja, Poland (Second Polish Republic) (now Kolomyia, Ukraine). He spent the Second World War as an {{agricultural}} laborer on the farm of his parents. After the war he finished studies at the Main School of Planning and Statistics {{as well as in}} the Instytut Kształcenia Kadr Naukowych (Institute of Preparing Science Cadres), the latter being a graduate school preparing people for <b>prominent</b> <b>positions</b> in the Polish communist party structures.|$|E
5|$|Keating reaped {{benefits}} from the move to Arizona, a wide-open territory in both a physical and business sense that allowed someone a fresh start. He turned the now-renamed American Continental Corporation around, adding various operations and divisions in a structure somewhat reminiscent of American Financial. As chairman and controlling stockholder, Keating relied heavily upon family members, employing his son and four of his sons-in-law in <b>prominent</b> <b>positions.</b> Charles Keating III had a fast career rise within the company.|$|E
5|$|Three men born in or {{near the}} village of Farnworth {{achieved}} <b>prominent</b> <b>positions</b> in the Anglican church.

40|$|In this paper, I {{examine the}} {{metrical}} dependency of tone placement in OT. In Creek and Shingazidja, {{the determination of}} tone placement heavily draws on the special relationship between high tone and the metrically <b>prominent</b> <b>position</b> in the prosodic domain. In Shingazidja the metrically <b>prominent</b> <b>position</b> in the metrical phrase is tonally marked by high tone whereas the metrically <b>prominent</b> <b>position</b> in the prosodic word is tonally marked by high tone in Creek. In determining the metrically <b>prominent</b> <b>position,</b> the prosody of intonational phrase is metrically computed in Shingazidja whereas the prosody of prosodic word is metrically computed in Creek. In the metrical phrase in Shingazidja, the metrically <b>prominent</b> <b>position</b> is occupied by the rightmost vowel of the leftmost foot whereas the metrically <b>prominent</b> <b>position</b> is occupied by the rightmost vowel of the rightmost foot in the prosodic word in Creek. The ranking relationship of conflicting constraints formalizes the factors affecting the placement of high tone {{and the construction of}} metrical structure, and the parametric difference in the ranking relationship differentiates Shingazidja tonology from Creek tonology.

5|$|In Lenin's absence, Stalin {{had begun}} {{consolidating}} his power both by appointing his supporters to <b>prominent</b> <b>positions,</b> and by cultivating {{an image of}} himself as Lenin's closest intimate and deserving successor. In December 1922, Stalin took responsibility for Lenin's regimen, being tasked by the Politburo with controlling who had access to him. Lenin was increasingly critical of Stalin; while Lenin was insisting that the state should retain its monopoly on international trade during mid-1922, Stalin was leading other Bolsheviks in unsuccessfully opposing this. There were personal arguments between the two as well; Stalin had upset Krupskaya by shouting at her during a phone conversation, which in turn greatly angered Lenin, who sent Stalin a letter expressing his annoyance.|$|E
5|$|After al-Adil I {{seized the}} throne in Cairo {{and with it}} the sultanate of the Ayyubid oligarchy, the period of rivalry between Damascus and Cairo to become capital of the Ayyubid empire commenced. Under al-Adil and al-Kamil, Damascus {{continued}} as an autonomous province whose ruler reserved the right to designate his own heir, but during as-Salih Ayyub's rule, military campaigns against Syria reduced Damascus to a vassal of Cairo. In addition, Ayyub established new rules both in administration and government in order to centralize his regime; he conferred the most <b>prominent</b> <b>positions</b> of the state to his close confidants, instead of his Ayyubid relatives. His wife Shajar al-Durr, for example, managed the affairs of Egypt while he was in Syria. Ayyub officially delegated his authority to his dead son Khalil and made al-Durr act formally on Khalil's behalf.|$|E
5|$|The {{contact between}} South India and Islam {{goes back to}} the 7th century, when trade between Hindu kingdoms and Islamic caliphates thrived. These Muslim traders settled on the Malabar Coast and married local Hindu women, and their {{descendants}} {{came to be known as}} Mappillas. By the 14th century, Muslims had become a significant minority in the south, though the advent of Portuguese missionaries checked their growth. Haider Ali, though a devout Muslim, did not allow his faith to interfere with the administration of the predominantly Hindu kingdom. Historians are, however, divided on the intentions of Haider Ali's son, Tipu Sultan. It has been claimed that Tipu raised Hindus to <b>prominent</b> <b>positions</b> in his administration, made generous grants to Hindu temples and brahmins, and generally respected other faiths, and that any religious conversions that Tipu undertook were as punishment to those who rebelled against his authority. However, this has been countered by other historians who claim that Tipu Sultan treated the non-Muslims of Mysore far better than those of the Malabar, Raichur and Kodagu regions. They opine that Tipu was responsible for mass conversions of Christians and Hindus in these regions, either by force or by offering them tax incentives and revenue benefits to convert.|$|E

25|$|The Sephardim have {{distinguished}} {{themselves as}} physicians and statesmen, and {{have won the}} favor of rulers and princes, in both the Christian and the Islamic world. That the Sephardim were selected for <b>prominent</b> <b>positions</b> in every country where they settled was only {{in part due to}} the fact that Spanish had become a world-language through the expansion of Spain into the world spanning Spanish Empire—the cosmopolitan cultural background after long associations with Islamic scholars of the Sephardic families also made them extremely well educated for the times, even well into the European Enlightenment.|$|E
