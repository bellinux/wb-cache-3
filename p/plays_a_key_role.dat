5|$|Acting also <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>role</b> in Szabó’s films, as he values {{psychological}} {{complexity in}} his central characters. In his first several features, {{he tended to}} use the same lead actors over and over—first András Bálint, then Klaus Maria Brandauer. Consistent with this focus on acting, he frequently employs long close-up shots to emphasize the play of emotions on the faces of his characters.|$|E

5|$|By {{means of}} the sodium-potassium pump, living human cells pump three sodium ions out of the cell in {{exchange}} for two potassium ions pumped in; comparing ion concentrations across the cell membrane, inside to outside, potassium measures about 40:1, and sodium, about 1:10. In nerve cells, the electrical charge across the cell membrane enables transmission of the nerve impulse—an action potential—when the charge is dissipated; sodium <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>role</b> in that activity.|$|E
5|$|Individual {{components}} of the 19S particle have their own regulatory roles. Gankyrin, a recently identified oncoprotein, {{is one of the}} 19S subcomponents that also tightly binds the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK4 and <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>role</b> in recognizing ubiquitinated p53, via its affinity for the ubiquitin ligase MDM2. Gankyrin is anti-apoptotic and {{has been shown to be}} overexpressed in some tumor cell types such as hepatocellular carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|The hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>role</b> in {{maintaining}} thyroid hormone levels within normal limits. Production of TSH by the anterior pituitary gland is stimulated in turn by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), {{released from the}} hypothalamus. Production of TSH and TRH is decreased by thyroxine by a negative feedback process. Not enough TRH, which is uncommon, can lead to not enough TSH and thereby to not enough thyroid hormone production.|$|E

He reinstates Kamsa's father, Ugrasena, as {{the king of the}} Yadavas and becomes a leading prince at the court. During this period, he becomes a friend of Arjuna and the other Pandava princes of the Kuru kingdom. Krishna <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>role</b> in the Mahabharata. After the war is over, he leads his Yadava subjects to the city of Dwaraka (in modern Gujarat).|$|E
5|$|RNA is {{transcribed}} {{with only}} four bases (adenine, cytosine, guanine and uracil), but these bases and attached sugars {{can be modified}} in numerous ways as the RNAs mature. Pseudouridine (Ψ), in which the linkage between uracil and ribose is changed from a C–N bond to a C–C bond, and ribothymidine (T) are found in various places (the most notable ones being in the TΨC loop of tRNA). Another notable modified base is hypoxanthine, a deaminated adenine base whose nucleoside is called inosine (I). Inosine <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>role</b> in the wobble hypothesis of the genetic code.|$|E
5|$|The American Dream, or the {{perception}} that Americans enjoy high social mobility, <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>role</b> in attracting immigrants. Whether this perception is realistic has been a topic of debate. While mainstream culture holds that the United States is a classless society, scholars identify {{significant differences between the}} country's social classes, affecting socialization, language, and values. Americans' self-images, social viewpoints, and cultural expectations are associated with their occupations to an unusually close degree. While Americans tend greatly to value socioeconomic achievement, being ordinary or average is generally seen as a positive attribute.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode is}} {{read in a}} radically {{different}} way by Walter Goffart. According to him, the whole story assumes an allegorical meaning, with Paul intent on telling an edifying story of {{the downfall of the}} hero and his expulsion from the promised land, because of his human weakness. In this story, the skull cup <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>role</b> as it unites original sin and barbarism. Goffart does not exclude the possibility that Paul had really seen the skull, but believes that by the 740s the connection between sin and barbarism as exemplified by the skull cup had already been established.|$|E
5|$|Owing to {{the expense}} of {{refining}} pure fluorine, most commercial applications use fluorine compounds, with about half of mined fluorite used in steelmaking. The rest of the fluorite is converted into corrosive hydrogen fluoride en route to various organic fluorides, or into cryolite which <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>role</b> in aluminium refining. Organic fluorides have very high chemical and thermal stability; their major uses are as refrigerants, electrical insulation and cookware, the last as PTFE (Teflon). Pharmaceuticals such as atorvastatin and fluoxetine also contain fluorine, and the fluoride ion inhibits dental cavities, and so finds use in toothpaste and water fluoridation. Global fluorochemical sales amount to more than US$15 billion a year.|$|E
5|$|The Monmouth Rebellion and {{the events}} {{surrounding}} it have {{formed the basis for}} several works of fiction. John Dryden's work Absalom and Achitophel is a satire partially concerned with equating biblical events with the Monmouth Rebellion. The Monmouth Rebellion <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>role</b> in Peter S. Beagle's novel Tamsin, about a 300-year-old ghost who is befriended by the protagonist. Arthur Conan Doyle's historical novel Micah Clarke deals directly with Monmouth's landing in England, the raising of his army, its defeat at Sedgemoor, and the reprisals which followed. Several characters in Neal Stephenson's trilogy The Baroque Cycle, particularly Quicksilver and The Confusion, {{play a role in the}} Monmouth Rebellion and its aftermath.|$|E

5|$|As {{with many}} {{previous}} The Legend of Zelda games, solving puzzles and clearing dungeons remains a fundamental {{part of the}} gameplay. Progression through A Link Between Worlds is more open-ended than previous titles, {{with the possibility of}} tackling many of the game's dungeons in any order. Certain dungeon obstacles will require the use of the rented or purchased items. Towards the end of each dungeon, Link will encounter a boss that must be defeated. A unique mechanic that the game introduces is Link's ability to merge onto walls and move horizontally along them. Link is presented as a mural when he is merged on a wall, and upon merging, the game's perspective shifts to a side view to follow Link around corners. While merged to a wall, Link's energy gauge will deplete. The mechanic can be used for traversing the environment, reaching seemingly inaccessible areas, and avoiding hazards. It <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>role</b> in solving many of the game's puzzles and dungeons. Wall merging is also used as a means for travelling between Hyrule and Lorule, via fissures that connect the two kingdoms.|$|E
5|$|Marshal Cid Aulstyne {{leads the}} army of Milites against the other nations of Orience, {{launching}} a devastating attack against the Vermillion Peristylium and neutralising the Vermillion Bird Crystal using a crystal jammer. Class Zero, immune {{to the effects of}} the jammer, repel the invasion. During the conflict Izana Kunagiri, Machina's older brother, is killed while on a mission for Class Zero. This event later creates a rift between Machina and Class Zero. Coordinated by Kurasame and Arecia Al-Rashia, Class Zero <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>role</b> in freeing Rubrum's territories and launching counterattacks in alliance with Concordia, while Lorica's capital is destroyed by a Militesi bomb. Andoria, Concordia's queen, then forces a ceasefire between the remaining nations. During peace talks in the Militesi capital, Class Zero is framed for Andoria's murder, resulting in Concordia's puppet government and Milites launching a united assault on Rubrum. During their flight, Machina storms off after clashing with Class Zero, and becomes a White Tiger l'Cie to protect Rem from his brother's fate before returning to them. The White Tiger Crystal's will eventually forces him to leave.|$|E
5|$|The {{kingdom of}} Kosala, in the Mahajanapada era, was {{located within the}} {{regional}} boundaries of modern-day Uttar Pradesh. According to Hindu legend, the divine king Rama of the Ramayana epic reigned in Ayodhya, the capital of Kosala. Krishna, another divine king of Hindu legend, who <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>role</b> in the Mahabharata epic and is revered as the eighth reincarnation (Avatar) of the Hindu god Vishnu, {{is said to have}} been born in the city of Mathura, in Uttar Pradesh. The aftermath of the Mahabharata yuddh is believed to have taken place in the area between the Upper Doab and Delhi, (in what was Kuru Mahajanapada), during the reign of the Pandava king Yudhishthira. The kingdom of the Kurus corresponds to the Black and Red Ware and Painted Gray Ware culture and the beginning of the Iron Age in northwest India, around 1000 BC.|$|E
