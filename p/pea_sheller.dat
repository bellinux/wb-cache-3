Typically they press the peas between two rolls, which squeeze out the peas; sometimes the rolls have ridges that slice the pods open. Pea shellers have different types of mechanisms to separate the shells from the pods and other debris. Washing machine rollers can be used, for instance. Currently, pea shellers {{are made in the}} US by Welborn Devices of Mississippi, and Lehman's Hardware of Ohio.|$|E
