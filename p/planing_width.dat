40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{investigation}} was to evaluate the distribution of intratendinous injected platelet-rich plasma (PRP) after 15 minutes of prone resting versus immediate manipulation simulating weightbearing. Ten cadaveric lower limbs were injected under ultrasound guidance with PRP dyed with India blue ink. The dyed PRP was injected into the mid-portion of the Achilles tendon, after which 5 specimens were placed in the prone position for 15 minutes (simulating rest) and the remaining 5 specimens were manipulated through 100 cycles of ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion (simulating walking). Thereafter, the specimens were dissected, and the distribution of the India blue dye was ascertained. In the simulated rest group, every specimen showed dyed PRP in the Achilles tendon and in the space between the paratenon and tendon. The median craniocaudal spread of the PRP was 140 (range 125 to 190) mm. In 4 of the simulated rest tendons (80 %), the distribution of PRP extended across the entire transverse <b>plane</b> <b>width</b> of the tendon. In the simulated motion group, every specimen showed dyed PRP extending across the entire transverse <b>plane</b> <b>width</b> of the tendon and in the space between the paratenon and tendon. The median craniocaudal spread was 135 (range 115 to 117) mm. No statistically significant difference was found in the amount of craniocaudal spread between the simulated motion and rest groups. In conclusion, it does not appear to matter whether the ankle has been moved through its range of motion or maintained stationary during the first 15 minutes after PRP injection into the mid-portion of the Achilles tendon.

40|$|Numerical {{algorithms}} {{are presented}} {{to estimate the}} length, width and slope of rectangular planes representing irregularly shaped overland contributing areas defined on raster Digital Elevation Models (DEM). The strength of the procedure lies in that each flow path on the raster overland area is considered in {{the determination of the}} representative value for the entire rectangular plane as opposed to relying on a lumped, single flow path approach. The flow path parameters required by the algorithms are derived from raster maps of elevation (DEM), flow direction and upstream area. Qualitative cause-effect relations between flow path and runoff characteristics are used to emphasize those flow paths that are important to runoff formation and propagation. Based upon these considerations, the plane length and slope are computed as a weighted mean flow path length and slope over all flow paths of the overland area. Several alternative weighting factors are proposed. Based on area conservation, the <b>plane</b> <b>width</b> is computed as the overland area divided by the plane length...|$|R

40|$|The {{coupling}} {{between the}} desired CPW mode and the unwanted, slotline, mode is presented for finite ground coplanar waveguides with unequal ground <b>plane</b> <b>widths.</b> Measurements, quasi-static conformal mapping, and Method of Moment analysis are performed {{to determine the}} dependence of the slotline mode excitation on the physical dimensions of the FGC line and on the frequency range of operation. Introduction: Finite ground coplanar waveguide (FGC) is often used in low cost Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuits (MMICs) because of its many advantages over microstrip and conventional CoPlanar Waveguide (CPW). It is uniplanar, which facilitates easy connection of series and shunt elements without via holes, supports a low loss, quasi-TEM mode over a wide frequency band, and since the ground planes are electrically and physically narrow, typically less than lambda/ 5 wide where lambda is the guided wavelength, they reduce the circuit size {{and the influence of}} higher order modes. However, they still support the parasitic slotline mode that plagues all CPW transmission lines...|$|R

The simulation is performed in DesignBuilder, which integrates artificial lighting with instantaneous daylight during the energy simulation process. The geometric factors of the defined prototype are examined in both single-parameter and multi-parameter evaluations. As to the multi-parameter results, the energy saving rate can vary by up to 18. 9 %, and reducing the floor height is observed to be the most effective means of reducing annual total end-use energy consumption, followed by increasing the plane shape factor and reducing the floor area.

40|$|It is {{sometimes}} {{argued that the}} uneven sky coverage of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) biases the distribution of satellite galaxies discovered by it to align with the polar plane defined by the 11 brighter, classical Milky Way (MW) satellites. This might prevent the SDSS satellites from adding significance to the MW's Vast Polar Structure (VPOS). We investigate whether this argument is valid by comparing the observed situation with model satellite distributions confined to the exact SDSS footprint area. We find that the SDSS satellites indeed add to {{the significance of the}} VPOS and that the survey footprint rather biases away from a close alignment between the plane fitted to the SDSS satellites and the plane fitted to the 11 classical satellites. Finding the observed satellite phase-space alignments of both the classical and SDSS satellites is a 5 σ event with respect to an isotropic distribution. This constitutes a robust discovery of the VPOS and makes it more significant than the Great Plane of Andromeda (GPoA).

40|$|Several {{methods are}} used to measure {{fracture}} plane orientation. For these measurements manual, photogrammetric and laser scanning methods are in use. The latter method is used in this thesis to survey the geometry of an outcrop of the Devonian Condroz Sandstone Group in southern Belgium. The aim of this thesis {{is to develop a}} method with which the orientation of fracture planes in the Condroz Sandstone outcrop can be measured using LIDAR data. To this end, the research question is as follows: How can LIDAR data be used to find the orientation of fracture planes in the Condroz outcrop? LIDAR (i. e. Light Detection and Ranging) is a laser scanning method that captures the geometry of an object by illuminating the surface with a laser light. The fracture <b>planes</b> <b>width</b> varies between a couple of centimeters up to several meters. The research question is answered through developing a method for detecting and measuring fracture planes. The geometry of a rock face is captured in a point cloud. The normal vectors to all points in this cloud are determined and the azimuth of each point is put in a histogram. By selecting the second largest peak in this histogram and applying a nearest neighbour elimination, all points that belong to the fracture plane are selected. The dip direction and angle, which make up the orientation, are determined by selecting the median of this data set. Applying this method on several fracture planes, surveyed in the researched outcrop, seem to endorse the applicability of this method. The found results range in between the expected results after visual observations and comparison with another study. However, the validation of the results is poor, because exact measurements of the orientation of the studied fracture planes is missing. The developed method gives a basis for further research to validate, improve and automate the proposed method. This method can be used in other researches about orientation analysis using LIDAR data.
