25|$|Defamation {{law in the}} United States is {{much less}} plaintiff-friendly than its {{counterparts}} in European and the Commonwealth countries, due to {{the enforcement of the}} First Amendment.

40|$|We {{present an}} Identify Selective Antibacterial Peptides (ISAP) {{approach}} based on abstracts meaning. Laboratories and researchers have significantly increased {{the report of}} their discoveries related to antibacterial peptides in <b>primary</b> <b>publications.</b> It is important to find antibacterial peptides that {{have been reported in}} <b>primary</b> <b>publications</b> because they can produce antibiotics of different generations that attack and destroy the bacteria. Unfortunately, researchers used heterogeneous forms of natural language to describe their discoveries (sometimes without the sequence of the peptides). Thus, we propose that learning the words meaning instead of the antibacterial peptides sequence is possible to identify and predict antibacterial peptides reported in the PubMed engine. The ISAP approach consists of two stages: training and discovering. ISAP founds that the 35 % of the abstracts sample had antibacterial peptides and we tested in the updated Antimicrobial Peptide Database 2 (APD 2). ISAP predicted that 45 % of the abstracts had antibacterial peptides. That is, ISAP found that 810 antibacterial peptides were not classified like that, so they are not reported in APD 2. As a result, this new search tool would complement the APD 2 with a set of peptides that are candidates to be antibacterial. Finally, 20 % of the abstracts were not semantic related to APD 2...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) {{is an important}} cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} worldwide. Although (long-acting) bronchodilators are used to relieve symptoms, the impact of bronchodilators on COPD mortality remains an unresolved issue. Our aim was to explore the results and the interpretations of the results of studies of bronchodilator treatment from high-impact COPD trials. METHODS: We searched PubMed and Embase for <b>primary</b> <b>publications</b> of randomized controlled trials with more than 1000 participants with COPD and that studied the effectiveness of long-acting bronchodilator treatment. We assessed population characteristics, primary outcomes, focus of outcomes, and possible bias from concomitant pulmonary medication. RESULTS: We retrieved 5 <b>primary</b> <b>publications</b> of large trials. Participants tended to be patients with rather severe COPD who were cared for at a hospital. Only half of the primary outcomes were statistically significant. Reports tended to focus on statically significant outcomes and not necessarily on primary outcomes or outcomes of the whole study population. The relevance of study outcomes was rarely discussed. Discussion: The rather small effects of bronchodilators in a COPD population that is not representative for daily care, together with the tendency of relying on statistical rather than clinical significance, hampers translation to the large number of patients with COPD in the community...|$|R
