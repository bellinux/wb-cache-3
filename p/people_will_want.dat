5|$|After {{returning}} home to Singapore, Priya and Honey are fired by their boss (Archana Puran Singh) for taking a non-permitted extension of 5-days in their vacation. In order to keep their jobs, Honey suggests her boss making a television program about Krishna. Aware of Krishna's love towards her, Priya calls him to join her in Singapore to ask her mother permission to marry her. Krishna's grandmother objects to this, saying that <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>want</b> {{to take advantage of}} his abilities. She then explains that his father Rohit was hired by Dr. Siddhant Arya (Naseeruddin Shah) to design a computer that could see the future in order to prevent wars and help prepare against natural disasters. However, Rohit later found out {{that the purpose of the}} computer was not for good purposes and he destroyed the machine. Rohit reportedly died in a laboratory accident that night, with Krishna's mother, Nisha dying of a broken heart shortly thereafter. Krishna promises his grandmother that he will never reveal his powers, so she permits him to go. In Singapore, during the program's production, Krishna keeps his word and reveals nothing exceptional about himself much to the disappointment of Honey and Priya, who get fired again.|$|E
500|$|The {{group and}} the music {{industry}} were unsure how fans would receive the tour beforehand. During {{the first week of}} shows, Bono said, [...] "This show is a real roller coaster ride, and some <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>want</b> to get off, I'm sure." [...] He remained optimistic that their devoted fans would continue following them, but cautioned {{he had no intention of}} resisting the glamour and fame: [...] "Oh, but it's fun to be carried away by the hype. Where would you be without the hype?... You can't pretend all the promotion and all the fanfare is not happening." [...] Some hardcore fans, particularly in the US, objected to the tour as a blatant sellout to commercial values, while others misinterpreted the tour's mocking of excess, believing that, according to VH1's Legends, [...] "U2 had 'lost it' and that Bono had become an egomaniac". Many Christian fans were offended the band's antics and believed they had abandoned their religious faith.|$|E

Rai, in {{his review}} for Stardust stated, [...] "it {{can be said that}} the {{grandeur}} and vintage character of Mughal-e-Azam cannot be repeated, and it will remembered {{as one of the most}} significant films made in this country." [...] Ziya Us Salam of The Hindu described Mughal-e-Azam as a film <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>want</b> to watch over and over again. Raja Sen of Rediff compared the film to Spartacus (1960) and said, [...] "Mughal-e-Azam is awesomely, stunningly overwhelming, a magnificent spectacle entirely free of CGI and nonlinear gimmickry, a gargantuan feat of... of... well, of Mughal proportions!" [...] Laura Bushell of the BBC rated the film four out of five stars, considering it to be a [...] "benchmark film for both Indian cinema and cinema grandeur in general", and remarking that Mughal-E-Azam was an epic film in every way. Naman Ramachandran, reviewing the film for the British Film Institute, noted the depiction of religious tolerance and said the film had a tender heart.|$|E

2500|$|In 2006, areas {{planted with}} wheat in Egypt {{exceeded}} [...] producing approximately 6 million metric tons. The domestic supply price farmers receive in Egypt is EGP 1200 ( [...] US$211) per ton compared to approximately EGP 1940 ( [...] US$340) per ton for import from the USA, Egypt's main supplier of wheat and corn. Egypt is the U.S.'s largest market for wheat and corn sales, accounting for US$1 billion annually and about 46% of Egypt's needs from imported wheat. Other sources of imported wheat, include Kazakhstan, Canada, France, Syria, Argentina and Australia. There are {{plans to increase}} the areas planted with wheat up to nearly [...] by 2017 to narrow the gap between domestic food supply and demand. However, the low amount of gluten in Egypt wheat means that foreign wheat must be mixed in to produce bread that <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>want</b> to eat.|$|E

[...] He continued to give an explanation {{as to why the}} songs are similar writing [...] "On the surface, similarities between the two are almost non-existent, but on closer inspection, not only are they the danciest cuts on their respective LPs, they're both favourites that fans have been eager to see get an official release." [...] Copsey concluded his review praising the song and Rihanna, writing [...] "Like Rihanna herself, it's hectic, confident and unashamedly sexual." [...] Meghan Brownfield for the Columbia Missourian praised the song as a track which <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>want</b> to dance to as well as writing that the lyrics ensure that the listener pays attention to the lyrics, saying [...] "It is a song you would hear in a club that everyone would want to dance to. This song makes you want to move, and it also has some strong lyrics that make you focus on what she is saying." [...] Matthew Cole for Slant Magazine, however, was critical of the song, writing that the song is a [...] "boring dubstep-normalizing dance number reminiscent of LMFAO," [...] as well as Rihanna's own [...] "We Found Love".|$|E
6000|$|But {{here the}} socialist and his school interpose at once with an objection. Under the socialist commonwealth, they say, the <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>want</b> to work; {{they will have}} {{acquired}} a new civic spirit; they will work eagerly and cheerfully {{for the sake of}} the public good and from their love of the system under which they live.

Even crime itself, so the socialist tells us, will diminish to the vanishing point, till there is nothing of it except here and there a sort of pathological survival, an atavism, or a [...] "throwing back" [...] to the forgotten sins of the grandfathers.

5000|$|The {{velocity}} of money provides another perspective on money demand. Given the nominal flow of transactions using money, if {{the interest rate}} on alternative financial assets is high, <b>people</b> <b>will</b> not <b>want</b> to hold much money relative to the quantity of their transactions - they try to exchange it fast for goods or other financial assets, and money is said to [...] "burn a hole in their pocket" [...] and velocity is high. This situation is precisely one of money demand being low. Conversely, with a low opportunity cost velocity is low and money demand is high. In money market equilibrium, some economic variables (interest rates, income, or the price level) have adjusted to equate money demand and money supply.|$|R

50|$|However, {{there are}} some {{problems}} that arise with this new system. These discs and DVD players will cost more than the non-DRM encoded ones. <b>People</b> <b>will</b> not <b>want</b> to buy this new system because it costs more than the universal systems that work with all players and with all forms of DVDs. Another problem with this new DRM system is that this format is no longer compatible with all DVD players and disc readers. This caused more trouble because users needed to own the specific reader in order to play the disc. This scheme was usurped {{by the emergence of}} buying movies online. Thus far, this scheme has not been implemented. If it was implemented then it {{would not be able to}} become a universal technology that everyone can use.|$|R

A bust is a period of mismatch. This view made Black an early contributor to real business cycle theory.|$|E
30|$|The TinyTask {{designer}} {{aimed to}} design a BIT that was (1) enabling, motivating, and engaging, and (2) {{at the same time}} unobtrusive, discreet, and aesthetically pleasing. These intentions were informed by two challenges. The first was that engaging in intentional activities is not necessarily easy. A person needs to ‘get over the hurdle’ of remembering to do them and overcome obstacles in initiating them, and this kind of self-regulatory effort requires considerable self-discipline and willpower (Sheldon and Elliot 1998; Lyubomirsky et al. 2005). In other words, effectively initiating and pursuing happiness-increasing activities requires commitment and effort. As a consequence, people often need external support to be able to invest the time and energy necessary for sustainable behavioural change, and to effectively translate acquired knowledge into practice (Bolier 2015). The second challenge was that <b>people</b> <b>will</b> only <b>want</b> to use BITs if they provide acceptable levels of privacy and are unobtrusive, aesthetically pleasing, and trustworthy; people do not accept BITs that rely on the use of complicated, invasive, or demanding interfaces (Consolvo et al. 2009; Montague et al. 2009).|$|R
