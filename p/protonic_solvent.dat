30|$|In addition, the {{electron}} blocking layer (EBL) at {{the interface between}} the CQD thin film and the metal electrode {{is used in the}} same principle to prevent recombination by blocking the hole transport at the interface. In this case, EBL prevents the movement of electrons to the metal electrode through the energy band shift of ethanedithiol (EDT)-treated CQD film [22]. Therefore, high-efficiency CQD PVs can be achieved by using an EBL to reduce electron recombination. In this structure, the number of surface defects and the type of ligands vary depending on the acidity of the <b>protonic</b> <b>solvent</b> used in the ligand exchange process. An efficiency higher than 10 % has been reported for CQD PVs produced by changing the electrical properties of CQD films with various protic solvents in the ligand exchange process (Fig.  4 b) [23].|$|E

The author presents the operating principle of a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell and of its proton conducting membrane, respectively. Therefore, {{on the base of}} immobilization of imidazole, polymer materials with an intrinsic conductivity at temperatures greater then 373 K are synthesized. The concept of the polymer bounded <b>protonic</b> <b>solvent</b> is realized by means of polysiloxanes, surface modified nanoparticles of silica gel and oligomers of siloxane. Polysiloxanes are comblike polymers with covalently bounded imidazol {{at the end of the}} side chains. The oligomers have an identical structure in comparison to the polymers, but they have a lower molecular weight and are cyclic mostly. The nanoparticles are synthesized grafting with spacer units containing imidazole. All materials are characterized in the light of thermal behavior, stability, conductivity, diffusion and dielectric behavior. In order to examine the conductance and diffusion behavior, trifluoromethane sulphonic acid is used to provide the materials with protons as supplementary charge carrier. The flexible, glass formating oligomers and polymers have glass transition temperatures in the range from 272 to 314 K. The thermal stability of these materials reaches to 473 K. The pure, modified nanoparticles are not conductive. The conductivity of the oligomers and polymers depends on the glass transition temperature and softening behavior, respectively. With decreasing glass temperature, the flexibility of the system and the conductivity increase. Due to the immobilization of imidazole on the oligomer or polymer, the charge transport only is due to structural diffusion because no vehicle mechanism is possible. At a doping degree of 10 per cent, the doping of the materials increases the conductivity by a factor of 2. The addition of more acid does not influence the conductivity. The conductivity of the undoped materials only is due to charge carriers which rise from autoprotolysis of imidazole. According to the diffusion data, imidazole is immobilized at the oligomers. This is due to the negligible small self-diffusion of the oligomers. Therefore, the conductivity and the proton transfer are due to structural diffusion. A comparison of conductivity data and diffusion data using the Nernst-Einstein-relation yields only a very small part of diffusive protons which does not contribute to the conductivity. The mixture of nanoparticles and oligomer improves the mechanical properties. Above a certain mixing ratio, the conductivity of the oligomer does not depend on the mixture ratio. The consistency of the oligomer is variable in the range from brittle to leatherlike. The materials do not show any relaxation processes using dielectric spectroscopy. However, the temperature dependence of the dielectric constant can be determined graphically.

Polymerization was performed under gamma rays irradiation {{of a water}} solution of monomers (M 4 K), or of the monomer mixture (M 4 A), at room temperature. High affinity to <b>protonic</b> <b>solvents</b> was observed for both materials. Palladium catalysts were prepared from M 4 K through ion-exchange with [Pd(NH 3) 4] 2 + and from M 4 A through ion-exchange with palladium acetate; the subsequent Pd(II) reduction with sodium borohydride in ethanol yielded the final catalysts with a uniform distribution of metal throughout the resin particles. The average size of metal crystallites obtained by X-ray diffraction was about 4 nm and did not show any dependence on metal content in the polymer {{in the range from}} 0. 5 to 8. 8 w/w % of metal. The rate of hydrogenation of p-nitrotoluene and cyclohexene in catalytic tests with 1 and 0. 5 w/w % Pd catalysts was proportional to the metal content in catalysts, which confirmed a very good accessibility of these supports. Catalysts with low metal content also exhibit a significant deactivation {{in the course of the}} hydrogenation of p-nitrotoluene to p-toluidine in methanol under ambient conditions...|$|R
40|$|An {{account is}} given of some recent {{developments}} in the chemistry of solutions in highly associated strong <b>protonic</b> acid <b>solvents,</b> including sulphuric acid and oleums, fluorosuiphuric acid and hydrogen fluoride. Topics discussed include solvent—solute interactions, super-acid systems, Hammett acidity functions and polyatomic cations {{of the elements of}} Groups VI and VII. iNTRODUCTION This paper reviews certain aspects of chemistry in the solvents sulphuric acid, disuiphuric acid and oleum, fluorosuiphuric acid, and anhydrous hydrogen fluoride. SOLVENT CHARACTERISTICS All. of the solvents mentioned above have certain characteristics in common, which significantly affect their behaviour as solvents. They are all of course very strong protonic acids, or, otherwise expressed, electron-pair acceptors. Their most characteristic interaction with another molecule is the formation of a strong hydrogen bond, followed in most cases by transfer of a proton to the basic species (electron pair donor) involved...|$|R
40|$|The electron-nuclear Overhauser {{effect on}} spin ½ nuclei in {{solutions}} containing free radicals has been calculated from a method based on treatment used by Solomon. The magnitude and {{sign of the}} enhancement of the nuclear signal, which may be represented by a factor ρ depends on the nature and time dependence of the the electron-nuclear signal, which {{is assumed to be}} either dipolar or scalar. The time dependence for the dipole-dipole interactions is assumed to arise from the translational diffusion of the free radicals and the molecule containing the nuclei. three models are employed for the scalar interactions. In the first of these, termed the Sticking Model, the scalar interaction is assumed to be finite only while a molecule and free radical are "stuck" together. Thus sticking time is assumed to be short in comparison with the diffusional correlation time. However, an alternative model in which this assumption is not made has been postulated to explain certain experimental results. This is termed the Modified Sticking Model. In the third model, called the Diffusion Model, the hypothesis is made that the scalar interaction is a very short range interaction with magnitude ℏ B(d/R) exp. [-λ(r-d) ]. where λ d ≫ 1, B and λ are constants, R is the distance between a nucleus and an electron, and d is the distances of the closest approach, inside of which the interaction is zero. In this model the time dependence of the scalar interaction, {{as in the case of}} the dipolar interactions, arises from the relative diffusion of the molecules and free radicals in the solution. For all the models of the scalar interaction, ρ may be plotted as a function of w s τ c where w s is the electron Larmor frequency and τ c the correlation time and it is found that the sign of &rho may change. The product w s τ c may be altered by working at different magnetic fields or changing ρ c. From measurements, at two different magnetic fields, of the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation times, the concentration of free radical in the solution and ρ, the theories allow the calculation of the mean diffusion coefficient of the radicals and molecules in solution, the correlation times and the measure of the relative importance of scalar and dipolar interactions. Experiments on fluorinated and <b>protonic</b> <b>solvents</b> containing the radical tri-tert-butyl phenoxyl (T. T. B. P) have been carried out at two different magnetic fields. The proton-free radical interactions may be explained in terms of dipole-dipole interactions. On the other hand with fluorine nuclei scalar coupling does seem to be important. The Sticking Model does not successfully describe the effect of this coupling. The other models give reasonable values for the calculable parameters, but it is difficult to decide unambiguously between them. If scalar coupling does occur, a scalar shift of the nuclear resonance is expected. this has been observed for hexaflourobenzene solutions containing T. T. B. P. The theoretical and experimental results are compared, and while either theory might explain the observed shift, less assumptions have to be made in using the Diffusion Model. The correlation time dependence of the Overhauser effect has also been studied for two systems, hexafluorobenzene and 1 - 1 - 1 -trichloro- 2 - 2 - 2 -trifluoro-ethane, at two magnetic fields. The correlation times were altered by addition of carbon disulphide or a chlorinated hydrocarbon or by changing the temperature of the sample. Qualitatively the Diffusion Model was in best agreement with the experimental results, but quantitatively, neither model was satisfactory. In the Diffusion Model, the assumption λd≫ 1 is made and in an attempt to obtain better agreement with the experimental results ρ has been calculated using different values of λd in thescalar interaction function. The best agreement between experiment and theory was for values of λd≫ 1000. Measurements of the proton electron Overhauser effect can usually be interpreted in terms of dipolar interactions (positive ρ) between the electrons and the protons. However for the resonances of the tert-butyl groups of tri-tert-butyl phenol in solutions of T. T. B. P. ρ is negative. This has been shown to be associated with the proton exchange between the radical and phenol molecules. It is postulated that in the radical molecule the scalar coupling between the electron and the tert-buyl protons, occurs at least in part by a hyperconjugative mechanism. the random rotation of these tert-butyl groups could modulate this scalar coupling. This would lead to a positive polarization of the tert-butyl protons, which persists when the radical accepts a proton and becomes a tri-tert-butyl phenol molecule. </p...|$|R
