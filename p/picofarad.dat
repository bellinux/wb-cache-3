5000|$|The {{capacitance}} of {{the majority}} of capacitors used in electronic circuits is generally several orders of magnitude smaller than the farad. The most common subunits of capacitance in use today are the microfarad (µF), nanofarad (nF), <b>picofarad</b> (pF), and, in microcircuits, femtofarad (fF). However, specially made supercapacitors can be much larger (as much as hundreds of farads), and parasitic capacitive elements can be less than a femtofarad. In the past, alternate subunits were used in historical electronic books; [...] "mfd" [...] and [...] "mf" [...] for microfarad (µF); [...] "mmfd", [...] "mmf", [...] "µµF" [...] for <b>picofarad</b> (pF); but are rarely used any more.|$|E
50|$|The statfarad (abbreviated statF) is a {{rarely used}} CGS unit {{equivalent}} to the {{capacitance of a capacitor}} with a charge of 1 statcoulomb across a potential difference of 1 statvolt. It is 1/(10−5c2) farad, approximately 1.1126 <b>picofarads.</b>|$|R

The close electrode spacing used in microwave tubes increases capacitances, but this increase is offset by their overall reduced dimensions compared to lower-frequency tubes.|$|R

50|$|In {{biological}} organisms, ion channels {{regulate the}} flow of ions (for example, sodium, calcium, potassium) across the membrane in all cells. Current density is measured in pA∙pF−1 (picoamperes per <b>picofarad),</b> that is, current divided by capacitance, a de facto measure of membrane area.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>picofarad</b> is {{sometimes}} colloquially pronounced as [...] "puff" [...] or [...] "pic", as in [...] "a ten-puff capacitor". Similarly, [...] "mic" [...] (pronounced [...] "mike") {{is sometimes}} used informally to signify microfarads. If the Greek letter μ is not available, the notation [...] "uF" [...] {{is often used}} {{as a substitute for}} [...] "μF" [...] in electronics literature. A [...] "micro-microfarad" [...] (μμF, and confusingly often mmf or MMF), an obsolete unit sometimes found in older texts, is the equivalent of a <b>picofarad.</b> In texts prior to 1960, and on capacitor packages even much more recently, [...] "mf" [...] or [...] "MFD" [...] rather than the modern [...] "µF" [...] frequently represented microfarads. Similarly, [...] "mmf" [...] or [...] "MMFD" [...] represented picofarads.|$|E

These were disallowed with the introduction of the SI.|$|R
25|$|The {{maximum output}} {{frequency}} (controlled signal) {{is limited by}} the parasitic capacitance of a RO, which originates from the electrodes formed {{on the surface of the}} photoresistor and shunts the output circuit.

25|$|General-purpose {{oscilloscopes}} usually {{present an}} input impedance of 1 megohm {{in parallel with}} a small but known capacitance such as 20 <b>picofarads.</b> This allows the use of standard oscilloscope probes. Scopes for use with very high frequencies may have 50‑ohm inputs, which must be either connected directly to a 50‑ohm signal source or used with Z0 or active probes.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the long}} (or English) scale, a billionth {{is equal to}} 0.000 000 000 001, or 1 x 10−12 in {{scientific}} notation. The prefix for this number is pico-, and is abbreviated as [...] "p" [...] (for example, in electronics, one <b>picofarad</b> would be written as 1 pF).|$|E
50|$|Historically, a farad was {{regarded}} as an inconveniently large unit, both electrically and physically. Its subdivisions were invariably used, namely the microfarad, nanofarad and <b>picofarad.</b> More recently, technology has advanced such that capacitors of 1 farad and greater (so-called 'supercapacitors') can be constructed in a structure little larger than a coin battery. Such capacitors are principally used for energy storage replacing more traditional batteries.|$|E
50|$|Active scope probes use a {{high-impedance}} high-frequency amplifier {{mounted in}} the probe head, and a screened lead. The purpose of the amplifier is not gain, but isolation (buffering) between the circuit under test and the oscilloscope and cable, loading the circuit with only a low capacitance and high DC resistance, and matching the oscilloscope input. Active probes are commonly seen by the circuit under test as a capacitance of 1 <b>picofarad</b> or less in parallel with 1 megohm resistance. Probes {{are connected to the}} oscilloscope with a cable matching the characteristic impedance of the oscilloscope input. Tube based active probes were used before the advent of high-frequency solid-state electronics, using a small vacuum tube as cathode follower amplifier.|$|E

50|$|Ordinary lamp cord has a {{capacitance}} of 10-20 pF per foot, {{plus a few}} <b>picofarads</b> of stray capacitance, so a 50-foot run (100 total feet of conductor) {{will have}} less than 1 percent capacitive loss in the audible range. Some premium speaker cables have higher capacitance {{in order to have}} lower inductance; 100-300 pF is typical, in which case the capacitive loss will exceed 1 percent for runs longer than about 5 feet (10 feet of conductor).|$|R
50|$|Capacitors may {{be marked}} with 4 or more colored bands or dots. The colors encode {{the first and}} second most {{significant}} digits of the value, and the third color the decimal multiplier in <b>picofarads.</b> Additional bands have meanings which may vary from one type to another. Low-tolerance capacitors may begin with the first 3 (rather than 2) digits of the value. It is usually, but not always, possible to work out what scheme is used by the particular colors used. Cylindrical capacitors marked with bands may look like resistors.|$|R
5000|$|Many ESD guns have {{interchangeable}} modules containing different discharge Networks or RC Modules (Specific {{resistance and}} capacitance values) to simulate different discharges. These modules typically {{slide into the}} handle of the pistol portion of the ESD simulator, much like loading some handguns. They change the characteristics of the waveshape discharged from the pistol and are called out in general standards like IEC 61000-4-2, SAE J113 and industry specific standards like ISO 10605. Resistance is referred to in ohms (Ω), capacitance is referred to in <b>picofarad</b> (pF or [...] "puff"). The most commonly used discharge network is for IEC 61000-4-2 and ISO 10605, expressed as 150pF/330Ω. There are over 50 combinations of resistance and capacitance depending on the standards and the applicable electronics.|$|E
5000|$|For {{testing the}} {{susceptibility}} of electronic devices to ESD from human contact, an ESD Simulator {{with a special}} output circuit, called the human body model (HBM) is often used. This consists of a capacitor in series with a resistor. The capacitor is charged to a specified high voltage from an external source, and then suddenly discharged through the resistor into an electrical terminal of the device under test. One {{of the most widely}} used models is defined in the JEDEC 22-A114-B standard, which specifies a 100 <b>picofarad</b> capacitor and a 1500 ohm resistor. Other similar standards are MIL-STD-883 Method 3015, and the ESD Association's ESD STM5.1. For comportment to European Union standards for Information Technology Equipment, the IEC/EN 61000-4-2 test specification is used. Another spec. (Schaffner) C=150pF R=330R that gives high fidelity results. Mostly the theory is there, minimum of the companies measure the real ESD survival rate.

This method of indirect use of measuring capacitance ensures greater precision. The bridge usually can also measure series resistance and inductance. Through the use of Kelvin connections and other careful design techniques, these instruments can usually measure capacitors over a range from <b>picofarads</b> to farads. Combined LCR meters that can measure inductance, resistance, and capacitance are available.|$|R

The circuit is designed to measure the capacitance between the rotor blades and sensor electrodes implanted into the substrate beneath the rotor.
