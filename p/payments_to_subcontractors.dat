One {{of the causes of}} this economic slump in 1873 was speculation on railroads. Recall that the Wisconsin Central received financial support from towns like Menasha and Stevens Point? By this time they had spent that money, and with the nationwide economic slump, financier Gardner Colby was having trouble raising more money from his investors. They were already behind on <b>payments</b> <b>to</b> <b>subcontractors</b> and for that reason in 1874 the construction contractor on the south end quit.|$|E
40|$|One of the {{greatest}} risks for clients lies in paying for work in progress. In an age of digital technology {{the development of a}} universal approach to the management of fair <b>payments</b> <b>to</b> <b>subcontractors</b> in Australia remains a challenge. Location Based Management (LBM) micromilestones has been suggested as an innovative solution to reducing the risk in progress payments. The location-based solution proposed focuses on work completion micromilestones to build process reference models for auto-generation of subcontractor certification and payment. Sub-contractors are vital for construction. Studies show that subcontracting for unique construction projects is both efficient and economical simply because general contractors are less skilled and more expensive than subcontractors. However, tardy payment remains a global problem. In Australia, payment systems rely on monthly lump-sum assessments of work, often after work has been completed. This retrospective method for validation of site-work is subject to error. Further, the lack of adequate site records often impedes compilation of a comprehensive payment record. This paper proposes a method that ensures payments are based on work completed and are connected to the productive delivery ofthe project...|$|E

40|$|Expectation of owner payment {{punctuality}} and completeness is {{of primary}} concern to a contractor before it commits {{to a new}} project. When payments are delayed or less than expected, the contractor's financial position and project performance are affected. This thesis proposes a number of analytical tools for contractors to anticipate and deal with late and incomplete payments. These tools allow contractors <b>to</b> estimate <b>payment</b> probability, plot cash flow and analyse different claim/payment strategies. The analytical tools also apply <b>to</b> <b>subcontractors</b> receiving <b>payments</b> from contractors, and <b>to</b> consultants receiving <b>payments</b> from owners or contractors. Initiating from an existing Markov chain formulation of contractor payments, the thesis presents a tree form classification model of owner payment practices. Following the splits of the tree, each owner payment profile ends {{up in one of}} ten terminal nodes, corresponding <b>to</b> ten owner <b>payment</b> types ranging from the worst to the best. A sensitivity study and test of the stationarity hypothesis of the Markov chain formulation of contractor <b>payments</b> is presented <b>to</b> reinforce the validity of the Markov chain formulation. The likelihood of <b>payment</b> <b>to</b> <b>subcontractors,</b> which are subject <b>to</b> double <b>payment</b> uncertainties associated with owners and contractors, is modelled. Suggestions are made <b>to</b> <b>subcontractors</b> <b>to</b> calculate the age-dependent probabilities of outstanding claim amounts being paid based on contractor and owner typical payment behaviour. The payment lateness and incompleteness associated with each owner type is used in an example to establish the cash flow forecast of a future project. Present worth analysis is performed to assess the feasibility of a project, based on different mark-ups and <b>payment</b> policies <b>to</b> lower level creditors. The classification of owner payment behaviour is incorporated in an overall multi-criteria owner evaluation framework. This framework allows contractors to understand owner characteristics, and consequently aid the mitigation of risks associated with working with owners. This thesis is an original contribution to current contractor's risk analysis practices and an extension of existing contractor claim-payment analysis. It will potentially help improve contractor's cash flow management, reduce project failures and {{contribute to the development of}} the construction industry in general...|$|R

This study identified the most important causes of delay from a list 45 different causes and 5 different effects of delay and the recommendation to reduce the delay. The most important causes were delays in contractor's <b>payments</b> <b>to</b> <b>subcontractors,</b> shortage of material in construction, delays in sub-contractors, change in material, the weather condition, shortage of manpower (skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled labour), construction works involve huge amounts of money, unpunctually material delivery, labour productivity, and unavailability of incentives for contractor for finishing ahead of schedule.

40|$|Construction {{is a risky}} {{business}} with only 47 % of startup businesses in construction operating after four years. The indirect costs of failed companies far exceed the direct costs of their failure. Cash is often seen {{as the most important}} element of construction companies and their operation. Adequate sources of capital, and a reasonable liabilities-to-assets ratio, are critical for business continuity and success. A lack of cash can mean no <b>payments</b> <b>to</b> <b>subcontractors,</b> laborers, and crews, and no purchases of needed materials. It can lead to limited ability to complete tasks on site, cutting corners in work, or slower pace to match the amount of cash available. Negative outcomes can include delayed or incomplete work or increased financing costs and project risks. Ultimately, construction companies risk failure if they sustain cash flow limitations for some time despite the fact they could be profitable. In this research, we developed a cash flow model for the assessment of construction companies’ operations and their potential for failure. The cash flow model describes a company’s operational strength using a cash flow cycle with three measures: 1) cash flow cycle profitability, 2) cash flow cycle duration, and 3) access to additional access. We theoretically establish the importance and justification for each measure. Using a dataset comprised of full quarterly financial records for construction companies tracked over 20 years, we validate the suitability of the cash flow model in predicting construction company failure 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years in advance of failure event at a statistically significant level...|$|E
40|$|Imagine {{that the}} city council of Ghent has {{approved}} {{the construction of a}} new bridge across the Leie. The bridge will serve as a means to reduce traffic congestion in the city center, and the city council imposes a deadline to ensure the bridge is completed in time. Based on the specifications, a contractor subsequently determines the required resources (e. g. manpower, machines) and constructs a project schedule. This schedule holds the start and finish times of each activity (e. g. pouring concrete for the bridge foundations), and respects the imposed resource restrictions and the order in which the activities have to be executed (e. g. excavate the river banks before pouring concrete for the foundations). Whereas the objective of the client (i. e. the city council) is clear, they want the bridge to be constructed within the specified deadline, the objective for the contractor is less obvious. Is the goal to minimize the project duration, minimize total costs, maximize net present value (NPV), etc. ? Assume that the contractor can construct two schedules. The first schedule minimizes the project duration, obtains a duration of 6 weeks less than the deadline and has a NPV of € 1 mio. The second schedule, on the contrary, maximizes the project NPV, which results in a duration equal to the deadline and a NPV of € 1. 2 mio. The latter schedule is obtained by delaying certain activities within the imposed restrictions, starting from the first schedule. If we assume that sufficient margins are included in the proposed schedules to compensate for any delays, the contractor would obviously prefer the second schedule, since the financial return is larger. The crucial question here is, however, how the second schedule can be obtained in an effective and efficient manner starting from the first schedule. This dissertation aims to develop algorithms, which optimize the project NPV under different restrictions, by means of five studies. The first paper chapter focuses on NPV optimization subject to precedence and resource restrictions. It is furthermore assumed that both cash inflows (payments received from the client) and cash outflows (<b>payments</b> <b>to</b> <b>subcontractors)</b> occur at the end of each activity. This way, the size of payments is set in advance by the client and corresponds with each activity’s cash flows, whereas the timing depends on the project schedule by means of the selected activity finish times, and is controlled by the contractor. The second and third studies consider other payment models, in which the client determines the payment times in advance, rather than the size of payments. As an example, the client may stipulate that the contractor is paid every month, whereas the size of the payments depends on the work performed by the contractor in each month. Both studies furthermore include several alternatives or modes for each activity. These modes constitute different duration-resource combinations for an activity, out of which one has to be selected by the contractor, and allow for a greater degree of flexibility. The fourth paper chapter introduces capital management on the side of the contractor, by imposing that the total funds available should not become negative during the project. The total funds or cash balance consider the initial capital available and respectively add or subtract cash in- and outflows. A general model is constructed which affects the capital availability throughout the project. The fifth and final study integrates the resource availability in the scheduling process, and as such optimizes the NPV of the project including the resource usage cost, rather than decide on the amount of a resource made available first and schedule the activities second. nrpages: 170 status: publishe...|$|E

For example, Brookhaven reimbursed the subcontractor for per diem on days when work was not performed and when the subcontractor did not pay subsistence expenses to its technicians. Brookhaven also increased the subcontracts' fixed reimbursement rates without adequate justification and reimbursed the subcontractor for overtime even though the subcontract did not provide for an overtime reimbursement rate.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a case study of}} the use of {{multiple}} linear regression analysis to quantify a claim for extra <b>payment</b> <b>to</b> a <b>subcontractor</b> for work on a substantial construction earth-moving project. The basis of the claim was that the client and main contractor required the work to be executed in ways other than that originally planned by the subcontractor, reducing efficiency and so increasing costs. The authors of this paper represented the earth-moving subcontractor in a legal arbitration, in which this application of multiple linear regression analysis was fundamental to quantifying the amount claimed in the case. The analysis determined the time required to perform earth-moving tasks, based on a set of explanatory variables, using data sets recorded on-site. The same equation was then applied to the plan of work used for the tender and was used to show that the comparative efficiency between tender and actual was as low as 25 %. The claim was successful, and the calculations described in this paper were used to quantify a total additional payment of approximately �; 380 000.
