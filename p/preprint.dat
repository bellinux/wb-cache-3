With this explosion in scientific output, a significant bottleneck has been the ability to rapidly disseminate new knowledge to peers and the public. <b>Preprints</b> have emerged as a tool that {{a growing number of}} microbiologists are using to overcome this bottleneck. Posting <b>preprints</b> can help to transparently recruit a more diverse pool of reviewers prior to submitting to a journal for formal peer review. Although the use of <b>preprints</b> is still limited in the biological sciences, early indications are that <b>preprints</b> are a robust tool that can complement and enhance peer-reviewed publications.

In admissions recorded with the <b>preprinted</b> notes the mean number of core clinical details present was significantly higher than those recorded with traditional notes (24. 0 v 17. 6, p < 0. 00001). Admissions recorded with the <b>preprinted</b> notes were also significantly shorter (mean 144 words v 184 words, p < 0. 0001).

The characteristics of the radiation detected by Penzias and Wilson fit exactly the radiation predicted by Robert H. Dicke and his colleagues at Princeton University. Penzias called Dicke at Princeton, who immediately sent him a copy of the still-unpublished Peebles paper. Penzias read the paper and called Dicke again and invited him to Bell Labs to look at the horn antenna and listen to the background noise. Dicke, Peebles, Wilkinson and P. G.

25|$|On September 22, 2011, a <b>preprint</b> {{from the}} OPERA Collaboration {{indicated}} detection of 17 and 28 GeV muon neutrinos, sent 730 kilometers (454 miles) from CERN near Geneva, Switzerland to the Gran Sasso National Laboratory in Italy, traveling faster than light by a relative amount of 2.48×10−5 (approximately 1 in 40,000), a statistic with 6.0-sigma significance. On 17 November 2011, a second follow-up experiment by OPERA scientists confirmed their initial results. However, scientists were {{skeptical about the}} results of these experiments, the significance of which was disputed. In March 2012, the ICARUS collaboration failed to reproduce the OPERA results with their equipment, detecting neutrino travel time from CERN to the Gran Sasso National Laboratory indistinguishable from the speed of light. Later the OPERA team reported two flaws in their equipment set-up that had caused errors far outside their original confidence interval: a fiber optic cable attached improperly, which caused the apparently faster-than-light measurements, and a clock oscillator ticking too fast.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{establish}} {{a set of}} guidelines for developing ambulatory chemotherapy <b>preprinted</b> orders. Methods: Multiple methods were used to develop the <b>preprinted</b> order guidelines. These included (A) a comprehensive literature review and an environmental scan; (B) analyses of field study observations and incident reports; (C) critical review of evidence from the literature and the field study observation analyses; (D) review of the draft guidelines by a clinical advisory group; and (E) collaboration with graphic designers to develop sample <b>preprinted</b> orders, refine the design guidelines, and format the resulting content. Results: The Guidelines for Developing Ambulatory Chemotherapy <b>Preprinted</b> Orders, which consist of guidance on the design process, content, and graphic design elements of ambulatory chemotherapy <b>preprinted</b> orders, have been established. Conclusion: Health care is a safety critical, dynamic, and complex sociotechnical system. Identifying safety risks in such a system and effectively addressing them often require the expertise of multiple disciplines. This study illustrates how human factors professionals, clinicians, and designers can leverage each other's expertise to uncover commonly overlooked patient safety hazards and {{to provide health care}} professionals with innovative, practical, and user-centered tools to minimize those hazards...|$|R
