40|$|The {{electrical}} {{properties of the}} light ion impurities H, O and C in GaN have been examined in both as-grown and implanted material. H is found to efficiently <b>passivate</b> <b>acceptors</b> such as Mg, Ca and C. Reactivation occurs at {ge} 450 C and is enhanced by minority carrier injection. The hydrogen does not leave the GaN crystal until > 800 C, and its diffusivity is relatively high ({approximately} 10 {sup {minus} 11 } cm{sup 2 }/s) even at low temperatures (< 200 C) during injection by wet etching, boiling in water or plasma exposure. Oxygen shows a low donor activation efficiency when implanted into GaN, with an ionization level of 30 [...] 40 meV. It is essentially immobile up to 1, 100 C. Carbon can produce low p-type levels (3 {times} 10 {sup 17 } cm{sup {minus} 3 }) in GaN during MOMBE, although {{there is some evidence}} it may also create n-type conduction in other nitrides...|$|E
40|$|Hydrogen is an {{important}} impurity in ZnO, and it is believed {{to act as a}} shallow donor and to <b>passivate</b> <b>acceptors</b> in the material. H is readily associated with other defects in ZnO, forming complexes with characteristic localized vibrational modes (LVMs). The H-related peaks observed in the IR absorption spectra of ZnO is thus highly dependent on the concentration of other impurities and native defects. In this work, H-related defects in hydrothermally (HT) grown ZnO single crystals have been investigated by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) and four point resistivity measurements. Due to a high concentration of Li acceptors, the LVM of a OH-Li complex dominates the IR spectra of the as-grown samples. Several other H-related peaks are however also observed. The results presented in this work indicate that the 3577 cm- 1 peak associated to the OH-Li defect exhibits a complex annealing dependency, which may be explained by a process involving diffusion and recapture of H. Also, dissociation of the defect occurs at substantially lower temperatures than the previously reported thermal stability of 1200 °C. The absorption cross section of the OH-Li signal has been estimated to be 1. 27 x 10 ^(- 17) cm. A group of IR absorption peaks at 4216, 4240 and 4246 cm- 1 have also beenobserved in the IR spectra of as-grown samples. By comparison with SIMS measurements, the previous identification of these peaks as internal electronic transitions of substitutional Ni_(Zn) impurities has been verified. The absorption cross section of the peaks {{has been found to be}} 2. 91 x 10 ^(- 17) cm. Several other H-related peaks appeared in the IR spectra recorded after annealing of the samples in H 2 and/or D 2 atmospheres, caused by diffusion of H/D into the crystals. Two IR absorption peaks at 3303 and 3321 cm- 1 were assigned to the LVMs of a defect complex labeled H-X, consisting of two O-H bonds associated to an unknown impurity atom. The 3321 cm- 1 mode is oriented along the c-axis of ZnO, while the 3303 cm- 1 mode is oriented at an angle with the c-axis. The H-X complex is thermally stable up to ~ 600 °C and the activation energy fordissociation was estimated to be 2. 8 eV. An IR absorption peak at 2783 cm- 1 was also observed after hydrogenation. This peak was assigned to the LVM of a defect complex labeled H-Y, involving a single O-H bond oriented at an angle with the c-axis. Also, a pair of peaks at 3347 and 3374 cm- 1 were observed in both as-grown and hydrogenated samples after annealing at ~ 500 °C. These peaks were assigned to the LVMs of two O-H bonds associated to the same defect, labeled H-Z. The H-X defect is to our knowledge not reported in the literature. The H-Y and H-Z defects have previously been identified as OH-Ni_(Zn) and (OH) 2 -Cu_(Zn) complexes, respectively. However, the SIMS and IR absorption data presented in this work indicate that both these assignments should be revisited. The H 2 and/or D 2 gas anneals were also followed by a substantial drop in resistivity, which was found to be stable after annealing at 200 °C. The resistivity however increased markedly after subsequent annealing at higher temperatures (> 500 °C). The increased carrier density after hydrogenation is presumably caused by a combination of thermally stable H donors like HO and H passivation of acceptors present in the as grown samples, forming neutral complexes like OH-LiZn...|$|E
50|$|Previously, J. I. Pankove and {{co-workers}} at RCA put in considerable effort, {{but did not}} manage to make a marketable GaN LED in the 1960s. The principal problem was the difficulty of making strongly p-type GaN. Nakamura drew {{on the work of}} another Japanese group led by Professor Isamu Akasaki, who published their method to make strongly p-type GaN by electron-beam irradiation of magnesium-doped GaN. However, this method was not suitable for mass production and its physics were not well understood. Nakamura managed to develop a thermal annealing method which was much more suitable for mass production. In addition, he and his co-workers worked out the physics and pointed out the culprit was hydrogen, which <b>passivated</b> <b>acceptors</b> in GaN.|$|R

In undoped or Sb-doped CdTe and in undoped ZnSe, the PAC experiments indicate the compensation of Ag acceptors by the formation of double broken bond centres, which are characterised by an electric field gradient with an asymmetry parameter close to h = 1. Additionally, a very large electric field gradient was observed in CdTe, which is possibly connected with residual impurities...|$|R

40|$|The {{reactivation}} kinetics of <b>passivated</b> Mg <b>acceptors</b> in hydrogenated InP during unbiased annealing of a Schottky diode is reported. The reactivation {{is found}} to slow down gradually with annealing time and this phenomenon is attributed to substantial retrapping of H at the acceptor sites. It is found from the concentration profiles and the kinetics data that the reactivation is most likely limited by H 2 molecule formation processes for longer annealing times; for shorter annealing times, contributions from in-diffusion of H also become significant. The diffusion of H during the initial period follows an Arrhenius relation with an activation energy for the effective diffusion coefficient of 1. 13 ± 0. 10 eV. In the H 2 formation regime, the reactivation is thermally activated with an activation energy for the annealing parameter of 1. 71 ± 0. 10 eV. The H 2 formation-limited regime of reactivation occurs sooner as the annealing temperature is increased...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- The {{effects of}} {{hydrogen}} diffusion on p-n GaAs junctions {{have been studied}} by electron beam induced current (EBIC) and cathodoluminescence (CL) at room temperature. Hydrogen <b>passivates</b> both the <b>acceptors</b> in the p-side of the junction and the donors in the n-side of the junction. As a consequence the diffusion lengths increase, the surface recombination velocities decrease, and, finally, the CL intensity increases after the hydrogen treatment. The observation of hydrogen effects {{on both sides of}} the junction indicates that hydrogen diffuses at least in the neutral charge state.

40|$|Temperature-dependent Hall-effect {{measurements}} {{have been}} used to determine donor and acceptor concentrations and energies in n-type and p-type ZnO. Commonly observed donor energies in n-type material grown from the vapor phase (VP) are 35 and 65 meV, with the 35 -meV donor identified as H, and the 65 -meV donor, probably Al. Total donor concentrations in VP-grown material are as low as mid- 10 (16) cm(- 3). The only acceptors unambiguously identified so far in this material are the Zn vacancy, at the low- 10 (15) -cm 3 level, and substitutional No, at a higher level but evidently <b>passivated</b> with H. <b>Acceptors</b> that have been successfully used to create p-type ZnO by doping include N, P, and As, and resistivities as low as 0. 1 Omega-cm have been obtained.

40|$|Hydrogen {{is a key}} {{impurity}} in diamond {{since it}} is unintentionally incorporated in all chemical vapor deposition (CVD) grown diamond layers. Its presence in the material can grossly affect its electrical and optical properties. Theoretically, hydrogen has been predicted {{to be present in}} diamond in one of the three charge states, H, H and H. Moreover it may form complexesq 0 y with impurities, native defects or with other hydrogen atoms. This paper is comprised of two parts: (a) a review of previous results of studies investigating different aspects of the diffusion of hydrogen (deuterium) in various kinds of diamonds. The diamonds studied are: undoped type IIa diamonds, undoped CVD diamond layers containing growth defects only, p-type B-doped homoepitaxially CVD grown diamond layers or B ion implanted type IIa diamonds and n-type P doped homoepitaxially CVD grown diamond or N-doped type Ib natural diamonds. Hydrogen is introduced in diamond by exposing the diamond surface to hydrogen plasma or by using hydrogen ion implantation. The following issues are discussed: (1) the influence of the interaction between H and the dopants and defects on the hydrogen diffusion. (2) The kinetic of (B, H), (P, H) and (N, H) pair formation and dissociation. (3) The modification of the optical and electrical properties as a result of hydrogen incorporation and annealing. It is found that, under certain conditions, H diffuses into the B containing layer and it <b>passivates</b> B <b>acceptors.</b> In contrast, no H diffusion could be observed in n-type diamonds, up to 1000 8 C. (b) Recent results of our group regarding other aspects related to the diffusion of H in diamond are presented.

40|$|Following, {{a review}} of {{experimental}} techniques, theory, and previous work, the results of local vibrational mode (LVM) spectroscopy on hydrogen-related complexes in several different semiconductors are discussed. Hydrogen is introduced either by annealing in a hydrogen ambient. exposure to a hydrogen plasma, or during growth. The hydrogen <b>passivates</b> donors and <b>acceptors</b> in semiconductors, forming neutral complexes. When deuterium is substituted for hydrogen. {{the frequency of the}} LVM decreases by approximately the square root of two. By varying the temperature and pressure of the samples, the microscopic structures of hydrogen-related complexes are determined. For group II acceptor-hydrogen complexes in GaAs, InP, and GaP, hydrogen binds to the host anion in a bond-centered orientation, along the [111] direction, adjacent to the acceptor. The temperature dependent shift of the LVMs are proportional to the lattice thermal energy U(T), a consequence of anharmonic coupling between the LVM and acoustical phonons. In the wide band gap semiconductor ZnSe, epilayers grown by metalorganic chemical vapor phase epitaxy (MOCVD) and doped with As form As-H complexes. The hydrogen assumes a bond-centered orientation, adjacent to a host Zn. In AlSb, the DX centers Se and Te are passivated by hydrogen. The second, third, and fourth harmonics of the wag modes are observed. Although the Se-D complex has only one stretch mode, the Se-H stretch mode splits into three peaks. The anomalous splitting is explained by a new interaction between the stretch LVM and multi-phonon modes of the lattice. As the temperature or pressure is varied, and anti-crossing is observed between LVM and phonon modes...|$|R
