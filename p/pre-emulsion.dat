40|$|In {{this study}} {{the effect of}} the {{dispersed}} state of soy phosphatidylcholine on emulsification is investigated. The emulsifier is either dispersed in the aqueous phase (coarsely, as small vesicles, as large vesicles), or it is dispersed in the oil phase. Oil-in-water emulsions are prepared with the emulsifier present in the different dispersed states. High-pressure homogenization is used for the emulsification and the impact of pressure, number of passes through the homogenizer and emulsifier concentration is investigated by determination of droplet size and surface loads. <b>Pre-emulsions</b> made using a rotor-stator mixer have a smaller average droplet diameter when the emulsifier is dispersed in the oil phase than in the aqueous phase whereas the smallest droplets are obtained with small vesicles when high-pressure homogenization and repeated passages is used. Moreover, the droplet size can be significantly decreased by increasing the number of passages while an increased pressure has a smaller effect on droplet size. Hence, for a slow adsorbing emulsifier, repeated passages through the homogenizer may be more efficient since successive adsorption can occur. The surface loads, adsorption yields and emulsification efficiencies are observed to depend on the emulsification conditions and dispersed state of the emulsifier. The results from this study illustrates that the dispersion of the emulsifier may {{have a significant impact on}} emulsification and, hence, it may be important to consider the dispersed state of the emulsifier in order to achieve desired emulsion properties...|$|R

40|$|Core-shell baroplastics are nanophase {{materials}} that exhibit pressure-induced flow at low temperatures and high pressures. Core-shell baroplastics {{used in this}} work are comprised of a low Tg poly(butyl acrylate) (PBA) core and a high Tg polystyrene (PS) shell. These novel polymer systems can be molded into fully formed, 3 -D shapes with the application of high pressure at room temperature. While the mechanical properties are equivalent to or better than those of commercial thermoplastic elastomers, more {{can be done to}} improve upon individual aspects of the mechanical properties, such as elastic modulus. This work looks at creating baroplastic nanocomposites with the goal of improving upon the mechanical properties. To accomplish this goal, two incorporation strategies for introducing silica nanoparticles were developed. The <b>pre-emulsion</b> strategy incorporated hydrophobized silica nanoparticles inside the core-shell nanoparticles to create core-shell-shell nanoparticles. The post-emulsion strategy incorporated charged silica nanoparticles after core-shell emulsion, with the intention of creating crystalline structures with silica and core-shell nanoparticles. (cont.) The <b>pre-emulsion</b> strategy resulted in a decrease in particle size for the core-shell-shell nanoparticles, as shown by dynamic light scattering. Excess silica in the emulsion resulted in phase separation and opaque, brittle samples. Samples made with this incorporation strategy showed poor mechanical properties. The post-emulsion strategy also resulted in poor processing. SAXS data show that there is no long range ordering with the SiO 2 and core-shell nanoparticles. However, SAXS did show the possibility of a nanopcomposite with short range ordering of silica and core-shell particles. by Sheldon A. Hewlett. Thesis (S. B.)

Ted DavisHigh {{resolution}} cryogenic {{scanning electron microscopy}} (cryo-SEM) was used to study the physics of latex film formation. Fast freezing, controlled freeze-drying and annealing under vacuum, followed by room-temperature and cryogenic SEM demonstrated that van der Waals force alone can compact a latex coating under conditions devoid of surface tension and capillary forces. Rewetting tests of the annealed coatings shed light on distinguishing elastic and viscoelastic deformation. Key factors affecting the freeze-thaw (F/T) stability of polymer latexes were studied. The nanostructural changes during freeze-thaw cycles were visualized by cryo-SEM. Reducing Tg and modulus of the polymer, latex particle size, amount of protective functional groups, molecular weight and addition of coalescent all lead to reduced F/T stability. Both the freezing and thawing rates have strong impact on F/T stability. Both functional acid monomer type and degree of neutralization in <b>pre-emulsion</b> greatly influence {{the ability of the}} latex and titanium dioxide (TiO 2) particles to interact with each other which prevents TiO 2 particle aggregation.

40|$|Membrane {{emulsification}} is {{a process}} of injecting a pure dispersed phase or <b>pre-emulsion</b> through a microporous membrane into the continuous phase. As a result of the immiscibility of the two phases, droplets of the dispersed phase are formed at the outlets of membrane pores. The droplets formed in the process are removed from the membrane surface by applying cross-flow or stirring of the continuous phase or using a dynamic (rotating or vibrating) membrane. The most commonly used membrane for emulsification is the Shirasu Porous Glass (SPG) membrane, fabricated through spinodal decomposition in a melt consisting of Japanese volcanic ash (Shirasu), boric acid and calcium carbonate. Microsieve membranes are increasingly popular as an alternative to highly tortuous glass and ceramic membranes. Microsieves are usually fabricated from nickel by photolithography and electroplating or they can be manufactured from silicon nitride via Reactive Ion Etching (RIE). An advantage of microsieves compared to the SPG membrane is in much higher transmembrane fluxes and higher tolerance to fouling by the emulsion ingredients due to the existence of short, straight through pores. Unlike conventional emulsification devices such as high-pressure valve homogenisers and rotor-stator devices, membrane emulsification devices permit a precise control over the mean pore size over a wide range and during the process insignificant amount of energy is dissipated as heat. The drop size is primarily determined by the pore size, but it depends also on other parameters, such as membrane wettability, emulsion formulation, shear stress on the membrane surface, transmembrane pressure, etc...|$|E
40|$|Solid lipid {{particles}} (SLP) {{were introduced}} {{at the beginning}} of the 1990 s as an alternative to encapsulation systems such as emulsions and liposomes used in cosmetic and pharmaceutical preparations. The present paper investigated for the first time the preparation of SLP based on premix emulsification with packed beds of micron-sized glass beads. A coarse <b>pre-emulsion</b> was prepared by mixing the aqueous phase (water and Tween 80) and the lipid phase (Precirol and vitamin E) under magnetic stirring at 1200 rpm during 15 min, followed by passing the premix through the glass beads layer. SLP were formed by cooling to room temperature of the final emulsion. SLP were successfully produced under various conditions, but was most optimally carried out by extruding a coarse O/W emulsion 6 times under a pressure of 2 bar through a dynamic membrane. For example, when a 2 mm layer of glass beads sized 63 lm was used, the premix size of 5 lm was reduced to 1. 5 lm. It was found that particle size tended to decrease with increasing feed pressure, increasing number of passes, decreasing glass bead size and decreasing bed height. Even more importantly, the dynamic membrane was hardly prone to fouling compared to the membranes used in traditional cross-flow emulsification which typically need small pore size for the production of particles of similar size. In addition, the small beads could be easily cleaned by disintegrating the bed. The preparation process developed was easy to use, easy to scale-up, and the particle size could be controlled by appropriate choice of process parameters...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{membrane}} {{technology for the}} production of single and double emulsions has been proven feasible {{for a wide range of}} systems. The low energy requirements and mild process conditions (shear stress and temperature) of membrane emulsification (ME) compared to conventional processes makes it of interest {{for the production of}} emulsion-based foods. However, membrane fouling and low productivity are the main concerns preventing widespread application. Premix ME, in which a <b>pre-emulsion</b> is passed through a microporous system to reduce the size of the droplets, has much higher productivity than cross-flow ME (in which the droplets are formed in situ from the membrane/continuous phase interface); however, premix emulsification is more susceptible to fouling. This chapter reviews the different membranes and microporous systems used in premix ME to produce single and double food emulsions, and the effect of fouling on process performance and productivity is discussed. The influence of operational variables and emulsion formulation are related to the performance of premix ME, and scaling relations are presented. The use of premix ME to produce oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions has been mainly for vegetable oil/water emulsions stabilized with different surface-active agents. It has been shown that protein-stabilized O/W emulsions have lower fluxes than emulsions stabilized with small anionic or nonionic emulsifiers; the use of proteins, however, has been helpful to protect carotene-loaded emulsions against oxidation. Premix ME has also been used to produce water-in-oil-in-water (W 1 /O/W 2) emulsions, through homogenization of a W 1 /O emulsion in water. Although operation parameters, mainly related to the type of microstructured system (from inorganic membranes to microporous packed beds), can be set to produce stable W 1 /O/W 2 emulsions, encapsulation of a particular bioactive compound follows a case-study approach. <br/...|$|E
