5|$|A double-double {{is defined}} as a {{performance}} in which a player accumulates a double-digit number total in two of five statistical categories—points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocked shots—in a game. The most common double-double combination is <b>points</b> <b>and</b> rebounds, followed by <b>points</b> <b>and</b> assists. Double-doubles are fairly common in the NBA. During the 2008–09 season, 69 players who were eligible for leadership in the main statistical categories recorded at least 10 double-doubles during the season.|$|E
5|$|After the race, Häkkinen {{remained}} in the Drivers' Championship lead with 74 points. Michael Schumacher was second with 68 points, seven points ahead of Coulthard and nineteen ahead of Barrichello. Ralf Schumacher passed Fisichella for fifth place with 20 <b>points,</b> <b>and</b> Frentzen moved ahead of teammate Trulli and Salo. In the Constructors' Championship, McLaren maintained their lead with 125 <b>points</b> <b>and</b> Ferrari {{remained in}} second with 117 points. Williams increased their lead over Benetton to twelve <b>points,</b> <b>and</b> Jordan remained fifth with 13 points. Given Häkkinen's increased lead, Michael Schumacher acknowledged that his team lacked speed against McLaren in the season's four remaining races but remained confident of winning the world championship.|$|E

30|$|A final {{challenge}} in satellite communications is beam acquisition, <b>pointing,</b> <b>and</b> tracking. Longer links typically require more accurate <b>and</b> sophisticated acquisition, <b>pointing</b> <b>and</b> tracking systems {{to maintain an}} operational OW link, since the slightest error is magnified by the link distance. From a communication perspective, <b>pointing</b> <b>and</b> tracking are not only important for maintaining the optical link, but {{also contribute to the}} link power penalty since misalignment caused by <b>pointing</b> <b>and</b> tracking errors result in power fluctuations at the receiver [216 – 218]. <b>Pointing</b> <b>and</b> tracking errors are caused mainly by (a) satellite vibrations [218], (b) errors in the calculation of the point-ahead angle [4], and (c) beam wander effects [219]. <b>Pointing</b> <b>and</b> tracking errors may be reduced by using advanced automated control methods in the <b>pointing</b> <b>and</b> tracking element [4], while their impact may be dampened by allowing adaptive variations in the transmitted power [218] or a broader optical beam [220]. In earth-to-satellite communications <b>pointing</b> <b>and</b> tracking also suffer from fades in the atmosphere, and it is possible that re-acquisition of the beam is required after a fade, leading to extended capacity loss. Reference [221] discusses how inertial sensors can be utilized to counter-effect beam loss due to atmospheric fading.|$|R

5|$|Before {{the start}} of Yao's sophomore season, Rockets' head coach Rudy Tomjanovich {{resigned}} because of health issues, and long-time New York Knicks head coach Jeff Van Gundy was brought in. After Van Gundy began focusing the offense on Yao, Yao averaged career highs in <b>points</b> <b>and</b> rebounds for the season, and had a career-high 41points and 7assists in a triple-overtime win against the Atlanta Hawks in February 2004.
