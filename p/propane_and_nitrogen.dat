As stable combustion in LPM systems is somewhat intolerant to changes in operating conditions, precise engine tuning on a prescribed range of fuel properties is commonly performed to avoid dynamic instabilities. This has raised concerns regarding the use of imported liquefied natural gas (LNG) and natural gas liquids (NGL’s) to offset a reduction in the domestic natural gas supply, which when introduced into the pipeline could alter the fuel BTU content and subsequently exacerbate problems such as combustion instabilities.

Detonation was not observed both for the case of lean mixture case as well as when the dilution of nitrogen was increased beyond 25 %. In the case where the detonation was not observed, the tube experienced less acceleration rate, resulting in reduction of the impulse force.

40|$|Due to {{the threat}} of global warming caused by carbon dioxide {{accumulation}} in the atmosphere, the separation of carbon dioxide from other gases attracted much attention in the recent literature. Because of large surface areas and the possibility to modify the surface functionality, porous silica is regarded as a potential material class to contribute to solve this problem. Amino-functionalized porous silica was already used in various studies for carbon dioxide sequestration by adsorption as well as membrane separation [1, 2]. In this study, mesoporous glass membranes [3] were modified to enhance the CO 2 permselectivity. Controlled pore glass was chosen due to the adjustable pore size and the known adsorption potential for carbon dioxide and propane [4]. The prepared glass membranes were characterised by a narrow pore size distribution and inner surface areas between 40 and 100 m 2 /g, measured by low temperature nitrogen adsorption. Two pore diameters were set to approximately 12 and 8 nm. Approved surface grafting methods were used to functionalize the membrane surface. Three trialkoxysilanes (3 -Aminopropyl) triethoxysilane, [3 -(Methylamino) propyl]trimethoxysilane and (3 -Anilinopropyl) trimethoxysilane were grafted onto the membrane surface by reaction in toluene or water. Different concentrations of trialkoxysilanes were used to adjust the thicknesses of the grafted layers and therefore the surface concentrations of the amines. Adsorption isotherms of the adsorbable gases carbon dioxide and propane were investigated at different temperatures using a volumetric method. The amino-modification led to an increased adsorption of carbon dioxide due to the formation of carbamate species. Single gas permeation was conducted using the gases carbon dioxide, <b>propane</b> <b>and</b> <b>nitrogen</b> by a modified Wicke-Kallenbach-cell [4]. Since carbon dioxide and propane have the same molecular weight, observed selectivities can be ascribed exclusively to the different interactions with the surface of the membrane. Higher surface concentrations of the adsorbable gases can result in increased surface diffusion. This effect can be exploited to generate separation performances beyond the Knudsen selectivity. Nitrogen is referred as a nearly nonadsorbable, inert gas and as the main component of combustion gases. Therefore, the CO 2 /N 2 selectivity is a major criterion to evaluate the potential of possible membrane processes. Literature: [1] Knowles G. P., Graham J. V., Delaney S. W., Chaffee A.

40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} {{a complete}} coverage of theoretical and experimental approaches {{necessary for the}} development of the separation process of gases or vapours by the means of supported liquid carrier membranes based on ionic liquids (ILs). Firstly, state-of-the-art simulation software Femlab has been used for the mass transport modelling, where a simple mass transport model for facilitated transport through a liquid carrier membrane has been set up and implemented. For maximum separation performance of the membrane separtion unit it was found that the Gibbs free enthalpy for an exemplary carrier-permeant should be in the range from - 12 kJ/mol to - 18 kJ/mol. Secondly, quantum mechanical methods have been used and evaluated with the respect to the applicability for solving practical problems. It was found that quantum mechanical methods, which are computationally cheap enough in order not to be prohibitive for the treatment of realistic problems, can currently not accurately predict the exact thermodynamical behavior of carrier-permeant reactions. In spite of the limited applicability and deficiencies these methods, a few criteria could have been stated, by which a potential carrier among proposed chemical structures may be identified. The reaction typically should not show distinctive transition state barriers: 1. activation energy should preferably be less than 5 kJ/mol. 2. DFT methods propose favourable values of the reaction enthalpies for the potential carrier between - 100 kJ/mol and - 200 kJ/mol. It is in this range, where potential carriers should be searched for. In the last part membrane experiments have been focused. Surface tension and wetting influence the transmembrane pressures that can be applied to supported liquid membrane (maximum 12 bar). The pressures that can be applied to ceramic support that potentially enable scale-up of the membrane separation unit are, however in the range of 3 to 4 bar. The solubility of different gases (oxygen and nitrogen) and vapours (propylene and propane) has been investigated. It has been found that the solubility ratio of these vapours and gases behave no different than in other, more commonly used solvents. The solubility of propylene and oxygen is twice as high as that of <b>propane</b> <b>and</b> <b>nitrogen,</b> independent of the ionic liquid used. The solubility of gases and vapours in the membrane phase has shown a higher impact on the performance of the solution-diffusion liquid membranes than their diffusivity. Since the diffusion coefficients for propane and propylene as well as for oxygen and nitrogen are very similar, it was not surprising to find the experimental perm-selectivities and selectivities for these two separation problems around value of 2, which approximately correspond to the the ratio of the respective Henry’s coefficients. The selectivity in membrane permeation experiments decreases with temperature, because the gas/vapour solubility decreases with increasing temperature. The absolute fluxes are with maximum values of about 40 dm 3 /m 2 h bar rather small. This is due to the considerable membrane thickness, which could not be reduced. All attempts following the carrier approach in this thesis failed to give any satisfying results. The main reason is that classical carriers for propylene/propane separation (silver and cooper salts) have extremely low solubility in ionic liquids. A carrier for oxygen could be well dissolved in ionic liquid, however, it deactivated in the liquids phase, probably due to the carrier dimerisation or to strong coordination of the carrier’s active site...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} {{modification of the}} surface of known materials is an attractive possibility to enhance the properties of well defined structures. Besides the application {{in the field of}} catalysis the use of such modified materials in gas separation attracted much attention in the recent literature. The functionalization of surfaces, for instance with amine groups, was already used in various studies for carbon dioxide sequestration by adsorption as well as membrane separation [1, 2]. Because of large surface areas and the possibility to modify the surface functionality easily, porous silica is regarded as a potential material class to benefit from the {{chemical modification}} of its internal surfaces. In this study, mesoporous glass membranes [3] were modified with intend to enhance the CO 2 selectivity over N 2. Controlled pore glass was chosen due to the adjustable pore size and the known adsorption potential for carbon dioxide and propane [4]. The prepared glass membranes were characterised by a narrow pore size distribution, an average pore diameter of 5 nm and inner surface areas of approx. 140 m²/g. Approved surface grafting methods were used to functionalize the membrane surface. Various aminopropyl-trialkoxysilanes were grafted onto the membrane surface by reaction in toluene. Several substitutions of the amino-function were used to modify the basicity and steric hindrance of the amine-group in order to adjust the strength and quantity of carbon dioxide adsorption [4]. The amine content of the modified surface was furthermore adjusted by using modifying agents containing a higher number of amine groups such as ethylenediamine and diethylenetriamine groups. The success of the grafting procedure was examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Adsorption isotherms of carbon dioxide were investigated at different temperatures using a volumetric method. The amino-modification led to an increased adsorption of carbon dioxide especially at elevated temperatures due to the formation of carbamate species [5]. Single and binary gas permeation was conducted using the gases carbon dioxide, <b>propane</b> <b>and</b> <b>nitrogen</b> by a modified Wicke-Kallenbach-cell [6] in a transient and a steady state type of diffusion experiment, respectively. Since carbon dioxide and propane have the same molecular weight, observed selectivities can be ascribed exclusively to the different interactions with the surface of the membrane. Higher surface concentrations of the adsorbable gases can result in increased surface diffusion. This effect can be exploited to generate separation performances beyond the Knudsen selectivity. Problems arise if the adsorbed species loose their mobility on the adsorbents surface. Too strong adsorption suppresses the surface diffusion at lower temperatures and reduces observed selectivities to Knudsen ratio. For some modifications a shifting of the carbon dioxide selectivity towards higher temperatures was observed. This shifting might be useful in combination with the comparably high temperature stability of the inorganic membranes. Literature [1] Knowles G. P., Graham J. V., Delaney S. W., Chaffee A.
