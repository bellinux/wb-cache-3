40|$|Despite the {{implementation}} of supported employment programs and the assistance from supported employment specialists, people with disabilities continue to have lower employment rates than their non-disabled counterparts. Persons with psychiatric disabilities continue to have lower employment rates than people with visual disabilities and people with hearing disabilities. The purposes of this secondary analysis research study were to identify factors that distinguished those individuals with psychiatric disabilities who obtained employment while <b>participating</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> evidenced-based supported employment program from those individuals with psychiatric disabilities who did not obtain employment while <b>participating</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> evidenced-based supported employment program and to identify the variables that contributed to job tenure of people with psychiatric disabilities <b>participating</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> evidenced-based supported employment program. Participants were clients who <b>participated</b> <b>in</b> the Back to Work Program at St. Luke's House and {{were enrolled in the}} study for 27. 5 months. Univariate and bivariate analyses revealed that the only factor that distinguished those individuals with psychiatric disabilities who obtained employment while <b>participating</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> evidenced-based supported employment program from those individuals with psychiatric disabilities who did not obtain employment while <b>participating</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> evidenced-based supported employment was social security benefits. No variables were found to contribute to the job tenure for clients with psychiatric disabilities <b>participating</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> evidenced-based supported employment program. Due to the low enrollment rate, additional descriptive analyses were used and found interesting patterns for employment and job tenure for clients with psychiatric disabilities <b>participating</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> evidenced-based supported employment program. This study introduced the Social Cognitive Career Theory as a proposed framework to understanding employment for persons with psychiatric disabilities and their job tenures while <b>participating</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> evidenced-based supported employment program. Attachment to the labor market was used to expand how job tenure was measured. Limitations to the study, implications for Rehabilitation Counselors and Rehabilitation Counselor Educators, and future research suggestions were provided...|$|R
