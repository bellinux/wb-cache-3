5|$|On September 12, 1998, Willow Creek Transit Center opened {{along with}} the rest of the Westside MAX line. The <b>park-and-ride</b> lot was filled to 67% {{capacity}} on average within a few months of the MAX line's opening. In 1999, library officials proposed moving the Books by Rail program to the busier Willow Creek station, but the move did not occur and the program was later canceled due to reduced library funds and a failed library funding levy. By December 1999, Willow Creek was the second-busiest station in terms of boardings on the Hillsboro portion, averaging 2,313 per day. The <b>park-and-ride</b> lot was the fifth busiest on the MAX system by March 2000.|$|E
5|$|Planning {{began in}} 2003 for a parking {{structure}} to serve <b>park-and-ride</b> commuters at the station. Due to delays caused by disagreements with a property owner, {{the project was}} reduced to an expansion of an existing surface lot. Property to ensure a public access route to the station was acquired by the town in June 2016, allowing the parking expansion to proceed with projected completion in 2018.|$|E

40|$|As travel {{patterns}} shift {{and demand for}} public transit services increases due to congestion, drive-to-transit access patterns, such as <b>park-and-rides</b> (PNR), will remain a primary means of transit access for many regional residents and workers to avoid the monetary and time costs of traveling by automobile.

Works of public art included at several stations were developed as part of the RT Public Art Program, and represent an array of media including, mosaics, sculptures, metalwork and murals.

5|$|In 1983, {{the station}} was finally closed when Conrail and the newly formed Metro-North Railroad {{announced}} that the new stations along the Erie's former high speed freight line, the Graham Line, would take over freight and passenger service. Trains to Harriman would stop at a new <b>park-and-ride</b> built to the south. The former 1911 station depot, however, remained standing until 2006, when the Harriman village building inspector forced the new owners of the right-of-way for the old main line, Norfolk Southern, to either revamp or demolish the former station depot. The railway chose the latter, and in May 2006, a excavator tore down the 1911 depot, with the remains taken to a dump in nearby Hillburn.|$|E
5|$|Planning for a {{light rail}} system on Portland's west side started in 1979, with a {{groundbreaking}} coming in 1993 on the Westside MAX project. The line originally was to terminate at Willow Creek/185th, but lobbying by Hillsboro mayor Shirley Huffman and others secured funding to extend the line to downtown. Plans for the station originally called {{for the construction of}} a branch of the Hillsboro Public Library at the stop. Due to cost overruns when building the Robertson Tunnel through the West Hills, the library was canceled and a Books by Rail program was added to the Hillsboro Central station. TriMet also canceled plans for security cameras at the station. The <b>park-and-ride</b> lot opened on March 3, 1997, served by two bus lines (61 and 88), because it was ready for use. The original planned opening date of September 1997 for Westside MAX as far as 185th Avenue had been postponed by one year, due to delays in constructing the Robertson Tunnel, resulting in Willow Creek park-and-ride's being completed far in advance of the start of MAX service and related bus-service expansion.|$|E
5000|$|Flatiron Flyer is an 18 mi {{express bus}} system between Denver, Aurora, and Boulder, Colorado, {{traveling}} along U.S. Route 36. Different levels of service are available, including a non-stop from Boulder to Union Station in high-occupancy toll lanes (HOT lanes), and all-stop, which serves six <b>park-and-rides</b> along U.S. Route 36 in normal highway lanes. The line branches out to different destinations in Denver, Aurora and Boulder. The Regional Transportation District operates the line, opened on January 3, 2016. The ITDP classified {{the system as}} [...] "not bus rapid transit", due {{to the use of}} lanes shared with private cars along US 36, lack of street level boarding/alighting and the lack of an off-board fare system. [...] This new system has been criticized as bus rapid transit creep.|$|R
40|$|The Automobile at Rest: Toward Better Parking Policies in the Delaware Valley {{presents}} {{an overview of}} parking policies and requirements in the Delaware Valley region, along with strategies for managing and designing parking better. Each of the region's 353 municipalities set their own parking requirements within their municipal zoning ordinance, usually based on national standards from the Institute of Transportation Engineers and/or the Urban Land Institute. These requirements are detailed in a separately published Appendix titled Municipal Parking Standards Inventory. These standards often assume that all trips {{will be made by}} car and that destinations will be isolated and single use in character. The standards fail to recognize the different types of parking provisions that may be desirable or cost appropriate for different contexts, such as downtowns, suburban shopping districts, or rural areas. Municipal parking ordinances therefore often result in too much parking or requirements that are not flexible for mixed-use settings. These requirements have a strong influence on the built and natural environment and how the community grows or redevelops. The report also examines ways to reduce parking demand and improve parking supply where appropriate or necessary through parking management strategies, such as pricing, car-sharing, and shared parking, among others. Different types of parking are examined, from surface parking to underground parking to bicycle parking, along with innovative design treatments. The report also examines the environmental impacts of parking with a focus on the critical issue of stormwater. Lastly, the relationship between parking and transit is considered, particularly <b>park-and-rides</b> and transitoriented development. This report provides planners, local leadership, and citizens with information about best practices for designing, managing, and regulating parking...|$|R
40|$|The {{suburban}} terminus station dedicates {{large amounts}} of land for parking in order to cater to its driving riders, and causes a trade-off tension between attracting ridership through providing <b>park-and-rides</b> and building transit-oriented development (TOD) within station areas. I focus my research on the Millbrae Intermodal Station, a suburban terminus station in the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system, which is still waiting for {{a large amount of}} TOD to occur in its station area. The predominant research question for this thesis is: What are the challenges of creating TOD at suburban terminus stations and how can mixed use, highdensity, and human-scaled environments be better facilitated to become a reality? To answer this question, I took a mixed methods approach that included (1) evaluating ridership and parking supply data of all BART stations, (2) analyzing the primary and contextual case studies by comparing TOD plan documents to the current build-out reality of each station's station area, (3) conducting focused interviews with experts to gain insight on the barriers to implementing TOD at the Millbrae Station, and (4) developing a design proposition of how the Millbrae Station Area could engage alternative uses on its station parking lots. For all of the evaluated stations, parcels immediately approximate to the station had more difficulty realizing TOD than parcels further away from the station. Issues that surfaced as barriers to TOD included weak market conditions, land assemblage, construction costs, parking replacement standards, existing parcel ownership, and existing land use. In addition, TOD plans at more mature stations took an extensive period of time to become realized. To demonstrate how this inevitable waiting period could be more productive, I conclude by proposing design interventions and a strategy for how Millbrae, in the meantime, could apply and experiment with temporary flexible uses on its station parking lots. by Janet Wei Shih.
