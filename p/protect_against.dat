5|$|The {{protease}} {{targets of}} intracellular inhibitory serpins {{have been difficult}} to identify, since many of these molecules appear to perform overlapping roles. Further, many human serpins lack precise functional equivalents in model organisms such as the mouse. Nevertheless, an important function of intracellular serpins may be to <b>protect</b> <b>against</b> the inappropriate activity of proteases inside the cell. For example, one of the best-characterised human intracellular serpins is Serpin B9, which inhibits the cytotoxic granule protease granzyme B. In doing so, Serpin B9 may <b>protect</b> <b>against</b> inadvertent release of granzyme B and premature or unwanted activation of cell death pathways.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its close}} {{proximity}} to the sea, Jaywick had never been a practical place for farming due to the risk from floods; and the land remained unused. A sea wall was built in 1880 to <b>protect</b> <b>against</b> flooding. Ordnance Survey mapping around 1897 shows Jaywick as a few farmhouses near what is now Crossways on the Tudor estate.|$|E
40|$|Thioredoxin- 2 (Trx 2) is a multifunctional, mitochondria-specific protein, which {{inhibits}} cell death. The mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) is {{a distinct}} mechanism for cell death activated by oxidants and linked to both necrotic and apoptotic morphologies. We studied mitochondria from Trx 2 transgenic mice to determine whether Trx 2 <b>protects</b> <b>against</b> oxidant-induced MPT. All experiments were performed in isolated mitochondria. Results showed that Trx 2 <b>protected</b> <b>against</b> MPT induced by exogenously added peroxide. Unexpectedly, Trx 2 also <b>protected</b> <b>against</b> the MPT induced by Ca 2 + {{in the absence of}} added peroxide. The results indicate that in addition to <b>protecting</b> <b>against</b> oxidative stress, Trx 2 is an endogenous regulator of the MPT...|$|R

40|$|The {{three species}} of the genus Bordetella—B. pertussis, B. parapertussis, and B. bronchiseptica—have many antigens in common. Studies on {{representative}} strains of these species have shown {{that there are only}} a few specific antigens in each species. Whole-cell vaccines and extracts from B. pertussis contained specific mouse-protective antigen and a histamine-sensitizing factor. In addition, whole-cell vaccines and some saline extracts <b>protected</b> mice <b>against</b> intracranial challenge with B. bronchiseptica. Cells and a saline extract of B. parapertussis also <b>protected</b> <b>against</b> B. bronchiseptica but not against B. pertussis. Whole cells of B. bronchiseptica <b>protected</b> <b>against</b> B. bronchiseptica, but only one of three saline extracts <b>protected</b> <b>against</b> this challenge. Neither whole cells nor saline extracts from B. bronchiseptica <b>protected</b> <b>against</b> B. pertussis. The antigen in B. pertussis responsible for cross-protection against B. bronchiseptica was less resistant to heat than the protective antigen in B. bronchiseptica. Since histamine-sensitizing factor was not detected in B. bronchiseptica or B. parapertussis cells or extracts, this factor is not required to <b>protect</b> mice <b>against</b> B. bronchiseptica challenge. Whether B. pertussis vaccines <b>protected</b> <b>against</b> B. bronchiseptica by a nonspecific mechanism was not established, but it is clear that the specific antigen responsible for protection against B. pertussis was found only in B. pertussis and not in B. bronchiseptica or B. parapertussis...|$|R

5|$|Alarmed by {{the raids}} on St Nazaire and Dieppe in 1942, Hitler ordered the {{construction}} of fortifications all along the Atlantic coast, from Spain to Norway, to <b>protect</b> <b>against</b> an expected Allied invasion. He envisioned 15,000 emplacements manned by 300,000 troops, but due to shortages, particularly of concrete and manpower, most of the strongpoints were never built. As the expected site of an Allied invasion, Pas de Calais was heavily defended. In the Normandy area the best fortifications were concentrated at the port facilities at Cherbourg and Saint-Malo.|$|E

5|$|As bikinis leave most of {{the body}} exposed to {{potentially}} dangerous UV radiation, overexposure can cause sunburn, skin cancer, {{as well as other}} acute and chronic health effects on the skin, eyes, and immune system. As a result, medical organizations recommend that bikini wearers protect themselves from UV radiation by using broad-spectrum sunscreen, which has been shown to <b>protect</b> <b>against</b> sunburn, skin cancer, wrinkling and sagging skin. Certain sunscreen ingredients can cause harm if they penetrate the skin over time.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{barriers}} also <b>protect</b> <b>against</b> infection. The {{skin and}} respiratory tract secrete antimicrobial peptides {{such as the}} β-defensins. Enzymes such as lysozyme and phospholipase A2 in saliva, tears, and breast milk are also antibacterials. Vaginal secretions serve as a chemical barrier following menarche, when they become slightly acidic, while semen contains defensins and zinc to kill pathogens. In the stomach, gastric acid and proteases serve as powerful chemical defenses against ingested pathogens.|$|E

5|$|Fluoride {{therapy is}} often {{recommended}} to <b>protect</b> <b>against</b> dental caries. Water fluoridation and fluoride supplements decrease {{the incidence of}} dental caries. Fluoride helps prevent dental decay by binding to the hydroxyapatite crystals in enamel. The incorporated fluoride makes enamel more resistant to demineralization and thus more resistant to decay. Topical fluoride, such as a fluoride toothpaste or mouthwash, is also recommended to protect teeth surfaces. Many dentists include application of topical fluoride solutions as part of routine cleanings.|$|E
