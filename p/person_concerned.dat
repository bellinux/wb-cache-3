The ritual was conducted if somebody was stricken with illness or bad luck, when a Dongba priest would be consulted. On many occasions, the result would show that the person had carried out logging or washing of dirty things in the forest, and the family or <b>person</b> <b>concerned</b> would have to ask the Dongba priest to hold the ritual near where the activity had taken place, and apologise to the nature god Shu.|$|E

Here a clear difference can be seen to the situation of homosexuality. The psychological strain appearing in some individual cases is normally neither articulated nor acknowledged in public.

25|$|A person {{holding a}} {{high-ranking}} office within {{one of the}} highest classes of rank automatically received ennoblement for himself, for his wife, and for his legitimate children, and for decades this status was normally hereditable for his patrilineal and legitimate descendants. However, basically all such ennoblements were annulled when King Christian VI, tired of his father's generosity, acceded to the throne in 1730, and only those who received a special recognition after making an application retained their noble status. The office nobility as such was not abolished. Subsequent royal decrees introduced a more restrictive policy, under which noble status dependent on offices was limited to the <b>person</b> <b>concerned,</b> to his wife, and to his legitimate children.|$|E

500|$|Himmler further {{established}} the SS Race and Settlement Main Office (Rasse- und Siedlungshauptamt or RuSHA). He appointed Darré {{as its first}} chief, with the rank of SS-Gruppenführer. The department implemented racial policies and monitored the [...] "racial integrity" [...] of the SS membership. SS men were carefully vetted for their racial background. On 31 December 1931, Himmler introduced the [...] "marriage order", which required SS men wishing to marry to produce family trees proving that both families were of Aryan descent to 1800. If any non-Aryan forebears were found in either family tree during the racial investigation, the <b>person</b> <b>concerned</b> was excluded from the SS. Each man was issued a Sippenbuch, a genealogical record detailing his genetic history. Himmler expected that each SS marriage should produce at least four children, thus creating a pool of genetically superior prospective SS members. The programme had disappointing results; less than 40 per cent of SS men married and each produced only about one child.|$|E

500|$|The Whitsun festivals, {{suspended}} during Holst's absence, resumed at Dulwich in 1920. Joseph's part in {{this event}} is unrecorded, but she made a major contribution to the following year's festivities, which began beside the Thames at Isleworth and concluded on Whit Monday at SPGS in the gardens of Bute House. For the Monday's celebrations Joseph devised a presentation of Purcell's semi-opera from 1690, Dioclesian. Writing of the occasion after Joseph's death, Holst recalled that she had woven Purcell's music and Thomas Betterton's text, both long neglected, [...] "into a delightful out-door pageant founded on a fairy story, complete with lost princess, dragon and princely hero". Not satisfied with planning {{every aspect of the}} outdoor performance, Joseph prepared an indoors version of the entertainment, should the weather require this. The production was a great success, and was repeated that summer in Hyde Park and, [...] in October 1921, at the Old Vic theatre. Throughout this considerable organisational task, Holst wrote, [...] "Jane gave the minimum of worry to each <b>person</b> <b>concerned</b> by giving herself the maximum of hard work and forethought".|$|E
500|$|The Home Affairs Minister may, under Chapter IV of Part II of the ISA, {{order that}} any {{entertainment}} or exhibition be closed if satisfied if it [...] "is or {{is likely to}} be in any way detrimental to the national interest". Entertainment is defined by the Act as [...] "any game, sport, diversion, concert or amusement of any kind to which the public has or is intended to have access and in which members of the public may or may not take part, whether on payment or otherwise", while exhibition [...] "includes every display of goods, books, pictures, films or articles to which the public has or is intended to have access, whether on payment or otherwise". It is an offence to be the promoter of or a <b>person</b> <b>concerned</b> in the promotion of an entertainment or exhibition held or continued in contravention of an order requiring it to be closed, or the proprietor of the premises on which such an event is held. However, it is a defence to show that the event was [...] "promoted or continued without his authority, consent and knowledge and without any want of due care or caution on his part".|$|E

500|$|Assault is {{a summary}} offence in England and Wales, {{with the case}} heard only at a Magistrates' Court. Although R v Little {{considered}} assault a statutory offence, none of the statutes referred to contain any definition of assault. The actus reus, endorsed in R v Ireland, is any act by D that causes V to apprehend immediate and unlawful personal violence. The term [...] "force" [...] rather than [...] "violence" [...] {{is used by the}} Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). As a definition, this has proven stable, but its interpretation has varied. The force must be unlawful [...] outside the realm of defensive or preventative force, for example. Consent of the victim may be enough to prevent the commission of a crime. There is to debate as to whether lack of consent is an element of the actus reus, making it inherent to the commission of a crime, or whether consent is a defence. Andrew Simester and Bob Sullivan argue that the former is more correct, since lack on consent is vital to the crime; since the act may not constitute a harm even if enacted. The disregard for the victim's autonomy and privacy is the actionable part of the offence. The victim need not be frightened by the apprehension of violence, merely not want the <b>person</b> <b>concerned</b> to do it.|$|E
500|$|Fowzi Nejad was {{the only}} gunman to survive the SAS assault. After being identified, he was dragged away by an SAS trooper, who {{allegedly}} intended {{to take him back}} into the building and shoot him. The soldier reportedly changed his mind when it was pointed out to him that the raid was being broadcast on live television. It later emerged that the footage {{from the back of the}} embassy was coming from a wireless camera placed in the window of a flat overlooking the embassy. The camera had been installed by ITN technicians, who had posed as guests of a local resident in order to get past the police cordon, which had been in place since the beginning of the siege. Nejad was arrested, and was eventually tried, convicted, and sentenced to life imprisonment for his role in the siege. He became eligible for parole in 2005. As a foreign national, he would normally have been immediately deported to his home country but Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, incorporated into British law by the Human Rights Act 1998, has been held by the European Court of Human Rights to prohibit deportation in cases where the <b>person</b> <b>concerned</b> would be likely to be tortured or executed in his home country. Nejad was eventually paroled in 2008 and granted leave to remain in the UK, but was not given political asylum. The Home Office released a statement, saying [...] "We do not give refugee status to convicted terrorists. Our aim is to deport people as quickly as possible but the law requires us to first obtain assurances that the person being returned will not face certain death". After 27 years in prison, Nejad was deemed no longer to be a threat to society, but Trevor Lock wrote to the Home Office to oppose his release.|$|E
500|$|The first {{bill was}} {{presented}} to Parliament in 1829 by Henry Warburton, author of the Select Committee's report. [...] Following a spirited defence of the poor by peers in the House of Lords, it was withdrawn, but almost two years later Warburton introduced a second bill, shortly after the execution of John Bishop and Thomas Williams. [...] The London Burkers, {{as the two men}} were known, were inspired by a series of murders committed by William Burke and William Hare, two Irishmen who sold their victims' bodies to Robert Knox, a Scottish surgeon. [...] Even though Burke and Hare never robbed graves, their case lowered the public's view of resurrectionists from desecraters to potential murderers. [...] The resulting wave of social anxiety helped speed Warburton's bill through Parliament, and despite much public opprobrium, with little Parliamentary opposition the Anatomy Act 1832 became law on 1August 1832. [...] It abolished that part of the 1752 Act that allowed murderers to be dissected, ending the centuries-old tradition of anatomising felons, although it neither discouraged nor prohibited body snatching, or the sale of corpses (whose legal status remained uncertain). [...] Another clause allowed a person's body to be given up for [...] "anatomical examination", provided that the <b>person</b> <b>concerned</b> had not objected. [...] As the poor were often barely literate and therefore unable to leave written directions in the event of their death, this meant that masters of charitable institutions such as workhouses decided who went to the anatomist's table. [...] A stipulation that witnesses could intervene was also abused, as such witnesses might be fellow inmates who were powerless to object, or workhouse staff who stood to gain money through wilful ignorance.|$|E
