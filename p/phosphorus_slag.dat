In the paper, <b>phosphorus</b> <b>slag</b> was added into the glass-ceramics of CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 system. Through increasing the CaO content of CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 system glass-ceramics and keeping constant content of the <b>phosphorus</b> <b>slag,</b> the <b>phosphorus</b> <b>slag</b> glass-ceramics were obtained. The optimum compositions of CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 system <b>phosphorus</b> <b>slag</b> glass-ceramics was obtained through careful analysis based on X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and other measuring methods. The results showed that with increasing of CaO content, the leveling temperature, the crystal content and the densities of samples were gradually increasing, however, the leveling temperature range was gradually narrowing. When the content of <b>phosphorus</b> <b>slag</b> was 30 wt%, the addition of 17 wt%CaO was more reasonable. The main phase of <b>phosphorus</b> <b>slag</b> glass-ceramic was β-wollastonite.

Ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) was used as thestarting material to prepare slags pastes which were then activated with a range of activators. The preliminary results from the study of these pastes are presented. It was found that all the pastes show a significantlystrength loss after exposure to 50 °C for 24 hours. This is independent on the activators used. The paste samples were further examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential thermal analysis (DTA), scanning electronmicroscopy (SEM) and sorptivity tests.

He developed the process in 1875-77 together with his cousin. It involved melting pig iron in a converter similar to that used in the Bessemer process and subjecting it to prolonged blowing. The oxygen in the blast of air oxidized carbon and other impurities, and the addition of lime at this stage caused the oxides to separate out as a slag on the surface of the molten metal.

40|$|Coal-based {{reduction}} {{followed by}} magnetic separation {{is an effective}} way to recover iron from high phosphorus-containing oolitic hematite ore. Given that high quantities of dephosphorization agent are needed to obtain low phosphorus reduced iron, a novel approach is proposed by the authors. Without prior phosphorus removal, the phosphorus was enriched in the reduced iron during a reduction process, then high-phosphorus reduced iron was refined to low phosphorus molten iron and high <b>phosphorus</b> dephosphorization <b>slag</b> {{to be used as a}} phosphate fertilizer. The influences of various parameters, including the reduction temperature, the reduction time, and the C/O molar ratio, on the reaction behavior of phosphorus during reduction process were studied. Experimental results indicate that a higher reduction temperature, a longer reduction time, or a higher C/O molar ratio was favorable for the reduction of apatite to phosphorus and the enrichment of phosphorus in reduced iron. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis demonstrated that the apatite was reduced to phosphorus and Ca 2 SiO 4 (or Ca(Al 2 Si 2 O 8)) in the presence of SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3, whilst the phosphorus enriched in reduced iron formed Fe 3 P. The migration behavior of phosphorus was investigated using line scanning analysis of reduction products at different reduction times. The results show that the phosphorus primarily existed in the slag phase 10 min before reduction, and a large amount of phosphorus migrated into iron phase from slag phase with a reduction time of 40 min. The phosphorus content in the iron phase only slightly changed after 50 min. The pre-dephosphorization of reduced iron was performed at 1873 K, indicating a higher basicity or FetO content of CaO-based slag was beneficial to dephosphorization of the reduced iron...|$|R

CWs were filled with 2 cm diameter gravel, topped with 3 cm of compost, and planted with river bulrush (Schoenoplectus fluviatilis). Slag filters were filled with 2 - 5 cm diameter slag, having a porosity of 0. 42. From August to December of 2007 the six CW systems were fed with a pulse flow of dairy wastewater with a hydraulic loading rate of 1. 9 cm/day. This gave a nominal retention time of 10 days for each CW system. From May to September of 2008 the flow was changed to a continuous inflow, and resulted in a hydraulic loading rate of 3. 9 cm/day. A nominal retention time of 5 days for each CW system was calculated. Weekly monitoring was carried out for five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5), total suspended solids (TSS), ammonium (NH 4 +), dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), and pH. Integrated CWs and hybrid CWs were monitored for their ability to treat dairy wastewater. The analyses focused on determining if there were important differences in pollutant treatment efficiencies between the two distinct systems. Time series temporal semivariogram analysis of the measured water parameters illustrated that different treatment efficiencies existed {{in the beginning of the}} 2008 summer (early summer) compared to the end of the 2008 summer (late summer). Furthermore, the CWs were found to have significantly different (p-value 3 ̆c 0. 0001) treatment performances, in terms of TSS and BOD 5 removal, from early to late summer 2008. Integrated CWs remove significantly more DRP than hybrid CWs (p-value 3 ̆c 0. 05). During the late summer of 2008, the integrated CWs removed significantly more ammonium (p-value 3 ̆c 0. 05) then all other CW systems. Hybrid and integrated CWs were both efficient in removing organics, but the hybrid systems were significantly (p-value 3 ̆c 0. 05) more efficient during the period of highest macrophyte biomass. Mechanisms of pollutant removal in these CW systems were further analyzed. Ultimate BOD laboratory experiments were used to determine the maximum amount of biologically available organic matter and the corresponding rate constants for the removal kinetics of organic matter in the dairy wastewater. Geochemical modeling of the minerals that form on steel slag show that hydroxyapatite controls the activities of phosphate and calcium ions. The geochemical modeling results show a similar finding to field results, because as the wastewater:slag ratio decreases the pH increases (pH 3 ̆e 11) and phosphorus is removed...|$|R

40|$|In most cases, {{steelmaking}} slag and hot metal dephosphorization slag {{are in a}} solid-liquid coexisting states containing dicalcium silicate as the solid phase. From the phase diagram of the CaO-SiO 2 -P 2 O 5 system, {{it is well known}} that dicalcium silicate (C 2 S) and tricalcium phosphate (C 3 P) form a solid solution at the steelmaking or hot metal dephosphorization temperature in a wide composition range. This phase diagram implies that the main products of the dephosphorization reaction can be dissolved into the main solid phase in the slag.

In order to utilize the solid solution efficiently, the rate of phosphorus enrichment from liquid slag to the solid solution and the partition ratio of phosphorous between liquid slag and the solid solution should be clarified for various slag conditions.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} pressure to upgrade effluent ponds for <b>phosphorus</b> removal. Active <b>slag</b> filters offer a solution, but design information is limited. Hydraulic retention time (HRT) {{is a key}} factor in filter design because it controls filter treatment efficiency as well the filter substrate lifespan. This paper reports on a rapid method of continual looping of effluent through a filter column to obtain a relationship between HRT and phosphorus removal efficiency. Phosphorus removal declined logarithmically with respect to retention time. While the mechanisms that yield this relationship involve complex mass transfer and adsorption of phosphorus to Fe oxyhydroxide sites, in general terms, the adsorption rate is proportional to the adsorbate effluent concentration. Waste stabilization pond effluent treated by the <b>slag</b> achieved <b>phosphorus</b> removal efficiencies over 90 % at extended HRTs greater than 70 hours, while 80 % removal was obtainable in 30 hours. Higher phosphorus removal was achieved for slag treating real effluent compared with synthetic phosphate solution. This can be explained by: (1) different starting phosphorus concentrations in the synthetic phosphate solution and real effluent; and (2) the presence of constituents in real effluent that can enhance phosphorus removal, such as oxidized iron compounds, cations, algae and humic complexes. This new technique, which proved capable of replicating treatment efficiencies obtained from long-term column studies, offers rapid assessment of phosphorus removal efficiency as a function of retention time and thus will enable design engineers to size active filters on the basis of achieving the required phosphorus removal standards...|$|R
50|$|Spathic {{iron ores}} {{are rich in}} {{manganese}} and have negligible phosphorus. This led to their one major benefit, connected with the Bessemer steel-making process. Although the first demonstrations by Bessemer in 1856 had been successful, later attempts to reproduce this were infamously failures. Work by the metallurgist Robert Forester Mushet discovered {{that the reason for}} this was the nature of the Swedish ores that Bessemer had innocently used, being very low in phosphorus. Using a typical European high-phosphorus ore in Bessemer's converter gave a poor quality steel. To produce high quality steel from a high-phosphorus ore, Mushet realised that he could operate the Bessemer converter for longer, burning off all the steel's impurities including the unwanted phosphorus and the essential carbon, but then re-adding carbon, with manganese, {{in the form of a}} previously obscure ferromanganese ore with no phosphorus, spiegeleisen. This created a sudden demand for spiegeleisen. Although it was not available in sufficient quantity as a mineral, steelworks such as that at Ebbw Vale in South Wales soon learned to make it from the spathic siderite ores. For a few decades, spathic ores were now in demand and this encouraged their mining. In time though, the original 'acidic' liner, made from siliceous sandstone or ganister, of the Bessemer converter was replaced by a 'basic' liner in the developed Gilchrist Thomas process. This removed the <b>phosphorus</b> impurities as <b>slag,</b> produced by chemical reaction with the liner, and no longer required spiegeleisen. From the 1880s demand for the ores fell once again and many of their mines, including those of the Brendon Hills, closed soon after.|$|R

The work was carried out due to inconsistencies in literature on the phosphorus distribution between Si and <b>slag</b> and because <b>phosphorus</b> distribution between FeSi and CaO SiO 2 slag has not been previously been determined for silicon rich FeSi alloys. Calcia-silica slags of compositions 43 : 57, 50 : 50 and 65 : 35 in weight% (wt%) doped with approximately 300 parts per million(ppm) of P and Fe:Si alloys of compositions 20 : 80, 50 : 50, and 80 : 20 (wt%) have been prepared in induction furnaces. Equilibrium experiments were performed by holding metal and slag in a graphite crucible inside a furnace with resistance heating for 3 hours at 1600 °C in argon atmosphere. The samples were then quenched. After sample preparation, slag and metal were analyzed by Inductive Coupled Plasma Mass Spectroscopy. One experiment was also conducted with 20 : 80 wt% Fe:Si and CaO SiO 2 containing 5. 4 wt% P 2 O 5. After a holding time of 3 hours at 1600 °C, the sample was cooled {{at a rate of}} 1 °C per minute down to the solidification temperature of the metal (1360 °C). This sample was analyzed by Electron Probe Micro Analyzer. Equilibrium experiments with quenching showed that the phosphorus distribution coefficients between Fe 50 :Si 50 (wt%) and SiO 2 CaO slags were 0. 08 ± 0. 06, 0. 14 ± 0. 15 and 0. 53 ± 0. 42 for CaO contents of slag of 35, 50 and 57 wt% respectively. Experiments with Fe 20 :Si 80 and SiO 2 CaO slags gave values for the phosphorus distribution coefficient of 0. 14 ± 0. 15, 0. 13 ± 0. 3 and 0. 52 ± 0. 41 for CaO concentration in slag of 35, 50 and 57 wt% respectively. Between Si and CaO SiO 2 <b>slags</b> the <b>phosphorus</b> distribution coefficients were 0. 12 ± 0. 09 and 0. 4 for CaO concentration in slag of 50 and 57 % respectively. The main findings were that the phosphorus distribution coefficient did not change significantly with alloy composition. Slag composition on the other hand had a large impact on the phosphorus distribution coefficient. The phosphorus distribution coefficient increases with increasing basicity or CaO/SiO 2 ratio of the slag. Increasing the basicity also lead to increased calcium pick up in the metal which was consistent with published data. Thermodynamic modeling of the system should be conducted by including <b>phosphorus</b> in <b>slag</b> in the form of both phosphate and phosphide. The average loss of phosphorus after the experiment was 100 ppm. The use of graphite crucible most likely leads to the loss of phosphorus as P 4 in gas phase.

The partition of phosphorus increases with progress of refining but reduces during the intermediate period, corresponding to a decrease in iron oxide concentration and formation of “dry slag”. The phosphorus partition ratio increases again {{towards the end of the}} process. The equilibrium partition ratios for such conditions have been theoretically estimated using slag “model(s) ”, based on the estimated slag compositions. It is seen that the partition ratio of phosphorus remains within 45 % – 60 % of the equilibrium value, showing a gradual decrease with progress of the refining process. Equilibrium phosphorus partition ratios for slags containing low concentrations of MnO and Al 2 O 3 have been experimentally determined, over the ranges of basicity and iron oxide concentration approximately corresponding to that observed in the typical BOS process. It is seen that the equilibrium phosphorus partition ratio is practically independent of basicity greater than 2. 5 – 2. 6, over the entire range of temperature and FeOx concentration studied. Variation of the activity of P 2 O 5 with basicity and FeOx concentration has been investigated to explain the trends observed in the variation of phosphorus partition ratio. It is seen that the activity coefficient of P 2 O 5 is lowest, and hence most conducive for removal of phosphorus from steel, over certain finite ranges of basicity and iron oxide concentration. It follows that the efficiency of dephosphorisation is likely to be maximum if the basic oxygen steelmaking process is operated within these ranges. Simultaneous with this work, mathematical correlations have been developed for estimation of P 2 O 5 activity coefficient and phosphorus partition ratio as functions of slag composition. The correlations are compared with those proposed by earlier workers and are found to result in better predictions over certain composition ranges. QC 2010062...|$|R

The assessment is based on measurements of the radon release rate and activity concentrations of this PP-concrete. The study showed that for a typical Dutch crawl space dwelling with a concrete floor and with 30 foundation poles, the use of PP-concrete in the poles might lead to an extra effective dose between approximately 3 to 40 mu Sv a(- 1). This is, at maximum, about 4 % of the total effective dose (1 mSv a(- 1)) that inhabitants receive from their dwelling in the Netherlands...|$|E
40|$|In this study, metakaolin plus {{different}} {{weight percent}} of <b>phosphorus</b> <b>slag</b> (10 - 100 wt. %) {{were used in}} preparation of geopolymer. The compressive strength, phase analysis and microstructure changes were compared with a metakaolin based geopolymer control sample. Results showed that the substitution of slag up to 40 wt. % instead of metakaolin increase the 28 days compressive strength (14. 5 %) compared with control sample. This enhancement of strength is related to coexistence of geopolymeric gel and C‒S‒H gel or C‒A‒S‒H phase by XRD and FTIR study. In slag containing geopolymer samples some microcracks were observed at microstructure that established by volume change during formation of new phase or mismatching of unreacted particle with geopolymeric gel. These microcrack can dominate at high content of slag (above 40 wt. %) substitution and decrease the strength of samples. These results show {{that it is possible}} to produce geopolymer cement from waste phosphorus slages...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMineral {{carbonation}} technologies aim at permanently storing CO 2 into materials rich {{in metal}} oxides. A multi-step mineralization process employing Ca-rich waste streams to precipitate calcium carbonate is investigated in this paper. Ground granulated {{blast furnace slag}} (GGBS), <b>phosphorus</b> <b>slag</b> (PS) and steel slag (SS) were employed as feeding materials for the process. Solid to liquid ratio (S/L) {{is an important factor}} which affects mineral carbonation and this study examines its effect on the carbonation efficiencies. The main phases present in the carbonated residues were identified using XRF, XRD and SEM–EDS analytical techniques. For the three materials investigated, the carbonation efficiency increased when the S/L ratio decreased (from 50 g/L to 25 g/L and then 15 g/L) because of the dilution effect. In a previous study, where an analog process was employed, efficiency using serpentine was found lower than that calculated here for GGBS and SS, and slightly above PS. This confirms that, in general, waste materials require less energy-intensive carbonation conditions, in comparison to mineral rocks. Finally, the structure of the carbonated particles is also discussed...|$|E
40|$|This paper reviews {{progresses}} {{on the use}} of alkali-activated cements for stabilization/solidification {{of hazardous}} and radioactive wastes. Alkali-activated cements consist of an alkaline activator and cementing components, such as blast furnace slag, coal fly ash, <b>phosphorus</b> <b>slag,</b> steel slag, metakaolin, etc., or a combination of two or more of them. Properly designed alkali-activated cements can exhibit both higher early and later strengths than conventional portland cement. The main hydration product of alkali-activated cements is calcium silicate hydrate (Csingle bondSsingle bondH) with low Ca/Si ratios or aluminosilicate gel at room temperature; Csingle bondSsingle bondH, tobmorite, xonotlite and/or zeolites under hydrothermal condition, no metastable crystalline compounds such as Ca(OH) 2 and calcium sulphoaluminates exist. Alkali-activated cements also exhibit excellent resistance to corrosive environments. The leachability of contaminants from alkali-activated cement stabilized hazardous and radioactive wastes is lower than that from hardened portland cement stabilized wastes. From all these aspects, it is concluded that alkali-activated cements are better matrix for solidification/stabilization of hazardous and radioactive wastes than Portland cement. Peer reviewe...|$|E

Although they offer several economic, technical and environmental benefits, these secondary building materials contain various metals that may leach into river water. A leaching model was used to predict annual emissions of arsenic, cadmium, copper, chromium, lead, mercury, nickel and zinc. Under the current utilisation and model assumptions, the contribution of secondary building materials to metal pollution in Dutch surface waters {{is expected to be}} relatively low compared to other sources (less than 0. 1 % and 0. 2 % in the years 2000 and 2025, respectively). However, continued and widespread large-scale applications of secondary building materials will increase pollutant leaching and may require further cuts to be made in emissions from other sources to meet emission reduction targets and water quality standards.

The effects of both heat-treatment system and Na 2 O content on crystallization and microstructure were investigated by XRD and SEM. For the glass-ceramics with 15 mass% Na 2 O (A), Na 2 Ca 2 Si 3 O 9 appears initially at 850 degrees C, then the dominant beta-CaSiO 3 from 850 degrees C to 1050 degrees C, which further transforms into alpha-CaSiO 3 from 1050 degrees C to 1150 degrees C. The existing phases are alpha-CaSiO 3 and Na 2 Ca 2 Si 3 O 9 at above 1150 degrees C. For the glass-ceramics with 17 mass% Na 2 O (B), the primary and second phases are beta-CaSiO 3 and Na 2 Ca 2 Si 3 O 9 {{in the range of}} 750 degrees C- 950 degrees C, respectively. The transformation from beta-CaSiO 3 to Na 2 Ca 2 Si 3 O 9 occurs from 950 degrees C to 1050 degrees C. Na 2 Ca 2 Si 3 O 9 gradually transforms into Na 2 Ca 2 Si 3 O 9 solid solution from 1050 degrees C to 1150 degrees C, and Na 2 Ca 2 Si 3 O 9 solid solution becomes the predominant crystal phase above 1150 degrees C.
