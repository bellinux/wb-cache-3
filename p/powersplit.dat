Hydrid enlarged himself before the Voltech Bazooka could be used on him. With Sion handling the control systems, Shadow Alpha brought Hydrid into custody.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} year of the competition, the UWHVT {{developed}} an architecture that was a <b>powersplit</b> hybrid design. Technical papers were created at intervals throughout the year dictating decisions and results of simulations. It consists of a prototype traction motor, the 150 kW Continental AG Sapphire drive. A Weber MPE 750 engine (operating on E85) and the Delphi DU174 motor (found in the EV1) complete the genset. A clutch implemented in between the DU174 and the Weber allow for efficient all electric drive, while a clutch implemented in between the DU174 and the rear differential allows the Weber engine to be directly coupled to the road at highway speeds. Lastly, the battery pack located in the spare rear wheel compartment will be a Johnson Controls Saft 41Ah lithium-ion pack.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{electric}} {{variable transmission}} (EVT) offers a <b>powersplit</b> for hybrid electric vehicles by integrating two mo-tor/generator sets into one electric machine. This double rotor concept implements a {{continuously variable transmission}} between the engine and the driveline, including the possibility for electric propulsion. To guarantee good energy efficiency of the overall vehicle configuration, an integrated powertrain control (IPC) strategy is developed. First, optimization of the transmission ratio {{is analyzed by considering}} energy losses in the EVT. Next, an energy management strategy is presented incorporating the complete hybrid functionality of the EVT. Simulation results demonstrate feasibility of this IPC strategy and support the design process for optimal component specifications. I...|$|E

In this context, numerical modeling plays a fundamental role in predicting the performance of the vehicle transmission system and in optimizing its operation. A good design of the mechanical and electrical components of a hybrid transmission can be achieved only through an integrated approach. Regarding the hybrid electric traction, by means of the Ph.

40|$|Typically {{the energy}} {{management}} {{problem of a}} hybrid vehicle is formulated as anoptimization problem, where the optimal power split between the prime mover and the secondarypower converter is calculated o line based on a given driving cycle and solved numericallywith dynamic programming techniques. An important constraint is that the energy level ofthe secondary power source at the end {{is the same as}} in the beginning. In real live the futuredriving cycle is not known a priori, making it di cult to calculate the exact optimal <b>powersplit</b> beforehand. To arrive at a practical real time control algorithm, a sub-optimal controllaw can be applied, where the end-point constraint is replaced by a term in the cost functionthat accounts for the change in energy; in case of a hybrid electric vehicle it represents thefuel equivalence of the stored reversible energy. In this paper it is reasoned that the reversibleenergy contains also kinetic and potential energy of the vehicle as well as ener...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a framework to automate {{the process of}} designing Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) powertrain architectures. An algorithm was developed to assemble and compare all possible configurations of powertrain components. Combinatorics was used to discover all possible combinations of: an internal combustion engine, high-torque low-speed electric motor, low-torque high-speed electric motor, planetary gearset, and five-speed discrete gearbox. The Graph Theoretic Method was used to generate the powertrain models. The powertrain models were comprised of steady-state equations in symbolic form. An optimal control strategy is required to fairly compare the different topologies because a powertrain control strategy is dependant on the configuration. Dynamic Programming {{was used to determine}} the control law that minimizes the energy consumption for a given drivecycle. Evaluating every possible topology would take an extremely long time, so topologies were evaluated using a multi-stage screening process. The first stage examined the structure of the powertrain and used heuristics to eliminate infeasible topologies; 512 topologies were feasible. The second stage eliminated topologies that could not meet basic driving performance; 193 topologies were feasible. Basic driving performance was tested using a section of the US 06 drivecycle. The sizes of three components were optimized to ensure the topology is feasible independent {{of the size of the}} components. The third stage eliminated topologies which could not achieve driving performance design goals; 159 could achieve the performance requirements, but only 119 were reasonably fuel efficient. The driving performance goals were implemented with a drivecycle based on the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV) goals. The sizes for five components were optimized at this stage. The 20 most fuel efficient powertrains were selected for further evaluation. Additionally, 4 common powertrains were evaluated for reference. The size of the components were optimized for a combination of the PNGV drivecycle and the HWFET drivecycle. The most fuel efficient topology was found to be a <b>Powersplit</b> hybrid which has a discrete gearbox between the final drive and the <b>powersplit</b> device. The electric motor, planetary carrier gear, and gearbox were connected in parallel. It was found that Parallel-like, Powersplit-like, and Complex-like topologies were were the most efficient powertrain configurations. Powertrains containing two gearboxes were more efficient because the geartrain models ignored mechanical inefficiencies...|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of switched mode control to hydraulic systems {{has the potential}} of decreasing component complexity, size, and cost. This is accomplished by enabling variable pump or motor functionality using a single on/off valve paired with a compact, inexpensive fixed displacement machine. A 4 -way tandem rotary on/off valve is presented in this paper that extends a novel rotary valve concept (experimentally validated for pump applications) to hydraulic pump/motors. The pump/valve system is referred to as a Virtually Variable Displacement Pump/Motor (VVDPM) since the effective displacement of the system is variable and not the physical displacement of the pump itself. This paper investigates the design and efficiency of the proposed rotary valve when utilizing the VVDPM on a light weight <b>powersplit</b> hydraulic hybrid passenger vehicle that is driven over a standard federal drive cycle. Simulated VVDPM efficiency maps are presented for motoring and pumping and the cycle efficiency of an optimized VVDPM is compared to that of a typical bent axis unit. Vehicle fuel economy is also explored through simulation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Since {{hydraulic}} hybrid vehicles are power dense {{and do not}} require costly batteries, they {{have the potential to}} achieve high fuel economy and performance and at low cost. The three main classes of {{hydraulic hybrid}} architectures are series, parallel and hydro-mechanical (HMT) or <b>powersplit.</b> These architectures have intrinsic differences in transmission efficiencies and effectiveness in engine management. This paper compares the fuel economies and performance of these architectures and validates these features. Using a Toyota Prius like engine and chassis as common factors, fuel economies are compared for the “optimal ” design for each architecture which considers both the physical designs and the engine/energy management. Physical design variables include pump/motor sizes and gear ratios. The effect of pump/motors efficiencies, extra gears and different engine efficiency maps are also studied. To improve computational efficiency in evaluating fuel economy, engine operation is restricted to several operating modes and the accumulator pressure is assumed to be constant. These simplifications enable the Lagrange multiplier method to be employed so as to quickly determine the optimal engine management control and the resulting fuel economy for each design iteration. Full optimal control computations without the simplifying assumptions for the optimized design for each architecture (using dynamic programming) verify that, despite these simplification, the estimated fuel economies are close. It is shown that hybrid HMT offers the best fuel economy for various hydraulic efficiencies, followed by parallel and series architectures. However, the difference between HMT and parallel architectures diminishes if the engine has a wide efficient speed range of operation. It is also shown that an extra mechanical gear ratio can significantly increase fuel economy for all three architectures. I...|$|E

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV) are new {{generation}} Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEV) with larger battery capacity compared to Hybrid Electric Vehicles. They can store electrical energy from a domestic power supply and can drive the vehicle alone in Electric Vehicle (EV) mode. According to the U. S. Department of Transportation 80 % of the American driving public on average drives under 50 miles per day. A PHEV vehicle that can {{drive up to}} 50 miles by making maximum use of cheaper electrical energy from a domestic supply can significantly reduce the conventional fuel consumption. This may also help in improving the environment as PHEVs emit less harmful gases. However, the Energy Management System (EMS) of PHEVs {{would have to be}} very different from existing EMSs of HEVs. In this thesis, three different Energy Management Systems have been designed specifically for PHEVs using simulated study. For most of the EMS development mathematical vehicle models for <b>powersplit</b> drivetrain configuration are built and later on the results are tested on advanced vehicle modeling tools like ADVISOR or PSAT. The main objective of the study is to design EMSs to reduce fuel consumption by the vehicle. These EMSs are compared with existing EMSs which show overall improvement. x In this thesis the final EMS is designed in three intermediate steps. First, a simple rule based EMS was designed to improve the fuel economy for parametric study. Second, an optimized EMS was designed with the main objective to improve fuel economy of the vehicle. Here Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique is used to obtain the optimum parameter values. This EMS has provided optimum parameters which result in optimum blended mode operation of the vehicle. Finally, to obtain optimum charge depletion and charge sustaining mode operation of the vehicle an advanced PSO EMS is designed which provides optimal results for the vehicle to operate in charge depletion and charge sustaining modes. Furthermore, to implement the developed advanced PSO EMS in real-time a possible real time implementation technique is designed using neural networks. This neural network implementation provides sub-optimal results as compared to advanced PSO EMS results but it can be implemented in real time in a vehicle. These EMSs can be used to obtain optimal results for the vehicle driving conditions such that fuel economy is improved. Moreover, the optimal designed EMS can also be implemented in real-time using the neural network procedure described...|$|E
