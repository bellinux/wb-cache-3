5|$|Bupropion {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely {{prescribed}} antidepressants, and the available evidence indicates that it is effective in clinical depression — as effective as several other widely prescribed drugs, including fluoxetine (Prozac) and <b>paroxetine</b> (Paxil), although trends favoring the efficacy of escitalopram (Lexapro), sertraline (Zoloft) and venlafaxine (Effexor) over bupropion have been observed. Mirtazapine (Remeron), on the other hand is significantly more effective than bupropion. Bupropion has several features that distinguish it from other antidepressants: for instance, unlike the majority of antidepressants, it does not usually cause sexual dysfunction. Bupropion treatment also is not associated with the sleepiness or weight gain that may be produced by other antidepressants.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid is a weak {{monoamine oxidase}} {{inhibitor}} (MAOI), {{and should not}} be used concomitantly with other MAOIs, large amounts of tyramine-rich foods (such as pork, aged cheeses, alcoholic beverages, or smoked and pickled foods), or serotonergic drugs. There have been postmarketing reports of serotonin syndrome when linezolid was given with or soon after the discontinuation of serotonergic drugs, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as <b>paroxetine</b> and sertraline. It may also enhance the blood pressure-increasing effects of sympathomimetic drugs such as pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine. It should also not be given in combination with pethidine (meperidine) under any circumstance due to the risk of serotonin syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Since {{bupropion}} is metabolized to hydroxybupropion by the CYP2B6 enzyme, {{drug interactions}} with CYP2B6 inhibitors are possible: this includes medications like <b>paroxetine,</b> sertraline, fluoxetine, diazepam, clopidogrel, and orphenadrine. The expected {{result is the}} increase of bupropion and decrease of hydroxybupropion blood concentration. The reverse effect (decrease of bupropion and increase of hydroxybupropion) can be expected with CYP2B6 inducers, such as carbamazepine, clotrimazole, rifampicin, ritonavir, St John's wort, phenobarbital, phenytoin and others. Conversely, because bupropion is itself a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (Ki = 21μM), as is its active metabolite, hydroxybupropion (Ki = 13.3μM), it can slow the clearance of other drugs metabolized by this enzyme. As an example, the ratio of dextromethorphan (a drug that is mainly metabolized by CYP2D6) to its major metabolite dextrorphan increased approximately 35-fold when it was administered to people being treated with 300mg/day bupropion, indicative of a major drug interaction with a common over-the-counter medicine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Paroxetine</b> {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Comparative efficacy of <b>paroxetine</b> is equivalent to that of clomipramine and venlafaxine. <b>Paroxetine</b> is also effective for children with obsessive-compulsive disorder.|$|E
25|$|<b>Paroxetine</b> is {{the most}} potent SSRI drug available, but it is less {{selective}} for SERT than fluvoxamine and sertraline. <b>Paroxetine</b> also has weak NET inhibition which could contribute to its efficacy in depression, especially at higher doses. As demonstrated in table 2, <b>paroxetine</b> also inhibits the NOSs enzyme which could be the reason for its sexual dysfunction adverse effect, especially in men. <b>Paroxetine</b> shows the highest affinity for muscarinic receptors of all the SSRIs which results in weak anticholinergic activity and therefore undesirable adverse effects.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} meta {{analyses}} {{have been conducted}} to evaluate the efficacy of <b>paroxetine</b> in depression. They have variously concluded that <b>paroxetine</b> is superior or equivalent to placebo {{and that it is}} equivalent or inferior to other antidepressants. Despite this, there was no clear evidence that <b>paroxetine</b> was better or worse compared with other antidepressants at increasing response to treatment at any time point.|$|E
25|$|Like other antidepressants, <b>paroxetine</b> may {{increase}} the risk of suicidal thinking and behaviour in children and adolescents. The FDA conducted a statistical analysis of <b>paroxetine</b> clinical trials in children and adolescents in 2004 and found an increase in suicidality and ideation as compared to placebo, which was observed in trials for both depression and anxiety disorders. In 2015 a paper published in The BMJ that reanalysed the original case notes argued that in Study 329, assessing <b>paroxetine</b> and imipramine against placebo in adolescents with depression, the incidence of suicidal behavior had been under-reported and the efficacy exaggerated for <b>paroxetine.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Paroxetine</b> was {{the first}} {{antidepressant}} formally approved in the United States {{for the treatment of}} panic disorder. Several studies have concluded that <b>paroxetine</b> is superior to placebo in the treatment of panic disorder.|$|E
25|$|After a {{screening}} phase from April 1994, 275 {{male and female}} patients were randomly assigned <b>paroxetine,</b> imipramine or placebo (an inert pill). Of the 275, 93 were given <b>paroxetine,</b> 95 imipramine and 89 placebo. The <b>paroxetine</b> group were given 20mg daily for four weeks, rising to 30mg at week five and 40mg at week six if the clinician thought it appropriate. The last study visit was in May 1997, and the blind was broken in October.|$|E
25|$|Most {{cases of}} {{discontinuation}} syndrome last {{between one and}} four weeks, are relatively mild, and resolve on their own; in rare cases symptoms can be severe or extended. <b>Paroxetine</b> and venlafaxine seem to be particularly difficult to discontinue and prolonged withdrawal syndrome lasting over 18 months have been reported with <b>paroxetine.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{analysis}} {{suggested an}} increased rate of suicidal thinking and behaviour of 3.4 percent on <b>paroxetine</b> versus 1.2 percent on placebo. The committee {{concluded that the}} risks outweighed the benefits, and on 10 June 2003 issued an advisory to physicians not to prescribe <b>paroxetine</b> to the under-18s. The US Food and Drug Administration followed suit nine days later.|$|E
25|$|Study 329 was a {{clinical}} trial conducted in North America from 1994 to 1998 to study the efficacy of <b>paroxetine,</b> an SSRI anti-depressant, in treating 12- to 18-year-olds diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Led by Martin Keller, then {{professor of psychiatry at}} Brown University, and funded by the British pharmaceutical company SmithKline Beecham—known since 2000 as GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)—the study compared <b>paroxetine</b> with imipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, and placebo (an inert pill). SmithKline Beecham had released <b>paroxetine</b> in 1991, marketing it as Paxil in North America and Seroxat in the UK. The drug attracted sales of $11.7billion in the United States alone from 1997 to 2006, including $2.12billion in 2002, the year before it lost its patent.|$|E
25|$|Jofre's {{interest}} in <b>paroxetine</b> {{was triggered by}} the July 2001 case of Timothy J. Tobin v. SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals in the United States. The family of 60-year-old Donald Schell sued the company after Schell shot and killed his wife, daughter and baby granddaughter, then committed suicide, 48 hours after starting a course of <b>paroxetine</b> in 1998. A Wyoming jury awarded the plaintiffs $6.4 million.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{studies suggest}} that taking the {{selective}} serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) antidepressants <b>paroxetine</b> (Paxil), fluoxetine (Prozac), and sertraline (Zoloft) can decrease the effectiveness of tamoxifen, as these drugs compete for the CYP2D6 enzyme which is needed to metabolize tamoxifen into its active forms. A U.S. study presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual meeting in 2009 found that after two years, 7.5% of women who took only tamoxifen had a recurrence, compared with 16% who took either <b>paroxetine,</b> fluoxetine or sertraline, drugs {{considered to be the}} most potent CYP2D6 inhibitors. That difference translates to a 120% increase in {{the risk of breast cancer}} recurrence. Patients taking the SSRIs; Celexa (citalopram), Lexapro (escitalopram), and Luvox (fluvoxamine), did not have an increased risk of recurrence, due to their lack of competitive metabolism for the CYP2D6 enzyme. A newer study demonstrated a clearer and stronger effect from <b>paroxetine</b> in causing the worst outcomes. Patients treated with both <b>paroxetine</b> and tamoxifen have a 67% increased risk of death from breast cancer, from 24% to 91%, depending on the duration of coadministration.|$|E
25|$|It has {{a similar}} {{tolerability}} profile to other SSRIs. The common side effects include drowsiness, dry mouth, loss of appetite, sweating, trouble sleeping and delayed ejaculation. It may also {{be associated with a}} slightly increased risk of birth defects. The rate of withdrawal symptoms in young people may be higher with <b>paroxetine</b> and venlafaxine than other SSRIs and SNRIs. Several studies have associated <b>paroxetine</b> with suicidal thinking and behavior in children and adolescents.|$|E
25|$|Netherlands: In the Netherlands, <b>paroxetine,</b> {{marketed as}} Seroxat among generic preparations, {{is the most}} {{prescribed}} antidepressant, followed by amitriptyline, citalopram and venlafaxine.|$|E
25|$|The paper {{suggested}} a label change regarding withdrawal symptoms, which it said had occurred with <b>paroxetine</b> at roughly {{twice the rate}} of placebo.|$|E
25|$|The JAACAP {{article on}} study 329 was never retracted. The journal's editors say the {{negative}} findings {{are included in}} a table, and that therefore there are no grounds to withdraw the article. In September 2015 the BMJ published a re-analysis of the study. This concluded that neither <b>paroxetine</b> nor imipramine had differed in efficacy from placebo in treating depression, that the <b>paroxetine</b> group had experienced more suicidal ideation and behaviour, and that the imipramine group had experienced more cardiovascular problems.|$|E
25|$|GSK {{used the}} JAACAP article to promote <b>paroxetine</b> to doctors {{for use in}} their teenage patients. The drug had not been {{approved}} for use in children and adolescents. Drug companies are prohibited from promoting drugs for unapproved uses, but doctors are permitted to prescribe drugs for {{what is known as}} off-label use. In the UK 32,000 prescriptions of <b>paroxetine</b> were written for children and adolescents in 1999, and in the US that figure rose to 2.1 million in 2002, earning GSK $55million.|$|E
25|$|Evidence is {{insufficient}} to {{support the use of}} medications to treat obstructive sleep apnea. This includes the use of fluoxetine, <b>paroxetine,</b> acetazolamide and tryptophan among others.|$|E
25|$|<b>Paroxetine</b> is a {{constrained}} structural analogue of fluoxetine {{where the}} linear phenylpropylamine group of fluoxetine has been folded into a piperidine ring (figure 5). The compound has {{the possibility of}} four stereoisomers because it contains two chiral centers, but one of them, the (3S,4R)-isomer, is marketed as <b>paroxetine.</b> Research has shown that stereochemical factors affect affinity of the molecule for SERT where substitution into the 2-ortho-position of either aromatic rings decreases affinity for rat SERT {{by as much as}} 10–100 times, where the greatest loss occurs in the phenoxy ring.|$|E
25|$|<b>Paroxetine</b> is {{primarily}} {{used to treat}} major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder and menopausal hot flashes.|$|E
25|$|A meta-analysis, {{including}} {{studies with}} fluoxetine, <b>paroxetine,</b> sertraline, escitalopram, and citalopram versus placebo, showed SSRIs {{to be effective}} in reducing symptoms of premenstrual syndrome, whether taken continuously or just in the luteal phase.|$|E
25|$|Some of the SSRIs and SNRIs {{appear to}} provide some relief. Low dose <b>paroxetine</b> has been FDA-approved for hot moderate-to-severe vasomotor {{symptoms}} associated with menopause. They may, however, be associated with sleeping problems.|$|E
25|$|Comparative {{clinical}} trials demonstrated that sertraline {{is similar in}} efficacy against depression to moclobemide, nefazodone, escitalopram, bupropion, citalopram, fluvoxamine, <b>paroxetine,</b> and mirtazapine. There is low quality evidence that sertraline is more efficacious {{for the treatment of}} depression than fluoxetine.|$|E
25|$|People {{stopping}} venlafaxine commonly experience discontinuation {{symptoms such as}} dysphoria, headaches, nausea, irritability, emotional lability, {{sensation of}} electric shocks, and sleep disturbance. Venlafaxine has {{a higher rate of}} moderate to severe discontinuation symptoms relative to other antidepressants (similar to the SSRI <b>paroxetine).</b>|$|E
25|$|Changes in {{appetite}} or weight {{are common}} among antidepressants, but largely drug-dependent and {{are related to}} which neurotransmitters they affect. Mirtazapine and <b>paroxetine,</b> for example, {{have the effect of}} weight gain and/or increased appetite, while others (such as bupropion and venlafaxine) achieve the opposite effect.|$|E
25|$|Atomoxetine is a {{substrate}} for CYP2D6. Concurrent {{treatment with}} a CYP2D6 inhibitor such as bupropion, fluoxetine, or <b>paroxetine</b> {{has been shown}} to increase plasma atomoxetine by 100% or more, as well as increase N-desmethylatomoxetine levels and decrease plasma 4-hydroxyatomoxetine levels by a similar degree.|$|E
25|$|A 2007 {{review of}} books {{relating}} to major depressive disorder, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, discussing in particular fluoxetine (Prozac) and <b>paroxetine</b> (Paxil) {{as part of a}} lengthy essay on the relationship between pharmaceutical companies, academic psychiatry and psychiatrists and the United States Food and Drug Administration.|$|E
25|$|A {{meta-analysis}} on SSRIs and SNRIs {{that look}} at partial response (defined {{as at least}} a 50% reduction in depression score from baseline) found that sertraline, <b>paroxetine</b> and duloxetine were better than placebo. With respect to safety duloxetine and venlafaxine increased worsened dizziness, however not much safety data was reported.|$|E
25|$|<b>Paroxetine</b> has {{demonstrated}} efficacy {{for the treatment}} of social anxiety disorder in adults and children. There was a significant improvement in scores on the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale and Social Phobia Inventory compared with placebo. It is also beneficial for people with co-occurring social anxiety disorder and alcohol use disorder.|$|E
25|$|Aripiprazole is a {{substrate}} of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Coadministration with {{medications that}} inhibit (e.g. <b>paroxetine,</b> fluoxetine) or induce (e.g. carbamazepine) these metabolic enzymes {{are known to}} increase and decrease, respectively, plasma levels of aripiprazole. As such, anyone taking aripiprazole {{should be aware that}} their dosage of aripiprazole may need to be adjusted.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there is}} little {{evidence}} of abnormality in serotonin neurotransmission, the limited efficacy of medications which affect serotonin levels may indicate the role of this pathway. <b>Paroxetine</b> and sertraline are two SSRIs that have been confirmed by the FDA to treat social anxiety disorder. Some researchers believe that SSRIs decrease the activity of the amygdala.|$|E
25|$|While some substitutive pharmacotherapies {{may have}} promise, current {{evidence}} is insufficient to support their use. Some studies found that the abrupt substitution of substitutive pharmacotherapy was actually less effective than gradual dose reduction alone, and only three studies found benefits of adding either melatonin, <b>paroxetine,</b> or trazodone and valproate {{in conjunction with a}} gradual dose reduction.|$|E
25|$|In February 2003 the MHRA's Committee on the Safety of Medicines (CSM) {{set up an}} Expert Working Group to {{investigate}} SSRIs and safety. In preparation for its first meeting, the MHRA met GSK on 21 May 2003 {{to make sure that}} GSK had supplied all information relevant to <b>paroxetine</b> and safety, and to discuss Jofre's second Panorama programme.|$|E
25|$|In June 2004 New York State Attorney Eliot Spitzer filed {{a lawsuit}} against GSK in the New York State Supreme Court for having {{withheld}} clinical trial data about <b>paroxetine,</b> including from study 329. GSK denied any wrongdoing and said it had disclosed the data to regulators, and to physicians at medical conventions and in other ways.|$|E
