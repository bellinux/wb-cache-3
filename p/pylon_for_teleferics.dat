50|$|The idea to use Egyptian <b>Pylons</b> <b>for</b> the {{supports}} of {{a suspension}} appears first {{to have been}} applied by Thomas Telford for the Menai Bridge. This was started in 1819 and completed in 1826.|$|R

5000|$|Z-11WB: New attack/reconnaissance variant {{based on}} the AC-311 with a new EO ball, {{redesigned}} cockpit, SW-6 UAV, and <b>pylons</b> <b>for</b> weapons.

50|$|Rohr's {{main product}} line are aerostructures, such as engine-related components, {{including}} engine nacelles, thrust reversers, and mounting <b>pylons</b> <b>for</b> military and commercial aircraft. It also consults on integrating and managing its designs {{with the other}} aircraft systems.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A {{concrete}} {{girder bridge}} pier during construction prior to {{installation of the}} bridge deck and parapets, consisting of multiple angled <b>pylons</b> <b>for</b> support (bottom), a horizontal concrete cap (center), and girders (top) with temporary wood bracing ...|$|R
50|$|The largest <b>pylons</b> <b>for</b> {{the bridge}} consist of diamond shaped 128 m high {{concrete}} tower featuring flaring lower legs, converging upper legs, a unified tower head housing the stays and a continuously varying cross section along {{the height of}} tower.|$|R
50|$|Overhead line {{crossings}} of valleys consist of two anchor pylons, one {{at either end}} of the valley. If the topography of the valley is suitable, these do not need to be very high. In very wide valleys, it is better to use a <b>pylon</b> <b>for</b> each phase in order to achieve sufficient distance between the conductors. In these cases there is frequently a further anchor pylon behind the crossing, used in order to realize the angle change of the conductor cables behind these. The problems associated with large spans also exist in these cases, but these can be easily and economically ameliorated, if the topography does not require high crossing pylons, by using a separate <b>pylon</b> <b>for</b> each conductor.|$|R
5|$|The Jaguar International had {{the unusual}} {{optional}} provision <b>for</b> overwing <b>pylons,</b> used <b>for</b> short-range air-to-air missiles, {{such as the}} Matra R550 Magic or the AIM-9 Sidewinder. This option frees up the under-wing <b>pylons</b> <b>for</b> other weapons and stores. RAF Jaguars gained overwing pylons in the buildup to Operation Granby in 1990, but French Jaguars were not modified. The RAF's Jaguar 97s were intended to be wired for the carriage of ASRAAMs on the overwing launchers, but clearance of this weapon was never completed because of funding cuts.|$|R
25|$|Sauber had {{introduced}} separate <b>pylons</b> <b>for</b> {{each of the}} front suspension mounts on their previous car, the C19. For the C20, the area between {{the front and back}} mounting points on each side was filled in, creating two longitudinal keels running underneath the sides of the nose.|$|R
50|$|Between 1949 and 1951, {{renovation}} of the bridge {{was carried out by}} the work train №417. On the cutwater side of the piers, <b>pylons</b> <b>for</b> a second track were erected; these were surmounted by unified span structures (designed by Proektstalkonstruktsia in 1944 for class N-7 loads).|$|R

50|$|Thomas Smith Tait (1882-1954) was a {{prominent}} Scottish modernist architect. He designed a number of buildings {{around the world in}} Art Deco and Streamline Moderne styles, notably St. Andrew's House (the headquarters of the Scottish Government) on Calton Hill, Edinburgh, and the <b>pylons</b> <b>for</b> Sydney Harbour Bridge.|$|R
