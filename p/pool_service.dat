40|$|Abstract. Service-oriented {{workflows}} are {{the fundamental}} structures in service-oriented applications {{and changes in}} the workflow could cause dramatic changes in system reliability. In several ways to re-heal workflows in execution, re-sizing <b>service</b> <b>pools</b> in the workflow is practical and easy to implement. In order to quickly adjust to workflow or environmental changes, this paper presents a dynamic <b>service</b> <b>pool</b> size configuration mechanism {{from the point of view}} of maintaining workflow reliability. An architecture-based reliability model is used to evaluate the overall reliability of a workflow with <b>service</b> <b>pools</b> and an optimal method is proposed to get the combination of <b>service</b> <b>pool</b> size aiming at minimizing the sum of <b>service</b> <b>pool</b> size subject to the workflow reliability requirement. A case study is used to explain this method and experiment results show how to change <b>service</b> <b>pool</b> size to meet the workflow reliability requirements...|$|R

50|$|San Marino {{is highly}} {{restrictive}} of commercial {{operations in the}} city. It {{is one of the}} few cities that requires commercial vehicles to have permits to work within the city.

This regulation and others, including the bans on apartment buildings, townhouses and overnight parking, are some of the more obvious examples.|$|E
