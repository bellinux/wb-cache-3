Raman and X-ray absorption spectroscopies were used to probe the structure of these MoOx domains, as they evolved from monomeric species into two-dimensional <b>polymolybdate</b> domains and MoO 3 clusters with increasing MoOx surface density. Primary HCHO synthesis rates (per Mo atom) initially increased with increasing MoOx surface density (1. 5 – 7 Mo/nm 2) on all supports, indicating that MoOx domain surfaces become more active as two-dimensional monolayers form via oligomerization of monomer species. The incipient formation of MoO 3 clusters at higher surface densities led to inaccessible MoOx species and to lower HCHO synthesis rates (per Mo). Areal rates reached constant values as <b>polymolybdate</b> monolayers formed. These areal rates depend on the identity of the support; they were highest on SnO 2, lowest on Al 2 O 3, and undetectable on MgO, indicating that the surface properties of <b>polymolybdate</b> structures are strongly influenced by their atomic attachment to a specific support. The catalytic behavior of MoOx domains reflects their ability to delocalize electron density during the formation of transition states required for rate-determining C–H bond activation steps within redox cycles involved in HCHO synthesis from dimethyl ether. These conclusions are consistent with the observed parallel increase in the rates of HCHO synthesis and of incipient stoichiometric reduction of MoOx domains by H 2 as the domain size increases and as the supports become less insulating and more reducible, and as the energy required for ligand-to-metal electronic transitions in the UV–visible spectrum decreases.

The reaction is catalysed by molyb-denum oxide supported on titania, in a flow reactor under ambient pressure. High selectivity to acetalde-hyde (70 %– 89 %, {{depending on the}} Mo loading) is obtained at 150 8 C.

As their surface density increases, the monomeric mo-lybdenum oxide species undergo two-dimensional and three-dimensional oligomerisation. This results in <b>polymolybdates</b> and molybdenum oxide crystalli-tes. Importantly, the ethanol oxidation rate depends not only on the overall molybdenum loading and dis-persion, but also on the type of molybdenum oxide species prevalent at each surface density and on the domain size.

TPSR in CH 4 stream revealed that Mo species were reduced {{in at least two}} different stages before the formation of benzene. TPR results were in agreement with TPSR results.

40|$|Nickel, {{molybdenum}} {{and nickel}} molybdenum catalysts supported on niobia and on alumina were prepared by wet-point impregnation and calcination at 723 K. The catalysts were characterised in their calcined form using nitrogen adsorption (BET method), X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy in the UV visible region, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and temperature-programmed reduction. Pronounced support effects were observed {{on the nature}} of the supported species. Thus, on alumina, the molybdenum was highly dispersed and predominantly present as <b>polymolybdate</b> clusters while, on niobia, there was evidence for a strong molybdena-support interaction, possibly with formation of a mixed niobium molybdenum oxide. The alumina support strongly stabilised supported oxidic nickel species towards reduction, in contrast with the niobia support. This was explained by a smaller polarisation of the Ni-O bond in the niobia than in the alumina environment. On alumina, the nickel and molybdenum oxidic species, when simultaneously present in the catalysts, interacted preferentially with each other rather than with the support, whereas the opposite occurred on the niobia support...|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{we report}} the {{synthesis}} of silver decamolybdate, Ag 6 Mo 10 O 33, nanostructure by a simple mechanohemical process followed by calcination treatment using acetamide as driving agent. Morphological study by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images revealed bundles of rods grown closely together with an average diameter of 92 nm for Ag 6 Mo 10 O 33 sample. Ni-substituted Ag 6 Mo 10 O 33 compound was prepared via introducing nickel cation to precursor system in mechanical milling step. The particle size decreased to 87 nm by incorporating nickel units in substituted <b>polymolybdate.</b> It was concluded that the suitable selection of reagents can direct solid phase reaction towards producing nanostructured products. This technique is easy and simple for preparation of various mixed metal oxides without using any solvents and or complex procedures. In addition, the photocatalytic activity of the prepared products was studied on the removal of 4 -nitro phenol (4 -NP) as organic pollutant from water. The obtained results were also discussed in detail...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of oxidative desulfurization of commercial diesel by alumina supported <b>polymolybdate</b> based catalyst system was studied using tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as an oxidizing agent. Transition metals such as Fe, Co and Cu were introduced {{onto the surface}} of alumina, prior to the impregnation of MoO 3. The results showed that the oxidation of sulfur in commercial diesel with TBHP decreased in the order: Fe/MoO 3 /Al 2 O 3 > Co/MoO 3 /Al 2 O 3 > Cu/MoO 3 /Al 2 O 3. Further investigations on doped molybdenum revealed that Fe/MoO 3 /Al 2 O 3, calcined at 500 °C was the best catalyst in this study. The catalyst was able to reduce sulfur levels in commercial diesel from 440 ppmw to less than 18 ppmw. In addition, 96 % of total sulfur was removed after a second extraction. Based on our results, the reaction mechanisms for oxidation of sulfur compound, in the presence of Fe/MoO 3 /Al 2 O 3 catalyst, to the corresponding sulfones may be suggested...|$|E
40|$|The precise {{nature of}} the polyanions formed {{by the action of}} {{hydrochloric}} acid on sodium molybdate solutions has been studied by pH and conductometric measurements involving glass electrode and conductometric titrations. The inflections and breaks in the titration curves indicate the formation of para-Mo 7 O 24 (6 -) and octa-Mo 8 O 26 (4 -) <b>polymolybdate</b> anions around pH 5. 5 and 4. 1, corresponding to the molar; ratio 8 H: 7 Mo and 3 H: 2 Mo, respectively. Similar pH and conductometric titrations between Hg 2 + and MoO 4 (2 -), Mo 7 O 24 (6 -), and Mo 8 O 26 (4 -) provide definite evidence for the formation of normal molybdate HgO.

40|$|A {{series of}} 3. 0 Mo/(H beta+gamma-Al 2 O 3) samples with gamma-Al 2 O 3 {{contents}} {{in the range}} of 0 - 100 % (mass fraction) was studied by means of XRD, NH 3 -TPD, TPR and BET determinations for characterizing their structures. The H beta zeolite structure in the 3. 0 Mo/H beta sample can be effectively stabilized by adding some gamma-Al 2 O 3 to H beta zeolite. gamma-Al 2 O 3 mainly favors the formation of <b>polymolybdate</b> or multilayered Mo oxide, while H beta mainly forms the Al- 2 (MoO 4) (3) species, as evaluated by the TPR, technique. When used as the catalyst for the metathesis of butylene- 2 and ethylene to propylene, there exists a close correlation between the specific surface area and stability of the catalyst. The specific surface area of the catalyst shows the maximum when (H beta+gamma-Al 2 O 3) contains 30 %gamma-Al 2 O 3, which is in agreement with that of the time needed for the reaction stablization. In the case of maximum surface area, the rate of coke deposition is the minimum...|$|E

40|$|Supported MoS 2 /γ-Al 2 O 3 and Ni-MoS 2 /γ-Al 2 O 3 {{as well as}} {{unsupported}} Ni-MoS 2 {{were investigated}} in the hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) of quinoline {{in the presence of}} dibenzothiophene (DBT). The supported oxide catalyst precursors had a well-dispersed amorphous <b>polymolybdate</b> structure that {{led to the formation of}} a highly dispersed sulfide phase. In contrast, the unsupported catalyst precursor consisted of a mixture of nickel molybdate and ammonium nickel molybdate phases that formed stacked sulfide slabs after sulfidation. On all catalysts, the reaction pathway for the removal of N in quinoline HDN mainly followed the sequence quinoline[RIGHTWARDS ARROW] 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydroquinoline[RIGHTWARDS ARROW]decahydroquinoline[RIGHTWARDS ARROW]propylcyclohexylamine[RIGHTWARDS ARROW]propylcyclohexene[RIGHTWARDS ARROW]propylcyclohexane. The hydrodesulfurization of DBT proceeded mainly by direct desulfurization towards biphenyl. For both processes, the activity increased in the order MoS 2 /γ-Al 2 O 3 <Ni-MoS 2 /unsupported<Ni-MoS 2 /γ-Al 2 O 3. The promotion of the MoS 2 phase with Ni enhances the activity of the unsupported catalyst to a greater extent than the supported one. However, the multiply stacked unsupported Ni-MoS 2 exhibited lower rates than Ni-MoS 2 /γ-Al 2 O 3 because of its lower dispersion...|$|E
