Particular mention may be made of rule 4 of the act of 1887, relating to the inspection of conditions as to gas ventilation beyond appointed stations Gencrar [...] {{at the entrance to}} the mine or different parts of the mine; this rule generally removed the earlier distinction between mines in which inflammable gas has been found within the preceding twelve months, and mines in which it has not been so found; of rules 8, 9, 10 and 11, relating to the construction, use, &c., of safety lamps, which are more detailed and stringent than rule 7 of the act of 1872, which they replaced; of rule 12, relating to the use of explosives below ground; of rule 24, which requires the appointment of a competent male person not less than twenty-two years of age for working the machinery for lowering and raising persons at the mine; of rule 34, which first required provision of ambulances or stretchers with splints and bandages at the mine ready for immediate use; of rule 38, which strengthened the provision for <b>periodical</b> <b>inspection</b> of the mine by practical miners on behalf of the workmen at their own cost. With reference to the last-cited rule, during 1898 a Prussian mining commission visited Great Britain, France and Belgium, to study and compare the various methods of inspection by working miners established in these three countries. They found that, so far as the method had been applied, it was most satisfactory in Great Britain, where the whole cost is borne by the workers' own organisations, and they attributed part of the decrease in number of accidents per thousand employed since 1872 to the inauguration of this system.|$|E

40|$|Power plants require <b>periodical</b> <b>{{inspection}}s</b> {{to control}} their state. To ensure a safe opera-tion, parts that could fail before the next inspection are repaired or replaced, since a forced outage due to a failure can cost up to millions of dollars per day. Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) methods are used to detect different defects that could occur, such as cracks, thin-ning, corrosion or pitting. Some parts are inspected directly in situ, but {{may be difficult to}} access; these can require opening access holes or building scaffoldings. Other parts are disassembled and inspected in workshops, when the required inspection tools cannot be moved. In this thesis, we developed innovative miniature mobile systems able to move within these small and complex installations and inspect them. Bringing sensors to difficult-to-access places using climbing robots can reduce the inspection time and costs, because some dismantling or scaffolding can be eliminated. New miniature sensors can help to inspect complex parts without disassembling them, and reduce the inspection costs, as well. To perform such inspections, miniature mobile systems require a high mobility and kee...|$|R

Performing PSA and utilizing the risk information for non-reactor nuclear facilities also has the same role in securing safe operation effectively and rationally as in the nuclear power plants. Taking into account the safety characteristics of reprocessing plants in which radioactive materials exist scattered in several chemical processes and storage facilities, we should evaluate risks of many events efficiently and systematically with various types, scenarios, frequencies and consequences in order to assess whole risk and its profile of the plant. A simplified PSA method for the Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant has been developed, incorporating previously conducted detailed PSA results of some representing events.

40|$|Unmanned {{underwater}} vehicles (UUVs) {{are ideal}} tools to implement underwater monitoring missions. Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) {{are often used}} to accomplish <b>periodical</b> <b>inspections</b> of jacket structures of offshore platforms. A stereo vision based method is used to navigate the vehicle to locate itself {{with the aid of}} environmental reference information. In this paper, a robust scheme is proposed for the missions. After acquisition of stereo image pairs, 3 D information is extracted from them. Specific steps include feature extraction and tracking. The SURF (Speeded Up Robust Features) algorithm is used to achieve real-time tracking performance. Due to the noise impact, there are a certain number of outliers in 3 D point clouds. A Coarse-To-Fine (CTF) method is proposed to eliminate them. Resorting to SVD (singular value decomposition) method, which can give a close-form solution of rotation matrix and translation vector of the vehicle, the motion is estimated using the maximal subset of inliers.

Design and modeling are {{carried out by the}} use of program moduli connected with the airfoil data base. Among them, there are: aerodynamic analysis, determination of centrifugal forces, torque, shear and normal stresses. In the final stage of the design it has been applied a system for automatic delivery of of technical documentation of composite fan blade. Geometric description is supported by program packages AutoCAD. This part is realised by program language AutoLISP. Before actual production of blades, it has been necessary to design and manufacture a proper mould, according to the blade geometry data. Mould is made of composite material, by "dry " procedure. In addition to the mould, it was also necessary to design and manufacture the polimerisation furnace. Fan blades are made of composite material, by "wet" procedure. Before the final mounting there is a visual inspection of the blades and corresponding joints.

40|$|Background: Occupational {{accidents}} are unplanned events that cause damage. The socio-economic impacts and human costs of {{accidents are}} tremendous around the world. Many fatalities happen {{every year in}} workplaces such as electricity distribution companies. Some electrical injuries are electrocution, electric shock, and burns. This {{study was conducted in}} an electricity distribution company (with rotational 12 -hour shift work) in Iran during an 8 -year period to survey descriptive factors of injuries. Methods: Variables collected included accident time, age of injured worker, employment type, work experience, injury cause, educational background, and other information about accidents. Results: Results indicated that most of the accidents occurred in summer, and 51. 3 % were during shift work. Worker negligence (malpractice) was the cause of 75 % of deaths. Type of employment had a significant relationship with type of injuries (p <  0. 05). Most injuries were electrical burns. Conclusion: High rate of accidents in summer {{may be due to the}} warm weather or insufficient professional skills in seasonal workers. Shift workers are at risk of sleep complaints leading to a high rate of work injuries. Acquiring knowledge about safety was related to job experiences. Temporary workers have no chance to work all year like permanent workers, therefore impressive experiences may be less in them.
