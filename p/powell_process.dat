40|$|In Regents of the University of California v. Bakke (1978), the Supreme Court {{issued a}} {{landmark}} decision addressing {{the constitutionality of}} university affirmative action policies. Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. concluded that universities could consider race as a factor to achieve {{the goal of a}} diverse student body. This study situates Bakke within its broader rhetorical environment of public discourses about race, law, and education, examining the selection <b>process</b> by which <b>Powell</b> found “diversity” to be the most justifiable {{answer to the question of}} affirmative action's permissibility. Using materials retrieved from Powell's archives at Washington and Lee University, including memoranda, personal notes, and draft opinions, the project makes three interrelated arguments. First, this study asserts that the Supreme Court is a rhetorical institution, dependent upon rhetoric for its inventional needs and its credibility while simultaneously cloaking its reliance on rhetorical invention in a rhetoric of formalistic inevitability. As such, it attends to how the legal invention process, explicated by classical rhetorical theorists and manifest in contemporary legal practice, enhances understanding of Powell's decision. Second, the project examines how Powell pulled from far-reaching rhetorical and ideological environments for his “diversity” rationale. Here, the study traces public discourses about race and examines Bakke's legal briefs, outlining the appeals to multiculturalism, colorblindness, race consciousness, and individualism that comprised Powell's inventional warehouse. A critical scrutiny of <b>Powell's</b> opinion-writing <b>process</b> reveals an inventional program guided by an ideological negotiation of these competing and compelling rhetorics of race and education in the United States. Third, this project argues that <b>Powell's</b> opinion-writing <b>process</b> is a corporate, rather than individual, process. Examining the negotiations between Powell, his law clerks, and fellow justices further illuminates the rhetorical nature of the Court, as well as the ideological influences upon individual Court opinions. The study concludes by explicating how Bakke reflects the ways that the Supreme Court works as part of a broader rhetorical culture, constructing its decisions from the materials of public arguments and the architecture of jurisprudential norms. Finally, the study explores the ideological circulation of Powell's decision: divorcing the goal of diversity from the justification of past discrimination...|$|R

This led to G.S. Baker's and G.W. Perks's process of making hollow chocolate eggs in 1910.

40|$|New {{methods are}} {{presented}} that utilize the optimization of goodness-of-fit statistics {{in order to}} estimate Weibull parameters from failure data. It is assumed that the underlying population {{is characterized by a}} three-parameter Weibull distribution. Goodness-of-fit tests are based on the empirical distribution function (EDF). The EDF is a step function, calculated using failure data, and represents an approximation of the cumulative distribution function for the underlying population. Statistics (such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic and the Anderson-Darling statistic) measure the discrepancy between the EDF and the cumulative distribution function (CDF). These statistics are minimized with respect to the three Weibull parameters. Due to nonlinearities encountered in the minimization <b>process,</b> <b>Powell's</b> numerical optimization procedure is applied to obtain the optimum value of the EDF. Numerical examples show the applicability of these new estimation methods. The results are compared to the estimates obtained with Cooper's nonlinear regression algorithm...|$|R
50|$|Little {{is known}} about the habits of chiton in general but {{observations}} have been made to further understand the processes relating to spawning amongst other <b>processes</b> (<b>Powell,</b> 1961). Early research conducted {{by a member of the}} great barrier reef investigation in Queensland saw that a common chiton of this area seemed to every time choose a night of full moon to conduct its spawning (Powell, 1961). This also depended on the conditions at the time as if they were not favourable or the sea was rough, spawning would not occur and was delayed until the next full moon. This was the case even if in between full moons was a favourable time period where the weather was right (Powell, 1961). We now know that the spawning of chiton is usually synchronous but not necessarily correlated with any particular stage of the lunar or solar cycle.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{will argue}} that Anthony Powell's A Dance to the Music of Time is a work that can tell us much about our reading <b>process.</b> <b>Powell</b> uses a homodiegetic narrator to tell the stories of {{a vast array of}} {{characters}} over a large span of time. This narrator, Nicholas Jenkins, is, in the non-sexual sense of the word, voyeuristic. He watches and remembers the actions of others while only participating minimally. Widmerpool, the only other character to appear in all twelve volumes, is a voyeur in the sexual sense of the word. The defining feature of voyeurism is its fundamental asymmetry: the voyeur watches whilst remaining hidden and unseen. It will be argued that the reader is also involved in acts of voyeurism due to his/her asymmetrical relationship with the text. Although this equation of voyeurism and reading may seem to contradict recent reader-response critics, it will be argued that voyeurism is an apt description for the primary stage of reading...|$|R

To date, there are no validated instruments to measure the ability of a facilitator to effectively debrief learners after a patient simulation. This poster describes phase one of a pilot study to develop and evaluate an instrument that assesses the effectiveness of a debriefing facilitator. The instrument is based on the current scientific literature and was tested to establish reliability and validity. In phase one, the Delphi Technique was selected as it has been shown to be a cost effective method of generating ideas and achieving consensus on a particular issue where there is a lack of empirical evidence (<b>Powell,</b> 2003).

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} case study {{regarding}} the raising of {{a new form of}} governance of education policy in a province of the south of Italy. The focus is on the constitution and the implementation of a new instrument of governance, the “Conference of zone”, promoted by a local authority (a province). The conference is a collective actor that involves all the relevant stakeholders of the local arena within the educational planning processes. Since the late 90 s the italian education system has been increasingly restructured after a long period of non-decision making (Benadusi, 1984). The italian reforms can be placed within a broader reforming trajectory that involves many OECD countries and is driven by institutional isomorphich <b>processes</b> (<b>Powell,</b> DiMaggio, 1991). The rhetorics of educational reforms (Edwards, 1997, Derouet, 2000, Ball, 2005) conveys the necessity of changing the governance of educational field, moving from a rule-governing perspective (the dominant mode of organizing of that organizational field in welfaristic model) to a objective-oriented approach (to be considered more attuned to post-welfaristic approach). This passage implies the re-balancing of the main organizations of the field where, at least in principle, the ‘centralistic and bureaucratic mode’ is replaced by a ‘devolved environment’ with an increasing relevance attributed to local authorities (municipalities, regions, and so on) (Rhodes, 1997), and the establishment of “locus” of dialogue and coordination between the organizations working in the same field. In Italy the education system has been changed along two different paths: on the one hand schools have become autonomous, in terms of organizing capacity, educative planning and designing, financial budgeting. On the other hand a relevant part of the “old” Ministry of Education competencies have been decentred towards local authorities such as regions, provinces and municipalities, who become central actors in the local regulation processes of education. As a consequence of these reforms, the field of the education policy has deeply changed at the macro {{as well as at the}} meso level and new local policy arenas have been “constituted”. The case of the province analyzed in the paper is widely considered an example of best practice in the italian national scenario. The province has classified its territory in districts, creating a “conference of zone” for each of them. The conference represents an emerging “collective actor” leaded by the province and involves all the relevant stakeholders of the educational field in the domestic decision making processes regarding educational planning and scholastic building. In order to qualify the mode of governance emerging in the reshaped local educational arenas taken into consideration and in order to understand the role of the conferences as new emergent collective actors, we have chosen to adopt ideas drawn by Giddens theory of structuration (Giddens, 1976; 1979; 1984) and new institutionalism approach (Powell, DiMaggio, 1991; DiMaggio, 1991; Barley, Tolbert, 1997). The analysis of the interactions within the conferences and in the other “locus” of the local educational governance will be conducted in terms of signification (meaning production), dominance (power relations) and legitimation (norms production). It will allow us to highlight the role of the conferences as points of trasformation of the structural properties (Giddens, 1984) of the local educational system. The analysis of the modalities of structuration will be carried out through the classification of the scripts recurring during the interactions (Barley, 1986; Barley, Tolbert, 1997). Specific objects of analysis will be the strategic conduct (Giddens, 1979) of the different actors involved in the interactions, the developing of the dialectic of control and the unintended consequences of the different conducts (Giddens, 1984). The analysis will show how the conferences represent an instrument for Province’s actors to put themselves as an obligatory point of passage within the new “circuit of power” (Clegg, 1987) of the local educational governance. At the same time the conferences constitute a new kind of “front region” (Giddens, 1984) where decision making processes are revealed and submitted to intersubjective control of the educational arena. This duplicity of the conference implementation process implies an increase of the accountability for all the actors involved as well as the return of some core issues regarding the education policy to the “back regions”, typical of the bureaucratic mode of regulation...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we would like}} to present a case study {{regarding}} the raising of a new form of governance of education policy in a province of the south of Italy.

40|$|Markets are fluid. Over time, the {{dominant}} designs, processes and paradigms that define an industry invariably succumb to productive innovation or changes in fashion (Arthur, 2009; Schumpeter, 1942; Simmel, 1957). Take {{for example the}} recent upheaval of the cell phone market following Apple's release of the iPhone. When it was introduced in 2007, one could clearly differentiate Apple's product from all others; however, subsequent imitation of the iPhone produced a market in which nearly all cell phones look (and perform) alike. The iPhone was a harbinger of the new dominant design. These cycles of innovation and fashion {{are not limited to}} consumer markets. Business markets (often defined by longer term inter-firm relationships) are subject to similar transformations. For example, current practices in the biotechnology industry are quite distinct from those accompanying its emergence from university labs {{in the second half of}} the 20 th century (Powell et al., 2005). Technologies that were once viewed as radical have undergone a process of legitimation and integration into mainstream healthcare delivery systems. Practices that were dominant in the 1980 's gave way to newer business models in the 1990 's and feedback from down-stream providers changed the way drugs were delivered to patients (Wolff, 2001). During periods of transition, market actors face great difficulty anticipating reactions to their behavior (practices, products, etc.). How they deal with this uncertainty is an interminable source of academic inquiry in the social sciences (see e. g. Alderson, 1965; Simon, 1957; Thompson, 1967) and, in a broad sense, it is the primary concern of the current work as well. However, I am focused specifically on the turmoil caused by transitions in technology, taste and attention over time [...] the disagreements which occur as market actors collectively shift their practices from one paradigm to the next (Powell and Colyvas, 2008). If innovations are assumed to arise locally and diffuse gradually (see e. g. Bass, 1969; Rogers, 2002), then transient differences in knowledge are a natural outcome. Those closest to, or most interested in an innovation will have greater knowledge than those furthest away or less involved. Thus, for a period following some shift in technology, taste or attention, market participants will vary in their knowledge and interpretation of the change. In the following chapters, I investigate the ramifications of this sort of knowledge heterogeneity on the exchange behavior and subsequent performance of market participants. It is the central argument of this thesis that this heterogeneity affects exchange by both limiting coordination and increasing quality uncertainty. The details of this argument are fleshed out in Chapters 1, 2 and 3 (summarized below), which build upon each other in a progression from abstract, to descriptive to specific tests of theory. However, each can also stand by itself as an independent examination of the knowledge-exchange relationship. The final chapter synthesizes my findings and highlights some implications for practitioners and further research. In Chapter 1, I review the history and development of Alderson's (1965) 'law of exchange' in the marketing literature and propose an extension based on insights from information theory. A concept called market entropy is introduced to describe the distribution of knowledge in a field and propositions are offered to explain the exchange behavior expected when this distribution changes. Chapter 2 investigates knowledge heterogeneity through its relation with written language. Drawing on social-constructionist theories of classification (Goldberg, 2012) and insights from research on the legitimation <b>process</b> (<b>Powell</b> and Colyvas, 2008), I argue for a measure of field-level consensus based on changes in the frequency distribution of descriptive words over time. This measure is operationalized using eleven years of trade journal articles from the biotech industry and is shown to support the propositions offered in Chapter 1. Chapter 3 builds on the arguments and evidence developed in Chapters 1 and 2 to test theory on the structural advantages of a firm's position in a network of strategic alliances. Prior work has documented returns to network centrality based on the premise that central firms have greater and more timely access to information about industry developments (Powell et al., 1996, 1999). However, other research claims that benefits to centrality accrue based on the signal that such a position provides about an actor's underlying quality (Malter, 2014; Podolny, 1993, 2005). I investigate this tension in the literature and offer new insights based on interactions between network position and the measure developed in Chapter 2...|$|R
